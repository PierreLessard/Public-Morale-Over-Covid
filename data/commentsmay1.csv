Not true. It seems impossible that there would be any confirmed cases on territories like Baker Island, Howland Island, or Navassa Island.

The US did not limit travel in and out of infected zones, did not isolate all those entering the country or a little infected zone. 

Australia and New Zealand, etc. shut their borders very early and dramatically. Anyone entering their territories was obliged to self-isolate at their own cost for 2 weeks (entries limited to citizens and legal immigrants). 

In France people were fined for being more than 1km from their homes. To leave, they needed to get a document from the internet describing where and why they were out of that 1k radius from their home address. That is how you enforce ""distancing"". 

Today in France, the limit is 100km or about 60 miles - as they open up slowly, with restrictions. 

If NYC (and the other early ""hot spots"") had acted to stop/control people from leaving or going into the infected areas, many thousands of lives might have been saved and hundreds of thousands of jobs could have continued, with precautions, in the less infected areas - allowing the focus and efforts to be concentrated on the hot spots. 

Maybe a lesson will be learned. Sealing off infected from non infected places saves lives and economies!"

Our governor put in place quarantines and social distancing, closed restaurants (except for call in/take out), salons and other non essential businesses, but hardware stores, KMart, gas and and groceries remained open.

Assuming then that the nano sized virus menace which has used close to 4 million people so far as fodder to proliferate it will NOT be kicked out of our planet. We should never have shut down businesses , destroyed jobs and commerce and caused hardship of hunger and misery as a response to the virus. Panic pandemic is what is causing more grave harm than the rascal terrorist virus itself. 

In the absence of a deployable vaccine on the horizon, acquiring life long protective immunity against the virus either due to the infection of adults under 60 or due to nano exposure to the virus, the virus is not going anywhere fast. It is firmly embedded in human lungs across the world. Time is of the essence either we wait for a vaccine till cows come home or we do all we can to contain the virus with LIQUID VIRUS KILLERS both the multiple ones that can kill viruses but which cannot be taken orally or we safely drink the ONLY ONE found globally which will kill enveloped viruses like COVID-19 without causing any harm.

A big difference between those with critical symptoms (including death) and those with mild symptoms is their Vitamin D3 blood level.  

In fact, the U.K. now recommends vitamin D supplementation.  You won't hear that recommendation in the U.S. because we are pharma controlled - if pharma can't make a profit, it's no good.

An April study looked at 212 C19 patients and their D3 levels.  Of the mild cases, 96% had D3 levels over 30 ng/ml. 

Of the severe or critical cases, only 4% had D3 over 30 ng/ml.  

What you really want is a D3 level around 70 ng/ml,
which you get with 10,000 IUs/day.  It's a cheap test every PCP should routinely provide.  

Note that sunshine for 30 mins in your bathing suit will provide 20,000 IUs.  But there will be side-effects - whatever nagging problems you have will quickly disappear.  D3 is the master coordinator of your immune system, so it's a cure-all.

The healthcare industry had a problem in the 1930's, the hospitals and MDs were going out of business because people were taking 25 mg of D3 (that's 1,000,000 IUs/day), so they changed D3 ""mg"" to IUs to make it look like too much.  Everyone started getting sick again and the healthcare industry was saved.  

In the old days they put D3 in everything, including beer.  Google ""beer Vitamin D"" and click on images."

What history has taught us is that flu type viruses almost disappear during the summer and return in the winter.

The medical community speculates that heat and humidity is harmful to the virus. More likely is the fact that in the summer, people, just by accident practice social distancing, ie don't stay in crowded indoor places and move about freely outside. This is a more provable reason.

for starters, examining the ""stringency scale"" graphics (at the link in the article) shows that the regression line of stringency level on covid case counts is essentially flat. in other words: stringency has no correlation with pandemic management outcomes. 

this seems to be a clear indication that the index is flawed; for example, because imposing stringency after the pandemic has run amok is not as effective as imposing restrictions early. timing is not part of the index.

the second problem is the explanatory model: ""people beaten down don't mind being beaten down again."" exactly the reverse is sociologically accurate: people find it tremendously frustrating to approach a return to normalcy after a financial or conflict catastrophe, only to find themselves pushed back into restrictions.

what seems to characterize the successful nations -- croatia, greece, singapore, south korea -- is that they are ethnically unified, small, relatively politically unified (the central government far outweighs local authorities) and accustomed to government restrictions. 

things play out very differently in a fractured, large, politically polarized and ""live free or die"" culture such as the united states or, on a smaller scale, in the ethnically diverse and ""brexit"" polarized england.

the moral is that a ""one size fits all"" explanation won't suffice in a pandemic where the disease shows a strong interaction with culture."

Due to a shortage of ET tubing caused by Jared and Ivanka selling it all on the international market at gouging prices, there won't be anything to use for you when you get to whatever hospital is going to have to be forced to treat you when you get there.

So we've asked the Army Corps of Engineers to lend us some razor wire to use for your intubation.  Don't worry, we're marinating it in hydroxychloroquine and bleach, and will be installing a tiny UVC LED to the end of it to implant in your lungs so you'll be just as evil as new when you get out.

I'm more than upset at the coverage of this outbreak at the White House by the NYTimes.  The takehome message isn't that if the people at the White House get it nobody's safe.  The takehome message is that they've been acting like royalty and telling the little people to go out and die while they've got their own test machine and get lava mad if they aren't safe.  The takehome message is that every single person who's had this disease, who has had a relative die from it, or who has quarantined in good faith are hoping for some payback from the virus against the sludge of seeping evil that is this White House.

It’s my solemn belief that if you don’t learn the lessons of your own hubris and mistakes in life, they keep repeating, becoming more serious in consequence, until the day you finally listen. The sooner you listen, and learn, the lesser the stakes.

Then Fox News will declare that Trump has always wanted to wear a mask but Adam Schiff prevented him from doing so and why isn't Adam Schiff in jail anyway?

The most appalling thing isn't Trump's appalling behavior.  The appalling and frightening thing is that more than the usual 10 or 15%  of the population that one expects to report being abducted by flying saucers, endorses what normally would be considered a weird inexplicable lunatic fringe and stands behind whatever Trump says. Sadly, his declining polls still have more than 40% on his side.

Maybe now you will see the wisdom of slowing down your current race to ""reopen"" America at a pace that is not supported by science.

Trump is very concerned about his OWN susceptibility to Coronavirus therefore, he was annoyed that his valet (who served him food) was not wearing masks prior to getting infected. Trump lives in a bubble with close associates who get tested on an ongoing basis so he remains safe to project his carefully calibrated image of invincibility by not wearing masks yet he himself gets tested on a regular basis. This is height of hypocrisy and total lack of empathy towards human lives. Image is everything for this former Reality TV actor who probably still thinks that this pandemic is another episode of a Reality TV show. 

Trump is more concerned about the re-opening of the country to boost his chances for re-election as opposed to containing the pandemic in order to save innocent lives. He is yet to show any iota of sympathy for the victims and their families.

True patriots donate to food banks, volunteer to help others.
The threat is the virus and what it can and will do to the country we profess to love. True patriots do what they can to defend against the damage this virus can do.

Does Trump think the American people are that stupid?  If it is so ineffective, then why are those “close” to Trump being tested every day?

The main point of increased testing is to find out as early as possible who is contagious and quickly get them isolated at home, where they cannot spread it any further.  Also to get those close to them into a preventive quarantining.

Had Miller only been tested every third day instead of every day, everyone around her at the WH would have been exposed to her contagious state for 2 additional days before she was sent home – a whopping 200% of additional risk of infection to those around her.

All the people  who have been appointed to the WH,who are after all warriors in the battle against the virus, should continue to not wear masks and disregard the CDC suggestions that Trump  himself said the country should ignore.  We can then extrapolate how many of them contract the virus and use that to project the number of infections for the rest of us."

2020-05-10 22:44:49,"Trump had an opportunity to be a hero to a nation by tackling this crisis head on.  Had he only listened and believed the national security briefings!  Or faced reality in January or February.  Or listened to his own health experts in March.  The Republican Senate had a chance to be a hero to the nation at any point in this timeline by pulling their president aside and telling him clearly and forcefully that he had to get in line and follow the science or they would desert him.  But no, as W.E. B. DuBois said, ""the silence and neglect of science can let truth utterly disappear."""

2020-05-10 22:48:43,"Perhaps these known cases of coronavirus  infection among White House staff will further  expose the disinformation coming out of the Trump administration regarding the importance of testing for the coronavirus. Now senior administration officials including the Directors of the NIH, FDA and CDC are self isolating for 14 days. According to reports released late today, even Vice President Pence and presidential advisor Stephen Miller are staying away from the White House because of possible exposure.

It is hypocritical that those working in the White House have access to testing for the coronavirus on a frequent, if daily basis.  Yet, testing continues to be difficult to get for the American people. Testing is not even readily  available for those performing essential jobs and medical professionals working directly with coronavirus patients. 

Why has Trump not made testing for the people a priority?  Because he knows that testing will reveal just how many people in the nation are actually infected.  Time for Trump and the White House to step up and be warriors."

“So do I,” said Gandalf, “and so do all who live to see such times. But that is not for them to decide. All we have to decide is what to do with the time that is given us.”

I’ve been thinking about this JRR Tolkien passage from Lord of the Rings and thoughts others might find it inspiring, so long as you can keep from applying the quote to the “leadership” from the White House. 

Personally, it gives me focus. 

Do the good you can do wherever you are. That matters now more than ever. 

One small thing you can decide to do is to wear a mask and try to give fellow humans six feet of space."

not have a plan for making the workplace safer for the employees? HR in my workplace had a plan before we all started to work remotely.

And false positives aside, with all the regular testing they’ve received - particularly people close to the President - how did any of these WH employees contract the virus, unless they weren’t abiding by the warnings so stay distant inside and outside the office? 

My intention isn’t to be harsh and I understand how elusive the virus is but the WH ought to be the best place in the country to stay safe, no?"

I wish President Trump would start wearing a mask, and I also wish Governor Cuomo would start wearing one too. 

It would hopefully send a message that masks are one of the most effective ways to prevent being infected by the virus, as well as infecting others."
2020-05-10 23:08:01,"Back when people read there was an excellent, very short story by Edgar Allan Poe entitled ""The Masque of the Red Death."" It depicted a time when a deadly plague ravaged a nation. The country's ruler, Prince Prospero, retreated with his minions to a safe haven, leaving those outside its walls to their fate. But the Red Death found its way inside that sanctuary and all perished.
I hadn't thought about this story for decades. It suddenly leapt to mind after I heard about President Trump's furor when he learned that some of the White House staff had tested positive for Covid-19. His immediate reaction was to have all safety measures redoubled to keep him protected. At the same time he's pressing for the rest of the country to face sickness and death in order to preserve the economy."

2020-05-10 23:08:33,"If We The People have to work without tests why does Trump now test everyone so much?  Why do they get the protection of tests and Trump shrugs off any responsibility for actual tests available to us?  Trump just lies and says everyone can get a test, and our tests are the best - lies just to get him off the hook so he can bloviate and watch TV while we die literally by the minute."

The president of the United States, like an emperor, uses the tests for himself and his entire staff on a daily basis, then flouts all the rules the rest of us follow because he is safe. But no tests for you stupid plebeians. Trump would kill them all right away if they weren't potential voters, as a matter of fact, isn't that what he is doing to the poor, the black, the brown, the healthcare worker, the firefighter and the grocery clerk? This is genocide. No different than any other mass murder. It is not just preventable, it is intentional."

Um. Anyone who listened to Dr. Fauci knew."

I say this because I had the test last week at my doctor's office after showing symptoms and it hurts (if you're getting the real test).  It's like they're drilling into your brain right through a nerve - it'll leave your eyes watering.  There is no way a wuss like trump would undergo such a procedure on a regular basis.  

I say ""real test"" because my friend on the same test when to our local health department and they 'tested' her using a regular cotton swab they have in doctor's offices and just ran it around the inside of her nose."

2020-05-10 23:17:20,"So Hope Hicks gets tested daily.  Yet how many died for lack of that same test?  The same test that Hope's boss hasn't made every effort to provide for the rest of the nation.  You can also be sure that the entire Trump clan has access, as does apparently ever celebrity.  

It's clear that access is about privilege, and what is equally clear is that the wealthy rather enjoy the privilege no matter how many tweets pretend otherwise.  If ever there was a Maria Antoinette moment in American history, it's now and plain as day.   ""Let them eat cake"", as in go untested, lose jobs, but do make sure you get tested and please, tell us about it in your next post.  It's so important to know that Hope et al are safe."
2020-05-10 23:21:46,"I do not understand why such measures are being taken with Trump.  He is disdainful of every meaningful approach, he has been not just worthless but arguably detrimental in combating the pandemic, and any supplies in the WH could better be used elsewhere.

This Virus doesn't care that he thinks he is special or that he thinks he doesn't look good in a mask. It doesn't care that he was raised rich and thinks he can flout any rule. Reality has hit him at 73 years of age. It took a long time.
His staff should have been doing what we've all been doing for months now, wearing masks, working from home, social distancing. And that Abott test is doing what we predicted. Giving false confidence due to its high false negative rate. Science."

They had adopted my protocols including standoff detection and the use of laser excitation of key indicator molecules of cloud and areas and the preparation for biological warfare and the presence and location of such contamination and infestations. 

Preventive warfare was key. So if we knew how to locate, find indicators, and decon, what happened to that knowledge? Attacking the White House, congressional offices, and other sites were well known targets. 

Now imagine key invasive species spread thruout our planet. This is likely to takeoff one of these days. Of course, it is already happening with pythons and killer bees and plant infestations. 

Let us stop making excuses and act. And don’t tell me it ideal Trump! Which presidents and Congresses have done the basics since WW II?

And if you want to worry about N Korean nukes, they are facing the USA but in a moment can be spun around and fired towards N Korea’s biggest concern, human waves of Chinese troops repeating their Korean War invasion and devastations.￼

Time to hit the white walls and look at all the reasonable invasions and invasive.

Let our readers get together in groups and do that and then address what can be usefully done."

The way it is written, it could be 50% or any other number. I did note that later, the article stated that it’s recommended to retest if the person is exhibiting symptoms, common sense of course. Not stupidity which is what appears you wish to convey about the administration.  For many weeks we were told by the very impressive WH virus team not to wear masks, and that they’re more effective keeping a person from spreading the virus as opposed to catching it. The President and company take their cues from them. Now we’re all wearing masks in my state and it makes everyone feel like they’re helping protect themselves, maybe we are, and a lot less people around here are catching it. The WH should try it out more, as should many other states, and along with social distancing etc,  I think a lot more businesses could open successfully, and ASAP! Masks are better than continuing to bankrupt the country."

I'M O.K.""  Perhaps he should be tested for other, even more dangerous (to the world) conditions than Covid-19."
2020-05-10 23:34:55,So sorry our poor little so-called president is spooked because he has ignored medical guidelines and might get sick. Maybe he just needs to think of himself as being a “warrior” and get back to work.
2020-05-10 23:36:48,"Yet another lack of intelligence and foresight. Xi Zingping and Vladimir Putin are isolating. And for the right reason. If Trump and Pence are incapacitated, they can do whatever they want. Quickly and unimpeded. Taiwan and Easter Europe are probably already lined up. And don’t think they haven’t already drawn up plans. They’re probably convinced that Trump is unintelligent enough to actually get infected.
And to think, the US was the only country to oppose a UN global cease fire. Because it contained a reference to the WHO."

You have the arrogance to be annoyed that someone tested positive for Covid19 who had been in close proximity to you as he served you, but we Americans are expected to act like “warriors” as our fathers, mothers, siblings, children & friends are dying at the rate of 1 every 42 seconds because you feel the same about testing as you do about vaccines.

You have the luxury afforded by the taxpayers to be attended to by the best physicians & best healthcare insurance & demand that in order to be in your presence, each visitor, aide or otherwise must undergo testing but you command we Americans act like “warriors” by being separated from our friends & loved ones.

Never, in the history of these United States of America, have we Americans been subjected to such a corrupt, psychopathic carnage as brought about by The Donald’s incompetence. Come November 3rd, we Americans must remove The Donald and the GOP Senate that has protected him & stood quietly by as we Americans died by the tens of thousands.

America!!!

You wouldn't want your surgeon operating on you with his bare hands in his street clothes with no mask, gown or hair protection.  
This is the year 2020 not 1830.  Everyone of these scientific precautions, the masks, the gloves, the gowns, the foot coverings, and the gloves were all put in place for a reason.  During the Civil War men died horrible deaths from infections and gangrene. And, during the later 1800's woman died horrible deaths from Childbed fever. The obstetricians would come straight from the anatomy lab and then deliver the babies.  The woman all got infected and many died. Semmelwise was considered mad when he proposed handwashing and sterile technique.
Trump and Pence think they can fly in the face of scientific reality just because they want to re-open the economy.  
Well, until there is a vaccine, and until there is a valid anti-viral treatment, they have to accept what's going on. 
If everyone wore a mask and gloves they could re-open the economy.  People could wear a mask and get a haircut, go to the movies, even attend a sports event.  But, people today are careless.  They leave their noses exposed, or they wear some token face covering."

What a bunch of idiots.  Trump thinks he will look silly in a mask.  Pence pretends that his staff did not get the memo about mandatory mask wearing when he visited Honeywell.  

Remember Pence went to a football game knowing, in advance, that he was going to walk out if any player kneeled, and that's exactly what happened?  

What is wrong with these people?  

We have two viruses.  

One is COVID-19.  The other one is Trump and his Trump World team.  

We cannot eradicate COVID-19, not even with a vaccine that most experts say won't exist, and then won't be widely available, for at least 12-18 months.

From well before the days of Marie Antoinette's infamous 'let them eat cake', the world has endured leaders who were apathetic, indifferent, even hostile to the woes of those whose interests they were supposed to represent. Clearly Trump is such a person.

There is a belief by some that when such leaders find themselves beset by the same mortal threat as threaten the masses, they will suddenly develop a sense of understanding and compassion. That, unfortunately, is never the case. 

There is no cure for narcissism. At best narcissists can develop coping mechanisms that allow them to project an illusion of empathy. It is not a coping mechanism that Trump has mastered. Anyone observing his public behaviour closely can't help but be overwhelmed by the extent of his detachment from the trials and tribulations of ordinary folk.

2020-05-11 00:40:57,"So now they are between a rock and a hard place.  Trump, Inc. has been lying to the public about the virulence of the virus and safety of reopening - sacrificing lives (and trying to conceal illness and death statistics, at least in Florida) to conceal Trump's incompetence create a false ""recovery"" narrative that they think will reelect Trump.

To do that, they had to ignore CDC guidelines, muzzle Dr. Fauci (who planned to appear before the Senate wearing a mask - but was stopped by Trump, Inc., probably to avoid the visual pun an and otherwise bad optics), and waltz around, mask-less.

So now, they are getting sick.  Either they put on masks - better late than never, destroying the narrative; or they don't and get sicker. Maybe even die.

That, however, will destroy the narrative, too.  So they are not between the rock and hard place, but shipwrecked (or maybe, hoisted on their own petard?).

Trump, Inc. has been lying to the public about the virulence of the virus and safety of reopening - sacrificing lives (and trying to conceal illness and death statistics, at least in Florida) to conceal Trump's incompetence and create a false ""recovery"" narrative that they think will reelect Trump.

To do that, they had to ignore CDC guidelines, muzzle Dr. Fauci (who had planned to appear before the Senate wearing a mask - but was stopped by Trump, Inc., probably to avoid the visual pun and otherwise bad optics). They waltz around, ""warriors,"" preening and mask-less.

So now, they are getting sick.  Either they put on masks - better late than never - destroying the narrative; or they don't, and get sicker. Maybe even die.

That, however, will destroy the narrative, too.  So they are not really between the rock and hard place, but rather shipwrecked (or maybe, hoisted on their own petard?). 

Karma. She's a bad one.  Trump, Inc., et al, are knowingly killing their fellow Americans; now let them walk the walk (plank?)."
2020-05-11 00:43:48,"The Obama administration was working on a special high tech machine which could manufacture 1.5 million masks a day.  Because they figured that it would be too hard to stockpile all those masks and they might expire, with the right number of machines they could easily ramp up production to all the masks they need in a very short period of time. 
Trump in his hatred for all things Obama has cut his nose off to spite his face.  He scuttled the Office which was in charge of preparing for a pandemic, and he never followed through with the high speed mask production machine, or stockpiled more ventilator. 
In short, Trump is now going to reap what he has sown.  
If he had been really smart he and pence would have worn a mask and insisted on everyone around them wearing one as well.  
It's time that the current administration show some respect for the scientific method, not the science fiction lies they try to foist off on the American people.  
And, the first thing people learn about testing is that there can be false positives and false negatives.  Don't bet the farm on either of them. 
And, if Trump or Pence does come down with Covid-19 you can be money they are not going to get that worthless chloroquinone, but the best anti-viral therapy they can find. 
Whoever started this Covid-19 pandemic couldn't have done a better job trying to undermine Trump and the economy and his chances of getting re-elected if they had tried."

It wants the population to live an unhealthy lifestyle so that they can keep feeding the engine to drive the mega machine. It's a never ending cycle. The next generation of kids are already overweight, diabetic etc... The new fresh meat for the machine to consume. And the media, parents, government play a role in this. To fight this virus at it's core you have to change the hearts and minds of the population. Only then can we win this war."

And now Covid 19 has come to President Trump's home and workplace.  A perfect metaphor for the national tragedy that we see and read about every day. 

In reading about how stark the differences are n the level of success the leaderships of Germany, China, South Korea, Taiwan, Singapore, New Zealand etc. have had in meeting the challenge of Covid 19 compared with the galactic failure of the United States, one wonders how it was possible.  Our hospitals, doctors, nurses, therapists and techs are among the  best in the world.  What has happened to us?"

The indisputable fact is Trump never had their backs and did everything to do exactly the opposite. We will never forget."
2020-05-11 01:04:41,"Poor poor babies.  Their total disregard of this virus, and their flippant reaction to deaths and the seriousness of this situation has come back to haunt them. I have no pity for these reckless, insensitive incompetent people."
2020-05-11 01:09:00,"What is the point of getting tested everyday when they are not taking prophylactic measures, ie, wearing a mask? Getting tested every day will not stop you from getting Covid, same as taking a pregnancy test will not prevent you from getting pregnant."
2020-05-11 01:07:15,"Sounds like fake news to me!  COVID-19 is way overblown by the media.

I hope President Trump doesn’t wimp out and start wearing a mask and avoiding political rallies. This is just another attempt by the deep state to take Donald Trump down. The President should change nothing as he is invincible.  Remember him staring into the eclipse with no eye protection even though the “lamestream” media was telling everyone to protect their eyes?"
2020-05-11 01:07:22,"...“It is scary to go to work,” Kevin Hassett, a top economic adviser to the president, said on CBS’s “Face the Nation” program on Sunday...
Hassett will be fired or ""reassigned""  by Tuesday.  He spoke the truth and THAT will not be tolerated at the White House."
2020-05-11 01:07:49,"Very karmic.  Trump, who is responsible along with his incompetent administration, for the pandemic in this country now has it in his house.  But wait that must be fake news.  How could those people have gotten it?  The chickens are coming home to roost."

This is outrageous. It is time for Americans to demand more of the entitled White House."

We have not yet found bottom with this administration.  Still in free fall."
2020-05-11 01:11:51,"Reality flutters closer to him, then drifts further away. Somehow it never quite penetrates the density of Trump.
Disease, contagion, pandemic, mass death — these are just words — they trigger accompanying blurry images. If White House workers are contaminated, they’ll be removed and replaced. If any die, Trump will attempt to feign emotion when prompted.

Hoaxes and Witch Hunts are the greatest realities he recognizes.

Trump’s own death seldom crosses his mind. He assumes that his alien overlords have the power to protect his terrestrial body from their orbiting ship. His mission is the reason he exists. The only reason."

2020-05-11 01:13:10,"Stephen Miller, Pence, McEnany, et al, are getting tested DAILY while there are shortages of tests in high risk/high concentration zones? Why don't they simply engage in preventative behaviors and obviate the need for daily testing?

Or, just commingle. It's a Democratic hoax, after all. The numbers are inflated. Nothing to see here."
2020-05-11 01:13:20,"You never see any of the corona task force wearing a mask, I wonder if they have been told not too but you know who . Trump seems to believe it would scare Americans if they saw him wearing a mask. It’s just the opposite . Today my five year old niece diligently put on her face mask when she went out to ride her tricycle  she routinely tells me a mask protects me and protects her at the sane time , a very pragmatic young American.  If only our President has such capacity to care about others."
2020-05-11 01:13:51,"While I would be extremely concerned and worried if I worked at the WH now that an outbreak of COVID-19 has developed, on the other hand, with a president, his family, his vp and many members of his administration never adhering to the strong recommendations of wearing a face mask, gloves and practicing social distancing, why would any other outcome not be anticipated or expected?

When the president refuses to wear a face mask, especially when touring a factory that makes them but made sure he was wearing protective eye wear or when the vice president met with physicians at the Mayo clinic and while they wore face masks, he did not.

Such blatant disregard for wearing protecting gear and respecting social distancing was going to eventually result in this virus striking people who work at the WH.

I found Trump's reaction of being ""spooked that his valet had not been wearing a mask"" macabrely humorous. It's okay for him to ""reject guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to wear a mask when meeting with groups of people"" but it's not okay for his valet to not be wearing a mask.

As long as the president, his vp and other members of this administration continue to disregard the guidelines set forth by medical experts, then that tells me that this virus nor its impact is not viewed seriously by them.  ""It's someone else's problem but not mine because I'm not sick. . . ""

It's that kind of irresponsible attitude that is proving to be fatal to so many,"
2020-05-11 01:14:17,"From the story:
""Two senior administration officials said there were no plans to keep Mr. Trump and Mr. Pence apart because of a concern that they both could be incapacitated by Covid-19.""

I had assumed such a separation would be ""Governing 101"" akin to not flying the Pres and Veep on the same plane.

Not this administration. Better to put out a ""macho"" statement aligned with their overall downplaying of the crisis."
2020-05-11 01:15:53,"While I am sorry for those who were infected with the virus, not wearing masks and being in close proximity, in violation of the recommendations that have been given to all Americans, is in part to blame for this, and it does not seem right that the president and everyone close to him is tested every day, when there is a shortage of tests throughout the country. Our idiot in chief downplays this and says that tests aren't necessary.  But what can you expect from a president who takes no responsibility for anything and only cares about himself."
2020-05-11 01:15:39,"Don’t worry, Mike Race Bannon Pence is going to work, no mask, but he’ll social distance. Trump can’t wear a mask, it will contradict his lie that the virus threat is waning... Smart..."
2020-05-11 01:15:07,wow the white house staff and workers get daily tests but the average American is told to go back working on the line with no testing  or you get fired
2020-05-11 01:19:28,Those that do not take precautions against Covid are condemned to attract it.
2020-05-11 01:19:50,"Any normal person would be concerned about his staff members who have contracted a potentially deadly virus.

Trump is worried that their being sick might hurt HIS image politically.

That as much as anything sums up this sorry excuse for a human being."
2020-05-11 01:20:15,"The Administration has infected corporate America with the idea that businesses must ""return to work."" This is a mischaracterization for most office-centered workplaces. We never left work. In fact, we work more these days. For many of us, that extra hustle is ok, because it helps us to avoid the virus and has the added benefit of balancing our chaotic lives in a way that better suits our needs during this time. 

This fixation with ""returning to work"" in corporate America (really - returning to the office) will endanger communities for little to no value add. My office is chomping at the bit to congregate in closed spaces once again, and our business leaders are making decisions based on their quarantine fatigue rather than the severity of community spread. 

We need local leaders to articulate clearly in their reopening plans: ""If you are a business that can telework, you WILL telework until a vaccine is widely deployed."" 

It is our civic duty to do so, particularly for those businesses that cannot telework. Corporate America - do your part."
2020-05-11 01:20:31,"Now that the coronavirus has actually infected the West Wing of the White House,  perhaps anyone who thought that Donald Trump was not a class A imbecile will think again. He thought thatThis virus would disappear by having a cavalier attitude toward it . This has got to be as terminally stupid as anything we have ever seen in the history of our government leaders . Republicans are  understandably embarrassed, they have no choice but to shut up and watch as their commander-in-chief has now been hit a title too close for comfort with the very virus that he disregarded so carelessly in earlier months. While  nobody wishes anyone harm in this unprecedented pandemic , this might be the only way that our “very stable genius “ will finally learn a lesson that is long overdue."

2020-05-11 01:27:49,"Serves them right. Still they won't listen. The joint chiefs could be next as the navy representative is self quarantining because he was in contact with a family member who tested positive. But Trump met with senior military members and some cabinet officials, all mask less. After Sept. 11 the president and vice president were not at the same location for weeks. Trump Pence will continue to meet. That is dangerous. They could both come down with COVID. T is in his mid 70s and obese, P is 60. If the worst were to happen Nancy Pelosi would become president. 

Vanity is ruling. As is ego. During a health crisis neither should be in play. 

T is fretting that these White House cases are contradicting his mantra to open the government. He needs to listen to the scientists, the data, and his three sidelined experts who are all self quarantining, Fauci, Hahn, and Redfield."

When shot that awful night in June 1968, while still conscious, RFK asked if anyone else was hurt.  That's the difference between a great, courageous empathetic person, a hero, and the selfish, bullying incompetent coward now residing in the White House.

Yes, we do need to provide the highest levels of health and safety security for our President, but all of them, except Trump, accept it with some humility and even a little embarrassment.  I am reminded of a story of the Prince of Wales, Charles, who accidentally dropped an envelope into his waste-paper basket.  Rather than do what we all do, reach down and get it, he, instead, called someone to come and retrieve it for him. You lose respect for people who act like that.

Trump's biggest problem, imho, is his boorishness, his emotional immaturity, his vindictiveness, the constant changing of his mind, back, and back again.  What every single American needs right now, is a 'parent' more or less.  Someone to tell us that everything is going to be alright...that there is a light at the end of the tunnel.  We need a 'parent' in whom we have confidence...that they have our best interests at heart...that they Know What They Are Doing.  That they have a detailed plan, etc.  

I am certain that deep down, there are Trump supporters have now have serious doubts about him, and who may have felt this way for a while now.  Please consider whether you really want someone like this, continuing to lead our country, and continuing to ruin relationships with other countries."

The Ohio governor, Mike de Wine is Republican, and has tried to protect his citizens by a responsible lockdown. When gangs of armed sociopaths threatened journalists and state officials, he said, leave them alone, I’m the elected representative, I make the decisions, the buck stops here.

So it is possible for a Republican to be personally responsible, protect citizens, condemn extremists and still advocate conservative policies.

If you look at Trump or McConnell and can’t see that they are morally bankrupt, they you are probably morally bankrupt too.

My whole life the GOP has been lowering the bar, the candidate keep getting dumber, nastier and more venal. They can’t bring themselves to see America for what it is now and change with it, so they would rather drive the political system into the ground with voter suppression, minority government and now, overt hate.

Respirators are made of nonwoven fabric that’s enhanced with an electrostatic charge to trap particles that might otherwise penetrate its surface. The masks fit tightly around the nose and mouth and are intended to reduce the wearer’s exposure to particles smaller than 100 microns; a micron is one-millionth of a meter.
The pores in fabrics used to hinder dust mites and other allergens are around 3.5 microns to six microns—or 30 to 50 times as large as the virus—but smaller particles can still get caught in the fibers and be collected there, Dr. Pui said.
It’s important to note that the researchers tested only the materials—not masks made of the materials—so the findings don’t account for problems like air leaks caused by poor fit, and some of the items might not be breathable or pliable enough to use as face masks.

2020-05-11 03:26:02,"The data show that the greatest number of infections occur in places where people either live or work in proximity to scores of other people—prisons, meat-packing plants, nursing homes, cruise ships. Those numerous, cramped West Wing offices are the virus’s ideal stalking grounds. trump and his minions saw the same evidence we’ve all been seeing, yet didn’t practice physical distancing and thought mask-wearing was for wusses. Now the Masque of the Red Death has taken center stage at the White House, so other than that, mr. trump, how are you enjoying the reality play?"
2020-05-11 03:27:12,Apparently trump has no problem ordering meat packers back to work in close quarters. The hypocrisy is palpable.
2020-05-11 03:27:09,I'm glad that the uncaring white house now confronts the same issues as a meat processing plant. We're all in it together.
2020-05-11 03:28:49,Reopen only to buy more from China? Trade with China is suicide for peace and democracy and USA
2020-05-11 03:33:18,"Don't they understand that if they wait until someone tests positive, it is too late? It seems that both Trump and Pence believe they are invincible - that they don't need to take precautions. They may be in for a terrible reality check. 

(I do not think that either of them should be leading the country but I wouldn't wish this virus on anyone.)"
2020-05-11 03:33:21,"To quote Melania, ""I really don't care. Do u?"""
2020-05-11 03:33:25,"It's scary for me to read this: the White House is relying on a PCR test that turns up ""too many false negatives,"" meaning the test too often doesn't see the virus when it is there. 

Yesterday I read a paper in the Journal of the American Medical Association that described Taiwan's very successful diagnosis of covid 19  and the contact tracing that limited the secondary spread of this virus. This was in early January, when China was still not reporting all their cases and Trump was calling this novel virus a Democratic hoax. So Taiwan, among other countries, was successfully testing in January and wasn't fooled by China. And here we are, still struggling with testing in May.

It's worrisome that the White House is careless about social distancing until someone turns positive in their circle. They are assuming there is no virus shedding until the test registers positive. But who knows, with the unreliable test they use, how many viral particles are needed to register as positive. It may well be above the numbers needed to infect someone you work closely with on a daily basis. That's bad thinking.  I wonder if Fauci, Birx and the White House doctor know the questionable quality of tests their patients are using."
2020-05-11 03:34:06,What better confirmation of the aphorism that those who live by the sword die by the sword.
2020-05-11 03:34:21,"This needs to be said in a direct and simple way. America is in desperate need of a knowledgeable and capable leader in the White House, and until we get that, we're really sunk."
2020-05-11 03:34:49,"I read these comments and I cringe, lots of hate and rage. Never in my 69 years have I seen seen my country so divided and angry. I think maybe we are doomed, I don't know that we can agree on anything, a great country reduced to squabbling, bickering, and inaction. Reminds me of children who need supervision, yet there is nobody in charge."
2020-05-11 03:35:25,"I can only imagine they are scared because if Trump and Pence were both out of commission, Nancy Pelosi would become president.  The country should be so lucky.  Real, rational leadership!"
2020-05-11 03:36:26,"It's hard to imagine that in a middle of a worldwide pandemic, The President refuses to lead by example. He refuses to wear a mask and reportedly didn't want people at the WH to wear them if being seen by the media & public. In other words, bad photo op! But of course this mentality led to the foolish, ignorant move by Pence to refuse to wear a mask visiting the Mayo Clinic. And now there is this outbreak at the White House. 11 members of the Secret Service have tested positive & they were NOT showing symptoms. That's the whole point - its the asymptomatic who are out in public spreading it. Wear a mask!"
2020-05-11 03:39:22,"When Trump looks at someone standing in front of him, he sees someone, who he knows has been tested. Not so much for the rest of us."
2020-05-11 03:39:22,"""Acting President Pelosi""
 ...  has a nice ring to it."
2020-05-11 03:39:24,"""the president was spooked that his valet, who is among those who serve him food, had not been wearing a mask.""

Spooked that his valet wasn't wearing a mask?  Gee, I wonder who in the White House has the power to order people to wear masks."
2020-05-11 03:39:30,President Pelosi. I like the sound of it.
2020-05-11 03:43:43,"For a virus that's going to go away by itself, and many believe to be a hoax, these folks are really worried beyond what's rational for an illness the left is just using as a political weapon.

Or maybe it's real after all?"
2020-05-11 03:48:20,Hmmmmm.....now let’s see. trump and pence getting tested daily....that’s 730 tests a year wasted. I’m not even able to find one single test for my 90 year old mother.
2020-05-11 03:50:27,Suddenly this virus is a big deal in the White House.  Who woulda thought?
2020-05-11 03:52:10,"Dear WH aides and staff,
This is not a president or administration worthy of your service. Run out of there now to save your lives, and there are much better uses for your time and skills that do involve selling your soul."
2020-05-11 03:54:03,I guess what goes around comes around.
2020-05-11 03:54:29,A mask is not a miracle nor a cure. If you spend hours in close quarters with someone infected you will get it pretty quickly.
2020-05-11 03:55:59,"Scared to go to work at the White House?  What do they think it's like going to work in a meat packing plant, or worse yet, an emergency room?  At least at the White House they get tested and have access to PPE.  That's more than can be said of 99% of the rest of the country's workers.  My little violin is playing for them..."
2020-05-11 03:57:26,"And yet they are perfectly happy for the rest of us to go back to work. My partner has been called back to work in a restaurant. Where the customers will not be wearing masks. A restaurant that does not offer health insurance to its employees, pays them $2.50 an hour, and expects them to pool tips. They are expected to go in and risk their lives and the lives of their loved ones for $2.50 plus tips, serving food to idiots who don’t have any respect for their own health or the health of those around them. He has no choice. It’s either go in, or lose his job altogether and be disqualified from receiving unemployment. All this because Republicans don’t want to pay people unemployment benefits so that they can stay home and not become a pandemic statistic. I have no sympathy for anyone at the White House. At least they are paid decent salaries and have access to excellent healthcare."
2020-05-11 03:57:41,"What is scary is that Kevin Hassett's projections about the course of this pandemic were somehow given any credence when those projections done by experts have been increasingly disregarded.  And the disregard for basic CDC guidelines for social distancing have obviously been continuously disregarded at the White House.  As you sow, so shall you reap."
2020-05-11 03:59:07,"Trump was a germophobe long before this pandemic.  A valet who serves him food testing positive for the virus has to be a nightmare made real.

Life is nothing if not ironic."
2020-05-11 03:59:05,"The hypocrisy is terribly sad and infuriating. How dare these privileged people shake in their shoes while they demand that the less privileged risk their lives. This is a disease, not a war- and the elderly, meat production workers and prisoners are not soldiers. Rather they and we are victims of greed and ignorance."
2020-05-11 06:19:53,"I am an American living in Germany, and I am so sorry to read about all that is happening in the U.S. None of us are immune. I don't understand why the White House would not be more careful. This will surely spread if they were not wearing masks, everyone was coming to work, commuting, going about their lives as usual. Congress should also be tested regularly; more cases will surely arise. It only takes one case in a small working area with people ignoring all guidelines. The White House is no exception."
2020-05-11 04:16:18,"With every new day I am learning to despise my wife's BFF and her younger brother more and more for voting for the Trumpster.  Everyday.   
We have had several family ZOOM sessions since we are scattered, Brussels, Brooklyn, Pasadena, Atlanta, Calgary for birthdays, a holiday and I am unable to look at him on the screen.  The BFF, we don't talk about - period.  We will all get through this, we are lucky, and I thought things were strained before this nightmare."
2020-05-11 04:50:26,I have spent 200 hours on a Covid-19 wing in a Bronx hospital these past five weeks. I have not been infected with the new coronavirus. I know this because I took the antibody test a couple of days ago. My co-workers and I wear our N95 respirators religiously; we disinfect our work stations twice a day; and we wash our hands hourly. These basic precautions truly prevent the spread of this virus.
2020-05-11 05:02:38,Time is on the side of the virus which is not in a hurry and will spread slow and steady even with mitigation steps taken. Why would anyone think the white house staff are somehow an exception and not likely to be infected? Many of them seemed not wearing masks and working in close proximity to each other. Let us hope the medical experts like Dr. Fauci and others are ok and everyone learns a lesson not to follow the poor leader as an example.
2020-05-11 04:34:13,"The fact that wearing masks is the safest thing to do has not been a secret. My grocery store has been having all customers and all workers wearing masks for the last 7 weeks. As far as the virus goes, the 
white House is no different then my grocery store. But Trump thought masks made him look scared. So his staff has been working in a needlessly unsafe working situation. All because of President Trump's vanity"
2020-05-11 05:08:29,"My brother helped my cousin get up from a chair and to the bathroom on Sunday March 15th. I spent the day on tuesday riding around and working with my brother. My cousin went into the hospital on Monday and tested positive for covid19 on Wednesday. He died a few days later. I thought I should be tested and requested testing. Well of course i couldn't get a test and never did,  putting the lie to trumps claim. No one from the hospital followed up or even showed any interest. But like trump says "" one day you test negative then you test positive so what's the point of testing?"" Can we survive until trump is gone?"
2020-05-11 07:05:18,"I told my sister and her wife to reconsider a trip here, as we have 10,000+ cases. They live in Boise, and said, ""It was like Georgia here in Walmart."" They used to live in GA.

Everyone going mental and acting like no problem.

People are good in my extremely right-wing town. Not as many masks as I would like to see, but politely standing six feet behind."
2020-05-11 06:21:08,"I read a suspense story similar to this recently, called ""The Masque of the Red Death"" by a Edgar Allen Poe. It was exciting, but it didn't end well!"
2020-05-11 07:37:01,"Is the Senator correct?

Senator Toomey, Republican of Pennsylvania, is a strong advocate of ""reopening."" Among many other claims, he insists that Pennsylvania hospitals, collectively, have 5,500 beds but only 40 coronavirus patients. I understand most COVID-19 patients stay home, and that hospitalization rates are dropping. But I didn't think the percentage was THAT low. Pennsylvania is one of the ""top"" states for COVID-19 infection. 

Is Toomey correct?  Hard to imagine, since not overwhelming hospitals if one of the key tests of a state's readiness to ""reopen."""
2020-05-11 05:56:45,"Kevin Hassett also said on “Face the Nation”  “But, you know, it’s the time when people have to step up and serve their country.  And if I think about the amazing accomplishments of the team that we put together that’s been down in the basement of the White House getting data from all over the government to help us decide how to solve the ventilator problem and the PPE problem and everything.  But I think that everybody knows that they go into work.  You’ve been in the West Wing.  You know.  It’s a - it’s a small crowded place.  It’s, you know, it’s a little bit risky.  But-but you have to do it because you have to serve your country.   Margaret Brennan also asked Kevin Hassett if he wore a mask and he replied that he had a mask right there and he practiced social distancing.  I thought it was important to add the additional remarks made on “Face the Nation.”  I happened to watch it.  

I took away from this segment that people have to do their jobs but they must do it safely and with caution.  It is possible that in private President Trump and Mike Pence wear masks.  I think that if they were seen in public, they would be mocked and criticized.  Maybe they should now wear masks and not give a darn what the critics think.  They will be criticized no matter what they do.  This will never change."
2020-05-11 06:18:55,"Do they think wearing a flag lapel pin would miraculously prevent the virus from entering the White House?  Or think you could just build a wall around it?
Don’t want to make light of the individuals who tested positive, but welcome to the real America 45! Buying groceries, staying apart from others, making hand sanitizer, pumping gas, can’t visit our elderly parents; just a few examples of the real life fears we’ve been experiencing since early March.  Some of this could have been prevented or lessened     No sympathies from me."

2020-05-11 06:34:26,"How richly ironic that the White House staff should test positive for the corona virus.  Perhaps this will launch a new sense of urgency to deal with the pandemic.  Or, simply sideline temporarily or permanently those who would obstruct measures to deal with the disease.  Perhaps the best outcome is a complete quarantine and isolation of the White House for the duration of the pandemic."
2020-05-11 05:40:13,"Whatever will still happen, and unfortunately many more unpleasant thing might still happen, this presidency will be remembered for its non-presiding over the covid-19 pandemic. If now the White House gets hit by the pandemic like a poorely run business, then the event will give future generations an  icon of this presidency's non-presiding over the covid-19 pandemic. The further likely icons of this presidency  are depressing: Bunches of angry recriminating tweets, self-serving  justifications while in the country  people loose their jobs in a manner never seen since the Great Depression and  numbers of deaths like never before in this country, especially among the elderly, veterans, and medical staff."
2020-05-11 07:47:19,"Leaders of the world's nations are being forced to decide a difficult question ""Your Life or Your Livelyhood"" ? I'm not the first writer to use those exact words but they are succinct and get down to the real question.

A vaccine to end this pandemic seems to be a year and a half  or  two years away and even that does not come with a written guarantee.

Most states and federal government have now  decided to return to work knowing that will increase the number of deaths.
The last time we were faced with such a decision was 
December 1941, Seventy Nine years ago.

Many soldiers died but we won the battle then returned to peace.
Once again many ""soldiers"" are dying and we are searching for peace.
Our health care system will find it in the form of a vaccine this time.
As in war, our job is to hold on tight, do the best we can until ""peace"" arrives.
This is not the first time that people of the world had to wait for  ""peace""
There's a pretty good chance that  our own country, with all of its faults, will be first to deliver the vaccine to bring the peace.
Sadly, after that, the same old arguments  between our two political parties will start up all over again.

It would be nice if we discover a vaccine to eliminate that.

2020-05-11 05:06:20,"Again, Trump is handed an opportunity to become a leader.  Instead of encouraging battles in our streets over liberating America, he can say this is real and it attacks everybody.  And it's still not too late to step back and let the scientists map out a strategy.

as the news continues to come out about the trump admins complete rejection of any and all possible aids to containing the virus, the masks, the agency group-various, shut down, the personnel muzzled, it becomes clearer and clearer, that  these people are in fact criminally negligent in the extreme.

you can not fail so totally and claim incompetence, though of course it would seem a good excuse in his case. At a certain point a person can get a sense of the big picture. that picture is a highly ''scary one'' that picture says that there is something totally and completely wrong about the conduct of the administration, due to ? 

his desperate need to get re-elected lest he face the music at long last for all that he has done? done since well before he became elected?

 very likely we have a man who is so deep in the very worst abuses of our democracy that he is literally willing to do anything to enable him to hold onto  power.

If this means many more tens of thousands of people are going to die and the economy is going to be even more seriously damaged than it has been -then so be it.

One would think that the poetic justice has only just begun. Many in red America are going to pay a heavy price for believing him."

2020-05-11 04:29:30,"Trump is preoccupied with appearances to the point of ridiculousness. He does not need to act like the virus would not dare to offend him by infecting him. But his belief that that was expected of him by his base has produced open pathways for the virus to spread into his working environment. 

The tests produce lagging results of their reliability is high and some significant risks of false results if they produce quick results. In any case, the tests on him don’t prevent him from becoming infected. 

Trump is placing risky bets and is vulnerable to getting infected despite the daily testing by interacting with others so frequently. 

By not wearing a mask when in gatherings, he is validating the assertions from the right that the pandemic is a fake one and so no precautions are justified."

I think that before a candidate gets to run for office or work for an Administration, copious testing in terms of comprehension of the Constitution, science, cultural shibboleths and up dated psychiatric evaluations should be mandated. This Administration may score in the lower percentile and  it may reform education as well—nothing like a win/win for the world.

One of his employees was diagnosed with COVID-19 because she did not wear a mask, and could have infected many other people. He should be focusing on the nations overall health. We should all be wearing masks and constantly taking precautions. Trump just wants to start everything back up, and act like this virus isn’t even a big deal, when it obviously is.

2020-05-11 05:21:26,"Trump and Pence's claims that they are ok not wearing masks and not social distancing because they are tested every day is illogical. That is like someone who engages in unsafe unprotected sex on a regular basis claiming that they are ok because they get tested after every act. 
This clearly shows arrogance (i.e. they are invulnerable) in that they should get tests every day while health care workers and other vulnerable people can not get any tests."
2020-05-11 04:32:10,"Trump specializes in hubris — (in Greek tragedy) excessive pride toward or defiance of the gods, leading to nemesis. As we say, ""Pride comes before a fall."" His reckless abandonment of basic safety measures is meant, I suppose, to downplay the risks and prove himself a tough guy, as if he would brave the working conditions of a meat plant without complaint or rush into a high school to confront a shooter armed with an assault rifle. In reality (not TV), he is a blowhard, and no amount of bluster will protect him in the end when the American people bring him the fate he deserves in November."

To stay or leave and lo, they remain. Even now. 
How does one come to such an agreement?"

Americans should now feel more fearful than ever before, ... and why do you all not constantly ask, why ??  Why does Donald want all Americans to be his 'Warriors', and go back to work in such unknown times.  
It is because he has only ever been in the Presidency for his own needs, .. and sadly, never yours."

Empathizing well requires a strong self and a sensitivity to the differentness and sameness of another  It requires a clear sense of where I end and others begin. It calls for good boundaries.  President Trump's boundaries are inflexible and therefore it is impossible for him to try on another person's experience and see how it feels."

That quick test needs to be produced in the millions...starting two months ago. When is someone at the national level - please not Jared K - going to make this happen?"
2020-05-11 09:41:05,"Trump's excuse: Meeting heads of foreign sates, world leaders, dictators.
Biggest question is how he meets that is considered a dictator? #2 is when did he last host a foreign leader, they are holding up distancing protocols and have cut traveling. The only reason Trump travels in country is you cannot hold a campaign rally over the phone and that is the is only reason he travels. Mask factory and Old Veterans - camera candy."

Casting might include a traitor working at a secret CIA bioweapons lab and a despised, hated step-sister working at the White House.  The point to the movie would be this White House us underwater regarding infectious disease and evil intent. This operation needs more testing capability than the Abbott machine.  The story reveals that work conditions are similar to crampted conditions of a cruise ship instead of modern office space.  They need to setup circus tents for workers and give these people more breathing room or else a White House in need of decontamination."
2020-05-11 09:52:00,"Over 77,000 Americans have been killed by this virus in roughly 125 days. Yet, the top-down conspiracy theories continue to be fed. And the virus not so subtly mocked, such as by the VP’s mask-less hospital tour, and the President’s entourage playing “Live and Let Die” as he toured, without  a mask, a mask manufacturing plant. Perhaps a song titled e.g. “Let Die” might have been better reflected the messaging."
2020-05-11 10:01:37,"I run cognitive behavioral groups for men convicted of domestic violence crimes. Many of my clients are like the president: they have an unhealthy need for power and control in their relationships with others.

2020-05-11 10:08:43,"While Mr. Trump leans on a test that seems not to work as well as it should he insists the rest of us get back to work and we don't even have an ability to test nearly as good as his faulty one. I appreciate that he is bravely leading the way into danger, but I'm not eager to follow this strange example of reckless confidence and heedless stupidity. When I see the efficient testing, tracing, and subsequent reopening of S. Korea I can't help but think that that used to be us. That 20 years ago if this happened we'd be sending doctors out to hotspots to show the world how it's done. Now we are the hotspot, we are the failed state. What a nightmare our leadership has been!"

So I'm curious as to the accuracy of these tests.  The accuracy of the testing goes down if viral transport media is used.  So has the White House acquired this machine or are tests done at a different location?  Many questions remain as to how safe White House personnel really are."
2020-05-11 11:17:53,"There are no plans to keep Trump and Pence at any distance from one another - so, if they both were to become incapacitated due in part to their own stubborn resistance to safety protocols around Covid19...  we'd get..  the Speaker of the House in charge!

2020-05-11 12:17:59,"I don't wish ill health on anyone though matter how much I detest their politics and behavior.  But it's so ironic.

2020-05-11 12:27:25,"Went to Lowes the other day. Had to darnit.
Saw that 80-90% of the men there were not wearing a mask and had never heard of ""social distancing."" Standing in small groups, shaking hands, patting one another on the back. 
Got out of there quickly.
I guess they think that mask wearing is against there personal rights and the freedom granted by the Constitution. 
OK, how do they feel about the restaurant signs which state ""No shirt, no shoes, no service.""
 Do they enter without a shirt? without shoes ?
I have to think that they do not care about their health and that of their friends and family.  And that of their fellow shoppers.
Those wearing masks do care."

2020-05-11 12:58:58,"Incredible that the White House and Trump have had such a cavalier attitude towards observing social distancing and wearing masks. Any test, reliable or not, will only tell you whether or not you have the virus - it's not going to protect you from getting it, which is why daily testing of Trump and Pence is a waste of money. 

We also cannot help noticing that the King and his Footmen get tested all the time while the rest of us have to already be sick to get a test."
2020-05-11 13:06:54,"God sure does have a great sense of humor—and exquisite timing. Set Trump up beautifully for three years—and then took him down with a punishing, earthshaking blow.

2020-05-11 13:23:19,"Outbreak at the White House and the alleged President and VP are not masquerading around with masks or masquerading around leading.  With now over 75,000 people dead in the US, and the town has over 600 cases on the local town level, we want to know why in the Town of Yorktown, NY the GOP Town Supervisor and his minions on the town board ignore daily how incompetent the head of their party is and never condemned the horrible, incoherent remarks of Trump or is twitter policies.  The Trump propaganda continues on their local websites, social media but in public GOP won't utter his name in pubic."
2020-05-11 13:40:16,"There is no leadership from the White House because there is no leader in the White House. Trump and his band of incompetents have no clue as what is leadership. Looking at the basic characteristics of a good leader:
Communication.
Integrity.
Accountability.
Empathy.
Humility.
Resilience.
Vision.
Influence.
Positivity.
Delegation.
Confidence.
we find that bobbleheads  in charge of the government are totally lacking in these basic necessities. Especially prominent is the total absence of humility, empathy, integrity and accountability. A brand new Marine second lieutenant has more leadership skills than these fools at the White House."

2020-05-11 13:45:11,"What am I missing? “Quarantining” Fauci and others looks more like information suppression than a valid health strategy. 

The White House has testing capacity. They don’t need to quarantine people for 14 days to determine if they develop symptoms. They can test them daily, and if tests are negative, they are fine. 

If goal is to prevent Fauci and others from getting infected, then the 14 days make no sense. You would need to isolate them until WH was confident there was no risk of infection. So either the reporting is wrong, and they are not “quarantining” for “14 days” or this is part of Trump’s strategy to limit access to Fauci and other health experts. 

It is curious that just these 3 people are isolating- but not Pence. Testing Pence daily does not keep him from getting infected. Do people in WH realize that?"
2020-05-11 13:46:44,What a shame. The Trump sweethearts have to finally deal with the fear that All the world has to deal with. Their little bubble of invulnerability has finally been burst. Boo Hoo. Now Trump and company have to come to grips with what they nonchalantly are telling Americans. Be Warriors?! Some warrior; I hear Trump is freaked out and whining like a baby about not receiving enough protection. Add total hypocrisy to the endless list of failings in a man who has completely and totally failed to do what needs to be done in occupying the White House. For 3 years he did not face any real adversity; except that which he created himself. Finally the Big Test came. And of course he has totally Flunked the test. The moment is too big for Trump. Trump is Too Small for the Moment!
2020-05-11 13:51:20,"If we have learned ANYTHING from the disaster that is the Trump administration is that you cannot trust information released by the White House as being accurate. Maybe two staffers tested positive, but maybe the real number is twenty or thirty? We may never know the real numbers for the same reason many other facts and statistics are routinely suppressed - to massage Trump's fragile little ego at the cost of American lives."
2020-05-11 13:59:15,"He’s “annoyed” with Katie Miller a close member of the WH staff. What? How about wishing her to get well soon?

That said, any outbreak in the WH will never be fully revealed to the public."

2020-05-11 14:51:46,It amazes me that anyone could be surprised that the political climbers in this White House (not the career fed employees) are emulating this disgraceful president and his behavior. How can they be so fearful of this guy when in less than a year he will be gone. Real courage would be to stand in front of him and call him out.
2020-05-11 14:05:58,"Do I understand this correctly?  People in the White House and the Executive Office Building were not following the 6-foot social distancing and face mask advice of the CDC?

2020-05-11 15:03:05,"It’s all a show of courage for his base until it isn’t. It’s easy to put on a reality show of arrogance, do as I say not as I do, until the virus gets too close. Even with daily testing the west wing wasn’t spared the infection. I believe they’re scared. The rest of us are too. Suddenly the masks are on, people are working from home, greater measures will be implemented at the WH. The reality show has become real."
2020-05-11 14:14:38,"I predict a cover up will follow shortly. There are bound to be more cases in the White House. The public simply won't hear about them. From the administration's perspective, the problem isn't a lapse in safety. The problem is the public was informed the White House is unsafe. Anyone else who tests positive will be quietly side-lined under some pretext or another. Do you really believe President Trump would tell you he tested positive if he tested positive?

No. The White House is trying extremely hard to take this news to ground. Going to work might get you killed. Telling the press will certainly get you fired though. That's the threat."
2020-05-11 14:47:20,"I find it very amusing how they all maintain the fiction that Trump or Pence being incapacitated would somehow be a terrible blow to American governance.

But I wonder ... according to CDC data, just 426 tests were performed across the entire United States in the five weeks after the first US case was notified on Jan 20. 

So if Trump and Pence are getting tested every day, and those in close contact with them, etc ... how many of those 426 tests actually took place outside the White House?"

2020-05-11 15:33:01,"It would be beyond ironic if Donald Trump and Mike Pence come down with COVID-19 considering how cavalier they both have been about taking the very precautions they preach to the rest of the country.

Mr. Trump will wear protective glasses when he visits a mask factory, but no mask.  Go figure.

I could only smile when he said to the media the other day that Katie Miller tested negative just the day before she apparently contracted COVID-19.  Maybe Drs. Fauci or Birx can explain to the president that this is how it usually works.  A person is not infected, until they get infected. . .

That's what taking precautions are all about."

2020-05-11 15:46:00,"It is a strange symptom of the political divisions in our country, that whether or not you wear a mask and observe health and social distance guidelines is a statement of party affiliation. It is tragic and frustrating when you live in a place like Colorado Springs, and half your town is proud to be crowding spaces without any protection, including a number of elderly folks. 

People have a right to free speech, but not to free spittle! Keep your germs and your politics to yourselves."

2020-05-11 15:29:11,"“At the White House, all employees are being tested at least weekly, officials said, and a handful of top aides who regularly interact with the president are being tested daily.” But what about the president himself? How often is he tested? Don't we have a right to know?

The report also says that he is getting irritated with people who get too close to him. Unfortunately, the position he holds is such that many people have to interact with him closely in the course of their work. At a very mundane level, can he function without the services of valets and chauffeurs? 

And one of the two people who have been tested positive is his valet. The other one is Katie Miller, the spokeswoman for Vice President Mike Pence. She was a regular fixture at the president's now-discontinued press briefings on the coronavirus. How can the president’s getting irritated with such people coming close to him be justified? Also not justified in being concerned standing near a man who has adamantly refused to follow the most basic of the guidelines set by the CDC? I am referring to the one that instructed people to wear a mask while interacting closely with others. 

One lesson Mr. Trump can learn from this this crisis is that a pandemic does not discriminate. The most powerful person in the world and the lowly migrant workers who sleep on the streets of Indian cities, because the outbreak of the virus has rendered them jobless, are equally susceptible to it. The coronavirus is a great leveler."

It seems to me that the White House early on should have admonished staffers to practice the recommended social distancing and personal hygiene when they go out into the community after work. Clearly one or more of them was infected outside and brought the infection into the White House."

Masks primary purpose is not protecting yourself, it's protecting the people around you just in case you're asymptomatic or not showing symptoms yet.  It's not about being scared, it's about common sense and common courtesy.  But if the boss won't follow protocol no one else is going to take seriously either.

""False Negatives in Quick COVID-19 Test Near 15 Percent: Study""
Abbott’s ID NOW test missed the most positive samples among five products given the green light by the FDA to use during the pandemic.

The ID NOW machine was granted emergency use approval during the pandemic on March 27 and generated buzz after President Donald Trump unveiled it during a press conference. In Procop’s analysis, Abbott’s test had a false-negative rate of 14.8 percent. 

“So that means if you had 100 patients that were positive, 15 percent of those patients would be falsely called negative. They’d be told that they’re negative for COVID when they’re really positive. That’s not too good,” Procop tells NPR, adding that, ideally, test reliability should be above 95 percent."
2020-05-11 16:29:58,"This is proof positive that testing is a farce.  No one can test more than the white house.  You want science, here is what science says. 
1- The current quarantine is not effective.  Absent a vaccine the number of people that will be infected is a constant, it is only a matter of rate of infection, and who gets infected first.  
2- Give the country a week to stock up on food
3- No one leaves home for 10 days.  
4- After that, if you are over 60 you remain quarantined.  
5- Everyone under 60 please go party so that we build the necessary herd immunity, while the hospitals are able to manage.
6- 2 weeks later open up everything.

I suppose the CDC has been wrong on just about every estimate  Finally, doctors are not economists.   If they understood economics the US would not be spending half of its medical expenses on people in the last month of their lives.    They really bring one perspective to opening up, but if we followed the CDC advice, we will NEVER EVER open, because there will not be a vaccine any time soon."

Why don't you tell that to the health care workers, the personal heath aides who care for the elderly and the disabled in their homes? They go to work because they make so little money, they have no choice.

Scary to go to work- you have the option to work from home, you have a dependable source of income, you have health insurance, you have food on the table, your family will survive.

Scary to go to work? Do you want our empathy, our sympathy, our acknowledgement that because you and others in the West Wing are arrogant and flout the guidelines (You don't need to wear a mask) - that we should do what?

All non-violent, lesser crimes inmates have been released.

Well intentioned as they may be, in the absence of centralized, effective leadership. their efforts are disparate and often conflicting, 

Worse, is that while this so called 'fearless' leader is 'spooked' and cowering behind his desk in order to save his own skin, he's still willing to risk the lives of others in order to salvage his now ravaged economy and looming election.

2020-05-08 18:17:04,"A brief, unofficial primer on respiratory protection from an old retired OSHA fart:

The primary purpose of a surgical mask is to shield the patient from exposure from the doctor or nurse, not to reduce the exposure for the wearer. They are not designed to protect the 
health care provider because the surrounding  air easily passes around the mask  and is inhaled by the wearer. 

Respirators, unlike masks, are intended  to protect the wearer from inhaling harmful agents in the surrounding air.  Optimal protection for the wearer depends upon the quality of the filter media and the tightness of the fit around the face of the wearer.  The best filter media has high filter efficiency and is easy to breathe through. The filter media used in a N95 NIOSH certified respirators remove 95% or greater of particles in the size range of the covid-19 virus with minimal pressure drop across the filter media.  Low pressure drop is very important, because it means the wearer is able to easily breathe while wearing the respirator and less leakage occurs between the face and the respirator.  The protection  provided by a respirator is largely negated if the respirator does not effectively  seal  around the  face and nose, because most of the inhaled air takes the path of least resistance through these gaps resulting in minimal protection.   Facial hair prevents a good respirator seal.  Even one day growth can result in leakage and reduced protection."

2020-05-11 13:25:42,"Just like Governor Cuomo's New York, Governor Murphy's New Jersey requires covid-19-diagnosed patients to be returned from the superior care a hospital can give these victims to the sealed environment of facilities like these veterans' homes. It is Governor Murphy's failure to act to reverse this edict and  Attorney General Grewal's aiding and abetting and excusing him that should be investigated, not the valiant care of the overworked and overwhelmed staff at those homes."
2020-05-11 14:02:12,"If you think the vulture capitalists who work for the old money plutocrats in this country care one whit about or fellow Americans regardless of their service to this nation, you don't understand how corrupt humans are capable of being; how evil they are able to become.

To end this horrible evil that allows this to happen, we will need fresh leadership base who are founded in the moral imperative to love one another and at a minimum to treat every person with respect.

We could have already solved the problem of nation wide testing of everyone using saliva based COVID-19 testing for rapid response.  It is unthinkable that we can not even do so at the doorstep of every nursing home and every veteran's center.

The White House is in such a bungled mess of incoherence that they can't even deploy reliable rapid testing but instead are keeping their corporate fealty with unreliable Avid machines rather than selecting the most reliable and rapid testing systems.

They have decided that no leadeership is required.  And ""you governors figure it out yourself.""  Well, in Southern States ""figuring it out for Veterans and Black folks"" appears to be just letting them die off so their won't be as many to vote in the election from what I'm observing.

This article is sickening and shows that this administration and the GOP care nothing for doing the right thing to save Americans and open America back up.  That's my informed opinion.   Sickening."

His doctor prescribed mood altering medications that kept Dad dopey at best, and mostly incoherent.  Often he stank, as did his room and even his face had food stains!  His life savings was charged an enormous amount per month, his veterans and social security charged out as well, and the ""protective services"" that collected fees to provide for his needs took all of his money, legally of course.  Then, Dad was moved into a room with another individual, contracted pneumonia within a month of his penury, and died.  No amount of pleading with doctors, lawyers, judges or family helped during the two years!

Though Alaska has the fewest cases of Covid-19 of any state, they locked that place down from the very beginning; no visitors whatsoever.  That's what needed to be done at all similar long term care and retirement facilities.  It's tough for family not to be able to visit but I wholeheartedly agree it what needed to be done.   I've not seen my mom for over two months now,  She has advanced dementia so can't talk on the phone tho did visit her through the window yesterday for Mother's Day.

I never understood, until now, why he was so insistent on not ""being put in a home"" until now. He knew all too well, even back in the early 90s, how people were treated. 

What is even more frightening is how there was talk on the campaign trail of government provided day care for children. I would never let my children attend a daycare run by the same people who treat the most vulnerable of our society this way. Thankfully Bernie stepped down."
2020-05-11 23:36:37,"State veterans homes are a strange animal. They typically charge the veterans 1/3 of their income and have asset limits. Like housing for the elderly. Theses places are for poor veterans. Elderly housing is for the poor elderly folks. We need to be honest. Nursing homes are funded by Medicaid (welfare) for most patients. Some states have 85% of all residents paid for by welfare. Poor, welfare, old people with no choice. And they get lousy care. Shocking!!!"
2020-05-12 01:02:33,"The initial responses to the coronavirus in these retirement homes for military personnel, their spouses, and their immediate families, was a cautious one. Even as time went on, the proper level of alarm didn't start to ring in people's heads until the first wave of group deaths in a single home had occurred. By then, it was almost too late. If blame for this can be delivered to anyone's door, it would have to be Don Trump's: his false confidence in the pandemic never getting a foot hold here; his false bravado that he understood the science as well or better then the doctors (shades of his understanding ISIS better than the generals); the near burlesque-like side show he put on early on (how the numbers were going to zero, how people were going to their jobs and getting better without missing any work days, how COVID-19 was nothing more than the flu in a new form). These all demonstrated the INCREDIBLY CASUAL WAY that Don Trump reacted to this true danger. People were lulled, even hypnotized, into believing that any other reaction was an over-reaction. These deaths could have been prevented if only somehow, someone could have gotten Don Trump, for once in his life, to be serious about something instead of casual. But that was not to be. So as we, as a nation, prepare ourselves to endure the loss of 50,000 more of our fellow citizens by this August or sooner, we must learn to accept the fact that leadership by the casual inevitably leaves death and needless ruin in its wake."

My father in law paid $9,000 per month in assisted living and my mother in law paid $14,000 per month in memory care.  It’s not the revenue stream it’s the way they financially structure these businesses where they drain the revenues through inter company charges.  

It is despicable the way these homes short shrift care to increase profits.  The most vulnerable among us are barely cared for so owner can reap millions - we need standards , oversight and fines - along with the elimination of arbitration for families."

2020-05-07 18:16:03,"Part of the business model is to hire part time workers (each with  enormous numbers of residents to care for) to avoid the cost of benefits. Workers then need jobs at several nursing homes to make a barely adequate salary. Those same poorly paid and so important caregivers then spread COVID 19 to multiple facilities and their residents. 
The for profit care of elderly and dependent persons in the USA is criminal."
2020-05-07 18:19:07,"I've been around nursing homes for much of my professional career (30 + years). The CNA's, LPN's and RN's who work there are amazing. They do back breaking work for very low pay. They are understaffed and over-burdened and do their best to provide quality care for your loved ones. The inside of the nursing homes vary dramatically from those at the bottom funded by Medicaid and Medicare (bare bones and often filthy), and those who pay in excess of $10,000 a month (very often decadent). In this country's nursing homes, you truly get what you pay for."

Splitting up management from who owns the real estate, and of course those ""consulting"" companies, guarantees those left with the unpleasant job of actually running these homes bears the brunt of lawsuits, and they further cut staffing.
I don't think most facilities should be sued for the covid-19 deaths, but each state needs to redesign how it inspects, and licenses, each/every facility. As many will say, how businesses, and the governments, both federal and state, allow for such substandard facilities to continue, especially those with one or two stars (both considered poor quality), reveals how little we care about eldercare. 
The punishment? Put the owners who reap heavy profits, incognito, into their own facilities, when they are old and frail. In the meantime, it's way past due to overhaul the entire system."

If the super-Katrina storm of coronavirus has a silver lining, it's the glaring spotlight it's shining on the numerous longstanding failures of the world's only capitalist health care. We can only hope the catastrophe will ultimately catalyze the repeal and replacement of our for-profit medical industry with a true health care system like the rest of the world. 

Just as Republicans and the corporate interests they exclusively represent think nothing of sacrificing millions of expendable people so those interests can resume their entitled acquisition of the nation's wealth, I have no problem with the executives and investors in our medical-industrial complex sacrificing their spectacular wealth for the good of everyone, and being reduced to merely rich."

I don't care if you are a Republican or a Democrat...this is unacceptable and we must push-back by contacting our Representatives because the real virus that harms and kills more annually in this country is unmitigated greed & an ugly form of Capitalism that is not entrepreneurial but exploitational.
Please do not assume that Democrats are opposed to said legislation because I've heard that some are'receptive' to the idea of insulating their rich donors from prosecution for clear negligence and gross harm. We can't allow it - we have to have an occasional victory for all of us. This is wrong."
2020-05-07 18:32:35,This seems like a segment I should have been investing in.
2020-05-07 18:53:45,"This is a moral issue, not a financial or health matter. It has to do with the underlying ability of private equity to control the wellbeing of our families. These are our elderly we’re talking about. Do these people not have grandparents?"
2020-05-07 18:53:50,"The whole premise of ""private equity"" comes from right-wing insistence, ever since Ronald Reagan, that ""free markets"" are better at everything than other arrangements, such as government operation or non-profit organizations. 

And the record of the past 30 years makes it manifestly clear that market fundamentalism and the claim that all we need to thrive is to deregulate everything is nothing but pure fraud!

Indeed, everything we know shows that ""private equity"" is as if designed to bring outirresponsibility, manipulation and gaming of social rules and expectations in the individuals in charge. To put it simply, allowing the kind of 'private equity' the United States has today either encourages managers and investors to do evil, or gives free rein to those most evil already. 

Our institutions and rules make a difference. If carefully designed, they can encourage entrepreneurship that benefits all, while benefiting ethical entrepreneurs a lot. I'm OK with that. But if our institutions and rules are wrong and corrupt, they encourage behavior that damages the community while grotesquely rewarding an evil few. We can stop that... but we have to recognize the problem and we have to act now. VOTE IN NOVEMBER!"
2020-05-07 18:54:49,"So much rot comes from creative financing - most of which can be traced back to what our captains of industry and finance learn in business schools in this country.

People with MBAs should have to be licensed like most other professionals, such as lawyers, doctors and teachers. They need to be held accountable to a code of ethics that recognizes society or community as a stakeholder in business, and when they run afoul of those ethics, they need to lose their license. 

Private equity is an unchecked cancer in our capitalist society which is now run by a purchased government."
2020-05-07 19:03:39,"Any person working in the assisted living or skilled nursing arena could have pointed out this trend a decade ago. Small local not-for-profit communities purchased by for profit chains. First thing they did, raise daily charges to residents, downgrade positions, and cut staff."
2020-05-07 19:04:42,"I made over 2,000 visits to nursing homes from 1995-2002, over 95% were to For-Profit nursing homes. It was an endless struggle to get proper care for residents. Under-staffing was a plague which never let up, especially on weekends when even more staff called in sick. Management bonuses were more a priority than patient care.

Here's how elder care in the U.S. seems to play out:
1) The wealthy will stay home for care with private nurses and aides.
2) Upper middle class patients will have exclusive nursing homes with many material comforts and better chances of proper staffing.
3) The mass of middle class and poor people will end up in sub-standard facilities. For this large portion of the elderly population, the best choice is to search out a Non-Profit facility.

Personally, I don't plan to stick around to be a cash cow for corporate greed or private equity exploitation.  I advise all to make careful consideration when you are faced with living this disrespected stage of life."
2020-05-07 19:17:27,Why is health care - of any form - a for profit industry?
2020-05-07 19:21:38,"The cost for someone to stay in theses facilities is staggering and well beyond any reason.  At the same time, the level of care measured by staffing ratios and things like quality of food is appalling.  

I know because I've had a loved one visit for short-term care and was shocked.  Senior citizens with health issues need more love and attention.  It takes time to get them out of bed, to let them orient themselves, and to process information.  They won't get that in most of these nursing homes with staffing at very low levels, which leaves them confused and lonely.  

Instead I keep my mom at home with me.  The cost of day-care at home is much less, I can better monitor what is going on, and it is one-on-one care. When it is more affordable to do this than to put them into a multi-bed facility, you know something is very out-of-whack with the financial models of these facilities."
2020-05-07 19:25:01,"The article encapsulates putting profits ahead of patients in long term care, but it’s emblematic of all market-driven health care. I’ve spent fifty years in clinical, administrative, regulatory, and education parts of health care. There is no way to reconcile health care and a market-driven delivery model for it is inherently buyer beware. No, you protest. My insurance is non-profit! Don’t be fooled.

When you find that you are under-insured, reached the limit of coverage, does your health care insurer say something like “you would have had coverage for that if you selected our platinum plan” you’ve been told a let the buyer beware-type of statement.

Since 1965, between 60 to 70% of all health care has been market-driven. The remainder is Medicare, Medicaid, military, veterans, etc. Today, health care costs us double per capita of any other first world industrialized country, yielding accepted measures of effectiveness somewhere around 30th in the world. What a bargain to be market-driven!

It’s time for all of health care to join police, fire, public schools, and libraries outside of market system institutions. What’s the profit projection for your county highway department this year? See what I mean?

All of this developing out of an almost neglected loophole in WWII  wage/price controls. Health care to attract factory workers. Bernie is right about health care and wrong about most else. I think Biden accepts health care for all if forced, just a little."
2020-05-07 19:28:33,"""Decades of ownership by private equity and other private investment firms left many nursing homes with staggering bills and razor-thin margins.""

Please recall, that among the offenses of the Reagan administration, was deregulating nursing homes. Putting them at the mercy of unregulated equity and investment firms compounds the abuse.

Businesses are licensed by the government. In all our best interests, government has an obligation to regulate them.

While, Republicans foam at the mouth about ACA death panels. GOP policies are killing people."
2020-05-07 19:29:31,"When we looked for a retirement community, we wanted a non-profit.  And the one we decided on was also faith-related, though it had a clear policy that there was no expectation as to religion, race, etc.  And I’m happy to see that these types of places for the elderly get the highest marks.

Ours is a community which spans the gamut, from independent apartments to assisted living, memory care and a skilled nursing unit.  Across all these units, we have not had one single case of the virus!  For which I credit the fantastic administrative guidance here in addition to the dedication and caring of all the staff, as well as the spiritual values which have guided this community for at least 60 years.

We have been isolating ourselves in our apartments since mid-March.  And the assisted living and skilled nursing shut down even before that.  Everyone is abiding by the distancing and wearing of masks etc. and we receive frequent memos reminding us of staying safe as well as positive messages of how “we’re all in this together.”   No visitors have been allowed and none can come, even on Mother’s Day, which is this Sunday.  But no one is complaining.  

We in this nation need to work together.  Not everything should be privatized.  Particularly things that are a public good, not just a personal choice.  

Everyone here, from the lowest employee, has healthcare, sick days and seems dedicated to keeping this place infection-free as well as emotionally upbeat.  

It can be done."
2020-05-07 19:42:17,"Rest assured that Carlyle did just fine with its investment in  HCR Manorcare.  When Carlyle sold the homes for $6.1 billion to a real estate investment trust, not only was the debt wiped out, but Carlyle received $3.5 Billion in cash.  While Carlyle would have invested a portion of that back into the business, I can assure you that Carlyle used the cash from the transaction to recoup their original $1.3 Billion investment plus a healthy return on capital.  

This common technique is called ""asset stripping"" and has been utilized by PE firms on their investments in retail, hospitals, nursing homes and other real estate or asset heavy industries.  The underlying companies often go bankrupt (in large part due to massive annual payments to lease back real estate they previously owned), but the PE firms have long since recovered their investment plus some."
2020-05-07 19:43:04,And this article is exactly why I took my mother to Mexico 2 1/2 years ago for assisted living. Better care...better facilities...much better food and less than half the price of the U.S. That is a story you should report. There are alternatives.
2020-05-07 19:44:25,"New York State is the only state that doesn't allow publicly-traded for-profit corporations to own healthcare facilities. Former Governor Pataki tried to change that, but not-for-profit organizations made sure that it didn't go through. Nevertheless, not-for-profit and public nursing homes have felt the sting of operating at a loss, due to the fact that labor costs are the biggest expense they face, and Medicaid reimbursement, which is their largest financial supporter, doesn't cover the costs. Private-pay residents pay higher rates than Medicaid reimburses, but that does not make up the fiscal gap. 

Many not-for-profit and public homes have been forced to sell to for-profit groups in New York, and the quality has suffered. 

With that said, I wish people would understand that working in nursing homes is very difficult. To become a certified nursing assistant, one needs to take a 100-hour course and pass a test (in some states, it's 80 hours). The lifting and bending can take a terrible toll on your body. My 38-year-old niece worked for 15 years in long-term care. She's now totally disabled and has had 2 knee replacements and a hip replacement. She loved working with her residents and made great connections with them. What she didn't love was being mandated to work double shifts when her replacement didn't show up. That's what happens when they're short-staffed. 

I wish people who criticize nursing homes would work or observe just one shift. Walk a mile in a CNA's shoes."

When I worked for state government, I saw many nursing homes that couldn't make payroll out of one corporate account suddenly acquire another corporate identity and continue the same scam.   And the Secretary of State did not do any investigations into the tax history of prior corporations tied to the exact same entities.   Anyone can create a corporation if they can pay the minimal filing fees."

2020-05-07 20:16:31,Nursing home nurses have been ringing the alarm bell about this for years. It’s so bad that my wife who is a nurse quit working at nursing homes altogether because they are so understaffed. So why is this a surprise?
2020-05-07 20:18:12,"Very informative from a business perspective. However, I would be more interested in the factors in NYC metro area nursing homes that have led to the devastation wrought by the Covid-19 virus. Economic, regulatory, inspections or lack of, staff training?"

She lived the last year of her life in a Nursing Home because we could not provide the skilled care she needed at 101. We applied her for Medicaid. The facility was understaffed but my mother got excellent care because my brothers and I visited on a rotating schedule every third day. Families  must be visible for their loved ones to get good care. The staff will only care for the patients that have a visible, loving family that scrutinize their daily work and file complaints as needed...sad to say."
2020-05-07 20:55:05,"You can learn all you need to know about the horrors of nursing homes and other senior care facilities by tracing the operators’ campaign contributions.  There’s a reason why this industry is so lightly monitored.

My experience is not with nursing homes, but with their equally smarmy cousin: assisted living.  It was easy for my father’s facility — replete with fancy curtains and chandeliers to impress the children — to make a profit on him.  All they had to do was tell the family he needed two aides to assist him at substantial extra cost . . . and then give him just a single staff member when we weren’t there.  The night before he died, I found him slumped in his wheelchair in the lobby, attended by no one.  Had I not been present to demand assistance, I’m not sure how long he would have been left there."
2020-05-07 20:55:27,Healthcare needs to be separated from private equity. Any aspect of healthcare in which private equity attaches its claws into becomes a miserable experience for both patients and providers. Private Equity and insurance companies are the worst things to happen to how care is delivered. Their vociferous greed has been brought to the forefront during this pandemic.
2020-05-07 20:57:26,"Money? The for-profits don't have it because the money is Scrooged-up by the owners. The non-profits don't have it to begin with. Mark these words: There will be investigations that will try to put all the blame on the nursing assistants, the bottom of the medical hierarchy, for failure to follow infection control procedures. Instead, as was drilled into me when I worked in nursing home administration, institutional and structural issues generally lie at the foundation of problems in nursing homes. As is often the case in this kind of issue, follow the money."
2020-05-07 20:58:25,"So the media is now reluctantly waking up to the truth. This is not an epidemic similar to cholera or the plague. Healthy young people are not walking out the door in the morning and being buried by dusk.  This is a public health problem, yes, but it is a problem of the elderly and frail made much, much worse by poor care.  Even among the aged, many would probably have survived given decent nursing care.  Instead, they were ping-ponged back and forth between hospitals and nursing homes, neither of whom actually wants to treat them or do anything but hoover up their money. We did not need to destroy the economy. We need to destroy the current nursing home system.  What should replace it may be debatable - a return to public facilities, or to religious organizations, or most shocking of all, to doctors and nurses making house calls. But the current nursing home industry is clearly not fit for purpose."
2020-05-07 21:02:26,"This circumstance is just one more reason why health care should not be a part of the ""market"". 

The fallacy perpetrated by the folks who claim ""free markets"" benefit the nation and economy is that they work in health care as well. But here's why: truly ""free markets"" are those in which buyers and sellers have equal negotiating power. But the buyers in health care are the sick, injured, and the elderly, the very people have minimal or no bargaining power. When someone is severely ill or has been badly injured in an accident, they need care at that moment. They don't have the luxury of sitting at their computers and ""shopping"" for an emergency room.

And when they walk into an emergency room or hospital, they immediately find themselves at the mercy of the sellers, the hospitals, clinics, medical device makers, the insurance industry, etc. ... all of whom has ""profit"" as their #1 goal. When people in need of health care have to compete against profits, they lose.

Health care for people, not for profit!"

2020-05-07 21:03:52,"My husband is the medical director for a nursing home. He's been collaborating with the nurses to try to keep the residence safe but it's been an uphill, terrifying battle. Our state has been on ”sheltering in place” orders for 2 months and they JUST got the funding this week to test every nursing home patient and employees for COVID-19. Last week he got to work and about 15 employees we're having a pizza party with no social distancing, no masks, etc. He says he feels like the dad who keeps busting the kids for breaking the rules. The lower-skilled employees are paid very little and it's not an easy job."
2020-05-07 21:06:25,"This virus has painfully revealed the weaknesses and absurdity of capitalism in the context of nursing homes and health care in general. It is hard to imagine a worse combination than for profit investors running nursing homes, particularly without significant government oversight.  The type of care that nursing home residents require is labor intensive and residents without vigilant relatives are incredibly vulnerable to neglect and abuse.  Caring for the elderly is at its best a labor of love, not an opportunity to make a quick buck. There has to be a better way. Long term planning for end of life care should be required and subsidized. Also perhaps some type of coop model would work better for those who require institutional care. As much as possible, residents and their families should have a stake and a say in their own care. We are all going to get old and many may require support if they live long enough. Leaving that support to corporations ""the markets"" is a fools errand."
2020-05-07 21:13:00,"Good article but why no mention of the massive contributions of nursing home industry to politicians. In NYS Gov. Cuomo has gotten hundreds of thousands of dollars and issued an Executive order in March EXEMPTING nursing homes from ANY civil liability regardless of their horrific neglect. I would say that was a very good ""investment"" but nursing home industry"
2020-05-07 21:15:23,"When are we going to learn that the last place we need capitalism and the profit motive is in the care of vulnerable people, like the sick and elderly.  Medical care, particularly long term care for those in frail health because of age, chronic illness or injury, should not be yielding profits for businessmen.  All of these organizations should be managed for the benefit of the residents while paying a fair wage to workers and structure routines to incentives adequate care.

When my husband needed care after an injury, I was appalled at the work loads the low paid aides were expected to manage. I often spent 12 to 15 hours a day with my husband, caring for him as I knew the overworked staff could not provide adequate care, no matter how much they might wish to provide it. And the two nursing homes we used were generally well rated. I was lucky to have the time and resources to bring my loved one home as soon as possible.

Thankfully, this was before a silent killer started stalking nursing homes."

The company was part of a giant ""health care"" Real Estate Investment Trust comprised of hospitals, nursing homes and ALFs and seeking to maximize profit for shareholders.

Tell me if anyone can live off of a $9 an hour wage while working as a prison guard? No government contracts should be given out to anyone unless it involves the dignified care of the disabled and the dignified respect of employees.

2020-05-08 00:12:46,"This is a template that private equity has long used in takeovers of stable, often family-owned or closely held businesses.  At its worst, the buyers use the target's assets as collateral for purchase money financing and the target as the borrower.  They split the real estate from the operations because they know that, under the burden of servicing the debt and paying excessive management fees to the buyers and their affiliates, the operational side will struggle.  It will raise prices and reduce costs, esp labor, but the operational side will eventually fail, so that longtime employees suffer and, if they had pensions, they lose most of their retirement money.  And then the buyers can take the real estate and redevelop or sell it.

I don't know that this happens only in America, but it happens especially in America."
2020-05-08 00:22:35,"Nursing Homes DID used to have Standards, which were held because the local folks who worked there and owned the place had respect and positions to maintain in the Community! The community 'held' the standards, and standards were more stringent.  I worked in them in the 1970s as a student Nurse.  This was before the top of the food chain eliminated checks and balances and standards and made MBAs with MDs kings of the mountain.  The expensive care centers are another matter, but the being 'held in place' if family is no longer local is far more tentative  and these are now being built by investors.  EVery aspect of healthcare and healing have been decimated by the medical industrial complex in the US.  Don't you like it???"

And I challenge every Boomer-and-beyond who has a 401k or other investment portfolio to dig in or ask their advisors to dig deep into the accounts and weed out any of these predatory holdings. 

Only if deprived of investment dollars will these greed fund managers have to exit the scene or clean up their act."
2020-05-08 01:27:36,Outlawing for-profit nursing homes and other essential health-care facilities is long overdue.

I am OCD about taking the best care of my health as possible, but if I were to ever become that sick even if I have to end it myself -- that's it.  For me, lying in a bed like that with no value to myself or anyone else is not a life worth living -- I don't even trust doctors -- I sure don't trust some underpaid person in charge of me.  I'm in my 70s -- still a practicing attorney, hiker, active -- even dating.  I've lived a great life, and when I'm done -- I'm done.  I will not be a burden to my children or society."

When we allow ""investors"" to make millions operating health care facilities, we are effectively transferring wealth to the already wealthy.  

If ever there was an argument that we need non-profit, single payer health coverage in this country, this is it. Health care dollars should pay for health care, and not be siphoned off to investors or shareholders to line their pockets at the expense of the vulnerable of our society."

The private pay rate is $13,000 per month, and that doesn't include all the additional services that are billed to Medicare and to his supplemental insurance.  The home is pretty lousy, but far from the worst. The issue isn't just private equity and venture capital, although I'm sure that's an additional problem in the for-profit homes. This industry needs a complete overhaul, and I'm not sure who can lead it, as the issues in nursing homes long precede Trump. 

Unlike college or other life milestones, most people hope and pray they never end up in a nursing home, so maybe they think they can ignore the issue? Always very fit and healthy, my dad never, ever thought he would end up in one of ""those places,"" but he also didn't imagine that he'd develop dementia, incontinence, and become paralyzed from back pain in his 90s either. His parents lived to an old age and died in their sleep, so he thought he'd be the same."

Many of these substandard nursing homes operate under the same constraints, as the PE firms accumulate massive debts in the businesses and run them so that they are not permanently in violation of staffing laws and quality standards. As noted here, the closed network of suppliers means that the nursing homes pay top dollar for their needs, with the profits going to the same PE firms that own the suppliers. 

The PE firms and their leaders are a scourge on our society. The drastic changes to our economy caused by the covid-19 pandemic is helping to make clear how they have been making billions each year since the advent of Michael Milken and his fellow vultures. They continue to ""make contributions"" to our elected representatives and, for now at least, can continue to operate with impunity. The dying patients are just their collateral damage."

2020-05-08 05:27:14,"I used to work on the psych ward of a suburban hospital near a big city. All our patients were committed and, because of that fact state law set the staffing standards. If you had x amount of patients you had to have y amount of staff working. Then corporate decided to open a “voluntary unit” for non-committed patients. Because this  unit was not beholden to the same staffing requirements. corporate staffed it with the bare minimum of personnel to increase their bottom line and stuffed it with lucrarive Alzhiemers' patients who required time consuing care.   Within months of opening, a younger patient managed to walk off the voluntary unit and onto an adjacent abandoned medical floor and then fell out of fourth floor window. She was severely injured. Then, a few weeks later, a newly admitted patient committed suicide within half an hour of arrival. The reason all these things happened was because the staff were stretched too thin and could not provide adequate care and supervision. Instead of admitting their miserly profit driven staffing was to blame, corpoate fired several staff and then dragged us into meetings to tell us how this was all “our fault.”  All corporate cared about was profit – often over human life. Sadly, many nursing homes and hospitals are like this so it’s no surprise many of then were caught flatfooted during the COVID-19 epidemic.  The profit driven rot in American health care is wide, pervasive and deadly."
2020-05-08 05:48:43,"The nursing home industry has all along been forced to operate dishonestly.  Inmates being paid for by the government yield fees that cannot possibly cover the cost of the their room, board and proper care. Hence the operators of these geriatric warehouses are compelled to resort to shifty practices and corner cuttings in order to make ends meet.  Of course no one forces anyone to  be in this horrible business. Like the worst landlords, it often attracts people who are seriously deficient in the heart department. But still, it takes two to tango and government is hardly blameless. Hence there is no way of knowing whether more ethically anchored operators would be able to do any better under the circumstances."
2020-05-08 07:54:29,"I don't think people know that nursing homes lobbied to change the rules for nursing homes re the number of staff required . In other care facilities that receive federal money, a certain staff ratio is required.  The nursing home industry managed to get an exception to that (at least in New York).  This resulted in nursing homes not having adequate staff. For example, where my father was a resident on Long Island, the aides only had 10 minutes to get each resident up, toileted and dressed. Having to do this in such a short period of time actually hurt people that had trouble moving their arms, for example, or had shoulder pain. Already short-staffed, the number of staffers on weekends and holidays was even lower.  This needs to change --nursing homes should no longer be exempt from those staffing requirements."

2020-05-08 09:37:27,"OPM, aka Other People’s Money, has much to do with this phenomenon. It is akin to how healthcare in general in US is substandard and overpriced. Because the individual patient residents are not usually footing the bill, rather it is Medicare and Medicaid, the resident is not sensitive to the cost of living there. Once the patient has no say in the costs then he is just a pawn in the game. A pliant customer to rake in monthly payments from his Uncle Sam. A unit of measure to bill against. The same goes for regular folks visiting hospitals for all sorts of medical needs. We don’t even know the cost because our insurer is assumed to be covering it. The surprise comes too late."
2020-05-08 09:41:20,"There is a nursing home around the corner from my house. From the time I moved into my house 17 years ago until 4 years ago they had a sign that stated ""proud to be deficiency free"" which means that they passed State Inspection with zero deficiencies. When the sign came down I asked around and found out that the nursing home had been purchased by a corporate entity."
2020-05-08 09:43:29,"It seems part of the private equity game is financial engineering. The actual residents’ living center may NOT be financially profitable per se. Rather, it can be bled by separating the real estate asset from the operations. Then the owners of the real estate can charge a hefty rent to the establishment and shelter the income from taxes via depreciation and other offsets.  Also a nice paycheck to the top managers can also drain the possibility of significant profits from the facility. So not only is there little leftover for spending on the residents, low taxes to be paid on meager profits and virtually no new assets to seek money if there is tortious liability. Smart set up."
2020-05-08 11:53:45,"Avoid if at all possible, putting a family member in one of these for profit homes!   Especially if that family member has dementia because they can’t tell you about being mistreated.   Bed sores for those immobile are a major source of infection and health decline in these places because without adequate staff these sores can lead to surgery or amputation of the affected body part.   Having good staff to patient ratios keeps everyone healthy but for-profit nursing homes do not want to pay and constantly run below staff requirements just to squeeze out more more money.   Many people in these places suffer needlessly in their last days, months or years.  And many suffer in silence because they are unable to communicate how they are treated.

Recently Trump and Secretary of Health Velma have been pushing for existing nursing homes regulations to be cut or eliminated.  For example, they want infection control inspectors and inspections to be reduced even though the existing ones are already inadequate.   They are trying to push dangerous and medically unethical practices in these facilities that already have terrible medical practice.   Sen, Elizabeth Warren has been fighting against these dangerous and inhumane nursing homes but the GOP has blocked any new legislation!    Many of these for-profit nursing home facilities are death sentences for our loved ones!"
2020-05-08 13:30:57,"What this tells me is that nursing homes are not able to offer the care at a price the public can pay that is profitable to investment community.

2020-05-08 14:10:12,"All of the outrage about nursing homes is disingenuous. I have been a regular visitor to nursing homes throughout the country for the last 30 years. The most telling graph in this story is the one that shows the operating margins. The best have an operating margin of around 0.5% (these are supposedly the the non-profits). They are all underfunded. 

Most are funded by Medicare and Medicaid - the American society. They've been operating this way for decades. Anyone with eyes simply needs to visit one of these ""homes"". Don't blame politicians and the people who operate the nursing homes. Take a look in the mirror."

2020-05-07 19:48:45,"Before anyone starts blaming nursing homes for all the  many cases of and deaths from coronavirus, I suggest looking at the basic infrastructure of the facilities. Little has changed in nursing homes since they began in the sixties except that patients are older and sicker. They still look like mini hospitals, usually two persons to a room. These roommates are chronically ill with multiple diseases. Staffing is poor, even in the fanciest of places, and care is provided by underpaid, low skilled individuals.  Nursing  staff, also underpaid, include one or two per shift. Most staff do their work because they love the elderly.
As a geriatrician who has worked in many nursing facilities, I have first hand knowledge of  how sparce necessary medical suppies are.  If I needed an X-ray or lab work, I usually had to wait a day. I used to joke that it was like I was working in a refugee camp. 
When an infection spreads in a nursing home, it's a struggle.  The last time there was a Norwalk virus outbreak, it was immediately rampant. There is no patient Zero, there are patients one trough 15 right at the start.  The staff did their best to quarantine affected residents without any increase in funding or personnel. Meals, visiting policies and activities had to be changed. No one died.
Generally, nursing homes are for profit. Shareholders want to see the money. Isn't that what businesses do?
I think all nursing home should be shut down. Stop warehousing elders and start over creatively."
2020-05-08 07:57:42,"I worked in a hospital in the US and was left aghast at the condition of many nursing home residents admitted for urgent medical care due to the  bed sores some the size of footballs with hip bones visible. Preventable in most cases by simply turning the patients every few hours.
I have worked in 3 different continents and never seen anything like the neglect I witnessed there.
I suppose when the bottom line is unregulated profit someone has to pay the price."
2020-05-08 01:40:19,"While I agree nursing home care has become increasingly inadequate, the blame should not solely be put on the owners.  Years ago, nursing home care was superior than it is today, staffed with more qualified nurses, at a higher nurse per resident ratio.  This is no longer the case, and it is mainly because insurance companies, particularly Medicaid, no longer reimburse the nursing homes at a rate high enough to afford adequate care.  If changes should be made, it should start with constituents demanding more funds be directed at Medicaid for its senior residents."
2020-05-08 17:23:17,"Based on a recommendation from a nurse, my mother started in assisted living in a non-profit elder care organization, where, after a year or so she had to move to a nursing unit, because of a fall. We could not have forseen that she would spend eight satisfactory more years there--with good resident to CNA ratios, very stable RN staffing, etc. The lesson we learned: avoid for-profit ""care"" whenever you can."

Once again, Trump is using the federal intelligence and foreign policy bureaucracy for private political aims.  It has become so brazen—and so profoundly insipid—that disentangling the truth from the hideous lies of Trumpworld will take years.

Much of the way companies use current biotech to make vaccines is known to a great degree to anyone who wants to take the time to look.

A foreign country hacking in to the Pentagon or our power grid is something to be very worried about.  

A foreign country (if really  being done) hacking into how to fight this disease should be offered a seat at the table with other world scientists.

Are US companies more worried about patent infringement than solving the Covid-19 puzzle? This is the real problem with the Trump administration. This America first is coming back to blow up in Trump's face. The US should be working with the WHO and all countries to find a cure that we all can benefit from. The doors should be open to all knowledge accrued about this virus instead of wasting valuable time duplicating efforts, but cooperation is not something Trump understands. He's too small a person."

From a different angle: If ""bad actors"" steal propietary information, but that eventually leads to better means to arrest the spread of the virus, is that a bad thing--or a good thing?

This pandemic was a wake up call the China is only interested in a future world dominated by China.  The health and well-being of non-Chinese people is secondary.  They will, and have, engaged in all matters of subterfuge and deceipt to achieve it.  

That deceipt consists of jailing doctors who say they've seen a new viral disease, corrupting the WHO to oppose a travel ban from China (what possible scientific reason could there have been for the WHO to oppose a travel ban from Wuhan in January?), utter lying about their death tolls, and brutal suppression of the truth no matter by whom it is spoken.

These transgressions can be added to throwing Muslims in concentration camps and militarily colonizing the South China Sea as well as the rest of their human rights violations.

Perhaps America will wake up now?"
2020-05-11 14:05:54,Beware a beleaguered US Administration that is desperate to blame others for its own incompetence. Trump and his toadies would rather start a Cold War or trade war with China than admit to their disastrous handling of the COVID 19 pandemic.

Today, the problem we're facing at home isn't that hostile countries might steal our science, it's that the GOP and Trump have been attacking our own science for years now - firing outstanding scientists when they refuse to lie in order to publicly promote the president's fake news line of the day, massively reducing investment in scientific research, and then starting to work on a vaccine too late, and in a totally messy way - here too, the GOP preferred to listen to its campaign managers and wealthiest donors, rather than to experts.

And then there's the fact that the current administration decided to stop paying into crucial international research funds, even though the US is the wealthiest country on earth.

Seen from abroad, after all the lying and all the hatred spewed against its own international allies ... it seems highly likely that the current US government ITSELF is already committing cybertheft and trying to get other countries' vaccine data..."

Name a single breakthrough in physics, electronics, chemistry, mathematics, genetics, or biology made by China in the last 20 years.

I'm talking about things like the transistor, the laser, the smart phone, the sequencing of the human genome - breakthroughs at that level.

If you find that too limiting, i.e. can't find a single breakthrough, then feel free to expand your search to music, art, literature, fashion .... and you still won't find anything.

Bottom line: China copies and steals because they can't innovate. Vaccine research is no different."

All because this is the Trump administration and, of course, one must oppose everything that it does.

Such fools."

This smells of yet another attempt at distraction by the administration to take the focus off the 81,000 who have died of this virus in the US.  The most cases of any country, the most deaths of any country.  No coordinated national leadership by the little man with a big ego in the White House, NO activation of the Defense Production Act to produce testing for all Americans, as 2,000 to 3,000 continue to die each day (2 people die each minute, 1 every 27 seconds) No leadership from D.C.

I don't see a conflict between the US and China. I see a conflict between US and Chinese bureaucrats, on one side, and US and Chinese scientists, on the other side. 

Under Obama, we had scientific collaborations with the Chinese, and our scientists shared information freely. Trump ended those collaborations. Now Trump is complaining that the Chinese no longer share information freely. 

It is true that Chinese bureaucrats at first censored doctors like Li Wenliang, who spoke too freely about covid-19. It is also true that Trump censored doctors like Nancy Messonnier, who also spoke too freely about covid-19 (and are still doing it). So what exactly is Mike Pompeo's complaint? 

As Science magazine editor Holden Thorp noted, Trump ordered that all information from the covid-19 task force had to be approved (censored) by Mike Pence -- a man who doesn't believe in evolution, or that cigarettes are harmful."

Nothing the GOP does is as it seems.

Great report last night on 60 minutes; we had our own team ALREADY working with the Chinese in the Wuhan lab doing serious research on coronaviruses.

The Trump administration cut their funding. So while publicly the Trump administration is accusing China of all sorts of things, it's the Trump administration forcing our own people out of the lab!

Why are they trying to prevent the world from knowing the truth about the most likely natural origins of this virus?

Do they want war?

Are they trying to keep the American public in the dark regarding the alternative economic/political model that China offers the world?

Are they trying to force Americans back to work prematurely so that they don't have show us the lies underpinning Conservative/Libertarian ideology which surely would happen if they chose our lives over their ideological agenda.

How? If the Federal Gov sent us a monthly check & provided health insurance to hold us over until we truly broke the back of this virus, many would say back to work? Sure but we don't ever want to go back to the things that poll after poll indicate were driving us to depression, stress & destruction of the biosphere."

There are no Chinese armies, or Chinese proxies, taking over countries all over the world, as the Soviet Union did. The nature of the Chinese threat is commercial and scientific. IMHO, they try to defeat us in a peaceful, but significant competition in Science/technology/business/etc. The competition is real, but there is no need to transform it into a ‘hot’ one that can risk the future of Mankind. Actually, I consider this to be UNAMERICAN. Americans rise to the challenges and are fiercely competitive. They have a can-do-it, positive attitude. Whining and crying are NOT the virtues our forebearers were known for. We should rise to the challenge in the field it is posed. We should become more intelligent, educated, productive, innovative, etc. to win this new challenge.

 Indeed our own govt sponsored research working towards a vaccine for coronoviruses has been halted by an adminstration seeking political gain at the expense of American lives.

  BioHealth is a small nonprofit that's been plugging away gathering specimens from the local populace and bat caves in China but since their research proved years ago that SARS like coronoviruses in bats had made the jump to humans years hence that puts the lie to this administration's claims that China manufactured and released it.

  One has to wonder as well if this nonprofit's size or lack of funds coupled with their successes is a factor.

  BioHealth saw their research as giving them a leg up on a vaccine for Covid-19 because they were already working on its cousins, but what if their efforts were seen as too successful?
What if Big Pharma wanted to claim the profits from the discovery of a vaccine needed by billions?

BioHealth could hardly compete in the scramble to fund the buying of friends and influence in Washington.

Big Pharma has made lots of friends, and given the blatent back scratching between this administration, big donors, and business interests this aspect becomes a forgone conclusion to ""Make America Great""-

Melitta #4 filters have been out of stock for months here - fortunately I was able to procure a case online and promptly delivered by the much needed US Post Office.

The industrial meat industry is revolting, from the steroids and hormones that are injected into animals (and find their way into our bodies) to the unsanitary conditions in the production.  And it all looks so nice in the grocery store.

Aside from that, eating vegan is a practical way of maintaining an appropriate weight.  When I get the munchies during the night, I eat raw cauliflower, not ice cream.

The adjustment has not been easy.  I still salivate when I smell meat cooking in my neighbors' apartments.  You sort of put up with it, and then begin to appreciate it for its positive qualities.

I hope people see the connection between the inhumane treatment of workers and animals and their “need” to consume so much meat. Maybe the scarcity of it will cause families to stretch their imaginations and serve a few meat-free meals a week.

It’s patently obvious that workers in meat-packing plants are part of a large work force, largely lower-paid, that are willingly or not the “front-line” employees keeping food on our tables.  There’s a large cohort of highly-paid tech force “working from home”, a managerial and financial class having zero issues with making the rent or mortgage payments, and those high-income retirees secure in their monthly payouts.  No, these are the “regular folks”, as the Wisconsin Supreme Court Chief Justice noted the other day, leaving, e.g., meat-packer workers as the not-so “regular folks”.  If anything, the CV epidemic has only intensified the inequities and stratifications of American society, despite all the cliché-mongering to the contrary."

If that means not caring about the health and safety of workers to get out the cheapest product, industry will do just that failing meaningful regulation and oversight."

There are only four major meatpackers operating in this country, and at least two of them are foreign owned. They have applied assembly line techniques in the processing of animal carcuses. The rate of line speed is always too fast, causing numerous injuries as a result. 
But we have an Administration filled with unqualified individuals whose loyalty is to Trump, not to workers who fill these unpleasant jobs. The Secretary of Labor, the son of now deceased Supreme Court Judge Scalia, is one of those. His job is to enforce the health and safety laws, but he views his job as protecting corporate America from the very workers the laws were written to protect. 
Meat for every meal is not an essential need, and certainly not if it means the deaths of those who produce the product."

Don't hold your breath waiting for one of Trump's partisan judges to overturn that decision--they only care about ""justice"" for Republiican cronies and donors.

Where is the outcry? Where is the public shaming of meat plant owners, like the outcry after big companies scarfed up  the money meant for small businesses?
Where is the call to boycott Tyson?  Do Americans love bacon more than human life?

Or do these workers fall into Trump's categories of rapists, murderers and terrorists, and thus don't deserve our support?"
2020-05-10 15:19:46,"""Workers, many of them immigrants, were crowded elbow to elbow as they broke down hog carcasses zipping by on a conveyor belt.""

A de-limbed tree trunk is scanned by lasers as it travels on a high-speed conveyor.  Using that information, plus current market rates for particular cuts of lumber, a computer determines the best way to cut up each individual log.  The computer then controls flexible saws that can even follow the shape or bend of log, producing in seconds the optimum number and types of boards.  A hog or beef carcass is regular enough to permit similar, accurate cutting and sorting, thus eliminating hordes of unnecessary manual labor for that portion of the process.

The meat industry is ripe for automation.  The only thing preserving the manual processes is the cheap price of labor."
2020-05-10 15:47:50,"I do believe that most Americans and in particularly immigrants know that there is something wrong about themselves and thus they do not deserve to be treated with dignity, or even be treated fairly. The people constantly vote for cruel leaders, and whether they be republican or democrat, they work for the corporations. Thus the people signal their willingness and perhaps desire to be treated cruelly. It is difficult to be empathetic to those who chose a path of suffering.

Many are convinced that they need to have children, and they do this when their own lives are dependent upon working for cruel employers. Many others feel it is their duty to spend and consume at maximum levels so as to create jobs for these same cruel employers.

A man stand in the street and hits himself in the face with a hammer. He is a typical American. He is in pain but he does it to himself. Shall we feel sorry for him? 

Generally speaking, if you try to help these people they will attack you and will consider you a weakling and stupid. They believe that a painful life is the best life."

2020-05-10 15:02:07,"People's lives are more important than pork chops. The sheriff ought to have been able to order the plant closed down. Safety measures should have already been in place. But there is another issue: why is Tyson using illegal labor? The chicken plants were raided a year ago. Another problem is the lack of communication. When workers can't speak English, and the company who has hired undocumented workers doesn't bother to get a translator, of course employees will get sick. I hope that ICE doesn't let this one go and neither should Trump. When ICE raided the chicken plants, the jobs were then filled by Americans who gladly gave up their minimum wage jobs at MacDonald's for the much better paying chicken plant."
2020-05-10 15:16:33,"Trump doesn't care about the cost to the workers, he doesn't want to be blamed if his supporters can't get their ribs.  The next question, since the people at the plant are working sick, can they infect the meat?  Can COVID-19 be passed on by tainted meat processed by sick workers?  Has an independent lab checked (sorry but I don't trust the packing plant's lab or Trump's)?"

And I would add a third question: which is most important to the nation as a whole: the fact Tyson blamed illness on ""absenteeism,""  the fact someone got sick all over the meat and had a raging fever, or the fact that the plant had over 1,000 infected imployees, some on ventilators and some dead, while the president kept yelling push, push, and push these workers some more?

This tale is worse than any by Dickens.  I can't get over the utter hypocrisy of the anti-immigration crowd to let those who do the dirty work of processing their pork chops keep on working under toxic conditions instead of being thrown out of the country.

2020-05-10 16:28:38,"In September 2011, sheriff’s deputies in Iowa encountered Chinese men near a field where a farmer was growing corn seed under contract with Monsanto. What began as a simple trespassing inquiry mushroomed into a two-year FBI operation in which investigators bugged the men’s rental cars, used a warrant intended for foreign terrorists and spies, and flew surveillance planes over corn country—all in the name of protecting trade secrets of corporate giants Monsanto and DuPont Pioneer. In The Scientist and the Spy, Hvistendahl gives a gripping account of this unusually far-reaching investigation, which pitted a veteran FBI special agent against Florida resident Robert Mo, who after his academic career foundered took a questionable job with the Chinese agricultural company DBN—and became a pawn in a global rivalry. Industrial espionage by Chinese companies lies beneath the United States’ recent trade war with China, and it is one of the top counterintelligence targets of the FBI. But a decade of efforts to stem the problem have been largely ineffective. “The Scientist and the Spy” is both an important exploration of the issues at stake and a compelling, involving read."

Quite simply, we need a revolution in protective gear and support for workers.

For example, pig farmers have the legal right to block health inspectors from their farms even if the evidence shows that farm might have been the source of tainted pork.

The reason?  Political power.  And the pork industry's blatant attitude that its profits matter more than human lives.

And with it, the exploitation of low wage immigrant workers. So they are supplied with masks and some plexi, the work is still dangerous as before without assurances. At best, this is a makeshift temporary highlight due to the pandemic. Soon to be forgotten whenever it abates. Like the animals who are nothing more than commodity. To become neat styrofoam packages of specific animal parts. As we are barred from the visuals, both human and animal, I am left to imagine the sounds as well.

Where such leave is not required, 20% of food service workers report for work sick. This article states that when the virus appeared, Tyson offered partially paid sick leave. And it and other companies want to be absolved of any financial responsibility for people getting sick as a result of reopening. And who bears the financial and health risks of the reopening?

The Trump hypocrisy of demonizing them for being ""illegal"" (even when many are not), and then demanding that they do the menial work that is beneath us makes me vomit."

2020-05-10 16:50:50,"Factory-farmed meat is the problem.  Several generations ago, meat was sent, whole carcass, to local butchers, who then broke them down and sold the cuts.  It's hard work, but if the butchers want to work harder, great, they make more money--they have some stake in the product. But it's up to them.  These assembly-lines forcing immigrants to work non-stop are inhumane, and they should be shut down.  If it means we pay twice as much for meat, so be it.  Factory farms exacerbate the problems of illegal immigration, and now foment the spread of COVID.  Disgusting."

Tortured animals, unsanitary conditions, obscenely cheap meat, and the result - the country drowning in its own fat. Forget about the (improbable) transmission of the virus via infected meat. Just look at yourself in the mirror. Obesity is an aggravating condition for Covid-19. More than 40 percent of Americans are obese. If anything accounts for the higher mortality rates in the country as compared to the rest of the world, it is those one-dollar burgers that Americans apparently can’t live without. So the meat-plant workers should risk their lives in order for the meat-eaters to endanger theirs? The entire country needs to go on a diet. And closing down all feedlots, slaughterhouses and meat-processing plants would be a good beginning."

Now it is deemed essential (an Orwellian relabeling of workers who until recently were deemed “illegal” and “dangerous”) work that simply must continue even if it endangers human lives. All so Americans (some of the most overweight and unhealthy people on the planet) can continue to over feed on pigs. The definition of a sick, out of balance society."

They knew how the virus was spread, it was all over the media and yet  the CEO's did nothing to change the work environment.

The governors are threatening the workers if they don't go back to work they cant get unemployment..  

If the Governor's refuse to treat the employees with dignity and respect, the majority of us will stop eating meat.

2020-05-10 18:26:37,"Even meat processing plants can open safely: slow-down the processing lines; implement regular testing and temperature taking; run multiple shifts (maybe 3) to reduce the number of workers in the plant and on any given line; execute daily plant sterilization and provide masks for all healthy workers.

Hog and beef ranchers need this supply chain distribution service open otherwise they will be forced to kill their livestock because they have no place to send, and cannot afford to feed, their livestock. 

It’s a vicious circle repeating itself in industry after industry. Milk is a perfect example: if milk processing plants are closed, where do dairy farmers send their milk? Right now they throw it away. Remember, schools are recipients of milk in little cartons. Schools are closed thereby shutting down that distribution chain.

These are just two ways a Federally organized and planned strategy was needed."

Others can take a shift each week also.  For instance, Wisconsin Supreme Court Chief Justice Roggensack, of course, Trump, Pence, Alex Azar ........the list is long.

2020-05-10 18:14:02,"Part 1: If you have listened to Rachel Maddow over the past couple of weeks, you would know that the spread of the corona virus is not a problem of only one plant but of all packing and processing plants.  The single biggest mechanism for spreading the virus is packing large amounts of people in closed spaces.  Everyone knows this.  Nation wide, social distancing has been preached as the best way to slow down the virus.  Church services were canceled. Concerts, sporting events, everything except meat processing plants.  In Finney county, Kansas, where I grew up, there is a large outbreak because of the processing plant there.  Like Iowa, the state supports the plants, and is forcing workers to go to work.  If they don't work, they don't get paid.  They are not eligible for unemployment benefits even if working there might cause them to get sick and die.  Trump wants his meat, and he wants everything back to normal so that he can get re-elected.  The Federal government (CDC, FDA) could have made all these plants practice safe working practices, but the meat industry is in control."

During this time, it is the immigrants, the colored people, the economic disadvantageous who--like those workers in Tyson meatpacking plant--keep others' essentials needs to be met.  During normal time, we don't care about the terrible working conditions they were in, we don't care about the kind of discrimination they experienced.  When we don't have pork chops, we begin to pay attention to them?

The Tyson plant is a typical case of how capitalism, the rich and the powerful exploits workers, this time not their wages, but their lives!

Not eating meat nor boycotting Tyson is the solution, the basic economic and social structure has to change after the pandemic, so we can eat our pork chops with a good conscience."

The overreaction to the pandemic, the mania to drive our economy into a wall at 300 mph, is founded on statistically ambiguous evidence.  It is thus insane.  We live in terror now and the media is complicit.  Is this what they talk about when they talk about the ""feminization"" of society?  Industry dies while we all cower inside our houses and call the president a narcissist, as if his primary duty were to be a good boyfriend?  I am beyond disgusted with the lack of empathy in the press for people who CANNOT work from home, who make their living with their hands.  

Trump continues to take bold action to manage this pandemic.  The only statistic that matters (deaths per million) shows the US to be far better off than many European countries.  Trump and some of the governors, especially the gov. of Florida, deserve major credit."

Yet he is in effect ordering thousands of workers to go back to work in meat packing plants that have already proven to be extremely toxic sources of Covid-19 infections.

Those workers should claim that they have bone spurs that qualify them for sick leave and full pay until the pandemic ends."
2020-05-10 18:44:22,"Fearful workers become anger workers. 80 to 100 years ago that lead to strikes and violence and in the end strong unions and a prosperous middle class. The companies slowly eroded the rights of workers and gutted the middle class. I think that it will not be long before todays workers begin acts of sabotage on these meat processing lines. It would only take some metal or plastic shavings in the meat to force a recall of millions of pounds and make consumers fearful of their food. The workers have more power in their hands, to either appeal to management's/ owner's morals and ethics. If that doesn't work then subtle violence that brings the message home to the share holders and the meat eating public. Trump wants to be seen as a war time President. He may be getting a war he never planned on. His war and the huge corporation's war on works may not turn out as planned. Remember Bruce Catton's quote concerning the starting of the Civil War, ""It began as men wanted. It did not go as men had planned."" War's never do."
2020-05-10 18:48:44,40 degrees the same temperature as your refrigerator is ideal for the growth of bacteria and viruses.    Meat processing plants must be cooled to preserve the meet.  Perhaps this is why they have so many problems.

A fear of successful judgements is the most powerful means of ensuring that companies like Tyson make responsible decisions during the pandemic.

Americans need to understand that “capitalism” and “free markets” are not the same thing.  Through a relentless process of consolidation, opacity, and corporate control of government, US companies are eliminating free markets that have served average citizens so well in the past. It is high time that average citizens fight to regain the markets that made our country great."

There is no solidarity between this white house and the workers, no sharing of the risks. Fair to say that no one in a ranking Democrat family has shown up either. With a large number of meat workers out sick or dead there is not one familiar name in the line of fire."
2020-05-10 19:02:41,"This, more than anything, feels like an exposure of how terrible America's food system is. Since when did we all collectively decide that it was better to have all of our meat shipped in from thousands of miles away, made in often unsanitary plants operated by abused workers, to be cut apart and plastic wrapped at a meat counter rather than local butchers and grocers? 

Just think: If this is how sanitary the plants can be during a worldwide pandemic with a deadly virus with unknown complications, how good are these plants during regular flu outbreaks, or other diseases that kill americans by the truckload each year? Us americans separation from our food is unhealthy"

2020-05-10 19:19:48,"One of the secondary problems here is you have a single plant responsible 4% of the pork in the entire country. When industry is allowed to consolidate to this degree it creates critical failure points that didn’t exist when this production was dispersed among smaller producers. 

If it were one small plant affected it could be dealt with and there wouldn’t be enormous market pressures to put people back to work in an unsafe environment as is the case with Tyson’s Waterloo plant. 

The current problem with meatpacking is not unrelated to the fact 90% of critical PPE production has been outsourced to China. Market consolidation and globalization has undermined public safety and national security and left us without the resilience to respond to a crisis."

Once born a hog has to be fed between four months and a year before going to slaughter, cattle around eighteen months.  Once the protein supply chain is broken, it takes years to reestablish and the interim cost to consumers, producers and processors is outrageous.  While producers could continue to feed livestock it is expensive and an older animals meat is not as desirable and costs more.  The only relief for producers would be payment for euthanizing livestock which was unable to be processed.  Securing the United States food supply is a vital national interest for us all."

The greed and hypocrisy of CEOs all the way up to the Orange-Tinted President of the United Pork Barrel Futures of America is palpable.

Of course it makes no sense and treats the workers badly, but this is the MO of the administration.  Trump cares only about himself and getting reelected.

I’m sure these employees have drummed into them how lucky they are to have work. No, they’re not.  This feels like hell on earth.  These people need to be paid a lot more money.  I have a feeling Tyson executives do quite well.  Everyone else is exploited and “lucky to have a job.”  This “industry” treats the animals like machine parts instead of living, breathing beings who both love and feel pain.   They are viciously confined, have their babies brutally yanked away from them and often killed.  Just go to Farm Sanctuary and you and see how much joy these animals feel, their connections with each other and their caretakers. Then we have these poor employees who are treated badly, make little money and probably feel sick as well.  This is wrong.  At a time like this, can’t we reexamine what we are doing instead of rationalizing it because it’s so easy for us to do that, and ignore the suffering that we goes on but pretend it’s not happening because we don’t see it?  The worst thing about human beings is that we can rationalize anything, no matter how cruel, when we personally benefit.  Let’s stop that."

Whenever I see the word ""Tyson"" on a package, I already move along.  When I see that word, I see stressed out animals full of Cortisol and pumped full of more hormones than a bodybuilder, and workers making around $5 an hour so a handful of stockholders can get rich.  If I simply walk over to the Halal section of the meat counter and look at chickens, the difference is obvious. 

Companies that look after their employees during this crisis rather than their own stockholders will get my business going forward.  Those that treat their employees the same way they treat their caged chickens will not get my money.  

I read how the CEO of Columbia Sportswear cut his pay to $10,000 per year to keep paying employees to stay home.  He didn't want to start laying off his staff.  I need a new raincoat.  I wonder who will get my business?  The vice-president of Amazon quit over the working conditions.  Will I order from Jeff?  Nope!  He already has enough money to last his family for the next 100 generations.  

People, shop like your lives depended on it because where you spend your dollars is far more important than who you vote for."

When the bird flu jumps to humans (as it has in China) the mortality rate is 60 percent.  We scream about the wet markets in China but we have our own version of them all over the US.

Brown and black immigrants are disposable like drill bits in the mining industries. Companies use them up until they’re no longer productive. They are not treated as human beings; they are treated as any other inanimate capital investment. 

Meat packing plants are what keep us from achieving our potential as human beings. They are cruel and sadistic. They are disgusting and they degrade us all. Animals and humans are treated so inhumanly and grotesquely. The living creatures (humans and “meat” animals) are demolished and destroyed to get the meat to market in a snazzy looking can, or under a plastic wrapper, all nice and neat, belying the murderous methods used to deliver that pork chop, chicken quarter, or ground beef.

Iowa's Republican governor, Reynolds, said that it was  the workers responsibility to prove that a plant was unsafe, not the company's responsibility to prove that it was indeed safe. 

There are a number of exceptions allowed for not returning, such as testing positive or being ill.

The only difference between this and slavery is the pay.  The attitude of the owners, the surrounding society of Republican politicos and judges, and the way they talk is identical to Pre-Lincolnian slavery in the South.  America needs to be ashamed at what the so-called ""heartland"" has become.  Man's inhumanity to man is now firmly embedded in the Republican Party and their supposedly god-fearing supporters.

2020-05-10 21:19:31,"I was raised in a ranching community. The cattle producers and ranchers I grew up with would like nothing more than to see the breakup of the “Big Four” packing giants for sake of food security, animal welfare, and employee safety. It was well intentioned food safety regulation (passed mainly because of the sins of the large processing plants) that led to the demise of local butchers and allowed the market to consolidate into the hands of these agri-giants.

These packers care little for animal well-being or for American cattle producers on the bottom rung of the system. They oppose country of origin labeling, and welcome any opportunity to import Brazilian beef that is cheaper for their bottom line (cheaper due lack of environmental and safety oversight). 

It’s easy to say “stick it to ‘em and don’t eat meat,” but in doing so these agri-giants are not hurt so much as are the generation of progressive ranchers who practice holistic resource management and strive to be in harmony with this country’s grasslands and sage-steppe. If you want to stick it to the Big Four, amend federal meat inspection regulation to enable small butchers and packers to be able to resale meat to local restaurants, stores and consumers. Create secondary markets that are regional and local to take away the market share from the giants. Transition from a system focused on calloused killing for the sake of volume and sales, to one where we are intimately connected to our food and where it comes from."

In fact, eating cholesterol-packed animal products is a leading factor in heart disease, America's other leading killer. Processed meat has officially been declared a carcinogen by the World Health Organization. Because animals eat SO much more than they produce as food, meat is a leading cause of world hunger. It's also a big factor in climate change, habitat destruction and wildlife extinction. And, of course, there are those pesky zoonotic diseases to think about, like COVID-19 and mad cow disease, to name just two. Americans need to wake up and face the truth about this nightmarish industry. Eat something else. For starters, how about vegetables, grains, nuts and fruit?

You then have 120,000 extra hogs backed up. It's a tight margin business and no one wanted that much extra livestock hanging around. 
That's just Waterloo. There are a dozen other ""food factories"" scattered throughout the state, as well as in Nebraska, S. Dakota, Indiana, that have faced the same problem. In each instance, farmers have won out over workers, who just happen to all be immigrants."

Trump himself likened the fight to beat COVID-19 to a war. Yet he window-dresses a draft of the poor, the minorities and  undocumented through an executive order.  Our heroes are the people he despises.

It was disgusting how an animal had been force fed to reach this obscene weight. Seeing that animal up close made something click in my heart and my brain. It was a living creature, not simply some pork chops and bacon.

People should not eat any food or buy any product unless they are intimately familiar with how it is produced.

When the means of production is hidden from us, whether it is the caging of animals, their method of slaughter, or the lives of people working in or living near plastics factories, or the backbreaking work of farm laborers or garbage pickers finding materials to recycle, that means we might change our consumer choices if we knew the truth.

The top of the news from Germany yesterday and the day before was the closure of several slaughterhouses and ""meat packing plants"" because of discovery of hundreds of people testing positive for Covid 19. In Germany too the workforce in these places is foreign, in Germany it is eastern European and they apparently often live in crowded communal housing created for them. The slaughterhouses and packing plants have been closed for now. In Germany the relaxation of Covid restrictions are dependent on keeping new infections in a state or community low and so these plants are effecting the states and communities around them and endangering the return to work of many others. So there isn't a call to reopen them. But in Germany too vocal groups of citizens are demanding that businesses re-open. I wish that I could watch the news from France or Italy in their languages but I can't and I wonder if similar things are happening there too.

I honestly didn’t even know I could get meat locally until all this happened, and it certainly seems like a much better option than these meat factories for a number of reasons. For instance, it supports the local economy, there’s very little in the way of transportation costs and associated environmental impact, there’s a significantly lesser chance of food contamination due to exposure along transport routes (particularly in communities that are good about distancing and taking proper cautionary and sanitation measures), etc.

I would also be very surprised if the virus didn’t survive in meat—after all, the living things it infects are literally made of the stuff, and all the workers who were sick were handling the meats and packaging them...

Kudlow and Mnuchin both say they will hold back with more money because they haven’t seen enough of it circulating. They rushed to give most of it to big businesses who have nothing yet to use it in a manner that can circulate and have left most unemployed people and small businesses without any of the money which means they are probably without money to spend. I think that they are incapable of seeing what’s there to see that is impeding economic activity. 

These guys watch capital and interest rates and unemployment rates as if they are measures relevant to economic performance under deliberately suspended economic activity. 

The circumstances which matter are how those who cannot earn a living due to the pandemic are being supported and assured of reimbursements to savings spent to be able to carry on until they are allowed to resume supporting themselves. Only a silly person would call this emergency support economic stimulus. Stimulus money accelerates producing, selling, and buying goods and services to expand the economy.

This farm does not feed their animals antibiotics to make them grow, and they treat their animals humanely which is not true for Tyson, Smithfield or Cargill.

2020-05-11 14:27:42,"The problem here is that social distancing is not enforced no matter how hard we try, the simple fact is, some people just don’t care.  Social distancing is extremely important, even more so in the meat producing facilities such as this one because if one person gets it, they not only can transmit it to other people, but also to the products.  Say a pork chop is infected, it gets shipped to a hannaford, then a father picks up groceries and the entire family eats this tainted food for dinner.  Now, what was supposed to be a dinner for four, turns into the infection and possible death of four.  The fact that Tyson hadn’t already put strict social distancing/face mask and glove restrictions put in place before is honestly absurd.  If you are one of the largest sources of meat for the United States, you shouldn’t have to wait to be corrected.  It’s your responsibility to make sure every product gets distributed correctly/safely, nobody else’s.  If we continue down this path of not caring/shrugging things off, why bother putting social distancing/face mask and glove rules in effect at all?"
2020-05-11 14:32:09,"While Tyson may not be the only one, they still aren't working to protect their employees. '“We’re making sure that the work force is protected and, most importantly, that we’re keeping that food supply chain moving,” Ms. Reynolds said.  This is embarrassing to read as an American that we are choosing pork chops over people.  ""They had not slowed the line down. They were not practicing any sort of social distancing.”  I think this article gives me motivation to buy meat locally.  Why feed into a large company that doesn't really care about human lives.  We should be buying meat from local farms where animals and humans are treated well."

""Most importantly""--more important than protecting the workers--we continue to process pork. This statement is outrageous and alarming. Families of Tyson employees should not have to live without their loved ones just so people can eat their pork chops and Tyson can make a profit. I have lived without eating any meat for 25 years. It can be done, especially to save lives."

The days of company pensions are long gone.  If anything, COVID-19 has exposed some of the big holes in our social safety net, and they're getting larger by the day.  How many people have anything left over, after the necessities of rent and food, to invest in the future?  More than you know.

Investors live on a different world than the rest of us but that may soon change and quickly. Typical investors don’t do their own grocery shopping for example.

And not just toilet paper anymore. You can’t find bread, flour, certain snacks, even milk sometimes. This is serious folks. This is America not Iran.

At the moment the big companies are paying far less taxes, as they should. The money the treasury and Fed spent (mostly on the big companies), will without adequate economic activity, lead to inflation. Inflation must be controlled by taxation. People without a job can't be taxed, and the middle class has already the bulk of the taxes to shoulder. They can't pay more. So it's finally up to the biggies to pay their share. And this will drastically reduce profits and ultimately stock value."
2020-05-11 19:01:23,"When I got in the investment business in 1977 as an equity research analyst for a well-regarded trust department, there was still an evident linkage between publicly-held stocks and the economy: households would save, those savings would either be channeled through commercial banks into corporations' working capital (i.e., inventories and receivables) or through investment banks into corporations' property, plant and equipment (by means of stocks and bonds).  That linkage existed through many of my years as a analyst on Wall Street.  But the growth of savings over the past several decades combined with decreasing capital needs of large corporations (offshore sourcing combining with the inherent lower capital requirements of service industries) to waterboard the markets with literally more capital than they knew what to do with.

By 2008, when the markets shifted to financing mortgages (and their associated derivatives) and the percentage of the total market value for financial companies exceeded 20% of the market total, the breakdown was complete - financial services had become financial masters.  The dead giveaway was the use of shareholders' equity for buybacks - using 2/3rds of the S&P 500's reported earnings over the past 12 years.  The system that had worked so well in the 1950s-1980s was and is completely broken.

Wildcat strikes are on the rise, along with social instability.

Now, Trump is demanding that workers go back to their assembly-line positions so that companies can keep earning profits and paying out stock dividends to the ownership class. A 20% unemployment rate means better leverage for employers, lower wages—more money for the company.

President Trump, most Republican politicians, and the syncophantic, corporate media deliberately conflate stock market gains with economic progress - to distract Americans from their ongoing impoverishment.  

For decades American have been beggared as wealth has been hyper-concentrated among the few.  Corporations - coupled with ""soft"" political corruption - provide the means for this theft while many Americans are distracted by cultural warfare and entertainment.

Any democratic government that would serve all Americans must reverse this destruction of public goods for private gain. 

Any government for and by the people must strip power and tax corporate wealth to (re)create public goods like high quality universal health care and education.

The stock market is an indirect gage of economic activity on the assumption that money invested (stocks bought) will be used to create productive businesses.  That assumption has not been the case for a long time, and has been patently untenable since 2008.

My understanding is that investors pay lower marginal taxes on dividends and capital gains (23.8%) then an average wage worker does for social security and income taxes (29.5%). If the average wage worker instead made an equivalent amount of dividends or capital gains ($50,000) they would pay 0% federal income tax.

Lower taxes used to be argued that investors were rewarded for risk taking, but diversified investors have now proven both in 2008 and today that they have no downside risk (the federal government and treasury paid trillions to keep the stock market high) but as we now see workers have everything to loose (unemployment above 25%) including their life.

Investors claim they are the ""Job Creators""; yet 70% of our economy is consumption by these employees and we see what happens when every employee stops working to the economy......

Maybe its time to reevaluate the idea that Investors ""give"" us jobs and risk there money in exchange for tax breaks. Perhaps its time we raise taxes on these 10% Investors so the 90% of ""essential"" workers are protected with public healthcare and national unemployment. This would prevent congress having to scramble and poorly deploy the public purse in times of crisis."

The beneficiaries would be free to spend those dollars in whatever manner they wished - pay off a mortgage, or purchase a car, clothes, food, etc. The economy would revive, because this 80% of wage earners needs to spend the money, not hoard it as currently happens at the higher income levels.

The problem with this country is that the top 20% of wage earners have never paid their fair share - not since the 1950's. That's all that is needed - some fairness."

The fact was and is, a lot of Americans are so strung out financially that they can't go without cash flow for more than a week. A lot of Americans are serfs, debt slaves or worse.  All you need to do is observe how deep the crisis was for millions of Americans when the contagion brought things to a standstill. So this is the economic reality for a lot of people. 

I can't understand why millions of Americans use the stock market to judge the success of a president, especially when there is a total disconnect between what the market does and how people live their daily lives.

Because the Fed has pushed historically cheap liquidity into the market and has in effect back-stopped loses for the investor class and public corporations, thereby encouraging stock buybacks at the expense of investments in their businesses, workers and R&D, which further obscures the anemic earnings performance of corporate America. And all with no conditionality or modicum of relief to unemployed or working Americans.

4. Wealth inequality has been going up on average since about 1973 especially since 2008. No matter how you measure wealth inequality, practically all of the gains in wealth have gone to the Rich since 2008.

5. We have had 7 devastating financial crises in the US, in 1819, 1837, 1857, 1873, 1893, 1929, and 2008. ALL of them were preceded by a period in which the federal government was in the hands of ""financial responsible"" people. It did not spend enough or taxed too much. The federal deficit which puts money INTO the private sector was less than the trade deficit which takes money OUT. People et al turned to banks to borrow. The banks became overextended. The economy fell off a cliff. Thus 1929 was just part of a pattern."

If the economy doesn't soon turn around the impact on earnings will be even more pronounced.

Yes, giants like Microsoft and Amazon are actually benefiting from the Pandemic and one could also say that so are the largest of the financial industry and Wall Street even as average Americans and small businesses are going to be financially wiped out.

Kind of reminds me of the outcome of 2008.  Giant bailouts for the TBTF, limited stimulus, the Big 5 TBTF come out smelling like roses with record profits and millions lose their homes, their life savings, the Biden Bankruptcy bill kicks in and most people can't claim a clean slate on their credit because Chapter 7 is almost impossible for unless you are desolate, in which case you can't even afford a lawyer to file for Chapter 7.  

The next thing is we are back to debtors prisons and work houses.  Remind you of ""The Scrooge"" or perhaps a ""A Christmas Carol?""

Now the Fed is also buying munis and other forms of state/local government debt which in my opinion has created a giant house of cards. How many more headlines can we read about the current depression level economy continuing for years to come but the markets keep rising ?  How many more articles can we read that the US is losing its place atop the financial world before other countries are going to stop using dollars to prop up their lousy economies ?

This is America, too. I lived in LA.  I've seen how people live between Japantown and the Garment District. Not much better than the shanty towns, just less.  Countries with clearly two economies, two realities. And if you are born to the bottom, you have nearly no hope. In those countries, and the USA.

The Dow is on the front page of every newspaper, listed on every news site, on the chyron of every tv station, stock tracking apps come preinstalled on phones... If the Dow isn’t the most important metric then why do we elevate it to such heights?

Is there a single chart that can measure the markets, changes in purchase power parity, income gap and wealth distribution, GDP, GNP, unemployment, etc. to see how “the economy” is doing? And if not, can we instead have wealth distribution or wage gaps shown to us on a daily basis the same way the Dow is?

I would imagine a lot of people who are claiming we have the “greatest economy ever,” wouldn’t think so if they looked away from the Dow and towards our growing inequality and the fact we now have the highest income gap in the developed world. If American's had a chart which every day and at every turn showed a steady trending downward line representing the average citizen's life is not financially better off - despite record high corporate profits - we would not need articles such as this."

While I mostly agree with this piece, in typical NYT style, the fact that so many of us ""perceive"" the stock market as a reflection of the economy is presented as some sort of causeless phenomenon, rather than the result of a coordinated public relations project (with a big assist from media outlets like the NYT) to convince people that it's the case. As NPR breathlessly tracks the ups and downs during our daily commutes, and papers across the country take it as a given that 5% drop as ""major news,"" can you blame someone working full-time to support a family for coming to the conclusion?"

2020-05-11 20:52:47,"""In fact, a relatively small number of wealthy families own the vast majority of the shares controlled by U.S. households.""

This is naive and incorrect. The vast majority of shares are not ""controlled"" by US households; they are owned by households and pensions.  In fact, what matters is that the vast majority of shares ARE controlled by professionals - asset managers like PIMCO, Fidelity, Berkshire Hathaway, Calpers; hedge funds ""rent"" shares for a few minutes; family offices - which are a combination of hedge fund and asset manager; foreign institutions are also big players. Consider the asset manager to be the ""house"" and will always win; households, not so much.

The point being that the ""owners"" are paying very little attention and have less understanding of what the control entities are doing. Owners may get a quarterly report but  generally are looking on an annual basis. In any event, these reports are meant to obscure rather than enlighten. If the owners actually cared, paid attention (research and understood) to what and why the owned) an asset and acted in their best interests, the markets would be meaningful. 

Would negative rates really make sense? Would startups without assets except an idea and a business plan really be worth billions?

To me the ""Economy"" is the number of people chasing goods and services.  A good economy has lots of people chasing discretionary goods and services. If half the people in a society do not have discretionary money, my personal opinion is that it is not a ""good"" economy.  If half the population cannot handle a sudden $400 hit, that is poor form.
The Stock Market can do well if the sellers get their business model right.  Small margins on mass sales, like food. Ripping consumers and government off like Big Pharma and HC insurers. And discretionary, which does not have to produce for everyone, but only for those with money. That is what a lot of businesses do, sell only to the upper 30% or so who can afford it.  Everyone else lives at Goodwill.  The modern American Economy is built to accommodate inequality.  Crony capitalism works for more transfer of wealth from poor to rich, so it will continue."

Also, no one seems to take into account that the algorithms used to buy and sell stocks don't understand the conflicting facts that come at us each day during this pandemic.  How can a computer program understand that even if a government official says reopen (which made the market go up) people are just going to stay home because it is safer or that ""reopen"" does not mean 100%?

2020-05-11 21:05:48,"Economists and policy makers have perpetuated this mythology.  More emphasis is given to the way the stock market behaves than to how Main Street is doing.  I don't recall a time when the stock market wasn't considered a proxy for the well being of the American economy. Using as such has led to cutbacks in unemployment benefits, unwise decisions on interest rates, and more.  Our salaries, bonuses, benefits, indeed our lives have been subjected to the whims of the stock market.  CEOs make decisions based upon short term gains rather than long term aims.  People are downsized on the basis of one bad quarter.

I think what is not said clearly enough is how many lives have been ruined because of the stock markets ups and downs.  Most of us have no stake in it but time and again in the last 50 years lives and livelihoods have been destroyed because of how it's behaved or how some rogue company has acted.  What this article should state as well is that there is no there there.  What's good for a large multinational or national corporation has not been good for Americans.

Liberals decry capitalism and conservatives decry socialism when the truth is something more akin to soviet central planning and/or financial fascism. Economic fundamentals will matter, eventually, though. 
Soviet-style central planning never works, long term because it is too slow, too expensive, simultaneously simplistic and complex, arbitrary and capricious, and driven by institutional inertia and nepotism. It is a system that virtually assures a bankrupt government and an impoverished people."

There is no formula that connects them, of course, but if you look at a graph of stock prices for say the last 100 years, it's very easy to pick out the recessions.

Aggregate corporate revenue is of course tied to the GDP of the US and other nations.  And revenue to related to profits and profits are related to equity price.

2020-05-11 21:53:37,"“Stock ownership among the middle class is pretty minimal,” said Ed Wolff, an economist at New York University"" - but just because the middles doesn't own a lot of stock doesn't mean that the stock market's health does not affect the middle class. Pension funds are heavily invested in the stock market, and the overwhelming majority of public sector workers and union workers are covered in a pension plan. And even for those those middle class families without a pension fund, many live in states and/or municipalities that have enormous public pension systems. Should the stock market crash the jurisdictions will have to cover the pension pay outs by pulling money from public services that include schools, police, prisons, and roads (to name just a few; all of which also provide jobs). And if people's pensions go bust and they can't afford to retire , they will hang on to their middle class jobs out of necessity, and the lack of attrition will mean that younger folks won't be able to move into middle class jobs as they should. Thus, it would seem to me that the reporter's premise is flawed. The fate of the middle class is most definitely is tied to the health of the stock market to a significant degree, and all of us are truly are all better off the stock market holds it value. The market remains one (not the only) indicator of economic health. Right now the market is OK, and I suggest we not squash this tiny kernel of good news."
2020-05-11 21:20:40,"I will certainly agree that there is no one-to-one relationship between stock market performance and economic activity.

Classic analysis instructs that a firm's stock price generally reflects the overall market participants collective belief of a particular company's future expected performance.  What's known is already discounted in the price.  Only what is expected, but yet to be realized is what is priced in.

But given that dicta, we should be very concerned that market participants are trading on uninformed, possibly manipulated, and definitely optimistic expectations of future performance.

Heretofore, it appears that most market participants are trading on the basis of an expected ""V"" economic recovery.  And if this is indeed the case, the current share prices are generally correct.  They simply anticipate a sharp one or two quarter ""recession"" that will negatively impact short-term cash flow but that will be offset by a relatively quick rebound.

But what if we are experiencing a more likely ""U"" or even ""L"" recession?  Something that may be likely with 20% unemployment.   Then current market expectations are clearly misplaced.

And if this is, in fact, the case we can then expect a considerable stock market correction (or even crash) relatively soon.

Add in the possibility of market manipulation (i.e. a classic ""pump and dump"" by market movers) and you will see all hell break loose.  In particular since the pre-Covid market already was ripe for a large correction."

Like anything else, there are only so many quality assets to go around...i.e. blue chip tech stocks, homes in desirable neighborhoods, artwork, collector cars, etc. The prices of these things goes up not only because of inflation but because so many people with cheap money are seeking yield because putting in the bank will get you nothing. So stocks are going up because there is no where else to put money. These big institutions have to chase yield.  This time around the big banks and the elites are going to finish what they failed to finish the last time...monopolizing any asset worth buying to the detriment of everyone else.

On April 9th the Fed announced that under the SMCCF program will add EVEN junk bonds and junk bond ETFs to items purchased by the Fed. 

Stock prices are set by demand and supply and when the Federal Reserve  prints money to support the market, down to the purchase of junk bonds the stock market rises

With zero minimum, zero commission mutual funds, even someone with just $100 to invest can still gain $10 when the market goes up by 10%.

Of course, the rich get more returns in absolute dollar terms, as they, by definition, have more money to put in to start with. But, it's still proportional.

2020-05-11 23:34:11,"If the stock market mirrored the economy, stock prices on average would go up about the same as GDP. Some stocks would outperform and some would underperform. But investors expect the value of their portfolios to increase several times the growth in GDP. How is that possible? In part it is achieved by lowering wages, reducing workforce and shipping jobs to low wage countries which redistributes the GDP to the top increasing wealth and income disparity. But it also achieved through speculative buying which grossly inflates the value of companies. When the market threatens to reflect economic reality, investors expect the government and taxpayers to step in to protect their speculative gains.

By June 1, 1932, it had rollercoastered down another 83 percent.

Since Reagan we've had a supply-side, ""trickle down"" economic system, designed to focus on maximizing profits and minimizing expenses like worker pay and benefits. One part of this was offshoring manufacturing and services and the jobs that they provide. Another part was to switch the focus from creating things to sell to making money out of investments that don't create anything. This is why Wall St. booms and Main St. sinks. Even now, as Congress creates bail outs, these are aimed at pushing money to the top and expecting it to ""trickle down"" to those who need it most - exactly the WRONG approach. Instead of worrying that corporations and Wall St. won't make profits, they need to make sure consumers that make up 70% of the economy have money to spend and not go bankrupt.

The other false statistic that needs to be ignored is the 'unemployment numbers' which don't accurately describe the employment and wage reality of Americans. A better number would be average wage growth adjusted for inflation, and average wage of jobs created. These would show how badly workers have been treated for decades.

Our financial advisor, who works for Merrill Lynch, keeps pushing stocks as a necessary investment.  I can't say that's exactly worked well for us.  With CD's at a quarter percent and money market at 0.01 percent, our investment choice today is Serta, as in the mattress manufacturer.

By pumping massive liquidity into the market, the money had to go somewhere.  Banks weren't going to use that capital on Main Street, so they put it to work on Wall Street.   The market would reflect reality if the Fed wasn't so busy propping up the market and let prices reflect reality.   By letting rates approach 0, just about any price in the market can be justified.  Welcome to casino capitalism.   It is a sad day for those of us who believe that the stock market can be an important cog in the capitalistic system, instead of just a gambling hall."

Having said that, if the stock market, as this author attests, is almost exclusively for the haves, and has fewer ordinary Americans participating than ever, then how in the world can it be healthy for and a driver of democracy."
2020-05-12 01:06:08,"Yes, the stock market is not a measure of the overall general economy, especially as any kind of indicator of any kind of societal wealth and well being.  

But perhaps one reason Americas believe it is important is because we hear stock market reports every hour on the hour on many radio stations, read the up-&-down stock market numbers prominently posted in daily newspapers, and see it often on Internet websites on our digital devices.

Maybe we should be hearing more about the daily Gini Index (as a measure of family income inequality), where the U.S. ranks poorly in the world and partially explains why the wealth gap between middle and working classes versus the mighty rich 1%, who keep getting richer while their tax rate keeps getting lower.

Plus, the Wall Street these days is less about big manufacturing corporations that provide lots of jobs and make tangible products than about the mysterious financial industry that makes no products, doesn't have lots of jobs, but derives its wealth for investors by moving money around in fancy investment schemes.

Lots of smoke and mirrors in this country, and considerable effort is being made by the right-wing capitalists to condition the public mind that facts, truth, evidence, and reality don't matter.  Trump's reelection depends on it.  

So we are all fine folks as long as the stock market is up and the government makes it so by transferring taxpayer money to it in a variety of ways."

Today we see the diversification of multinational economic power, and a continual mutability throughout the world of global leaders. Materials oriented complexes, such as agriculture, forestry, metals and chemicals are all distinguished in this diversification. Changes in energy sources, modes of transportation, and the division of labor also add to the picture. Finally, our ""made in America"" strengths, then attributed to our cultural melting pot, and more likely seen in the United States of 1962 as a blending of religious heterogamy and the further integration of European heritage, are today reduced to social and educational blocs more easily associated with city/rural, black/white, rich/poor and this is especially pronounced through the lens of the political spectrum."

What is QDEL? QDEL is an Inc. that began in 1979 with private sales of complement components and expensive kits to assay complement system (CS)activity. They had a monopoly on being one of the 1st Inc to sell purified complement components. What is CS? CS is the ever ready 1st line of ferocious defense against germs. It is also a double edged sword and if unregulated it can cause autoimmune damage to ones own tissues and organs. My Ph.D. student was working on determining whether a protein I co-discovered at NIAID, NIH was capable of blocking the complement activity of the amyloid fibrils in Alzheimer's which were known to activate the complement activity and the damaging inflammatory response. Thats when Quidel came into the picture. In 2000s, Quidel started selling diagnostic kits and became public.

Well, needless to say my glory days behind the wheel, thinking I was going to be the next Stirling Moss of farmers came to an almost tragic end.  I turned the wheel when I shouldn't have and the tractor began to tip on its side.  Fortunately, there was a long and wide rock pile on the right side which probably saved my life because it blocked the tractor from completely tipping over on itside.

My mother came running out behind my dad to see if I was okay.  As my dad began to come towards me, yelling and swearing at me for being stupid, my mother ran in between us to protect me and just picked me up and took me to the farmhouse.  She kept apologizing to me for not knowing what I was doing because she was busy doing the wash and baking bread.

Bottom line is that a maturity level is missing in many, many kids. They may have the book smarts, but maturity and street and traffic smarts comes with age.

If this was a decision that only affected the kid and he immediate family, I would agree with Kemp's decision. However, driving impacts all of us, and I don't trust the judgement of some of the parents in this state; some parents are concerned more about their comfort than about the safety of everyone else (e.g. going out into public with no mask because they find it ""inconvenient"").

I've had my permit for two years, I won't be allowed to drive uninsured, and my parents were super involved in teaching me how to drive. I understand that waiving the road test poses serious concerns about safety, but I think that before people jump to conclusions they should consider that there are some of us that would have passed the test anyways. Georgia's pass rate for teen drivers is already super high and the minimum pass score is a 75%. I know I'm not the best driver, but with this I can gain experience that will make me a better driver.

We have an elderly friend who is legally blind who still has a license, but thankfully her children talked her into selling her car.  I have been rear-ended twice by young drivers who weren't paying attention, and was stopped at a red light both times.  Lots of senseless damage.  Kids need to learn, but it should be under supervision and an expert should decide when they're ready to solo.

2020-05-09 10:29:14,"Miss the remaining real/authentic New York shops and restaurants, the ones that have not been decimated by luxurifucation/gentrification. Most will not survive this.

Miss being able to walk.

Miss going to Fairway without thinking about Covid.

Miss riding MTA buses

Don’t miss the wealthy who fled to the Hamptons -  hoping they will not return."
2020-05-09 10:31:32,"At the top of the list have to be hair salons and barbershops.  Staring at the grays and dealing with the overly long, unruly hair are a reminder of us being cut off from the routines that kept us feeling human."
2020-05-09 11:03:26,"The three big drivers of NYC life/economy are now damaged beyond repair.  That is, finance/WS/RE...the once lively restaurant scene... and tourism.  Gone, kaput. People who have the ability will leave the densely packed eastern seaboard cities.  Stay, and risk your life?  Life of the children? Nope.  Expect a huge adjustment(downward) for RE prices. I  frequently visit a son in Austin.  There you can sit outside, comfortably for about 8 months of the year, at a coffee place or beer garden that can be a couple of acres in size.  I know...it gets HOT in Austin. Reasonable distancing is possible. Even if a vaccine becomes available, the anti-vax crowd will have none of that.  ""Make me""! Plus any vaccine will not  be 100% effective as we see with the current flu vaccine.  ""Freedom loving"" (sic-k) Americans will keep this pandemic rolling for a long, long time."
2020-05-09 11:12:06,"Things we would miss after this is over: The peaceful relatively quiet outside, the singing of the birds heard loud and clear at all times of day and night, the constant hoot of daytime owls (it seems there's one on every block!), the cleaner air, that have never felt that sweet before, and the disappearance of those allergies."
2020-05-09 11:16:31,"I miss pasta at Barbuto (the old AND the new location, where we were lucky enough to snag a table on the second night). I miss running out to get an iced coffee on a warm spring afternoon, breaking up the workday with a jolt of java and city street energy. I miss Hudson River Park, the lights of Hoboken twinkling across the water and One World Trade rising from the far end of the park, bathed in sunset light. I miss the Union Square Farmers Market, filled with every kind of fruit and vegetable and cheese and honey - the plenty of the earth in the middle of a concrete square. I miss taking Tucker to the dog park, chatting with the other dog people, and watching him romp happily with his friends in the sun. I lived in NYC during 9/11...I know it will come back. Please make it soon, Big Apple. We love you ♥️ 🍎"
2020-05-09 11:25:11,"I miss the sensibilities of those who write and comment on stories like this. Thanks, and see you soon."
2020-05-09 11:31:20,"I’m extremely sad about all the lost lives, ruined businesses and the financial distress that so many are experiencing.  And I terribly miss being able to hug my adult daughter and her puppy.  But there is something incredibly peaceful about the amazing quiet, lack of traffic and cleaner air.  Also, the new normal of cooking meals at home every night is actually pretty nice. It will be interesting to see whether any positive long-term 
changes emerge from all this."
2020-05-09 11:32:18,"Clark’s coffee shop.  Elephant and Castle.  But you know, maybe they’ll be back when this is over, still as unchanged as they have been in the last 30  years."
2020-05-09 11:27:10,I miss sushi. sigh.
2020-05-09 10:32:00,Reading the Metropolitan Diary column (Mondays) has provided an interim whiff and glimpse of New York City life. Sorely missed.
2020-05-09 11:02:41,What I don't miss.  I don't miss all the tourists! I don't miss the filthy disgusting streets that have recently plagued our city.  Maybe its a great time to pave our streets and give our beloved city a good scrub down.
2020-05-09 11:30:27,"I miss waking up at sunrise and looking out my windows over the city and knowing a whole day lay before me, as limitless as the colors of the rising sun illuminating my apartment."
2020-05-09 11:44:16,"New York City now and always is, and always has been, what each of us makes it every day, and every day each of us and her/his New York is re-born."
2020-05-09 11:48:35,"I miss the crowds at Zabars, weaving in and out of the aisles with my shopping basket in my hand and furtively noticing what delights others have in theirs. I miss coming out of the subway at 14th Street and Union Square to the masses of people hurrying in all directions or just sitting on benches enjoying the sun.  I miss rubbing elbows with other book lovers at the Strand and finding that hidden treasure on the remainder table. I miss taking the 6 train to Canal Street to buy fresh produce in Chinatown and stopping for lunch in my favorite hole in the walk on East Broadway. Although New Yorkers say they never go there, I miss walking down to Time Square on a hot, summer evening just to take in the energy and the crowds and then walk back up Broadway to 82nd Street and home, passing all of humanity crowded together in this amazing city I call home.  I miss it, and I'll still be here when my city returns."
2020-05-09 11:49:40,"I miss the Met Museum and Opera, and the Phil.

I did not miss the scary bikers on the sidewalks, back again, or the ones going in the wrong direction, also back. 

I'll miss the clean air and blue skies and some of the quiet.

I miss not thinking every person I saw on the street is toxic.  This is worse than the time of HIV"
2020-05-09 11:55:46,"Originally from L.I., would visit my children living in NYC several times a year. I miss picking up a coffee and a danish at Hot n Crusty and enjoying the early morning ride up the Hudson, across the GWB and north on the Palisades as I headed home."
2020-05-09 11:56:14,"I miss taking NJTransit to Penn Station, walking across to the 34th street ferry and taking it to North Williamsburg and live out all the foodie desires at Smorgasburg then heading back.
And perusing Brooklyn Flea
And the Other Art Fair
And any place that serves up real hummus, falafel, shakshuka
And the Met
And Prospect Park
And Coney Island
And Washington Square Park
And Strand
And just feeling alive, surrounded by others trying to find an escape.
I moved up to this area from South Jersey and this whole pandemic has made me realize that I found my place to stay and set roots in for good...I want my future kids to experience all this area has to offer and will offer in the future."
2020-05-09 11:56:54,"I miss the freedom to walk anywhere in the city.
Alone in my dreamy solitude yet together with a diverse community of people.
I miss the Metropolitan Museum and  my  visual encounters with my friends - the great paintings and sculptures. Walking through the Temple of  Dendur,
resting in a Chinese courtyard  with rock formations and koi fish in a small pond, and gazing at Diana by Saint-Gaudens through bright sunlight near the American Wing. I miss the High Line and the art galleries and all the little restaurants and cafes that were crowded with people but served delicious meals. In short, I miss everything and yearn for the impossibility of a return to what was, because in my opinion that was what made New York New York."
2020-05-09 12:01:27,"No wonder the pain of New Yorker's sense of loss is so acute. Samuel Johnson might also have been speaking of New York City (if in 1750 it bore any semblance to the indispensable city it's since become) when he remarked in one of his most famous quips, 'Sir, When a man is tired of London, he's tired of life.'"
2020-05-09 12:02:24,"Strange, but I was kind of rejoicing as I traversed East 9th then East 11th Street yesterday. I feel we old timers finally have our dear, sweet, hyper local 1990s era East Village back. I am soaking it all up while it lasts."
2020-05-09 12:08:49,"I miss live theater. There’s nothing like it. When it’s good, it makes me tear up. I miss exploring different neighborhoods and browsing. New York is always interesting, never boring! And I miss my friends."
2020-05-09 12:11:27,I do not miss the hot dog carts outside the Met.
2020-05-09 12:12:17,"I lived in NYC from 1974-1988 and try to visit at least once a year.  Such a great city.  So glad I visited in Nov 2019 - weekend of Marathon.  It was a beautiful weekend - we went to a play, walked on the High Line, visited the newly reopened MoMA, visited a 90 yr old friend, ate out (of course),  and just walked around.  I hope NYC will come back for the residents and visitors."
2020-05-09 12:15:36,"I’m a native New Yorker, almost 70. Something happened here beyond our control & it’s shedding light on work that has to be done. Things that already needed changing. How we’re going to address these issues is the question. Homelessness, healthcare inequity, sanitation, education. & by the way the Union Square Farmers Market is still open for business. The loss of life & of jobs & income is staggering. Thinking about being on the subway every day the week before the shutdown is frightening. But the present day city everyone describes missing was built slowly by dreamers & riskers one little noodle shop and off off off Broadway show at a time. Let’s get the science right & then bring back the ballet and the ferries, the baseball and the long walks to nowhere & everywhere. In 1969 it was unfathomable that I would miss my local Pho shop in 2020. What new places and people will be “New York?” I can’t wait to see."
2020-05-09 12:15:51,"For people down on present-day NYC, I visited for the first time in my life in 2010 and it was magical for me -- Central Park walks every day, the Library, bus tours, Broadway show, subway ride, Ellis Island, Wall St., Chelsea, I saw most of it except the burroughs. The magic is still there for tourists despite what you say. I love my Chicago but your city is wonderful, even if I could never afford to live there. Just so you know."
2020-05-09 12:25:14,"This is a nice piece.  I miss the noise.  I remember, as a kid, summers in the Catskills and not being able to fall asleep, because it was so freaky quiet.  All you heard was frogs and crickets.  It scared the wee out of me.

Now, ostensibly an adult, I live in the city.  And the quiet is unnerving.  No rumble of trucks on metal plates over roadwork.  No jackhammers. No school kids shrieking at recess -- little perpetual motion machines that they are. 

Just the occasional sound of auto tires over the road.  And ambulance sirens.  They pierce the solitude.  It scares the wee out of me."
2020-05-09 12:27:25,"I miss my friends. Grabbing a cup of coffee before going to work or a drink after a day in the office. Brunch on a Saturday. Drinks over Zoom just isn't the same.

I miss going to museums, live theater, concerts. This will be the first summer in about 30 years that I will not sit in line for tickets for Shakespeare in the Park.

I almost miss worrying about my teenager going out and not telling me where they are going (""haven't decided yet"") and who they will be with (""not sure""), but not really. I do really hate worrying about their mental state - how stressful virtual school has become, how much they miss their own friends.

I think that most of all, I miss being able to give my mother a hug."
2020-05-09 12:41:42,"As I got older, I finally got tired of all the hassles of living in NYC. And I have no regrets for having moved away. But if you're young, it would be a huge mistake to not live there for a while. The City has lessons to teach that are difficult to learn anywhere else."
2020-05-09 12:42:00,"Yes, all those things are missed, but the peace that reigns in the city now is utterly sublime. For those who remember what it was like in times less frenzied than during the onslaught of the Trump administration, this was a pretty nice place to live, among cool people who knew they were cool and respected and delighted in each other's differences."
2020-05-09 12:44:34,I was just thinking about the skaters and high schoolers at Tompkins today.
2020-05-09 12:44:41,"People under 50 years old that are healthy with a normal BMI (Body Mass Index) will come out in mass after the lock down to do everything they use to do and more.  People over 50 years old with one or more heath issues like high blood pressure, diabetes, higher than normal BMI's, etc. will be much more cautious after the lock down is lifted.  The concern will be in those households where multiple generations of people are living in the same household.  How can we make that work well?"
2020-05-09 12:45:10,"I read once that women in Paris dress for men, that women in LA dress for themselves but women in New York dress for other women. This is a cliche of course and full of presumptions!  I miss the street fashions of all genders parading around for each other and upping everyone’s game. The electric mix of creative people and dynamic pedestrian lifestyle guaranteed wonderful sightings every day. And in what other US city do you run into people you know on the street so often? Those chance encounters make New York life so unpredictable and delightful. I hope the masks we will have to wear for the next year or so will get super creative and we will continue to respect the dedication of healthcare workers by using them."
2020-05-09 12:48:48,"Nostalgia: glasses that allows the wearer to only see what is positive in their past. Most definitely there was much that was positive to see  and experience in pre-Covid NYC and I love living here. 

But let's not pretend that what we miss can humanely be ached for without deciding to make an effort to confront--not just talk about--the severe social problems that covid-19 has made it impossible for us to avoid looking at. 

Let's seek a world where nostalgia can be had with glasses that are not so magical."
2020-05-09 12:51:00,"I miss running on the crowded streets and ending up at the farmer’s market in Union Square. Filling up the little bag that was squished in my pocket with vegetables and flowers that can’t be found in stores. Then hopping on the crowded subway to go back home. Grabbing nova on a poppy bagel with cream cheese and eating half of it as I was walking back home the final stretch.

Our senses have been stunted by this pandemic. Hold tight to the memories and be grateful for these experiences.

We will make new memories and have new experiences. No doubt, they will be different than before. We will adapt...that’s what New Yorkers and humans do best."
2020-05-09 12:51:51,"Thank you for this article. I came to NYC long ago for all of the cultural things that are not available right now. I was a rather shy kid from Pittsburgh, PA who discovered along the way he’s quite the extrovert. I don’t think the city changes you. I think it has always been a kind of magical cauldron that somehow facilitates the emergence of the best and truest essence of a person. I hope we don’t lose that magic with this latest tragic event. We’ve had so many yet we’re all still here, although I think of leaving almost daily now. But really, what other city would continue to mass-congregate nightly to cheer on healthcare workers who they, in the best of all possible worlds, will never meet? It’s truly a special place. 

Signs of hope: a local Chinese restaurant I like just reopened for delivery. The thought of Singapore Mai Fun and Hot and Sour Soup being delivered was like inhaling pure oxygen. I ordered and had to go pick it up from my building’s package room which is new. It smelled delicious and tasted even better. If this keeps up I might have to stay a bit longer!"
2020-05-09 13:00:37,"I recall returning home to Texas after a year in Boston, many years ago. As I drove into SanAntonio, I saw the scrubby landscape that filled me with joy. Why? The exact scent of juniper and dust. The exact shades on green and chalky beige. Maybe not lovely to anyone else, but inexpressibly beautiful to me, even if many memories were not lovely. 

Home is an intangible, something beyond memory, but it is above all, tangible evidence that we ARE. We came from something and we can return. It was faithful to us. 

I feel for anyone who cannot find their way home, especially if they have not left."
2020-05-09 13:10:30,"What New Yorkers miss is the wealthy donating more to the poor. City filled with billionaires should be able to hire 500 restaurants to make food for the hungry 
If each restaurant made 500 meals a day at $10 dollars a meal then 250,000 meals could be made and given away every day with 500 restaurants . At a cost of 2.5 million or 75 million a month. Over 12 months one billion would be spent . NYC is filled with billionaires and the city would come back to life . 
NYC can still recover but the wealthy need to chip  in more."
2020-05-09 13:10:52,"Thank you for this article. It makes us feel as if we are not alone in our emotions.

I do not live in NYC, but am lucky enough to travel there multiple times per year. I miss the small and large things about my own, smaller city- going out for a drink, walking downtown to the water. I also miss NYC- the noise, the feeling of discovery, the Halal Guys, the smell of the inside of a cab. 

Take care of yourself and loved ones. Here's to 2021 being a fresh start!"
2020-05-09 13:11:22,"I miss taking a walk and getting lost in my thoughts and not having to worry about whether the person next to me is too close or not wearing a mask. I also miss human contact. I live alone and have been working from home and drastically limiting my excursions outside. I miss the touch of another human, be it a hug from a loved one or a bump by someone on the subway. As a native NYer who has lived in 3 separate Manhattan neighborhoods over my 55 years, this is my home., always has been, always will be. Not a place I came to, but a place I was born into. Its in my blood."
2020-05-09 13:11:26,"Funny thing about memory, it tends to squish together events into a ""time salad"" that might not be so accurate. We miss Broadway and Lincoln Center. Do we miss that six story walk up torn down for an empty condo blocking light on 96th street? Do we miss stagnant traffic that moves at one mile per hour in all five boroughs? Do we miss the sight of the skyline without ugly ""cigarette"" towers that rise on 57th Street? Do we miss theater tickets that must be obtained via ""lottery"" or else too expensive for almost anyone? Do we miss the homeless on the subway? Having to wait two or three trains before squeezing into one on the way to work? Do we miss rents so high that we forgo food for just one day for the greedy landlord? Do we miss not having enough excellent schools for our children? Enough hospital beds? Enough health care? Lord and Taylor? B. Altman? A quiet, uncrowded place to sit in the sun? We can be nostalgic, but this is also a time to improve those memories by making new ones better, memories not colored by the legislated greed of only the wealthy."
2020-05-09 13:20:04,"A wonderful piece.
It just goes to show you that it's not the things to do in NYC that make it so special - it's the people.
Nothing is easy in my hometown but that's one of the pieces that makes it what it is.
All the best."
2020-05-09 13:22:12,Sending hugs from Glendale Queens to Michelle Velasquez! I also miss hugs! I miss hugging my students and watching them play outside at recess. I miss hugging my parents when I visit them in Oregon. I miss hugging my friends and all my extended family. Oh how I hope hugs will return.
2020-05-09 13:23:15,"Quite unexpected and surprising, but I miss my daily subway commutes from Queens into Manhattan."
2020-05-09 13:23:18,I miss seeing people’s smiles and sharing a smile with others.
2020-05-09 13:24:43,"I worked in Manhattan for many years and really miss the hustle and bustle and the fast pace. As a visitor once told me, he loved coming to New York to get an ""energy injection"". My wife and I still visit as often as we can, or at least we did until this crisis. She was actually in NYC two weeks before it shut down and got to see two Broadway shows in one day. We really miss being able to do that. We also hope that our favorite restaurants will still be there when we are able to return."
2020-05-09 13:29:34,I miss swimming at equinox on 63rd and quick trips to Bloomingdales afterwards
2020-05-09 13:30:22,"All true. I read this with a lump in my throat and tears in my eyes.

I will always love New York and I'm waiting around to be part of the reawakening. 

I'm never leaving, not now, not ever."
2020-05-09 13:42:10,"I was thinking the other day that our very own Michael Bloomberg spent 400 million (or something enormous) on an election campaign, yet there's not a squawk out of him now - why not help the city in tangible ways? Use some of that money as other readers have suggested to employ restaurants to provide food for those without purchasing power? Bloomberg is just an example - there should be plenty of others, with enormous resources, who could weigh in. Perhaps they are - behind the scenes. I hope they are. By the way, I can't stand the food trucks outside the Met - if you are a vegetarian, you can't get away from the smell of meat. And the oily/greasy mess on the sidewalk ... everyone to their own, I suppose."
2020-05-09 13:43:54,"I'm not in New York anymore. I'm out here in the country and it's nice, but I miss so many things. I miss walking outside on the sidewalk, and seeing people, and going to the Strand and devouring the books. I miss rushing out the door, trying to get to the bus stop in time, meeting my sister's friend there, talking with my friend on the bus. I miss being able to find something interesting everywhere, even if I've walked the street a 1000 times. I miss seeing someone wacky on the street, like a grow-up woman wearing a flamingo costume in July. In other words, I miss NY. Other than that, I miss regular human contact. I miss hugging everyone, and talking, and just being with people. I miss everything I took for granted before the pandemic."
2020-05-09 13:47:12,"I miss the beauty, the intimacy, and the intensity of live jazz at the Village Vanguard! Even in the best of times we need to savor and support experiences like this, and so let us have patience and nurture the things we love...and they will blossom again."
2020-05-09 13:48:50,"I (will) miss taking my 8 year old son on the A-train to Far Rockaway and surf. We would go and have pizza after or tacos on the boardwalk. This was one of my greatest memories from last summer and I was really looking forward to it again. 

I hope it’s not gone."
2020-05-09 13:54:05,How about the crowd and street charmers at The Times Square? The beauty of this Square is the crowd peaks at night and stays there till the next day morning enjoying every moment of activity in and around the Square. I terribly miss  The Times Square crowd.
2020-05-09 13:55:39,"I  really miss all the classic brick oven pizza places like Tuttonos and Patsy being closed. Katzs  and the oyster bar to name a few.
 I don't ride the subway any more and just drive.
On that note, I also miss my just retired R32 class of subway train which were my birth year  subway cars  and unlike the R42's , no farewell trip due to the Corona virus.
Being a school bus  driver I also miss my yeshiva kids from JCSE and Shema."
2020-05-09 12:10:37,"I hate to say this, but I left NYC during this crisis and I don’t miss it. All the things I like about New York City, I can get elsewhere, such as restaurants, movie theaters, nail salons. Outside of New York City, I get more access nature, more space, less expensive real estate, less expensive everything, and fewer people everywhere. I realize that I value things that NYC could not give me. The one thing I miss after leaving NYC is my social network. If I do come back, that would be the only reason. But maybe it’s time to make new friends elsewhere?￼￼￼"
2020-05-09 13:00:29,"Maybe I'm just weird, but I like this slower pace I've been forced into. I like not commuting, I like working at home. I don't miss the annoying loud people. (Maybe I'm a young curmudgeon.) I don't really see myself in this article. That's OK I guess. Just wanted to point out that it's OK if this generalized article doesn't fit everyone."
2020-05-09 13:04:51,"I miss the following:

The Met Museum
The Morgan Library and Museum.
The Frick Collection.

I do not miss:
Cars everywhere.
Noise.
People staring at their phones all day.
People wearing silly Airpods constantly."
2020-05-09 13:21:51,Have faith dear fellow New Yorkers. Our great city will come back.
2020-05-09 13:50:05,"Oh boo hoo. You, me and the rest of the world have been thrown into this. I am tired of hearing about how difficult this time is. Yes, it is. Well are all well aware of this. But, I have my laptop set up so I look out a window while working. I am watching the leaves and buds come out on lilac trees. I am watching all the activity in my yard that normally goes on  when I am not here. Robins, finches, cardinals, mockingbirds, chipmunks. I am loving that. I love that I coached my 89 year old mother how to get into a Zoom  meeting and that she like this. Some people are missing jobs and money, or most importantly loved ones and friends. Please stop wallowing in shallow loss and find a way to be helpful, or spread some kindness. Parents working from home  and schooling or caring for children are heroes too. Let's encourage them. Make a happy video and send it to a nursing home; even if you don't know anyone there. Find a new way."
2020-05-09 14:04:34,"I love my city and I miss Sunday afternoon dates with my husband... heading into a neighborhood in Manhattan and just exploring it.  I miss live music, museums, and the Knickerbocker steak house. I miss the freedom of hopping on a subway and going anywhere I want. I know most of this will be back and that is what keeps me going."
2020-05-09 14:03:56,"I miss the energy that just oozes from the city with so much going on. My partner has been complaining about noise, too many cars and too many people for a while now. And then the lockdown happened and it became clear how much we live in a commercial area, a tourist area, an area of people with second homes who fled. So our streets are more empty. And, yes, we are lucky because congestion makes things worse. Social distancing is easy here. It's a privilege. It's really dark now at night, which is great but took getting used to.  My daily walks are now circles around our block. My companions are delivery people, police officers and homeless people. We say hello and make our eyes squint above our masks to show we are smiling. Every once in a while there's someone walking their dog or going out for a run. Now more restaurants are opening to sell booze, there's a little more energy, esp on sunny days. But that pulsing feeling, that sometimes too much feeling. I miss that."
2020-05-09 11:33:34,"I miss the NYC of the 70s, 80s and 90s, when I lived there . . . Sure, it had some problems, but  a person who wanted could easily afford to live there. You could actually find a decent sized apartment for a rent that didn’t break the bank. There were neighborhoods with great restaurants that were a total bargain. You’d hang out somewhere in the park in the summer and get $1 ice cold beers from some beer guy hauling a cooler. You didn’t need a secret trust account to finance a night on Broadway or go to a great club with a date. There were tourists, but not hordes of them. There was economic inequality, but not like today . . . There was a melting pot of people, including those who had no hidden source of wealth and who had other objectives in life other than the full-time, consuming pursuit of money that is now necessary to live there.

If anything good can come from this pandemic, maybe it will be some kind of wake up call to what the city has become in recent years . . ."
2020-05-09 12:07:07,"I do not in any way miss crowded subways and dirty water hot dogs.  Instead, while I acknowledge the death and suffering in the world, I'm focusing on the unique joys of this moment.  

It's quiet.  The air is clean when I breathe it in.  I haven't been pushed or jostled in two months.  These are sensations that I am soaking in to remember for when the city once again becomes a crowded, stinking, noisy mess."
2020-05-09 14:07:16,"I miss my daily routines that enables me to use nyc as an indoor/outdoor gym
Subway steps, running to catch trains and buses and the last second of a green light, opting to walk to work and/or home, planning my errands with a circular mapping for getting my steps in, etc.
Now, working remotely, having things delivered because I am technically in the high-risk age group makes me feel like I might start feeling my age and I am missing  the real or imagined benefits of my workouts in the biggest gym in the world"
2020-05-09 14:09:38,"We will only lose all of this if we let it be lost and that is regardless of what answers medical science develops.

We have been living with illness and disease as long as there has been human life on this planet and this is just the latest challenge for adaptation. Humans are social creatures and we will sort this out and life will go on and hopefully the desire for a return to normalcy will overcome one the nanny state fearmongering being widely pushed these days.

Just as in previous plagues, the answer is in community and knowledge and love and hope- not fear and shunning and cowering in the darkness. Those who served in the HIV/AIDS crisis and those who survived it can tell you some of what it will take. I entered the healthcare field in that time and remember the fear in both those who were ill and those who were caring for them.

I am not a New Yorker but look forward to the day when I can walk the streets of your city and take in the sights and tastes and smells and views with millions of you. I say the same for Los Angeles and San Francisco here in America and Berlin and Milan and Barcelona in Europe. I say the same for Tokyo and Auckland and Sydney. And I say it for Cairo and Jerusalem and Bangkok.

Better days are ahead."
2020-05-09 14:11:48,"Now is the opportunity to find life and pleasure from one's personal environment; depend on our resilience during change and adaptability. 

Character traits we all have deep within.

The hardest may be to find oneself having to do for themselves from entertainment to cooking, but those are not dramatic and can lead to fun. 

 Because older, I have isolated since mid March (stepped outside 3 times for 30 minutes, appropriately protecting others) and I have definitely learned the old saying that if you are unhappy when alone, you might be keeping poor company."
2020-05-09 11:53:37,"I miss walking to work, I honestly miss getting irritated at the tourists hogging the sidewalks (ok maybe not). I miss my coffee that I would grab on my way to work. I miss dinner out, in one of the two or three places we’ve had for the easy dinner out around the corner. I miss my drinks at The Grill. I miss calling a friend and saying let’s get a drink/coffee anywhere. I miss taking the bus!!!


On Sundays we always picked a place to have lunch in some random part of the city, dumplings in Chinatown, pizza in the east village, something in Williamsburg, and we would walk from the upper east side, 4-5-6 miles to our destination going through different parts of the city, I miss that. 


More than anything I miss the people, my friends, my co workers and the people you see often that make NY, home. Mo, the coffee cart guy. Brian, my bartender, Elba, the hairdresser and friend. I’ve been in contact with all of them, but it’s not the same. The waiters at Amarath, Elios, Nicolas. I miss my gym, and the guys who finally stopped eye rolling every time I horrified them by not knowing some football thing.  


I even miss cranky the people at Zabar’s, fairway, the subway, waiting in line at some restaurant. 


I walked down Park/Madison/Lexington now and it feels soulless, that energy gone. 


I MISS NY!!!"

2020-05-09 14:22:34,"I rode my bike in Central Park yesterday morning for the first time in two months, on a lazy two-lap ride. There was nearly the normal number of bike riders, runners, walkers and dog walkers, and at least a third of them--mostly people under 30--weren't wearing any form of face mask.

What do I miss most about New York? Evidence of reason and accountability."
2020-05-09 14:23:14,"I miss the camaraderie of my morning routine of alternate side parking.  Moving the car to one side while I take a walk and get my morning coffee, the friendly Baristas who came to recognize me, the familiar cars and drivers on the block; waving to the same faces every Monday and Thursday, chatting about whether or not the street cleaner had come yet or why people were parking so early, protecting our spots for those we knew were coming back; the people whose faces I knew without even knowing their names, who had come a part of me in some way, and whom I wonder now if I will ever see again."

I was excited for a new adventure; I thought I needed a ""break"" from NYC.  But I ache for it and after reading this I ache for my city.

It's only been two months.  
The first Covid-19 death in NYC was on March 14th.

New Yorkers who are lucky enough to be alive today need to be less focused on what they ""miss"" and much more concerned about a resurgence.

We cannot put our exhausted traumatized healthcare workers through another surge of this pandemic.

Walking and finding a moment of grace in a neighborhood you've passed through a kazillion times...the thrill of knowing that you live in the most vibrant, artistic, maddening, ugly-beautiful city in the U.S. -a place everyone wants to visit.I miss the fruit stands on my corner and walk home from work, meeting friends for happy h0ur and then dinner, MOMA, the Met, Bemelman's Bar @ The Carlyle after spending a Saturday afternoon seeing an exhibit, browsing Bloomie's. Every restaurant I love and have yet to discover. Cetnral Park without social distancing. Seeing the lower half of people's faces..."

2020-05-09 14:39:22,"About twenty years ago -back in the early 90's - I started learning how to play the bagpipes and would take a long subway ride from my home to lower Manhattan on Tuesday evenings - where I would sit in a small group being led by an instructor --

I can remember thinking to myself - ""Isn't New York  great! - Of all the myriad if different things people might be doing in this city right now - I'm going to a class to learn how to play the bagpipes - and realize a long-held dream""  --

Eventually I ""graduated"" from the beginner's group and joined the Pipe & Drum band - of which I am still a member today --

Imagine on any evening in New York City -- people are taking ballet classes - attending choir practice - meeting with their bridge or book club - taking an evening course in a new language - rehearsing with their community orchestra or theater group - taking a class in yoga or tai chi - playing chamber music with friends in their apartments - meeting for their weekly after-work basketball game - or the poker game -- and yes - learning how to play the bagpipes --

When I would travel down to my lessons and band practices - I would feel like I was a part of that collective - and feel connected - in some way - to all those people --

There's no way you can ""Zoom"" that experience -- and I do miss it - especially on Tuesday evenings..."

This is just the way that  bro’s, that frat boy extension of post college millennial New York, talk to each other.   A small group of them will walk in to quiet bar late afternoon, sit at a table and shout at each other from two feet away.    They also shout at each other just walking down the street together.

2020-05-09 13:45:54,"A conversation with a beloved friend helped me put a name to what I'm feeling for NYC these days. It's grief. When I walk its streets, I have that sense of dread that comes over you when you're looking on a beloved, familiar face of someone lying unconscious in a hospital bed with tubes coming out of them. You know it's them, but you can't believe it's them, and you are terrified they are never going to be that person you knew and loved, who was such a part of you, down to your very bones, and you didn't even know how much so until you saw them lying there.

And it reminded me we have grieved NYC before. After 9/11, we were in this deep, devastated grief, and even then, there was no other place else on earth I wanted to more than my city, my home, mentally shaking my fist at anybody who thought they could finish us off and thinking, ""You think you can destroy us? We'll show you. WE'LL SHOW YOU!""

They named that Arizona city Phoenix, but New York IS the Phoenix. Out of the ashes we rise...singing our defiance of death and destruction at the top of our lungs, shaking our tambourines and ringing our cowbells, for we are the builders and we are the creators."
2020-05-09 13:58:33,"I kind of miss Inwood where I lived for many years back when no friend wanted to come up there - too long a subway ride - too strange.   This reporter mentioned Inwood at least three times.  It's come a long way, hasn't it?  That Tubby Hook tavern used to be the Pipers Kilt with the best burgers on the island.  And then there was Carrot Top, a bakery started by an enterprising woman who shopped at an all night grocery store and walked back with her flour and a gun in her pocket - just in case.   It was the only sign of gentrification in Inwood for a looooong time.   I miss taking my kids to Inwood Hill Park playground.  It was a secret treasure in those days, that park was.   Wonderful memories."

Right in front of it was the saxaphonist who played for tips.  The hot dog vendors would tell me this man was tireless and by late afternoon it could get a little annoying. But in the time it took to eat a hot dog and drink a soda I found it entertaining.  There was an ice cream truck right across the street from the vacant hot dog carts yesterday.  I bought a creamsicle for $4.00.  I sat on the museum steps and ate it.  Gosh it was good.

I know this won’t make sense to many who will logically point out the horrible realities of the city on lock-down, I’m not sure it makes much sense even to me. But still, there’s no place I’d rather be than together-apart with fellow New Yorkers. Love and hope to you all!"
2020-05-09 15:22:13,"For the past six years, blessed with the proceeds from selling a ridiculously-valued California house (we moved to North Carolina), my wife and I have roamed the world by ship, train, bus and car.  New York was on the list.  So was Tierra del Fuego and Istanbul and Barcelona, to name a few.  A circumnavigation of Japan was scheduled for April, our capstone trip before settling in the old folks home.  COVID-19 ended that one.  It won't be replaced.  We're done.

And so we sit and look at out photos, and are overwhelmed with a deep sense of gratitude---gratitude that we were able to see places and peoples that we'll never see again, and which if they reappear will be wholly different.  The riot of experience that was New York is muted and will likely never quite be the same, but we rejoice that we experienced it, not that it's gone.  As an old Buddhist prayer begins, ""All things in transient existence.""  Our lot is to savor all things while we can.  Tomorow will surely be different."
2020-05-09 15:23:08,"I have never lived in NYC but could really appreciate the essence of the place these memories evoked.  These quotes are especially poignant to me:   “It’s a singularly strange feeling to desperately miss the place you are.”

2020-05-09 15:25:30,"There is always an upside to a downside.

With alternate side parking suspension I can drive my car now every day with little traffic to help get free food for seniors in my area. There are few people in the parks making noise, letting dogs loose, smoking pot etc. etc. My big hobby is gardening which has not been affected. 

I have saved a fortune with free senior food and take out food from restaurants and save a fortune with buying wine at wine stores instead of being ripped off by the restaurant. 

As a retired senior with a guaranteed income, I am financially well off. I am in good health.

I used to eat meat, now I don't. I am hyper vigilant about plastic as it destroys the ocean and the fish (you are eating at Nobu). NYC should come back HOWEVER the silver lining of this maybe (and I doubt it) is that maybe it could reinvent itself as hybrid of 70/90s NYC with the massive wealth accrued in the 2010/20s. Less cars, carbon tax, the wealthy giving to the poor and helping with better health choices, Outlaw meat , outlaw plastic , outlaw cars . Not 100% but NYC could transform into a mid century social democracy where everyone enjoys the spoils . Think of the cross mixing of everything - Like Danceteria in the 80s ! The cultural benefits would just explode too."

After New York City nightlife survived the dissolution of Manhattan clubs only to flower again in Brooklyn it's so sad to think maybe this really is THE END. 

I couldn't take that.  There are many reasons I moved to New York in 1999 but one of the big ones was to find my people on the dance floor of our amazing club culture.

I'm typically a very optimistic and positive-energy person. I still am!  However, with regard to the next phase of life in the city and in our country - oooh, no I am extremely pessimistic.

Just look at who we have in government - can you say there's really any hope those people are going to get it right?  Ha.  

We're in for a dark period. 

In the meanwhile, right now - I'm just bracing for what's coming once the evictions are allowed to go forward. I'm so concerned for my neighbors. I'm in East Flatbush and I know this community is going to be hit real hard.

STAY SAFE!"
2020-05-09 15:52:23,"I miss the dogs of NYC. Before coronavirus, I used to ask to pet other people's dogs -- the owners usually happily obliged because the dogs loved getting the attention.  Now I don't want to intrude on the owners' space, and I'm guessing other dogless dog-lovers like me are doing the same thing because I've seen several dogs give me the sad-eyes lately ... almost as if to say ""What happened to all the humans?!""

This time of year, I also miss seeing the ice cream trucks every few blocks.  One of my favorite things is to buy a cone of chocolate/vanilla swirl soft-serve and stroll through Madison Square Park."

2020-05-09 15:58:26,New Yorkers prefer brief encounters with strangers. Very hard to make a friendship in the streets. These comments underline that fact. In a city like Buenos Aires the chances of being invited to dinner or to a party after a casual encounter are very high and usually end up being good. After the pandemic it is going to be worse because not even hugging will be allowed. I miss being pushed around at Fairway in the Upper West Side and my hairdresser.That’s it.

Parents will no longer want their children in big schools where they can mix unwatched, because of the new Covid-19 strange deadly symptoms in just a few kids. Downtowns will die as companies vie to be the last to reopen, and their employees won't want to get into elevators with strangers, and no one will be there to eat at lunch counters and Pain Quotidien and stay in the city for dinner. If I were wealthier, I'd buy real estate in rural North Carolina, because you can telecommute as easily from there as from Park Slope."

The heart of NYC for me was in that dingy auditorium full of unbelievable talent, now silent and empty."

2020-05-09 16:18:24,"I am the typical commuter student. I attend college in Manhattan and as a freshman, my first year of college got cut short. I was commuting to the city six days a week. Every day I was on the subway getting off at 23 street walking into the doors of my college. I miss this routine so badly.

I miss seeing adults on the subway with work attire like suits and ties. I miss hearing women speed walk past me with the clanking of their heels on the city concrete. I miss hearing angry business people yelling about their job while on the phone. I miss the somewhat quiet subway ride at 7:00 AM as were all half asleep, dreading the day ahead of us. I miss the NYC tour bus workers assuming I’m a tourist, when really I’m just a college kid still at awe of my city. I miss being a part of the obnoxious crowd of people that would walk across the street when the crosswalk sign still says not to walk. I miss having a tourist stop me and asking me to take their family photo or which way is 7th Avenue. I miss the times when I would run down the subway steps as I hear the train approaching. I would swipe my metro card and make it inside the train as the doors close behind me. I miss not understanding what ever the heck the subway conductors were saying during announcements. But I do miss hearing, “stand clear of the closing doors please”, followed by the iconic ding as the doors close. 

I’m a tourist from Queens. I never got tired of being in Manhattan everyday. I miss this routine."
2020-05-09 16:19:16,"Granted, I'm not from NY, LA or CHI so can't even begin to relate to the everyday proximity of thousands of people within a quarter-mile radius but in my neck of the woods, I don't miss anything. I've discovered --and re-discovered--and am busy doing so many new and old things I don't even think about what I used to do. I've never been particularly social, though, and always avoid anyplace where large numbers of people gather. Those places always seem like a reason to pay way too much for what you're getting, all for the privilege of listening to other people make a bunch of noise. They're pretty much people paying a premium to be around other people. I really like people--I just like them one or two at a time.

NY will recover, though, evolving into new areas of wonder that it otherwise would not have absent the distancing orders, and you will marvel at them in ways both the same and different as the things you're missing."
2020-05-09 16:22:43,"I’m one of the lucky ones who has a second home that I ran to when the infection was growing exponentially. We stayed away six weeks, after which point I just had to come back. Driving over the Whitestone bridge, I looked over at the skyline — a view I never get tired of — and the spark was gone. You could see it. Or rather not see it. 

That’s what I miss: that intangible energy that is New York. I hope it comes back."
2020-05-09 16:29:35,"I miss brunch.  I miss the subway taking me anywhere and everywhere and not having to drive, not being tied to a timed train schedule for my commute, going out to eat, the hussle, the noise, the get up and go and get after it.

I also miss the quiet moments because now it is too quiet.  Those quiet moments were special, because they were so rare as to be cherished.  I miss the movies, the restaurants, the OPTIONS of anything at anytime to suit whatever fancy you had.

What I don’t miss is the tourists blocking an entire sidewalk and walking too slow.  The high cost of living, the keeping up with the Joneses attitude of most, the insecurities of many that drove the petty competitiveness of most.

Maybe in the other side demand will be lower to live here and supply as a result will have naturally caught up, and rents and house prices will become more affordable.  And we can find a new way forward?  With fewer big box malls invading the city, more shopping a bodegas and small businesses, a congestion tax in Manhattan to keep the traffic levels lower, opening more areas as development drops due to lower demand to public park space, closing more streets to traffic, widening and improving bike lanes, and fair wage laws for those in the lower wage side of the spectrum that we have suddenly realized are the true essential workers of the economy."

2020-05-09 16:52:30,"I miss our (My wife and myself) weekly Friday and Saturday nights out in Manhattan.  We would go to all different crowded bars for cocktails and then a late supper.  I'd say the best was the Top of the Standard Hotel on Washington to listen to the live jazz,  talk to people from all over the world and be served wonderful drinks from a great staff of bartenders, who we knew by their first names.  After,  a late dinner at Frenchette in Tribeca for the best French food and service in Manhattan. We've been almost everywhere over the years and Frenchette is our favorite. I hope we can have another similar evening like that sooner than later."

Mostly? Every couple of weeks I'd get a haircut and a massage. Hadn't realized how big a part of my routine that was. Had a great hairdresser and a great masseuse. Both unemployed right now, and probably will be for months. Don't know how they will get through this.

I miss walking the city from end to end and side to side, even with it's overbuilding of high rises and shadows on Broadway.  I miss Riverside Park.  I miss the Highline.  I miss Brooklyn, and Queens, Harlem and the Bronx.  I don't know when I will be able to get back there safely.  I miss the stores that have vanished before this pandemic.  I miss Chelsea.

2020-05-09 12:58:08,"I’m a supercharged 12-stepper, covering all my cravings for evil behaviors and loving the merriment and relief from them with my beloved fellows. Yes, we have Zoom meetings, now equipped with designated “bomb” attendants to quickly mute the trolls, and it’s wonderful to be able to iron, cook, vacuum while at a meeting, a multitasker’s paradise! So there are advantages. But nothing beats schmoozing and teasing with them before and after meetings, often followed by fellowship afterwards—a group of sober folks going to lunch is a beautiful thing. 

New York City has at least 2,000 meetings a week—in just about every church—and New York is King for great meetings (of course!) Although Zoom meetings!should continue afterwards, I’ll never complain about the bad trains again, really I won’t.

Why? Because I bought a wonderful used Raleigh 10-speed from a lovely gent in Chinatown, and with masks on we sealed the deal with double elbow bumps.

The one thing that hurts is not having my weekly lunch date with my BFF ex-wife, at Le Pain Quotidien on Bryant Park. But it’s not about me anymore, and it never was. That’s the gift of hardship—my instincts for my community take precedence over everything."
2020-05-09 16:57:42,"I miss everything about this city that has gone now. Everything. All that’s left are dog poops on the sidewalk and racist cops and men who catcall you aggressively on the street. I want to see my friends and family (I live alone and have not had contact with anyone other than my cat for two months, it’s thrown my mental health into an abyss), go to museums, go to restaurants, get a frozen yogurt, watch the Mets, walk outside without having a panic attack immediately after coming indoors because what if I got the virus?

All I can do is hope this city returns. I’m not leaving— I’ve lived here my whole life and where would I go?— so I’ll dig in my nails and hang on. I’m young. I’m stubborn. But it feels more and more like I’m hanging on to the edge of a crumbling cliff and am seconds away from plummeting to my death."
2020-05-09 17:16:58,I miss hating NYC
2020-05-09 12:07:38,Quoting a guy named Eddie Antar? I miss Crazy Eddie! His prices were insaaaaaaane!
2020-05-09 14:37:05,"I miss The New York Times, when it didn’t interject opinion into news articles, and it didn’t run so many doom and gloom articles!"
2020-05-09 15:01:08,"You know what I miss ? 
Freedom..."
2020-05-09 14:06:20,The smell of hot pretzel carts.
2020-05-09 14:29:01,"This is well written nostalgia that descends into bathos as mostly well fed complainers describe how the pandemic has achingly changed their lives in New York ---after less than 2 months! e jobs. Not everyone is moaning at the bar because their favorite coffee cart and server is missing. Besides, there are signs of life returning to this city. Last Saturday I talked to couple of young bar tenders who were gamely  offering drinks ""to go."" Their hours and pay have beem drastically reduced but they showed an upbeat ""can do"" attitude totally missing from this maudlin piece."
2020-05-09 15:17:14,I miss laughing!
2020-05-09 17:30:58,"“Just everything,” sighed a police officer sitting behind the wheel of his vehicle in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, last week. “I miss everything.”

This. This made me cry. I miss throngs of lovely, strange, sometimes annoying humanity. I miss seeing the city through the eyes of foreign tourists who stop to gawk at something gorgeous or fascinating that I forgot was gorgeous or fascinating. I miss live music, baseball games or any collective communal experience with strangers. I miss my friends. I miss my busy Cobble Hill coffee shop and it’s hip people watching and the rigorous workout at the gym after. And I really miss my work, which I love. 

And to Lori Smith and all the others who’ve lost loved ones, I’m so very sorry."
2020-05-09 10:37:20,"I miss the bodega flowers at Cozy Corner on 61st and 2nd. I also miss my laundry lady. I hope she and her mother, who run the shop, are ok."
2020-05-09 17:33:46,"I miss browsing at bookstores and the library: the only way to find things that you didn't know you wanted to read. Miss the helpful and friendly staff especially at Spuyten Duyvil branch of the NY Public Library and the New York Society Library. Miss the amazing collection of Victorian and early twentieth century novels at the Society Library. But despite how much I miss these things and people, I am glad that the libraries cared about protecting their employees and patrons."
2020-05-09 17:33:47,"In the summer, in the city . . . there is world class, live music; rock 'n' roll, classical, jazz, blues, chamber, World music, MUSIC from  everywhere and lots of it is free.  I will miss the Charlie Parker Jazz Festival, the New York Philharmonic in the parks, trekking to Prospect Park to Celebrate Brooklyn, Summerstage everywhere, the guy with a sax under a bridge in Central Park, all of it. It's going to be a sad and quiet summer; ""Teardrops on the city, Bad Scooter searching for his groove . . ."""
2020-05-09 17:40:46,"It's been years since I've lived in NY but what I miss the most are all of the people who lost their lives to COVID-19. What I also miss is having a federal government that would have responded to the needs of all 50 of our states. And while it's important to be in place of gratitude for the things we most cherish, it is also important to remember that we have been in lockdown for 8 weeks. And those activities will come back because we say that those things will come back. So let's snap out of the rearview mirror syndrome and start looking forward before we lose all of these things we hold so precious. This pandemic is our wake up call that we're going to miss Democracy when it's gone. Our country is under serious threat; and the call from the murderer is coming from within our own house."
2020-05-09 17:46:56,"I thought I would be A-OK during lockdown as I'm used to a not-so-glorious existence. But I am surprised at how much the lack of activity is grinding at me. St. Louis is no new york, but it has a distinct working class circadian rhythm that is comforting. I feel it coming back, but its still out of tune."
2020-05-09 18:09:00,I didn't know how much I missed until I read your stories.  A great city I took for granted.  Not anymore.
2020-05-09 18:26:08,"I miss the cover of sound.  I used to complain about the noise, but without traffic, construction, music beats, and people talking and children playing outside my window, all I hear are sirens."
2020-05-09 16:33:09,"So, a bunch of people who have no idea how to handle solitude and being comfortable with their own selves."
2020-05-09 16:54:56,"So we miss being SERVED?
People, snap out of it. How serving someone else? Maybe you'll feel better"
2020-05-09 18:29:31,"I have similar feelings to missing daily routines here. My short subway rides, running errands after work and exploring different neighbourhoods in the weekend. And people - man, do I ever miss daily interactions with strangers. The silence on our street is deafening sometimes. I miss the noise."
2020-05-09 18:30:00,"This was a refreshing article and the comments are even better, so I'd like to chime in. I miss taking the ferry from Williamsburg to Fidi, going under 3 bridges to get there. I miss getting off the L train at Bedford Ave and having a cute young comedian hand me a flyer to come to her free show. I miss running and biking around the city. I miss getting off the subway at Bowling Green and seeing what is the latest status of the endless battle between police and the shady vendors trying to sell tourists tickets to the statue of liberty. I miss going on dates to places I've never been before, occasionally with people I've never met before, and that moment of excitement/nervousness right before you first meet. I miss events like open mic nights where you digest an absurd variety of talents and performances in a short period of time, and walk away trying to fathom what the back story of these performers is, and how did it lead to this moment we all just shared together. I miss being able to choose from a seemingly endless number of coffee shops to find my cup. I miss Central Park. I miss speed walking through Union Square subway station, transferring from the L to the 4/5, and feeling like a running back spotting holes to hit, and also hearing the buskers down there. I miss being surrounded by something that feels so large that it is for all intents and purposes infinite relative to the amount of it that any one of us could hope to experience."
2020-05-09 18:30:48,"I pre-miss New York's free outdoor summer concerts that won't happen over the next few months, especially the all-weekend Charlie Parker jazz festival in Harlem and the East Village on the last weekend in August.  A sublime way to mark the end of another summer."
2020-05-09 18:33:50,"Was planning to ride the NYC tour bus with my sister. I hope it will be back sometime not too long in the future. My sister's gone I'm afraid, but it would be nice to honor her memory by doing this with my husband."
2020-05-09 15:22:37,"I miss bar sidewalk signs.

“Madonna just cancelled a reservation for 8. We have room for you.”

“Treat your mother to a beer this Mother’s day. You’re the reason she’s drinking.”

“Thirsty? We can help with that. Loveless? We’re not magicians.”"
2020-05-09 18:40:35,"I’m not sure I miss nyc. I’m right here. In the middle of it as it goes through another iteration of itself. At 7 pm we hear the clapping, horns, pots and pans of the humanity that surrounds us. If I’m too busy missing what was, I’m afraid I won’t feel apart of what is."
2020-05-09 13:23:22,"Today I am moving out of New York City. Not because I don’t love it, and not because it is not a remarkable place to be despite all the challenges, but because the city as it stands is only a hollow shell of its former self. Everything I love to do is cancelled or closed. And I can’t bear to linger in a place that feels like a ghost town.

I will absolutely be back, when joy and life return to the city."
2020-05-09 17:40:17,"I don't miss my commute.  I don't miss the clawing to the top. I don't miss the crowds and pushing.  I don't miss the smelly subway cars and dirty platforms.  I don't miss waiting on line for, everything.  I don't miss nasty waiters and waitresses. I don't miss nearly getting run over by cars, busses, bikes, skateboarders.   I don't miss the hustle and bustle of the rush hour.
OK, maybe I miss them a little. 
Be safe and strong."
2020-05-09 17:49:54,"Maybe, just maybe everyone where we live... we will appreciate those little things we take for granted. It would be a good moment of reflection for those in Georgia to start seeing black people differently... that would be awesome."
2020-05-09 17:53:21,"I don't miss the numerous food trucks pictured here in front of The Met. Noisy, smelly generators and visually unpleasant."
2020-05-09 18:09:12,"Andrew Seng’s photograph of the Tubby Hook Tavern on Broadway caught this native New Yorker from Inwood’s eye for what can be seen on either side of it. Just to the south is the Pizza Haven, which has been in that same location for something like sixty-five years and which still makes a great slice. And just to the north is the old Harlem Savings Bank (the name long ago changed to Apple Bank) where I had my first savings account and which still has that enormous and beautiful lobby. Lovely memories of home; longing memories of the freedoms we once—but will not again—take for granted."
2020-05-09 18:16:37,I can only think of one thing the majority of New Yorkers wouldn't miss............................the president.
2020-05-09 18:30:55,It's too early to become so nostalgic for memories of things past.
2020-05-09 18:46:14,"I miss my husband, who is in assisted living, so very much.  Families and friends, and their loved ones, who can not do more than look through a window or have a few screen chats are suffering loneliness and fear that I’d never even imagined until now."
2020-05-09 18:46:33,"Longtime New Yorker here. 
I miss the wonderful cross section of people on the subway. I miss walking around the city, watching people and dogs. I miss sitting at the diner counter cracking jokes with the other regulars. Hi to Nick at Little Purity Diner! I miss meeting strangers and having such amazing conversations. I miss feeling safe and warmly connected in person to the incredible New York City life I was living. Above all, I miss hugging old and new friends. 
My heart aches every day from longing for those things. It feels as though the ground dropped out from under me."
2020-05-09 18:47:13,"Years ago, my then young son 'interviewed' me for a school project.  His question was ""Why do you like living in New York?""  My answer came easily.  ""Because you can be alone in a crowd.""  
I miss walking miles, absorbed in my own thoughts or a podcast, slipping in and out of touch/energy/conversations, dodging people coming at you from all directions.  I miss looking at store windows, picking up a bristle from a street sweeping machine, turning a corner and finding the side-street shadows five degrees cooler than the avenue.  I miss discovering a new block (and I've lived here since the mid-seventies), talking to a stranger with a Playbill from a show you've also seen on the train home, and scoring a killer pair of shoes at the Goodwill for 19.00.  I miss ramen, falafel, and sitting at the communal table at a Pain Quotidian.  NYC has been my friend and companion for all of my adult life and I am grieving its changes.  I am grateful I had it; I hope much of it comes back ... but my heart is aching."
2020-05-09 18:53:23,Pizza
2020-05-09 18:55:08,OMG I don’t need to be told about the “things I miss!”  Don’t you think I know what they are?  Do you really think I need or WANT to be reminded when I look to The Times for NEWS?  For heaven’s sake!
2020-05-09 18:56:07,"My husband and I move to NYC from the Bay Area on February 14th, so we had a good 3 solid weeks of this city before things started to close and we went into lock down. Having been a frequent visitors of this city, we’re familiar with the magic. That is the city we craved when we decided to up and move from the Bay Area, our home for our for our entire lives, and make the move out here. It’s been rather heartbreaking knowing the potential and not being able to experience any of it. For us we’re yearning for and missing something we’ve never actually had. It’s been a strange experience moving into essentially a shell of the city."
2020-05-09 18:57:36,"Ah yes, but what have we been given?  Time.  The thing we constantly complained wasn't there. Time is the greatest and most irreplaceable gift of all.  Use it for introspection.  The gerbil wheel will start spinning again."
2020-05-09 19:04:54,"I would like to begin by sending heartfelt condolences to Lori Smith and virtual hugs to Michelle Velazquez.

I try to focus on the positive: There are no noisy planes flying overhead; I can drive almost anywhere in 15 minutes. The air we are breathing certainly seems cleaner. And it looks like all we needed to stop mass shootings in America was a global pandemic."
2020-05-09 19:14:50,"I grew up in New York and have lived here for six decades. In the 1960's I wasn't allowed to walk down Columbus Avenue because it was so dangerous. The city has survived many, many difficult times and never loses the indescribable energy that makes it unique. Talk about natural selection--the people who were born and move here will always make it so.  And I salute the front line people who are risking their lives for all of us. You are another testament to our courage.

The energy of this city is never gone; right now it may be held inside, but if you stand still for a moment, on an empty pavement or at your window, you can feel it around you. Give it time."
2020-05-09 19:13:54,"Don't give up the ship.  I remember smelling smoke for weeks after 9/11 thinking things will never be the same.  We don't live here because we like the same, the city and its inhabitants thrive on change whether they realize it or not.   I feel like the city that never sleeps and that I love is in a medically-induced coma.  It's necessary, not guaranteed what will be on the other side when we revive the patient, but have faith.  I miss it, but I'm not going anywhere.  All we have to go on is that everyone who has bet against us eventually loses, just ask King George, Gerald Ford, Tom Brady.  They thought they were right, whether they saw us a rich resource to the crown, a money sucking ghetto, or an obstacle on the way to perfection.  Go ahead, bet against us... I dare you."
2020-05-09 19:19:57,"I miss helping tourists find their way, or showing visiting friends and family my New York. 
But, the thing I miss the most is it is the center where I had monthly dinner with my college pals. Their smiles, jokes, pain, triumphs, lousy bosses, simply all of it that has kept us close for the last 40 years. 
I just want hug them (and my mother)."
2020-05-09 19:21:34,"The public library, and the quirky regulars (like me) I used to exchange greetings with there."
2020-05-09 19:29:12,"We feel for you New Yorkers, former New Yorkers and visitors from overseas. 

We feel for our old friends and our new friends and wonder how and when we will be able to meet again;  I pray for my amazing doctor, for his team and the dangers they so bravely face. Stay strong!

I dream about flying into the city like I did before, to do academic research, to be inspired; to be enlightened by the art on fancy walls and the art on city streets: the heart, the talk and the walk, you know what I mean."
2020-05-09 19:34:54,"I LOVE NY!  We live a few hours from the city, in MA, and I miss no chance to spend time in NYC.  I've travelled the world and have many favorite cities, ones that I feel are indispensable.  NYC is one of those.  When it opens, I'll back..."
2020-05-09 19:40:00,The independent film houses- the luxury of (I’m retired) curling  up at 3 in the afternoon in an almost-empty theater with a rare and unique film you won’t see anywhere else.
2020-05-09 19:42:26,I miss being an introvert surrounded by people and feeling deeply happy...I miss going wherever I wished...
2020-05-09 20:07:02,"I left Stuyvesant Town in the late 70s after growing up in Brooklyn and New Rochelle. NYC felt like home and where I belonged. Left due to a corporate move and now I wish I had never agreed to move. Nowhere else feels like home except Paris.  Family in East Bay so not going back. 
Just want to say my heart is with you New York and I have been grieving with you. Once this passes you will still be living in a City that surpasses words and is as Billy Joel sings - a state we of mind. The greatest and a place that you never really leave completely behind. New York Tough."
2020-05-09 20:19:00,"I first became a New Yorker in 1999 because as an art-loving foodie with strong professional ambitions, nowhere else in the U.S. made sense.  Being temporarily stuck outside of the city, this article made me miss it even more.  Over the years, I've seen so many of my favorite things and places come and go, and I accepted the transient nature of the city long ago.  NYC will always exist in some form, and I will always find new things to love about it.  But I do miss the NYC that is gone.  When I read the article about the closing of Pegu Club, I was devastated.  Sure, other places will replace it, perhaps even by the same people, but the memories I had there can never be replaced.

The greatest thing about the city is its ability to provide adventures no matter who you are.  When things reopen, I look forward to going on new ones; however, I truly hope the establishments of ""old New York"" will never die out.  It's one of America's most historied cities, and the global traditions and cultures that uphold its very core should live on forever.  No other city has the range that NYC does."
2020-05-09 20:21:01,"I had to leave a few years ago after a whole adult life in NYC. Only 3 hours away but I couldn’t get in easily. I missed everything and I miss it still. I still cry thinking about all I miss. My city friends thought I was crazy- miss the dirt? The noise? The rudeness, intensity, the lines, the expense? Yes yes yes yes yes. 

They call me now, crying, missing the city I’ve missed everyday. Finally they understand."
2020-05-09 20:29:08,"I miss seeing smiles. The kind you get when you glance at a stranger on the subway or bus- a silent, shy greeting. The smile from a fellow dog walker. If you look close you can see the smiles in the eyes, a twinkle, a slight lift of a person's cheeks, or when crow's feet crinkle- but it's not the same, because you need to get close for that. I miss the fully Monty smile."
2020-05-09 20:37:04,"I miss hanging out in front of my building and talking to my neighbors.  I miss trying out a restaurant in a different neighborhood.  I miss the sound of children in the morning on their way to school.  I miss going for a walk with my dog and talking to other dog walkers and hanging out at the dog park.
I even miss sitting in my car on alternate side of the street parking day waiting for the street sweeper as I count the different dog breeds that walk by."
2020-05-09 20:46:56,"I don't miss the sidewalk vendors with their carts taking up valuable space, paying no rent, crowding out pedestrians."
2020-05-09 20:53:29,"I live in Milan, Italy; my city's way smaller than yours, but still I do recognize my feelings in this article's words. I do wish from the bottom of my heart that my city and yours will come back exactly as they used to be asap. Love"
2020-05-09 20:57:08,"I miss visiting New York, as I often have, at least once a year for so many years. Here is Seattle, I miss the bustle of Pike Place Market, where I still buy produce and eggs. I miss the swimming pool at my gym, restaurants, movies, plays, taking the bus. People here are good about following the rules about social distancing. So much loss to deal with for so many of us. We will eventually be able to hug each other."
2020-05-09 21:15:57,These deep profound losses of the everyday moments in life is trauma. Simple quiet moments that strung together create life as going on being. This is what trauma looks like -“I never even got a chance to say goodbye”. Losses of an ambiguous nature - will it ever come back? Be kind to yourselves and one another. We are all affected.
2020-05-09 21:21:42,"I miss finishing up work early on a nice day and taking the ferry home or walking over the bridge and just feeling totally free to explore anywhere my heart desires. Window shopping, new streets, hidden food spots, old favorites. Now I just work at my desk from home and think wistfully of the way things were. But as another commenter said; it’s still NY and we aren’t going anywhere.￼"
2020-05-09 21:24:21,"I miss the everyday trust and fellow-feeling that living in our city requires.  

I miss the dance of the sidewalks and subways and stores.

And a million other things."
2020-05-09 21:26:34,"Some cities just have a vibe. NY is one of them. I visited in 2013 and spent many days just waking the neighbourhoods and watching the world go by. The lockdown in Sydney has been less strict but I don't miss the city. Sydney's vibe comes from the beaches, national parks etc. These times make you realise what you hold dear about where you live. I wish you all health and that you recover soon."
2020-05-09 21:43:15,I miss the constant chatter. People say New Yorkers aren’t friendly. But this is the only city I’ve ever been in the world where strangers burst into conversations like old friends. Then just go back on their way.
2020-05-09 21:45:34,"I miss the gym, restaurants, and being able to touch surfaces in public places without feeling like the world is coated with disease and death.  Clearly, nothing special in my complaints, but I’m glad there’s a place for me to type this."
2020-05-09 21:55:19,"The city has an illness, and just as I would do with anyone I love, I will stay by its side during these dark times. NYC has given me a great life and it will give me a great life again. And when it does, I shall not waste a minute to get back to the restaurants, my 7-mile walks, the theaters, the museums, the parks, the shops, the concerts, and most of all, the people-watching."
2020-05-09 22:14:22,"Those little coffee carts that served up a delicious brew in blue and white cups (I’m going back 20  years).  The hot dog vendors.  Oh my god, the hot dogs! Strolling casually for miles on a beautiful day.  Meeting up with friends to at the theatre to check out a new movie (or less frequently, a broadway show). Delicious food and marvelous conversation at a local restaurant. The sound of the City.  Thanks for capturing the mood and the reality, Michael Wilson!"
2020-05-09 22:34:16,"A tennis court, the perfect social distancing sport, is all I want.

Earlier in the week, I had several chats about the state of brick and mortar retailing. I miss those small moments when I'm in a book or record store and a conversion starts with another customer. We're social animals and I have no doubt that those moments will happen again."
2020-05-09 22:48:24,"Hugs.
I miss hugs. From and to my children and grandchildren. To and from friends.
That basic human connection ... hugs."
2020-05-09 22:05:33,This writer missed the whole point. What we miss isn’t the blockbusters we aren’t the tourists.
2020-05-09 22:11:59,"I must say, but since the shutdown the city's air has never been cleaner, thanks to having less traffic on the streets. Unfortunately, it had to take a horrible pandemic to accomplish that."
2020-05-09 21:02:42,"Incredible. When people all over the the world are suffering from Coronovirus and everyone is rooting for each other and for New Yorkers, and when we're all praying and working for the day when we can go outside safely and see each other, and when we're all trying to focus on the positive - New Yorkers whine. Oy vey."
2020-05-09 22:58:53,"Fran Lebowitz often says that New Yorkers live in New York because they wouldn't be allowed to live anywhere else. 

She means it as a compliment, and I certainly concur."
2020-05-09 21:29:13,"No need for New Yorkers to miss these things! 

Do what your fine Mayor suggested in his March 2 tweet. ""Get out there"" and ""ignore the virus""."
2020-05-09 20:29:55,I miss on-street parking for 25 cents an hour.
2020-05-09 20:51:01,"Great story.  Just a cranky boomer comment about the headline.  Don't want to hear publicly about aching (or even too much yearning).  Possible exception, quote from teen-age diary, if truly necessary to story."
2020-05-09 19:32:05,"I miss putting on my favorite shades of lipstick. You may say what a shallow desire, but it's not. The world becomes uglier when you don't see beautiful smiles on people's faces."
2020-05-09 21:13:42,"We have always been the setting. 

You've Got Mail, Sex and the City, Gossip Girl, Spider Man, Dr. Strange, Night at The Museum, Seinfeld, Friends, How I Met Your Mother, Breakfast at Tiffany's, Girls, Law and Order, Power, New Jack City, The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel, All About Eve, 25th Hour, Do the Right Thing, Jungle Fever, A Bronx Tale...

The characters in the aforesaid movies and television shows are living our normal, every day lives. Our reality may be surreal to others. That is what makes it awesome. 

I cannot wait until we return, safely, to our places on that  stage. We are merely its players."

2020-05-09 23:23:06,"We moved to NYC a year ago, agreeing that when one of us died, what better place to be widowed in? To be alone in the city wouldn’t mean being isolated.  

Little did we know the pandemic would threaten to test that hypothesis. And how could we have imagined a disaster of this magnitude - one that would transform our magical view of Broadway into a still life of empty streets and sidewalks? 

When I came out to my father 47 years ago by introducing him to my partner (now my spouse) he said “well, you just can’t tell about love”.  Well, we fell in love with a city.  And we still love New York - till death do us part."
2020-05-09 23:50:44,"When this is over we’ll be reading this exact article in reverse.... things we miss about quarantine. Is this mother nature’s way of nudging us to focus on the present ? To practice presence for the peace of mind we’re desperately craving? Being here but living in yesterday and tomorrow is part of the pain. Stay safe New York, we love you !"
2020-05-10 00:10:35,"I moved to NYC 19 years ago.  Why?  Because every time I'd visited here, I loved the energy, the multitude of options...for dining, for entertainment, for shopping, etc.  I loved all the unique neighborhoods...the cool shops in the Lower East Side (sadly, almost all gone now...), the diversity of residents, etc.

Now, I feel like life in NYC has been 'decimated'.  I haven't been to Manhattan in over two months now (I live in Queens...). Haven't been on the subway.  No rubbing shoulders with all kinds of people.  Streets which are usually full of life, feel apocalyptic.  Things I took for granted... working at the public library for a few hours... having my choice of multiple coffeeshops to walk to/relax in, gone.  Making plans with friends for dinner, brunch or a drink.  Gone.  (And btw, the novelty of Zoom parties, etc. has long since passed.)  

All of this is all the more challenging for those of us who live alone.  

My heart aches for all the small businesses, many of which will likely never return, or which will eventually fold after making valiant efforts to reopen and stay afloat financially."
2020-05-10 00:45:28,"New Yorkers would do well to figure out how their city fell so far with the virus, instead of getting misty-eyed about how it used to be.  And I got other news: all cities call to their people the same way."

I do miss New York though. But the New York I miss does for the most part no longer exist: 1) Industrial Plastics on Canal Street 2) The Chelsea Flea Market on the weekends 3) Bagels with Cream Cheese and Salmon from Zabar's; thank Goodness they are still in business 4) Riding my bike through a completely deserted and abandoned Tribeca and the Meat Market before it was discovered 5) The AIDS mid-century-modern basement store near St. Marks 6) Kim's Video St. Marks 7) Walks along the Hudson from Battery Park to SoHo for breakfast and back with views on the Statue of Liberty with the sound of seagulls and the boats in the background. 8) Going to an underground rave in Andy Warhol's factory building 9) Diversity 10) All of You. I just want to say you are all beautiful and I love you all. Keep on dancing sweethearts. Thank you.
2020-05-10 01:12:28,"I grew up in Fort Lee, which was walking distance from NY. The GWB was right out my bedroom window; my dad's restaurant was on Dyckman Street;  my mother worked around the corner from St. Patrick's. I got my teeth straightened on 212th Street and my first pediatrician, Dr. Barber, had her office uptown, near our apartment when we lived in Washington Hgts.  We never called NY""New York,"": it was always just ""the city,"" because to us it was the only city.  I rode the A Train from 175th Street to 200th to get to my dad's restaurant; took the same train down to 59th Street, switched to the D to get to Rockefeller Center and walked two blocks to my mom's office.  I saw ""Gone With the Wind"" at the Rivoli when it was re-issued; saw my first play, ""The Knack""  in the Village.  I ate hot dogs with my dad in the Met, when there was a gorgeous pool you could sit around where the ancient Greek section is now.  I shopped at Bonwit's and Best & Co., and  remember when the traffic on Fifth Avenue went both ways.  I ache for the Yankees and the Stadium. I can't count the number of photos I have taken in Central Park, proud that I have entered the park from all four points of entry.Lots of us, never residents--at least for too long--FEEL the city and miss it desperately.  As my husband said the other day to me ""You've lost the city.  At least for now."" It is a ""state of mind,"" as Billy Joel has told us. We all yearn  to return, even if we live there.  And even if we don't."

Complaining about a lack of big-ticket blockbusters is the last item on my list"

My family drove to Manhattan from New Jersey on a weekend to venture the city with folks trying to clean your windshield for a buck emerging from Lincoln Tunnel. We still visit Manhattan but those days are quite remarkable. It was the true nitty-gritty New York City. Listen to Lou Reed ""Walk on the Wild Side""."

Hearing bits of conversations in a million different languages. Chatting with cabbies. All the views. Fashion and street energies unique to each neighborhood. Shared chuckles on the subway with strangers. The woman who fell asleep on my shoulder and letting her rest. Construction transforming the city fabric, loving and hating it. Being disoriented when the scaffolding that was there for 3 years is gone. The specific acrid scent in the summer of subway and trash and perfume and halal cart. The haunting echoes of a subway musician's tune, waiting for a late night train. Helping moms carry strollers up and down the treacherous steps. Going home to tuck in after a day out in the melange. Being in close proximity with millions of people without fear of the virus. Hanging out with friends. Hosting out of town visitors. Brunch. Lunch. Dinner. Pubs. Eye contact. Hugs. We’ll get through this. <3"

But we have to make every efforts to guard our familiar scenes and activities with human feelings."
2020-05-10 03:43:22,"I do astronomy and astrophotography, so there's no way I could be happy in a city. But I was born in one and grew up in one until I was 17, a city of 12 million (less light pollution in the 1980s). One of my favourite cities in the world is Bangkok where my wife spent a decade of her life (my goal is to die there, eventually). My favourite city in the US is San Francisco. 

My daughter lives in Queens. I like NYC but for me the pull of the Bay Area (or Bangkok) are their general craziness in pretty much every way. It's not just big and bustling (and SF is relatively quiet compared to NYC) but less arrogance, more friendly, more open, and the adventures I've had have just been crazier. I find NYC relatively conservative.  Nothing wrong with that, but not what draws me.

My favourite memory is seeing Dinosaur Jr. at the 
RoseLand in NYC on October 28, 1994 and then finding my way back home after Woodstock 1994 going via NYC to DC - I was 22 then. Both were adventures for me (since I came via Amtrak from DC and one thing led to another, etc)."

2020-05-10 04:29:20,"New York is a huge, important,  fascinating city, a world in itself,a universe. A magnet for the rest of the world. A home for millions of people. A fountain of memories that only such a city can produce. New Yorkers have populated the globe. New Yorkers have, basically unknowingly, seeded the virus to the far flung reaches of the US. New Yorkers are indeed a force to be reckoned with, especially now. New Yorkers need to be aware of their power to enlighten, to enrich, to travel everywhere and to spread Covid 19. Restraint is the word."

2020-05-10 05:24:29,"OK, forgive me, but this might be tough. From my perspective, before the pandemic, New York City was already dying. The pandemic has just accelerated the inevitable. Here's what I've experienced: first of all, I don't know of any New Yorker who actually misses Times Square, this has become a place to avoid. Theater... I love the theater, but it has moved Off-Broadway. New Yorkers aren't going to Broadway the way they used to. They show up at the previews and after that, it's all tourist. The city (Mayor de Blasio, are you listening) has turned it's back on the people that live here. I have lived in Midtown for nearly 35 years. I love being able to walk to everything: work, theater, opera, museums. But it has all changed, like everything... not for the better. Most restaurants stop seating at 10 pm... what happened to the city that never sleeps... it's turned into a city that's in a coma. I walk down Park Avenue everyday to go to work... I can actually see the cobwebs. This city is done for a long time to come. The landlords have ruined this city, not the pandemic. Stroll down 57th Street or Madison Avenue, it's a Ghost Town, minus the tumbleweeds. Empty buildings, shops, all boarded up. It's bleak. I thought I would spend the rest of my life here. I want to leave, but I'm not sure where to just yet. All I know, is that the New York I once loved is gone."
2020-05-10 05:29:22,"What is amazing about New York is that it inundates all of your senses at once.  Sight, sound, smell, touch.  The resilience of the population is amazing.  They will persevere and come through this."
2020-05-10 05:45:45,"Couldn't finish reading this without crying.

On Friday, March 6, a friend and I had Broadway theater tickets for Jagged Little Pill.  Disquieting virus news was beginning to circulate. 

Should we go, or should we not?

We went, in the pouring rain. A lovely Indian dinner, followed by the show, which was terrific. It had an Evan Hansen vibe. Not an empty seat in the house. 

On Saturday, my husband and I met our kids in Atlantic City. We all had dinner together (15 of us), then the kids all went out for dancing and karaoke with friends while we babysat the grandkids. 

On Sunday morning, we stopped for brunch at the Smithville Inn in NJ before heading home to Staten Island. 

Haven't been in the same room with my daughters and grandkids since then. Who knows when it will be possible again?

A week later I read that 2 Broadway ushers had the virus. The same weekend we had that dinner in Atlantic City, a NJ family did likewise. 4 of them died. And we were warned against buffet restaurants such as the brunch we had, because everyone handled the same serving utensils. 

It was a weekend of risky behaviors, but we didn't yet know it. And we were lucky. 
 
I guess there's going to be a new normal. I will miss the old normal."
2020-05-10 06:31:15,"I miss getting together with my friends and relatives, whether at our favorite restaurants or our apartments or shopping or walks.  

I miss all the concerts, shows, and museum visits we had planned this spring - and the spontaneous trips and events we  would normally do.

I miss stopping by my local diner or Starbucks for a lunch or coffee break on my own.

And I miss my church - the Masses, the illuminating homilies, the choirs - and the Eucharist. And I miss my church's charitable and spiritual ministries - and our many events, gatherings, and fellowship.  

But I'm grateful for this lovely spring - for life blooming anew even amidst so much loss and sadness. For being able to hear the birds sing without the competing traffic noise.  

I'm grateful for the technology enabling me to take part in Mass online and stay in touch with friends, family, and church groups.  

I'm grateful for the wonderful long phone conversations I've had these last two months - the kind we used to have before email, texts, and social media.

I'm grateful to the dedicated health care workers and first responders who are working heroically to save lives - and to all the essential workers who are keeping this city alive. 

I'm grateful for the ways this crisis has brought out the best in most New Yorkers. 

I'm grateful for each day that I and those I love are alive and healthy - and for each person who recovers from this virus."
2020-05-10 09:57:35,"I'm from Buffalo, but I've got family in the City so I visit a few times a year.  I'm a photographer and what I miss is the people. I walked the high line and then made my way down to the Lower East Side, my dad grew up on Delancy Street with Zero Mostel and Meyer Lansky. I remember him taking me down there in the early 1970’s, big changes since then.
I miss going to the big camera and talking with the guys working the counters. All of that aside, it's the people that make New York City what it is. There's a real sense of pride in being a New Yorker,"

Friends, family, and an appreciation of how incredible, how much of a miracle the City is keeps me coming back. There's always something to return to, always something to go to the first time. The last trip was last fall with my wife to visit our son living in Brooklyn in his new apartment. I took a walk around simply to get a sense of the neighborhood and to revel in being there. I look forward to being back there, all the other places which I've visited and enjoyed, and all the places that I have yet to encounter. I miss New York like I miss my best friends. We'll get back together when this is over."

I would like to eventually get to a beach  -- and PS the ones on SI and the Rockaways were never super crowded nor Brighton for that matter... but the subways, ferry (at least open air), bus, were always so crowded getting there. 

I miss my pottery but I have my piano which I didn't have time for before.

Mostly, I miss not being able to plan anything and being afraid of travelling in mass/public transi - airplanes, trains.  I guess I miss not having a car!!"
2020-05-10 11:57:56,"I love the city and feel that it makes sense to figure out more effectively how to live with Covid  in the community.  Be clear who is most vulnerable and reinforce to them (me) how best to protect ourselves.  We are at great risk of killing off what makes New York City special, especially the arts and street life.  It seems to be that Asian countries have learned that the use of face masks helps  avoid the spread of respiratory disease  by those infected. We have learned that Covid can be spread by asymptomatic people so wide scale use of face masks in public places would seem to make sense. Now that we have broader testing available, I am not sure why we can't start re-opening more quickly."
2020-05-10 12:20:27,"I sadly had to cancel trips in April and June. I was last in the city in August to meet my sister, who was there for her 50th birthday. I had first taken her to the city when she was 15 and we traveled on the overnight train from Montreal. She fell in love with the city then and we've met up there often over the years. In August we had a wonderful weekend. Brunch for her birthday in the restaurant at the top of the Museum of Arts and Design at Columbus Circle. We arrived just when it opened so we scored a table right at the window, with an incredible view of Central Park. The waitress who had heard me wishing happy  birthday brought a little piece of cake with a candle at the end of our meal, without my even asking. A wonderful surprise in the supposedly unfriendly city. On my final day, I woke up early on a Sunday morning, and from my accommodation just north of Central Park, I walked down Fifth Avenue the full length of the park, enjoying the rare quiet, hearing birds in the park,  watching vendors setting up, enjoying the stunning buildings along Fifth. I felt envious of all the New Yorkers who can do that walk regularly. And I'll be back to enjoy it again as soon as possible. Good luck, New York."

2020-05-10 14:43:43,"Mothers Day! A walk in the Brooklyn Botanical Garden. The cheery blossoms. My toddler leapfrogging across a stone path, his image framed by daffodils. Then to the Brooklyn Museum. Remembering the landmark Van Goth exhibit with hundreds winding along the walkway waiting for entrance. New York is still the greatest city, even with empty streets. And now there's the High Line. Not long ago no mans land, abandoned, forlorn. The world is what we make it. For now, others are making our world. Don't give up. See you at Coney Island."
2020-05-10 15:06:16,"Years ago when I would meet New Yorkers I would think they were loud and brash. But as I started to meet a few I started to really appreciate how straightforward and honest they were. I also loved how they could make me laugh. After 9/11, I went to visit my Sis who lived in New Jersey. We took a train in to New York and for 3 days we walked 6 hours a day looking at all the sights - and this was only Manhattan! I have always wanted to go back. California loves you New York and we’re rooting for you ❤️"
2020-05-10 15:25:31,"I lived in NYC from the age of 21 to 42 when I moved to Wyoming to teach at the University in the high desert prairie. At first I returned often  to NY  and only gave up my tiny rent stabilized apartment in Soho after I'd been gone for 3 years.( I had to,or keep the apt empty and pay New York taxes on a Wyoming income plus rent a place there). I did come back right after 9/11 and saw the devastated people, the candles burning, the great hole where the towers had been.  But I then realized, ""This is the most beautiful and vibrant city in the world ,but it is 100 percent fragile and man made,  like a sculpture that can be smashed with a hammer."" Same with the Covid crisis. Everything that makes the city fantastic-- the hordes of people, the amazing subway, the endless packed restaurants and museums and theaters, the conversations with strangers , it's very greatness, made it a target for the easily spread disease.  So very sad."
2020-05-10 02:24:53,"I miss the shoulder to shoulder bustle in Midtown where one will walk by and say hello to both Robert de Niro and the hustler I always stop to share an insight with outside of my doctor’s office at Madison and 52nd; where a man covered in tattoos and leather pants walks a perfectly coifed miniature poodle; where a taxi driver from Bangladesh and off-duty stopped to pick me up in a rain storm, and another offered to say a prayer when I lost a contract and could not stop crying in the back seat of his cab.

And, most of all, I miss the generosity shown to a stranger, the extraordinary intimacy that exists among the NYC crowds; the sheer magic of going to an event called The Moth and ending up at a cocktail party at Nan and Gay Tales’s house, chatting the night away with the editor of the New Yorker and a drunken writer who needed a book deal.

I love the fact that the best and the worst exist in a city breathing through bodies from around the world; breathing the same air, speaking dozens of off-key languages but loving the chaos, loving the dream, loving each other.  How I miss her."

I miss seeing all KINDS of people on the subway or passing me on the streets. Miss five restaurants on every block. Miss the museums and galleries I felt guilty about not going to; miss Manhattan’s pigeons (different from Brooklyn’s). Miss the reassurance that my doctors and dentist were available, should I need them. I miss the vast possibilities of my beloved country: New York City."

And no one needs weeks to get ready for virtual teaching.
Kids & teachers are all learning on the fly.
Hire good teachers & supervisors, pay them well, get out of their way, cut all the red tape, get ipads in everyone’s hands, get good connections up & running,  let kids learn in these difficult times.
Easy? No, especially not in big complicated cities but with proper leadership, completely doable. 
Other countries do this. Our little VT school does this. 
My kid is not only learning, but being social, having fun.
Demand more in your school districts, these are surmountable problems."
2020-05-09 16:34:56,"The article mentioned the public schools not being required to provide live instruction.  The reason is simple:  because there is no way to guarantee that all students at home have access to the live instruction at the time of instruction.  Therefore, the entire system is running an asynchronous learning platform, and teachers are providing instruction via recorded videos.  This is also effective and the tools that are needed are not as dependent upon the fastest internet and the newest device.  Just because the instruction is not love, does not mean it A) is not instruction, or B) less than live.  Very creative solutions are coming forth to handle the challenges that are arising and changing on a daily basis.  And so many technology companies are constantly introducing new features, free of charge for teachers/districts.  I think the NYT should find the success stories out there."
2020-05-09 16:44:14,"This one to one public v. private comparison is not fair.

I am a public K-5 teacher in North Carolina. We were on top of it to transition to virtual teaching. Our last day of in person teaching was Friday 3/20. We began teaching online engaging with our students on Wed. 3/25. and yet we are title I school meaning we have a high incidence of financially unstable families. Nonetheless,  similar to our in person teaching, one of our greatest challenges during virtual teaching is PARENTAL PARTICIPATION in their children's education.There are many reasons why our students are not supported in the same way as they're better off private school peers (Low paying jobs, food insecurity, stress and dysfunction, etc.) . But most of it comes on the vehicle of poverty.

In addition, I live in the state of NC where our government uses taxes to support vouchers to private schools as well as having a thriving separate charter school system (neither of which have to provide free and reduced lunch, services for EC, transportation, or the same teaching standards) Thus, incentivizing families who are much more engaged in their child's learning to withdraw from the traditional public school system. I have already heard from engaged parents who remain in the public school system that they are thinking of homeschooling or sending their children to charter/private because the gap, they fear, will be too large between their children and the children who dropped out during this pandemic."

And, that experience is not coming at the expense of exploiting non-Union teachers. Her teachers are largely very experienced and graduates of top colleges (and top prep schools).  They are well compensated, not to mention respected and loved by parents and children alike.  This is not a dig at Union teachers. I can only imagine what they could do with the funding and support (and respect) that teachers at our school get."
2020-05-09 17:04:13,"We have three children at three schools. The most successful schedule has been for my oldest child. One hour of online meeting a day, mostly to chat about mental health. Lots of challenging work to complete. Works very well for his highly gifted cohort. My first grader has a similar meeting to discuss boo boos and then 57 different apps. I can’t manage that schedule so he does a pretty challenging paper packet that I make for him instead. His teacher is fine with it. My middle daughter is tied to her iPad for 3-4 hours a day for pointless, slow, boring meetings. If they posted the work In Advance she would complete it on Monday. 

All of our friends in private school use the tied down method and nobody likes it.  We’ve taken many quality online classes through John Hopkins CTY and we know what quality online teaching can look like. We are all learning right now and I appreciate the hard work teachers are doing. My kids are probably not the right sample."
2020-05-09 17:05:33,"Technology is great, but schools are going way overboard in trying to make everything happen through a screen. The article talks about kids who want to learn but can’t because of technical issues, and it’s just assumed that those kids will have to fall behind because the computer is the end all be all learning tool.

Whatever happened to textbooks for example? They’re cheap compared to these all digital systems, much easier to use, and instead of having to use a dozen different apps and websites, a textbook is a one stop shop for the entire curriculum of a course, study materials, practice questions, and all."
2020-05-09 16:58:45,"The model is all wrong. Let all children take an unlimited number of books out from the school library. They can be replaced when this is over very cheaply, used. Wouldn't cost much. Some might even come back. Switch to foreign language instruction using programs that are available on any smart phone for cheap. Kids are sponges for foreign languages. Worry about math and social studies after they are all trilingual. Read, read, read, and study languages. That's all you need to know."
2020-05-09 16:23:47,"An elementary class I am familiar with had one single teacher FaceTime from March 16th through April 20th. After the issue was raised, the FaceTimes  have since increased to two twenty minute sessions a week.  Meanwhile the students (aged well under ten) are expected to turn in about 20 assignments per week, with absolutely no substantive feedback provided. Teachers need more support and kids deserve more equality. Where is the US DOE?"
2020-05-09 16:57:00,"And one more thing to add to my previous comment - though NC remains towards the bottom of teacher pay, our public school system has put a lot of money into technology. All K-2 students have iPads. From 3rd grade on up all students have laptops. NC Governor Cooper has made it so buses equipped with hotspot transmitters are parked in remote places so that students have access to Wi-Fi. On the public school end, we do what we can… But the crippling plague of poverty that disenfranchises people and (for a plethora of reasons) helps to erode family participation in student learning has got to be addressed. More and more, children with concerned parents who have the means to do so are leaving for homeschooling, private, and charter schools which are funded by our GOP legislature. among other things, these schools are not required to provide transportation nor free/reduced lunch. And thus, the divide grows bigger and bigger."
2020-05-09 16:58:21,"We applaud the wonderful work being done by the privates but here in New York City great efforts are being made as well.  At ACTvF, a DOE public high school in Queens, all of our 544 students either have home computers or have been loaned laptops by us (we've loaned over 100 from our stock) and we've even found, through the generosity of one of our private partners, portable hotspots with built-in data plans for about 20 of our students with no internet at home.  Further, though we continue to understand the complexities of remote teaching though the Herculean efforts by our talented and dedicated staff, combined with robust student and parental feedback, we have been teaching live classes and been communicating personally with every one of our students from March 16, the day of school closure, on.  It certainly hasn't been easy, but no one, at least in our faculty, expected anything else, when they signed on to be an educator. 
We hope to learn lessons from this experience that will enhance our teaching when school resumes on our site, but can't wait to see our kids again."
2020-05-09 17:08:55,"I am super frustrated as a NYC parent that one of my children (in one school) is getting what appears to be pretty solid live instruction while the other (in another school) basically has no contact with her teachers. There is no consistency within and between schools. From what I can tell, parents (at least in MS and HS) are begging for live instruction. How can this be addressed? I realize these are crazy times, but this disparity is striking."
2020-05-09 17:09:29,"How silly even to suggest  that the coronavirus would or could make schools—or  students—more equal. Socio-economic status counts much more for student performance and success than does race.

It must also be recognized that one of the major negative factors many of the cultures of those who live in poverty is that these parents are not involved in, and motivate success in, their children’s schooling. If these factors are lacking students are unlikely to do well in school whatever their economic circumstances."
2020-05-09 17:17:55,"Education is not fair, equal or balanced. 

Not in the US, not in the same state, not in the same district and not even in the same schools. Every child can learn but not every child learns the same or with the same background or earnestness.

I have the best job there is. I am a teacher. I learn something new everyday, right now I am learning several new things everyday.  
I and my students are seeing into each other’s lives like never before. Mom’s in their bras. Kids getting smacked on camera. And children that are genuinely happy to be taking part and share what is going on. I dare say that all students are learning right now at the same unfair, unequal and unbalanced way they were before."
2020-05-09 17:39:35,"Teaching live online isn’t a barometer for measuring good teaching or learning. I’m fact, for small children and early elementary, effective teaching might mean just a quick check in with your class and other students online but lessons delivered via video and assignments that should be done offline. Video should be used for connection, not necessarily traditional teaching.

My second grader gets an hour long live instruction per day. She hates it. What she loves is the 10 minutes of small group chat time with her classmates, the science and math projects she does offline, reading, drawing and playing outside. 

My third grader gets no live instruction. Her teacher has 5 minute video lessons that you can do on your own time and live tutoring and small group discussions. 
It’s not about how long you get live instruction, in the traditional sense. It’s how many opportunities your given to learn, connect, engage."
2020-05-09 18:00:02,"The experience of my children has been more similar to that of Jacob Rios - the first two weeks saw the school getting ready and since then there has been about 20 minutes/week with the teacher while parents use worksheets and videos to teach the lessons.  It's not perfect but my kids are young and I'm honestly not very concerned. In fact, I value the freedom they have away from a computer screen (perhaps I should take my own advice...).  The experience of Jacob Rios is certainly not limited to disadvantaged urban districts - plenty of well-off districts offer experiences no different than what he is getting.

However, I love public education and I don't consider it to be a weakness of public schools by not having hour upon hour of online ""education."" My school has focused on having kids do personal development projects, cook, make their bed,  and become better overall community members. Perhaps now is not the best time to learn math, but life is full of lessons to learn at all ages."
2020-05-09 18:16:46,"Don’t make sweeping generalizations from a sample of 2, as it hardly represents all or most public/private schools. This isn’t even generalizable to each of the two schools, as great variation can occur between different classes, teachers, grades, subjects, etc.. 

I’m an educator and mother of a senior who goes to a top private HS in Chicago, His experiences have varied greatly across his 7 classes.  His level of learning has not been dictated by whether classes are asynchronous or synchronous, online vs old-school reading/projects, or if the teacher is a digital native or digital novice.  Rather, it appears that good teachers continue to provide good instruction and less-skilled teachers continue to struggle. There are also challenges for teachers caring for small children at home,

This article further assumes that online classes are the most effective teaching method. There is no evidence to suggest that is universally true. Another flawed assumption is that every private school student has access to stable internet service. I can tell you from personal experience, that is simply not true. Many service providers and virtual meeting platforms are operating at or beyond capacity.  This crisis is stress-testing those digital infrastructures in ways that could never have been simulated. 

Yes, there are inequities in education and this crisis is likely to exacerbate those. But, perpetuating flawed assumptions is not helpful in identifying strategies to address the problem."
2020-05-09 18:19:13,"I have 2 children (3rd and 7th grade) in the Cambridge (MA) public schools, a very socio-economically diverse district with half the students on free/reduced lunch program. When schools were closed on March 13, the district did a phenomenal job attending to the immediate and very serious needs of the students for food security, shelter and later provided Chromebooks and wifi to all students.

I have been puzzled, however, at why the district has done almost no live instruction. Beginning only last week (7 weeks into the closure with schools cancelled for the rest of the academic year) my kids are each receiving only about 1.5hrs of live instruction per week. The stated reason has been ""equity"" - since not all students will be able to participate in live instruction, therefore none should receive live instruction. For the older kid the live instruction is by one teacher/subject only. 

I posit that the current situation is less equitable. It places the burden on parents to oversee that children can access (not simple!) and complete their work. Many parents are not available to do this daily. Even diligent students become disengaged with endless worksheets and little teacher feedback. Many students may be home alone & a chance to participate in a live lesson would provide a sense of community. 
I think a more balanced approach of some live instruction (an hour a day?), some independent school work and plenty of free time would be a much more effective and equitable arrangement."
2020-05-09 18:34:18,"I wish that all children had access to the best schools.  I wish that all states valued their teachers and their public education system.  Until they do, it may provide comfort to parents to know that, when they  spend time supervising learning, when they think about positive parenting, and when they provide growing experiences (play a game, do a craft, read a book together), their children will learn and develop character.  For parents who need more tools in their parenting toolkit, there are wonderful programs through schools and libraries.  We can't access those in person yet, but books and on-line information  can help.  Taking the first step may be the hardest, but each interaction with a child is the opportunity to build what will become a beautiful and functional adult."
2020-05-09 18:41:23,"As a parent of 3 children, one of whom has been doing “virtual learning” for a year, even before this pandemic and 2 who went virtual after the closing of the district, I can tell you the difference is night and day. The virtual school was clunky, hard to navigate and taught almost nothing but unfortunately filled a gap for our daughter who was unable to attend 7th grade in person due to health issues. My 5th and 3rd grade kids have had an amazing experience with minimal “face time” learning. What zoom and team calls they do have are for social reasons...they play games with their classmates, share what they have been doing and just chatting. 

The learning portion is a daily email, with specific directions to websites and links for my children to learn and do work. I adore this method because it allows families to have class when it’s convenient...sometimes it’s 2pm before my own work is done and I can get the kids started. It allows families with multiple children and a single device to work at their own pace, and there is no instruction on Friday but teachers are available for help, personal zoom calls or just to check in on kids who are struggling. While it’s not ideal, I think our district has done an amazing job of meeting the students and families where they are and still allowing for as much learning, at their own pace, as possible."
2020-05-09 18:45:56,"I'm a 7th-grade Social Studies teacher at a Los Angeles public middle school, and my last day with students in the classroom was March 13th.  Since then, I think it's fair to say that my district, under the leadership of Superintendent Austin Beutner, has been scrambling, doing some things superbly well, but not others.

As a teacher, I am required to be available online for 240 minutes per day.  My students are following a ""block"" schedule, attending my class twice a week, at a set time, for 50 minutes.  Instruction is online, but I am not required to be available via video; I may answer questions and assist through a ""chat"" function.

I teach at a Title I school, and all my kids get free breakfast and lunch on campus.  This has been duplicated since the closure at ""Grab and Go"" food distribution centers.

Attendance for instruction has so far been spotty.  Some kids show up every day at the appointed time; some kids show up every day, but late at night, sometimes after midnight.  A lot of kids haven't shown up at all.  The curriculum they are getting is high-quality, but the disconnect of online teaching is serious.  This must not become the new normal once the pandemic is over.

Instead, the issues that cause the wide disparity portrayed in this article must be addressed in a meaningful way.  Just as the Black Death pretty much wiped out Feudalism, the COVID-19 pandemic must wipe out our present massively unequal society."
2020-05-09 19:17:26,"Our household is living at the seam of this public-private disparity. We have one child in a private school, and another child in a public school -- one of the strongest schools, in one of the strongest districts, in one of the strongest education states in the country. And yet, even from this very privileged position, we have witnessed gross inequities in the experience provided to our children. 

There are reasons. Like many have noted, public schools have much greater diversity of students and families whose needs they are responsible to meet; larger class sizes; less consistent and quality access to technology and wifi; less preparedness to pivot to remote learning; more families whose lives are up-ended by illness, job loss, food insecurity, housing instability, and other stresses which interfere with a student's ability to connect, concentrate, and learn. They also had to wait for clear guidance from state and federal Departments of Education about how to proceed, which contributed to weeks of delay.

But these explanations should not justify ongoing, low expectations for any of our students. Every school should establish a full-day of structured synchronous and asynchronous learning, regular times to connect with teachers and socialize with peers, and continue to hold students to high standards. They must couple this with coordinating comprehensive supports for children and families in need, and move forward as if the future of our nation depends on it. It does."
2020-05-09 19:31:40,"In NYC, at our highly regarded public - Quality of remote instruction is completely teacher dependant. Some students have had plenty of teacher involvement and some have had virtually none. The good teachers have really risen to the occasion and beyond and the not so good seem to have gotten even worse. 
No accountability."
2020-05-09 17:16:02,"The main benefit many children who go to private schools have are, I suspect, helpful parents who value education.  In NY, poor families were given tablets and computers and their parents or caretakers are obviously home, but most of them don't bother to log into class, because many of their parents care little about school and education.  NY spends more per pupil than many private schools do and the results are consistently terrible.  The lockdown will exacerbate learning gaps, not because of schools but rather because now many, mostly poor, kids must spend more time with their families who don't care at all about education and will do little to further it."
2020-05-09 17:31:32,"The no-doubt unintended reveal of this article is that the first priority for the teachers unions is always the unionized teachers, not the children they're supposed to be teaching. 

No wonder so many parents make enormous financial sacrifices to send their children anywhere but to the union-dominated public schools."
2020-05-09 17:51:53,"My Pennsylvania school district has banned mandatory video chats (I don't know what PDE's guidance is, but a friend in Chester County is having a lot more video instruction). All instruction is asynchronous. My 2nd grader gets two optional Zoom meetings a week, half an hour each. My 7th grader has optional Zoom office hours. 

I don't think Zoom (or similar) is the be-all and end-all, but the asynchronous element has been a lot more successful for the 7th grader. It's very hard to guide younger elementary students in this format. 

(More worryingly? 2nd grader's interim IEP said, in black and white, ""This IEP may or may not constitute FAPE."" Districts are openly flouting IDEA in their distance learning plans, despite the state saying they can't--and the federal Department of Education has said they won't be enforcing it.)"
2020-05-09 18:11:34,"Why are children sitting through a video about Van Gogh?  It would make more sense to give young children a hands-on assignment such as recreating or creating their own version of The Starry Night with paint, crayons or pencils.  The quarantine presents a good opportunity to test the online education services  to see if any one of them is a better fit for a child over the outdated and tired offerings of the public schools."
2020-05-09 18:16:02,"Retired primary teacher is loving the online instruction as much as her twin 9 year old grandchildren! Three times a week, we connect, read chapter books, learn new words, discuss; one day is our mechanics day where we study Latin and Greek roots, write sentences and paragraphs from the new vocabulary; Friday is the best day of all. We sing, dance, act out lyrics and learn history and science through songs. ""Music is language learning!!"" That's the message of my website which is so close to being repaired after a recent and very troubling experience. I am anxious to start singing again with primary children everywhere!"
2020-05-09 18:26:59,In some places the private church schools have TERRIBLE remote learning while the local public schools are very good.
2020-05-09 18:28:46,"Through my church I've been tutoring/working with a recently arrived refugee family.  Everyone's spoken English is ok, but reading and writing is a work in progress.  Covid has been a disaster for this family's progress.  The cash strapped district has no devices to loan out to the families that need them.  Doing homework on the family's one shared phone?  Doesn't work.  The church had to pitch in for an unlimited data plan because the family doesn't have internet.   Attempts to use paper packets have also been seriously flawed.  The instructions are too complicated for the parents to understand, so they can't help the kids with the homework.  

This one school alone in this very working class city has over 100 students that need ESL instruction and there's one ESL teacher.   Meanwhile I'm two school districts away and my kid's education barely skipped a beat."
2020-05-09 18:46:55,"I am a public school parent in NYC.  My son's class has 2 head teachers - neither has young children.  My son has no live instruction, not in small groups, nothing.  Nevertheless, he has 5-7 assignments (in addition to weekly specialty subject assignments in art, music, technology, Spanish) every single day where he is to watch a video or read an article or story, answer questions and submit some kind of work or answer sheet.  He stares at a screen for hours with no engagement with his teachers or other students.  It is beyond monotonous and uninspiring.  He is in fourth grade.  Of course he cannot do this alone.  I am a single parent, a full-time student and I work; now I am also his homeschool teacher.

I have repeatedly raised the topic of live instruction with our school's administration.  Each time, the administration posits several reasons, which are easy to refute.

I believe the real reason is the power of the teachers' union (likely the same in Los Angeles and Chicago).  Teachers in NYC are well-paid, have excellent benefits and strong worker protections (all as it should be).  But right now, teachers need to get over themselves.  More than 30 million people have lost their jobs - unemployment is approaching 15 percent.  

Parents who work don't have the luxury of dictating to their employers what they will and won't do yet we are doing the very heavy lifting of teaching.

I would be embarrassed to be a New York City public school teacher right now."
2020-05-09 19:51:22,"I have a thought! Why don't teachers teach and parents do their best to assist their children by making sure the work has been completed as per a schedule 
setup by the teacher. If the child needs assistance, parents HELP THEM! If you're lucky enough to gave a mom,dad,grandparents, aunts, uncles, older siblings, cousins or another human that are available, THEY CAN BE ASKED TO HELP TOO. That's exactly what we do in our home. I'm the retired Nanna. But, I help each and everyone of my granddaughters when necessary. We as adults need to step it up. I'd much prefer to be living my golden years in peace and comfort. However, my babies need me in this troubling time. Not only do I get to help them with their education, we are actually learning from one another about life. I tell them what I've learned over my 70+ years and they tell what they've learned. It's amazing what everyone can learn from one another. Let's help our educator's out here. Remember, they have families too. They too most probably are working through the same or similar situations as we are. It most certainly takes a village to raise our children. So let's just do what we can to the best of our abilities! I'm just saying!!"
2020-05-09 18:11:24,"The problems stem from confusing education and childcare. It is not private is better at educating than public, it's just that you pay a hefty sum to ensure the teacher/childcare person is not offering excuses to renege on this duty. It matters little to most of these parents whether their kids are learning about pink unicorns prancing on green snow or how many states matter might exist as. It matters that the kids are out of their sight. If parents really, really cared about the educational status of children, this quarantine offers a peek into a universe online with visual lectures from a wide range of truly passionate educators. It matters little if you have money or not. Free courses are plenty, courses for a very tiny fee are also available as are the designer expensive ones. The latter does not guarantee quality in any measure. The wonderful part is, you as a parent now get to view firsthand the material your kid is exposed to. You refresh your mind and explore things you never knew existed. YOU decided to have children. It is time Americans reconciled to this fact and took responsibility for these offspring themselves. Stop bemoaning the loss of schools or public school teaching. The nasty little truth is we don't really need them today. AND you can wfh while educating your child. Time, is rather accommodating when you accept responsibilities."

2020-05-09 20:14:03,"Why the derogatory spin on the private school system? Calling a private school ""slick"" for promoting its high-quality distance learning seems unnecessary. Using one of the few Jewish schools in the country to personify injustice and  ""luxury"" was also an interesting choice. Educational inequity in this country is a dangerous problem that must be addressed. But the problem isn't that some private schools and parents have the resources to help their kids. The problem is that others can't -- and that's because of underfunded public school systems, and general socioeconomic disparities. I wish this article had provided some constructive information about how readers can advocate for students and schools who are struggling, instead of shaming a school that simply had the resources to adapt for their kids."

2020-05-09 22:01:14,"I’ve seen the authors claims in my own circles, with one other issue: money paid out of pocket.

Where parents can make a claim for refund, the education is better.

My kids go to NYC public school, and the response has been abysmal. But they attend afterschool at those schools, at my personal expense. 

My kid is getting a better math education from his math afterschool class — in which the instructor is not a certified teacher — than from his classroom teacher with decades of experience. Every week an hour of math instruction. Has he had a single hour from the classroom teacher in 7 weeks, in math or any other subject? No.

Guess what - we’ve been paying for the (public?) afterschool classes directly rather than through taxes. 

Parents could sue for breach of contract with these paid classes (including private schools). That’s why they are offering education like their budget depends on it; because it does."
2020-05-09 22:26:43,"This is a simple issue. Union vs. Non Union. I have had my child at both private and public in California - the difference between the two is not the quality of teachers but the ability for Principals to instruct, lead and manage their staff. 

Public school principals can not hire or fire at will. They can not tell their teachers you will adhere to this schedule and work these hours. Essentially, public school principals are facilitators and not managers and that makes all the difference. In San Diego the unions negotiated a 4 hour work day because maybe ""some"" teachers have kids at home. There are no other jobs out there that employees are able to dictate their work hours based on their home life. There are doctors, lawyers, business people all working from home and all managing (sometimes, it doesnt work well and other times it is fine) but they are working and putting in their hours - there are no allowances for sorry my kids are home I cant do my job.  Another reality is that if there are teachers in the public school system who can not figure out Zoom or Google Classroom and utlize them effectively within a 2 day training period, they simply should not be teachers. Our society must demand teachers that are intelligent, adaptable and technically savvy. We can not compete globally otherwise. Allow princials to manage their staff and watch how quickly the public schools can catch up to private."
2020-05-09 22:19:13,"The 2nd school required “Weeks of training” - see this is the problem. Because the teachers couldn’t figure out how to get zoom set up in a few minutes? This IS what is wrong with public vs. private...but i think you went with the divisive “us vs. them” political angle instead of talking about teacher’s unions not being adaptive to change. I’ve heard many versions of the story you wrote from people around the country. When teachers are getting paid no matter what (e.g. public teachers unions), they have shown to be MUCH SLOWER to adapt. Versus private school teachers that need to actually work to get paid. Just something to think about...."
2020-05-09 21:37:35,I have a hard time trying to pin this on Union v non unionized teachers. It is affluence v poverty. My kids attend a pubic school with unionized teachers. They are doing a great job. But we are an affluent district that already had laptops for all 6-12 graders. But no politician is asking affluent people to pay more taxes to help with the discrepancy.
2020-05-09 22:47:39,"I will chime in as a parent in the School District of Philadelphia:

There has been very little active remote instruction for my child in public school. A few teachers have done prepared videos and they have online “office hours” for questions but I don’t believe any new concepts are being taught. Typically, there are a few readings, a few questions, and that is that. Every student who performs the minimum required work is promised a B grade. The math teacher has possibly assigned two dozen individual math problems in two months. It has made me somewhat resentful of some teachers I had previously admired. “Lifetime pension for this?”, says my lizard brain. 

I suppose we should count ourselves lucky however that our school actually began their online learning soon after the lockdown began as district schools were not required to begin until May. This, and the promise of a financially diminished district will weigh heavily next year. 


One of my other children is in a parochial school that has really put a great deal of effort into remote learning. It has nearly been a full time job me to keep my child on task when the video portion of the lessons are over but at least he’s learning things. 

Perversely, the parochial school may not survive the coronavirus: enrollment is always low and many Pre-K and K parents have withdrawn their children. I estimate the school will take in 15% less money than last year."
2020-05-10 00:26:46,"I believe that the issue of online education is too complicated and cannot be easily fit into a private vs. public school paradigm.  My older child attends a small private school, while my younger child attends a public kindergarten at Boston Public Schools, a very large school district that includes some of the poorest neighborhoods in the Boston area.  It took our private school about two days to switch to full online instruction, which now includes lessons from 9 a.m. until 4 p.m. every day and all regular school activities, such as tests, gym, and music lessons.  Our public kindergarten took more time to provide online instructions but has nevertheless done an amazing job, in my opinion.  Our public school has provided us with a free Chromebook, and my kindergartener has been having regular Zoom meetings with her class already one week into the quarantine.  Our public school teachers have also been assembling packages that include books, crayons and various other materials and dropping them off at kids' homes.  Thus, my family has had an overall positive experience with both a private and a public school, which, I believe, is mainly due to the dedication and care of the teachers and administrators at our schools.  Difficulty with online learning, which affects private and public schools equally, is the inability of working parents to supervise online sessions for younger children, which is often required for effective learning."
2020-05-10 01:13:48,"No doubt the Chicago private school with Ms. Warich has many technical advantages over Ms. Morris’ Philadelphia public school classroom. On the other hand, Ms. Morris and a parent of one child know how to deploy what they have, as shown by Ms. Morris using Google Classroom to teach vocabulary quite effectively. It’s clear, then, that even when student and teacher cannot see each other life the teacher such as Ms. Morris can still find many technical assets to help students learn, sometimes even more innovatively than in person."

First, by its own admission, the articles states that many public schools are already conducting live teaching sessions while many private schools are not. Second, the article again confirms my own experiences as a teacher in a struggling NYC public HS, where there’s little or no student turn out when we do conduct a live session.  And if we’re going to do anecdotes, I would add that a few live sessions involved extremely poor student behavior. Third, teachers are not allowed to grade based on participation or attendance, nor are we allowed to mandate attendance, even before remote learning! This was because such expectations was seen as an ”inequity”. Either we aim for high standards or we don’t. You can’t have it both ways.

Fourth, there are very few issues in our school about lack of tech access since many ISPs make access free while the NYC DOE provides devices for free. 

Finally, the article does make a point inadvertently about the unions placing “strict limits on video-teaching requirements”. Our union makes it a little too easy for teachers to rest on the laurels of others. Most of us know that a lot of our colleagues can do better.

Bottom line, if you’re going to focus on equity, believe me it’s more noticeable in in school learning than online learning. Student effort is also the disparity."
2020-05-10 01:26:46,"In the public school setting, if there are no tech savvy adults nearby to help, then forget about typing up assignments online. 

Focus on live lessons, live writing and guidance given during live zoom lessons, giving the writing structure, teaching them vocab using a white board. Just focus on live lessons to compensate.

For assignments, the  school can print out assignments and send the package to the families who do not have a printer, so that assignments can be done on paper and take a picture to submit it or simply hold it up on screen or checked during a live class session.

Lack of computer savvy can simply be turned into something else- good instruction, good materials (which can be printed and sent), more facetime / live lesson."
2020-05-10 02:07:44,"I think the best thing teachers can do at this time for kids is to go over assignments and let them ask questions. And also for parents. Online learning can still be social. Students can communicate, see each other's faces, and get emotional support through virtual learning. But the online meeting for the students is to get help and see each other, and the meeting doesn't have to be in every day. Also, I don't understand why students need to prepare for the meeting. There's no need to attend the meeting if students already know what to do. Give them personal space, and they will still learn well."
2020-05-10 05:38:20,"What the private school in this story can, in fact, be done by every public school. Students can be provided computers. Many are. Families should understand that Internet access is critical to education. Perhaps municipalities should finally begin to regard the Internet as a vital utility and make sure that it is provided universally, just as electricity and water are provided to all households. Teachers can obviously use Zoom quite easily. 

Part of the problem is that public schools do not have any incentive to innovate or to do what works. All too often they whine and complain about funding. But there would be plenty of funds for better education in the classroom if they would cut the number of bureaucrats in district offices. 

Rather than frame this as a question of ""look, the private schools are so lucky,"" it should be framed as ""why aren't the public schools doing it right?"""
2020-05-10 06:45:05,"So we go from teaching in classrooms to teaching online in, what, two to three weeks, and we are surprised there are problems and upset that the outcomes are uneven?  To which I add, the range of experiences here is individualized/anecdotal, with angry readers lashing out because they are having an unhappy experience.   I sympathize, with two kids at home while trying to teach my own classes.  My HS students have responded to using material that allows them to work when they can (e.g. video recorded to play from links out of Google Classroom, detailed, hyperlinked documents that allow students to proceed sequentially, et al).  If anything, what I have learned is to value the classroom the more.  That is my basic conclusion.  But:beating up on unions without knowing what teachers are working with in unevenly resourced districts, as well as dealing with state and local guidelines, is just knee-jerk ignorance, from where I sit.  As an example I teach under  a ""hold harmless"" requirement in California, which has interpretations that districts were still working out via school boards in late April.  In my case, the result is that  little can be required of students (I cannot give a grade lower than that earned in 3rd quarter, any student can try to raise a grade, and I use a credit/no credit for D's and F's. It's a grade-improvement program and voluntary, in effect, for any student happy with their 3rd Quarter grade).  So I go with high-interest content, and relatively slowly."
2020-05-10 07:21:02,"Reasons private schools have more online teaching, from this article.

1. Wealthier homes, internet access, space and devices.
2. Parents available
3. Non union.

There's another reason that's left unmentioned. That's the performative aspect of online classes and it's become a value for your money proposition; 'we are doing something'. The utility of having 6 and 7 year olds watching remotely for many hours a day is debatable. And there's no argument presented in the piece that suggests they wouldn't be better off looking out the window."
2020-05-10 08:01:14,"With a child in a public school, it's agonizing to see private school education run circles around public education.  I say this recognizing that equity issues are real, and painfully acknowledging that I prefer this side of the fence (albeit my child is the one who pays the price), enduring what we are facing together as a community, and believing that there is an inherent and necessary value in public education.  However, it is hard to accept that those with means, in a time of crisis, get to pick up yet one more advantage for their offspring. The ways in which this virus is actually exacerbating inequity on an exponential curve akin to the march of the virus is horrifying."
2020-05-10 10:15:33,"The pandemic is laying bare an engagement gap. The fact that only 11 of the urban first graders logged on shines a light on the work-life imbalance of parents in today’s world, an imbalance that not only involves parents working at multiple low-wage jobs with unpredictable schedules, but also those working 70 hours per week to fulfill their professional work responsibilities. These work commitments are widening the parent Engagement Gap and that, in turn, leads to an engagement gap between students and teachers and parents and teachers that existed before anyone knew what Covid-19 was. Closing that gap will require more than spending money on technology. It will require a reformatting of public schooling. It will require that we abandon the century old factory school model whereby students are batched in age-based cohorts. It will require that we rethink the traditional methods of grading and grouping students. Most importantly, it will require that we examine the role and purpose of education, especially secondary education. Throwing money at the way we structured public schools before the pandemic would be like throwing money at the buggy-whip manufacturers when automobiles became widely available."
2020-05-10 11:00:55,"I have spent countless hours helping my kids with their school work. My husband and I both have college degrees and are working from home. I studied history in graduate school and have read the Constitution and Bill of Rights with my 6th and 8th grade kids for their social studies classes. I don’t understand algebra so we have a tutor who Zooms us weekly. 

I know that my kids are very fortunate to have parents who can guide their public school education. I worry about their classmates who might not be as fortunate."
2020-05-10 11:12:27,"The public/private divide is deeper and is far broader than a digital divide. It’s facilities, more teachers, better support and so much money can buy."
2020-05-10 11:40:49,"Thanks to our limited perspective, we accept social training underlying public education as needed while failing to see the declining age of human exploitation which it supports.

Keeping an eye on children for more than the first few years of  life is essential to their survival, but in turn keeps labor out of the workforce making preschool a welcome and increasingly needed addition in our contemporary societies. 

Gathering and monitoring them in the safe setting of grammar school for the next several years allows parents to hold down jobs necessary to the survival of existing industries.

As they age and enter upper grades of both middle and high school this nascent workforce begins to seek their eventual positions as labor in similar employment as their parents. 

This still held illusion is analogous to using an exercise bike for travel.

Our society like many throughout the world is replacing human labor with robotics and as this trend increases birth control as well as guaranteed annual income will become social norms. 

Future education will of necessity be for personal pleasure and mental enrichment.

Andrew Yang saw it and his reasonable vision is undeniable."
2020-05-10 12:25:31,"Basic components: Broad Band and equipment. That could be everywhere, if we choose to build it. Good teachers who understand technology  and can use it well in their classrooms -- this too could be everywhere, if we choose to teach our teachers. Small classrooms -- could be everywhere, too,  if we choose to have them. Parents faced with home schooling  now understand more clearly than ever the value of good teachers. Teaching is a highly complex job. The future of  our world depends on good teachers who are able to do their jobs. We would do well to pay them better, respect their expertise, and give them the equipment they need. As we learn to live with COVID -19, we would do well to finance all these choices, as our children will be in and out of school for the forseeable future, still needing a good education."
2020-05-10 13:30:40,"Thank you for finally bringing this to everyone’s attention. Except I envy Jacob, because all three of my children (all in a Gifted and Talented program at my local public school) receive exactly 0 hours of online instruction a week. In my conversation with the principal, she stated the concern was that some students may be unable to attend. 
Why was the decision made to penalize the majority of students due to what a minority may not be able to do? Further, in grades 1-5 there are 34 children in the class. Even if half are able to make it, that is significant. Right now, my children are receiving an education solely because I am able to provide some of it for them. My heart goes out to working parents who are simply unable to supervise their children and explain the assignments to them, deal with crashing apps and cumbersome interfaces, fuzzy printouts, etc. 
Daily live instruction should be mandatory in public schools. The teachers receive full salary with benefits during the pandemic, something that many people can only dream about."
2020-05-10 13:36:07,The article shows why every student needs to have a full voucher system with full school choice. Many of the differences between the public and private school example have nothing to do with the cost of the school. A private school knows that they have to strive to do their best or they will lose students. The parents expect a lot and they get it. The public schools aren't requiring as much time on live instruction. They allow teacher's unions to dictate that they don't have tough standards. The public schools have no motivation to do their best or what is best for their students.
2020-05-10 14:00:51,"When I started teaching, computers were merely a device for learning to type, doing some research, and word processing. In ten short years it has evolved into an essential learning tool for every child. And currently, this. Best of luck to all the teachers and learners out there!"
2020-05-10 14:05:22,"Online classes could do away with 90% of teachers, leaving students with only the best 10% of teachers in the world. Students that don't want to learn and disrupt classes to the point that teachers spend too much time doing parents' job of disciplining, can stay home, not try to learn anything. There will always be menial jobs for them. Students and their parents that demand education will be getting it. Better for everybody."
2020-05-10 14:06:57,"The situation is harsher than this article suggests.  Consider my son's experiences teaching high school social studies in a city school in Portland OR.  He is responsible for 168 students. While he spends a lot of time preparing high quality, engaging, multi-media materials and is available to talk to and respond to students all day long, many of his students can or do not participate.  There are students who are working extra hours at their fast food jobs because their parents are out of work.  There are other students whose parents are working and my son't students are caring for their other siblings.  In addition, there are students in multi-family households who have limited computer time and students who have school-supplied computers but their parents aren't able to pay the cable bill.  Some parents haven't been able to pay the phone bill so my son can not even call them.  Some were homeless; more are now. Charter schools are not a solution to these issues.  What is needed is an equitable system for both online and face to face education."
2020-05-10 14:32:24,"I work at a hospital system in NYC with tens of thousands of employees, many of whom are members of strong labor unions.  Our institution quickly implemented many, many changes in how we take care of our patients, including a large telehealth project providing care to tens of thousands of patients, and use of zoom and other tools for large interactive meetings, within days of the beginning of the covid outbreak.  Everyone, in particular our frontline healthcare workers, jumped into the fray.  Our public school, on the other hand, has still not implemented a solid online learning program for our children.  My children interact with each teacher perhaps twice a week, and the rest of each day is spent doing homework, which all children resist.  My children struggle with lack of structure, inability to focus, and very little real teaching."
2020-05-10 15:17:29,"My children's private school uses Chromebooks, Zoom, google documents, and/or google classroom, depending on the grade. The youngest, 5 has the worst situation. The oldest, 13 has the best. The younger the child, the less a 2 inch box with the teacher in it (or even 6 inch square if maximized) can possibly get the job done as well as traditional school. Attendance is about 1/3 of the class showing up for that youngest, preschool class.
This is a tough challenge for schools but this article makes clear that independent, nimble, market based and union free adjusted best and I second that.
Where to go from here? I think incorporating a Chromebook and digital delivery into education starting at 1st grade would be great even when the child brings the Chromebook to school everyday in the backpack and uses it with the teacher standing there. It allows for easy transition to total home instruction on snow days and epidemics and most of all it introduces the children to computer science at the earliest age and to the widest swath of the students. STEM goals are all achieved this way. Do you know any businesses with their computers collecting dust? Why not?"
2020-05-10 11:59:47,The digital divide was first talked about at least twenty years ago.
2020-05-10 13:55:10,"What I want to know is why is it that a teacher, who is being paid a full salary during the school shut down, is providing only one hour of live instruction per day? If the unions don't allow it in this exigent time, then there is a real problem with that. Sounds to me, that whether it's union requirements or her own lack of interest as she heads out to her pensioned retirement, she is not doing her job. And only 11 people attend? Well, you can lead a horse to water........ Sorry, parents set the tone too... It's not all economic instability. It's parental value on education."
2020-05-10 15:32:12,"So should we dumb down private and public charters that are overperforming with respect to child-centric advancement? The disparity in student's progress when they return to school will be a major challenge. Do we hold the ones back that were able and willing to stay engaged with learning just to meet some distorted sense of age/grade level social justice agenda? Social Justice is an oxymoron because as soon as one makes it just for one it is unjust to another. The failure of Public Education to meet the needs for distance learning exposes its inability to adapt to a fast changing world. I suggest Sal Khan's, ""The One World School House, Education Reimagined"" and Clayton Christensen's ""Disrupting Class""."

2020-05-10 16:01:51,"I would love to know what Ms. Musin Berkowitz's ""so many reasons"" were for choosing the private school over the public.  I switched to public schools after working at privates for nearly 20 years, and having attended privates from 2nd grade through grad school.  And now, having finally seen the other side where 90% of students go to school, returning to a private school might only be a desperate, last resort for me. Private school kids can't learn about the real world well if their parents isolate them from it every day, and that results in a massive educational deficiency in students who attend such private schools."
2020-05-10 02:04:55,"I think that the point of the article - at least for me - is that we do not value all of our children. . . And, this is really counter-productive because this weakens the very fiber of America; if for no other (selfish) reason than needing someone to pay taxes so that our Medicare can be funded, we should want all children to have a good educational foundation.  I have 2 grandchildren... they both attend a fine school, but what kind of world will they inherit when so many of their peers have not had this privilege... when so many are burdened by poor literacy and math skills? It doesn't have to be this way as this is a system that adults have designed and adults can change.  It's to all of our benefit to fight for the rights of ALL children to receive an excellent education that identifies and nurtures their much-needed talents, gifts and skills required for a strong nation. America should not fool itself into believing that talented, gifted children only live in certain zip codes or have a specific hue.  We are weakened, broken and unhappy as a nation when we ""defer  the dreams"" of our children; this educational inequity - this neglect - is ungodly and will haunt us now and in the future. Lastly, I encourage all of you who love children and want to see them prosper and ""bloom"" to please volunteer in your local schools.  It will change your life; it will change the life of a child. . . all for the good.."
2020-05-10 10:41:10,"If this pandemic has put our country’s failings under the spotlight, perhaps the most illuminating is the light it has shed on public education. As an educator for 36 years, I have seen the funding for our children decrease year after year. I have witnessed the decline of basic knowledge  which has brought us to this dangerous point in history, where any loud mouth with a sponsor can spew hatred and lies. The scourge of America is racism and greed. We are no longer the shining light of the world. People who care about their children don’t vote for candidates that slash funding for the public good. If you can’t understand now, how chronic underfunding of education has led to a country where super wealthy half wits, anti intellectuals, anti-science, bombastic, greedy few are running this country into oblivion, then I feel sorry for you. A country that elevates money over wisdom gets what it deserves. You have elected a man who placed a billionaire hawker of cleaning products as the secretary of education. A man who values shredded foam pillows and injecting anti bacterial cleaning products to cure a deadly virus. I’m sorry but how are the Unions who fight for smaller class sizes, higher pay for bus aides, ensuring that art, music and Phys. Ed are a right not a luxury, making sure that textbooks are vetted and accurate, fighting for the rights of immigrant children, etc. at fault? Perhaps you should grab a copy of the resolutions the NEA and AFC to see what the Unions really do."
2020-05-10 13:07:15,"This article is spot on. I'm on of the haves. I frankly, have told my school age grand kids that this virus devastation is an opportunity to get a leg up in the Darwinian education milieu. Make lemonade. Each of my grandkids has their own MacBook Pro. Their parents and grandparents make sure that our kids are online for several hours daily with their school teachers. We purchased educational practice materials to supplement the school online work. We check their work daily and provide additional help if needed. 
I feel bad for the huge numbers of kids that are have-nots and are rapidly regressing educationally. I fear this will go on for quite a while despite the foolish open up now protests."

I decided to try a perm for the first time in years, back in Jan. I was really happy with what it did for my not straight, not wavy or curly enough hair, at a bob length. Now for the first time in years, I am pulling my hair back. I got the perm at the perfect time for this, it looks great at that length, as does the grey that I'd already started to let come in."

I've been putting on a bit of make-up, a little jewelry and fixing my root-exposed hair every weekday. I even wear a bit of perfume sometimes. It feels good. It makes me smile to catch a whiff of whatever I'm wearing and I like what I see when I look look in the mirror.

I can wear a bit occasionally for pictures and the like, but I actually feel kind of silly when I look in the mirror with makeup on. I don't look like myself. My skin looks worse after I take the makeup off, since it's been rubbed, stifled and powdered. Wearing makeup doesn't make me feel better emotionally, it makes me feel like my face isn't good enough as it is and nobody deserves to feel that. 

I can't tell you how liberating it is to let my face just be my face! I can scratch my nose or rub my eye (as long as I'm home and know my hands are clean!) without worrying about ""wrecking"" my face."

2020-05-08 17:03:29,"This whole makeup issue will be an interesting side effect of the virus.   Particularly among single women.

It could be that a women feel social pressure to use makeup for work.   If they don't want to use make up, they should not wear it.   Women should have the prerogative of the same grooming habits as males, but that would be a shame.

But in addition, a good percentage of women enjoy makeup and getting attention from men.   And there have been studies that show that straight women prefer the company of other attractive women thinking that they will attract men also.

Women can talk about the male gaze all they want.   But most do not dress like lighthouse keepers.  If there is no harassment, distasteful comments or unwanted attention, there's nothing wrong with an appreciation of a female.  That's what makes the world go round.    

But let me add this disclaimer.    A colleague invited me to an all girls prep school where he was teaching.   No boys.   Hence, the young ladies did not get made up.  Their dress was very casual.    They were very nice, but plain and unadorned.

Without that preoccupation, they seemed to get more work done.   The girls seemed happier, and more well adjusted students.   My nieces eventually matriculated to the school."
2020-05-08 17:03:34,"When I was in my 20's I wouldn't leave the house without makeup; full eyes, blush, lips. Now I'm in my 50's and I only use eye makeup and moisturizer, and my eye makeup is only a little color, light liner and sometimes mascara so I don't look washed out. I'm told all the time I could pass for 35. I was never one for heavy foundation, it always made me feel too made up like a clown, and I stayed out of the sun. Now during the pandemic, I don't even both with the eye makeup when going out. I'm only going to the grocery and I'm not in there very long. When the mandatory mask wearing is over I may start wearing lipstick to celebrate."

2020-05-08 17:15:12,"I wasn't allowed to wear make up (except on stage) until I was 16, couldn't afford it until I was 18, and was over it by the time I turned 19. Aside from costing a bunch, it created a lot of unnecessary plastic waste, was hard to use concurrently with my absolutely necessary suncreen, and it looked really weird to me (I was told I looked great with make up on, but when I looked in the mirror, I just didn't see myself). I haven't worn make up in over 20 years, and I'm none the worse for it. I didn't even wear make up to my wedding! 

I guess because of my inexperience with it, putting on make up seems like an alien ritual to me. I suppose to those who have been wearing it a long time, their bare face to them is as odd as my made up face to me. I certainly wish businesses well; I hope in the down time the make up companies will consider less wasteful ways to package their products."

I moved to the US in January and resurrected the old beauty regime mainly because I'm job hunting and feel the need to look professional and ""socially acceptable"".  I basically dread the whole process - especially the nighttime facial decontamination.  The only silver lining of Covid19 is that I now have almost zero hope of securing an interview (let alone a job!) so it's back to au naturale.  Tradeoffs!"

I have seen grown people in the grocery store in pajamas & slippers. I hope this isnt the way we are going to go. I keep seeing things about people letting their health & beauty routines go. Unfortunately it is too easy to do that then, not pick it up again. I understand using less cosmetics right now but to not pick up trying to look presentable at a later time would be a dishonor to ones self."

2020-05-08 15:03:08,"Thank you Julie for your piece today about the drop in color makeup business.  I think you're right on target.
Not only about color makeup being down due to covid-19, but the fact that it's been trending this way for a few years now as people turn to more functional forms of makeup, like skin care, serums, face masks  (..the other kind!...).

Unfortunately for us. I've been working for color pigment suppliers to the makeup industry for 25 years now. We, i.e., color pigment suppliers, had a weak year in 2019. I've confirmed this through conversations with many friends in the industry over the past six months. Indeed, a look at the 2019 financial reports of the big color makeup houses confirms this too. When the makeup producers sell less color makeup, ..we raw material suppliers sell less color pigment. Covid-19 has exacerbated this trend.

But color trends change, and ""pearly"" color, the type of pigment I've been involved with for all this time, has a track record of trending over the years. Perhaps Ms. Ayala is at the forefront of a changing trend with her desire for bright, red lipstick? Let's hope so. Color is good for mind and soul!"

2020-05-08 19:39:50,"My hair was looking shabby and since there are no salons open I decided to take this matter in my own hands. Not without preparation. DIY hair cutting tutorials are God sent and such life savers. I learned so much. 
Did you know there are special hair thinning shears and also a gadget called razor comb that takes the shapeless bulk off your hair without cutting the length? And also that some Japanese hair cutting scissors can cost as much as thousand bucks??? 
Well I settled for a fifty bucks hair cutting set (complete with combs and a beautiful case) bought on Amazon. Even in these times I discovered that the more expensive shears were all sold out. 
Anyway I cut my hair short in a style which I usually pay my hairdresser sixty bucks for. I can’t ever match the skills of my hairdresser but even if I am saying so myself I did fairly good job of giving myself a short and layered haircut, but it took me almost four hours. I had to be extra careful as it was my own hair I was handling and if things had not turned out right I had no one to blame but myself. The worst part was cleaning all that hair from the bathroom floor."
2020-05-08 20:34:35,"I just spent $50 at Sephora.com to replenish a few key makeup items and skin care items. I put on my makeup every morning for the routine, and to look decent in Zoom meetings.

For the past couple of years I have wanted to know what my hair would look like, but growing out the color (dark brown) and having the increasing white band on a head of short very curly hair was not a great look for the office. Now, 2 months into lockdown, I am embracing my gray and two-toned head. I have no idea when, here in NYC, salons will open or when I will feel comfortable going back to one, so this may be it for color for me. I do desperately need a hair cut and will not do my own. I look like an unkempt poodle, but that is what hats and hair bands are for."
2020-05-08 23:16:45,"This was a light hearted morning read that inspired me to put on nice clothes, make up and touch up my hair with a curling iron.

2020-05-08 23:24:04,"After 20+ years of coloring, I grew out my gray hair 9 years ago while working at home on a long contract job. Best ""beauty"" decision I ever made. Come on in, ladies, the water is fine."
2020-05-08 23:39:27,"Years before the pandemic, I'd decided to really try to pare down a lot of unnecessary stuff in my life, and that included a mess o' makeup every day (although I never wore THAT much to begin with). So I just take good care of my skin, and put on a little powder and a tiny bit of eyeshadow or mascara (or both, if I'm going somewhere nice--like Lincoln Center, which I miss like crazy--and feel like going all-out!). Oh--and maybe some Burt's Bees lip gloss.
I've cut my hair myself for many years; it's a pixie cut that I could cut in my sleep and it looks pretty good. As for coloring it, that went by the board years ago, and I don't regret that a bit. I've never had a manicure, and I had one pedicure when I was a travel-writer on a press trip and it was something the resort wanted us to try.
I'm not even sure what the purpose of primer is.
I HAVE always felt it seemed ridiculous that women are pretty much expected to wear makeup, and lots of it, whereas men look just fine without it, as we could.
On the other hand, even though I'm stuck home and wear the mask and often sunglasses when I take my dog out or something, I miss having reasons to wear a bit. So I usually at least do the powder and a little eyeshadow (lip gloss doesn't do so well with a mask on) every day, even if I plan to go no further than the end of the block and back.
If there are any silver linings (and I do see some) to Covid-19, one may be realizing what we really need, and what we just thought we needed."

2020-05-09 01:20:45,"Having been a teenager in the late ‘60s-early ‘70s, I never understood the point of makeup. Even on my wedding day, I only wore lipstick (gasp!), and my hair was very curly, so there was no special hair stylist. Fast forward many years, and I still only wear lipstick. My mother always looked beautiful as she was going grey, and I vowed to never color my hair (and I haven’t). One thing that I  have ‘enjoyed’ is seeing news anchors and reporters broadcasting from home. Very few women are wearing as much makeup as they do when in the studio, and they all look better for it. I wish that this trend could continue!"
2020-05-09 01:07:58,"I for one really dislike the natural look. I miss my blow outs for my crazy curls. I could put on makeup but feel ridiculous if I am only in the house cleaning and doing yoga. I have taken to coloring my hair from a box, and really wish someone else did it for me. But when the world reopens, i plan to get my brows done, highlight my hair like heck, wear lots of mascara even though I never used to, and get my hair blown.  I am sick of looking lame and I don’t care if others judge me for it."

2020-05-07 16:18:23,"I think theaters and cinemas are in for a rough time that loosening coronavirus restrictions will hardly reduce.

The problem is that coronavirus can be aerosolized and spread by coughing, sneezing and even breathing.

When hundreds (or even dozens) of people occupy an enclosed space and thus share the same air supply, the likelihood of spreading coronavirus (and other such diseases) is very high.

The idea of taking staff and audience temperatures is only helpful for identifying those with elevated temperatures; unfortunately, the large majority of carriers seem to be asymptomatic.

Coronavirus’ direct and indirect impacts on theater, cinema and other large indoor gatherings of people will be felt not just for months but perhaps years, or at least until a vaccine is developed and made widely available."
2020-05-07 16:40:13,Selfishly I am enormously grateful I was able to see The Lehman a trilogy before Broadway shut down.

Theater has been a part of the fabric of my family for decades. It's sorely missed now. Surely, as the kids say, a first world problem, but it's OK to miss something one holds dear, even while we mourn the loss of so many other things and people we love.

Come next Thursday, I'll get a little pang once again as I see the reminder for ""Mrs. Doubtfire - 7 PM"" pop up. Here's to seeing the full cast and crew live onstage, all of us healthy and safe, in the near future."

I'm sad for this heartbroken cast and crew and know that they have to tell themselves that ""the show will go on"". However, the stark reality is that ""Mrs. Doubtfire"" will probably never see the light of day on Bway. It's going to be ages before the theater figures out how and when to return safely. In the far-off future, this productions' life will be in regional prodns. and school and community theater prodns."

No theatre performance is worth gambling with someone’s life, especially when there are so many safer options available on a screen in your home."
2020-05-07 20:00:41,"Theater was an enormously popular pastime in 17th century London but the Puritans considered it indecent and shut it down between 1642 and 1660. It came roaring back to life with the Restoration and Charles II who had a taste for it, among many other things.
This closure occurred even after various shutdowns due to the black plague in prior centuries. It always returns. We are drawn to great stories and riveting story tellers. While humanity goes on the curtain will go up."
2020-05-07 20:09:50,"It may take some serious time, but it's hard to imagine that Broadway and the performing arts would 'go away' and not return. There will be solutions ahead in the form of an eventual vaccine, and treatments for those who become ill. Certainly masks (at minimum) will become the norm for mass gatherings. Perhaps we'll even get into more elaborate 'safety jumpsuits' for social gatherings. 

The goal of anyone made unemployed by this tragedy would be simply to do what they to do to survive until we come out the other end of the tunnel. If that means accumulating some debt then so be it. One's health is more valuable than almost anything else."

Community make commercials demanding that the wealthy help the poor. Fir example why can’t 100 restaurants open to make 300 meals for ten dollars which are then donated to the hungry every day. That is 39,090 meals at ten dollars or 300,000 a day or about 19 million a month .you mean the wealthy in NY can not afford this . Why not? Get the theater community to energize itself and donate to the starving families in nyc. 100,0090 could be fed everyday at a cost of 30 million a month . In NYC thst is a drop in the bucket. Come on actors get mobilized and work in a social manner to get the impoverished fed.

2020-05-08 01:16:29,"Thank you for the touching story humanizing yet another industry battered - something we all took for granted for so long.

I feel like the Coronavirus pandemic is a deadly message to hit the pause button & reflect. Not everyone will understand - but it’s a time to reassess what & who is important in our lives.

We’re in this mess because of hyper-capitalism and all it entails - globalism enabled the lighting spread of this disease. It’s no accident that it started in the worlds manufacturing heart of consumer products and then went to Milan & NYC.   

I live in NYC and love the theatre - but not all of it.  There’s just too much and many of the recent Broadway offerings are bland recycled films; Pretty Woman, Tootsie, Beetlejuice and the list goes on.  And even if the show is good, inevitably people in the audience are talking & texting, as if they would rather be somewhere else - it happens all the time. And it’s overpriced. Does Harry Potter really need two 3 hour shows ?  No, it doesn’t & yes - I saw it, unfortunately. So interesting the timing of all this - the last show I saw was Westside Story in previews which was an absolute disaster.  Soon after, I began to think it’s just not worth it - the cost vs the performance and an uninterested audience. This was a big change.  Off Broadway is much more interesting.

We’ve reached an inevitable tipping point re; out of control consumerism/commercialism & Broadway is just one small part. It’s not all about money."

To have an entire industry crash overnight has stunned everyone. Will Theatre.return? Sure.  Will Broadway?  Probably. I say mid 2021.  But it will be changed just as the audience will be.  That the Pandemic WILL change their tastes is almost a certain.  The Stock Crash of '29 and the following Depression changed the tone of musicals, killed vaudeville and mortally maimed Burlesque (LaGuardia dealt the death blow).  Will changed audience tastes kill The Mrs. Doubtfires?  Afraid so, if a cash strapped Disney now facing larger concerns hasn't already figured that out and pulls the plug first.  However as many stated in Comments it will surface in community and stock.   My one regret is that I won't get to see the musical comedy genius of Rob McClure at work.  He is part Jack Haley-Ray Bolger-Bert Lahr and then some. One of  the joys of working on ""Chaplin"" (doing marketing) was  the unlimited joy of ""popping in"" The Barrymore and watching McClure convulse audiences. That show was just beginning to recover from mediocre reviews (raves for McClure) when The Big Storm hit taking audiences with it.

However, I  personally lost interest around the time of the Spiderman fiasco. We walked out at intermission and I have never purchased a ticket since. But what I admire most about the theater family is their grit and pure determination. And if there is any group who will find a way to reinvent themselves, it's this remarkable bunch. My instinct says many of the ghost lights will stay lit well into 2021. And not just over Broadway, but over entire city. And perhaps over the World at large? In my opinion, this pause was much needed as everything went berserk. Now we are all forced to do some serious soul searching. Who will we be on the other side? Perhaps The Planet Of The Apes? But I'm personally betting on a remarkable Renaissance. Broadway will naturally be a reflection on this. And you can definitely count of me to start buying tickets again as I truly want to return to my seat."

As a theater composer myself I was tickled to read the bit about the Kirkpatrick's digging into revisions even as the show sits dark. I understand that cockeyed optimism. When you first start out, your creative ideas are sacrosanct; it's almost physically painful to consider giving them up. Eventually, you not only learn to think critically about your own work and enjoy collaboration but you get the (almost opposite) feeling: you feel GOOD when you arrive at solutions. Anyway, I just wanted to commiserate... and send a little more love and support to everyone on Broadway."

2020-05-08 15:58:08,"One of the biggest challenges to good science: the Internet.  I heard once many years ago this example:

A scientist makes a discovery.  The scientist shows it to a colleague, asking, “What did I do wrong here to get this result?”  The colleague looks at it, tests it, and doesn’t find anything wrong; in fact gets the same result.  Then the scientist shows it to other colleagues, asking the same question.  Again, they review it and find no errors.  So, the scientist sends this discovery to others in the field, with the same result.  Finally the scientist submits it to a peer-reviewed journal, where it is carefully scrutinized, and finally published, inviting others to do the same experiment and reproduce the result.  This is how good science happens.

 There is so much pressure to publish, especially at academic institutions.  People publish in pay-to-publish journals, where peer review is not done.  But that is counterproductive.  And now they post online.  Soon they’ll be tweeting.  And in an age where we believe as true everything we see on the internet, it’s not only bad science, it’s potentially dangerous."

Nonetheless, its identification seems important information for vaccine development, for developing antibody therapeutics, and for antibody tests for detecting exposure.

Travel from China was appropriately blocked in January; travel from Europe was not blocked until some time later."

I can watch that Cuomo said he couldn't and wouldn't put in a lockdown like San Francisco did. But then did and it was too late. I can see the numbers that are lower and I can see how the numbers are growing and I can just guess in all my expertise that it is the trucking industry that is now seeding the new clusters. I can guess that it is the tight knit communities that cluster together to pray and co mingle that the virus gets into, and t at you can't get them to comply just because they are the special chosen people? I can just imagine that rest homes would have been hit hard because the workers are low paid and work at two to three places. I can look at a map and see how the infection is growing as it moves West. I can watch in horror as states open up but then the numbers spike. I don't need to BE an expert, but I wonder WHERE THE EXPERTS ARE? Where are the CDC personnel who have quit in disgust because they are muzzled by the administration? I can watch at Atlanta and then I remember that that is where the CDC is.

When the Washington post trumpeted this finding of a new more transmissible virus a few days back, it was all over the Internet. This despite the fact that it was a preliminary paper that had not been peer reviewed at all. Now it turns out that it’s findings appear to be dubious and suspect to many highly reputable scientists who study viruses. Sadly, we have evolved beyond the 24 hour news cycle to something more a kin to a 24 second news cycle, and much damage can be done by the time solid reporting has determine whether or not something is true.   And laboratories like Los Alamos need to hold off on publicizing their conclusions until these things have been peer reviewed, and journalists need to temper their reporting￼.

Yes, the data may not be right, and perhaps more work and analysis is needed. But it is a mistake to reject the findings out of hand; the researchers are clearly not charlatans selling bleach. If their research proves out, it will be of major significance; it would suggest, for example, the need for a variety of vaccines instead of just one.

It isn’t ideal that such research studies appear online, but that’s the nature of today’s information tsunami. No one, not even reliable scientists, can seem to resist rushing to print right now, if only because of the desire to be helpful in uncovering what the virus really is."

Most European drivers are astonished when they drive in the United States - mostly at the lack of discipline but also at the ratty state of repair that many cars reflect.  During a two week vacation in Germany I saw not a single car that wasn't in superb condition - not even a dent.  All tires were perfect.  Lights all worked.  And driver's behavior could be anticipated - in all cases.

If the United States began to properly train and license their drivers I believe our annual automotive death rate would plummet, most likely by fifty percent.  That's fifteen thousand fewer dead Americans every . single . year."

I grew up in GA and my parents and sister are still there. I was already worried enough for them now that GA prematurely relaxed quarantine restrictions. Now I have to worry an unvetted, overexcited teenager is going to drive into them.

As apprentice you are allowed to do those jobs under surveillance of a journeyman.

As a “Meister” I ‘d be slightly insulted now. To become a Meister in a trade in Germany requires many years of training and at least two tough exams. The final certificate (the “Meisterbrief”) is a coveted document, which certifies real mastery & excellence in your trade and is usually displayed with pride in the shop or office.

German driving schools have e.g. been able to apply for an immediate sme business gift (5000-15000 Euro, depending on the number of emloyees), immediate sme business loans at minimum rates and 70% of their employees' wages for three months. Also they could pause payments for taxes, rent and bank loans.

Most schools have already been reopened. Both, instructor and student, need to use desinfectant and wear masks. Only two people are allowed in one car, so there can be no observing students in the same vehicle."
2020-05-07 17:45:11,"The best part about driving in Germany is that the left lane is the ""passing lane,"" not the ""fast"" lane. People almost always stay out of it unless they are passing, and it's the requirement of a driver to move right if there is a car behind that wants to go faster. As I remember, it's a huge ticket to pass on the right.

And if you're passing someone doing 120-130 km/hr, and you see a tiny flash on the horizon behind you, you need to hurry up, complete your pass, and get to the right, because there will be a big ol' Mercedes or BMW hurtling by you in a few seconds. Likewise, if someone is going fast, they will often leave their left blinker on as a reminder to get out of their way.

In the US, we see governors of states abruptly giving in to armed demonstrators who object to continued common sense restrictions on gathering, close contact, and unsanitary behavior, because rules infringe FREEDOM. As much as the Germans are proud of the tradition of following rules, Americans savor the freedom to do incredibly stupid things that endanger themselves and others.  If you doubt me, just watch 15 minutes of 'gun fail' vids on YouTube. Drive the length of Pennsylvania on I-80 and you will usually see at least a few comparable examples of 'driving fail' antics.

Then you have to get your license with the certificate. Then you need to find a water open to you - many stream, rivers, lakes are managed by fishing clubs. This definitely cuts out the riff-raff like here in the US where you can go to a 7-11 and get a license with no experience or knowledge attainment."

They aren't gigantic corporations that can burn through huge piles of cash.  These are mostly small family owned businesses.  

This also goes for professional services.  Why bother unless absolutely necessary?  Why take the chance?  People will postpone unnecessary tasks and purchases until the virus clears out.  Why take the chance to buy a new car now when the old one works just fine?

Republicans say that we will just have to protect the vulnerable and they may be the only ones who will have to practice social distancing. Trump when asked about schools reopening said older teachers (60+) years would have to ""sit out for awhile"".  

Here are some questions that reporters need to ask the administration officials:

There are approximately 34M americans with diabetes, how do you propose to protect them from COVID? About 100M  Americans have hypertension, how do we protect them?As for those 60 year old, will employers keep them? If they sit out, will they get paid or will they be eligible for disability? 

Will employers  be forced to have special accommodation for older workers or workers with Asthma, Diabetes, Cancer, Autoimmune diseases and Hypertension? 

There are 6.2M kids with asthma (or 1 in 12 school age kids), how will schools protect those vulnerable kids from COVID? Will there be special classrooms or other special facilities? Will asthmatic kids have to stay home?  Will FMLA be expanded to accomodate parents now forced to care for their kids who are vulnerable to COVID complications?

And what is to stop employers from only re-hiring 45 and below or  former workers without co-morbid conditions?"

Today the website Marketwatch, which is owned by Rupert Murdoch who also owns FOX News, has as it's headlines ""Historic rate of layoffs may be slowing as 3.2 million Americans file initial unemployment claims."" What is that all about?

Our country is seeing increased deaths and cases in over half of the states, many of which are re-opening, based on representations of the president. Today's claims report is but a half a million less than last week, which was 3.8 million, making the overall number over 33 million unemployed. That would be the worst number of Americans out jobs since the Great Depression. Yet, the stock market goes up. What is going on?

It appears that Wall Street is carrying on with a possible fraud on the grounds that apparently they want to our authoritarian wannabe to continue as President. While Trump is playing his Nero fiddle America is burning badly, and the fire is still glowingly bright.

We are dramatically low in testing, social distancing is being protested, meat packers are continuing to be infected with Covid-19, and VP Pence says this could be all over in a few weeks. Meanwhile, there's more Americans dead today than the bomb killed Japanese in Nagasaki during WW2.

If this is what Americans want to see going forward by closing their eyes as Trump makes excuses for this continued killing, then our America is surely doomed."

All of these services if made a priority would have prepared us and reduced the covid19 pandemic in the US.

Republicans in Congress, including President Trump, have been funding large corporations, but resisting support for state governments which worsens the future for state and local governments, school districts and citizen.

Republican politicians are doing all they can, taking advantage of every crisis to design an apartheid and class economy of the ""owners"" vs the ""workers"" with owners being Wall Street, large investors, corporations, Republican politicians who rule the nation.

911, the 2008 economic collapse and the covid19 pandemic serve their purposes with absolutely no incentive to prepare for and prevent. The greater the damage, the weaker workers are, the more opportunity Republicans have with their owner class to pick up the pieces for themselves for pennies on dollars that we are worth."

The myth of die hard western capitalism is broken rather shattered. How western Europe and America coped with pandemic has exposed their cultural depth. Unlike few Asian countries like Japan, China, South korea, Taiwan, Singapore and  European countries like Norway Denmark and resilient Newzeland and Canada others have faltered big time.

The solutions that are needed are counter intuitive. To start: 
Decreased corporate and business taxes, yet profoundly increased dividend, income, estate and stock buy back taxes; capital needs to be put to work or reallocated, period.
Amended employment laws where 30 hours a week is full time, time and a half beyond that and triple time beyond 44 hours with no exemptions; we need to get people working and incentivize employers to hire.

Fear of immigrants

Restaurants provide examples of both high and unnecessary risk, and optional spending.  These are the last things people will flock to during a pandemic.

When the downside is getting a disease -- or spreading one to their families -- people will choose not to do what they don't have to do.  And they simply do not have to go to restaurants, so they will not in numbers that will make any meaningful economic difference."

America buys online and will continue to do so. Why spend money, which we don't have, on overpriced items that you can get on Amazon, Walmart? Why do think these stores and all of the ""Dollar"" stores are thriving? America is broke and it will only get worse.

It took several years for the economy to bounce back after 2008 debacle. This is as close to a death knell as we've ever experienced in 100 years. My guesstimate is we won't recover from this for at least 5 years or more.

Medical premiums that are through the roof, $5000 per person deductibles, insurmountable student loan debt, stagnant wages that have risen a paltry 3% since 2000, no pensions or job security and so much more.

Couple all of this with a total lack of leadership, vision or any sort of plan p tactical or otherwise, and we are doomed as a country. And if Trump is reelected, we might as well start looking to buy a house in Canada.

The middle-class is long gone and ain't coming back. People are broke and have no savings to pay their rent or mortgages. When citizens need to decide between medicine food or rent, societies start to crumble.

So what are the options if there is no vaccine or ameliorative medicine?  The systems of political economy are already at the breaking point and catastrophe in one form or another appears inevitable.  We need to keep the economy afloat or risk becoming a failed state.

2020-05-07 15:41:50,"It's unfortunate that a still-defective ACA will be causing some problems for the newly unemployed.

One of the problems, ill-publicized, is that in many states, much ACA coverage isn't even insurance.

Specifically, the ACA expanded Medicaid, that covers perhaps half of people on the ACA, is, in at least 10 states (many of them blue like MA, MD, and NJ), for people 55 and over, subject to Medicaid estate recovery.

What this means is that peoples' medical bills are paid out for them now, but will be taken from their estates when they die.  This is really not what many expect--like many of us, they want to leave assets for their children.  So in those states, people 55 and older, who get expanded Medicaid (income to 138% of Fed. Pov. Lvl.) do not have insurance--they have a bomb in the form of only a loan until death for medical expenses.

This defect was publicized a bit in 2013 /2014, such as in The Atlantic, here: 

<a href=""https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2014/01/can-medicaid-really-come-after-you-house-when-you-die/357357"" target=""_blank"">https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2014/01/can-medicaid-really-come-after-you-house-when-you-die/357357</a>/ 

and, in fact certains states, like OR, WA, NY, VT, CA, and MN did fix their recovery laws to make all ACA coverage real insurance since 2013.  But many did not.

The problem could be fixed Federally, or statewise in the 10 states.  It should be done right now.

(For updates since 2104, see the Wikipedia article on Medicaid estate recovery.  Wikipedia is not, in itself, reliable, but sound references at the end of the article can be clicked on.)"

His view was that approximately a third of consumers, mostly young and healthy, would rush back to bars and restaurants without much worry.  Another third would hold back and wait and see what happens before venturing out.  Finally, the last third who are older, have underlying health conditions, or are simply the most risk-adverse, would not go back for a long, long time, perhaps two or three years, until they're convinced it's safe.  I'll be interested in seeing if he turns out to be right, and if his prediction will be valid for other businesses as well."

Millions of unemployed are going to need new jobs in the coming months -- once their benefits and stimulus run dry.  Who's really thinking about this?

The coronavirus is a tragedy, but its consequences are only speeding up certain forces of change that have been around for a couple of decades -- forces that make the possibility of MILLIONS of new jobs largely untenable -- that is, not without massive jobs programs.

Automation and the disruption of jobs go hand-in-hand.  The rapid rise of remote working, for example, only means that more companies are discovering how to become more productive with fewer workers; more adaptive and resilient to volatile market shocks.  This is thanks to the adoption of technologies that are themselves becoming more an everyday part of our lives -- more powerful, cheaper, easier to implement, and more feasible.    This trend is only accelerating.

The Social Contract is being re-written, with the rise of ""gig workers.""  What will ""re-opening"" really mean for millions of people with jobs like these?"
2020-05-07 16:38:29,"Remember polio? NO? Because you are too young to remember the 50's. But in the 50's before the vaccine I school mate of mine who lived three houses from mine came down with the disease. As soon as this virus came out the memories of the time came back to me in vivid color.
The young girl and a neighbor friend was in an iron lung in her family living room. All of us in the neighborhood missed her and we were told by our parents to stay away from the house. We did not!
Her mother bought comic books and we sat on the front porch reading them and looking through the window to see the machine. We heard it working and it was indeed scary. We saw her face through the mirror above her face looking at us and I for one will never forget the look of fear and pain on her face. She knew she was going to die but day after day we spent our summer on her porch watching her and talking to her through the screen door. She didn't talk back but we all tried to be pleasant and even told childhood joked.
Why am I telling this now? Because everyone should understand that this virus is as scary as polio was then. We need to use our minds and keep distance and obey the rules or we may end up in the 2020 version of the iron lung ourselves or might just get the virus and pass it on to our children, parents, or friends. This is a new world and we must remain careful and not listen to anyone that says it is ""no big deal"" because that is what we thought until the iron lung arrived on our street."

The applicants for regular state UI (W-2 recipients) are made to wait months for either a payment or a denial letter.  Benefits are claimed weekly over the course of months while state offices slowly contact recent employers (by mail) to confirm applicants exist, what they earned, if they're separated and why, etc. ... many of these inquiries go to employers who will never reopen their doors or even their mail, or to they use ""representatives,"" who are just glorified payroll companies trained in the art of delaying and denying claimant's applications for benefits.  It takes months after a surge in unemployment filings to allow everyone who wants to file to try to, and/or backdate their claims, and/or start appeals of their denials.  The system is designed this way intentionally to keep employers tax rates low by denying the unemployed benefits with slow and complex systems that are governed by arcane laws.  This is what happened during the dot.com crash and after 9/11 and after the Great Recession ... and now during the Covid-19 pandemic.

One doesn’t need to be callus about others dying to recognize that that economy needs to open now or exponentially more people will suffer and die, and they will do so for generations.

Most of those calculations are out the window for the foreseeable future, because space requirements per seat will have to expand, and fewer customers will be able (or even want) to pass through. All of that translates into lower revenue. As a result, such places will probably need to completely rethink their business models and substantially revise employee requirements. Many (most) may need to renegotiate their space requirements, while looking for ways to lower other fixed costs like heating, cooling, waste services, etc. to have any hope of surviving. These negative effects will, in turn, leech into their supply chains, maintenance services, the real estate market, and practically every other support cost associated with their business.

Most other types of businesses, particularly in the services area, will see varying degrees of the same effects, causing similar ripples.

Let us also remind ourselves that the goal was to gain a few weeks to institute testing and tracing to allow the economy to restart. Many nations such a as Germany did.

Corporate stimulus and tax breaks are largely useless; what's needed is consumer demand that is only possible through wage replacement therapy and public works, infrastructure investment and public health investment that paves the way to a methodical recovery.

Unfortunately, the only serious leaders reside in some state governorships that are taking matters seriously, but with the current tax cut know-nothing leader in the White House and his Republican co-conspirators in the Senate, there is no serious leadership at the federal level.

""Take two tax cuts and a big gulp of the coronavirus and call me from the morgue"" is no way to get out of this mess, but that is currently the official Trump-GOP recovery plan.

Now that the state is opening back up, the YMCA wants her in the pool teaching kids by June 1. No exceptions. But there is no social distancing in the swimming pool. You cannot teach swimming without getting spit on. She either has to choose to quit or put herself at risk. 

Meanwhile, my workplace is keeping us all home until at least the end of the year. The disconnect is so confusing. It feels as if society has decided my life is more valuable than hers. But she's my mom. There's nobody I love more.

Lincoln was assassinated so I'm not sure how he had it better.

People need money.  People need jobs that pay a decent wage.  People need access to medical care instead of access to a wealth care system.  People need food, decent housing, decent educations.  The country is in dire need of an improved/upgraded infrastructure in transportation and communication.  Donald Trump and his cronies have accomplished none of this.  All they have done is drive the economy and Americans into ruin.  

This crisis is not the result of an invading force, a war, or an alien invasion.

Lost in all this is the worker, whether he is in the US or in China, trying to make ends meet.  When one gets laid off in the US, overnight one loses health coverage - if one had (employer based) coverage to start with.  Continuing coverage in Cobra without any income coming in has the last priority.  And Trump's minions are to appear before the Supreme Court to disband the ACA.

More sickening news from Reuters on this front today:

U.S. companies got emergency government loans despite having months of cash

Some recipients, though, had considerable cash on hand. Forty-one publicly traded companies that got the emergency aid already had enough to cover basic expenses for two months or more when they applied for the funds, a Reuters analysis found — even if their revenue dropped to zero. Thirty had three months or more of cash. Six had enough to last at least until December, according to the review, which was based on average monthly operating expenses from 2019.

Out of work people receiving unemployment plus the $600/week kicker are being told they will lose their benefit if they don’t take a job offer – even one that results in significantly lower wages. 
To me, this looks like a violation of the thirteenth amendment. If a proprietor has taken advantage of the PPP or other stimulus programs, the new minimum wage is what the prospective employee is making while unemployed! Forcing someone to take a wage lower than their current income is “involuntary servitude” – no excuses.
If a business cannot survive paying their employees, the current (state and federal) unemployment rate they should not be allowed to reopen. 
The minimum wage in any area must provide the employee enough to have a home, food and normal human needs and comforts. There should be a standardized process for determining living wages to account for regional differences, but the floor is the average for the country as a whole.
This may sound Un-American, but our country is based on ""Liberty and Justice for all"". Restaurants making employees live off of tips are nothing more than the modern version slave owners using a bull whip to get more work out of their slaves.

Each recession has hurt the average working American more than the one before it.  We don't earn real interest on our savings.  We're forced to spend more than we earn if we want to have a semi decent place to live and, at this point having a cellphone and computer is a necessity.  This virus, or to be more precise, the reaction to this virus, has showed us how weak the economy is for working Americans.  

In the last recession people lost everything.  Once you lose everything it's hard to get back on track.  How will Americans survive a depression with politicians in power who refuse to do anything to help us?  The Senate is run by the GOP.  It doesn't matter what the House says.  McConnell doesn't want to do it it won't be done.  

For a country that claims to value life we do a poor job of showing it.  We have an excellent wealth care system.  We have a ton of luxury housing.  We have many excellent public schools but you have to be able to afford the price of housing to get your kids in the door.  The profits are shared liberally among the wealthiest.  All the rest of us want is enough to have decent lives.  Why is that such a problem?  I don't see anyone asking for a hammock to lie in until they can retire (and at this point if someone did I'd give it to them).

With 20% of GDP accruing from tourism in some countries, I can see European tourism and European economies facing an existential threat if tourists disappear.  Even the migrant population that serves tourists will hurt.

As a frequent traveler to Europe, I am staying put.  Europe is indeed exciting, an adventure, but not comfortable.  A lot of improvisation is needed during travel, much of it joyful.  However, falling sick in well-served tourist traps, or in secluded places without local language skills are deal breakers. 

I am not traveling inside the US this summer either.  The visit to the fabulous museums, and the majestic state parks can wait.  I can drive, but I fear having to use public facilities and live in air conditioned lodgings.

If I were French I would not want the usual hordes descending right after the peak of a pandemic, not matter what incentives my government or tourist businesses might be offering.

This means that all the interior glass surfaces of the mini-greenhouses must be sanitized when diners have left after each meal.

It was closer to 10% when we adjust for people that had stopped looking for work after the 2008 recession but were still counted as employed, could only find part time work (a part time worker at Walmart, for example, makes poverty wages), or were hired as contractors/gig workers with no benefits or job security.  The other fact that makes this problem unique and more precarious for US workers is the lack of a social safety net like guaranteed universal health care , higher unemployment benefits, and medical leave.  Instead, the US government has repeatedly, like the previous recession, supported corporations to the detriment of workers and small businesses.  Economists estimate that we are looking at least, five to seven years before GDP growth and unemployment numbers reach pre-virus levels.

I heard someone labeled “a top economist” (not really) say on CNN this morning, unemployment may reach fifteen to twenty percent.

Unemployment figures in the United States have always been a complete and absolute lie.

For every person counted in the unemployment system, there are four or five people who haven’t been able to get through to even start the process; others who’ve been denied unemployment on some corporation-favoring technicality; others who’ve given up after earnestly trying; others who could never collect in the first place (precarious or “gig” or temp workers, who now unfortunately make up a huge portion of the workforce).

So when you say “26 million” or “30 million,” you should be saying at least 40-50 million. Right?

But you don’t; you never do. Because the truth would “scare business.”

The truth is that we have an utter economic disaster and collapse on our hands now, which we are not going to recover at all from for a couple of years minimum, and slowly after that.

2020-05-07 13:08:56,"33 million unemployed Americans represents  more than 20% of the US population so why is Germany's unemployment a mere 3.5%?

The difference is management. German Chancellor Angela Merkel seized control of the crisis early on and employed science based technologies to mitigate the infection on their workforce. In her typically understated fashion and without bombast, she addressed Germany in a calm and reasoned manner and deployed all segments of their production capability to produce the test kits and treatment facilities. Working in tandem with S. Korea and Singapore, Germans had access to a tracing APP on their phones which kept them away from corona hotspots and informed people when they had been in contact with another person who eventually became infected. 

All Trump had to do was copy the work the Germans perfected but 6 months into the crisis, America is still wandering aimlessly, bouncing from one ill advised strategy to political ploys designed distract Americans from the terrible service they received from their worthless president & senate that failed to impeach him.

While you were doing your political rallies and playing golf in January and February, the virus spread undetected because your CDC failed to test and your Department of Health and Human Services failed to inventory its medical supplies and to warn states to do the same.

And even though your own medical experts agree with the majority of medical experts that the only way to restart the economy safely is to test, contact trace, isolate, and quarantine, you have disavowed any national responsibility for testing and you are encouraging states to reopen before they meet your Administration’s criteria.  

If you think the economy is going to come back to normal while the virus continues to loom over us, you are mistaken.  And the economy that returns is not ever going to be the way it was.  

Your strategies and handling of the pandemic will be used as examples of how to mismanage a crisis."

He has been badly failing the Presidential test for over three years.

It's no surprise that Trump directed his personal attorney to threaten legal action against the colleges and high school he attended if they publicly released his grades or standardized test scores.

“When I say conman, I’m talking about a man who declares himself brilliant but directed me to threaten his high school, his colleges and the College Board to never release his grades or SAT scores,” said Michael Cohen, Trump's former attorney.

TB is considered the #1 infectious disease affecting the world.  Approximately 10 million get it annually and 1.5 million die from it annually of a disease that is entirely treatable if caught early.  

So here is just one more example and a significant one of unintended consequences from the actions taken to try and stop the spread of COVID.  For every action there is an opposite and equal reaction appears will apply to the battle with a different highly contagious respiratory disease.

But you know what the one difference is between the two?  COVID is hitting developed countries where most of the press that is read and heard operates.  TB is a disease no longer having much of an impact in those countries. And the battle has been going on for decades yet no one shut done whole economies over it because, well, it is someone else's problem.

Context and reference frame is important I guess.  Not in my country not my problem. So when those who write on these pages of how terrible the loss of even a single life to COVID is (and it is) just remember that decisions made to save lives from COVID may simply transfer that loss."

It's the threat of another hazard that will impact many more people. Life has to start going on again.

On the financial side, Trump gloated how wonderful it has been that he sent millions of people a one-time $1,200 check as we see an explosion of unemployment and bankruptcy filings. We are in a depression. Handing people one check is less than a band-aid. We must adopt the European model of paying people at least 3/4 of their salaries. Yes, it will blow up the debt and deficit but that can be addressed eventually by increasing interest rates.

The employees benefitted by quick approval for unemployment, kept their health benefits, and their position was held for the future.

Data shows that poor and non-white communities are disproportionately affected by the virus. Donald Trump makes headlines every single day, meanwhile pieces on Joe Biden and other democratic figures have been buried, or just nonexistent. Really, coverage and buildup to this election has ground to a halt, yet it is only 6 months away. And while sound voting methods not guaranteed in most states, a resurgence of the virus is predicted by both the ""re-opening"" of the country, and the seasonal changes in the fall.

Donald Trump has every reason to plunge this country into further chaos for political gain, and everything he has done over the past four years convinces me that he is not morally or legally above doing just that. With a lack of federal or state leadership, the onus is now on the American people to limit the spread, push hard for mail-in voting, and to help those of us in need.

For  four months this has been known. Still, no action by this president.

But I see no real outcry from Democrats nor Republicans to force Trumps hand to address this as a major priority.  The networks should tell Trump that he is 'off the air' until he takes action....That will get his attention.

There's welfare for these companies and for the richest families and individuals in America and it's freely given.  Then when the rest of us need it it's too much trouble or it might lead us into thinking we don't have to work, or someone will take advantage (as if companies haven't).  

The song and dance the GOP performs to avoid helping Americans is shameful.  Their entire leadership should be replaced with human beings who have worked for a living, who have had to decide which bills to pay, who have experienced the pain of our wealth care system directly.  Their actions are one of the reasons why the wealth has left most Americans behind, forced others to work 2-3 jobs to make ends meet, and left most of us without enough money to save.  

If the GOP wants an economy that isn't moribund they'd better shake themselves out of their wrongheaded ideas and start to work on behalf of all Americans rather than just the Americans who elect them.

They expected that US tax payers will very generously support the unemployed which they promptly did, thank you, but for how long and with what purpose? It is high time we restart businesses, which should never have happened been shut down for more than one week to get adjusted to the CDC safety guidelines after which we could have said let the chips fall where they may with regard to COVID-19 deaths. Well the chips did fall where they have approaching 75,000 deaths in the USA but with simultaneous fall of the economy and the terrifying rise in unemployment. 

A significant number are being paid more in unemployment benefits than wages they received when they were working and it is not fair to those who receive less than when they were employed and were working.

2020-05-07 13:42:59,"Things are bad now, but I see real chaos ahead.  Trump knows that if he loses the election, he will be in jail within a year.  Republicans know they have run the country into the ground, and will do anything to suppress the will of voters and stay in power.  

I think there actually is a playbook here.  Let the situation get so bad that you have to declare some sort of martial law and end the democratic process.  It's entirely conceivable at this point."
2020-05-07 13:50:53,"The loosening of the restrictions necessary for epidemic containment will make the economy worse. It should be obvious that our economy will not function normally while an epidemic runs rampant. The quickest path to normality (or at least stability) is to get the epidemic under control. But we put that day farther and farther off because our country seems incapable of putting off the promise of instant gratification. What we are doing is trying to repaint the house while it is still on fire.

The death toll in just 3 months is double annual flu deaths and almost double annual traffic deaths, but we have also seen things containment procedures make a difference in places like New York. So the people who keep saying this is “just another cold or flu” and “open for business by Easter” need to take a break. They need to try listening to both science and common sense for a change."
2020-05-07 13:56:43,"Sending people a one time check does not build confidence in the economy.  Stop taxing Social Security, lower the cost of repaying student loans, and bring back the SALT deductions would provide many consumers with a greater sense of security and economic well being.

Instead of bailing out corporations with millions in assets, only spend money on small businesses, and start up companies.   They will move the economy forward. Remove the cost of commerce associated with internet access, free internet service, like we have free public highways. 

That would create the confidence we need to create permanent job growth.  Until that occurs, public work projects need to be created."

The United States has been through this before, its leaders have pulled Americans through.  But trump land, this is their first time. Their leader, the most magnificent, brilliant mind to have ever been born into human history, has no one to turn to.

However, it is my sincere belief that opening up the states and having people gather en mass is a mistake of catastrophic proportions.

His inability to use intelligence briefings and science to guide his response to this pandemic was only part of the problem.  The common thread with the Republican's inability to manage our economy is their top down belief of how money flows.  We need to tax the wealthy more, provide better services to us all, including: social safety nets, affordable healthcare and education, safe streets, and recreational opportunities in parks, the arts, and museums. 

Minimum wage and unemployment insurance payments should be sufficient to live off of.  The internet which is going to play a larger part in education and commerce should be free.

Actually, is not that difficult, if we elect people with just BASIC intelligence, honesty, courage, humanity, empathy, flexibility, ethics, ability to plan, etc. everything will be fine. In an emergency, most people with those qualities will rise to the situation and will provide, at least, adequate leadership. Of course, some better than others, but adequate in any case. If we just had a fair plan, things will be much better. It does not have to be excellent just fair to start and we improve it as we go. However, we keep electing people without minimum qualifications and wondering why we go from failure to failure. Keep safe!"

Trump needs chaos to thrive.  His campaign slogan is that only a Strongman can master the chaos—chaos which he in fact creates, though this goes unmentioned.

Meanwhile, lives are needlessly interrupted, overwhelmed, destroyed.  

With apologies to Susan Sontag, Trumpism is the true pandemic."
2020-05-07 14:05:30,"It is inevitable that the number of people identified as being or having been infected with the Corona virus is going to increase.  This number will be driven by expanded availability of accurate testing. The more important issue is how many people require hospitalization, how long those people have to stay in the hospital, what is the recovery percentage and what is the rate of mortality.  A NY hospital testing women arriving to deliver found that of 200 tested, non symptomatic, 39 tested positive, or 19.5%.  If that were extrapolated across the entire population it would show about 60 million people have been affected by the virus.  So does the infection rate mean all that much?"

How can any reasonable person (not even an economist) believe the economy will come roaring back by summer?  Who’s gonna be spending on anything other than food and shelter? Why would anyone buy something discretionary  today when they believe they may need that money to feed their kids in 6 months time. GDP will most likely not return to 2019 levels for 5 years. That’s the depth of the hole the virus has dug for mankind. There is no easy answer, no magic bullet, only hard slogging to rebuild what nobody knew was so fragile as the modern world order."

I was confident that someone who had devoted their life to public service, was well educated and had held positions of trust would be prepared for the toughest job on earth. I didn't consider a reality TV actor would be able to measure up. I don't regret my choice, but I wonder how Trump voters feel about theirs today?"
2020-05-07 11:03:49,"Trump has essentially thrown in the towel.  He has come to the conclusion that we, the public, are all warriors now and we must sacrifice our lives to maintain the economy.  We don't see him on the line of a meat packing plant or intubating a dying patient.  But more to the point, millions of people are getting terribly sick from this disease.  Some may even suffer permanent damage.  It can take many weeks to recover, all the while shedding virus.  This isn't the flu.  

Economies operate on demand.  People do not spend money if they are afraid.  We are not spending because A we don't have it to spend and B we are too afraid to spend it.

What would reduce the fear?  Faith in government.  Faith in leadership.  Our leader just threw in the towel.  He just shifts blame, accepts no responsibility, refuses to understand or is incapable of understanding and throws fits on Twitter.  Faced with these circumstances, why would any consumer start spending money, even if they did have it? They will not until we have a real leader in the White House."

Now I feel that as an ""old person"" I'm fading a little everyday, soon to become an invisible man. Us old folks are not needed in this Trumpian world, only the young and working and spending ones have the say these days. 

As a kid I would read comics of Superman who traveled to Bizzaro world where it was all backwards, sort of like today. Who would have guessed. I take walks often so as to remember what it was like before this new normal. Hoping that you too can do the same.

It is a calamity of unheard proportions in human history and requires full international cooperation. So far it has been treated as other pandemics which occurred in our lifetime. We need a true genial leader to help to solve this problem.
2020-05-07 14:50:47,"When discussing the high number of unemployment applications compared to previous years/recessions, I'm not sure we're seeing an apples-to-apples comparison. Because of the legislative changes made as to who can file for unemployment because of COVID-19, I'd expect the pool of eligible unemployment applicants to be significantly larger than prior years, which is likely contributing to the astronomically high number of unemployment applications. There's no doubt that lots of people are struggling in the economy, but we should be clear about the data we're using and how we benchmark it against history. If there is a way to solve for the specific COVID-19 legislative impacts on the unemployment data sets, it would be valuable to see that nuance when we discuss historical comparisons."

Does it mean that if I applied for unemployment 20 years ago for a few months that losing my job due to the pandemic doesn't count in the unemployment statistics?   What does ""first-time"" have to do with the fact that someone lost their job due to the virus.  Does this mean that unemployment is actually a great deal higher than has been reported?  What a frightening thought."
2020-05-07 14:08:40,"I keep seeing numbers from the ""experts"" like 50%-80% of people infected are asymptomatic.  So how deadly can this virus really be?  Answer -- not very much at all. We are pushing more and more people into abject poverty, widening the gap between rich poor and making millions of children go hungry or starve.  Is this really the right response?  Can we not make at risk people safe by taking other precautions.  And when does personal responsibility for maintaining a health body come into play anyway."
2020-05-07 14:14:03,"I don’t understand why the administration refuses to do the one thing that will get the economy restarted: Giving people a reason to feel that it is safe to go out and spend. Until testing and contact tracing becomes widespread and people can assess for themselves it is unlikely that sophisticated people, with money, will loosen the strings on their wallets. The administration seems to think it can lie, cajole, threaten people into feeling safe. And that’s a one-way ticket out of the White House on January 20th, 2021."

(4) Instances of young healthy people dying are horrible but still truly exceedingly rare: as of May 4 NYC death rate age 18-44 is 0.016%
(5) The spread is too advanced, the US government is too incompetent & mistrusted for contacting tracing at this point
(6) The economy isn't a just a fun game we play keep ourselves occupied. For better or worse it is the bedrock of society, and the necessity of it can't be wished away by people who want to hide under their beds for two years.

I now know that the president can basically do whatever he wants with only a minority of people supporting it."

What many apparently failed to grasp is that, absent martial law and full-on quarantining, there will still be many deaths even with stay-at-home orders and social distancing practices. So now you have mass unemployment, an unknown number of lives saved, and a lot of caskets. There's no mulligan here though. This was the menu item we chose. We picked the chicken and now they're out of the fish."
2020-05-07 14:02:28,"First, it's not about Trump. The horrific and capricious autocratic nature of the economic shutdown is a global phenomenon, clearly evidencing markers of one that was planned and coordinated by transnationals. 
Second, the virus is not some new outlier by comparison to other sometimes fatal respiratory illnesses, especially once one subtracts deaths in nursing homes, institutions that should have the least deaths rather than the most, were government control, health care professionals and sheltering indoors the correct path to mitigating pandemic. 
Third, the money being thrown at markets is primarily going into the pockets of the so-called elite, rather than being used for, say, creating a universal health care system or helping ordinary people. 
Fourth, the pretext for the lockdowns keeps devolving while governors continually extend their transmogrification of America from a free country to a totalitarian dystopia. 
Were this about preserving life, by the way, more would be said about the deaths caused by the shutdowns, a number that may well exceed the deaths from the virus by the end of the event.
Chaos is going to be the ultimate outcome of this wholesale impoverishment of a credulous people while taking away their social, political, academic, religious, economic and even basic natural freedom. 
What has transpired is a grotesque crime against humanity.

On CNN, all the experts are immigrants, highly educated and like our family totally committed to the American dream. Meanwhile, 45 implores, for the sake of his ""numbers"" a fearful population to go to work... which stretches logic, since nearly 40 million jobs have hollowed out from a mainly service economy rampant with inequalities and stagnant wages.

We will come out of this, and we will find a way to live with the continuing presence of this virus, and the one that is coming after this one, and the one after that. But we will not find a way back to what we've been doing, because what we've been doing was never sustainable.

Some of the people that die to the virus might have died anyway. There will also be less auto accident deaths probably. On the other hand people that may have gone to hospitals for other issues may not out of fear, and some of them could die.

America's past is checkered with serious challenges. 80 years ago, World War II caused America to become the salvation of global democracy. The supreme commander, Dwight D. Eisenhower, was a model of consistency and leadership. Eisenhower skillfully built a coalition of leaders with very different ideas, languages and customs. It was Eisenhower’s extraordinary ability to lead that won WW II.

In contrast, Trump’s performance in managing this threat has been deplorable. Any officer in WW II would have been replaced long ago with a track record like Trump’s. Instead of leadership, every foolish scheme concocted by Trump is designed to distract us from his terrible performance.
 
Every day Trump makes more mistakes costing more Americans their lives. He breeds chaos during a time when we should be working together. He incites people to disregard other’s health by refusing to wear a mask. Equally disappointing is the congress which condones his actions with their silence.

We have the tools to remove this worthless parasite. We don’t have to wait 7 months for an election or even 7 days. The 25th amendment permits us to immediately remove Trump.

Promising the pandemic will disappear. Refusing to be seen in a mask. Touting every stock market rise. Planning enormous stadium rallies. Inviting foreign election meddling.

When people are adequately protected, they will be able to return to the workplace in the knowledge that they are safe. When this happens, and in due course, the economy will have a chance to bounce back. But first, Americans need to be tested and given all the PPE they need for their safety in the workplace.

It seems to me that Trump is viewing this huge problem all wrong! He clearly views the pandemic as a nuisance, as something which will hinder his re-election; but he should be viewing it as an opportunity: an opportunity to demonstrate to voters and to the world his mettle. If Trump thought about this the right way, he could grow in stature because of the tragic circumstances, not be diminished by them."

BUT many feel that Trump's handling of the pandemic is worse than that of Pearl Harbor and 9/11. Instead of accepting his failure, Trump again trained his guns on China on Wednesday.

2020-05-07 14:28:05,"It is incomprehensible to me that President Trump doesn’t use this pandemic to demonstrate to Americans and to the world that he is in total control, by making sure that people can pay their bills, children don’t go hungry, and priority is given to public health and people’s safety rather than to the economy and Wall Street. 

When people are adequately protected, they will be able to return to the workplace in the knowledge that they are safe. When this happens, and in due course, the economy will have a chance to bounce back. But first, Americans need to be tested and given all the PPE they need for their safety in the workplace.

It seems to me that Trump is viewing this huge problem all wrong! He clearly views the pandemic as a nuisance, as something which will hinder his re-election; but he should be viewing it as an opportunity: an opportunity to demonstrate to voters and to the world his mettle. If Trump thought about this the right way, he could grow in stature because of the tragic circumstances, not be diminished by them."

Most folks will do what's best for themselves, and most people want to go on living without a plastic tube shoved down thier throat.

Yes we need to reopen. But Trump, who can't focus on more than one thing at a time..(ie: ""He couldn't focus on the coming pandemic because he was too busy fighting off impeachment!!!"")
can't figure that out.

Reopen with guidelines. That's it plain and simple.

A leader showing compassion for the thousands of families who have lost loved ones and the tens of millions who have lost or are about to lose their employment would be desirable. A leader who acknowledges the fear and  anxiety that most of us share, but who emphasizes and applauds the efforts of many to develop effective vaccines and antiviral agents and the selflessness of thousands of not only health care workers from EMS workers, those who clean hospitals and other public places, nurses, physical and respiratory therapists, and physicians, to millions who offer simple acts of kindness to neighbors and the less fortunate in their communities and  to the wider nation and world. A forward-thinking leader, who accepts healthcare as a human right, promotes development of non-fossil fuel consuming energy sources, international cooperation against the corona virus, a common threat to all of us, rather than militarism.

Increasingly, this country is devoted to revering two things: money (for the donor class) and freedom (for the rest of us, who are assured that, with freedom, we too can enrich ourselves).  For many yrs, those in power have quietly undermined public agencies like the CDC, FDA, FAA, IRS, EPA, and OSHA, our public schools, and unions. And, for the most part, most of the people in this country seem to like it, enamored of freedom and the chance to make big money, even though, in reality, these are distractions from the process by which the powerful are diverting more resources from us and to them. 

Long food lines tell the story of food insecurity in this wealthy country. Job security is not much better, as unemployment systems have succeeded in denying benefits to many eligible persons and underpaid workers are afraid to return to unsafe workplaces. 

At some point, the donor class will have squeezed so much out of the rest of us that we can't power the American consumer-led economy.  Maybe covid 19 has revealed that that point may not be far off."

Not one Home Depot employee I observed was wearing a mask and several immediately violated my social distance.

Contrary to their message, my order was not ready, curbside delivery was useless, so I had to forage thru the store to find alternatives.

Later I researched Home Depot's major shareholders and learned of that 1% who are Trump supporters so I offer two recommendations. When you enter an establishment that does not meet your safety requirements, LEAVE, and tell them why you are leaving. Second recommendation is to avoid providing business to any establishment whose principals contribute to Trump.

So it's time for Plan B.  Given that we can't track and trace ""just like"" a handful of island in the world, what is the plan?  To slow the spread so that everyone can have access to our hospitals if they need it?  Or to not get the virus at all?

Guess what? That is exactly how any CDC document has always been written. They don’t say things like “Maybe, if you feel like it, you could wait until the case numbers get to X, but you don’t have to do that if your businesses disagree”.

2020-05-07 15:44:11,"It's unfortunate that problems from unemployment will be amplified by a still-quite-flawed ACA.

One of the problems, ill-publicized, is that in many states, much ACA coverage isn't even insurance.

Specifically, the ACA expanded Medicaid, that covers perhaps half of people on the ACA, is, in at least 10 states (many of them blue like MA, MD, and NJ), for people 55 and over, subject to Medicaid estate recovery.

What this means is that peoples' medical bills are paid out for them now, but will be taken from their estates when they die.  This is really not what many expect--like many of us, they want to leave assets for their children.  So in those states, people 55 and older, who get expanded Medicaid (income to 138% of Fed. Pov. Lvl.) do not have insurance--they have a bomb in the form of only a loan until death for medical expenses.

This defect was publicized a bit in 2013 /2014, such as in The Atlantic, here: 

<a href=""https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2014/01/can-medicaid-really-come-after-you-house-when-you-die/357357"" target=""_blank"">https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2014/01/can-medicaid-really-come-after-you-house-when-you-die/357357</a>/ 

and, in fact certains states, like OR, WA, NY, VT, CA, and MN did fix their recovery laws to make all ACA coverage real insurance since 2013.  But many did not.

The problem could be fixed Federally, or statewise in the 10 states.  It should be done right now.

(For updates since 2104, see the Wikipedia article on Medicaid estate recovery.  Wikipedia is not, in itself, reliable, but sound references at the end of the article can be clicked on.)"

At this point the ""Will work for food"" signs will reappear, and the companies will _only_ hire the people carrying them. And they _will_ make them work for food! Unions? What unions?  Without dues the unions will collapse just as quick as the economy did. Labor laws? Let take Trump care of that. The same goes for minimum wage.

So these companies will make big, big profits - they think. But by not paying their slaves... erm... employees they won't get the money moving again. It will be a total misery, with nobody being able to buy anything because they are all working for just food, and therefor nobody being able to produce or sell anything except food.

This will lead to a _second_ economic collapse, and this time it's for real, because even the rich CEOs will suffer. But that's just capitalism for you! So, if there isn't a Second Civil War (SCW) because of ""freedom from masks"", and there isn't a SCW because Trump will lose in November, then there _will_ be a SCW because people and their kids go to bed hungry every day.

The world economy has always allowed auto deaths (which are down these days, because nobody's driving). The world economy has also always allowed deaths by the seasonal flu. Even though flu shots reduce one's odds of getting the flu by 40-60%, roughly half of US residents don't get flu shots.

They are exposing themselves and their families to illness, and even though they are being called ""heroes"", it does not do anything for their situations. 

Yes, Congress needs to extend the benefits of the CARES Act and pass the ""Heroes Fund"" and make the term mean something. Otherwise, it's as if these workers are just being rewarded for being able to have a job and having to be thankful for it, while big business gets more bloated with cash. Social distancing? Tell that to the erratic and reckless customers.

A friend of mine in my town was laid off from her minimum wage job eight weeks ago and has yet to see a penny in unemployment compensation from the State of Washington.  From what's I've read, the most successful states have managed to process only 60% of jobless claims, and the least successful, like Florida, are under 10%.  The states won't let these people make a living, but also won't help them get the unemployment compensation which they paid for by weekly deductions from their paychecks.  Whenever I hear Governor Cuomo or Governor Inslee pontificating on television about his state's response to Covid, all I can think is, ""Why aren't you out personally hand-delivering unemployment checks to your constituents?"""

>> While other countries open slowly and in ways to minimize risk, the United States opens faster, observing fewer guidelines. 

>> Within weeks, the US is in the grips of a second wave of the pandemic, even worse than the first.

>> As now, the virus refuses to observe geographical boundaries and nationalities. As long as coronavirus can spread, it can do so anywhere.

>> Doesn't this recklessness make the US an imminent danger to the whole world? Could other nations restrict travel and business with us? Could they fine or sanction us? Could the rest of the world officially condemn us somehow?"
2020-05-07 16:11:56,"This is perhaps the toughest challenge the US has faced since World War II.  We were lucky to have someone like FDR to lead the country at that time, certainly one of the best presidents the country has had, despite conservative attempts to revise that assessment in furtherance of present political aims (GOP good; Democrats bad; government bad; business good).

Now, facing a problem as daunting in its own way, we have someone with a short attention span, the inability to deeply comprehend, only motivated to be reelected and to make speeches to adoring crowds, and with not a single basic notion of what leadership means.

Trump cannot lead the country out of this morass and he knows it, but he is too proud to resign.  So we must suffer through this in a piecemeal fashion, haphazardly, with no more than local or state level coordination.  The 3 AM call has happened and as was completely expected, even by many who voted for Trump, we didn't have anyone to pick up the call.

To those who voted for Trump: please, seriously consider questioning your judgement and if you find your judgement lacking, sit out the next election so voters with better judgement can try to patch things together.  And, looking back over the past several decades, perhaps your votes for the GOP were not so wise.  Choose more wisely."

Or will they be permitted to go about their daily routines wearing masks and practicing social distancing until they are cleared?

2020-05-07 16:09:36,"Here, in Alberta, we have suffered the largest single Covid 19 outbreak in North America at the Cargill meat packing plant in High River. Against all advice, without legislation to prevent it, the plant kept operating (along with other facilities) with barely any steps being taken to mitigate the virus. As a result, around 1,000 workers, mostly of low paid, foreign, origins, have been infected and one has died prompting a provincial fatality inquiry.

This morning, PM Trudeau announced a wage top up for essential workers in minimum wage professions, working on the basic premise that workers will be pliable for a handful of shekels before employers are required to reduce their profits in lieu of safety expenditures which should have been paramount without a pandemic. At what point will those wages be clawed back? As soon as a vaccination or a cure is available? Are those workers at that point no longer considered essential? Are they obliged then to recede back into the abyss of wage slavery? It will be a brave politician that orders pay cuts in these sectors.

We are now suffering capitalism’s curse, compounded by tragedy, for which the repercussions of decades of exploitation will now be duly revealed with exquisite clarity. The future need not be a depression as long as workers receive their due. Employers will recoil at the prospect of meeting these wage demands without government assistance, but the reality is that Covid 19 may well have partly chastened capitalism."
2020-05-07 16:32:46,"So many states that are reopening are not meeting the White House guidelines for reopening. Of note is how many are showing increases in virus cases when the guidelines said that reopening should only occur with sustained decreases in cases.

Remember the governors who said it is illegal and unconstitutional for the President to tell the states what to do. There is much to put on the President but this is not one of those decisions. Ironically it could be the one that sets everything back and we lose all the gains that have been made."
2020-05-07 16:23:56,"The situation in the USA gets more bizarre every day. Trump seems determined to follow the exact opposite paths of the nations who have actually managed to flatten the curve, and are now VERY slowly re-opening services, with dire warnings of immediate  closure if cases begin to surge again.But the USA  chooses to ignore these cautions. The second wave, coming next month in America won't be in the big metro areas, it will be worst in red states who somehow feel that exercising their ""rights and freedoms"" will be enough to protect them. I could easily see 200,000 American Covid deaths by December, and it could be even higher. And theres a presidential election in the thick of this. What happens with that? Does it even take place?

Of those who tested positive, 90% ""reported being unable to work from home."" ""Ninety percent of the people who were PCR positive had no capability of working from home during shelter in place. These were frontline workers that had to work outside of the home""

""Overly"" is a subjective description and when viewing these guidelines through a political lens one can see why the WH wants simple easy to read/ follow rules. But, there is nothing simple about this virus and the CDC seems to have provided thorough and well designed, step by step, guidance to allow businesses to open in the face of the inherent complexities. I think it would behoove the WH  to publish the guidelines and allow the states to implement them as they see fit. That way people get back to work ASAP and we have regional/local control and oversight."

At some point, probably in the next 6-12 months, we will have a vaccine or a cure. Do people really think it makes sense to shut down the economy that long? Have you begun to imagine the consequence of doing that? In the meantime, we need to find a way to manage this disease and get back to work. Millions are doing it today. I never stopped going to work."

1. Ample, free, fast testing. 

2. Use Defense Production Act to make enough PPE for all frontline workers, especially those in healthcare and in residential setting where the virus can spread quickly (nursing homes, prisons, homeless shelters, group homes).

3. Limit travel. Keep hotels & Airbnbs closed and restrict air travel until this crisis is seriously under control. (The NYT had an article today about how travel to/from NYC lead to most of the outbreaks around the country!)

4. Continue to ban large gatherings (church, concerts, plays, sporting events) -- unless they can find a way to limit the numbers. The numbers can slowly edge up if we don't see a resurgence.

5. Do whatever you can to open schools, open them safely, and keep them open. There are 55 million school-aged kids in this country. They deserve an education and opportunities for social development, and their parents deserve to have their children be cared for and educated while they work. contribute"

It is likely that hundreds working in and around the White House were also exposed including many executive branch officials.  Trump just took a trip to Arizona where he exposed many people along the way including the crew of Air Force One and many Arizona officials including the governor.

Ask for volunteers in soup kitchens and delivering meals to the ill. Ask companies to sew masks . But give everyone some money to live . Does it really matter now that China was secretive and that New York did not close down quickly enough? Unfortunately what is happening now   with the push back and re openings is a calculated risk that the deaths and illnesses  won't be so great as to dampen the American consumer . So what your grandma, Dad or cousin die  or loses a few toes or a foot at least you can get your new shoes and the Las Vegas hotels and casinos are full .

  After allowing for an accelerated extemporaneous opening of favored businesses and group meetings within States that have Republican Governors, will the Mad Hatter in the White Houses' distaste for prescriptive measures rapidly devolve into also challenging the lines of authority that our US Constitution provides the Governors of ALL States of the Union in emergencies; reasoning that the Constitution itself is ""Overly Prescriptive""?"
2020-05-07 15:48:28,"Trump is quick to call U.S. workers ""warriors"".

“This was avoidable. These are unnecessary deaths (100 healthcare workers in the UK as of April 20). It’s not a ‘war’. This is a health crisis. This is systemic negligence. I’m not a warrior. And none of us should have to ‘sacrifice’ ourselves to do our jobs.""
I hope U.S. workers - in whatever industry - see that their leaders are blackmailing them to go back to work (by refusing any financial assistance to stay safe), thus putting the workers and their loved ones in harm's way."

Now that it is clear that hundreds of thousands, not tens of thousands, of Americans will die from COVID-19, and that the pandemic will continue into November, what will happen next in America?  Trump will attempt to postpone the election, or if the election is held in November he will overtly support voter suppression in blue districts and challenge the results if/when he loses.  He will do anything to stay in power.  Then what?"

2020-05-07 16:17:45,"Someone from the CDC should (discreetly and anonymously) leak the rejected guidelines to multiple reputable news outlets. THAT would be a tremendous public service, something this corrupt administration knows nothing about.

And next time Trump speaks to the media, he should be pressed to explain how re-opening businesses won't lead to:
- a resurgence in cases
- the further overwhelming of an already over-burdened healthcare system
- unnecessary risk to the of our nations medical personnel, as well as the general population
- and by extension of all of the above, a renewed wave of economic catastrophe, the very thing he purports to want to avoid (but I guess he'll insist none of this is his fault).

It is my sincerest wish that enough of his 2016 supporters understand that their welfare is nowhere on his priority list, and help vote him out of his office. And I hope discerning people everywhere see the senselessness in his actions, and take measures to stay alive and healthy.

The purpose of this committee is a little unclear; I thought it was only going to monitor how money is being spent, not do a looksey into how the Trump Administration ignored the early intelligence and refused to accept the WHO test kit that would have enabled the CDC to get in front of the pandemic.

Also, I would hope the Committee would look at the long relationship USA has had with the Wuhan Lab; Fauci's group, the NIH, did invest 3.5  million dollars into the lab to do corona virus research that that is illegal in the United States due to the danger. And there is the early report that the SARS Cov2 has snippets of HIV DNA embedded in it.

We will never win this war if we don't follow the science and the guidance of the medical professionals.  Trump has managed to politicize the CDC and regrettably it has polluted even this venerable agency. Sadly we now have to question the CDC's pronouncements and wonder if they are giving us their honest scientific prescription or what Trump wants to publicize.  The CDC is now less transparent and their people have been muzzled. When the history is written on this pandemic and how Trump administration handled it, we will see it was a disaster from day one and riddled with selfish decisions and outright corruption."

Up to the pandemic, the costs have been, the environment, the Supreme Court, human decency/unity, the economic welfare of the middle and lower classes, the justice system, to name a few.  In our ‘new reality’ the stakes are even higher.  Peoples lives must now be sacrificed in a fruitless attempt by November to get the economy limping and unemployment claims down, (his only claims to fame) so he has a shot.  The irony of a faster reopening is completely counterproductive by virus standards and his supporters by in large are the  standard bearers.  What a delicate balancing act, keeping enough of his supporters alive to keep him in office.  The real tragedy besides prolonging this mess is the toll it will take on all of our essential workers.  So many must die or have prolonged health effects to keep this poor excuse in office."

Is this a reasoned gamble that the economy will revive?  Unfortunately not.  This President just “feels” the CDC should step back.  HE wants business as usual. I fully believe he is incapable of assessing/understanding the nation’s - much less the world’s death rate risks.

The job of scientists and doctors is not to make policy.  It is to use our experience and judgment to analyze data and then make recommendations based on it.  It is the job of elected politicians to take these recommendations, analyze and assess them, and then make policy decisions they think are appopriate.

This article describes a system that works exactly as it's supposed to.  The CDC makes recommendations, the administrations (governors of different parties as well) assess the recommendations and ask for clarifications or changes.  The professionals at the CDC take these requests and re-assess the data and produce new modified recommendations.

What does the NYT think would happen differently with a Democratic administration?  When presented with data during other national crises, for example World War II, did FDR start preparing for an eventual war?  No, of course not. 
Politically it wasn't practical.  He had an election in November 1940 and if he'd started drafting soldiers he'd have lost the election.

Did we pay for this decision with American lives?  Absolutely.  We started WWII losing the Phillipines and battles in Asia (Java Sea) and Europe (Kasserine Pass).

This article describes exactly how politics have worked as far back as anyone alive can remember.  That it is considered an indictment of this administration and none other demonstrates bias reporting."

According to Worldometer, Georgia remains in the middle of the pack, and Oklahoma remains near the bottom.

A multimillionaire going belly up multiple times is like a person getting obese. It doesn’t happen overnight. Little choices add up to massive weight gain. So when they finally address the problem, it’s much bigger than it had to be. Can’t just look in the mirror and think okay, I’m tired of being Fat Thor so I’m moving on from this, back to svelte Thor, then think poof, all the excess weight will magically vanish. It takes time and hard work to deal with it.

But a narcissist is not willing to invest the time and hard work. They just move on to something else. They might justify their new obese state by saying they have a hormone imbalance or something, anything to justify not having to stand and deal.

Trump doesn’t know how to stand and deal. But we already knew this. We knew it by his multiple marriages, affairs, bankruptcies, failed business ventures etc. etc. etc. I’m just exhausted by all of this! I wish we had a time machine to take us to November so that we could stop living in a constant state of anxiety. I’m not even a frontline worker. I have it easy working from home. And yet I have more stress right now than I’ve ever had. I can’t imagine how frontline workers feel, and of course those who are infected, those with sick and dying loved ones, those who are hungry, jobless. Ah it makes my heart hurt."

We are all being thrown under the bus, drafted to fight to the very death in order to shore up the economy and shore up Trump's chances of winning the election.  He was never equipped nor prepared for the role of leadership required to navigate a Presidency, let alone a crisis of epic proportions.  He failed to understand that being President required more than holding rallies and being cheered by his worshipful fans, (which is what most of his Presidency has amounted to).  He was always in way over his head, so when the crisis hit, he was first in denial, then decided he wasn't going to take any responsibility for managing it, nor assume the role of leadership, so he punted and left it up to the states.
To that end, Governor Cuomo has been the de facto the leader we should have had in a President, giving updates that are pertinent and to the point, speaking coherently, and never making ill considered suggestions that COVID-19 might be treated by injecting disinfectants or treated with taking drugs not approved for treatment of the virus.
We have a patchwork quilt of ever state for itself.  There is no cohesive policy.  We are on our own.  We are saddled with a wrong, woefully ignorant President, at the wrong time, much to the detriment of this country.  The way forward is murky at best until there is a vaccine.  Good luck to us all.

Words aren’t magic. A person’s actions are the best way to take a measure of their intentions and competence. Republicans are choosing to abandon an activist Federal intervention in public health and economics. This reflects their ideology, a fantastic idealization of how the world “should be” not the world as it is.

These states that follow these Pied Pipers will be led astray: I predict Covid-19 will smolder in small rural communities, the Republic base, for months and months if they relax public health restrictions.

Too many people really do think “the government,” which somehow does not include the White House or any Trump appointees, is full of people who hate America. I don’t understand how someone could rail against the government, yet support the President, who leads the government. 

The piece today about the White House asking the CDC to change its guidelines for reopening the country points to the power of the White House. 

If government is out to get you, my fellow Americans, I don’t know how you can think the Trump Administration isn’t in on it. The argument isn’t logical. 

Government is made up of people, most of whom are civil servants, men and women who have sworn an oath to uphold our Constitution and to fight against enemies, both foreign and domestic. They take the oath seriously. 

So if anyone is out to get you, I would safely assume it isn’t the person who has served our country faithfully for their entire career, as most of those in the CDC have.

Trump is responsible for the desperate circumstances these citizens are in because his failure to take protective action at an early stage against COVID-19, has resulted in this virus escalating and killing more than 70,000 US citizens and causing a shutdown in the economy. The two things are inextricably linked.
For a US President to advocate people returning to work with no effective vaccine, rising infection, no effective treatments and importantly no taxpayer funded health care to treat the victims of this disease, is a crime against his own people. 
For Trump to openly admit that people will have to die in order for a swift return to work to take place when questioned about this, demonstrates a callousness against his own people which is unprecedented. 
In the UK we have a similar leader in Boris Johnson, who took no protective action against the encroaching deadly threat of COVID-19 until the 23rd of March when a lockdown was imposed in the UK. The only thing we are leading in now is having the greatest number of deaths in Europe of over 30,000 people.

I’d prefer 2nd degree Murder.  I was still elated.  The law would finally ensnare Trump & Senate (R)’s  could not prevent it.

I wrote Professor Bruce Ackerman (Yale) if Kirscher’s assertion is permissible under the constitution.

He responded, “Over the course of his four years, Trump has engaged in many actions that could precipitate criminal prosecutions after his departure from office. Nevertheless, I think such prosecutions would set a very bad precedent – legitimating further efforts to prosecute future presidents, especially when they are succeeded by presidents from a different political party. 

“The crimes of future presidents might be much less significant & far harder to prove – remember Monika Lewinsky?

2020-05-07 17:15:46,"I plead with all Democrats and, especially progressive Sanders supporters, to show up and vote for Democrats up and down the ballot.  There is simply too much at stake in this election.  It is not hyperbole to say that the future of this country and, perhaps, the world depends on the outcome. If Trump wins 4 reelection, the country as we know it will be unrecognizable.  Progressives should internalize the following:
1) The Supreme Court and every single circuit will be stacked with a majority of right-wing ideologues. Even if a Democratic president wins in the future, any progressive legislation will be killed. Needless to say, Roe v Wade, voting rights, etc will be history.
2) All sensible environmental safeguards will be destroyed resulting in irreversible damage.
3) Our healthcare system will be completely destroyed along with protections for preexisting conditions.
3) Our alliances all around the world will be destroyed and authoritarians like Xi, Putin, etc to wield much greater power.
4)  The existing divisions in the country along class, racial and ideological lines will be further exacerbated likely irreversibly.

I could go on.  We cannot afford to be distracted by false equivalencies like in 2016.  This is the mother of all elections!"
2020-05-07 17:15:47,"Trump can edit the CDC's reopening guidelines as much as he wants, or even not release them at all. It won't matter because there is nothing Trump can do to restore confidence. Trump is inept beyond belief; most people rightly don't trust him. Covid cases and deaths are rising and will continue to do so through the summer at least, and a majority of the American public thinks that we are rushing too fast to lift restrictions. The rest of the world's economy is sliding into a depression and will drag America down with it no matter what. People are smart to stay home as much as they can and save as much money as they can because nobody knows how or when this will end. A democratic sweep in November would go a long way toward restoring confidence that the country is in steadier hands, but the election is 6 months away. I don't think we'll see any sustained improvement in the national mood until then. And God help us if Trump wins."
2020-05-07 17:17:05,"Why does the White House think that places with a minimal number of cases will stay that way if their guidelines for reopening are relaxed. Resurgences in Japan and other countries, and now resurgences in many US locations, suggest otherwise. The continued soft, wishy-washy, overly generous guidelines that the WH seems to favor will cause the infections and deaths to continue for much longer than necessary. Look to Germany for an example of a large country that does things much more rigorously but much more successfully. Germany is more strict yet will open businesses long before the US will."

And then let them proceed to any nail salon, bowling alley, sports arena, or beach, and let them enjoy the lifestyle that they are pushing the rest of the country to enjoy.  Think what this would do for the economy!  Until we start burying people.  Lots of people.  Way more than we have buried already (with notably no ""thoughts and prayers"" coming from the president of the United States toward the loved ones of the 70,000+ who have already died on his watch)."
2020-05-07 17:29:43,"Trump has chosen to opt for the most frictionless reopening he can obtain, regardless of scientific guidance.   He’s made a conscious choice that more lives must be lost in order to convey a veneer of normalcy in the Red and battleground states, ahead of the November election.   

I’m certain that Trump strategists would privately acknowledge that there will be accelerated spread of the virus, but given lower population densities in states critical to Trump’s electoral prospects, the trajectory will be slower - and perhaps not too overwhelming on Election Day.   To them, this is just a necessary cost of making the boss competitive in November.

As for the harder hit states up North, well... they’re lost to Trump anyway.    

And as for those killed by the virus?   They don’t get a vote."
2020-05-07 17:31:55,"Big things missing in the Guidance, thanks NYT for providing it. Childcare seems a big issue, but most of the people clamoring to re open seem to be sole proprietors of small businesses, who can do without those employees who need childcare; and there is nothing about Nursing Homes. Nursing homes are the weak link in quarantine, because instead of being in quarantine in an infected home, employees are free to leave and go to the grocery store, and do whatever they like, especially non medical staff and per diem  employees from employment services, who bring thier germs to the next job. Crack down on Nursing homes NOW, for 14 days, and then try reopening everything else. Nobody in and nobody out, except, healthy elderly should be moved to a different building with different staff. Is this mean? Driving these sole proprietors into bankruptcy is really mean too."

I don't think they should be jailed either, heavily fined, do many hours of community service and maybe under house arrest but sigh, no partisan support.  Salon owner's  sentence wasn't onerous and all that can do is lead to lawlessness and higher outbreaks and as people find out that they can not only change laws by demonstrating but openly flout laws and get away with it, but then (since it's mostly the Republicans) maybe they don't care as many of the people succumbing to the disease (black, Latino, minorities, people in close living situations like prisons) are not likely to vote their way."

If the government, from the Trump administration on down (I really should say on up, because they have set such a low bar), thinks things will be back to normal just because they say so, they are sadly deluded. 

I am putting money into the economy by paying my hairdresser, supporting local small businesses, and yes, ordering needed goods from Amazon. But I'm not going to mingle in a restaurant, in a store, at a concert, until it's safe to do so. That could be a long time in the future. 

I believe it is the government's job to support those who have suffered during this crisis. They are already cutting off the meager unemployment and SBA safety nets. They are expecting workers to sacrifice their health by not providing the necessary PPE and other safety measures to ensure they are healthy."

Once both guys recovered, the bets were off.  Wealthy white people see little to fear...they are not worried... the corona virus does not come for them.

2020-05-07 17:47:16,"It is likely not a coincidence that the leading two nations headed by populist demagogues and nincompoops, the US and Britain, have the highest death tolls in the world due to Covid 19. Both have dabbled with so called “herd immunity,” although Britain has balked at the the atrociously apparent consequences of the experiment after many thousands of needless deaths which still occur each day.

I can’t help but perceive a stream of social Darwinism pervading the policies of these respective governments not out of line with previous tyrannies that were content to murder their own people and oppress others because of monstrous faux science. Johnson has probably been chastened by his own illness, but also the likelihood that the British are not quite as ideologically susceptible as their transatlantic counterparts.  

Trump and Johnson are odious throwbacks to  days best left bygone. However, they are simply faces of this emerging new political credo that outstrips mere neoconservativism in its rapaciousness, ruthlessness, dishonesty, and utter incompetence.  In the past, it was called Nazism; it is certainly fascism in one form or another.

Fortunately, it can be countered. The US and UK have statesmen in waiting in the wings, Joe Biden and Sir Keir Starmer, who will have the political gravitas and popular clout to reset society to where it should be as soon as the appalling policies of these respective administrations stand for proper examination.

Do we need a lesson in what those symbols represent?  Perhaps we need a daily reminder of the disproportionate amount of power that this hateful minority holds over the majority of the country's politics.  Face it, if the death toll is predominantly black and brown, that's a plus for deep red states.

Or is it the guy who pushed the endless e-mail investigation that, again, found no actionable wrongdoing? Neither of those hearings, of course, involved 60,000 potentially preventable deaths and climbing. As Stalin noted, ""One death is a tragedy. A million deaths is a statistic."""

That is a blanket summary of Trump's style of leadership.

The Banana Republic continues, with the most miserably un-presidential president in our history...certainly in my long lifetime.  Trump wants an echo chamber of toadies, and no accountability, responsibility....nothing.  He is desperate to be reelected and can’t control his partisan tongue even to basic civility and decency.  A panel of this sort should be bipartisan....50/50....with both sides being heard.  Otherwise, it is worse than meaningless."

That'd be too much to expect from a man with no empathy and no courage whatsoever.

But I took the time to read through draft CDC guidelines linked in this article, and I'm sad to say that they almost entirely unworkable. A plan for re-opening that depends on  indoor spaces being much larger and better ventilated than they really are, that depends on there being twice as many educators as there really are, is not a viable plan. There's a decent chance that this plan could actually be harmful.  By proposing safety guidelines that are detailed, but not even remotely achievable, we incentivize early re-opening by allowing institutions to check some sub-set of boxes, providing evidence of due diligence, without actually yielding safety. The administration rejected the guidelines because they are ""too prescriptive"".  Paradoxically, the real fault is that they are not not *restrictive* enough.  We have to come to terms with the fact that there may not be a safe way to re-open schools, summer camps, etc... while the disease is still actively spreading."

My parents said the same. I say the same. My husband and I are in high-risk demographics. We hurting economically; I can work from home, but he can't. Income from my second job, a part-time position, ends this month. But so far, we are alive. 

We negotiated modified payments on our credit cards, car loans and with ConEd, and will approach our mortgage lender next month. Thus far, no one has said ""no."" Our town provides shopping services for seniors and other high-risk people, a food bank, and emergency aid for anyone in financial distress (advice, contacts, pro bono assistance). It can be done.  

Trump and the GOP has decided not to save lives. Much of my anxiety arises from the fear that, at some point, the Governor may be pressured into complying with the GOP's deadly reopening policies. I think that, as the death toll soars, the Trump administration will try, first, to conceal the totals, and when that fails, to depict the numbers as ""false news.""

Blatantly, The Times is giving the reader misleading, but technically correct, information. Yes, it is true, “[Covid-19] case counts are trending upward,” in some states initiating the “reopening” of the economy; however, this fact is misleading. Though The Times’ favorite statistic, the total number of Covid-19 cases, is historically important for calculating the total effect that the outbreak had on the United States and the world collectively, it is not an accurate representation of how detrimental of an influence the virus is currently having on a particular population. Pessimistic media organizations around the globe, like The Times, practically fetishize the statistic for one simple reason, it never improves; courtesy of never subtracting closed cases - rather that’s death or recovery - media organizations can  easily narrativize a seemingly ever worsening - but most importantly, intriguing - Coronavirus situation, to their devout adherences. Particularly, in this situation, the new cases per day, in “reopening” states, would’ve proven substantially more significant; a majority of these bell curve’s have already been “flattened.” As a ‘20 high school senior, do not blindly fall susceptible to every “news” report"

Closing businesses, social distancing, stay at home orders only delay the inevitable. There will be more cases and more deaths until herd immunity is established. The only motivation to remain closed is purely political. Democrats want the closures and resulting pain to last until the election.  They want the economy to tank to win back the White House and possibly the Senate.  Note that red states are opening at a much faster rate than blue states. But the Democrat's plans are beginning to backfire. Protests and acts of anarchy are beginning to erupt. Governor Cuomo announced to his shock that 2/3 of new Covid-19 hospitalizations in New York were people he told to stay at home. The country will reopen fully with no cure and no vaccine.

From attempts at denying Americans health care to taking food from their mouths with curtailments of food stamps, to now, McConnell pushing for tort reform to provide immunity to murderous business owners who would kill many by other means if they opened, The Republicans are the party of death.

All the focus on Trump should be shared on McConnell who has been in the Senate through many administrations."

In crises, some people rise to the occasions, and others crumble. Trump has crumbled. 

He is unfit to lead anyone in a crisis. He is incapable of doing anything constructive for us, or for our governors, or for our healthcare personnel. He has proven his uselessness again and again, while also refusing to allow experts to guide us.

As if that weren’t enough, Trump is also unable to show any emotion, empathy, or concern for the families of more than 74,000 Americans who have died, or for over 30 million Americans who have lost their jobs. 

Should we be surprised? Trump is the same empty husk of a human being who, in 2016, mocked the parents of a U.S. Army captain who was killed in Iraq.

Trump’s self-absorption knows no bounds.

Bullying, mocking, and sophomoric rallies are useless to Trump now. Don’t waste your hopes on him. Vote him out of office on Nov. 3rd."

Oh, Mexico will pay for the wall with tariffs.  Interesting.  Before this is pulled again, I think that we the people need to see the accounting demonstrating that Mexico is paying for the Wall.  As for businesses being given money to come back to the US.  Forget that.  They left the US out of greed and more profits by exploiting cheap labor.  It is time for them to show their loyalty to the US and use some of those profits to move themselves back here and maybe let less greed enter into their next decision to move out again.  It would also be acceptable to feed a whole lot of starving people by paying for transport of all the food farmers are trashing and get it to the people.  I think there are a few immigrants who would have no problem butchering a pig to feed their family."
2020-05-07 18:20:52,"I believe that the White House rejected the CDC guidelines as being prescriptive because the inhabitant of the residence either can’t or won’t read more than three lines at a time. While, perhaps they are not perfect, the CDC guidelines present a clear, logical way to safely reopen our country. While the President has said each Governor should enact its own reopening guidelines, my state will do whatever the President dictates. 


Yesterday I wrote our Governor, Doug Ducey, asking him to do what is right for our state. We are seeing our largest spike in infections and deaths sine the beginning of the pandemic. Governor Ducey has decided to follow along with whatever the president says even when it is not in the best interests of the people of Arizona. 

I suggest that the least each of us can do is to write to our respective governors and demand they give us the best possible chance to stay alive. We know that stay at home orders have worked in reducing infections in many locations. We also know that lifting restrictions before the curve is flattened will kill more of us. 

I wish no evil come to the President but I wish he felt the same about me. 

Stay safe so you can be well.

Then they will start to get sick and a sub-set start needing healthcare resources that will not be there because the deniers will stop preparing. They can't abide by having reminders around. Then they will say it was unpredictable. - Cassandra"

!. FDA has rejected the covid-19 test license invented by a virology lab researchers at UW in early February. ( The country desperately needed the diagnostic test at that time. )
2. When Trump touted, "" hydroxychloroquine "". FDA approved for experimental trial the next day.
3. On top of Trump administration trimmed the budget for CDC, they have to modify the PPE guideline for front line health professionals for facial masks instead of N-95. Now CDC has to revise the Federal guidelines to re-open the economy to fit into Trump's "" Gut feeling "" against safety and science.

Perhaps the president and his minions actually like the idea of Americans dying in droves, with over 70,000 succumbing to the Corona virus so far. Perhaps they want to break records in this regard. So far they have projected 134,000 deaths, but Trump is into holding records, so it’s possible that he’s trying to surpass his own prediction. It is also possible that Trump believes that only Democrats are dying, and I’m sure that he has the evidence to prove it. Is his stupidity worth even one American life?  Trump is no leader. His heel spurs preclude him from commanding men and women at war, so it is apparent that one should do the opposite of whatever Trump says. We should keep a safe distance, wear masks, wash our hands, and follow the guidelines set forth by the medical professionals at the CDC. This will insure our safety.

Sweden: 29
France: 39
UK: 46
Italy: 49

NY State: 100
NY City (confirmed deaths): 169
NY City (confirmed plus probable deaths): 233

If you read the NYT, you may find these stats surprising. They show in an astounding way how badly NY has performed compared to the world - more than three times as many deaths as Italy for a given population using the more conservative ""confirmed"" estimate! And NYC's hospitals did not become overrun as Italy's did. 

If the President were a Democrat and the NY State Governor and NY City Mayor were Republicans, no doubt you would be hearing a rosy (or at least honest) assessment of how the US is doing compared the rest of the world (not as good as Germany, but much better than most hard hit European nations) and how truly terrible NY has performed.

The House has been stymied and the Senate has bent over in submission to his highness. The solution may be this Trump Virus.

Indeed, good news.

Except even if we assume a lot more people than reported have contracted the virus, it might no more than 10 or 20 million.

But this will encourage Trump to open things up even more, and especially inspire those who have subtlety said that since it will happen anyway to the most vulnerable, we should let the virus spread since the net return on opening the economy will be much greater than the costs of their lives."

2020-05-07 19:24:36,"The wise embrace the totality...
The forced shutdown rather ironically serves to free people from pointlessly working their lives away. I've always said most jobs were unnecessary or even harmful and it turns out the government apparently now agrees with me.
While the political 'we' is an incoherent concept, ever and always a quick marker of group-think and fallacious reasoning, the individual is real and now more clearly 'doomed' to be free to choose their respective fates.
Meanwhile, the government/financial beast will find itself slowly starved, going forward, something that will no doubt mollify some old-fashioned conservatives as they watch the extant money and power grab. The power brokers are eventually going to be hoisted on their own petard, so no tea party will be required.
Success in life is not about money, anyway, something many would never discover without being forced to countenance the stillness and solitude that is so elusive to compulsively busy working people. 'Retiring' early is not the worst thing in the world. Neither is being poor when the most popular alternatives are debt and servitude."

However, I am not going anywhere anytime soon. No restaurants, stores (other than grocery), barbers, you name it. I do not think I am unlike anyone else with any smarts who will not/does not feel safe until we have testing, remedies, vaccines, etc. My buddies and I had to cancel our yearly NY Yankee fest and we all agree we will re-visit in 2021...of course that depends on what 2021 looks like.

2020-05-07 19:54:35,"There are many stories to this virus pandemic.  For the US, it is very much a regional outbreak, some parts of the country have been hit really badly like NYC, but some rural areas are virtually untouched.  

For those that can work from home and retain their salary, life is pretty good.  You can sleep in a bit more, avoid the commute, and never be late for dinner.  

But for those whose livelihood depends on the economy being open, ie retail, restauranteurs, hospitality, entertainment they are struggling mightily.  And if you are a restaurateur in a place of the country not hit hard by the virus, I can see their frustration.  I can see why they are willing to take a 1% chance with their life and open the economy vs. filing for personal bankruptcy, defaulting on their home, moving their kids out of school etc.  

Recessions cause death too, just not with much media coverage as this.  

This virus is a difficult thing to manage politically given the huge difference of experiences Americans are having.  

One thing is clear is that those places untouched by the virus or barely touched, you are that way because of the lockdown, so dont forget that."
2020-05-07 20:02:01,"""Another 3.2 million people filed for unemployment benefits last week, and ... more than 25% of workers are unemployed""

I am afraid the weekly unemployed numbers we are given here and elsewhere fall short in providing one the big picture.  It happens that one can get that by a back-of-the-envelope calculation. 

When the economy is good, most large companies hire new employees, getting ready for expanding markets and securing new projects.  There are other benefits in having some excess work force in house, e.g. keeping salaries in check and conveying that no one is indispensable. For some aggressive companies the excess workforce may account up to 20 to 25% of their work force. 

When the economy is in decline, large companies quickly restructure to adopt to shrinking markets and reduced demand.  The ""restructuring"" often means laying off up to third, and sometimes up to 40%, of their workforce.

Now, when a red-hot economy suddenly becomes highly depressed, the companies have their excess workforce plus part of their main workforce to lay off.  Based on the above numbers, a large company could easily lay off up to 60% of its workforce.

Using the 2018 statistics, around 155 million people are employed in the United States.  Adjusting the above number for 2020, one can conclude that, within the next six months, the number of unemployed in the US could exceed 95 million!"

The canard of religious freedom and economic expediency is a talking point that makes his base happy but risks more deaths to eke out a few points in a poll among his base. Religious freedom means you get to worship unmolested in the manner of your choosing. It is not carte blanche to impose your views and behaviors on others. If any organization engages in behavior that endangers the other members of society the social contract limits that freedom and rightly so.

Unfortunately there is no deployable vaccine against COVID-19 and there is a lot of hype and no cattle (modified from All hat and no cattle) about unproven vaccines and getting beaucoup tax payer funding like 456 million from BARDA for Moderna which I heard first mentioned by Dr. Anthony Fauci. 

It is time the white house rejects advice and reopening guidelines from the CDC that kill Jobs and does not really achieve the goals of safety such as safe distancing and wearing of masks properly, hand washing etc. Sanitizers are still not available after 3 months now and I see a lot of people wearing masks that slip under their noses and not covering their nostrils. It is one thing for CDC to have safety guidelines on their website and people walking around not following them. In the meantime businesses have been shut down and Jobs of millions have been lost and the confirmed cases have reached beyond a million and the deaths are still mounting and approaching 75,000 and rising."

But, the downside of his parading our military, not his, was the disrespect he showed to both the late John McCain and the gold star parents will never wash the stench of disdain he has had toward the military, particularly those pesky bone spurs that prevented him from joining the very military he so proudly parades.

No, President Trump, our military is not yours and many of us do not appreciate being used as stage props for the incessant hate rallies.

The reality is the United States is being victimized and held hostage by the most dysfunctional and incompetent president in U.S. history. Trump is a seriously unbalanced narcissist, incapable of empathy, and incapable of putting the national interest and greater common welfare before his own personal interest. The only reason he remains in office is because of Mitch McConnell and his cadre of bootlickers in the U.S. Senate who value their re-election and hold on power more than they do American lives and the integrity of our democracy and institutions. (And this is why we need HR1 to pass and why we need term limits in Congress.) Take Graham for example: a ""never Trumper"" and look how he has twisted his words and actions to grovel at Trump's feet. And consider William Barr, who blatantly auditioned to become a consiglieri for the president– a position Barr views as imperial and immune from basic law – instead of AG for the entire country. Barr has worked doggedly to undermine accountability in government and to bully Trump's opponents and critics. Barr has shattered the integrity of the DOJ. These men didn't cause covid19, but their corruption,their greed, their contempt for science, for truth; their willful ignorance and blind allegiance to Trump:a sociopath, created the environment allowing these crises to explode.

2020-05-07 22:12:20,When the virus has run its course 60-70% percent of us will have been infected no matter policy is adopted. The ONLY reason to adopt ANY transmission related policy is to flatten the curve to a point where hospitals can handle the patient load. There is no point in further flattening the curve. So our policy should not be based on reducing transmission. Our policy should be based on titrating the infection rate against hospital response capacity. Providing greater hospital response capacity should be a focus and getting us to that 60-70% level quickly. You are engaging in magical thinking if you think transmission reduction is the goal.

Bernie supporters did not electTrump. Not directly; not indirectly. You are angry at the wrong people. You should direct your anger at the greed and short-sightedness of the billionaires (in both parties) that control the system that made Trump possible. 

Corporate money, foreign money, the corrupt electoral college, voter suppression, an uninspiring DNC-selected Democratic candidate, Russian interference, Facebook and other social media — these are the factors that led to Trump. 

It’s interesting that Democrats simultaneously blame progressives (and Bernie supporters) for their losses, while at the same time admonishing and relegating them to “persona non grata” status. Which is it? Are progressives such a tiny segment that they don’t matter or are they such a force to be reckoned with that they make or break an election? If the former, then who cares, right? If the latter, then why does the DNC refuse to include progressive voices in their organization? Either welcome progressives into the machinery fold or give it a rest already."

Traces of the COVID-19 coronavirus have been found in the semen of some severely infected men, raising the possibility that the virus might be sexually transmitted, a new study from China claims.
Researchers found evidence of the virus in six men out of a group of 38 COVID-19 patients at Shangqiu Municipal Hospital in China who provided samples.
The six men included four who were still infected and two who were recovering, the researchers said.
The study was led by Dr. Weiguo Zhao of the People's Liberation Army General Hospital in Beijing, and findings were published May 7 in the journal JAMA Network Open.

A resurgence of the virus is likely, even without such foolish human action, as pandemics tend to have waves of outbreak and develop new hotspots over time. 

What will happen to all those small businesses which employ so many if, after re-opening once, they have to shut down again?  Many will not survive, which means many folks will be permanently out of work. I hope this time is different.

The EU and the ECB exist and act in as much as the member states allow them to exist and act.

With a shared currency the international value of which is dragged hither and yon by choices, preferences and decisions motivated by the electoral considerations of the individual governments of the 19-member eurozone, the whole construct may be sitting on a powder keg with a slow burning, but definitely lit fuze.

Tourism, for example, will still happen. It would just be Greeks staying in Greece (and not going to France), or Germans not going to France, and French tourists not going to Germany. 

Also, countries that import the oil they use (i.e., most of the European Union), are not going to send so much money to countries that produce oil.

Similarly, countries that were ""suffering"" with excessive consumerism, would slow down, so less economic activity but less money being sent to manufacturing countries like China. (How many plastic flowers does one need anyway?)

So, in short, countries were ""spending"" money to keep their economy where it was, and now they would not have to ""hemorrhage"" that kind of money.

So, if a country was spending 80 cents to make 100 cents, it will now be short 20 cents, and not 100 cents.

The real question, is how quickly each economy readjusts to a new way of consumer thinking.

Globalization was a huge social experiment that has been failing since at least 2008.

So I went to my private doctor who immediately gave me antibiotics.  (A private doctor, a really, good one, costs far less than a hundred dollars per visit with no insurance there.)  It makes sense, scientifically.  They are worried about diseases becoming antibiotic resistant.

The EU is turning a corner (at least temporarily) while here we are going from bad to worse in most of the country. This may even help the EU, which does a lot of trade with the US, but currently competes with the US for international markets too. 
This article may give the impression that the lock downs in Europe have not been successful, while they actually were. Just look at the US and the UK. Who do you think will recover sooner, the countries who severely restricted movement for a short period and got the virus relatively under control, or the countries who mocked it, delayed all efforts and now have the virus spreading uncontrollably? If you think a 7% contraction of the economy is bad, just wait and see where we are in December. So much for individual freedom, when people are forced to go to work to virus hot spots, and are being denied care for lack of insurance."

2020-05-07 18:16:44,"Honestly, even before this I did not think that the EU will make it to the end of this decade.  The Euro currency is a fiasco.  It benefited Germany, home to global brands like Siemens, BMW, to the detriment of countries like Italy with more regional brands like Fiat.  Basically the Euro has been persistently too weak to properly reflect Germany's economy, boosting its exports and industrial production while Italy was perpetually being strangled by a currency that is too strong for its needs. 

Aside from that the migrant crisis fiasco, which they failed to handle properly.  They tried to impose ME-African colonists on distinct native cultures, which in effect amounts to a crime.

EU efforts to unilaterally save the planet from climate change have been ineffective in terms of actually affecting the global trajectory, but succeded in further undermining its economy.  In the past decade average EU growth was only half that in the US, which itself was not particularly robust.

With this crisis, I think it is really game over for the EU.  By the end of this decade it will no longer exist."

Are you listening, Google, Facebook, etc.?

The present system, the one being crushed by the virus, is weighted in favor of oligarchy, not only in Europe but throughout the world.  It could change and everyone's lives would be better.  The question is whether it will or not."

In 2016, EU Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager ordered Apple to pay back $14.3 billion in taxes to Ireland, saying the company had received “illegal” tax benefits over the course of two decades.  And guess what, the Irish never took it. The ""look"" of the Irish may be about to change if Trump rightly brings home the US Pharmas."

The best advice he ever gave me: “Remember, timing is everything.”  That axiom aptly applies to our current crisis. To a person, we all agree the country must reopen as soon as possible.

Maybe the most expensive military on the planet can do something useful for a change. Maybe Give each general a state to manage, together with the equipment and manpower to make a difference. They  will feel better being on a winning side for a change."

The economic recovery will be slow and painful despite Trump's prediction of a ""boom"" in Q4..

Without a vaccine, the majority of the country will take a measured approach to a return to normalcy.

Our No. 1 trading partner, the European Union is heading for a deep depression.

Let that statement from our President sit with you for a minute.  

This Administration will stop at nothing to continue to gaslight their faithful. The absence of a robust national testing plan by now, months after this pandemic struck, is criminal. 

The playbook for the next six months will be to call out individual States for their response, shifting blame to the local level and never, ever owning as much as an iota of responsibility for the complete abdication of leadership.

The surging numbers of those testing positive in meat-packing plants and nursing homes are clear examples as Trump increasingly pushes to open up the economy though cautioned by members of the White House Coronavirus Advisory Council."
2020-05-07 10:33:29,"All through this Mr. Trump has seemed ignorant of the nature of infectious disease. He assumes that an area with fewer infections will permanently stay low risk. Current trends show that to be faulty thinking as cases rise in previously ""low risk"" spots. 

Mr. Trump now seems to think that if he is tired of the virus it will just ""disappear.""  It is true that flattening the curve means that our healthcare system is better able to handle the very ill patients who arrive in droves. What is an open question is how many Americans will be willing to go to work if those infections threaten them or their loved ones. 

This president's messages, both verbal and behavioral, that we can just move one have many in this country opting to ignore social distancing rules and shun wearing masks. But just because they are done with the virus does not mean that the virus is done with them. Second and third waves of closing down will do more damage than staying closed longer would have done."
2020-05-07 10:42:31,"It says it all that when Trump talks about the lives lost to the virus, he almost always says “death” not “deaths” - as in “There will be more death.” 

For him, the loss of many thousands of fellow Americans is an abstract concept, collateral damage, necessary sacrifice (by others), not the deaths of real individual people. Even when he (very occasionally) mentions those dead and mourning, there is no scintilla of true feeling behind the words he parrots.

And yet, his base stays loyal. It is staggering that his supporters still believe he knows what he is talking about and actually cares about what happens to them."
2020-05-07 10:30:06,"Our economy will be disrupted by either choice, open back up, or stay closed. When opening too soon and allowing the illness to spread leads to high rates of absenteeism, business will be far from usual, and more people die. It's a false choice, cynical and politically motivated. Thankfully, most Govenors seem to be exercising at least a modicum of restraint and common sense."
2020-05-07 10:50:48,"Face it, Trump is shifting gears, to avoid questions about his months of incompetence that have worsened the effects of the virus across the U.S. and like a 6 year old, his attention span is quite short and basically he's bored with those infected and the every increasing deaths. Has anyone witness Trump expressing any sort of compassion or empathy for infected Americans, or has he only been focused on lining his pockets and those of the 1%? Profiteering over American lives, is his motto."

We have been told by all the experts we need a smart systematic approach that includes way more testing and contact tracing etc, and good, thoughtful guidelines.  It's absolutely ridiculous that we are living through this experience where the top leaders don't get that simple fact, and have not done the work including initiating the war powers act to get the factories to make what is needed.  Common sense tells us their approach will fail, due to not absorbing this simple fact.  And the entire country are guinea pigs.  I am thankful that at least my state is trying to be sensible."

After you, Mr. Trump.  

Protected by his frequent Covid-19 testing, and insulated from the ravages of this  ghastly disease,  the presiden has the audacity to urge the American people to sacrifice themselves on the altar of his re-election.

I simply can't imagine any other American president--no matter how bad in the eyes of history--being so blatantly selfish and demanding of the citizens he's supposed to lead.

Moreover he makes the choice binary: states must ""reopen"" before it's safe because they can't stay closed ""for years.""

Nobody is saying ""years"": The American people aren't stupid but who wants to run onto  the battlefield with no weapons, no strategy, no overall plan?"
2020-05-07 10:43:01,"At the beginning of the Trump Administration, while attempting to repeal the Affordable Care Act, the NYT interviewed a Trump Supporter - a woman in the Midwest who was very concerned that without health insurance she would die. She stated that she had not believed he would actually act on attempting to repeal the very legislation that was saving her life. When asked if she regretted her vote as she might lose her life in part because of Trump’s actions, she stated that she absolutely would vote for Trump again if given the chance.

This is what we are up against. A disturbingly high percentage of our population— in 2016 enough to exploit the infirmities of our weak and outdated electoral system — is in thrall to a grifting narcissistic vain insecure failing conman. They are willing to give their lives so he can go about destroying all the good things that we once enjoyed in this country. All of our democratic institutions, all of our ideals. 

We are experiencing a cult on a massive scale never before seen in the history of the world. This is Jonestown writ large. Ordinary people are willing to die for this amoral man who demands everything and gives nothing, who only concerns himself about himself. 

So yes open it up. Open it all up. Dying for the Dear Leader is a badge of honor. For the rest of us who hope to live in a world of kindness, decency, scientific fact and democratic ideals, we’re collateral damage. RIP USA."
2020-05-07 10:57:35,"I am embarrassed and disgusted that he is our President. His number one job is to keep Americans safe and in so doing instill confidence that we will get the R0<1 and give us a good shot at a decent chance of a safe reopening of the economy. He has done nothing but incite conspiracy theories and now a trade war again. With a country that successfully beat back COV-19 while our ship burns with 1.3 million cases! 
His priority is clearly incite his base, harass the doctors and scientists, propagate fake news to that effect and get reelected. We really need a real leader at a time like this."
2020-05-07 10:42:47,"It is clear the administration has decided that any death count, no matter how high, is preferable to staying shut down; blind to the fact that a high death count will keep things shut regardless; dead people don't show up to work.

By reopening too early they will get people killed.  The ugliest part of it is that their own lack of scientific knowledge or understanding leads them to believe it won't affect people like them, that only the poor and old will die.  They will compel people back to work while they and their friends will stay inside and feel protected."

I choose opening our country back up."
2020-05-07 11:00:40,Let us remind ourselves that 1 in 4 deaths worldwide due to Covid19 have occurred in these United States.  We can quibble about under-reporting by some countries but the fact remains that we have had far too many missteps at the highest levels to expect a better outcome.   What the President wants to do now is the equivalent of a Hail Mary pass by giving up on containing the spread of covid19 and hoping the economy rises in time to fuel his re-election.  What is more likely out if this gamble is an infected and jobless America.
2020-05-07 11:17:31,Trump doesn’t understand that we can’t simply ignore the virus and go back to our jobs as before the pandemic.  Just consider the health impact of corona virus on people working in industries that have been deemed essential like meat packing and health care.  I’m not about to visit a crowded restaurant until it is clear we have this virus under control.
2020-05-07 11:23:44,"There are countless sound bites to point to as low points of this administration, however, the one that has continually replayed itself in my mind is when Don J uttered, “America isn’t built for this,” at one of his rambling side shows. 

This phrase more than any hi-lights his lack of understanding of historical American achievements, his “outsider” position on any and every thing and his complete lack of imagination and vision. 

We have spent the first 20 years of this century unwittingly building for this type of thing. The internet is finally being used for its original intended purpose. We are America, Don, we are uniquely positioned to innovate.

The virus and it’s consequences are truly horrible. We’ve had to shelter in place to simply try and give our underprepared medical system and government a window to catch up, and yet this one goof ball of a man wants us to march on down the the USA Bar and Grill and just ignore the fact that our fellow countrymen will unnecessarily die by the thousands and tens of thousands?

America is a country, not a company. And sometimes we have to take those words echoing from the Apollo missions and put them into action here on Earth, we have to be willing to take one giant leap for mankind."

2020-05-07 11:26:29,"I've heard conservatives go on and on, as the President has, about how we can't keep the country shutdown for years and years. My question, then, is simple:

Is there a single recognized health expert advocating for a shutdown lasting years or this -- and pardon the expression -- just another right-wing fever dream?"

We have seen what happens when those charged with responding to extreme challenges fail.  The virus continues. People are dying. Hunger is abroad in the world. And we have leaders that want to profit and do not have the humanity to understand. A cataclysmic disaster. And we cannot get simple supplies, men with attack weapons threaten our state capitals, ..... and there is no leadership. A brutal lesson."

2020-05-07 11:21:25,"“In a way, by doing all this testing we make ourselves look bad,” pretty much sums up his entire attitude and philosophy- appearance, show, perception are more important than content, action, and the value of human life. As stated in this excellent article, Cuomo is the only responsible man of action, a real leader who is really considering that sacred value. Meanwhile, the Republican agenda rolls on, 100 environmental protections rolled back, cuts to food stamps, destruction of the USPS, on and on.

""No idea""; Extraordinary, given how we were, and still are, depending on hearing the truth about this attack on our lives.

I gather he also had no idea that every American trapped at home, watching and listening to Dr. Fauci, Dr. Berx, and other competent members of the task force, were hunkered down engaging in their critical and decidedly most important part of the war on the Coronavirus, such being the nearly absolute acts of social distancing, wearing masks and gloves, and staying away from work, while tolerating his 24/7 attempts to minimize the existential threat facing our nation, his attacks on the press, and his abysmal failure to understand that the threat posed by the Coronavirus was deadly serious.

I would be shocked if there is any American left, who heard him ramble on during the briefings, who did not cringe in embarrassment and shame, at some point during every briefing, in reaction to his repeated outrageous assertions and dangerous recommendations.

“I think he has given up on the hard stuff and as a consequence is writing off people’s lives,” said Andy Slavitt, the acting administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.

The truth is, he never cared about the welfare and wellbeing of anyone's life, other than his own."
2020-05-07 11:07:05,"From the beginning of his presidency, Trump couldn't bother himself with the daily intelligence briefing. He couldn't bother himself with the complexities of health care; or the details of a national infrastructure initiative; or the requirements of the Constitution.  He couldn't bother himself with vetting and nominating qualified people.  He couldn't bother himself learning about other countries, about climate change, or about the world in which we live.  

So it comes as no surprise that now he can't bother himself to lead the long hard slog against this ""invisible enemy.""

Trump prefers visible enemies who are weak and unfortunate.  

And those are the people who are the main victims of this pandemic.  Of course he can't be bothered."
2020-05-07 11:14:28,"For once, I agree with Trump.  As NYT reported yesterday, 1 in 5 children is going hungry.  People need to work!  We are all free to stay home if we fall into a risky category.  We need to be free to work, too.  The fact of the matter is, this primarily kills the elderly/unhealthy.  They need to continue to shelter, the rest of us need to get on with life."
2020-05-07 11:17:11,"To offer some contrast here, every day I also read the WSJ and the commenters there echo the same sentiments as the leader they worship. We will never have a unified effort against this, and as with everything else, it has become a partisan bickering match. Medical breakthroughs, and a Trump defeat in November, are the only things to focus on at this point. Everything else is white noise."
2020-05-07 11:17:32,"The pandemic is far from over.  It is just beginning.  We are now learning that the primary vector for spread was New York City and that the disease has been circulating for far longer than we initially realized.  The geneticists have been able to determine that the virus has been spreading since late last year.

That means seeds of the disease have been planted all over the nation.  It also appears that it can take months for it to breakout once an area has been seeded.  And that means that we will continue to see hot spots flare up in the coming months.  And that means that we cannot travel between communities because such travel would restart new outbreaks.

The only way we can get a handle on this is widespread and frequent testing.  We have no national plan to implement such a strategy.  There is no national leadership.  It's all been delegated to the states.  Consequently, the virus has become the new normal until we have a way to defeat it."
2020-05-07 11:39:05,"Any president in this situation would be making the same hard calculation. What’s a human life worth? We can’t close the country down for one person, although nobody wants to be that one person. We don’t close the country for seasonal flu - that has taken more lives in a year than Covid19 has.

Conferences, concerts, churches, cruises, and Mardi Gras were all huge culprits in the spread of this virus all over the country. I hope we will learn for the future that these should be immediately halted at the first sign of an outbreak. 

Looking at the unemployment numbers it also seems like a good plan for every citizen to be assigned a civil service skill that they train for in high school or during the summers and work a handful of hours every year as reservist that they switch to in times of crisis. The areas could be: medical, food production/distribution, wartime production of crucial items the country needs, communications, delivery & construction. It would be similar to the army reserves. The benefits would be two-fold: a person would be able to switch to his/her essential civil job during a crisis to aid the country in its time of need and still make an income, a person could switch to their civil job if they lose their normal job unexpectedly. 

We will probably have many regrets about the way this situation evolved, but the positive side is that it has exposed a major weakness that can be mitigated with better planning and preparedness and it has also very quickly revealed the difference between what we want and what we really need."

There’s a fate worse than COVID death. I am concerned for the health and well-being of my family but I am even more fearful of the political fallout. Global food shortages are already happening. Children in the USA aren’t getting enough to eat because their parents have been forbidden to work and provide for them.

Trump is both a disgrace to his office and a disgraceful human being. Not a shred of empathy or compassion for anyone but himself.
The entire country has been ransomed off by his administrations bumbling chaotic response and in a awful game of Russian roulette he's drawn the short straw for the country and now people you know, people you knew, both unknown and famous are dropping like flies around the country and the best he can do is to encourage the macabre spectacle of people going back out to mingle and work.

Now, a plague sets in and slows our destructive habits. It is a terrible reckoning of sickness, death and great stress. And, it is a chance to look at who we are, what we do and how we must change. Yes, the virus has re-set the stage.

We see how clear the skies have become. We see how the rich are still having really good lives while the workers are now in poverty and behind in bills, wondering if rent or mortgage payments will be made. This is today. Today is scary and clear. Clear to what we've done to common humanity's bonds and human's duty to nature.

We can do better; this is our chance to rebuild from the bottom. No, great wealth concentration is not good for democracy. No, ruining the earth is not what we want to do and to leave for our children. No, we must stop the current madness.

So, love and hope and care and be a good citizen. Discuss all the issues and help a neighbor. Call-out the lying, con-man, traitorous President. And, get ready for November's elections.

And oh yes, Ms. McEnany the general and his Aide-de-camp, Jared Kushner, have not yet provided the troops here with the much needed supplies to win this battle despite their assertions to the contrary.

The Press Secretary claiming that Trump's handling of our response to this saved lives is dangerously delusional.  In other words, she is a perfect for for Trump.  Trump/Pence never understood the science behind mitigation.  They think they ""attacked"" the virus and it has abated.  Be clear:   NOTHING has been done to the virus.  We don't yet know what to do.

It appears that someone does not subscribe to the only way that an infectious disease, one with no known therapeutic treatment and no preventative vaccine, can be controlled. Testing alone allows a society to identify, track and then isolate in a targeted way. Broad testing programs that provide vital information that allow us to understand and make rational decisions. Strangely enough, leaders in other countries have followed the advice of their medical and public health scientists and have successfully demonstrated how important testing programs are in our battle against this virus. Some leaders understand that the primary effect of this pandemic is a public health crisis while the secondary effect is an economic crisis. The “war” can not be won by attacking the secondary without having defeated the primary adversary."

The consequences of their policies and ideologies over the last 4 decades to eviscerate national government, disproportionately lower taxes on the wealthy, and further disenfranchise poor and minority Americans has led us to this place. From the perspective of the demographic changes that the Republicans are so afraid of, they could hardly dream of a better plan for their future: let the virus kill the poor, kill minorities, kill Democrats at higher rates than average. The sooner they open up for business, without testing and tracking in place, the more of their opposition they kill. The Chinese Communist Party no doubt looks upon our Republican Party with envy at its effectiveness."

All that matters is how something ‘plays’.  There have always been such people and always will be.

Then it was a joke.  Now, it's no longer funny because it's real.  He's actively willing to let people in NY, NJ, MI, IL, CA, WA, OR, and VA die because...the governors don't kiss up.  He wants people to go back to work in horribly unsafe conditions because the economy makes him look bad and he wants his hamberders (sic). 

""Essential Businesses"" are--big Republican donors and Trump supporters.  

He wants to starve Social Security, cut food stamps even as we learn that nearly 1/5th of American kids are not getting sufficient food while farmers are plowing under crops, killing meat animals, and pouring milk on the ground.

Let's play a little game...because, hey, what else to do to fill the time as we wait for the other shoe to drop? 


Despite Warnings of Growing Death Toll, JFK Is Ready to Move On


Despite Warnings of Growing Death Toll, Nixon Is Ready to Move On


Despite Warnings of Growing Death Toll, Bush Is Ready to Move On


Despite Warnings of Growing Death Toll, Carter Is Ready to Move On


Despite Warnings of Growing Death Toll, Obama Is Ready to Move On

In order to gauge where we are, just cast an eye back. Imagine the hue and cry if ANY other president in US history had taken such a glib, cavalier, inhuman approach to the deaths of the very people he's charged with protecting. 

It's unimaginable. And that is where we are. Unimaginable suffering. Unimaginable losses. Unimaginable financial carnage. 

And all because the man ""in charge"" is in charge of nothing more or less than his own ego. The word ""tragedy"" is too small and tidy a word to address what we're facing. 

Rome is burning and the narcissist on the wall doesn't even know how to fiddle."

""I have heard we have tremendous supply"" he said with his compulsively lying tongue. He disbanded Obama's Pandemic Office. He failed to maintain ventilators. He is shameless in his obvious misrepresentations. He has not done anywhere near enough testing. He does not want to face the horrendous numbers. This from the down to almost zero President. He is ordering meat works to open without providing safe workplaces. The hypocrisy, negligence and recklessness are mind boggling. Trump and Pence get tested repeatedly as do those that come anywhere near them.
""Tremendous supply""? Community based hospitals have terrible supply issues. Other hospitals have sporadic supplies. If not why would nurses have to use the same masks for weeks on end?
How anyone can still defend him is a mystery for the ages."
2020-05-07 11:53:09,"Trump and his lackeys are proceeding in a calculated way to thin the ranks of likely opposition voters.  An example.  They label meat-packing plants vital businesses, are trying to pass legislation to protect companies from lawsuits, punish workers who defy back-to-work orders because of lack of safety by denying them unemployment benefits, so it’s either do without food, shelter, health care, etc. or be exposed to Covid.  This is blackmail.  Apparently, regard for life is limited to the unborn.  Trump continues to dismantle or eviscerate every part of the government that protects citizens against unfettered power—environmental, political, fiscal, judicial—all the while naming cronies or political backers to important positions.  The House no longer controls the purse-strings or has the sole power to declare war, investigate wrongdoing in the Executive, etc.   Trump is aided and abetted by McConnell, Barr, the Supreme Court majority, GOP Senators who have forgotten their solemn oath to defend and protect the Constitution, “protesters” carrying military weapons to intimidate those exercising their right to,peaceful protest.  This is America?"
2020-05-07 11:59:27,"President Trump is, and has always been, motivated by money and power, two things this virus threatens. What he and other people who make the false distinction between the economy OR people's health is that once everything opens up and lots more people get sick or die, the economy will tank even more, as history has shown in previous pandemics.

But I think there's another reason Mr. Trump wants to move on now: he's bored with the virus. Mr. Trump is famous for his minimal attention span. He's just tired of this program and wants to change the channel."

He’s still doing it. We know the elderly are the most vulnerable, so it doesn’t make sense. This isn’t an oversight, it was done on purpose to drive death toll up. Rumors of Covid 19 vaccination ID’s to be required, yet nursing homes can’t  legally ask if new patients have it!  No voter ID cards but need vaccination cards?  Had one of my family members died here, I would have already held Cuomo accountable. Over 4,000 NYC deaths have come from nursing homes."

We’ve been invaded by a virus. It might not be as beneficial for the military industrial complex right now, but the military can do much more to help state and local governments. Remember when the army was sent to the border to stop the Trump migrant caravan mirage of late 2018?

Military commanders keep on talking about maintaining “readiness” when the enemy is already here! Are we really worried about Iran bombing some obscure base in Iraq right now? Do they really think China is going to launch an offensive when their own country is jumping from lockdown to lockdown? With the exception of Desert Storm, we have gotten drubbed in every military engagement since WW2. I think I understand why."

I thought about  it, but that's where you get the 2-1/2 million people.""  This is what he wanted to do from the beginning.  It's the only explanation for the way he dragged his feet so obviously at the beginning of this.  No one could have failed as miserably as he has unless they were trying to fail.

But the right way to open up is to do it cautiously and gradually, looking at data and science to make decisions, and with sufficient testing and contact tracing to monitor results and quickly react. Trump though is doing what he has relied on in the past. Despite his administration’s disastrous response, he is claiming victory and ignoring reality, believing that his hype will convince enough people that he’s right and that he will win re-election. He doesn’t care about people dying, especially because they’re disproportionately poor and have dark skin. He only cares about himself. Unfortunately even if he’s voted out of office we have him as president until January. The deaths of thousands of Americans will be on his hands."

2020-05-07 12:01:12,"With Trump, there is only one statistic that matters; his poll numbers.  In all his past endeavors he has shown no concern with the human toll resulting from his actions.  His bankruptcies, refusals to pay, failed projects, his university all harmed many innocent people. His strategy that shifts daily is based on how it polls, or as he says ‘after hearing from some very respected people’ instead of what is happening to the nation. The big question is how he will rewrite the narrative to downplay a world-leading death and infection rate. One thing is certain, it will cast Trump as the hero, Obama, Hillary, the Chinese as the villains and Trump as the victim."

The rich will fly on their own planes or private plane companies that have gotten help in the recent governmental funding, and will be in safer places with others endangering themselves.  In contrast, the poor need to get back to work understanding that in some states, Medicaid is being cut, so they will need to pay more medical expenses as well as rent, food costs, transportation.  The thought is clear.  We don't need all these people.  No sense trying to help them survive.  If they can't do it on their own, too bad.  If children are hungry, their parents will find ways to feed them or they will die.  Sad, isn't it, that this is the Great America.  I really preferred how FDR tried to handle unemployment and disaster.  Of course, during the depression people didn't have to social distance to increase chances of escaping a deadly disease, but they did have a federal government interested in helping them survive.  In the Great America, we know better, because we know some people shouldn't exist anyhow, so why should we help them survive."

There is a way through this crisis, but only if all human lives and livelihoods  are given equal weight in the calculus to the ""economics.""

2020-05-07 11:40:30,"A non-partisan assessment:

We know little about how this virus will behave.  Projections of what will happen with staged re-openings are questionable. We don't know the ideal balance between reducing morbidity and maximizing economic activity. The only way to find it is to allow some states to re-open according to approved guidelines.

There is key information the public is not provided.  Without this information our opinions are worthless compared to those whom we assume have this information.  For example, the number of cases and deaths is of limited use.  Number of cases depends on the number of tests and deaths lag weeks behind the current transmission status. We need to know hospital admissions and ICU admissions, perferably per 1000 tested.

We also don't know the real health cost of quarantine. Has there really been an increase in suicide or domestic violence?  What is the projected morbidity of delayed doctors' visits, ER visits, and immunizations?

The details of how it is done are debatable but there is no doubt the economy needs to re-open. Printing a trillion dollars a week can't last. Social distancing and point-contact tracing with quarantine flattened the curve and prevented death. However, missed in the discussion is our health care system is remarkably flexible and our mortality rate is a third most Western Countries. We are able to provide ventilators and ICUs when needed.

Conclusion: we gotta open, it may be bad but our health care system can handle it."

Let that sink in. His only concern is appearances -- we don't want to look bad -- and that's part of his reasoning for opening things up again. Open businesses=economic success. Not necessarily since the survey also mentioned in the article says Americans by a 2 to 1 margin think it's too soon to open since they are worried about their health. If only the occupant of the White House was concerned about their health; he's only concerned in how he looks."
2020-05-07 11:50:03,"As bad as the virus may be, the cost of the virtual national lockdown has grown too high.

The cost that is too high is Trump's reelection prospects.  Many of us are more than willing to cool things for a few months more, but Trump has decided it's OK to sacrifice some of us if it means he might get a second term.  After all, as argued during impeachment, no cost is too high if one believes their reelection is the most important national security issue."

The virus has not gone away. In many States the curve is going up----before the restrictions are lifted.

This is a BIG gamble, both for Trump and the U.S."

I put 'experts' in quotes because this is a practical political judgment, one that cannot be made by any particular expert in business, economics, epidemiology, or medicine. 

We already go about our lives as tens of thousands die annually from influenza. while we produce a vaccine that some years only helps maybe half the inoculated.

How about some hard numbers, so that we can all know precisely the criteria governing a reopening? The knock against GWB (fairly) was that he mired us in a war with no clear objectives or goals that would signal victory. What exact numbers will signal the end of quarantine?"

We all know secound hand smoking killed millions of people who never smoke an still does today. All legit an most cases has zero regulation on how it is grown an processed because not food. Our streets continue to have serous problems homeless an illegal drugs ruining countless lives costing trillions health care cost. Guess thats all has purpose if we dont have probelms health problems dont need doctors . Why we have lots government so we can regulate tabbaco.This is mentality stopping us from all going back to work an feed our familys.
2020-05-07 12:12:49,"Clueless to the very end, Trump had no idea that the US population was counting on the advice and leadership of the coronavirus task force. I guess he thought that we were all sitting in our homes waiting for him to dispense his latest pearls of wisdom. That of course assumes that anyone understands his rambling and chaotic way of speaking.

Luckily the people of the US are not as dim witted as their acceptance of his pathetic presidency would indicate. They will decide when it is safe to return to normal life despite Trump's constant stream of lies. He did not shut down the country, our governors did and he will not be the one to open it again, the people will.

As always he see this pandemic only through the lens of how it might affect him. He has virtually no regard for the American public, not even for the people who constitute his base. I guess he thinks that his lies and deceptions will conquer this virus in the same way that he has conquered the Republican Party."
2020-05-07 10:55:25,"This conversation would be much more informative if the author (and the media generally) projected out what our country might look like after two, six, twelve months of forced economic shutdown as a fair basis of comparison?  

How many business fail?  

How many cultural and educational institutions close their doors forever?  

What unemployment (and tax revenue) might look like in such a scenario.  

Basic forward looking analysis comparable to the projected deaths and infections that have been at the core of all reporting on the virus.  

There is no question, this is an unprecedented situation and no choice is without consequences.  

But we would't allow motorcycles on the road if the standard was that no one died or got hurt,  

I'd like perspective from the media, not alarmist advocacy which is what most media is today."

It’s up to the people now.  To show him!  Like a human poll, our behavior - to protect ourselves and care about others - will indicate what really matters to the huge majority of Americans.

It’s going to backfire on Trump.  Because the people who party and gather in groups will be “HIS” people.  Rural people, whose hospitals have closed.  Who will infect each other - while standing around all geared up with machine guns.  Guns which will never protect them from the real enemy.  The virus.

And as those people become sick, with no hospitals and doctors within firing distance.  And die off.  His strategy to “open up” will end up killing off the very voters he’s counting on to re-elect him.

Trump has created a Sophie's Choice of health vs. money, Blue vs Red, public health vs. individual freedoms.  And to add to that toxic mixture, let's not forget the militias with assault rifles and neo-Nazi signs.  Does he think this is a reality show about mobilizing his base?

Australia, New Zealand, South Korea and other countries have achieved remarkable success in nearly eliminating this scourge.  They can afford to restart their economies without much fear of subsequent epidemic waves which will again result in draconian measures.

2020-05-07 12:28:11,"What trump stunningly doesn’t realize is that if infections and deaths resurge, people will self-quarantine, regardless of what trump or any local official wants.  That leaves the economy actually in worse shape.  Why? ... Because there is no cogent strategy and people will lose the confidence needed to restart their lives. It will take much longer to restore. 

Yes, the cure is quite painful, but if done strategically, there is a path back to normal.  Otherwise, it’s continued cycles of chaos and misery."

By not giving money to people who need to stay home to stay well, they're forcing the opening of business and no matter how many people died, that is just an acceptable number. Why aren't people fighting back? Why aren't people refusing to go? it's because Americans don't realize they have any power in the situation. Our Congress people should have already provided sufficient resources for people to stay safe, but the Democrats just follow the Republicans, and Mitch McConnell sent everybody home. The federal government does not care anymore about anything except business and the financial health of their donors, and party doesn't matter."
2020-05-07 12:19:20,"Trump calls himself a wartime president and it's evident by his behaviour. He's handling this crisis just like he handled the Vietnam war, by running away from his responsibility and letting others do it for him. I'm not saying that he had to go to Viet Nam, but he didn't protest the war either. He just went out and made money. Nothing has changed. It's business as usual."
2020-05-07 12:22:21,"A national shut down of businesses for more than a week was the biggest blunder for the economy and for the deaths due to COVID-19. Now we know that there are going to be close to 75,000 US deaths due to COVID-19, majority of those are in the coastal areas of the USA which are the major entry points for International travelers from the far east Asia, primarily China and from Europe. 

Trump restricted travel as promptly as he could but still that could have been even much earlier. Anyone who thinks that we could have had fewer total deaths if businesses were not shut down have nothing to compare with other than the success of Swedish model. The Swedes always took precautions. They restricted travel from countries outside their borders. They quarantined Swedes returning from overseas. They provided adequate medical support to confirmed +ve cases. They asked their seniors above 60, which form a significant proportion of their population to stay out of the line of fire of COVID-19. They followed common sense safety precautions like ""safe distancing"", hygienic practices of wearing masks, washing hands and wiping surfaces while eating a balanced diet with optimal protein, minerals and vitamin intake. 

Sweden's fatality rate due to COVID-19 among 60+ is no different from that of the fatality rate among the same age group in the USA, Italy, China, Iran, Spain. Most significantly, if by the end of May, Sweden does acquire ""Herd immunity"" without a vaccine that will be phenomenal."
2020-05-07 12:25:06,"Take the time to consider Trump's statement that more testing makes us look bad. No, more testing helps understand the reality we are living with. But facts and truth are very inconvenient to that poor excuse for a human being.

We must test extensively for a myriad of reasons but Trump abhors science. Suppose we find that 20 million people have had the virus but survived without ill effects and that it is proved that plasma donations from from these people to be a crucial tool in this fight to contain the virus. Even if 5% of those people donated plasma to the most vulnerable among us that could save thousands of lives."

It's too risky. I'll take the medical experts' advice to Trump's any day. I love being retired.

Why do we still have inadequate testing and contact tracing?"
2020-05-07 12:36:57,"Declaring the economy open doesn't mean it will open again.

Anything related to travel and tourism is dead.  No international visitors will be coming to the US and no one will let any Americans in without a two week quarantine.

Telling anyone 60+ to be careful and not go out in public means that a significant portion of the customer base is removed from things like restaurants and other public events.

Those who can afford it will stay home indefinitely and curtail their spending until they feel safe.

We shut down the economy for six weeks to ensure our healthcare system was not over whelmed, learn about this new virus, and learn how to deal with it the virus.  Time is up.  Now we need to apply what we have learned about the virus and restart the economy so that people can get back to work and earn a living."

2020-05-07 12:46:46,"We are a divided, unruly country that arguably has not had a unifying national event since WWII.  In fact we have been going in the opposite direction -- abrasive disunity -- since at least the Vietnam War.

At this point, it appears beyond our national capability to unite behind scientists and medical professionals and their educated predictions.  Even here on Long Island, in the NY metropolitan area, where thousands are still succumbing to the virus and dying, local Walmart plazas are teeming with cars and people.

It looks like something close to a full-blown pandemic sweeping largely uncontrolled across the country is something we are destined to go through."

I was confident that someone who had devoted their life to public service, was well educated and had held positions of trust would be prepared for the toughest job on earth. I didn't consider a reality TV actor would be able to measure up. I don't regret my choice, but I wonder how Trump voters feel about theirs today?"

But he was too arrogant, ignorant, and incompetent to do so. We will not forget this utter failure to keep the most basic tenets of his oath of office.

Yesterday, important news occurred, and of course you refused to print it. NY Gov. Cuomo went on record explaining the data gathered by 115 in NY indicate that 66% of the people who contacted COVID-19 said prior to getting sick they had been staying at home. These people were mostly unemployed and were following stay at home recommendations. Guess what that means? Lockdown and staying at home did NOT stop people from getting infected.

And that's about the best research you're going to find because nobody can go back and change conditions and make comparisons with the past. You could also look to Sweden for comparisons, where there was no great lockdown stay-at-home close-all-businesses and schools kind of approach. But US officials and the news media will never admit we made a mistake in the USA.

In fact, it's just continuing onward that an abundance of caution has turned into an abundance of foolishness. We rely on faulty test kits (only 66% accurate), assume cloth masks prevent the illness (only n95 masks have proven effective), report death rates that are highly questionable given they include co-morbid conditions like heart attacks and cancer, etc. 

But I'm all for social distancing. I practiced it every flu season when it's estimated every year up to 65,000 people die from influenza in the USA and nobody bats an eyelash about it, no lockdowns and loss or jobs occur becasue of it, no financial ruin, no media induced panic."

And when the minority gets sick in droves, it will be another poll - of the uneducated and easily conned.  Sadly.

Stay home!  Be part of the real life poll, the popular poll in favor of “living.”"
2020-05-07 12:51:07,"Greed.
It’s a pretty stark choice, this how much money is your life truly worth?
Envy.
A lure for your ego, drawing you out into a field of poor choices and the most dire of consequences, the loss of your conscious experience as a human being, on this planet. Such a thought tamps down the entitlement, no?
Lust.
Not a good time to be swiping left or right or whatever direction you choose for yourself.  Copulation is a blast. No doubt. But, is this a good time to be out there?  Better time to make birth control free.  Not a good time to sire broods that can field an entire baseball team.  Maybe it’s a better moment to contemplate what intimacy really is.  
Sloth.
Human beings are so lazy that even staying home for the benefit of your neighbor’s health seems too hard. You can’t control, but you can do. Don’t confuse fun with happiness. Ponder that one, my siblings.
Pride.
I guess we can all see, by the example in the White House, what grandiosity gets us. Enough said.
Gluttony.
Human beings will put all kinds of things in their mouths. It’s gross.  If you can, build a garden.  If you can, grow more than you need and share with your neighbors who have a shady, or arid plot.  Do this globally. More lions and mountain gorillas. Less cows and pigs, maybe?  I don’t know. Maybe it’s no longer up for us to decide.
Wrath.
Gratitude dissolves anxiety.  Humanity, from time to time, learns to be grateful for small things, in events such as this.  Anger is toxic.  Compassion is an antidote."
2020-05-07 13:03:16,"trump passed his 10 minute ability to focus on a subject around Feb. 1st.  It's been utter madness since.
But today I see donalds hit on a new motivator.  Remove health insurance protection, ACA, from millions of Americans with pre existing health issues.  
Lose the ACA and open Americans up to less than worthless Trumpcare or some religious health insurance tied scam.
Are Americans tired of winning yet?"
2020-05-07 13:15:49,"Number of deaths is the new currency, apparently.  Until we break."
2020-05-07 12:30:10,"Relatively speaking, I'm not so sure that the ""war has gone badly"" as you start off in your article when the USA is comapred to top European countries like Spain, Italy, UK and France all of who have more than double the USA deaths per one million in population than the USA number of 226 per million in population. Of course Germany did splendid with only 87 deaths per one million. However, if it were not for very bad decisions made by NY Governor Cuomo and NYC Mayor de Blasio, which they did all on their own, the US numbers would look a lot better in comparison to countries more like the US in structure when it comes to deaths per million so far. Of course these numbers can only go up so only time will tell.  One can draw their own conclusions by look at this chart which is reliable and updated each day.

2020-05-07 13:14:39,"Well, Germany is opening up. But Germany has a scientifically inclined head of state, with a health-care mechanism in place, who believes scientific data and puts the health of people ahead of narcissistic self-dealing. 

And Germany has a better educated population who accept scientific data and don't bring out their guns and Rebel flags to protest health measures. Or spit at police officers who try to break up large gatherings.    

That's why Germany can reopen, and we might prove to be the sickest country on earth."
2020-05-07 12:37:51,"Clearly Trump is correct and is supported by the vast majority of mainstream Americans. While our lockdown elites are seemingly comfortable with us closing down the economy indefinitely, our country is on the brink of collapse and there’s every chance we’ll never get back to normal unless we reopen immediately. It’s becoming quite clear that there will be significantly more deaths resulting from the shutdown than the actual virus. It’s just a shame our taxpayer funded lefties can’t see this!"
2020-05-07 13:03:51,"So America has come to this sad state: it’s President, and many of his followers, are prepared to sacrifice the lives of what they believe will be mostly minorities, the poor, and elderly in order to keep the wheels of commerce, which primarily enriches the wealthy few, churning. This has to be the saddest chapter in the nations history since its beginning, when human beings were enslaved, tortured, and forced to toil, again, building great wealth mostly for the few. There is no debate that the nations economy cannot, and should not, remain shuttered.  The botched response from a President in denial necessitated the closures.  However, the costs are indeed too high, as are those of an unchecked deadly pandemic. But a humane society, dare I suggest one where the teachings of Christ were really being followed, would focus first on ensuring the maximum safety for all of those workers on the front lines, now deemed essential, from health care to meat packers to grocers, whose sacrifices make it possible for millions of others to work from home or stay home.  And it would ask the richest amongst us, especially the very few whose billions dwarf the resources of all the rest combined, to pay more to support those who depend on income from venues that cannot be operated safely until there are vaccines. That would truly make America great."
2020-05-07 12:44:15,"As Pompeo said of China, so Americans should remember about the Trump administration:

""They had a choice."""
2020-05-07 12:47:12,"""By doing all this testing we look bad"".  How can Trump say this with a straight face.  By not doing all this testing, he looks bad, and worse than that, it shows his blatant disregard for the physical health of our people.  In a just world, his words would be seen as criminal."
2020-05-07 12:47:16,"Well, the crisis already has taxed the attention span of Trump and he has declared victory so he can move on with his toxic agenda.
Ya had to know it was time to declare victory when he mentioned disbanding his task farce."
2020-05-07 12:47:50,"Trump: “In a way, by doing all this testing we make ourselves look bad”. Why doesn't this writer explicitly state WHY deaths are mounting - Trump admin's utter failure to deliver PPE to healthcare workers, widespread testing and contact tracing??? Every viralogist states testing is woefully inadequate. When media fails to state this fact over and over, and hold Trump accountable, it is complicit in his propaganda. So here we are - “I think he has given up on the hard stuff and as a consequence is writing off people’s lives,” said Andy Slavitt."
2020-05-07 13:01:36,"“The president’s cure-can’t-be-worse-than-the-disease logic is clear: As bad as the virus may be, the cost of the virtual national lockdown has grown too high.”

Yes, too high for his chances at being re-elected. Since that is truly all he cares about."
2020-05-07 13:01:57,"The Trump argument that he’s done a great job in dealing with the COVID-19 crisis based on the fact that fewer Americans have died than statistical models predicted (particularly the one from UK of 2.2 million) reminds me of salesmanship strategy used in dealing with naive buyers ... the old “sticker price” ploy. “Do I have a deal for you.” A con man through and through Trump is! And without imagination, who does not and cannot envisage the full meaning of “economy.” This is shown in the reckless drive to go back, but not forward (which is where America will find greatness if it is to be experienced, God willing). The question facing the American people, including for the November election, is whether money is more important than life. And “life” here, everyone’s rather than just the one going with zero-sum game, ie, one’s own. If Trump is America’s leader, the concern is where America is being led and at what price."
2020-05-07 13:04:03,Of course Trump is ready to move on - he has the attention span of a toddler (and apologies to many toddlers).
2020-05-07 13:13:29,"Trump's logic is anything but logical, let alone clear.  If he were interested in rescuing the economy, he'd advocate paying people to stay home.  Instead, he has supported enormous welfare payments to his wealthiest cronies (including tax breaks for his own business!), wants to allow companies to expose their employees to Covid without fear of consequences, and seeks to force people back to work before it's safe.

Reopening the economy before it is safe will lead to mass death.  But it won't actually get the economy moving.  No one is going to spend money when doing so might kill them or when they need to save for the highly likely possibility that they, or a loved one, will be laid off or get sick."
2020-05-07 12:58:02,The only thing that matters to Trump is his re-election chances. That's it.
2020-05-07 12:32:09,"This is most disturbing. Trump is setting up conditions for dystopia. 
The country should be reopened, but only with widespread testing, contact tracing, sufficient PPE for all workers, especially health workers, and a working vaccine. 
In the meantime, the government needs to fully provide for all working people, ALL working people of ALL skin colors and occupations, until reopening can be done properly.
 We have enough money to do all of this, but it’s concentrated in the hands of a few greedy capitalists. 
Wealthy people have become wealthy on the backs of workers. Time to truly take care of those workers.
 What politicians, who prop up and partake in this greedfest, don’t realize is this pandemic lays bare the greedy, racist, amoral and inequitable policies of this failed state. 
They are not going to be able to control this situation forever. Eventually it will start to affect the wealthy in ways that are unimaginable to them."
2020-05-07 12:34:31,What recent war has the US not declared victory and went home?
2020-05-07 13:03:41,"Yes this is worse than Pearl Harbor and 911, but it did not have to be. It should not have been so. Now they are literally running a campaign of deception aimed at luring  the working class into a deadly false sense of security.

Yes people are in desperate financial straits. Knowing that, there is no reason our government can not use our money to insure our survival. Instead of giving it away to those in need of nothing use it to support those who minus a job have nothing until it is once again safe to work without putting ones life at risk.

Choosing a sure path of long term suffering and mass death over short term suffering and a contained virus is imo a no brainer. Money and political survival should never trump the value of human life. 

In a nutshell as clearly displayed over the last three years, and especially the last four months we have no credible leadership in the executive branch. Trump and the GOP are willing to kill Americans for their political benefit. How sick is that?"
2020-05-07 13:10:05,"In broad daylight and in his own words this is a crime against humanity. History will remember him, as he so desires. I trust most Americans will keep themselves and all those near them safe. The economy is not worth yours or your loved ones lives."
2020-05-07 12:40:35,"Trump got five deferments from serving in the Vietnam War-he would not serve his country when he could be a civilian and make lots of money.Now he has been voted leader of a country which by bad fortune is fighting a war against a devastating virus which has set off a worldwide pandemic.Again, he is opting out of the fight-he only wants a roaring economy.To that end he is willing to sacrifice thousands of lives of people who are warriors.With wise planning it would be possible to open the economy and protect  these warriors!Trump has no intention to lead the battle-he simply wants the stock market to excel."
2020-05-07 12:52:40,"It's also important to remember the numerous times the president fabricated lies to assure us that everything was just fine.  Few sources have held him accountable for these fabrications, which wasted time and cost lives."
2020-05-07 13:11:16,"Had an interesting conversation with someone in the family last night. he and his good friend think Trump not only has no empathy for the victims of the pandemic it's very likely he sees it as an advantage to an economic recovery and re-election. Most of the victims who die are elderly and/or minority, neither of whom Trump cares about in the least, are often financial drains that depend on the government for Medicare and Medicaid and are frequently in his mind non-productive or minimally so. Interesting theory and it fits Trump's philosophy of governing: incredibly dumb but worst of all cruel and ruthless. To his credit, Trump did not start a war. Instead he let the pandemic do the work for him. He has become the dangerous man lots of people predicted he would become."
2020-05-07 13:13:23,"This is one of the consequences of having a president with a short attention span.  He cannot think or plan ahead, in part because his policies (to the extent he has them) are purely reactive.  He also has no empathy.  He does not see the thousands of deaths from this horrible disease as a problem for anyone but himself.

The tragedy of our country is that so many of the population here shares his inability to see ahead, to delay gratification, or to see anything through any eyes but their own.  That's how he got elected.  A platform of disruption only gets you so far.  Once everything has been disrupted, what next?"
2020-05-07 12:51:30,"Hey folks, save your eloquence for your Congress Rep. and Senators. Lay out your argument and give them a call -- daily. Let them know what kind of job you believe our President is doing. Your words are nice to read here, but the time for venting and inaction is over."
2020-05-07 12:56:33,"Trump never was concerned about public health. And his only concern about the economy was how it affects his chances of re-election. Before I'm willing to die a gladiator's death in his arena, I'd like to see our fearless unmasked Caesar visit a few meat plants, prisons and nursing homes to congratulate those he calls ""warriors."""
2020-05-07 12:56:38,"Trump is willing to spend hundreds of thousands of American lives to get an early economic recovery before the election.  What he is not willing to do is lead by example.

Trump is not willing to step out from behind his security screen and expose himself to possible infection the way he expects everyone else to expose themselves.  

Trump should stop having every single person he interacts with tested.  He should meet and interact with random, untested people.  And he should do it without a mask, just as he is asking us to do.

And this should not just go for Trump.  It should go for all of the plutocrats funding re-open demonstrations.  If the Mercers or the DeVoses want to fund public demonstrations were hoards of people ignore social distancing, then let them also attend these rallies and rub shoulders with their minions.  

Death by suffocation to save the economy should not just be for little people; it should also for the patricians demanding death sacrifices for their economy."
2020-05-07 13:04:05,"“They’ve gotten our country through this,” she said. “There were supposed to be 2.2 million deaths, and we’re at a point where we’re far lower than that thanks to the great work of the task force and the leadership of President Trump.”

Unbelievable comment by the latest WH press secretary.

The number of deaths and new cases continue to grow, and yet these irresponsible and delusional knuckleheads are parading around and patting themselves on the back telling folks that their mission is complete and it was a great success.

Not sure where it was stated that ""2.2 million deaths"" were going to be a certainty.  And what of the 72,000 deaths?  That number is ""acceptable"" by this administration.

I guess as long as the death rate does not reach 2.2 million, then all is good and right and swell in the White House.

Nice going for discounting those 72,000 deaths as ""non-essential"" since that number doesn't seem to impact nor register with this administration.

WOW on steroids."
2020-05-07 12:31:29,"Trump acts tough because he is weak.  His policies are based on whim and political breezes.  In truth, he has no idea what to do, but he is scared.   His sole purpose is re-election.  His policy is to give us whatever we want.  After all, the US Treasury is at his disposal.  He'll throw more money out the door and so buy the election with our own tax dollars.  To ease the suffering he'll offer scapegoats and applaud when we dress up in army gear and tote AR-15s.  He is predictable."
2020-05-07 13:06:59,"If we know we can do something to stop virus spreading and we don't do it, that is deliberately devalue human lives.  Just because they are older and not contribute to society any more, do they deserve to die prematurely?

We open business now for the economic revival.  For the elders, it is like a situation of survival of the fittest in a primitive society.  They are most vulnerable.  We are a democratic society.  It is not that we don't have choices."
2020-05-07 12:37:29,"Easy (and morally lacking) for Trump, many governors, and other such ilk who are white, mostly male, well off to varying degrees compared with the average citizen, and who themselves won't be out there at risk for infection to make others go out and die.  Especially when it was their inaction in the first place that made the epidemic in this country so severe.  And as always also likely another short sighted approach that in the end is against their self interest.  Do they really think the economy will hum along if what happened in NYC plays out elsewhere?  South Korea, Germany, and some other countries should have been and should still be our role models for this.  Sad that we used to be the role model for the world."
2020-05-07 12:37:33,"""We have to be warriors,"" he said.

When his experience at being a ""warrior"" is to get a diagnosis of bone spurs to avoid the fight."
2020-05-07 12:40:53,"We can blame Trump all we want but from the behavior that we are witnessing every day, we are all either part of the solution or part of the problem. When we tolerate politicizing wearing a mask or when we feel empowered to inflict possible infection or bodily harm on others trying to enforce social distancing, this is very serious issue that violates the guaranteed rights of others.

If you want to open your business, you are entitled to do so. However, your rights stop when your those actions start to endanger the lives of others. Why is this such a hard concept to grasp?"
2020-05-07 12:42:29,"""As bad as the virus may be, the cost of the virtual national lockdown to my re-election bid has grown too high.""

I've re-written the headline to more accurately reflect Trump's thinking."
2020-05-07 12:51:43,"No. It's all about him.

He knows he has failed with the virus and thinks if he can get the economy going again by November he'll win reelection.

This has nothing to do with anyone's suffering but his own."
2020-05-07 13:04:46,"It is all about reelection and looking good. So, the country will open and, logic says COVID 19 deaths will go up and, by November the economy will not be recovered yet.

I would like to see if that 56% is more likely to vote or will it be that 33%. And, who will they vote for? 

Trump is more insecure than ever because he sees the writing on the wall. He is picturing for the first time losing to somebody he considers a lesser being.

His way out will probably be to follow the lead of Poland and postpone elections or cancel them. In almost 4 months he will reverse course about opening too fast. He will pretend he cares about deaths. Which BTW will look like as an improvement."
2020-05-07 13:07:44,"50 percent of the cases/deaths are in NY and NJ.  A large portion of those are nursing homes - the ""Alamo"" so to speak that we were supposed to protect.  Now that the Alamo is a pile of rubble, whats the point?  

Our kids are getting dumber from no school, our governments are going bankrupt from unemployment costs and reduced tax revenue.   We've done all the good we can do."
2020-05-07 12:42:50,"“The president has made little effort to reconcile his increasing pressure to reopen with the increasing death toll.”

The important phrase from the above is “made little effort.” Apparently, Trump is too lazy to even govern poorly. The only thing stirring the Chosen One to action has to do with re-election. 

With that in mind, beware the near future attacks on the “deep corruption” emanating from the Postal Service. Trump isn’t so lazy that he would leave this ballot carrying agency alone during a mail-in election."
2020-05-07 12:47:36,"It should be obvious by now that trump's singular focus is a futile effort to get reelected; regardless of the consequences for the American people. He will do anything, and say anything to further that purpose. Sadly, the GOP will be willfully supportive in this futile effort as many of them also up for reelection will go down with trump. It would be in the best interests of the country for trump and Pence to resign immediately."
2020-05-07 12:55:02,"Lets be honest:  where we state “the nation” Trump only sees the nation in terms of his own re-election.

Just as many in this country have not participated in the boom times of the last 30 years and have not recovered from 2008’s recession despite the flying stock market.......these same people will surely be wondering how we have defeated this epidemic as they and those around them fall ill.  

And Trump only cares that he can lie again and again and convince them that by opening the country in the midst of an epidemic is “winning” even as the nation loses.

When global travel begins again, we will find that Trump’s America First has done nothing but made us increasingly irrelevant.  That is, if other countries don’t actively quarantine us while we are the global viral hotspot."
2020-05-07 12:30:31,"This sort of reporting normalizes how truly bizarre Trump is. All accounts of the man indicate that he has serious personality disorders and is incapable of running the country. This story projects a notion that he is a rational, functional leader. It's not helpful; in fact, it adds to our problems. Tell the truth. There's either no one home at the top of our government or, if there is someone there, he's a malign force."
2020-05-07 12:38:07,"Trump gives up trying to lead our country through the ongoing health crisis and calls us warriors that need to return to his so called economic front line as workers for the cause. For what to bring back his economic miracle?

This is not a president I’m willing to die for."
2020-05-07 13:13:02,"NYT and the DNC are in a delicious place. Trump keeps recommending the shut down, they will complain about crippling the economy. He recommends easing restrictions, the dramatic reports about deaths will roll in.
The shutdown is not meant to prevent people from getting infected and some of these sick but to prevent them from getting sick at the same time. If there is no danger of hospitals being overwhelmed in large parts of the country, there is little reason to keep bleeding the economy."
2020-05-07 12:50:58,"In sharp contrast to the chaotic, unprincipled and frankly criminal approach of the Trump gang of mobsters, Governor Baker here in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts has shown a sane, quiet and reassuring leadership  -- very similar in its careful steps to Macron's approach in France. Meanwhile, in my home town of Concord, people are learning to enjoy being ""more considerate than thou"" -- ceding each other the right of way, crossing the street, taking an alternative trail in the park, etc.; finding renewed human contact in exercising care of the other at a distance. As Rousseau put it beautifully: ""Physical limitations are easier to bear when the heart is treated right."" Oh, America, find your soul again!"
2020-05-07 13:00:28,"It's not rocket science.  Americans will not venture out of thier homes until we have: mass testing and proven treatments (at the least) and nothing will go back to anything resembling normal until a vaccine.  
Trump has failed on all fronts, especially on testing.  He brags about how many tests we have done but on a per capita basis we don't even crack the top 30 worldwide.  And we have the highest rate of death and caseload.  
So, Mr Trump.  You want to get the economy open?  You best start doing your job or step aside and let someone who is competent do it.  Until then, I am staying home."
2020-05-07 13:05:52,"If this is an event on the scale of 9/11 or Pearl Harbor, why hasn't our President visited the epicenter, NYC, to see first hand the damage?

The main problem has always been that a sudden surge in ill citizens could flood the local health care capacity making treatment for all illnesses more difficult.

At that point health care workers would have to triage. Do you treat the healthy first?  Abbott before Costello?  Spade before Farley?  Norton before Kramden?  We know the rich will go before the poor but after that how do we choose?

I hope we can open in a way that keeps the spread down enough that we don't have to decide who we treat, Laurel or Hardy."

2020-05-07 13:03:29,"This will not be over until everyone has been infected (or immunised). Lockdown simply reduces the current caseload and makes it more manageable. That is what the reopening discussion is about - a manageable caseload until everyone has been infected (or vaccinated ultimately) and the population's immunity is established. Reopening does two things - it starts the process and restarts the economy, which frankly, everyone needs.
I do not think the tone of this article is fair. Perhaps the reporter should be put in charge...."
2020-05-07 13:14:24,"At some juncture several decades ago, Trump clearly decided that his life would be all about having fun, amassing wealth, indulging his insatiable need for attention, exacting revenge on his enemies, never apologizing, never showing any “softness,” never taking a backward step, always being on the attack, and always relying on his lawyers, and loyalists, to protect him from any negative consequences. He never aspired to develop qualities of leadership, and never did.

It was a strategy that got him what he wanted. He sacrificed his humanity for it, though, and the soullessness, lack of empathy, and emotional shallowness of this man who did his deal with the devil so long ago is one of the reasons he is so obviously unaffected by the deaths of more than 73,500 Americans, and over 30 million people who have lost their jobs.

In crises, some people rise to the occasion, and others crumble. This crisis has exposed Trump for what, and who, he is. He is not a leader. He is unfit to lead anyone in a crisis, and he can’t do anything constructive for us, our governors, or our healthcare personnel. Don’t waste your hopes on him. Vote him out of office on Nov. 3rd."
2020-05-07 12:42:39,"I read some of the comments and I am shocked at the number of people who place so little value on human life.  I guess that is why we have a nation with the lowest life expectancy, highest childbirth death rate, massive homeless population and a president who cares more about dollars than deaths.  America is not a nation of ""we"" but the land of ""me.""   Get mine and forget about everyone else.  Capitalism at is finest."

The right wing mantra of small government leaves us with too few resources to wage an effective battle that is of value to all of the country.  We do not have the resources in our health care system and our social safety net to handle the problems presented by this pandemic in an effective manner. So, rather than take extraordinary action and sticking with it, Trump throws up his hands and tries s to  walk away.  The big Orange Flounder in action."
2020-05-07 13:16:11,"He can ""open up"" all he wants, but he can't make people go out and spend money if they don't want to go, and a lot of people won't go until the death count stops accelerating.  

Years ago, I ended up at a party in DC, in a corner talking to the ambassador from Guyana.  The Jim Jones/Jonestown massacre had happened not long before.  I asked the ambassador why the country let such an obviously dangerous man in in the first place.  He said because Jones promised he would ""open up"" the country's interior.  These days, I'm hearing those words echoing in my head and it is even more disturbing today than it was then."
2020-05-07 12:29:55,"The politically jaded person I've become since the beginning of this administration cannot help but think that there is yet another purpose to this rush to reopen.

Given everything else we have witnessed in these nightmarish past three years, I truly would not put it past them."
2020-05-07 13:08:01,"The meaning of life, and death, have long been debated. The meaning of death to Trump is reduced to a public relations impediment that threatens his re-election. Then he and his supporters lie about his dismissal of the threat and his ineffective responses."

Unfortunately, I don't trust the majority of Americans to follow the established social distancing recommendations and personal face-covering suggestions.

2020-05-07 12:56:56,"In this moment of crisis -- when our thought process can become impaired -- it's reassuring that we have a president who knows how to turn seemingly negative into positive news.  Hundreds of thousands COVID deaths?  It would have been millions if not for Trump, so ably assisted by Jared.  Millions of  deaths? We've created more job opportunities for Americans who survive.  Small businesses unable to survive?  We're making our economy more efficient.  A handful of big banks and companies monopolizing every part of our economy?  They're all Trump loyalists assuring us of four more years of the same."
2020-05-07 12:57:50,"There will be no economic recovery, given that the majority of people are not willing to potentially sacrifice themselves or their families.

Trump can encourage the economy to open, but with few customers, businesses will not be sustained and unemployment will remain high.

With the first wave of the virus still raging, the second wave promises to be much worse and, at that time, the disease will certainly be worse than the cure."
2020-05-07 13:03:59,"As in most modern publications, thoughts tend to lean heavily in the direction of the publication's politics. Throughout this comment section, the vast majority of remarks condemn Trump and reopening the country.  The reality is that the longer we stay closed, the more 'deaths' we will see - physical, emotional, economic, spiritual, etc.  This virus will ultimately make its way through the population, and no amount of quarantine will stop it.  Slow it down?  Yes, as evidenced.  But life goes on, and with it a certain amount of risk.  If one wants to hole up for the next 3, 6, or 12 months, that is one's right.  But it is not one's right to force others into that thinking.  There will be more deaths (physical) from the virus no matter how slow the reopening progresses - that is unavoidable.  However, it seems that many feel even one more death cannot be tolerated.  And yes, it likely will continue (no matter what we as a country do) to hit certain demographics worse than others - much like many of life's other risks."
2020-05-07 13:13:47,"We can keep people afloat with government money.  We don't have to force people to show up at jobs where the virus can spread.  We should extend the $600 a week unemployment payment to everyone and for at least the rest of 2020.  Let the Fed create dollars to buy up the resulting federal debt.  The risk of inflation is very low these days.  But Trump and the right-wing oppose this, because it's Big Government.  Better, they think, to see more avoidable deaths."
2020-05-07 12:39:06,"The problem, to me, is that there is no ONE NATIONAL plan to deal with the crisis, even though there could have been one.
We need one leader telling the country here is what we must do to mange this thing to get back to some kind of normalcy, and asking us to buy into the plan. I believe the majority of Americans would have done that.
But, that would take much work over a long time, which would require a great deal of focus from the leader.
Instead, there are just 50 different plans in place. We look like a patchwork quilt.
Some governors just gave up and said “OK, reopen”. Others are continuing the fight.
Here in PA, we are still in stay at home orders, where next door in WV, restrictions have eased. So, what do people do? We have Pennsylvanians crossing the WV border to get haircuts!!  Sad."
2020-05-07 12:31:41,"For those advocating a quick opening despite having failed to invest in the tools that allow for managing the risks of opening (broad testing, contact tracing, support for those who need to quarantine safely, etc.), I presume with your great courage and moral certitude that you are ready to on take all these risks yourself.

So please sign and submit your DNR (do not resuscitate) orders so you won’t be taking away an ICU bed or ventilator from someone else.  And, of course, please provide your bank routing number and account info to your neighbors since I’m sure you will want to take responsibility for those you infect.

Let us all know what you have completed these steps so we can appreciate you for the courage to act on your convictions."

But our government was not founded on the idea of reviving and promoting the economy even over doing our utmost to protect lives.  That's an illegitimate government according to our Declaration of Independence.  In my view, those calling to relax social distancing guidelines are putting us at risk.  It's no different than if they were pointing a gun at us."

2020-05-07 13:12:32,"Here is a little discussion of why, even if we had a ""open up the economy"" decision all across the country, things would not ""snap back"".

""A new report from the Becker Friedman Institute at the University of Chicago predicts 42 percent of the recent layoffs from the pandemic will result in permanent job losses. There are two big issues: First, many companies are going bankrupt or shutting down permanently, so they won’t need workers. Second, even after parts of the economy reopen, many people will be hesitant to shop, travel and go out to eat as they did before. Businesses operating at half capacity or switching to online or takeout don’t need nearly as many workers.""

The article says that 77% of laid off workers think they will get their old job back.

I think many of those people are going to be in for a rude awakening.

This looks to me like a version of the 1930s Great Depression.  The financial damage is going to be monumental.  The personal damage to many people will be even worse, between the health issues and the economic issues."

However it will not work. This is not the economy versus the virus. This is the virus controlled or nothing. This virus exposes the fragility of our modern lives."

2020-05-07 13:01:43,"Of course tRump is pivoting to the economy, as the horse has left the barn, so to speak. Warnings about the corona virus and its threat to the U.S., from top Intelligence and Military advisors, were ignored by tRump as early as November 2019. tRump calls attention to closing travel from China in February as some great measure, but thousands of travel from China still occurred afterwards. Europe was experiencing increased cases in January and February, U.S citizens and Europeans traveled back and forth at this time, spreading the tinder that was to become the NYC COVID-19 inferno. 

November & December 2019 and January & February were the months to have been assembling the teams of scientists and medical professionals to game plan the response, all the while stockpiling PPE and working with all the States on how to marshal in the plan to battle the pandemic. The tRump administrations dismantling of teams that handled global health and biodefense on the National Security Council was a major blunder as well.

The missteps that have led to the disastrous pandemic response began the day tRump stepped into the White House. tRump and his administration need to be thoroughly investigated over the handling of the corona virus response, vast corruption and profiteering has been one of the focal points for tRump, as opposed to helping Americans."

It is impossible to get tested unless you show symptoms,  The USA doesn't have the tools needed to confront this pandemic.  Isolation and social distance is our only recourse.

2020-05-07 12:43:28,"By saying “In a way, by doing all this testing we make ourselves look bad” Mr. Trump made it very clear that he isn’t interested to fight the virus and protect people, instead he is only interested in “his” ranking compared to others. May I observe that the U.S.A. are already leading in both, the number of infections but also in the number of deaths. Quite contrary, that will very likely not change in the near future. So, he is already “leading” the pack in that ranking. All countries which are more successful in containing the virus has achieved this by extensive testing and the separation and quarantine of infected persons to break the chain of infections. Just to close your eyes from the reality doesn’t result in being successful in this particular case. You might temporarily “look good” in terms of number of infections (e.g. like North Korea), but ultimately the hard facts later will be the number of dead people, which no moron can deny (but I’m not sure of every moron out there).
Normal leaders would be more compassionate for their constituents, but the current incumbent of the office of President seems to be not really interested in people. It’s up to the voters to change this in November."

It should be really about the marginal benefit afforded by extending shutdown versus economic costs of doing so. Continued economic shutdown is painful and affects health and well-being of millions, but the benefits of opening up the economy has to be weighed against whether or not each state or locality is in a position to prevent an out of control resurgence of epidemic that will overwhelm the hospitals, create panic and return us to square one, and yield no economic benefits. Wishful thinking and prayers have to be replaced by action plans for each scenario."

Clearly things would be quite different today had trump not been so mindlessly reckless!

This will not end well for Mr. Trump or his enablers who deserve every bit of it from critics while continuing to bounce around people without masks.

We started too late.  The economy has been stomped on but we didn't knock back the pandemic because, you know, freedom.  And now all these pro-life conservatives are willing to throw hundreds of thousands of Americans under the bus.

The ironic side of this might be that the virus is now raging in rural America.  NY is over the hump.  I've read that the deaths in NC, PA, and MI will favor Trump supporters by more than 10,000 voters per state.  Those who had to go to church, those who paraded around protesting tyranny without masks are now more likely to die than us sniveling mask-wearing 
liberals.

If I could wave a magic wand and make it go away I would.  But we have a president who follows magical thinking, responsibility avoidance, and blame shedding.  Who is most concerned with his pill numbers and TV ratings.  This might even be a bridge too far for Jared the Wonderboy.

Now, during a worldwide pandemic that has affected the USA, President Trump announces he'll disband the Coronavirus task force, and then announces, that, because of the task force's popularity, he'll keep the taskforce going.  In his task force briefings, he described the drug Remdesivir as ""hot,""  and Drs. Birx and Fauci as ""rock stars.""

Each rolling shutdown will lead to massive jobs losses, successively worse than the last time as businesses fail permanently, leading to more lost revenue, with state and local governments in a real danger of collapse without billions - perhaps trillions - in bailouts.

Contact tracing in a big city like NYC will not work.  I have an idea for saving the government a lot of time and money in contact tracing:  if you left the house today, you came into contact with someone with Covid.

Contact tracing for a difficult-to-spread disease like HIV/AIDS would actually have a shot at working, and yet nobody is calling for that.  I wonder why?"
2020-05-07 13:32:38,"People may denounce Trump's choice to free the economy, even at the expense of greater contagion and death by the coronavirus.  But it greatly favors his re-election.  Tens of millions of unemployed are a greater menace at the polls than a mere million who die and won't vote.   To continue lockdown would spare only some of the casualties anyway.

If the economy remains sluggish, Trump can blame it on defeatism emanating from his opponents.  A steady tide of deaths he can blame on China, immigrants, or a conspiracy of globalist scientist who fail to endorse his game-changing quick cures.  He can unveil and unproven vaccine or elixir and blame his enemies for shoddy ASAP implementation.  If a vaccine originates abroad, fear and suspicion come to Trump's rescue.

Higher infection and mortality will cause many to fear to vote.  The few people who do vote will be disproportionately individuals who disbelieve in the dangers and strongly favor Trump.  The mantra: ""He needs no mask, so neither do I.""   

Many Trump voters like him precisely because he never admits mistakes, steadily attacks, and always sticks to his guns.  To them, the 2nd Amendment takes priority over all other matters.  Guns comfort and solace.  If not, why do we have more guns than people in this country.  Thus, when in doubt, many Americans will vote for the guy who kept the gun stores open and who championed the armed MAGA mobs that storm state capitols or city halls ruled by face-masked ""enemies of freedom."""
2020-05-07 13:21:17,"I'm already hearing reports that the Covid-19 cases and deaths are being exaggerated.

Trump is carrying out phase II of his malign spin to get reelected.  He's going to claim that the media and the Democrats are playing with the numbers.  He's made every attempt to keep the numbers low because he refuses to impose the Defense Production Act to create more kits for each state.

The states know the numbers, no matter how much Trump tries to create a conspiracy theory about them.  According to experts, the numbers are underreported because of testing.

If the numbers are this bad, Trump won't be able to pull off this swindle.  It won't be much longer before everyone knows a friend or loved one lost to this virus.

Even Trump can't will, cheat, or talk this virus away.  It will follow him to into the annals of history."
2020-05-07 13:18:39,"Shutdown Wasted. The president and the federal government utterly failed to use the time of the shutdown to prepare for the extended waves of infection that are coming. This should have been a time to ramp up the supply chain of testing materials, emergency food supplies, PPE, and for designing and planning a rapid response infrastructure to coordinate state and regional action to contain new outbreaks.

Instead, they dithered and engaged in a campaign of misinformation and conspiracy mongering. Had their been appropriate and mature leadership, the shutdown could have ended the crisis. Instead it simply planted the seeds for a prolonged period of death and disruption.

You FAILED Mr. President."
2020-05-07 13:21:55,"Man, people just don’t get it. It’s amazing. 

Flattening the curve does NOT mean people don’t die. Read that again. It means they die at a slower rate, so hospitals are not overwhelmed. That was the orIginal idea that everyone seems to ha e forgotten. We NEVER had a chance to stop this virus, just like every other country. Our deaths are pretty similar more capita to other countries, or even worse then those who had far less severe lockdown. What makes anyone think we could have been the only country on earth to be spared? 

To stay in lockdown to stop this virus makes zero sense. Zero. The best we can do is keep at risk people at home while the rest of us get back to work. 

Otherwise, let’s do like China and have a complete lockdown of the entire country and have the government track every person like a police state"
2020-05-07 13:28:07,"The President’s response to this pandemic, though extremely disappointing, is, sadly, not surprising.  Seems to me he’s more concerned about the state of the economy, and his chances for re-election, than the health and well-being of the American public.   

I think all of us here are agreed on the fact that we cannot continue to keep the economy shuttered indefinitely.  Eventually, we will need to reopen businesses.  

The question is how we do it, and do it in such a way as to keep as many of us safe.  The components for reopening businesses safely — widespread testing (esp. for front-line personnel and those working in food-processing centers), contact tracing, quarantining those who have been infected/exposed, and treatment, are ALL needed.  I’m not hearing this President heavily advocate for this — apparently, the blue-print he had the CDC come up with (which doesn’t include some of the elements I’ve listed above), he’s more than willing to jettison, all in the name of the almighty dollar.

To those who want to open the country back up quickly, I ask this question — if people are too afraid of getting sick or dying from coronavirus, and yet they remain at sea as to who’s infected vs. who is not, do you honestly believe anyone will be willing to spend money to dine out, get a man-pedi, get a hair cut, take a trip, etc.?  If businesses open back up and yet know one shows up to patronize those businesses, what will happen to the economy then?"
2020-05-07 13:35:37,"It is a fact that testing reveals the facts about how wide spread and where the virus is. It is a fact that Trump does not want you to know the facts about that.  More testing reveals more infections and therefore increases the numbers. 
Here's what he said yesterday:
“In a way, by doing all this testing we make ourselves look bad.” 
   Indeed the truth indicated by the numbers makes Donald Trump ""look bad."" As would the facts gathered by records and witnesses about his crimes and money laundering that he refuses to allow you to see, but are the subject of the SCOTUS hearing about to happen."

With the economy in free fall and the death toll mounting we can expect Trump to pivot to savaging Biden.

Because Trump cannot lead and is in way over his head, has surrounded himself with political hacks and yes-men (and the odd yes-woman), and is solely focused on the economy and re-opening, there is no reason to believe the rates of infection and death rates will fall until there is a widely-available vaccination and/or treatment. Because Trump has isolated the US, turning us into a pariah (just watch, when the world has re-opened to the point where there is international travel again, travel from the US will be banned); his belief that a Great America can go it alone will kill us all. American companies are moving ahead with vaccines, but so are the *consortiums* comprised of multi-national teams. Given Trump's rhetoric directed toward China, should they develop the vaccine first, do you possibly think the US will be at the head of the list for that vaccine?"

2020-05-07 13:20:48,"Donald Trump, as he has done his entire life, rejects the solutions which require detailed study and reliance on qualified experts, and he foolishly declares victory over the Covid-19 pandemic. Our president is willingly trading American lives for a dramatic uptick in business and new life for the stock market, which he has always confused with the economy.

Trump, once again, is wrong on all counts. The virus is still winning. The majority of the American people understand the continuing danger and will not opt for business as usual. Any rise in the stock market will be temporary. A likely resurgence of the virus in the autumn will cost further unnecessary loss of life and also will precipitate an economic tragedy rivaling the Great Depression."

Child malnutrition alone has increased by at least seven million due to our response (the life-long negative impact on these children is unconscionable). Domestic violence is skyrocketing. Stress related illnesses and substance abuse are rapidly increasing. And the profile for those at risk, 94 percent, involves having one or more of only three underlying pre-existing medical conditions. The human suffering collateral damage of our myopic, one size fits all, approach is enormous and growing.

If we don't start to reopen, are we prepared to face the consequences of childhood malnutrition hitting ten million with its associated life-long damage to those kids?  Are we prepared for all the other human collateral damage to continue to grow?  And, are we prepared for the real possibility that the societal hole we are digging becomes so deep that no set of federal stimulus, unemployment, etc. programs will be able to get us out."

With 1,000-2,000 dying per day, that's 30,000-60,000 likely to die each month.  This adds up to 250,000 to 430,000 deaths before the election.  

The president is leading a culture war that will result in many people going back to their social routines while defiantly rejecting masks and social distancing; and those who limit their contacts, wear masks, and patiently wait for the environment to become less of a risk.  

I'm concerned about those who don't have the luxury of a choice, who become collateral damage in this culture war."

Articles have reported the different economic outcomes during the 1918 pandemic : the US cities with the best economic outcomes were the ones which took aggressive steps to stop the spread of the Spanish flu virus over longer periods of time.
It is obvious that in the next 6 months America will suffer a resurgence of hospitalizations and deaths, Which will lead us to learn the hard way that the economy cannot be restored until the Covid 19 virus has been contained. 
Trump's strategy is suicidal both economically and in terms of public health. It is reckless and shortsighted to relax lockdowns before widespread testing has been implemented."

2020-05-07 13:50:24,"It's not health vs the economy; it's health vs health.  The people suffering from the shutdown are NOT the top 50%, it's overwhelmingly the BOTTOM 50%.  

Look at who is unemployed and getting stale.  The digital economy is soaring while the physical economy is in a coma. Emerging graduates have no jobs to go to. The stimulus money will only last a couple months.

The shutdown is chemotherapy to retard the C19 cancer.  Chemotherapy will kill the weakest; the shutdown will do the same.  Chemotherapy also kills the immune system; staying at home slowly does pretty much the same.

The shutdown has become a political issue; the victims will be the least able to survive it.

The only way out is to smartly reopen as soon as possible.  Let's stop being political and start working the reopening solution much harder."
2020-05-07 13:52:22,"Trump has proven, time and again, that he is allergic to facts and logic.  I am truly surprised that people still look to him for guidance and leadership.  When I want to get information about COVID-19, for example, I'll go the CDC website or listen to a governor's press conference.  There is simply nothing of value, no substance, nothing to learn from listening to the President.  It's time that the media stop obsessing so much over what an irrelevant, impotent, and weak-minded President says and provide more coverage of the leaders that are, you know, leading."

2020-05-07 13:46:03,"“And not just more deaths, but also a rationale for denying additional unemployment benefits and other vital assistance to those on the lower rungs of the economic ladder.”

Exactly so.  This is class warfare at its finest.  Those who have the ability to work safely from home, and the means to have whatever services they need delivered to them have the CHOICE to isolate or not.   It is unconsciounable to compare their decisions to those who are forced to show up for work, sick or not, because they have no income, no paid sick leave, and no other employment options given the current state of the economy.   trump and the corrupt gop are more than willing to sacrifice these people, and will certainly squeeze them unmercifully by putting them in a classic Catch 22 situation."
2020-05-07 13:50:14,"“I think he has given up on the hard stuff and as a consequence is writing off people’s lives.""  Based upon the other statements he's made I agree.  Trump has decided that working Americans can be sacrificed for his re-election.  I assume that McConnell agrees as do the rest of Trump's cabinet.  

There are a few questions if the country opens up and things worsen.  Who will take care of the orphaned children?  Who will staff the hospitals?  Who will keep the infrastructure going?  What about food, the distribution of food, tax collections, education, housing, sanitation, etc.?  Without money we'll have to revert to a barter economy.  There's a small problem with that:  some things cannot be paid for in barter; taxes, gasoline, housing, public schools...

Long before Trump was elected this country's voters made certain decisions.  They elected people who wanted to drown the government, who would give them tax cuts, who were divisive, who supported punitive programs rather than programs to help all of us.  We are responsible for the predicament we're facing.  If we had thought with our brains instead of our hearts we might have avoided some of this.  We didn't.  We have no social safety net, shortages of vital PPE, an incompetent leader, and nowhere to go.  

In the end we are paying for our votes to be cheap.  This is the end result of being penny wise and pound foolish."

2020-05-07 13:46:56,"So Trump is now thinking that he can win in November with this strategy. Since we will never be able to test everyone and the economy is in free fall, open it now. With the vaccine coming out after the election, it cannot help him win.  So.. let the chips fall where they may. My prediction is that by November, 80 percent of the US will be infected. Millions will die. The economy will still have record unemployment. We will see if that translates into a win."
2020-05-07 13:48:16,"As much as this is Trump's fault, dems are going to find themselves outmaneuvered if they don't move quickly to reopen. Here in Belgium, which has a higher death rate than the US, things began reopening already two and a half weeks ago. That's in part because a quarantine won't become more effective if people aren't participating. So at some point you have to cut your losses and move on. And WaPo is reporting that 80% of people think they're going to get their old jobs back. So sure, if that's what they think, they support the lockdown! When they find out they were wrong and that dems lead them down this path, will they feel the same? Very doubtful. In any case, glad I'm living here and not there. A dose of moderation seems beyond my party... and country."
2020-05-07 13:55:10,"The coronavirus cannot survive outside a living host. If a shutdown had been more strongly enforced and more carefully followed the number of new cases would have been greatly reduced to a more manageable level. Instead there was little or no coordination on a national level, and less than stellar compliance. The result is that we are hardly better off than we were before. A perfect example of how not to manage a pandemic. What a mess."
2020-05-07 13:58:28,"Yes Mr Trump. Time to move on is long overdue. Not to move on will be a message that we will hold back adult Americans below age 65 without helping those over 65. The large number of deaths in nursing homes were due to poor design and planning of nursing homes. Each occupant from nursing homes should have been housed in a separate unit and not be in rooms with central heating and air conditioning. I understand the state of Florida with a high percent of those above 60 did very well compared to those in densely populated NY city. 

In future, all nursing homes and senior living communities should learn from what went wrong in densely populated ill prepared NY compared to other states and there has to be better regulation in preparation and preparedness for the next pandemic which could be realistically expected within 5 years. Affordable home care should also become a major service to our beloved seniors and hospitalizations restricted for emergencies and surgeries."
2020-05-07 14:29:34,"It seems clear that Trump has realized he can neither defend nor win reelection based on his handling of this crisis.  Consequently, he is gambling that the risks of restarting the economy aren't as severe as the epidemiological data suggests.  Of course, if he loses this gamble, there will be many, many more illnesses and deaths.  Those are the stakes."

3. Functional understanding of the germ theory of disease
4. Accept risk of bringing disease home to loved ones

2020-05-07 14:44:31,"Can Trump be both right and wrong?   Keeping the country completely closed will ultimately become disastrous.   Opening the wrong way may lead to countless deaths.   Unfortunately, what he is right about is for all the wrong reasons; his personal success vs. that of the country.  

There is a middle ground.   Protecting the most vulnerable among us is a good place to start.   Using the Federal Government's power for protocols which protect workers in the food industry, enhanced testing to permit appropriate isolation and contact tracing, and using our R&D to develop fast result tests which can permit the population to co-mingle safely in restaurants, shops and public transportation.  This of course includes teachers who need reassurance to return to classrooms in the Fall.   There is lots that can be done to both open and protect the population.   The president just needs to recognize that serving is not being self serving."

This dark strand, of ""rugged individualism"" led directly to the full blown Great Depression under Herbert Hoover. Hoover, a far more intelligent man than Trump, was nevertheless not up to the task of saving the economy in the face of excess. Hoovervilles were the result. 

Trump is both willfully ignorant (Hoover was not- he was a trained engineer with a degree from Stanford), and exceed Hoover by far in a lack of empathy for the common man. 

The result is what I would refer to as The Trump Pandemic. Trump has always, also, been ""unraveled"". Unlike Hoover, Trump arose from the ""lunatic fringe"", a result of America's fascination with television and no less astounding than the characterizations in a Paddy Chayefsky film like Network. Or, perhaps, Steven King's Dead Zone.

2020-05-07 14:36:32,"The numbers don't lie, even if Trump does. His callous disregard for life and obliviousness to human tragedy is staggering.

Red state and rural America are experiencing a steep rise in disease and mortality, while those who have acted are finally experiencing significant reductions.

This is a warning. Don't be stupid. The next pain and suffering is going to weigh heavily on rural areas, which are ill equipped to handle the suffering. 

Thanks to steep cuts in helping and health care programs, there is a lot less.

Thanks to giveaways to the wealthy and powerful, there is a lot less.

Thanks to deregulation, pollution and toxic conditions will contribute to all our problems.

Thanks to ignorance, expertise is being sidelined.

Thanks to vote cheating and propaganda, elections will have to be overwhelming, but I think they will.

Punters, it's time to give up your illusions. Throwing good after bad will only make failure worse."

2020-05-07 14:04:25,"Trump wants to ""open the country"" because he thinks the economy is the key to winning the next election.

What is surprising about this?

His economic plan was laid bare each day of his Presidency ; The centerpiece was growing the economy at any cost, even if that meant killing and hurting people via increased pollution, decreasing worker's safety requirements, destroying healthcare protections or tax cuts that inflated the stock market.

From the moment Covid-19 was upon us, the only thing that mattered to him was the virus' threat to the economy, and more importantly his reelection.  

But his new economic ""growth"" plan has a new twist.  We are all now ""warriors"" for Trump, and he is gambling the virus' culling will spare enough people to see the economy improve just enough and pave the road to his reelection.

Trump can hem and haw about Democrats trying to destroy him with the economy, but truth is, he is going to lose the next election in a landslide partly because he is a miserable human being who values GDP over human life.

He has forced many of us into a horrible false dichotomy, GDP vs life.  

That is Trump's world in a nutshell.  Survive or die. 

Time for the nation to move on from this nonsense.

Covid-19 is the symptom not the disease."
2020-05-07 14:08:01,"We're talking about sanctioning manslaughter. Playing god.  This man failed miserably to lead during a crisis, and now wants Americans to suicidally sacrifice themselves on the alter of big business.  He's moved to bail out airlines, and cruise lines. He's moved to provide unfettered access to the public trough to hedge funds and brokers.  He's moved to provide liability protection to agribusiness megacorporations to force their workers to work, get sick, and die.

Where has he moved to help the little guy, like he always campaigns?"
2020-05-07 14:18:12,"This piece tries to treat Trump with a level of respect analagous to that rightly given to past Presidents despite his egregious destructive conduct and incessant lying in dealing with our catastrophe.  Ironically, the delayed spread of COVID to the red and purple states seems likely to dim the enthusiasm of some of the MAGA hat and ""personal liberty to die"" crowd as the election nears.  Lets hope they get the message."
2020-05-07 14:33:44,"President Trump sets up a three phase ""safe"" re-opening plan. He has already ditched his own regulations and decalred open up even if you have not met the phase 1 rules. He goes to the mask company, wears safety glasses but doesn't wear a safety mask! Oh, I didn't have to, I wasn't anywhere near the workers. That is a lie. He is on tape at least twice getting within two feet of two workers wearing masks. Because he won't wear a mask people all over the country will stop wearing theirs. 
   He doesn't care. Trump and the Mar-a-lago set will not have to work 40 hours in a crowded workplace with large amount of workers and customers. The workers of color will have a far larger percentage of their population share of the death totals. The people who will die are not the people who fund the Republican party. He wants business to open, but the White House is not resuming tours of the White House? Why? Because that would threaten his life. because it's not safe to have large numbers of people from all over the country crowding into the White House and spreading the Virus. That is reserved for the rest of us."
2020-05-07 14:00:41,"Peter Baker’s description of Trump’s framing of testing is that more of it “only reveals more infections and therefore increases the number. ‘In a way, by doing all this testing we make ourselves look bad,’ he said.”

But his political calculus may be more encompassing than that. Even more than the push to reopen in the hope that it will supposedly revive the economy by election time.  

It could even be thought of as a permanent form of voter suppression. Baker’s article describes how the virus disproportionately affects more people who are economically-disadvantaged, both by sickening and killing them, and by making it harder for them to support themselves economically. 

This cohort of people are more likely to vote for Biden in November. But if they are sick or dead or having to struggle to support themselves they’ll be gone, or far less likely to physically go to the polls, which may be necessary if the Republicans kill off voting by mail. 

I certainly hope that Trump and his allies aren’t thinking like this."
2020-05-07 14:16:15,"This situation would test the capabilities of the best leadership. Even with a Lincoln or a Roosevelt in the White House, finding a way to maintain health and open the economy would be a challenge.

And so we will have many more deaths with little improvement in the economy and untold damage to our health care system.  Dead people don't buy."
2020-05-07 14:29:48,"More evidence of the obvious: President Trump doesn’t know what he’s doing, he is a lousy executive, he is not really president, he just plays the role on tv.

Trump’s approach involves at least the following: lower taxes on big corporations and rich people, like himself; subsidies to help large businesses especially in real estate and hospitality, like his, get through the crisis; a reinstatement of the amount of spending in upscale saloons and eateries, like his,  that can be deducted as business expenses...

His blather about the lockdown being worse than the pandemic is some kind of dream - the pandemic will go on, and the rebound under his leadership will be brutal."

I wonder, would they all show up?"
2020-05-07 14:24:14,"As horrible as Trump is, this is all about more than him. It’s about a wealthy nation that has ignored emergency preparedness, infrastructure, and safety nets. “Don’t tread on me” is a complete failure. The “free market” has no answer for this disaster other than saying the show must go on even if thousands of people are dying daily with no end in site. People who work in the service industry and manufacturing - along with the front lines of healthcare - are paying the price. Meanwhile, the stock market is pretending things are fine. We do need a new president, but America needs to change its mindset to one where we all take care of each other much more."
2020-05-07 14:17:10,"It’s easy for trump to say reopen when he and those around him have access to rapid virus tests.

Remember in the early pressers he boasted that he didn’t have to be tested or was it he didn’t know if he was tested.  Oh whatever.  But now he can be tested and know quickly the results.

He isn’t crying testing, testing testing because he is being tested.

Vote them out then lock them up 2020"
2020-05-07 14:29:39,"How can the economy come back by reopening? Businesses can't ""go back to  normal"" in the  midst of an uncontrolled epidemic. As workers return to workplaces, virus cases will rise. Businesses will have depleted work forces, and many smaller businesses could see 100% of their workers sick at home or hospitalized at the same time. How can a business operate with a majority of its workers sick? Plus, sick workers can't collect unemployment and many employers don't offer sick pay. All those sick workers would be without any income at all. How is that better for the economy?"
2020-05-07 14:16:04,"I am not sure why Trump has resisted meeting this problem head on. Get a program going to put testing and tracking in place and then open up everything.

Is this what we’ve become? Capitalism at any cost? I’m disgusted with my country right now. Some folks are more concerned about their purse or politics than public health. History will not be kind to us. Let’s at least hope that this finally ends the money madness in America and makes us realize what’s important: people’s lives. But it’s not looking that way.

The science around this particular virus is young, but many scientists are quite honest about what we know and what we don't know.   We know enough to know that the impulse to get back to normal is an invitation to self-destruction, especially when new cases of the virus continue on the upswing and deaths are growing at a very fast rate.   Those of us who follow the science aren't interested in mass suicide."
2020-05-07 14:44:31,"No major newspaper is covering massive outbreaks in meatpacking plants in Iowa, Indiana, Nebraska, Colorado and other rural states. Trump can point to declining national totals and say it's time to re-open, but infections are overwhelming hospitals and first responders in the non-coastal states.

2020-05-07 14:14:30,"I'm surprised that a very basic question hasn't yet been asked by the press, and by not doing so, we are all tagging along with the White House plan to reopen.

Question is, how many more new cases and/or how many new deaths will it take for states to close back up again?

If we know that new cases would more than likely continue to increase, and that is what got us here in the first place; lets get the W.H. and Governors on the record now."
2020-05-07 14:24:34,"""We have to be warriors."" So said Donald. I wonder where that attitude was during the Vietnam war. 

If we are going to be warriors for our Commander-in-Chief, we can't fight the enemy without the proper equipment. The enemy is national in scope. We can't defeat the enemy if we have 50 separate battle plans. And, to defeat the enemy, we all need to fight, that includes protestors who refuse to follow directions or shoot those who do. 

Finally we need to know that if we die by going back to work, how that promotes the greater good of the nation. Our death doesn't mean the enemy is weakened. It means only that it has claimed another victim."
2020-05-07 14:46:03,"Deceptive heading:  the logic is not clear because it does not specify the badness of the cure and compare it to any specific cost.  The heading is deceptive because in 'normal English' to say logic is clear implies that it is correct.  If it's wrong it isn't logical.
The president has failed to present a specific strategy for cure or to provide the means to achieve the cure. He has rescued large corporations without complaining about the cost.  He has not provided for the loss of income of front-line workers.  His illogical solution is that those who have suffered the most must continue to suffer the loss of life."

2020-05-07 14:33:01,"Trump's issuing a signing statement, more accurately a selective revision of a law passed by Congress designed to reflect the compromise between the two houses of Congress and the President is his arrogation of position of absolute ruler of this country. 

This appropriation was similar to our response to Dec.7, 1941, when all resources were allocated to War against the Axis forces.   It happened to end the depression as top executives in industry took a dollar year salary.  Trump is giving these CEOs more millions in perks, while the number of children going hungry are increasing. 

Signing statements have long been meaningless, but Trump, having his own Supreme Court and Senate majority has now made it a a statement that is the ending our Constitutional based government, refined over a course of centuries.    

It could be more useful is we acknowledge the de-facto transformation that is now a reality.  Those in this position manage to find a way to avoid the will of the people  in a plebiscite"
2020-05-07 14:01:30,"For the president and many conservatives, the choice is a simple one: ""perfect"" health or the economy. ""Liberals"" (meaning people likely to consult scientists rather than relying on their ""gut"") try to legislate away all the risks in life, and the lockdown is just another instance of their misguided paternalism. This is a familiar mindset.  But reality is not quite so simple as these stereotypes would lead us to believe. 

The economic hit to our country is severe. The lock down does impose a cost. But a premature opening leading to a spike in hospitalizations and deaths is not going to lead to a restored growth, but will only prolong the period of depression. Business activity will remain severely curtailed, even when lockdowns end. But meanwhile, our medical services can become overwhelmed, and many people who need care will be unable to get it. 

What we need to do, obviously, is to expand testing and contact tracing nationwide, using all available resources of the state and federal governments, and extend services so that people can survive the downturn, such as by full wage replacement. We do need to end the lockdown, but we need to it it safely, or we will just compound our economic woes, as well as bring about a needlessly high death toll. 

Many conservatives seem convinced that the plague will never affect them. It will be confined to major cities and, let's be frank, to black and brown people, not ""people like us"". But this is both immoral and a dangerous delusion."
2020-05-07 14:46:52,"If Trump wanted to speed up opening the economy he would have followed the epidemic playbook Obama left him which emphasized having enough testing so that outbreaks could be spotted and stamped out. Instead, Trump says, doing testing makes us look bad.

So we will go blindly forth into stores and restaurants, hospitals and workplaces, factories and nursing homes, not knowing who is infected, and no testing and tracing regimen in place when people inevitably get sick, undoing all the good we did by staying at home for weeks.

Governors have been pleading with Trump to use his power to help provide tests; but instead he forces states to bid against each other. It’s a 50-ring circus and all states are on their own. Some states will do better; but the problem is infections don’t stop at the state line.

Meanwhile there is a report about how Germany has used testing and tracing to keep its industry going and now is opening up its economy more safely. But never mind. That’s Germany. And we are Trump’s USA USA USA."

Four more years of Republican leadership and we’ll have four beds per room and four seniors per bed and pre-dug graves in nursing home grounds. Ironic that Republicans squealed like stuck pigs when we wanted doctors to be paid for end-of-life counseling. Now they just want the elderly (except their own rich parents and grandparents of course) to just die already. Because profits are all that matters."
2020-05-07 15:07:22,"Because he is so ignorant, inept, corrupt and uncaring, Trump wants to wave his magic wand to make coronavirus disappear and declare “Mission Accomplished” when, in fact, the numbers of sick and dying are increasing outside of New York State, where Governor Cuomo has demonstrated what an actual, competent leader looks like. He wants to be perceived as having mastered the worst crisis in history, and rally patriots around him like Pearl Harbor and 9/11. The fact that the 1 million dead mark has not been reached only means that the coronavirus pandemic hasn’t finished its work.

So I will not say that he is evil. Make up your own mind. Examine what drives your thoughts.

Children going hungry. Children in prisons built for children. Children who have now lost their parents or their parent. Disabled children now in foster care in a tragic system failing and failing and failing. Dead children from group homes. Children infected with a buddy variation of Covid that is as virulent as Covid. Children who have never had health care. Children who have been axed from healthcare by Donald Trump and his crime syndicate out to throw anyone not like them to the wolves. Children and their education thrown under the bus. Children who are not going to live. They are going to die alone. There will be a lot of them. We will blame Trump.

Are we prepared or are we lead by a man whose compass has never worked.

Or are we lead by a man who has never worked himself. Trump has no empathy. Trump thinks it's about the money. It's about Trump. It's about death. It's about suffering. It's about institutional ruins. It's about coffins. Now, it's about hunger.

Children in Venezuela get it. Hunger itself is often the driver of unmitigated, violent change. Blaming Trump will be ephemeral."

To me, the blankets that have been covering the destructive nature of capitalism have been pulled back and we are able to see that it is all about the rich getting more and the rest of the peons can eke out their living as they aren't worth much and are expendable. Yet, these same people who support this administration are holier-than-thou in regards to their right to live their lives and the government not intervene regarding their bodies.

Subconsciously a lot of people are hoping to push it thru close to the election so Trump doesn't get re-elected. Of course that is not set in stone.

I am completely aware that this administration has ushered in a golden age of ignorance, but is this all we get? Some ridiculous propaganda that even a true believer must find difficult to swallow, particularly when many other countries have done far better? The choice is not between reopening and staying at home, but making the choices about how to reopen safely. For some bizarre reason, Trump’s approach to reopening is to do it as dangerously as possible (gather in crowds with guns not masks).

I wish one reporter would ask Trump or Pence to describe the virus testing procedures used to protect them and their families, so those who are encouraged to go out into the world without protective gear and testing will know just how important their lives really mean to these con men."

So every time we pass one of Trump’s death toll mile markers (his metric for personal victory and example of leadership) he will say it was an unforeseeable circumstance and raise the bar? When we reach 100,000 deaths by June 1st because he favored the economy over human lives and supported domestic terrorism over medical experts he will just announce the next level of acceptable deaths and again claim victory? Remember when Republicans screamed that Obamacare would result in “Death Squads” condemning Grandma to die before her time? Witness Trumpcare. Mass deaths are just a cost overrun for Trump in his dystopian world. And with a disproportionate number of racial and ethnic minorities in the death toll (as this article states and based on nationwide metrics) the voter rolls are being purged of probable Democratic voters. The virus is being allowed to do the Republicans' work for them. This is just evil incarnate."
2020-05-07 15:02:35,Maybe Trump's master plan is to postpone the election in November by causing a second wave that will be greater than the first wave; resulting in further action by states to implement longer community pause policies.
2020-05-07 15:02:45,"The ""cost is too high"" of not reopening the economy only for Trump whose epic mismanagement of the Covid-19 virus pandemic and its consequent disastrous effect on the economy he was counting on to ride to victory in November. For the rest of us the cost of rushing to reopen for business will be the lives of at least another 100,000 preventable deaths. Trump's incessant narcissistic selfishness is rushing the nation to a real ""American carnage"" of immense tragic proportions that will, as has been his business hallmark, leave the country totally bankrupt and in a real major depression as the economy totally collapses under the relentless spread of the virus along with death and poverty across the land."
2020-05-07 15:06:08,"Obviously, the President hopes that by many parts of the country re-opening now (even though vast parts are clearly not ready), the national economy will be greatly improved in the 3rd and 4th quarters. And if it takes a massive amount of death to get the economy on somewhat better footing, so be it, as Trump thinks this will get him 4 more years. 

The re-openings will do the opposite of what Trump wants, as many more people will die, and the national economy will not improve much. Sensible people will continue to avoid high risk places, and consumer spending will not approach pre-crisis levels for years. 

Trump's terrible decisions will cost him a second term, and that's the only silver lining in a year when massive amounts of avoidable deaths could have been avoided."
2020-05-07 10:52:19,"We don’t have a national testing plan because testing would reveal how bad this is. Trump does not want that. 

He wants us to reopen because he can declare victory. No testing number to contradict him. 

He thinks he can spin the resulting death toll. After all without sufficient or accurate testing how can anyone believe any number the press reports?

All this and we find out the man CAN do calculus. A deadly calculus."

We are not seen as warriors, constituents, mothers, fathers, sons, or daughters; we are seen as impediments to this man’s reelection. From the outset there has been a reckless disregard for our lives, propelled by avarice and ego. People can see this. They can see that this administration isn’t motivated by compassion. Throughout this, there has been no expression of sadness or warmth from Trump, only the banal screed of how badly he’s being treated."
2020-05-07 11:06:08,"Why are liberals so afraid to get on with their lives?  We have two choices:  hide or live.  It's really that simple.

People die everyday and there is nothing we can do to stop it.  The point is that we shouldn't waste one day more pretending that the world will somehow become perfect.  

Millions of children are hungry, millions of patients haven't seen their doctor or undergone needed procedures.  Millions of children missed out on school.   It's time to get on with our lives and do everything possible to minimize the effect of the virus.  We need to control it, not let it control us."
2020-05-07 16:20:21,"My state is mere days away from a phased reopening. If all goes as planned, in only 2 months  social distancing will be “optional”. But already large  groups of young adults ( they appear to be in their 20s and 30s)  are gathering outside takeout places with no regard to social distancing. On Cinco de Mayo, they walked freely down sidewalks in many  areas I drove through.

 I assume the warmer weather has made them eager to escape the current restrictions. I understand this desire. We’re stir crazy too.

But we’re also greatly saddened by such disregard for the safety of the vulnerable population. When we were in our 20 s and 30s our parents   were  in their 60s and 70s. We wouldn’t have chanced exposing them. Social distancing would have been a small price to pay. 

And even if summer causes  this virus to recede , we’ll be wondering - as will our friends -  if and when it might reappear  during flu season. How quickly so many seem to be forgetting that this  virus needs only a small opportunity to gain a foothold and wreak havoc.  They may also be forgetting that  testing and contact tracing aren’t widespread enough to limit outbreaks."

For the 70+, we went from a generation of doers to a generation of goners in less than one President term."
2020-05-07 16:57:55,"Trump's message on COVID19, first and foremost, is not a message established from the truth, science, or regard for public health.  His message has been to minimize the seriousness its the public health issue and battle against public health expertise.   

To him, this is more of an economic issue that will hurt his chances for re-election--even if with premature reopening-- the virus will cause the death of hundreds of thousands of Americans.  That is why he called the virus the democrats' new hoax just two weeks before the WHO finally declared this a global pandemic emergency.  That is why in March and April--he was boasting about his polls and ratings. This is why he said, ""By doing all this testing, we make ourselves look bad,""-- what he means is that it makes him look bad, revealing his incompetence.  All of this, while the virus continues to ravage through our communities, killing thousands of Americans.  The United States already accounts for one out of every three COVID19 case, and one out of every four COVID19 death in the world.  

 His message to reopen the economy while death counts continue to climb is a message of the desperation of a president who has long rejected truth and science. The chickens have come home to roost, and sadly already 70,000 Americans have paid the ultimate price for his woeful ignorance."
2020-05-07 17:11:59,"In countries blessed with real leadership, opening back up includes a well resourced plan of testing, contact tracing, quarantine and economic support for individuals and small companies impacted by the shut down.
     Trump wants to kill the Affordable Care Act, pass out economic favors to cronies, and is so consumed with himself that 200,000 new infections per day, 3000 deaths per day are just the price of his chest thumping plan to get re-elected. Vote him out. Lock him up."
2020-05-07 15:55:52,"So the president wants things back to “normal”.   Only his version of it is not quite realistic.  There are good reasons to continue to heed the advice of the medical experts, contracting a fatal illness the primary one.
It is foolish to let someone who has not supported the efforts to contain it and provide adequate care, who says some of us warriors must be willing to forfeit our lives (not him, his family or his enablers, however) and injecting ourselves with bleach among other ridiculous schemes to cure it, direct our behavior.
I know there are some who will follow his words while he stays protected, but it looks like a solid majority are saying, “you first, Mr. President, if you stay healthy,  then maybe,”"
2020-05-07 16:03:45,"Trump's new response about the economy and rising death toll to virus,""It is what it is."" Proportional to US, South Korea has 1638 deaths to US 77,000(256 SK to 77,000 US, 51 million in SK, 327 million folks in US). Proportional to US, Germany has 28,700 deaths to US 77,000. Germany has 63 percent fewer deaths proportional. What is different? Testing, contact tracing and isolation. That's it, no complex science, just common sense containment of virus. Trump says he cares-baloney. He cares more about avoiding responsibility in responding to virus and placing blame. Like the wall he wants between US and Mexico, he has placed a figurative wall between himself and a robust, competent federal response to the virus. This virus for him has been a public relations nightmare. He wants it to go away so he can be re-elected. He doesn't care about the day-to-day grind of the office, and making decisions to help Americans. He craves the power and limelight just like on the Apprentice and his businesses. New polling shows 41% of US voters still with him. Apparently they only watch Fox News TV and radio. He says,""This country has to be run like a business."" No way, individuals, states, all of us have to work together not compete for every resource. Trump's path is more death and economic disaster. It is what it is because of his heartless, soulless selfish inept leadership. The US can be e pluribus unum, one from many, again. In September, all his faults will be brought to light."

2020-05-07 15:51:16,"The health and economic crisis we face today stems not so much from the coronavirus as from the cataclysmic failure of the Trump administration to lead this country in a comprehensive, coordinated and brave response. Yes we all must sacrifice. But the sacrifice is about working together to manufacture and distribute PPE to the residents of this country, to test and identify who is infected and who may have antibodies, to agree to quarantines of the infected and contact trace, and so on. This is what a 21st Century intelligent nation would do, one based on science and public health (witness South Korea as but one example).

Instead, the Republican leadership talk about our sacrificing our health and lives so that the economy and our American way of life can survive. Well, that's an asinine false choice. We should sacrifice some of our conveniences, save the economy in the process, and yes, tens if not hundreds of thousands of lives. It really is not that complicated, It is difficult and takes leadership and unifying strategies to make it happen. 

And for God's sake man, Trump, wear a mask! Lead by example!"
2020-05-07 16:00:45,"A representative from the Administration commented yesterday that there was no sense of testing people as it would only show whether they had the virus today and not tomorrow.

Mapping the hot spots and eliminating the threat in this way is most effective."

For decades we have been spoiled by useless riches beyond our means while ignoring health care and education. The rich have gotten richer and the number of people at the poverty level and below have paid and suffered for their wealth. 

Trump’s rush to “open the economy” is purely politically an personally driven by his hunger for reelection. 

Meanwhile, we should listen to the experts and revisit how America fought its way back from the Great Depression. Our success demands not only intelligence and service to Americans from our elected leaders, but selfless and responsible action by all citizens as well. 

Do your part to stay safe and respect safety for those around you. And protect our elections as well as pray that they will safe from tampering and available to ALL voters."

2020-05-07 19:03:51,"I have no intention to go to any restaurants, to my gym, fly anywhere, make any big purchases. How in the world these science deniers think that economy will just pick up, so that they can prance with their Hummers, clenching their guns, and wave flags at any opportunity. Life as it was will not be back till we had a vaccine, except  perhaps for vivid Trump supporters. They will continue till the virus gets them. American exceptionalism doesn't work with cold facts.

You're hearing it from him in his statements over the last few days: it might be over 100,000 this summer, but hey, thanks to the great work of my administration, the total is only a small fraction of what it might have been.

2020-05-07 21:12:37,"This should be getting MUCH more attention:

“In a way, by doing all this testing we make ourselves look bad,” he said.

It's well known and documented that Trump's top priority in any situation are his own optics.  He just admitted that he wants less testing because he thinks it will make him look better.

Let that digest a bit. This man is a criminal and will do anything to get re-elected, even if that anything is letting a few hundred thousand extra people die in an attempt to improve his optics.

This is literally the most disgusting thing any US politician has ever done. How is this even possible?!  My blood is boiling."
2020-05-07 21:16:33,"So Trump has admitted that he thinks additional testing will make him look bad.  Certainly would explain his refusal to use the War Powers Act to ensure the supply chains needed to have that testing in place.  Explains why he wants to make testing a state by state issue.  Explains why Jared and FEMA are intercepting supplies intended for blue states.  All of this lies and failures to act regarding testing are now perfectly explained; it's part of his re-election strategy.

How can this not be criminal?"
2020-05-07 21:06:14,"I guess that some people simply don't get it. Covid-19 doesn't care if you are a ""liberal or conservative."" Covid-19 will either make you, and everyone you contact (wife, family, friends, total strangers) either sick or kill you.

If - during the first week of the shut down - that both State and Federal governments had made good and managed to deposit relief money into the checking accounts of people there would not be this huge cry to ""open."" 

If the unemployment programs were geared to actually help people in need instead of treating applicants as lazy criminals there would be a significant drop in national anxiety. Instead, we citizens are given the horrible choice of ""work or death."" 

Now with more than 34 million unemployed, the plantation mentality of the, largely Republican power structure, has hit upon a plan to ""reopen"". After all if we are ""working"" then we don't need unemployment assistance, right?

I respectfully suggest that the real choice is to hold the Republican power structure responsible. - Hide = Life , Re-opening as Trump and his minions demand, puts yourself and thousands of others at risk. I am not going to trade my life, or the lives of my loved ones for a paycheck. 

Demand financial assistance that was promised. Fix NOW the broken unemployment system. With dollars in your checking account we can ride this out and keep ourselves safe."
2020-05-07 20:17:35,"There is a false dichotomy here between getting the economy going ahead and safety. The whole point of the ""shelter in place emergency"" was to give both public and private agencies time to understand the virus, adjust our policies, and figure out how to get things going again. Unfortunately, agencies that ought to be coordinating these efforts, like the CDC, FEMA, and OSHA, have been hampered by politics and political cronyism. We see these agencies fail to do their jobs: recommendations withheld, amateurs in charge of acquisitions, and a complete absence of new safety protocols to reflect the new reality. The reason we can't all go safely back to work is because of gross incompetence and mismanagement at the highest levels of government."
2020-05-07 21:28:35,"This is all about shirking responsibility. Now that a majority of governors has taken up the slack, ignored ""presidential"" lies, and moved to address the *national* problem, he can treat it like a personal debt and disavow responsibility. Moral bankruptcy, in this case, is not too different from the financial, a dispossession of resources."
2020-05-07 22:22:21,"Trump believes he loses unless the economy improves.  So no problem sacrificing a few hundred thousand lives to try to make it happen.

I for one actually agree that we can’t keep the country closed forever. But that means doing the hard work of testing and identifying those who have it and keeping them quarantined. The opposition to this is basically the incoherence from Trump. 

 It’s not worth bothering to argue anymore. There is no reason to them or their positions. If trump wins re-election we need to seriously consider whether a union even the cultists don’t seem to want is worth preserving."

From the beginning the death toll and infection rate was expected to be much higher than it really was, and now it is getting close to time start reopening. I agree with anyone who thinks COVID-19 is bad and needs to be dealt with seriously, and I would say it has been. But at some point we all have to recognize that there will always be threats to our society, and we cannot just hide because of them, instead we have to take reasonable measures without infringing on our essential freedoms and liberties. As Benjamin Franklin once said ""Those who give up essential Liberty, for a little temporary safety, deserve neither Liberty nor safety."" 

Also I will say that I think a lot of the anti-lockdown protests are rather foolish ideas. BUT that does not mean that some of the ideas of the protestors are wrong, since in all honesty it is time to reopen America. 

9/11 had a huge impact on the United States, and we implemented a lot of changes to improve our national security. But eventually planes flew again and people travelled, albeit more carefully, but they still did it."

Trump's small band of crazed followers took to the American streets in arms and masks in the middle of a global pandemic. 

The president finds no problem with direct violations of health and safety orders or intimidations of politicians and ordinary citizens. 

The unemployment rate in Germany is 3.2%. Germany's population is about 25% of ours, but 10 times more people have died in the US from COVID-19 than Germany.

In the US unemployment it is over 22% based on labor force participation. 33 million people have filed, a number lowered by the inability of systems to take record applications.

No Jared, the economy will not be rockin' by the 3rd quarter. Trump has made a total and unmitigated disaster of his term in office.

From John Bolton's disbanding the CDC Global Pandemic Response Unit in 2018; to ending the PREDICT program for identifying global viruses in the same year; to failing to maintain or supplement the Strategic National Stockpile (""SNS"") when warned of the pandemic; for claiming the SNS was for the federal government instead of the 50 United States of America - the Trump Administration has failed at every turn.

I want to see Larry Hogan at Ocean City this weekend running a concession stand.  Actually, virus or not, it might be a good experience .  Our governor, who can't bring himself to order that masks be worn in supermarkets, can work as a checkout guy."

The medical experts, on whom this rag constantly harps we need to follow their advice, have recently been shown to be wrong about when the covid19 started to pass from human to human and when it may have arrived in Europe and the US.  This means their advice, when presented as to how we should be responding, was weeks late and totally useless.

We have a special thing in Chicago, among the small handful of places that still have a thriving independent scene, lost to many other American cities long ago to corporate interests. I cherish this, and it’s what eventually brought me back home after 6 years in New York City (though not before I fell in love with many of NYC's independent venues that served as my home away from home). 

These venues are not simply just for leisure—they serve as churches, safe spaces, community centers, cathartic psychological aids, and are part of the economic heartbeat of any neighborhood. They have a rich cultural history, some have been around for a century. This pandemic is scary enough without worrying we’re going to lose all of our sacred spaces at the end of it. I fear it is a loss among many that we will not be able to overcome.

2020-05-06 20:03:29,"It's a business.  Some people work in clubs for love of music.  To other people, its just money. 

I worked at the legendary Bottom Line on W. 4th Street in 1974, the summer I graduated from college. My first experience working in a  nightclub was there during Bruce Springsteen's multi-night stand in July '74, when he played early versions of ""Jungleland,""""Rosalita"" and ""Born To Run.""  I'd seen a lot of great bands including Bob Dylan and The Band, The Beatles (1965), The Rolling Stones, Jimi Hendrix and the Experience, The Grateful Dead, The Yardbirds, Van Morrison, Muddy Waters, Janis Joplin, The Who, Stevie Wonder, Led Zeppelin.  But I'd never seen anything as great as those nights in 1974 when Springsteen played the Bottom Line.  

Pandemonium.

The 2nd night of Springsteen's stand, I was in the  kitchen at the service bar setting up my tray when the owner came in.  He asked me ""What do you think of this guy?""  I said I was thunderstruck, had never seen such a powerful performer, this guy is one in a million, he's going to be a huge star.....  

The owner sneered at me and said ""When this gig is over, you'll never hear of Bruce Springsteen again.""

As Howlin' Wolf said ""The men don't know but little girls understand."""
2020-05-06 21:05:24,"Jazz and classical music is doomed. Starting in high school through grad school, I paid my way by playing in what were called ""horn bands"", Funk, soul,R and B, Jazz Rock, and, after synths replaced horn players in Anglo-American pop music, Salsa bands. All the time I still loved jazz and classical music the most, but playing in smaller venues, frat houses and even HS dances was my bread and butter. Where is today's Miles Davis and where is the next recording at the level of ""Britches"" brew.? In fact where is the next Frank Zappa?  We are not hearing much more than ""ear candy"" anymore."
2020-05-07 01:50:27,"A Manhattan club owners thoughts:
Thousands of unemployed jazz musicians,most all live by a thread.
Dozens of unemployed bartenders and personnel.
No income with rapidly accumulating debt.
No legal protection apart from the remote possibility of a natural disaster claim.
Apparently unsympathetic and/or landlord-biased commercial real estate law, promising no fast track legislation mandating extension or leniency guarantees for small cultural venues --many are actual or defacto non-profit-- to maintain their leases enduring this prolonged closure.
Unclear if any automatic extension may be applicable to commercial property taxes, which tenants pay proportionately.
Decision makers may not appreciate the extent to which such cultural venues define the character and attraction of NYC, for current and prospective residents as well as visitors.
If these issues are not swiftly addressed by government, the mortality rate for such venues will greatly exceed that faced by individuals. perhaps not essential, yet the essence of NYC will vanish. May 6, 2020 www.savethemusicnyc.org"
2020-05-07 02:08:00,"Contrary to some of these comments live music was thriving in many communities prior to Covid-19. There are amazing musicians touring these days with phenomenal live shows even in small cities, and record numbers of tickets were sold in 2019. If our live music venues turn into office buildings or Starbucks the whole neighborhood will suffer. Live venues bring a vibrancy to a neighborhood in a way little else can. The restaurants, bars, music and arts and lifestyle stores around live music venues always get a huge boost when there is a concert that day. The people who choose to reside in a specific neighborhood may move away without the culture that comes from a concert venue thriving in its midst. If nothing is done to save these venues our communities will feel their absence a lot more than if our music venues were just “glorified boozing holes for college kids”."
2020-05-07 02:54:07,"A typical night's pay in a bar in 1978 when I was 20 years old, was $100.
A typical night's pay in a bar in 2020 when I'm 63 years old is $100.

The value of $100 from 1978 to 2020 is $395.88. A difference of $295.88 over 42 years.
Nobody is paying anyone $395.88 to play in any local club I know of. Whole bands are not getting that much let alone one individual.
I made my living playing in clubs for years, but every year it got tougher and tougher. It's almost impossible these days."
2020-05-07 11:39:19,"Saw The Rollins Band at Club Baby Head in Providence, RI (‘92, I think.) The ceiling was filled with baby doll heads nailed in place. Very small room holding maybe 100-120 people on a block that had seen better days. Lifted off my feet a few times as the crowd moved and moshed. Hot, sweaty night and crowd. Loved every second of it. I was on call (2 pagers nestled in my back) and having the time of my life. These small club nights ... we were equals regardless of race, ethnicity, income or education. I remember each night like this. These memories I hold dear."
2020-05-07 12:23:18,"As a music fan and former concert promoter, this is obviously worrisome and troubling. First Avenue closing? Are you kidding? The place where all of the live concert parts of ""Purple Rain"" was filmed?

That said, it says something really sad about our country's political system that the only way independent venue owners see going forward to find some relief is to form a lobbying group. American politics is so completely broken, with money being one of the prime suspects behind our myriad failures -- even excluding Republicanism/Trumpism."
2020-05-07 13:36:41,"Cleveland has a long tradition of great, small clubs. I was able to see Miles Davis, Jeff Beck, Tom Rush, and too many great artists to name them all at The Jazz Temple, LaCave, The Smiling Dog, Farragher’s Back Room, Peabody’s, and more. All closed decades ago, as concerts moved to arena/stadium venues. That was a great loss. Today’s small clubs continue to be the breeding ground for local talent, some of which will go on to larger venues. Currently in Cleveland, we can only hope that clubs like The Beachland Ballroom and The Bop Stop will reopen to support local and touring musicians who are a vital part of the American music scene."
2020-05-07 16:16:07,"A great model for clubs to survive is turning them into nonprofits with as much volunteer staffing as possible - the benefits for volunteers are obvious.

Maybe it will be good for music to return to campfires and outdoor raves and keg and generator parties on cow fields. I love rock clubs though and will miss them. Maybe at least the few legacy clubs left ( Austin's Hole in the Wall comes to mind now that CB's is gone.) can get some government support but it does look bleak."
2020-05-07 17:50:02,"About 5 years back The Blind Boys of Alabama played a Christmas show at my favorite club, Cafe 9 in New Haven.  The 9 could uncomfortably hold 100 people.  We got to the club about 90 minutes before show time so we could get a seat at the bar, the place was empty except for the bartender, the four of us and The Blind Boys sitting at a table with their guitar player rehearsing the Christmas song they would play on stage.  We bought them a round, listened while they worked the harmonies and chatted a bit.  My best Christmas present in years."
2020-05-07 18:02:50,"I spent many a night at First Avenue / 7th Street Entry in the mid-80's.  Great local bands like the Replacements, Husker Du, Soul Asylum, Man-Sized Action. Tetes Noire, MoFos/Hypsterz.  Also fabulous indie bands from elsewhere: Ramones, PIL, R.E.M., U2,  Ramones, Black Flag.

These venues are a treasure and are familial for many people.  I hope they can find a way to survive."
2020-05-07 18:03:44,"As long as the buildings still stand when the crisis is over, the venues will come back, perhaps under different ownership sadly, but live music will never die."
2020-05-07 18:03:56,"As a performing musician and live music fan who was born and raised in NYC, I can not imagine living here without venues like Le Poisson Rouge, The Knitting Factory, Mercury Lounge, Bowery Ballroom, Elsewhere, Terraza 7, and so many others. Venues here have faced daunting challenges since long before the Covid crisis, and now I fear we are hurtling towards a city composed solely of Starbucks and Chase Bank ATM pavilions.

2020-05-07 18:24:07,"LONG before rock and later pop music forms, jazz was (and still is) dependent on small clubs. Over nearly a century, jazz has developed, grown, and mutated in both organized groups and ad hoc jam sessions, all in small clubs.  

Some major jazz musicians are lucky to have teaching gigs at universities with a jazz program, like Oberlin, North Texas, Western Michigan, the New England Conservatory, UCLA, and Berklee. Some have royalty income from compositions and recordings. The rest are really hurting now."

The govt should have put a moratorium on debt service, given everyone a monthly stipend to forestall some of massive dislocations on the way.

Rebuilding is going to be long, slow and difficult. I feel so bad for younger people.  Be brave."
2020-05-07 19:06:14,"I love First Avenue! 

I’ve been a long time patron since early 1990’s. Through the years I have seen so many amazing performances from new bands in the 7th Street Entry, dancing the night away in the main room, to celebrating the life of Prince outside the club with 10,000 other Minnesotans. 

Dayna and the First Avenue team are a beacon in our  society. Her team has transformed the music club into a multi-venue enterprise in the Twin Cities. Through their shared entrepreneurialism, our cities have a collection of venues and events that bolster arts, community and revenue to keep our cities strong. Independent venue owners are the spirit of their cities. 

Without their bold risk taking, we could have never lived in the same moments with great musicians like Prince, Hüsker Du, Bob Mould, Lizzo, Babes in Toyland and many others. 

Every star on the walls of First Avenue (the flagship venue) represents the unique collection of artist to walk her stage. That’s something to fight for."
2020-05-07 19:13:55,"It's not only rock history that is made in the venues but it is the essential testing ground for new music, ideas and a stage for competitive exposition. It is ground zero for trends like punk and grunge that need to take foot and launch or rap to express it's arrival."
2020-05-07 19:27:00,"The government should not provide aid to non-essential businesses such a music venue or cruise line etc.  There is not an unlimited supply of money.  Why do people not realize that.  Aid should be given for important things such as healthcare, schools, etc.  People need to adapt, a few less luxuries in life and life will still go on."
2020-05-07 20:00:57,"thanks for this thoughtful piece, i would like to add that jazz music and it's justly famous rooms will be equally affected by this unprecedented event"
2020-05-07 20:23:15,"Bottom Line, CBGB, Folk City, Kenny's Castaways, The Ritz, Roseland, 7th Avenue South, Sullivan Hall, Sweet Basil, Tonic, Village Gate, Wetlands.  

And this is only a VERY ""short list"" of the many rock and jazz venues we have lost in the past couple of decades.  And very few new venues have opened to take their place.

In addition to Folk City helping to launch such legendary artists as Bob Dylan and Simon & Garfunkel, CBGB gave us (among others) The Ramones, The Police, and Talking Heads.  And Wetlands gave us Joan Osborne, Gov't Mule, Spin Doctors and Blues Traveler, among others. 

So it is not simply about having venues where artists can play, it is about the fact that many of these venues helped create and germinate those artists."
2020-05-07 21:01:50,"Without the legacy of live music - every kind of American music - the USA itself would be bankrupt. Perhaps that's a figurative comment, but to discount the economic impact of music venues is also a grave mistake. 

In 2016 music in Austin TX contributed 1.4 billion dollars to the economy. I've lived in Austin for 38 years making a living playing music. As other comments point out, the bucks have gotten thinner for musicians. But we do have HAAM (medical help for musicians) and HOME (to help musicians over age 55 with housing costs) and other organizations, state and local, trying to help. There is increasing respect for the value of Austin's clubs and musicians.

In recent weeks the Austin City Council voted to provide a 1.5 million dollar disaster fund for the music industry. It's  a start.

I hope that the US evolves to honor an art form that has enriched the entire globe."

How the stock market continues its euphoric rebound is beyond imagination- there are simply no metrics that warrant having a market at near 24,000 when it first passed this milestone many analysts thought it was ready for a correction- this WITHOUT co-vid 19! Look at the degradation of the economy since- hospitality industry, travel industry, small businesses of every type, the medical system, food systems, rental markets, the list goes on... Something is pumping up wall street behind the scenes- the Fed prancing along with the banks for sure- but Wall Street is being manipulated by forces whose intent is like looking into a fun house mirror."

The patient is too badly wounded to be treated on the battlefield- and that’s the case for all combatants.

It’s time to withdraw to shelter and find a weapon that can disable the enemy. A truce with an agreement to jointly pursue a solution. A vaccine and a treatment.

2020-05-07 12:48:46,"First of all it is very telling how little attention is paid to this huge number of people who are surely struggling to keep the lights on and put food on the table. Even the Democrats don’t say much. Maybe we really have been an oligarchy where the worker bees are totally expendable. It is especially hard to see given how compartmentalized socioeconomic status has become town-by-town. We cannot see what suffering happens outside our bubbles.

Second, the stock market remains overvalued, buoyed by manipulation by Trump et al. This serves as a panacea for the middle class and clouds their vision as to how much of a nightmare the economic situation actually is.

Trump is desperate for reelection and is leading this country through a series of catastrophically poor decisions (all dependent on the magical thinking that some force of nature like the sun or mutation will put down the virus). The Doctors have been sidelined. His followers will foolishly lap this up and we will all ultimately pay for these mistakes with our health and  finances."

2020-05-07 13:54:35,"I think the mentality of the Government in this next phase of its efforts to deal with the dual disaster of pandemic and economic depression will be the following:
""When the people ask questions that are not in their best interest, they should be told to keep their minds on their labors. Leave matters of the State to the State.""
Example to support my theory: Arizona Governor Doug Ducey is attempting to shut down infection/death estimate projections  by ASU and UofA epidemiologists that is not in line with his desire to let the economy rip. Those projections contradict Federal estimates. So instead of asking for the proper science/business based approach of asking everyone making estimates to get together and reconcile the differences. What was it Edward Demming said. ""In god we trust, all others bring data"". 
But that is too big a risk to take and could interfere with the Governor's ""Story"". 
Question: How is China's suppression of facts more vile then America's suppression of facts?
 
P.S. ASU just statement released statement saying they will continue to do their research and release these findings to the public.
I see the Governor proposing major funding cuts in ASU's future for having the gall to do fact/data based research."
2020-05-07 14:24:10,"For the past 3 ½ years, all I kept hearing from Trump was how great the economy was.  Wall Street stocks are up, unemployment at record lows and as Trump would say many, many people are working.  I could never understand how great the economy was when millions of Americans were working multiple jobs, living paycheck to paycheck including millions of businesses, lack of affordable health care or no health care at all, high costs of prescription drugs and education, dilapidated infrastructures, the list goes on. Yet in the midst of this crisis, Trump still focused on the economy, downplaying the virus and even calling it a hoax and totally unprepared for what was coming. Ironically, it took a virus to really show us how fragile and broken this great economy was."
2020-05-07 14:28:29,"This pandemic has shined a light on just how fragile our ""service economy"" was. The service economy has been devestated. There will be parts of the service economy that will simply be gone, perhaps never to return. This will result in very high long term unemployment.

We must begin planning on how to minimize the pain that is sure to follow. Failure to do so will drag the entire economy down for decades to follow."

2020-05-07 15:05:39,"One has to wonder if our leaders will look for a 'silver lining' in this pandemic as well as a way to simply recover.  When things are rebuilt after being destroyed to some degree, it seems somewhat backward to not refine the systems that failed and strengthen society.

Testing is the pivotal instrument in controlling any virus.  If the ability to test quickly and comprehensively is not developed and used here, this will all happen again and again.  It is all about the infrastructure.  Obama fell short in restocking reserves.  However, Trump went along with the empty shelves.  After three and a half years the empty shelves belong to Trump.  If America is not prepared for a second wave of virus, it will belong wholly to Trump."

It benefits the 1% and major corporations, and the money that goes into it our economy, while it looks very ""rich"" is by those who are in the markets and have RISK money that does not preclude their having all their needs plus more secured. 

Look at the unemployment numbers and then add another 10% who were unemployed, the 25% or more that were underemployed, and the economic picture of our country which was devastating BEFORE the crisis of this pandemic and the poor handling of it by the Trump administration.

But the pandemic has really thrown this into sharp relief.  33 million unemployed and the market goes up??  Once again, a Republican President has utterly crashed our economy, and it will up to the Democrat that follows to clean up his gigantic mess.

2020-05-07 23:09:29,"It is important for investors to realize that the circumstances of the 2008-2009 Crisis are quite different from today's crisis.

In the former: 

-housing prices in a bubble;

-underwriting standards were very poor - allowing teaser rates that presumed refinancing, and stated income applications;

-securitizations left originators with no skin in loan performance;

-bank asset quality and capital levels had deteriorated;

-aggregate private debt ratios reached dangerous levels.

All of those issues eventually cratered housing prices and caused massive losses for indivuals and banks, but could be addressed through monetary and fiscal measures and policy prescriptions.

Real interest rates were relatively high, so when the Federal Reserve Bank dropped such rates it allowed for consumer and corporate debt refinancing.

Quantitative easing (""QE"") involved the purchase of Treasuries and Agency debt. This allowed the Fed to lower long-term rates as well as short-term rates, and create reserves, which helped stabilize marketable securities and housing prices. 

Basel III liquidity and solvency rules were implemented to improve bank asset quality, make excess reserves from QE required reserves, essentially making the sovereign the source of liquidity rather than interbank activity.   

Presently, such direct fixes do not exist. There are macro policies that could be implemented to ease conditions, but without leadership from the administration they would fail.

How is that possible with economic hardship everywhere--tens of millions out of work and local businesses shuttered.

Easy.  Corporate America is taking over.  And I dread what this means for small business everywhere.

While local stores are shuttered, the parking lots of Walmarts, Targets, Lowes, and others are full.  And while small businesses that do not meet the definition of ""essential"" are closed, every aisle in the big box stores is open so those consumers for whom this pandemic is merely a distraction to their normal routine.  

And if that isn't enough, their on-line presence is allowing them to steal the market share of those who would during 'normal' times support the now shuttered local businesses.  

The bump in sales volume during this period will likely give them even greater buying power to squeeze those local business who do try to return even harder, making it even harder for them to survive.  

And we can't forget the huge advantage the pandemic has given online only businesses.  

Given the low or non-existent income tax revenue from most of these big corporations, how will these huge subsidies being made ever be repaid without fulfilling the GOP's long held desire to end Social Security and Medicare.

2020-05-06 18:37:56,"It's unfortunate that problems from unemployment will be amplified by a still-defective ACA.

One of the problems, ill-publicized, is that in many states, much ACA coverage isn't even insurance.

Specifically, the ACA expanded Medicaid, that covers perhaps half of people on the ACA, is, in at least 10 states (many of them blue like MA, MD, and NJ), for people 55 and over, subject to Medicaid estate recovery.

What this means is that peoples' medical bills are paid out for them now, but will be taken from their estates when they die.  This is really not what many expect--like many of us, they want to leave assets for their children.  So in those states, people 55 and older, who get expanded Medicaid (income to 138% of Fed. Pov. Lvl.) do not have insurance--they have a bomb in the form of only a loan until death for medical expenses.

This defect was publicized a bit in 2013 /2014, such as in The Atlantic, here: 

<a href=""https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2014/01/can-medicaid-really-come-after-you-house-when-you-die/357357"" target=""_blank"">https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2014/01/can-medicaid-really-come-after-you-house-when-you-die/357357</a>/ 

and, in fact certains states, like OR, WA, NY, VT, CA, and MN did fix their recovery laws to make all ACA coverage real insurance since 2013.  But many did not.

The problem could be fixed Federally, or statewise in the 10 states.  It should be done right now.

(For updates since 2104, see the Wikipedia article on Medicaid estate recovery.  Wikipedia is not, in itself, reliable, but sound references at the end of the article can be clicked on.)"

The second fact of life we're NOT preparing for is Trump's use of Martial Law to cancel the next election. Inciting riots amongst the ""reopen"" people, the white supremacists, and the radical anarchists, is part of the plan to stop the next election. Knowing that the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York is waiting for this worthless parasite to be out of office to launch a litany of prosecutions, Trump will resort to any action to keep himself out of court and, most likely, jail.

Trump has demonstrated utter disdain for the rule of law and 320 million Americans. This will not end peacefully."
2020-05-06 19:54:19,"The way to interpret today's economy is that there is ALWAYS a  tax-cutting, deregulatory Republican in charge every time this country's economy collapses.

The coronavirus is not Trump's fault, but his spectacular incompetence and negligence in reacting to it and mismanagement of it are Trump's fault, as are the reckless 0.1% welfare that he and the GOP caucus championed in 2017, and the historic defunding of the national treasury by the GOP since 1980 is the Republicans' fault.

Republicans are the worst governmental and economic managers in American history.

Nothing destroys American civilization like modern Republican greed and destruction."
2020-05-06 20:10:37,"The numbers below are from the Bureau of Labor Statistics report from March. For more info go to bls.gov and in the search box put 'Employment Situation Summary Table A' to see these numbers and so much more. Here is the big picture as of March.

The U.S. Population currently numbers 330,664,000.
The Civilian Noninstitutional Population, CNP, is 259,758,000.
The Civilian Labor Force, CLF, numbers 162,913,000 . 

The military and people aged 15 and younger are not included in the CLF.

The CLF is divided into two groups:
Employed: 155,772,000  
Unemployed: 7,141,000 

The Unemployed are people still actively looking for work.
Then we have people who are not actively looking for work. They are considered Not in Labor Force, NLF. The NLF currently numbers 96,845,000.

NLF + CLF = CNP

Here is the one formula you should know:

Unemployment Rate = (Unemployed / CLF) x 100
                                     = (7,140,000 / 162,913,000) x 100
                                     = 4.4%

2020-05-06 18:09:18,"“... two months ago, the [unemployment] rate was 3.5/%, a 50/year low.”

It might take another 50 years before we ever reach those figures. When more than 50-million workers lose their jobs in the space of about five minutes, there is no silver lining.

For all those 63-millions who thought of Donald Trump as an alpha-wolf type of business tycoon, how do you feel about him now? No; he is not to blame for the economic and social devastation that has now comfortably settled in for a long stay. But he was unfashionably late to this party. His lethargic, drip-drip response to the viral pandemic, a faceless entity that laughingly ignored him, set the stage for small businesses to slowly come apart and detach themselves from the market.

It’s now more than clear that small businesses drive this American economy. We’re essentially a take-out country and I don’t mean that facetiously. Wall Street exists for the ten percent only. This administration assured, contrary to the headlines, that neither stock buybacks nor CEO “compensation” would come at the expense of suddenly free-falling workers.

Donald Trump knew that he could run this life raft for big businesses through a sheepish Republican-majority Senate with oversight pared from the “care packages” as we have them now.

Perhaps his out-of-work MAGA nation loves him just the same. They’re nourished by his blind hate and his out-of-control incompetence.

Somewhere, Herbert Hoover is smiling broadly. He’s officially off the hook."
2020-05-06 18:10:58,"Thanks for this review of the pain that people are feeling with millions losing jobs.

Do you see the need now for getting money to those out of work? I hope so! Capitalism is showing one of its great weaknesses with this depression. First of all, why are we so concerned  FIRST AND MAINLY with the businesses and corporations from which the workers have had to be laid off? Trillions of dollars for the corporations hoping for trickle down benefits??? Never happens. We need a ""trickle up"" model by getting money to workers who will then, guaranteed, spend it on food and other necessities. Helping to save the businesses!
This should be done by universal minimum incomes to workers or everyone. Everyone's name is available somewhere (Social Security ?) and they should be paid monthly this basic income. This would replace the complex and inadequate Fed Reserve-Treasury attempts for the recent stimulus bills. 
Attempts at stimulus have been foolish, political, ideological, corrupt and very sad. 
Will America ever learn and become a decent place to live? I'm afraid not. Article here today about 20% of children in US not getting sufficient food!
Capitalism has failed and our political system has failed. I'm wondering if we will even come out of the current turmoil."

This would include schools, since state school funding will drop sharply and municipal tax revenues (often 60+ of school expenses are normally from local real estate tax) will drop severely.
This underscores the imperative for a Congessional bill for massive state and municiality funding. Otherwise, a countless number of health care workers, firemen, policemen, teachers, and other public employees will be fired."

And even if/when the crisis abates, lots of lost jobs will never come back. Fewer people will go to bars and restaurants, so staff will be greatly reduced. The same for retail. And travel will be limited to the well off. Offices will be less occupied, with many more people working at home on a permanent basis. Commercial real estate, mainly office and retail, will be crushed, as millions of square feet of space will be abandoned and leases not renewed. An option is converting unused office space to affordable residential apts. Healthcare folks should be given priority, and then those making less than $100 K.

2020-05-06 21:00:20,"We have virtually no social safety net; Clinton saw to that when he signed off on welfare reform in the late 1990s.  Our pay has not kept pace with the actual costs of living (barely living at that).  A great many people will die working because they cannot afford to retire.  Others will be forced to retire in poverty because social security doesn't cover enough and companies stopped pensions a long time ago and, last but not least, 401Ks are not a good way to save for retirement.  In other words, America has been laid waste, not because of the coronavirus but because of its own refusal to change its collective attitude on having and maintaining a first class social safety net for all.

The employment numbers haven't told the real story for a very long time.  Employers don't invest in their employees.  They fire and hire new ones instead of training their existing workforce.  Workers have no job protection.  Temporary jobs are not conducive to planning ahead.  And our wealth care system has failed miserably at keeping Americans healthy.  

Here's the question that our politicians really ought to be answering:  how  do they expect Americans to save for anything when they legislate in favor of their richest donors?  How do they expect Americans to remain healthy when we can't afford the monthly premiums?  And how do they expect us to work when companies refuse to hire us?"
2020-05-06 21:05:03,The jobs numbers will be terrible but once thing settle 80% will return to work almost immediately.  Trump will take credit of course. Worry about the remaining 20%.

Normally U6 is about 2X U3 and during the 2008 Crash it was over 15%.  I don't expect the difference to be as great as 2X given the huge influx of newly unemployed, but if U3 is 15% then U6 will probably be over 20%."

I am wondering what ""their jobs"" means? The exact jobs they were laid off from? Similar jobs? At the same pay with the same benefits?

People's debts and contractural expenses have stayed the same. The relief levels vary widely from state to state. And many have depleted everything they had waiting.

Republicans fret that relief will deter people from wanting to work. Maybe the people they know, their privileged political patrons used to skimming the cream. 

People want to work and pay their way and pay their fair share. The skewed GOP values, personified by 6 time bankrupt Trump who brags on being too smart to pay taxes, make people who want to do the right thing feel stupid. That and the specious up by your bootstraps mythology which pretends the deck isn't stacked for the Trump's and makes people feel guilty for not making it. And that's in normal times."

A few have received “confirmation” that they are eligible, but they are STILL awaiting the actual approval weeks and weeks later. My theory is that states are intentionally holding back unemployment until people give up or go back to work, which is why they are in a hurry to reopen so many states. 

But unemployment benefits are OUR taxpayer money. Unemployment is for the people! So, just like our current federal government that refuses to use taxpayer money to help ACTUAL taxpayers, we have governors (in mostly red states) withholding aid and services from their residents. Contrast this American response with EU nations that are paying basic incomes, salaries, providing aid and universal medical care.... America is behaving like a corrupt third world dictatorship."

These hardworking people want to return to work and get back their dignity.  Hopefully they will return soon and people will visit these establishments while practicing social distancing and wearing masks.  There but for the grace of God go I.

2020-05-06 21:48:40,"I suspect that while the April unemployment numbers will create astonishing headlines and click-bait articles, they really are relatively meaningless.  

The questions isn't how many jobs were ""lost"" in this first wave of lockdowns. It's to what degree there has been created a fundamental disruption that was long overdue?

Consider the simple fact that in the past several years, NYC alone saw the introduction of 65,000 Uber ""jobs"".  Something duplicated throughout both America and the world.

While such activities did produce some income for ""workers""; these were simple ""gig work"" positions.  In former days one would have called them ""temp jobs"" held by someone likely in a lifestyle transition.

To a great extent, these jobs are now gone and less likely to return so long as the overall economy remains in recession.

Add to this loss the fact that millions of people were employed, either full or part-time, in the retail sector -- and area of the economy that has questionable recovery prospects.

And the tech gig workers need to also re-evaluate their idea of ""career"".  Always a hit or miss career prospect they need only reflect on the number of graduating STEM students who will work cheaper simply to get a foot in the door.

Overall, whenever this economy ""re-opens"" it will do so in fits and starts and unevenly.  I would not expect a ""V""-shaped recovery in the job market simply because Trump and some primarily Republican governors say ""re-open now""."

Republicans are going to try to keep the U-3 number down for publicity reasons, especially in June reports and beyond. How?
The States will be forcing employers to call back workers,.... and if someone does not comply, they will be considered a ""quit"". Despite the obvious dangers of the virus.
Those people will not show up as U-3 unemployed. 
So, if you want to measure just how dire this ll will be, be sure to look at how many people are ""working"" versus how many are ""not working."" That will be sickening.

The mentality that gives dividends to shareholders, huge salaries, bonuses, golden parachutes, and other undeserved perks to CEOs, and denies workers basic rights and decent pay won't change because of this.  It could worsen if jobs are scarce because, in a self reinforcing circle people can't buy and the economy can't recover.  

All of this is why our vulture capitalist system has failed us.  It rewards cheating and extreme greed.  It lets employers force employees to work in dangerous situations with no protections, to hire temps to avoid the responsibility of training and investing in an employee.  Just in time works for some things in life.  It doesn't work when it comes to loyalty, planning for the future, or having a decent life.  

We need a new deal when it comes to employment.  We give the better part of our lives over to working.  Now would be an excellent time for states to create excellent job retraining programs, to tighten up regulations on who is an employee, and for that long delayed infrastructure program Trump promised us.

The business is simply a conduit for Federal relief dollars intended for employees. The program was never intended to support the non-payroll expenses of a small business. Continuing to pay employees even while business has dried up is what a business ha to do in order to comply with the PPP rules. Sitting on the money instead, leaves employees unemployed thus driving up the unemployment numbers. So, as much as anything, the unemployment rate rising is a product of ignorance and stupidity."

He's ""moving on"" because Covid-19 has him and his administration completely flummoxed.  They can do nothing, they're impotent.  Governors are calling the shots.

Trump state governors will collude with Trump to keep up the happy news.

The MSM has been reporting since March, every day, sometimes to the exclusion of all else, pandemic news.

The MSM is reporting things will be getting worse.

Will the MSM ""turn the corner"" now that Trump has and reduce pandemic coverage to some closing segment house keeping reminders?

2020-05-07 04:44:47,"Concerning unemployment rate complications, the author emphasizes influences for potential understatements to the measure without considering the historical changes per the CARES Act that have changed the eligibility parameters for unemployment insurance. Namely, the act expanded coverage to those with reduced hours (not in prior definitions of unemployment claims or rates), those in gig economy (ditto), and expansion to cover a longer period of eligibility (keeps more individuals in the pool longer, inflating unemploymenr rate).

In consideration of these changes, one can argue that there are also elements of overstating the unemployment rate (classically U3) against historical measures and that any comparison using recent data is not exactly the same and thus an inappropriate comparison against historical measures of unemployment rate."

My March forecast for UI and CPI were right on the mark, but my job losses were more than double the official number of 700K jobs lost, and FWIW, the program only allows for a maximum job loss of 10 million.
However, what did increase to make up the difference between my projections and the official numbers was a decrease in the ""participation rate.""  Basically, the BLS uses 260 million Americans as their baseline figure for the number of Americans who are actually ""participating"" in the economy, and as the article points outs, an employee is no longer participating if they have not sought work within the previous 4 weeks.  Based entirely on guesses I predicted a total of 3.3 million job losses, accompanied by an historic decrease in the participation rate.  My guesses are probably way off the mark, but my UI prediction is 6.8%, and an increase in CPI of .7%(how do figure CPI, when products people want are not available; also headline inflation weights food costs at approximately 15%, with 6% of that figure based on dining out.  
My basic point is, if through statistical manipulation the headline rate for UI is 6.8%, Trump will use that number to ""demonstrate"" his point that the ""shutdown"" isn't as bad as the media and economists claimed.  
Of course, I am probably way off."

Our daughter, R., is 36 1/2 weeks pregnant, due 5/28. We are very concerned for her safety and the newborn’s during labor, delivery, and post-partum/newborn nursery care.

Our grandson, R’s first child, will have his 3rd birthday on 5/18.  We have not seen him, R., or our SIL, in 6-7 weeks, even though they live in our town. I know that this is not comparable to the suffering of those with COVID, those who’ve lost their lives, their families, health care workers, first responders, essential workers, those who have serious financial struggles. 

But, this is our reality. When our grandson was born, we held him before he was an hour old. We don’t know when we’ll be able to see this grandchild. Becoming a grandparent is one of the great blessings of life. What happens during the first weeks of life is unique. You never get that experience with a newborn back. 

When our grandson was born, I spent the first week with R. every day from the morning through dinner preparation. Then, I’d leave so the young couple could have the evening together with their new baby.  I won’t be able to provide that support for R. this time. I’ll cook meals and leave them at her door. I’ll take the baby’s laundry to do at my home. But, it’s not the same.

It sits where it’s mate died and you can hear it cry. Sometimes they become so depressed that they will refuse to leave the the death spot and will allow themselves to starve to death.

Every day for 4 years my buddy ""Bum Wing"" (One of his wings always flapped slower than the other) was on his swing waiting for fresh sugar water (The Anna's hummingbirds are year round here in Oregon so the little fella never left).  I'd sit on the porch reading the news and he'd sit on his swing squawking and yelling at life in general.

A few weeks back I noticed the fella was having trouble flying and last Saturday he couldn't make it up to his swing.  He just sat on the porch rail directly below it and squawked at the rain for two hours.  He had a hard time getting to his feeder, drank and after a few false starts flew off, the last time I saw him.  I never thought I'd shed a tear for a wild bird, but here I am.

1 - They are Canada Geese (not 'Canadian');
2 - Canada Geese are protected by the North American Migratory Bird Treaty (Canada-Mexico-US) which has substantially increased their population over 1970s numbers (and why you can spot them from your apt. on Riverside Drive);
3 - They are highly adaptive and resident populations create aquatic and land problems as many colonies are no longer 'migratory' but 'residential;' and 
4 - Overpopulation is certainly a boon to fish and predatory bird populations.

One was eaten by the mother who needed the nutrition to stay on her nest during cold wet weather the other two  were terminally chilled by cold weather when the mother was driven off the nest by huger for one cold night.   

There were other complications.  The male falcon who would ordinarily feed the female and take his turn at brooding the eggs has been driven off the nest by a interloper male.  This is actually a sign of the success of reintroduction of the Peregrine to Massachusetts.  There is now competition for territories and the younger floater decided to fight for the female and the territory. 

Without the support of the either male bringing in prey the female was forced to abandon the eggs or starve.  So weather and competition has ended the hope for falcon chicks this year at UMA.

This mile long section is flat water and provides ample habitat. There are plenty of high perches along the banks that give a full view of the river (or as I call it the eagle feeder). Bald eagles take advantage of the food source and come swooping at eye level for a snack. I've watched them take adult mallards out of the water and up in the air only to have the mortally wounded struggling meal escape from 20 meters up then down in a splash. For the next length of time the eagle will wait out the duck and snag it for the trip back to its nest. Whoa be to the first clutches that hatch. It's danger from above.

2020-05-07 19:28:37,After obsessively following three goslings and their parents for the past two weeks I was overly devastated when there were only two babies yesterday. I found myself depressed and unable to sleep imagining how it was taken. It was with such relief to see this article today. Realizing that others during a pandemic have been equally obsessing about geese has helped.
2020-05-07 19:42:51,"We track the yearly duckling arrival at our small neighborhood pond. Ducklings disappear regularly via an osprey that shows up each spring as well as bullfrogs that sneak up underneath. 

It's a depressing cycle of joy then the inevitable tracking of the diminishing headcount, ""Down to 7. Now at 5. Only 3 left"" etc.  If a duckling can make it at least 3 weeks, they get too large to be picked off. 

The celebrity mother duck in local pond lore showed up about 3 years ago. She hid her ducklings in the reeds, we assumed, and didn't bring them out onto the pond until they were at least 2 weeks old. One day, a duck w/ nine large ducklings just showed up, and we were all astonished. All nine original ducklings made it as a result. Brilliant. We wondered what separated her from the lesser gene pool of her fellow ducks. 

It does provide food for thought when one celebrates the beauty of the osprey and the melodic bullfrog symphonies in the evenings until you realize the cruel reality that they also eat adorable ducklings. Nature isn't for the meek observer as this author aptly pointed out. 

Thanks for the great reflections and a story we can all relate to in one way or another."
2020-05-07 19:51:32,I work at the front desk of the Lab of Ornithology. My seasons were measured by the Canada Geese that frequent the Lab pond. The days are getting longer in late February and early March when I see couples walking on the ice checking their nesting sites.  By late March and early April the females are starting to settle onto their nest. The males would come for seed that I would throw out. Visitor always love seeing nesting geese and would ask when would the eggs hatch and I would say on or before Mother’s Day. Many time I was lucky to be at the Observatory window just when the goslings would be hatching...it’s a rhythm. Working from home I have felt off and it’s because I have lost my ring side seat to spring and new life.
2020-05-07 19:53:24,"Sandhill cranes appear to get alarmed and perhaps mournful.  One day, I saw a single juvenile crane walking around a 3 acre field making a definitely mournful cry.  After a bit the rest of the group found it and there was no more crying after that."
2020-05-07 19:56:53,"We witnessed two Canada geese goslings taken by snapping turtles last year.  Ultimately from a brood of 5 only 1 seemed to survive.  Such is the hard life of a gosling and its parents.  We named the last gosling Ryan.

I hope he made it and one day returns with his own brood. 

At least in the midst of this global pandemic, the migrating birds are returning, and they're putting on a great show right in our backyard."
2020-05-07 20:02:16,"Although I live in a city, in many ways, I'm a nature guy. We have a shack by a lake in Northern NJ and see all sorts of wildlife, bears, raccoons, a Bald Eagle last week, herons, falcons, you name it, they all seem to pass through. 

Yes there are geese and they are beautiful to watch. With that said, they seem to have no natural predators with the exception of cars. They multiply and dedicate to such an extent that they pollute lakes and streams as well as acres of land. I think we need a way to curtail the population to curb the health hazard they cause. 

Not only do they take over natural areas, on our way back into the city I see them on medians between busy highways, corporate properties and virtually everywhere. They are, for whatever reason, completely unafraid of cars and frequently get hit and cause accidents.

They are beautiful but not harmless. Some thought should be given to how to control the population. What's good for the human is good for the Goose."
2020-05-07 20:17:20,"A Canada goose pair and their seven goslings have practically been the center of our little world for the past several weeks.  All seven are still with their parents and we anxiously count them every day.  Last week we didn’t see them for four days and were very worried, then delighted and relieved when they reappeared. I’m so sorry that your goose family was not as lucky as ours."
2020-05-07 20:17:45,"The lake in our Georgia neighborhood has two pairs of Canadian Geese that each hatched 5-6 goslings. Their numbers have gradually decreases over the last few weeks, presumably to the benefit of the foxes, coyotes, and hawks that also live here. It seems sad, but if every pair of geese had 5-6 goslings grow up, exponential growth tells us that within a few years we would be awash in geese. And none of us want that!"
2020-05-07 20:17:54,"Late in the spring each year geese arrive at our pond.  I approach them and they fly away.  I walk back to the house disappointed.  But I am hopeful tomorrow will be different.  Then one day it is different!  “They” come, the pair that has come every spring for the past 4 years.  They don’t fly away.  Oh no, they come to me excitedly honking.  They accept a small treat and and move on to my neighbor’s much larger and safer pond and I know they will return in a few weeks with 6..its always 6 babies.  We will spend the summer together every single day.  The greatest show on earth, indeed."
2020-05-07 20:26:18,No goose problems in my garden pond. But I have a ménage a trois of ducks and I would sure like to know what keeps eating the fish in the pond.  We were wiped out (approx 25 goldfish) this past Fall.  Did not know I was running a sushi bar for critters.

They help us to momentarily forget about the virus. Please stay safe and healthy!
2020-05-07 20:38:35,"It's nice to know that someone else loves geese and finds humans a nuisance. The longer I live, the more I say to myself, ""what good is a human?"" I'm lucky, I know some very good humans, but the problem is that humans rarely lose their brood, there are too many of them, and they spread germs, havoc, war, and destroy other animals and the environment. As a species, humans aren't much good for the planet. Too bad there isn't some more humane way to make sure there aren't so many humans, but unfortunately, birth control for humans is voluntary. Geese Peace and other spay/neuter programs enforce birth control on geese, cats, and dogs, but how can we make humans stop breeding so much and making such a mess of the planet?"
2020-05-07 20:44:17,"This is a nice familiar essay. It is good for the rest of us to remember that even non-scientists who are deeply engaged with science make the mistake of viewing other inhabitants of the natural world as somehow placed there for human benefit. I might argue the point a bit further than Simpson, however, and point out that we don't even need to perform a sort of walk a mile in the penguin's shoes in order to understand what good is a penguin (or a goose, or marabou stork, for that matter). The thing that we forget about the earth as a macroecosystem is that the conditions that we as humans need to survive and enjoy being alive ourselves are constantly and consistently created by everything that lives on the planet now. You might ask, what good is a bacterium? And to answer that, I would simply point out that if you like breathing oxygenated air and eating food created by other organisms, then you simply can't live without the humble bacteria that populate the earth. Or the geese or the penguins or the methanogenic archaea &c &c."
2020-05-07 21:06:17,"I noticed the same thing in Vancouver. Last year, on Granville Island, there was a Canada goose pair that had 22 goslings trailing them. Yes, TWENTY TWO. A week ago, I went to Van Dusen garden, and there were at least 20 Canada goose adults laying on the grass. But only 5 goslings were visible. Immediately it looked strange to me, enough to comment aloud to my child. Where are all the goslings indeed? I suspect the raccoons, otters, and other birds are eating the goose eggs because there's a lot less human food waste lying around in alleys, public streets, etc. Now I know that the lack of goslings is a thing."
2020-05-07 21:19:14,"I lived on a pond with geese for 13 years.  Every spring many babies arrived. and every year the snapping turtles killed a few or all.  It was always sad to see their numbers decreasing by the day.  One year one baby was injured but survived.  He/she could not fly, so the parents hung around till the youngster could fly.  Weeks went by and winter was fast approaching.  Suddenly they were gone and I breathed a sigh of relief.  Fast forward to the spring.  3 geese arrived early before all the rest.  I believe they were still helping their child as this 3rd goose had a distinguished limp.  And for all my days I rejoiced at the sight of this trio, coming back year after year after.   Apparently they not only mate for life, but take care of their young as well, as long as needed.  Happy memories."
2020-05-07 21:25:55,"Wonderful article; thank you, Mr. Gorman. I too enjoy watching the geese at a pond near my house going about their business. I have seen a number of goslings in recent weeks. It is a hopeful and wonderful sight; it tells me that the world continues, despite what we humans are undergoing."
2020-05-07 21:38:59,"There is something going on. Gosling counts were down significantly in Canada over the past year or two. Someplace they go to count saw a drop from 3,000 to 30 from one year to the next. And usually they stop counting at 3,000, but the year they went back they could only find 30 to count. And NJ wildlife officials noted this survey in their recent decision to reduce goose bag limits for hunters. So, you know, we take our geese for granted, but they may be under stress of some kind."
2020-05-07 21:42:56,"I had the opposite experience last suumer. Two geese couples took up residence on a pond next to the main drag in my town.  I took my granddaughter to school next to the pond every day,and watched.  One group had four goslings, one had five.  I kept waiting for them to lose some on that busy busy road but somehow they never did.  There are more couples back at the pond this year, and we are ready to begin our anxious counting game."
2020-05-07 18:56:32,"I've been an animal lover my entire life. I make my living training dogs. I've come to hate Canadian geese. 

Twenty it thirty years ago the couple of dozen geese that occupied the local parks were, indeed, a delight. Today, with their numbers in the hundreds at the parks alone, they are a pestilence. They occupy every open green field and leave their droppings everywhere. On some days it is literally impossible to take a walk through the park without stepping in it.

Is there, finally, predator that is acting to keep the geese population under control? I can only hope so."
2020-05-07 20:40:35,"I would guess that the lost goslings were taken by snapping turtles.  

They swim underwater and take them from below, very, very quickly.  We actually observed that happen to duckings when anchored in Tar Cove in Maryland during our trip down the Intracostal waterway.  Very sad to watch.

I actually learned to speak a little duck language then.  
there is a particular quick repetitive quacking sound they make when there is food.  A duck and her goslings had come to our boat for some food.  I had nothing in the cockpit, so went below for some bread.  When I came back up the duck and her brood were headed away from us.  (So impatient!)  I made the 'food' quacking sound, and she immediately turned right on the spot and came back for the feast, her duckings each reversing course as she passed them.  Delightful.

2020-05-07 19:14:31,"Everyone knows that any affair with geese can only lead to sadness and disappointment. If you want relief from the sorrows of the day, you must find a family of turkeys, or, in a pinch, some ducks might work."

2020-05-07 21:33:49,"Keep hope, Mr. Gorman, as a friend was down by the Hudson below 72nd today and sent me a photo of a new family with nine goslings."
2020-05-07 18:38:20,"Yes, I know exactly what you're feeling, Mr. Gorman. I don't even like seeing one species of animal stalking and killing a member of another species on nature shows on TV. It comes down to this unavoidable fact: we all eat one another for sustenance --it's in our DNA (vegetarians excepted). The Peaceable Kingdom seems a distant dream."
2020-05-07 19:57:49,"Many species nest or give birth in my rural property. Last year a deer birthed a set of twins, which made the little family easy to recognize among the other deer. I watched those babies grow. It’s so easy to feel invested in the lives of creatures who share your home. 

A pair of Steller’s Jays built a nest in the arched structure at the entry to my courtyard, so the nest was about a foot above the head of anyone walking through. The jays had no fear of humans. I could even get up on a stepstool and look at the hatched babies. They nested there for a few years, but then one year my dog killed one of their fledglings, and the jays abandoned the nest. Animals being animals, I had to remind myself. 

Every year we see an explosion of quail babies. It’s amusing to watch the protective, fussy hens lead and herd long lines of silly chicks around the property. Then we notice the chick numbers declining. There is a reason quail produce such large clutches. They, like so many prey animals, are nature’s McDonalds. 

This is the ebb and flow of the natural world. While I mourn the deer of coyote lying dead in the road, killed by a speeding car, I don’t mourn the rabbit snagged by the hawk, or the deer killed by a puma. It’s normal.

I believe that geese do mourn their lost goslings. To think otherwise is arrogance. 

I say, “What good are humans?”. All we do is mess up the earth for other creatures."
2020-05-07 20:44:12,"The lake (well, pond) where I used to live in suburban Maryland was overrun with a particularly predatory species of black and yellow stripped turtles. One by one each April, the small flocks of goslings disappeared, snatched by a turtle. Neighborhood social media was full of stories.
    One spring day I saw one of three goslings at the edge of the lake pulled under. The mother (my  assumption - there were two inseparable parents), watching from slightly uphill, ran down to the lake then started pacing back and forth, eyes on the space where her baby went under. She waited maybe 20 seconds then began honking: honk, honk, and pause. Then she repeated the pattern. I think she was calling and waiting for a response. 
   Then she began honking without pause--a loud, frantic, horrible sound. At that point I yanked my dog’s leash and we walked away from the lake as fast as I could. I still heard her honk-wailing 5 minutes later when we arrived home. 
    So, yes, geese notice. And yes, they mourn."
2020-05-07 21:06:46,"Our backyard gets a lot of birds, including regular stops by hawks.  I once watched a coopers hawk jump down from the top of a fence into my perennial border and carefully stalk and kill a startling.  Sad for the starling, but amazing to watch.  Nature is not always kind."

2020-05-07 21:41:52,"I never saw many geese in S. California nor in Tennessee in the 60s, nor  in Oklahoma, but in Oregon and Washington I have. Ever since the 80s.

They were probably hunted in the South and Western S. California wasn't a great environment for them in. I have never traveled to the Central Valley in winter so I can't speak for that area.

However here in the Puget Sound area in Winter there are so many Canada Geese that it can be impossible to walk around a park. Goose feces everywhere. I've heard that this is true on Vancouver Island as well.

Plus I see swans and geese out in the farmer's fields in Winter here although some farmers don't like them while some are getting paid to let them feed. 

My guess is they're moving north with Climate Change. The web site for birds at the Cornell Lab has some interesting info on these birds. The ""Overhunting of muskrats and beavers may have harmed Trumpeter Swans, too: the swans nest on their dens and dams.""

I'm sure I'll miss those Canada Geese when they're gone. And they will be if we don't invest in rebuilding the country with renewables soon. The end of the lockdown has so many possibilities if we can turn the ship of state in a new direction."
2020-05-07 19:11:39,Plenty of goslings here on Long Island NY...
2020-05-07 21:22:01,"Around here, the geese have one major predator, except perhaps Turkey Vultures.

Its the Urbana Park District.  They hate geese. They tried sounders, blinking lights, fake predators, and then it became ovicide ... they coated the eggs with grease so the goslings inside suffocated. Goose abortion. 

They've decided that was not the best idea, since it did not reduce the adult population. Now they are thinking about killing the adults and feeding them to institutionalized humans! They are, of course, delicious. Use the recipe in Julia Child Vol. 1. (Recipe is illegal in California). 

The geese are harmless and entertaining. I've always been told that they are agressive, but they never once in thousands of
encounters have bothered me."

But the parents spotted me and my dog and quickly decided to depart into the depths of the river with those 6 tiny fuzz balls between them. I was devastated. I watched them carefully navigate their trip all the way across the river to the other side! A perilous first journey. Relief. Success. Amazing and beautiful. This is life. This is everything."

2020-05-07 16:56:01,"Canada Geese, migratory birds who no longer seem to migrate, have become a pestilence and, in some places, a major nuisance.  In addition to damaging the landscaping at many office and commercial locations, they can block access walkways, often challenging pedestrians entering or leaving buildings. In addition, they defecate all over the place, making walkways into virtual minefields. The writer apparently has never had a car bombed with goose fecal matter. Hard to clean, it often damages paint. That same material damages lawns, and, in the quantities left by a flock, can ruin years of effort. So write your paeans of praise about more worthy fowl, like swans, who are merely nasty."
2020-05-07 22:06:52,"Thank you for this lovely report. I miss the geese who live near a pond adjacent to my office building. I now content myself with the comings and goings of several bird families enjoying food I regularly provide, as well as two squirrels, who I have named Hamish and Suhaila. They dine at the picnic table feeder. Who knew the plague would force us to pay attention to creatures we usually ignore?"
2020-05-07 22:09:04,"I had to smile when I saw this article, as my husband and I are enjoying our neighborhood goslings and have made an activity of checking on some nearby nests to watch for the hatchlings.  Last year we discovered the goslings are green and fuzzy for a short while before their grey feathers come in. 
A few days ago at a local park, in a pond with a fountain, we came across goose parents with six young goslings sailing around the pond. The parents kept getting out of the water expecting their offspring to follow. But the water level was too low and they could not jump high enough to get out. My husband had the brilliant idea of building them a little staircase with some nearby rocks. Another man with his young daughter who witnessed the scene helped with building more staircases. Not long after, all of the goslings had made it up the rock stairs and out of the pond to reunite with their parents. The humans were cheering and crying, no doubt over the fact that we could help save something living during these difficult days."
2020-05-07 23:34:57,"I majored in population ecology at Cornell a half century ago. But you don't need any deep understanding or fancy math to understand that most years all the goslings will die. Turtles, hawks, foxes, and many others eat them. 
Papa Gander and Mother Goose are two birds, and they start reproducing their second year. . As the article says, they can live 25 years. Goose habitat is not expanding (in fact humans are reducing it, but let's assume it stays the same). So if the goose couple produces five goslings a year for 24 years, only two of the 120 (or two out of 60 if the adult geese live 13 years) can be expected to make it to adulthood. Sure, some couples might have a good year and rear several - but that just means more pairs rear none."
2020-05-08 00:42:21,"Thank you for this reality check. Oh my, when we really observe what goes on in nature, as so many of us are doing while we are keeping our distance from humans, we quickly see that it's a ""bird eat bird"" world... the singing Chickadees and Goldfinches at my feeder area are slugging it out now for territory. My favorite sign of spring when I was a child was the Red-winged Blackbird hanging on a reed in the local swamp - these days the male, recently arrived from a warmer clime, is a dominant aggressor at the feeder;  but it's been so cold, so I know he needs the extra food to hang in there this season. The blue jay- my champion! - was spotted today being chased by some screaming smaller birds - having robbed their nest. A lovely aviatrix of a Sharp-shinned Hawk navigates through the bordering thicket near the feeder like a guided missile, leaving feathers and fluff in her wake. As dusk approaches the birds retreat, in noisy protest, as a raccoon, and then a large rotund opossum, trundle into the seed territory. They are like vacuums, meticulously combing the ground for seeds the birds have left or missed. They keep a social distance from one another, ten feet or so. I can't bring myself to shoo them away, as I know that they are both most likely mothers, the opossum with hers, tiny and vulnerable, in her pouch as she slowly combs the grass, and the raccoon, in some neighboring tree or chimney."

At the time that we arrived we could order beer from one side of the bar and had to sit in that area - unless we ordered water or coffee in which case you could cross the line and sit on the other side of the split tables.

The town of Zug with a population of about 30000 in Switzerland has not a single Corona Virus infection and it is only 30 kilometers away from Zurich in the north and Lucerne in the south. The trains coming from Germany pass through it to go to Italy and vice versa. It is remarkable also because Switzerland as a whole was hit very badly by the infection. In 1982 I went to the family farm house, in Sankt Gallen on the border of Germany, of an office colleague for a weekend. It was winter my friend told me that the border is boundary of her farm. With snow covering the forest at the end of their farm it took us about an hour to find a stone pillar marking the border. The family did their shopping in Switzerland and Germany. Though Swiss don't like to join the European Union including this friend's family, they have no problem in crossing the border to shop when it is cheaper there. Those countries that are in Europe would remain in Europe despite the temporary rise of anti-European wave. UK was never fully in Europe anyway."

How is it possible to achieve economic integration without political integration? Will there be more countries like Britain opting out? Is autocratic rule like Orban's an aberration or a trend? 
The reaction of EU states towards Spain and Italy has been shameful. In comparison, there was more cooperation between the East African countries."
2020-05-06 17:03:52,"Liverpool fans will have an axe to grind with the bottom 6 for decades to come if the season isn’t finished, and especially if it were to be declared void! I hope they get this sorted out."
2020-05-06 17:32:06,"This discussion betrays an American level of failure, indifference, and arrogance. The U.K. just surpassed 30,000 coronavirus deaths. It has more deaths now than Italy and Spain, despite having had the horrific experiences of Italy and Spain to serve as a warning well ahead of time of what was headed their way.

It would be remarkably out of touch for the EPL to resume play while people across the U.K. are still having to shelter in place. (And if Boris Johnson is going to reverse that order Sunday, he's even more delusional than I'd thought.) It sends the message there's one set of rules if you're a big-time footballer, and another set of rules if you're everyone else.

Contrast that with the Bundesliga, which is planning to resume play later this month thanks to Germany's success getting the virus under control."
2020-05-06 23:45:46,"Two thoughts if the season is (unfortunately) cancelled, one of which is team specific and the other is league specific:

1)  Liverpool should be declared champions. The only team that can catch Liverpool is City, but even if they win ALL of their remaining matches (which is not unprecedented, but 10 straight wins is statistically unlikely), then City would have 87 points. So Liverpool needs only 6 points out of 9 remaining matches to win the league (which is statistically likely). Before COVID-19, several bookies stopped taking bets on what club would be league champion because the odds were so insanely in LFCs favor. Basically, the ""what if"" scenarios are slim.  The bigger issue is for the Champions League qualification!  While it would be an anti-climatic end to an tremendous season for Liverpool, they should be champions.  

2)  Aside from the Champions League issue, which is really a top 5 conundrum this year because City has been banned, subject to appeal, from the 2021 CL tournament, the easy solution if the league is cancelled seems to be (as previously discussed in the U.K. papers, ) NOT to relegate any team this year such that 20 teams remain for the next season and then joined by the top 2 teams in the Championship for a 22 team Premier League.  It would be mad!  In the 2020-2021 season, there would be 5 teams subject to relegation and the odds for promotion for the remaining 22 teams in the Championship would be better then they have been in years."

2020-05-07 03:45:14,"It's my experience, when talking about soccer to Americans genuinely interested in learning about the structure of league play in England, that they have no concept of the principle of promotion and relegation. The financial divide between the Premier League and the Championship is so vast that the play-off game for the third promotion spot to the Premier League is said to be the most financially important sporting event in the world.
It should be no surprise that the clubs facing relegation as the season waits in limbo should be massively invested in a resolution that does not damage their chances of survival. It so happens that there are six of them, but even if they signed a compact in blood to prevent the season from being completed with the final games played on neutral grounds, the remaining 14 would have the votes to force the issue. Talk of consensus is meaningless, as is the expectation that any business would not try to protect their own self-interest. In disclosure of my own self interest, I'm a Brighton fan, one of the six at the bottom. Looking at their remaining fixtures, I'd have to confess that their chances of survival are very slim, even if they played all their final games at home."

(1) There is a fundamental difference in data gathering among states, and looking at the time period you’ve chosen is data mining. You highlight CT’s underreporting. I would be curious if the DHS in NY is also scrambling more than usual to count deaths, and we’re just seeing a shift in timing to the highlighted period. What about overall deaths through today versus counts at this point in years past across all states and countrywide? If this value is flat, which it appears to be in many states, then we need to think about why.

I've raised these questions, respectfully, with a couple of FB friends who are diehard Trump supporters and believe every bit of fake news put out by his media enablers.

2020-05-06 13:00:39,"The likelihood of the EU's ""worst"" depression will serve as an inflection point to see if and how The Union survives.

The history of economic dislocation in Europe is not encouraging.  One need only to look at what happened in the early 20th C. in Germany post WWI as it faced both deep recession and runaway inflation.

Yet, it was from the ashes of the subsequent WWII that the Union first came into being.  Starting as a simple international coal and steel industry union it has matured into a near continent-wide quasi-nation state.

If the EU is to survive this devastating economic depression on the heels of the pandemic it must quickly devise programs to both share the pain and share the solution.

Whether it's EU-wide ""Coronavirus Bonds"" or some other financial tool -- the strong EU members (i.e. Germany, Denmark etc.) must find the willingness to help the weaker members such as Italy.

Simply put, the EU cannot survive if it lets its weaker members shoulder the enormous financial burden individually.  It is incumbent, particularly upon Germany, together with France,  to accept that the burden will rest mostly on them even if the immediate benefit flows mainly to the south of Europe.

Angela Merkel has been a towering and impressive leader for her entire term.  Let her now crown her career by saving the EU.  Because, if for no other reason, saving the EU is ultimately critical to saving a modern, democratic Germany."

Of course, Donald Trump is consumed by one metric: the economy, a dynamic that he thinks is his most realistic route to re-election. Of the human toll that the coronavirus has taken on the citizens of this country, he couldn't be less concerned. His Republican phalanx on The Hill and in the various Red Statehouses continue to march, with Trump blindfolds tightly wrapped around their eyes, towards certain economic catastrophe.

There's no testing, tracing and tracking to speak of. The foolish president thinks that the warmer weather will banish this chemical enemy to the ether and we can all go back to ""Great America,"" the amusement park chain that is now shuttered. 

The president has given us a roller-coaster ride for the ages. Think of all those who either fell off the rides or those who are stuck on them.

War calls for an organized government-led, sacrifice-demanding response. Americans need to unite to stop the enemy, the virus. The front-line troops of this battle- the essential workers- are health professionals, grocery store clerks, delivery drivers, vital supply manufacturers, and food chain preservers. Scientists of all disciplines must be deployed in virus research- from diagnostics to vaccines. Much essential work is needed, and many are at home calling for income and work. Like recruiting soldiers for battle, the government should mobilize, help, and protect all of these essential workers. The virus knows no borders, so effective communication with other nations is vital. Closing the border is no longer the solution- the virus is already here in droves. The economy will come back, but only when the healthy feel safe to go outside and spend.

It is disingenuous to say we have more deaths than those much smaller countries when by combining their numbers you get a relatively good look at our response’s effectiveness.  A serious and growing problem is that those in government are shielded from the economic impacts of their decisions.  They have their jobs. An economic depression sets young people (at least those not on government payrolls) back by a decade in building their lives.  It pushes children into poverty.  Hard decisions have to be made.

Testing now takes five minutes to determine positive and twelve minutes to determine negative.  The governments:  federal, state, and local should be funding testing if people are to safely get back to their lives.

It will take a school a few days to test a thousand students but those that enter the classrooms will be virus free.  Those found to have the virus go home and wait it out.  To take an airplane trip you must add two hours or more to your journey.  So what?  

Testing is the most specific and sure way to isolate and get rid of the virus.

To make matters worse, instead of surrounding himself with a competent staff capable of getting things done, he is surrounded by a cabal of squabbling lackeys. The man's first and only priority is inflating his ego to include an obsession with being reelected; without regard for the consequenses for the nation.

That the person saying it happens to be the POTUS makes it an open admission of ""reckless endangerment"" of workers and their patrons.  The irony couldn't be more starkly illustated as the photo indicates with Trump and his aides visiting a factory converted to making protective face masks where they are not wearing them, but the worker is. As the state-by-state data clearly show most of the states opening are still seeing an increase on Covid-19 cases and shouldn't be following Trump in endangering the lives of their citizens. It cruel; it's heartless; and it will prove fatal to many who venture out.  And what is the rush? It's all to serve Trump's narcissistic need to restore the economy by once again raining the Dow Jones Industrial Average to boost his fading re-election chance.

And even Democratic governments who everyone on the left loves nowadays (like Cuomo) have made horrific mistakes that led to more deaths (like releasing sick patients to nursing homes).  Even worse, folks on the right and left are choosing to view this problem through their own ideological lens, with the right ranting about ""Freedom"" and the left ranting about racial inequality -- neither approach is in the interest of all Ameircans."

Out of all this we will discover that our economies will not rebound for several years because economies take years to create and once you commit economic suicide it will take years to rebound. Just one example is myself. I own a royalty oil interest in a small oil field. As a result of our committing economic suicide oil prices went south and the field closed probably never to reopen because you do not just push a switch and all starts up again. The buyer of the oil has also gone bankrupt. So I will never recover and I believe my experience will play out all over the world.

2020-05-06 13:30:11,"We, as a species, have a stunning propensity for economic folly, building housing developments in flood plains, for example, and then hoping it never rains.

In 2008, the bank led economic crash was ameliorated by massive investment of public money into the banking system in order to shore up a “too big to fail” sector of the economy for which the description of cavalier is complimentary. Now, the banks have to repay that immense debt by lending freely, at fair interest, to shore up a besieged society which is far bigger and cannot fail. Debt relief and forgiveness would be a massive boon in that direction.

This projected depression need not happen, it is simply a question of doing everything that needs to be done to prevent it most of those being obvious. The great threat, however, is the rapacious potential for opportunism where dishonesty, ruthlessness, and bad faith combine to eke fortunes out of misfortune. 

Dreadful political leadership will do nothing to assist utopia in lieu of dystopia. It is unfathomable the American president accepts that people will die to protect an economy that was rigged to fail anyway. The vices of opportunism have already set the stage for the unnatural reaction to a natural disaster with its low paying, zero prospects, gig economy. 

We built this house on a global flood plain by giving the worst people in government and business the hammer and nails to frame it."
2020-05-06 13:31:02,"It is unfortunate that at a time in history when faced with a health crises and economic disaster the US lacks unifying leadership in DC.  Is it selfish to ask, where is our FDR, Truman or Churchill?  Instead of fireside chats we get commandeered medical equipment,  a push for more ""campaign rallies"", hype about TV ratings, misinformation about the disease and ""cures"", support for armed protests against the fed's own Task Force advisories, talk of letting states fail, and a rush to sacrifice our elderly and weaker citizens.  Our reaction to the virus and the state of our economy is only a symptom.  There is something else very wrong with America."
2020-05-06 13:36:03,"There are countries who have handled this crises well.  South Korea, Taiwan, and New Zealand have all done widespread testing, vigorous contact tracing and isolation of those infected until they are not infected any more.  Anything else is a recipe for continuing waves of infection.  Why is the US not following the path that obviously works the best?"
2020-05-06 13:38:26,"""Forecasts predict worst depression in Europe ever.""

The same thing is happening in the US, and virtually every country of the world.

The economic devastation is not for the most part the direct result of the virus, rather it is largely due to the draconian lockdowns imposed to ""flatten the curve.""  

The curve has been flattened.  But, the lockdowns do not allow immunity to develop; as they are gradually lifted, it is the unfortunate truth than the pandemic will continue; there will be more cases of Covid, and more deaths.

Importantly, indeed essentially, we must balance two bad outcomes: the worst depressions ever, with a bump in viral cases.  In all likelihood, the balance will involve testing, good medical care, and social distancing.  But we must also mitigate the lockdowns, and allow economic activity to resume.  If we don't, we can probably expect a cure that is worse than the disease."
2020-05-06 13:39:28,"Trump’s dismantling of the coronavirus task force and his admissions that people will be badly affected when they open the economy send one unmistakeable message to those really listening: American lives are disposable. Older people, people with vulnerabilities due to chronic health conditions, people with poor immune responses due to chemotherapy, and people with disabilities are worth nothing and must be sacrificed to his needs.  At the risk of hyperbole, I find Trump’s “logic” to be increasingly Hitlerian.  And to the think the Republican Party has the gall to call itself the “party of life.”

To those who say we need to get back to work, yes, we do. But, Trump has created a false premise of life versus work in order to hide his incompetence and lack of leadership. Had we done the competent thing, as NZ and Australia, have done, which was a stringent lockdown with scientifically sound testing and contact tracing, our economy would be in a position to begin a phased re-opening without mass casualties, as is now happening in those countries.

And I also want to thank Trump for his enormous bravery and thoughtfulness in sending the American people to the front as-yet unarmed and clueless.

Now they're condemning people who want to return to their jobs.  It never occurs to them that many of these people wouldn't be so desperate to return to work if their country had universal health care and a better social infrastructure for them.  And yes, it's easy for people who are lucky enough to work at home to judge these people.  

Far fewer Canadians are complaining about the lockdown, because they don't have to worry about health care, and, are receiving financial govt. assistance to offset employment income loss.

So one would like to believe that this pandemic would have been the wake-up call for Americans to understand how broken their country has become.  

But no, the Democratic Party delegates rejected Bernie Sanders and instead nominated another right-winger in Joe Biden who will not bring in the changes to make the country a better place for its most vulnerable residents.

The newspapers, of course, feed into this by making it sound like we're dropping like flies, almost gleefully tossing around apocalypse movie cliches (""We must be prepared to face a new reality""). Also, we're on the verge of economic collapse. And the murder hornets have arrived. Then, like an addled mother who hits her child and then says ""You poor thing, let me kiss it and make it better,"" warning that stress makes us all the more likely to catch a bug, they tell us of all the fun, cool things we can do online to while away the evidently expanding hours of quarantine.

Perhaps a better approach would be a more mature, objective approach. The numbers, while tragic, actually represent a small percentage of vulnerability. Expecting an entire population to remain in individual bubbles indefinitely is unrealistic and counterproductive. The failing economy, not to mention national morale, can only be helped by getting as many people back to work as possible. With a few simple common-sense modifications and precautions, a surprising number of people can be living their lives more or less normally now. Otherwise we run the risk of the doomsday predictions becoming self-fulfilling prophecies."

What was Trump’s point in doing that, or Peace’s appearance at the Mayo? Is Covid 19 not real or does it only affect rational, humane, people?

Trump accentuates disdain for a virus that will kill with increasing impunity the longer he struts in front of his base. It is clear that the only advantage that he held during his derelict administration was an apparently strong economy bequeathed to him by Obama. Now, even that is being shredded at a calamitous pace, hence the rush to reopen.

Even politically naïve Americans will come to learn that this presidency has been a sham, particularly as they bury family members at the rate of thousands per day. 

In November, everything so currently desolate about America could change for the better. Trump should be routed and his party made irrelevant by a resurgent public, ravaged by a contagion, chastened enough to know how it feels to be on the wrong end of a viral smart bomb wielded by an indiscriminate enemy.  America has killed, like a contagion, with impunity. Now, it is being killed. There is no poetic justice, just tears in the wake of global death.

Depression - Overwhelmed by bad press, Trump gives up his daily briefings.

7. Public transportation should be free until it is deeemed universally safe by the scientific community to reopen our economy."
2020-05-06 14:08:05,"In Booms and Depressions written in 1932, Irving Fisher quotes Bank of England Director Sir Josiah Stamp (1880 – 1941):

 “Money as a physical medium of exchange, made a diversified civilization possible. 

""And yet it is money, in its mechanical more than in in its spiritual effects, which may well, having brought us to the present level, actually destroy society.”"
2020-05-06 14:14:17,"Wait, wait! What happened? I just read that Trump was planning if the Coronavirus task should be phased out. Now I read that the task force will operate indefinitely. I wish that someone would read Trump’s mind so that the writers and critics can get the story straight."
2020-05-06 14:04:27,"I wish the government would just tell the truth for once.  And the truth is that in order to avoid economic ruin we have to re-open the country.  The other truth is that we could have been able to re-open the country (relatively) safely IF our country could mass produce masks for everyone to wear, and mass produce enough sanitizer for everyone to carry some around with them, and do wide scale testing and contact tracing.  The final truth is that our once great country can't do any of those things, so we are forced to re-open in an unsafe way.  Now there needs to be a reckoning to understand why the country that won WWII, sent a man to the moon and has the largest economy in the world can no longer mass produce simple products like masks, hand sanitizer and test kits."

To paraphrase, how can we spend so much on trying to support the companies which comprise our economy yet fall so short in spending on the equipment needed to protect against and fight the health effects of the virus.  Other than chucking a fortune at developing a possible vaccine and/or cure for the future we're just not funding enough that's needed in the here and now.  I know the question's really been floating out there but i thought what i caught today solidified it and put in proper perspective."
2020-05-06 14:09:12,Trump's decision to suppress the White House Task Force and then reverse his decision is emblematic of his poor leadership.  Why is anyone reporting on the President's activities or listening to him?  Trump is providing distraction not leadership.  Mitch McConnell and Lindsey Graham must be real proud of their unwavering support for this President.  This is the price of their grasp for power in the Senate.

Everything else is an artificial man made thing that can be made to do whatever we want it to do. 

All this economic pain is a choice made and inflicted on everyone else by the ruling classes. Most of their justification is the silent knowledge that they have to do this or admit their justifications for having imposed it on us for decades has always been false."
2020-05-06 14:08:23,"It is misleading to call it a recession when it is done on purpose for a good reason.

Recession usually means an economy is not functioning properly because it is disordered and needs fixing. It is a call to fix the problem that is causing the recession.

But here, the problem is a virus, and the economic shutdown is the fix. It is not failure to function, it is a choice. A good choice.

I'm surprised economic activity is not slowed even more than 7%, when so much is so deliberately shut down. But that is not a problem, it is a decision.

Now a problem is, Can it be reversed when we finally feel it is safe to go the other way?

If we find ourselves stalled in the downturn, unable to get it going again despite the efforts we try, then THAT would be a recession. That would be a warning to try more and better ideas."

Maybe this is nature's way of redressing the balance of life on Earth. We are an invasive species. Wherever we settle the environment is degraded. As we multiply and use up resources, other species are eradicated or displaced. If you believe in Darwinian theory, we could be on the cusp of being eradicated ourselves. 

It is our extreme misfortune as a country, to be currently in the clutches of an utterly inept GOP administration. It is being led by yet another one, in a long line of willfully, evidence-blind dullards, (Reagan, Bush Sr, Bush Jr, Trump);  whose lack of intellectual heft is astounding to behold.

If he bothered, he would realize that a majority of seniors will NOT be rushing out to dine or sit or shop in crowded venues where we are at higher risk.

Obviously, if there was a center of power which could bring all of the (IE) airlines together and decide upon a seating plan for all passengers on all airlines, we would have made progress sooner but progress is being made. 

NY Gov Cuomo's assemblage of 7 governors is another step forward. Obviously, 50 governors would be better, but 7 governors is better than zero.

Due to the haphazard, disjointed reopening procedures that vary by city versus by industry, an increase in deaths and hospitalizations is certain. This generation will needlessly suffer due to a process that elected a man with NO skills, NO formal training, NO empathy, and severe emotional problems.

But no, Trump continues to preside over a disjointed, misguided and negligent federal response to the pandemic. The lack of federal action on testing is unconscionable. The bidding war approach to medical equipment is unconscionable. The tweets supporting armed protesters in states with Democratic governors is unconscionable. The musings about disinfectants and light used internally to combat the virus are, well, not smart. 

I guess when Trump spoke yesterday about winding down the coronavirus task force he was being sarcastic, you know, to see what reporters would do."

Half this country is never going to wear a mask in public, or cooperate with contract tracing activities.  It's been 7 weeks of people cooped up in their homes and we're already losing our wits. We might as well initiate the Sweden strategy starting now, because we totally failed at executing the China one. And by now, the virus is so widespread across the states that we're never going to overcome the virus by avoidance.  Our best hope is the brave healthy people can us."

(4) Instances of young healthy people dying are horrible but still truly exceedingly rare: as of May 4 NYC death rate age 18-44 is 0.016%
(5) The spread is too advanced, the US government is too incompetent & mistrusted for contacting tracing at this point
(6) The economy isn't a just a fun game we play keep ourselves occupied. For better or worse it is the bedrock of society, and the necessity of it can't be wished away by people who want to hide under their beds for two years.

Or is Trump trying to set an example for the rest of us, those who might “be effected badly” by his policies?  Someone really needs to explain to him that the technical term for his “effected badly” is “die,” and then he might understand the consequences of ignoring and even muzzling medical experts in the face of a pandemic."

What matters is that he happens to be sitting in the Oval Office destroying everything that America has held dear with  his carelessness, arrogance, and ignorance.

A virus with an asymptomatic period of 5-7 days means transmission is assured despite best efforts. A vaccine likely will never come, according to the WHO, because of the mutations and structure of the virus itself. And anti-virals will never be a panacea.

President Trump, contradicting his comments from Tuesday, said the White House coronavirus task force would “continue on indefinitely,” though perhaps with different members.

His announcement, made on Twitter, came one day after Vice President Mike Pence, who has led the group for two months, said it would probably wrap up its work around the end of the May. “We will have something in a different form,” Mr. Trump later told reporters on Tuesday during a trip to Arizona.

Obvious Purpose of yet another flim flam exercise:  distract the press and steal press cycles on something that is not even credible... AGAIN.    And the press keeps falling for it.. over and over and over again... because they cannot resist the daily Trump false flags to the press."

2020-05-06 15:42:42,"Trump contradicts himself so often because his decision making process is too influenced by Tucker Carlson and Jared Kushner rather than the professionals in the fields that he should have as his advisors.  Regardless, all the recent developments are more and more worrying - that the task force will continue ""perhaps with different members"" (Sean Hannity, Laura Ingraham, Roger Stone no doubt), that Trump continues to believe we are ready to ""reopen"" and sees lives being lost as a result acceptable, that our President continues to think of his optimism for the months ahead a sign of success.

Otherwise allowing citizens and businesses to operate using sensible precautions with some obvious restrictions and scaled back operations. Where government could have been useful is in better protecting nursing home residents and in issuing limited stay at home orders for those sixty and older and those with certain medical conditions.

If COVID is no big deal, ""just like cold or flu,"" what is this revenge for? Do you get revenge on your co-workers for giving you the flu? The degree of cognitive dissonance is ridiculous.

When the virus refused to follow his orders he started an unsubtle campaign to fire one of the only people who can help us find our way out of this tragic disaster, Dr. Fauci.  When he reshuffles his ""Taskforce"" we can only pray Fauci and Brix will still be on it.  Worst of all is the stark revelation that he places a higher premium on opening the economy than saving human life, a great deal of human life.  His motives are entirely political. Despite poll after poll that finds the American people want the virus tamed before we lay ourselves open for second and third waves of mass death, Trump eggs on the tiny provocative minority that sides with his scheme.  These people are anti government fanatics who bring firearms into state capitals to threaten elected officials and show their true colors by carrying signs with swastikas and Confederate flags.

It isn't inadvertent. it isn't incompetence. It isn't a bug, it's the design. Some observers dismiss him as deranged and moronic. Too many made the mistake of underestimating him in 2016. He has a reptilian instinct for sensing where a strike will hurt the most, and then aiming for it. He is a lifelong career criminal and he should have landed in prison years ago. When you've been doing something for decades, you get good at it. That's what we're dealing with now.

- Gideon (D-ME)
- Bullock (D-MT)
- Bollier (D-KS)

""When Ebola broke out in West Africa in 2014, President Barack Obama recognized that responding to the outbreak overseas, while also protecting Americans at home, involved multiple U.S. government departments and agencies, none of which were speaking to one another. 

""Basically, the U.S. pandemic infrastructure was an enormous orchestra full of talented, egotistical players, each jockeying for solos and fame, refusing to rehearse, and demanding higher salaries—all without a conductor. 

""To bring order and harmony to the chaos, rein in the agency egos, and create a coherent multiagency response overseas and on the homefront, Obama anointed a former vice presidential staffer, Ronald Klain, as a sort of “epidemic czar” inside the White House, clearly stipulated the roles and budgets of various agencies, and placed incident commanders in charge in each Ebola-hit country and inside the United States. The orchestra may have still had its off-key instruments, but it played the same tune.

So...he has to keep the Covid Task Force in operation so he can monopolize the stage each day and go on and on and on and on with his inane proclamations, made up ""science"" and ridiculous advice that only the most educationally challenged would adopt....

In other words, the 6PM Trump Show has to go on. Rallies? Forget it. It's cute to wave flags and stomp around the capitol in your red state, but no one is dumb enough to stand jammed shoulder to shoulder in a hot, screaming crowd.

2020-05-06 16:30:11,"We know that the purpose of the government-ordered shutdown and “social distancing” is to (1) minimize the spread of the virus, and (2) keep our medical facilities from being overwhelmed with “spikes” in urgent COVID-19 cases. The purpose is not to eradicate the virus since that can only be achieved thru either a vaccine/cure or thru “herd immunity” – or acclimation of the virus throughout the population.  

However, we don’t live in a “medical vacuum”…which is how medical experts are trained to think. The devastating effects of a prolonged shutdown…in terms of our physical, mental, and economic well-being…can indeed be worse than the virus itself.  How to end the shutdown is not a simple “on/off” decision, but a multifaceted continuum based on location & data.  But even with this objective data, such a decision is inherently political because there will always be some tradeoff between absolute “medical safety"" (at least in theory) and the devastating consequences of isolation and a crashed economy.  

So until we find a vaccine, we must incrementally move forward with the economy while focusing on FDA approved remedies and hygienic interpersonal practices to mitigate the situation.  This process is already being implemented with guarded success in South Korea and elsewhere.  With proper care and due diligence, we can minimize the spread of COVID-19 within the framework of a healthy and vibrant U.S. economy. 

Frankly, and IMHO, there simply is no other alternative."

Everything Trump does is calculated, including not wearing a mask yesterday at a MASK making factory! He knows his base is watching and his message is “no virus to see here”. 

As the rest of the world takes it's first tentative steps to test the restrictions we have learned to accept, Trump forges your country toward a cliff. He is so done with this virus but it is certainly not done spreading and killing people across this world, including the United States.

He's an expert troll,  to the delight of his base, and we are chasing our tails by expecting him to execute duties of the office to which he got himself elected.

2020-05-06 16:49:25,"Trump's survival strategy is probably rationale.  

The choice is between bad and worse: open the economy, tolerate a higher (but single digit) death rate; or maintain the lockdown, endure widespread unemployment and bankruptcy, and still lose maybe 1,000 lives per day.

Backlash to the ""return to normal"" approach will be diffuse and amenable to proven distractions: blame foreigners, blame the lack of a wall, insult rivals, blame opponents for dragging their heels or pessimism, and promise game-changing miracles.  Brags and insults seem to work all the time with some of the electorate.   This route gives Trump at least some chance of beating Biden.

On the other hand, heavy social distancing and serious unemployment is almost certain to cause angry grievances.  Many voters will see it as a choice between survival of the many versus mortality of a few.  The government is obviously not prepared to cover the costs or even fathom how to pay for them.  Voters' patience will fray and their eyes will glaze.

One can prescribe WWJD, but the crowds chose Barabbas."
2020-05-06 16:30:30,"We want to open up the country, but how  have things changed from late January when we should have been socially distancing?

Yes, we have more N95 masks and ventilators, but we now have many more people infected who are also carriers of Covid-19.

Logic dictates that Covid-19 will come back in force if we don't socially distance or quickly identify people who have the virus, including those that are asymptomatic, and isolate them. The only way to do that is massive testing and tracing. Rational people will not be inclined to associate with other people in the office or elsewhere unless they know they were tested within the last 2-3 days and the tests were very accurate (i.e. no false negatives).

Yes, it will be expensive, but there's a big return on that investment. It's how we will get back to work and not have a resurgence."

Some still believe that covid19 is nothing more than a bad flu, as our president dangerously claimed, and believe that the ""liberals"" are manipulating this covid19 event in order to strip us of our liberties. Some even worry that our country will become a left-leaning police state. This fear and belief in disinformation is dividing our country at a time when we need to come together.

Many of these FB users believe that maintaining their personal liberties is more important than risking the safety of others. They don't believe in personal sacrifice during this covid19 crisis. I would only ask them to realize that this is a global war, and that we need to sacrifice much, much less, and act less brave than the brave American civilians and soldiers of the American Revolution or WW2. We need to be a team, and temporarily follow necessary, but non-life-threatening measures to save our greatest liberty: Life."

2020-05-06 16:52:22,"Do not listen to people who try to shame you by saying you're ""giving in to fear."" Fear is there for a reason, fear is not an emotion you must automatically ignore or hide. 

Fear could keep you alive - or, even if you personally have little reason (or think you have little reason) to fear the virus, how about being afraid for other people, who ARE at risk from the virus and could catch it from you even if you have no symptoms?

Fear can be damaging, and it is a primitive emotion, but it is a SURVIVAL mechanism. No one should be ashamed of wanting to survive. A pandemic is, by definition, a global threat to survival. Fear is normal when survival is threatened, as in a pandemic, even for those who are personally at lesser risk.

It is a frightening time to be living.

And while all this is going on, our so-called leadership is pushing for the country to relax safety measures and open up the country, knowing there will be a tremendous increase in sickness and death.  The task force of scientists who advise the American people is being disbanded.  Oh - wait - no, they’re not.  That was yesterday’s decision.  It’s being changed today.

I watched the segment when Trump, based on a scientist's report, half-jokingly asked one of the Task Force's doctors whether any substance in the disinfectants could be utilized in developing a new treatment? To which the doctor gave a medically correct, clear response. This exchange has since been widely distorted by the liberal media, and it may, actually, have been these distorted reports that confused members of the public who did not watch the actual Task Force presentation.  The liberal media is hurting the country, by using this tragic pandemic to turn them against  President Trump.

It is that which involves personal experience - return to work, ending lockdown, etc. Trump knows full well that no matter how much the Dems will scream about 134,000 deaths and endless suffering, he will mention how quickly the economy got rolling again, and people were able to go back to work.

Trump likes the pageantry, status, and attention that comes with being President but he doesn’t want to actually do the job. Providing leadership, making decisions, and exercising authority would make him responsible for things. Responsibility brings accountability; one thing Trump cannot stand."

WASHINGTON — Rick Bright, the ousted head of the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, has filed a formal whistleblower complaint alleging he was involuntarily transferred to a lower position at the National Institutes of Health because he raised concerns about the Trump administration’s Covid-19 response and about nepotism in the Department of Health and Human Services.

Among the most explosive accusations: Bright’s complaint alleges he was pressured by HHS Secretary Alex Azar to allow the distribution of hydroxychloroquine, a malaria drug, unproven as a Covid-19 treatment that has nevertheless been championed by President Trump. According to the complaint, Bright worked “frantically,” alongside top Food and Drug Administration official Janet Woodcock, to resist a plan to distribute the drug widely.

Bright also alleges his decision to speak to a reporter about the dangers of hydroxychloroquine may have played a role in his ultimate ousting.

Research detects a more dangerous SARS-CoV-2 mutation

A new study published on the preprint server bioRxiv* in May 2020 reports the setting up of a system to help track new mutations in the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) that is behind the current COVID-19 pandemic. This will help analyze mutations to find and track the spread of those that are most likely to increase the pathogenicity of the virus, either by making it easier to transmit or by enhancing its resistance to treatment.

This and the risk of infecting elderly child caregivers were the primary reasons why we worried about schools closing in the first place. It's going to come down to a very stark and mean reality. Kids are not affected as much (yes, there are issues but anyone who has been following this pandemic should agree that kids are not affected anywhere near as much as other demographics) as older Americans by the virus but are by our response. The negative affects this will have during these crucial years of their lives will in many cases be permanent. Yes, seeing as I taught many students who already did not eat unless it was provided by the school, I anticipate that some children in this first world nation will die of starvation. 

So here is the blunt reality: we are putting the needs of the older generation over the needs of the younger. We have chosen which is more important: our elders mean more to us than our children. 

As this situation becomes more dire, that is the ugly reality of the path taken. Whether or not we want to think of it in that light is irrelevant. It is something of which we will bear the responsibility for a very long time.

When I read this article, I recall reading an article on the ""Feeding America"" website that stated in 2017, 41 million people struggled with hunger in this country. The USDA defines ""food insecurity"" as the lack of access, at times, to enough food for all household members. In 2017, an estimated 15 million households were food insecure.

That was in 2017.  Now in 2020, with 23 million unemployment claims being filed, the lack of food because of the lack of income is reaching epidemic proportions.

What I don't understand is why the federal government did not pay farmers for the milk, eggs and produce they were unable to sell to restaurants, schools, and other food entities because of the untold number of closures.  These products were pitched and NO ONE benefited from that insane loss.  

Perhaps instead of the airline industry getting bailed out with $50 billion chunk of the cash, farmers could have been paid for their dairy and produce products which in turn could have been given to various food banks and depositories throughout the country.  At least everyone would have ""won"" in that scenario.

One of the children in my class lived in very poor circumstances.  The first day of school,  I sat with them at lunch and saw, in horror, that one of the students placed a buttered corn cob into his pocket.  When I asked why, he said it was for his dinner that evening.  The next day, I brought in a large box of sandwich bags and advised the children about which foods can be kept safely without refrigeration. When I purchased my own lunch, the cafeteria servers generously gave me additional rolls, biscuits, cookies...whatever was on the menu.  When we ate our lunches together, I provided bags for every student who wanted a ""snack for later,"" and I gave my extra rolls or cookies to the child who was never fed dinner at home.  Eventually, other students became aware of their classmate's dire poverty and shared non-perishable items with him.

Such is the extent of poverty in the wealthiest country in the world........  hunger and deprivation....

US universities are equally involved in this to manage lower paid workers to do mostly clerical and/or routine technical jobs that include teaching.

In most cases, this desire to get almost unlimited supply of far cheaper and more easily exploitable workers from abroad, almost exclusively from poorer developing countries including China and India, are branded as talent shortage by these organizations while the reality is they refuse to pay market wages or promote talent in any way. 

That hurt both USA (by lowering wages and employment for local people) and the source countries like China/India (discouraging real talens and promoting corruption there,  where foreign posting/job mostly go to those who are well connected and not those who are most qualified/talented.)

60% of H-1B positions certified by DOL are assigned wage levels well below the local median wage for the occupation.

B) The United States is a failed third-world state. We are a banana republic. 

Which one is it?

===
Sadly, I fear that the answer is ""B"". The COVID-19 crisis has laid bare all of the shortcomings of our once great nation. 

What is wrong with us?

We bought time over the last six weeks through shelter-in-place policies to develop testing on demand and contact tracing. Yet we are no closer to being ready to reopen public interactions and the economy than we were in late March. We squandered this sacrifice.

We have not provided adequate PPE to our first responders and medical personnel, nor the resources they need.

Every other developed nation has managed to do the right thing, slow the spread of this virus, and move forward. Based on existing knowledge and technology. The United States leads the world in COVID-19 cases and deaths.

Shame on us - and the complete and utter lack of leadership, especially at the federal level. We are lost as a nation.

We have citizens waiting in lines in their vehicles for food. The majority of public school children are dependent upon the state for daily meals. Our agricultural supply chain is dependent upon workers on the margins of society, many of them illegal immigrants, who live in cramped housing and rely on cramped transportation to get to work, and are thus susceptible to COVID-19. 

Our grandparents united to win WWII."

It's hard to refute the argument that American culture is a culture of evil, in which evil people constitute a substantial percentage of the population, and that this cohort now controls the reins of power. It's nonsense to claim that this lot doesn't see it that way; it's adherents are unapologetic.

Whether they are the powerful, engaged in profiteering and inflicting despair, or they're the ""masses,"" brainwashed by propaganda, is immaterial: they believe it's ok (""natural"") for children to go without food, for hundreds of thousands to die, for the poor, the elderly, women, children and men (everyone) to be on their own, and for society to be profoundly inhumane.

Charlie Warzel's op-ed today comparing America's response to COVID-19 to our response to gun violence unfortunately captures American culture, speculating on the ramifications. 

At its heart, America is an abusive culture. Like abusers, Americans will only change when take responsibility for our abuse of each other, that is, when we are motivated. Who will hammer that message home, every day, besides the Fourth Estate? Who will organize Americans to implement a New Order of the Age?"
2020-05-06 18:38:06,"For many years, American-style capitalism was trumpeted as the best economic system there must be. The evidence? It's better than Soviet-style Communism. What a high bar to set for a country!

Interestingly, there are many things the US actually has in common with the USSR which some would prefer to overlook outright. These include:

1) a defence budget bloated out of proportion
2) a bureaucracy out of touch with challenges facing the common man
3) Exceedingly high debt owed by the government. The USSR owed heavy debts to banks especially in Western Europe. Meanwhile, trillions in US Treasury bills are held by China and Japan, who are financing excess American consumption.

May I also add that Soviet citizens, despite being materially poorer, probably had better job and income security. Homelessness was also uncommon in Communist countries because of deliberate government efforts. 

When you glorify any economic ideology, capitalism included, you lose the ability to see things as they are and recognise its downsides. This is exactly what has happened.

The problems the US and USSR have in common were/are the result of government indecisions and flawed priorities common to both, and were not just the result of their respective ideologies. The USSR broke up partly because it could not sustain an expensive war in Afghanistan (1979-89) without depleting its finances. America can spend $4.9 trillion since 2001 and has survived until now miraculously (thru sacrificing healthcare)."

The whole machine grinds to halt when its time to support Americans, even responsible, hard working, white ones because everybody knows if you give people money they'll stop working.  They always do that.  Its why we got $600 and a warning while the rich got $7 trillion and are in line for more.

Its why we'll come out of the coronavirus thing and fall into a long cycle of of massive personal debt, foreclosures and evictions, failing marriages, bankruptcies, violence and ill health.

But, he fired the team in 2016, and never even looked at the manual. Instead, he refused to listen to our intelligence services and public health experts, took no action for 3 months, refused the WHO's test kits, refused to allow the states and private labs to develop their own, and is now shunning their responsibility and making the states develop their own testing, or buy them from foreign countries.

The Trump Republicans love to criticize the ""global coastal elites"" for living in a theoretical bubble in an ivory tower. But they are the ones who are hopelessly wed to dogma, and refuse to face the facts in practice that are staring all of us in the face.

I work at a a major university. I know the difference between theory and practice. The smart academics always defer to evidence from practice, and adjust their theory and models, as necessary. The only people who blindly stick to theory, against all contrary evidence, are cult members, ideologues, and fools.

I can still remember going through lunch bags left in the cloak room after school, hoping to find something to eat.

Maybe one of the reasons why I have issues with food to this day is because of experiencing so many years when in grade school when I was hungry more often than my stomach was full.

There are a lot of complex and complicated problems we as a nation face.  But for crying out loud, something as simple and basic as providing enough food for those who cannot afford it should NEVER be on that ""to do list.""

This IS a fixable, heartbreaking and preventable problem that CAN be solved. 

If the airline industry can be given a $50 billion bailed out chunk of the cash, then why can't the federal government ensure that every food bank and depository be filled with nutritious food for anyone who cannot afford to purchase food on their own?

I'm talking about 401k, pensions, student loans, and an absence of poverty relief.

It's not like anyone set out to create this favoritism, it just happened as a matter of policy because young people have no voice.  They're unheard!  This is what happens through 'squeeky wheel' politics.  That's what we have: Squeeky Wheel Politics.  SWP.

There is an inherent balance between opening the economy and staying safe.  The people I see out in public are all following guidelines, so I think this is the best we can do to start reopening intelligently.

I think there's a very good reason we're not seeing largescale antibody tests right now, because the initial results showed a far lower death rate than we've been led to believe is occuring.

It doesn't mean we should sacrifice the old!  Of course not.  Help them.  Get them out of nursing homes and into solitary or semi-solicary quarantine, but with good outside communication.

Then advise retirees stay home as much as possible, and mandate employers that can accomodate work from home do so for anyone that wants it.

That's basically it in my view.

But as long as the GOP remains in power, and the 1 in 100,000 Americans that constitute their only real clients can feed their kids, then the party of ""compassionate conservatism"" couldn't care less.

Let's face it, if Sandy Hook couldn't move them, then rampant homelessness, and having 20% of this nations children going hungry every night surely won't.

So what can we do? Well, if you really want to end the hunger and homelessness of innocent children, the first step is to vote every Republican out of office. And then hold the Democrats feet to the fire.

There is simple no excuse for this kind of suffering to be perpetually visited upon the most vulnerable members of our society.

Perhaps the Times could do a few profiles of these poor kids, and show us just what their world looks and feels like? Maybe then, the harsh reality of their situation would start to sink into our collective conscience, and motivate us all to do more to alleviate their needless suffering.

We happily pay a local small farmer $5.00 a dozen for beautiful brown eggs from happy hens that get to scratch in the living dirt and eat bugs. The colour of the yolks changes with the season and in the dead of winter, the hens don’t lay at all. We save the egg shells and give them back to the farmer to feed back to the hens. It’s their calcium, after all. 

I’m not complaining. I’m happy to pay for eggs from happy hens and the hard-working farmer deserves a fair price. Battery hens have horrible lives but agribusiness prices for mass-produced food are artificially low. The difference is paid by the misery of farm animals, scorched, depleted soil and farm workers made sick by fertilizer chemicals. 

We should all be able to afford good food grown and produced by contented animals and farmers who care about micro organisms in the soil that chemical fertilizers kill. I know I am fortunate to pay $5.00 for a dozen eggs."

2020-05-06 21:52:28,"Let's start with the USPS mandate: It was formed with a very different directive than its private-sector competitors, such as FedEx Corp. and United Parcel Service Inc. Those two giant private shippers, along with a bevy of smaller ones, are for-profit companies that can charge whatever they believe the market will bear. The USPS, by contrast, is charged with delivering to every home and business in America, no matter how remote. And, they can only charge what Congress allows; increases require approval. It also has congressional pressure and oversight on where it must maintain postal offices. The USPS has been slowly closing sites where there is insufficient customer demand. But closing an obsolete or little-used facility invariably entails a battle with each representative, who in turn faces voter anger when the local post office is targeted for closing. FedEx or UPS can open or close locations at will.

Then there is the issue of pensions, which I will address in the next post."
2020-05-06 21:53:58,"Then there is the Postal Accountability and Enhancement Act of 2006 (PAEA), which some have taken to calling ""the most insane law"" ever passed by Congress. The law requires the Postal Service, which receives no taxpayer subsidies, to prefund its retirees' health benefits up to the year 2056. This is a $5 billion per year cost; it is a requirement that no other entity, private or public, has to make. If that doesn't meet the definition of insanity, I don't know what does. Without this obligation, the Post Office actually turns a profit. Some have called this a ""manufactured crisis."" It's also significant that lots of companies benefit from a burden that makes the USPS less competitive; these same companies might also would benefit from full USPS privatization, a goal that has been pushed by several conservative think tanks for years.

Paying retiree obligations isn't the issue here; rather, being singled out as the only company with a congressional requirement to fully fund those obligations is. It puts the USPS at a huge competitive disadvantage. Yes, a retirement crisis is brewing; most private-sector pensions are wildly underfunded. But the solution is to mandate that ALL companies cover a higher percentage of their future obligations -- not just one entity.

What about lobbying Congress for changes to these rules? Unlike private-sector entities, the Postal Service is barred from lobbying. Similar restrictions do not apply to FedEx or UPS or other carriers."

There are aspects of American culture that remain unfathomable to me. Such as: why do Americans live to work, while the rest of the world works to live? Does that high importance of work play a role in the opening of businesses at the cost of lives? Are the elderly so easily sacrificed because they are not working?

Here in Holland, there is a very small but growing group of people that follows Trump. For centuries Holland followed French fashion, nowadays it is the Americans. The group held demonstrations in The Hague two days ago: mounted police had to take action, arrests were made. So if I try to understand its attitudes, I now at least can talk in Dutch. I know someone here in Amsterdam that claims that Coved-19 is a hoax. But even Trump and Fox do not believe that anymore, do they? It is hard to tell, as they are talking rubbish all the time."

So Trump needs to listen to his own support group and forget the notion and the distractions that he causes by talking about the US Postal service.

He and his wife have four children, and he recently volunteered to me that even though they both are employed full time, most nights there is only enough dinner for the children.  I hear very hateful tones in posts, but these are hard working taxpayers who are doing everything right, and still go to bed hungry. The car repair man, whose name  I know but won't use, told me he will starve to death before he'll ever let a child go hungry.

If the Post Office collapses from this artificial fiscal requirement private interests will scoop up that business and mailing a letter will cost $20 dollars or as the libertarians enjoy saying ""whatever the market will bear"". The wages of those who work for the agency will be lowered to fast food employee levels and the quality of the worker will be rock bottom. If that occurs that Mother's Day card you are mailing out this week will cost $20 dollars and probably will not make it into mom's mailbox.

   The petitioners, a conservative political action committee and several businesses, told the justices that Gov. Tom Wolf's (D) executive order ""has and is continuing to cause irreparable harm.""
   The court’s denial of the request, issued without comment, means fewer than five of the nine justices supported the petition.""
   The outcome was unsurprising given the Supreme Court’s long recognition of broad government authority amid public health crises. Previously, the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania also denied the petitioners' request.
   Earlier this week, Pennsylvania's attorney general filed a 43-page response to the justices defending the legality of Wolf’s order and urging the high court not to intervene.
   “Applicants seek to upend the status quo and force Pennsylvania to prematurely reopen all business locations, regardless of public health data and contrary to the phased reopening currently underway based on that data,” the state’s attorney general Josh Shapiro wrote.

Otherwise, we're just subsidizing Amazon (which hardly needs taxpayer subsidies) and the wealthy people who shop there (their customers skew wealthier than average and it's the wealthy who are buying the most).

We are so glad we sold our house in AZ some years ago and bought a condo in LA instead.  Quite the opposite migration  of most retirees -- but there you have it.

Ducey's decision now to ignore expert data-driven advice during a pandemic is really quite par for the course in AZ.

As compared to climate change models, which make projections years out that are impossible to test, coronavirus models can be checked for performance very quickly and within weeks as in the British Medical Journal article.  

It is scary that so many also rely upon climate change models that have never had their day in the court of validation data."

2020-05-06 22:55:58,"The burden inflicted on this nation by having Donald Trump in the White House is too much -- even for many Republicans.

Trump rushes to disband the Covid-19 Task Force, blaming setbacks on Democratic officeholders and anyone else he can think of -- except, of course, himself. Now, hearing the anger in the country, Trump changes direction. Same task force, different players.

Donald Trump is so devious that, although he wants to close the United States Post Office to please Republican donors, who have been trying to do the same thing for years, he doesn't have the nerve to admit the real reason. So, instead, Trump brings up his feud with Jeff Bezos of Amazon, whose company has been essential to Americans in lockdown. 

Trump, who was a notoriously incompetent businessman and constantly needed bailouts from his father, resents the success of Bezos and the fact that another company Bezos owns -- The Washington Post -- is often critical of  Trump's presidency.

Donald Trump makes a mess of everything he touches, and a clear majority of Americans, desperately trying to survive a pandemic he has mismanaged, want Donald Trump out of the White House in January."

He already said publicly that if everyone does mail in votes, the Republicans will lose the election. Oh, and BTW, on his twitter feed he was declaring that mail in ballots would encourage voter fraud. This is not supported by any evidence, not even his own “voter fraud commission” that was disbanded because there was no evidence of anything after the 2016 election. BTW, there was never a final report from that commission, also led by Pence."

Similarly, John Ratcliffe, one of the most conservative (yet photogenic) members of Congress, is sailing to Senate confirmation as the latest Director of National Intelligence despite a hearing during which he lied through his teeth.

This is why the Senate was called back to DC despite the ongoing coronavirus risk. Not to investigate into whose deep pockets all that pandemic stimulus money disappeared to.

This is what is happening under the radar while everyone is focused on Trump's shenanigans and the staged reopening protests. The GOP has deftly pushed the carnival barker front and center while they loot the economy and undermine legal protections. And still we worry about whether Wendy's has run out of ground beef."

No amount of public proclamation can disguise the ineptitude of the abysmal economic policy response in this crisis.   This could have been handled with some expense, but comparative painless ease.

The only winners in this scenario are the private companies and ad agencies, at the expense of USPS (who will struggle financially again as soon as the money runs out unless something changes) and taxpayers (who keep funding ridiculously undeserved corporate bailouts). We should tax these massive private companies more.

It's unbelievable. Now Republicans claim their food subsidies to date are ""sufficient.""
How many of these farms are really owned by Big Ag companies here and abroad?  E.g., millions in Trump's so-called ""relief for farmers"" went to Trump cronies based in Brazil while American farmers got nothing.

The Republicans have been demonizing the Postal Service for decades.  The problem is that the shortcomings of the Postal Service are of Congress' own making with their disingenuous policies designed to make the Postal Service more ""entrepreneurial"" while actually erecting barriers to efficiency and profitability. The end goal, of course, is strangling the Postal Service to enable the private sector (read GOP donors) to profit at the taxpayer purse."

I remember eating school lunches myself in elementary school decades ago. My parents didn’t have any spare money but food was prioritized over everything else. However it seems like everyday the news has some terribly neglected children taken away from slovenly homes that have never even been to school. The parents had the money for drugs but not for food for the kids. We are also fighting a horrible war against addiction especially from opiates for the past several years too. That can’t be a coincidence. If these kids don’t get fed better future generations can succumb easier to diseases and lack capacity to thrive.

But this thing about killing the USPS in order to harm Amazon is beyond crazy. It’s not as if there aren’t alternative shipping services Amazon could utilize. Who knows, maybe Amazon could even start its own postal service. It has become increasingly clear that we have an overgrown toddler occupying the Oval Office.

I do wonder how much more we can take. We are easily heading toward 100,000 deaths all killed by the GOP and that's not enough as they call everyone not rich back to work. As they tell us to do something they're not doing. None of them asking about testing or vaccines. None requests waivers of medical treatment forms to be signed so that resources can be left for the responsible people. Just go jump off the cliff to make trump look good. To help his election.

And yes, it's easy for people who are lucky enough to work to judge these people.  

Far fewer Canadians are complaining about the lockdown, because they don't have to worry about health care, and, are receiving financial govt. assistance to offset employment income loss.

So one would like to believe that this pandemic would have been the wake-up call for Americans to understand how broken their country has become.  

But no, the Democratic Party delegates rejected Bernie Sanders and instead nominated another right-winger in Joe Biden who will not bring in the changes to make the country better a better place for its most vulnerable residents.

He had been Postmaster in Philadelphia and made certain that the US Post Office was written into the US Constitution at Article I, Section 8, Clause 7, the Postal Clause or the Postal Power. This empowers Congress ""To establish Post Offices and Post Roads"".

Hey Congress, you have the Constitutional authority to establish Post Offices.

I can’t handle the fact that Trump‘s incompetence created this second Great Depression and takes no responsibility for it whatsoever. I feel like Sally Field’s character in Steel Magnolias when Julia Roberts dies. I just want to hit something. Where is Mrs. Ouiser? I need to hit you, Shirley MacLaine.

I’m not yet old enough to wear funny hats and grow vegetables in the dirt, but that’s precisely what I’m doing to help this food crisis. I planted a ton of vegetables, and have absolutely no clue how to grow vegetables aside from what I’m learning on YouTube, but I’m trying.

2020-05-07 01:21:14,"The relief program for farmers could have included an expansion of the SNAP program as a market support for farm products. Such a relief program would have been a win-win for everyone. Unemployed parents with SNAP benefits would have been able purchase food for their kids, and farmers would have been able to earn an income from selling their essential agricultural products to Americans in need. This would have resulted in less wasted milk and crops, and less hunger. Also, the government could have immediately started to procure more essential PPE and viral test kits from Americans firms and put more unemployed Americans to work producing essential items that are still in short supply. Obviously, this would have reduced government payments of unemployment benefits. Similarly, unemployed people could have been put work in a government funded project to create essential COVID-19 vaccine manufacturing capacity in America. Such manufacturing capacity will be needed in the near future to supply an adequate amount of the COVID-19 vaccine for everyone. Imaginative solutions to America’s problems are possible, but these kinds of government supported solutions are not coming from President Trump and his advisers. In his response to the COVID-19 pandemic, President Trump is tolerating too much hunger and death in America."

2020-05-07 01:20:45,"The GOP move to shut down the postal service is fueled by TWO things: (1) The FACT that wealthy GOP corporate donors want to buy the remains of the USPS for little more than a song and operate it was a private company that charges exhorbitant rates for mail service.  (The USPS is not going bankrupt--it is being bankrupted by being the ONLY ""company"" in the world that is legally required to stockpile money to pay the retirement benefits of employees who havent been born yet.          <a href=""https://www.govexec.com/pay-benefits/2020/02/house-votes-end-controversial-usps-payments-future-retirees-health-care/162912"" target=""_blank"">https://www.govexec.com/pay-benefits/2020/02/house-votes-end-controversial-usps-payments-future-retirees-health-care/162912</a>/)

and (2) the GOP is DESPERATE to prevent balloting-by-mail at all costs.  If there is no USPS, the cost of mail in balloting becomes astronomical because UPS and FedEx rates to mail something like a single letter is about $12.  Compare that to the USPS rate for a First Class Letter of 55 CENTS.  The high cost under private services would be onerous to both governmental entities and taxpayers."
2020-05-07 01:20:52,"Let's say Trump can convince enough people to close the PO because he can't get the  rate increase. The slightly lower rate of the Post Office on some items is the way they appeal to shippers. The Post Office has consistently stated that they make money on package delivery. They lose money on letter delivery. So, what does Trump attack?

We will certainly need to have their services so, it would be put up for bid. Can you think of any corporation that has the money and the muscle to take it over? Oh yeah, that Amazon guy;

It would be good for the Country if Trump could learn to keep his personal battles personal.  But, he can't and he won't. If he wins this fight, as usual, he will have lost in the end because Amazon and all the other businesses that use the Post Office for package delivery are not going to absorb the increase. They are going to change their delivery company and/or pass on the added cost to the consumer. This is all the gift from that man who is making America great again."

They will go into bankruptcy themselves, decline medical care if they get sick and thus spread the virus farther, all continuing the downward spiral as their collective inability to pay their bills takes other businesses and jobs--and probably yours--with them. This is not the time to push privatization and shake up the postal service that has served this country perfectly well since Benjamin Franklin--who did actually make America great--started it.

Does anyone think this story was planted by a Trump supporter?

When Poland went capitalist, one of the first things that was done, was to shutdown the Gdansk shipyard, where the fight to go capitalist, started.

Suggested by Trump or not, the Post Office needs serious review.  It is too important an institution, to be left to vegetate in a lame state.

Let's have a real debate in congress - a non-partisan debate, that focuses on the issues, and not on Trump, who tends to poison every issue he gets involved in."

The result, economic devastation and unnecessary suffering and death on an unimaginable scale. I know that this would have been a bad situation even with President Obama in the White House and a democratically controlled Congress but I also know that the nation would have been far better off. I truly do not believe that the nation can afford four more years of this.￼￼￼￼ I’m not even certain that those truly in desperate need can survive several more months.￼"

The corona virus thrives on crowds, activity and movement from place to place. It wants the same thing capitalism and the economy want, but this virus is deadly. To stop it it has to be deprived of its means to spread. This deprivation, which is a boon to the natural world, means slowing down the economy, travel,movement, activity and crowding. Exactly what capitalism desires. 
We do not know how long this control has to last. Uncertainty is scary to the market. The edifice is cracking. 
We are seeing the fragility of the economic system and it is frightening. Everything depends on what spreads the virus. The system is unstable and cannot stand changes. Like a house of cards it tumbles. How can we stabilize our economic system? One good old idea is that we should not put all our eggs in one basket. Encourage small business, discourage giant and mega giant systems, which have oversized political influence and demand) support. Spread the load. Reduce the concentration. Reduce the huge crowds. spread the money out, and the influence. Make us able to buy local. make the base wider,more.stable, less concentrated and closer to home.

Further, another example of Trump's financial failure, is  his viewpoint against the US Postal Service, which he refuses to finance it,  because he wants to privatize it, and quadruple its rates.  

In fact, our Constitution specifically provides for our postal service when our country was founded.  And we, the ordinary 320 million+ of us who are not millionaires and billionaires, need it at affordable rates, including and especially for the receipt of meds.

Trump and the GOP are the exact opposite, opportunistic, self-serving, money-grubbing hypocrites who figured out how to wage propaganda wars to co-opt, as voters, the very people they fail to serve. 
 
This administration not only eradicated its NSC Pandemic Response Team, ignoring the results of Ebola and Contagious Crimson, it cannot even provide the PPE and viral testing necessary to realize the kinds of achievements made in Germany and Hong Kong during the Pandemic.  Nevertheless, Trump wants to show how great he is by prematurely dropping the Pandemic precautions.

Trump takes credit for an economy that is running on the remaining fumes of the Obama stimulus, while he doles out cash to the very wealthy, enhancing the wealth gap and turning over control to the Koch and Murdoch Cabal.
It will take decades, if not forever, for America to get back to being a first world country again.  

All will worsen as Trump's people deny the threat of temperature rise across the globe and refuse to address the    need to limit carbon dioxide and methane emissions.  They have decimated the EPA's role, making the Koch Cabal wealthier and the rest of us sicker.

It is time for a new president."
2020-05-07 09:49:57,"""Germany was a leader in the West in taking on the pandemic, and then a leader in the calibrated restarting of public life.""
It`s a pure scrap.
Germany was one of first Union States that took the Situation seriously and all it after tragedy in North of Italy.
Happenings in North of Italy were some kind of alert to the rest of EU: pandemic started to spread so rapidily how even in Vatican they are took on it. Silly People at first even fighted in the Streets with Officers demonstrating against Government because a whole Situation they`ve understood as restriction of their basic Rights (as traveling).
United Kingdom has been already  deep in Pandemic when in Germany they`ve started with serious measures.
How in Germany all it is more workable then in other Union States it is the other Question. Germans :D
It is simply in sense (mind) of People, like to not to throw away a Garbage in Nature, for example.
With  a return to daily Routine, some nordic countries started first. Germany even adopted their model of reopening known as ""stufig ins Alltag"". 
Cascading to daily Routine. 
Let`s take an example of Schools: since May 4th, Schools are open, but...
But?
But just for those who must to matriculate. 
Next week it will be reopen for some other categories and week after for the others etc.
In my street there is several ""kneipen"" working in last time with Licence for ""Kiosk"" because two Month of ""Lockdown"" is death for their small buissness…
A few more Stores are reopen, that`s all."
2020-05-07 09:16:13,Worrying. Not convinced the USA can afford Trump or his son in law for another 4 years.
2020-05-07 07:03:49,"Trump has not done one single thing to help in this ... not one single thing.  It's the most disgraceful thing I've ever seen.  He is now calling citizens warriors and he thinks they should lay down their lives for the economy.  What an absolutely vile, disgusting and grotesque excuse for a human being Trump is.  Like as if that is all the options, like there are no other choices.  Does anyone think for one moment Trump would lay down his life for anything or anyone?  

Not only is he doing nothing, he is actively working against the people trying to help, and here I talk about Ducey wanting to keep Arizona shut and after Trump went down there, he's suddenly opening up earlier and getting rid of scientists who are helping for no charge.  Trump's campaign people are making out like bandits and I'll bet Trump and his family is too because he knows he's going to lose big time.  I've never seen anything so disgraceful, and I hope I never see it again. Stay safe America, by yourself, because your president does not give one thought or care that you might die, you're only a number to him ... and a bad one."

2020-05-07 10:05:42,Germany is exemplar with how to manage the health and well being of the German people. They also have a meritocracy system  for university placement.
