2020-06-27 14:49,"Terrific investigative reporting. Someday, years from now, people will read this as they try to understand what went wrong in the Covid-19 pandemic of 2020."
2020-06-27 14:44,And we have a president who doesn’t wear a mask and spews false facts.
2020-06-27 15:01,"And here in the US, now, even knowing that people without symptoms can and do spread the disease, our president and many governors think they can bluff the disease away. 

Sure, the economy is important. But dead people are unemployed people. They also do not buy anythi"
2020-06-27 15:04,I wonder how much of this was down played because the doctors who sounded the alarm were women.
2020-06-27 15:04,"It’s not how the world; the question is almost exclusively how the United States is still watching in silence. Trump in his White “Palace” (built with American taxpayers’ money to which Trump does not seem to contribute much) keeps on blaming China even though China has managed to control the number of deaths outside Hubei Province to less than 1500. Now you don’t have to trust Chinese numbers — just look at other countries like South Korea and Singapore, focus especially on the TOTAL number of deaths. I have spent a good number of years in China and guess what? This administration is far worse in terms of the blatant lies it tells to the public — to the extent of insulting our intelligence."
2020-06-27 15:06,There is also evidence that the European strain is more highly contagious than the original from wuhan.
2020-06-27 15:07,Most of us already knew anyone infected with Covid19 can spread it whether they present Visible Symptoms or Not.
2020-06-27 15:07,"We need more clairvoyants in the public health field if we are to effectively battle pathogens.

And a little less blame assignment and petty finger-pointing."
2020-06-27 15:09,Tremendous reporting. This is why I subscribe to the Times.
2020-06-27 14:52,"How is it possible for any thinking person reach any conclusion other than that Trump is intentionally working to destroy our country?
I am a former long-time Republican who supports the Lincoln Project that is working to rid us of the Trump scourge."
2020-06-27 15:08,"Compared to the blinkered graveyard whistling of the Trump administration this seems like small potatoes. Still, it is chilling that the scientists stumbling over themselves to discredit Dr. Rothe and her team put semantics ahead of public health. I agree that words matter but with this much at stake it’s a shame that distinctions were confused with differences."
2020-06-27 14:40,Science is impartial. Scientists are often not impartial.
2020-06-27 15:09,"I have been aware of the inconsistencies in all COVID reporting almost since I first started reading about it in late Feb. Wikipedia had much information about it then and also included the perceptions of possibilities and likelihoods being circulated at the time. Just from a rather casual observer, the reporting over all has always contained elements of possibilities vs. probabilities. The overwhelming evidence to me was the exposure and infection among populations in close quarters--same ships, nursing homes, meetings, business, communities. The way COVID works in real life is quite different from any lab settings. It is obvious there are many factors in COVID that cannot be understood and given as definitive, indisputable fact. We can only trust what evidence from the real life spread. Scientific proof will have to catch up well after. 

Can we just focus on valid testing, treatments and vaccines? Please stop using poor tests for infection or anti-bodies! The inconsistent reliability of all the tests circulating around the world are not giving science the same information. How many test results need to be deleted as inaccurate or unreliable? Stop funding faulty or politically tainted research! Do vast pool testing. Keep reporting anecdotal evidence of outbreaks that clearly happen in 1 space, neighborhood, event, etc. Nothing will apply to everyone, everywhere."
2020-06-27 15:14,"As states across the country prepare to reopen schools in the fall, the case for reopening rests on scientific evidence that children are not as susceptible to infection, and that they do not spread the disease to other children or adults as readily when they do become infected. 

How trustworthy are these claims?"
2020-06-27 15:25,Excellent article. Politicization of medicine leads to tragic results.
2020-06-27 15:28,The important take away is the role that masking plays in stopping the spread.  Masking should be legally required — with immediate and publicized arrest so as to assure compliance — wherever social distancing is impractical.
2020-06-27 15:32,"Communicable diseases whether , bacterial /Viral always have incubation periods usually without feeling ill ."
2020-06-27 14:57,"The world did not miss the corona virus spread, only the world's most important partner, the United States of America. In virtually every other global disaster, MY country, America, was at the forefront, ready to help and take the lead with supplies, arms and technology. America's disastrous response to COVID belongs to one man, Donald Trump, and his cohorts in malfeasance. It is because of Trump that we do not have adequate supplies nor do we have contact tracing or a myriad of weapons and data we could use to combat this disease.

At a time when we needed General George Patton, we instead suffer a quisling who uses the crisis to line his pockets and plan his reelection. Trump's despicable cohorts in the senate and Justice Department created the Perfect Storm for the disease to spread. At any other time in America's glorious 243 year history, a defective president like Trump would have been removed after so many missteps and examples of complete incompetence.  Instead of America leading the charge, we have Trump advocating risky behavior and the insane injection of deadly chemicals.

It's understood that an electorate can make a mistake, but the larger mistake is our inability to correct our error by removing Trump from office."
2020-06-27 15:00,"No ``look-back'' is complete from an American perspective without explicitly addressing the attack on America waged from within by 45 and his administration.  The evidence is hard and clear that as a result of his/their political weaponization of the only known effective tools (distance, mask, test, trace) against the rapid spread of the virus for personal political gain, thousands of American lives have been lost, both young and old.  The data and transcripts of this process are non-deniable, and the onslaught continues.  His ``5th avenue'' banter was far tamer than what he has actually done.  Pence is on the trail pushing this propaganda, most likely out of fear that he will be replaced by Nikki Haley on the 2020 ticket (if she is dumb enough to take it)."
2020-06-27 15:10,"This is not the last pandemic of our lifetime. Will we have another one every 10 years? Every 5 years? Every year? How many mutations are possible? How many different diseases are out there ready to be spread by ever faster travel and, dare I say it, globalism?￼"
2020-06-27 15:20,"This is ridiculous. Everyone knew that the virus could be transferred before symptoms showed up which everyone knew took around 14 days to show up. That’s why you quarantine for 14 days  - to see if you have it and if you do, you wont transfer it during the quarantine. Every early study from China confirmed that if you got it you would more than likely get some symptoms.  This was a mountain out of a molehill - pre-symptomatic vs asymptomatic."
2020-06-27 15:20,"Hong Kong did not miss Covid 19. We have under 1,200 cases and only 7 deaths despite being on China’s door step. All credit due to our exceptional healthcare workers and responsible citizens."
2020-06-27 15:22,And there you have it: scientists can be just a petty as everyone else.
2020-06-27 15:18,"It's evident that everyone should be tested and those that are positive be quarantined and tracing be done on their contacts, who should be quarantined for 14 days."
2020-06-27 15:20,"If this is really true, it would mean the infection rate is much higher than reported (because asymptomatic people will mostly not get tested).  

If many more people are infected but not showing symptoms, it means the risk of infection and the mortality rate are lower than believed, because we are undercounting the infected.  

It means herd immunity will be achieved sooner, because the infection is spreading unnoticed and many peoples’ immune systems are dealing with the infection just fine.

I still find this very hard to believe.  The reason infectious diseases have the symptoms they do is they are the mechanism by which the infectious agent spreads— coughing, sneezing, runny nose, diarrhea, vomiting, hemorrhaging (or your body’s response to the infection— fever, inflammation).  All of the former category are about spewing copies of the virus.

What other infectious diseases do we know of that spread without any symptoms?

Isn’t it just as likely that the contact tracing was flawed?"
2020-06-27 15:29,Symptomless spread is common in many viruses. Often persons are most contagious prior to the development of overt symptoms. Asymptomatic carriers are a well documented phenomenon. It was foolish to rely on symptoms rather than virus testing to identify those who are disease vectors.
2020-06-27 15:31,"This illustrates the false sense of certitude that WHO and CDC had from the beginning.  They now need to strengthen the messaging on masks.  Yes, they also protect others, but they reduce the risk to you.  At least in the US, I believe many are more motivated by self-interest than altruism."
2020-06-27 15:19,"This article shows that scientists and top institutions can fall victim to group think.  Just because SARS-CoV-1 required symptomatic transmission, many top administrators thought presymptomatic transmission of SARS-CoV-2 to be impossible. This is a powerful lesson to always keep your eyes open to new information, and not to make overly broad assumptions."
2020-06-27 15:23,"Most of the 14 million college students (in 2000 odd colleges), and 56 million school kids in 130,000 schools in the nation will go back to school in September.  Please imagine 132000 Petri dishes of virus + dynamite.

Great geniuses (school and college administrators) have figured the whole thing out.  Not by scientific reasoning, but other motives.  We have imagined into existence, sterile schools and colleges where all kids maintain social distance and wear masks.  Teachers in masks too.  

Sure. This way, we won't be able to tell who is asleep.

The first Friday evening and all social distancing and masks are gone in 2000 campuses.

I will be back teaching my students in Fall; some 100 graduate and undergraduates.  I will wear a mask.  Students will sit, supposedly, six feet apart with masks, and walk through the maze like buildings in single file, one way.  Then they will all do as told in cafeterias and retreat wordlessly to their dorm rooms.  All this to keep the campus experience alive when everyone (students and teachers) have become very familiar with online teaching that keeps everyone safe.  

But online would make sense.  And when do we do what is sensible.  Never mind that we didn't have a cure or a vaccine in March 2020, and we wont when we open 132000 virus amplification Petri dishes in the Fall.  

If we are so dumb, what business do we have teaching anyone anything?"
2020-06-27 15:36,"This story is profoundly important.  It implies that COVID-19 will not be contained in most parts of the world.  Unless there is a dramatic shift to universal, repeated testing, most countries will be stumbling toward herd immunity.  

If this is a likely outcome, then the policy choice is binomial:  for any given population, immunity will result either from very widespread herd infection or from near universal vaccination.  Since herd immunity carries a much higher cost in terms of death and illness, it seems clear that the best choice is to encourage or mandate that most people stay home, wear masks, etc. until a vaccine is available. 

That painful scientific truth needs to inform public policy, even though it will be very controversial."
2020-06-27 15:39,"What we are now witness to represents a perfect storm.
A highly contagious and silently spreading virus, a population many of whom are unwilling and/or unable to follow simple procedures known to slow the spread, and a president-led politicization detrimental to public health.

Contrast this with a WWII citizens acceptance of food rationing, shortages in all manner of goods, and a total societal restructuring in support of the war effort.

So little is now being asked of us to slow this infection and even that is met with unreasoned resistance.  It seems that no number of deaths are too great to deter this president's re-election campaign.

It is said that people get the government they deserve.
Elections matter, competence matters, decency matters.
We have become weak and too easily led by the worst among us."
2020-06-27 15:40,"To me this is a much ado about the obvious. Yes at the very beginning we didn’t know if asymptomatic infection occurred. And then we did. Yes there have been missed messages, mistakes, the usual power grabbing for headlines, and political squabbles. The world has never faced this sort of problem before and we know how messy it can get when we combine human greed and ego with a new fatal and infectious agent causing a pandemic. 
The real investigative story is why we have not begun a massive campaign to start factories churning out N95 masks for everyone to use. They have been proven to be the best (I use them in my medical practice everyday for years), it is safe to presume that they could prevent untold numbers of infections and death. 
Why do we just have these masks for us healthcare providers to be used in health care settings? Why don’t we have them dispensed at every street corner? Why has this not been a priority since we have so little else at this point?"
2020-06-27 15:30,"It's funny, this blame game. I see references to ""false facts"" and ""false facts=lies"" attributed to Trump, as if he is the be-all and end-all to the problems that America is having with this virus. This nice piece of reporting turns that on its ear. How many people wagged their fingers at me when I questioned virtually everything that was being thrown against the wall by the scientists in the early going? How many people told me that Trump's initial gut reaction to shut down incoming travel was idiotic? I was actually infected by my asymptomatic daughter on March 14th, and scratched my head for weeks and weeks over virtually every doctor, and/or scientist I spoke with back then having different opinions about what was ""factual."" Blaming this health crisis on Trump, or any other world leaders is 110% ignorant."
2020-06-27 15:31,"This was reported in April by the NYT

<a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/11/us/politics/coronavirus-red-dawn-emails-trump.html"" target=""_blank"">https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/11/us/politics/coronavirus-red-dawn-emails-trump.html</a>.  And I quote:
""The concern these medical experts had been raising in late January and early February turned to alarm by the third week in February. That was when they effectively concluded that the United States had already lost the fight to contain the virus, and that it needed to switch to mitigation. One critical element in that shift was the realization that many people in the country were likely already infected and capable of spreading the virus, but not showing any symptoms. Here Dr. Lee discusses this conclusion with Dr. Robert Kadlec, the head of the virus response effort at the Department of Health and Human Services and a key White House adviser.""

Drs Caneva (HHS), Robert Kadlec, James Lawler, (Univ. Neb.,),Carter Mecher (VA), all were trying to sound the alarm  from their ""Red Dawn"" group.  They suspected the spreading was fast and asymptomatic, and they were getting single reports from China and elsewhere, just like Dr. Roche.  The rest is history, as the Trump administration, even today, can't admit that this is happening to the greatest country on earth.   Now it's the most infected country on earth!  Remember the equation of State:  Corruption + Incompetence + Injury=Vote them out of office, and including the R party enablers"
2020-06-27 15:34,"What a terrible irony the USA has been able to put in prison the dictators of other countries but not their own, that the USA exported ‘democracy’ abroad but isn’t able to protect it domestically. I left my home country because I was overwhelmed by the corruption and ineptitude of our political class and, while I didn’t expect any other country to be perfect, I thought I could accept more easily the flaws of political class in a foreign country. The last few years proved me wrong: human dignity seems not to care about your mother tongue or your passport."
2020-06-27 15:37,"An as-yet-to-be peer reviewed paper at <a href=""https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.08471"" target=""_blank"">https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.08471</a> has the percentage of infected patients who show no symptoms as high as 74%.  I heard about it on This Week in Virology podcast number 631.  I highly recommend listening to this valuable meeting place of minds from the scientific and clinical realms as information emerges on SARS-Cov-2 and COVID-19."
2020-06-27 15:42,"It is irritating that in the WHO’s most recent presser with Dr. Van Kerkhove, she repeated the myth of asymptomatic transmission being a rarity, and then chalking the push back to a misunderstanding.  Please, everyone, wear a mask and practice social distancing in public, for your sake and for everyone around you."
2020-06-27 15:36,"Excellent article. Kudos to New York Times reporters. This also put to rest the accusation of President Trump mishandled coronavirus outbreak. The only way he could have done anything different is if he had divine powers (he might think he has, but he does not). If the doctors and scientists could not agree on or form a consensus, do you expect a politician to understand it any better? I am sure Trump had plenty of warning from doubters and from those who were ultimately proven right. Considering the conflicting advice he got, he at least shut down travel from China and shut down the nation by mid-march before many other countries did. So I guess we should give him a break. While he was not perfect on coronavirus, he did well during an evolving pandemic."
2020-06-27 15:42,Asymptomatic transmission occurred with HIV/AIDS with devastating consequences.  I remember.  Why didn't they?
2020-06-27 15:43,"At the time they were attempting to discredit Dr Rothe, the WHO and health officials were telling us wearing masks INCREASED your chances of getting the virus due to creating a ""false sense of security"". They said this without any evidence whatsoever. It was completely false and even worse they may have known it and said it anyway due to the mask shortage. To compound matters with a ridiculous distinction between pre-symptomatic and asymptomatic spread is bewildering. Hopefully terrific articles such as this will lead to some of these officials being held accountable."
2020-06-27 15:47,"What is going on now is so unbelievable that we cannot really attribute blame to anybody, despite our human nature which compels us to find someone to blame for anything and everything. 

This is the stuff of science fiction come to life. We're all in this together. Let's be smart until a vaccination and a cure are developed."
2020-06-27 15:43,"This is an important article. Covid-19 is dangerous in part because of the dynamic aspects of its transmission. Folks who don't have symptoms or who have negligible symptoms can infect others. Whether or not they later go on to exhibit the self-evident symptoms of the virus. Hospitalizations lag case counts by 2 weeks. Deaths lag case counts by 3 weeks or more. The methods by which the virus is transmitted include especially the invisible transmission of the infection in indoor spaces. Short indoor meetings like choir practices or longer meetings like conventions have resulted in the infection of large numbers or even the majority of participants. Folks who have had no symptoms or negligible symptoms apparently generate so few antibodies that the antibody tests cannot detect them. Finally, we still don't understand the nature of immunity. Is it seasonal? Long term? Will it only serve to diminish the severity of future infections? The various models generally support all of these conjectures. The anti-science crowd in the White House is having a hard time understanding these dynamics. Their focus principally on re-election makes them to some considerable degree unwilling to recognize these dynamics. Solving the pandemic means finding everybody who is infected. That is only possible with widespread, random testing. Such an effort simply cannot succeed without national leadership.   

The epidemiological models support the conclusions here."
2020-06-27 15:48,"I was always wondering why people were considered ""not infected = not contagious"" after passing those tests with a fever measuring device.

That was way too easy."
2020-06-27 15:49,"I wonder why nobody was taking the reports from China seriously. It seems to me that China has been left out of this story for most of the part even though it was China where the first massive wave of spreading occurred. Moreover, it is mentioned in the story that Chinese health authorities had been sounding the alarm for a long time and the international scientific community just outright ignored them? Asymptomatic transimmison and the efficacy of masks had become common sense in China for a long time (since early February if I recall correctly) and almost all other counties had not adopted those policy until April... Had people treated the Chinese experience more seriously, things might not have been so bad."
2020-06-27 15:54,"I don't get how scientists or doctors aren't open to all possibilities. 

The only scene I remember from 1995's ""Outbreak"" was when Dustin Hoffman was jolted with the discovery their pandemic was airborne.

Viruses mutate -- we all know this!"
2020-06-27 15:57,"Now that so much more is known about Covid-19 - both it’s stealth contagiousness and variability in disease impact and outcome - it seems the only way we can responsibly move forward is to require mask wearing for everyone outside of their homes.  
Messaging needs to change: we now know that everyone is at risk for potentially disastrous outcomes, ranging from cytokine storms to seemingly mild disease w long term compromising health effects.  No one is safe. 
Since no one can know if they are a carrier, everyone - w/o exceptions - should wear masks in all public arenas. We keep hearing it’s safer outdoors, but once significant infection is present, spread is exponential irregardless. Only consistent mask wearing could introduce the necessary buffer to control this spread. Let’s de-politicize mask wearing and promote it as the human, neighborly responsibility we share in combatting and defeating Covid-19."
2020-06-27 15:58,"Thank you to all the Scientists involved in the studies of viruses and diseases. There are many lessons to be learned in the COVID era, we can only hope that wisdom is being absorbed and will be utilized in the next round in the plethora of unleashed viruses to come. Now we know that there are much worse things in the world than wearing a mask etc. The smarter and wiser world is the world for we."
2020-06-27 16:01,"Science is absolutely the key to understanding a pandemic or indeed other phenomena, like global warming, that threaten people all over the world.  But as this superb investigative report and thorough analysis demonstrate, science by itself is not enough because both within the scientific community and without, scientifically discovered truths can be suppressed, muddied, misinterpreted, or even denied outright when nebulous language, political jealousies, and misplaced skepticism, also both within and without the scientific community, interfere.  Science cannot save us from our political selves and when we speak at cross purposes as the result of our inability to agree on common terms."
2020-06-27 16:03,"What we have here is NOT a simple failure to communicate, but a failure on the part of the investigative Press, NGOs, Peer-reviewed science, Academia and Government. There are/were plenty of voices, but they are inhibited and/or blocked by the above institutions that are, according to Eric Weinstein, ""asleep.""   They are in an induced coma fostered and curated by a hierarchical structure dominated by reputation, image management, careerism and an insidious underlying financial dependence on corporate donors and governmental grant. This is the real Swamp."
2020-06-27 16:04,Science is objective but scientists are people.  They have biases and motivations that can impede scientific progress. The Covid-19 pandemic is unusual because it places a tremendous burden on the investigators to work quickly and to get things right the first time. The typical process of ruling out plausible but incorrect hypotheses by replication would lead to additional casualties.  Mistakes have been made but the level of cooperation between scientists across the globe is unprecedented
2020-06-27 16:04,"Global citizens need to demand more transparency and neutral oversight of those in power. Here in the U.S. that means politicians and all the companies that own the politicians who make our laws.

Until that happens tragedies like this will continue to happen."
2020-06-27 16:08,"To keep things in perspective, we are nearly halfway through 2020 and there is still so much we don’t know.
Why do some people feel little, if anything, from the virus while others suffer gravely or die?
Can you be reinfected after going through coronavirus?
Will its potential lethality change over time?
How much immunity can a vaccine provide and for how long?
We have to accept that some information is only going to become known over a long and painful period of time.  In the meanwhile, we just have to do the best we can to stop the spread."
2020-06-27 16:08,"I think in addition to ""herd immunity,"" we should enter into our vocabulary ""herd mentality."" The western world, in particular, seemed to believe that pandemics no longer occurred. After 1920, with the advancement of medicine, far too many people believed that we would very quickly have a vaccine and all would be well. Or that pandemics occurred in Asia or Africa and definitely not in advanced nations such as ours.

Unfortunately that herd mentality is still very much in play in this country and it seems safe to conclude a lot more people need to die before that attitude is quashed."
2020-06-27 16:11,"Hindsight is always 2020.
Nobody wants to hear bad news,

But learning from the past is the key to going forward in the right direction. Some have still not mastered that skill. Some choose not to."
2020-06-27 16:15,"I have a lot more confidence in my local medical institution (The University of Washington) than I do giant organizations like the WHO, CDC, and AMA. These regional universities know their populations best--and can be held accountable in a way bloated bureaucracies can't. We need local medical leaders to take charge. when my family doctor says wear a mask, it's happening."
2020-06-27 16:17,"No female scholar is going to be surprised by this story.  Women are not listened to, even when they are right.  Men and women believe men who are wrong until finally some man begins to believe the woman who is right, whereupon -- taking his authority rather than hers -- the tide may begin to turn . . ."
2020-06-27 16:19,"The rest of the world is used to following the lead of the United States on things like this. A normal United States government, which would have followed the advice of its health experts and taken swifter action as well as encouraging the rest of the world to do so, and perhaps even providing aid. Make no mistake,  because of the formerly dominant position of the U.S., not only can the worsening epidemic in the U.S. be laid at the feet of the Trump administration, a certain amount of the blame for areas globally where the pandemic is worsening can also be blamed on them."
2020-06-27 16:25,"My understanding is that ""super spreaders"" (sick people who infect a large number of others) are a far more likely explanation for outbreaks than asymptomatic spreaders.

Indeed, the article cites the case of a Chinese visitor who only felt ill *after* she returned home.  That seems to point to a an I identified third party who infected both the visitor as well as the German citizen, which is the simplest explanation.  This also fits with the reality that community spreading was happening in many places well before first cases were identified.

That said, it's entirely possible/plausible that people are still contagious for some period after recovering, that they have only mild symptoms, that they are managing their symptoms effectively with medication, and/or that they are downplaying their symptoms for whatever reason.  Truly asymptomatic spreading, however, is an extraordinary claim, and requires extraordinary evidence."
2020-06-27 16:25,"Anyone who has been involved with academic/research medicine, knows about the inherent competition among individuals and institutions.  My personal observation has been that competition does not serve the healthcare field very well, because it stifles communication.  The pettiness that results is exemplified in the situation this article describes.  Individuals and their institutions become invested in being first and being right, making admission of errors close to impossible.  This about egos, not seeking truth, the pure goal of scientific endeavor.  The only antidote to this sad manifestation of human nature is good leadership, which ameliorates the negativity of personal differences and fosters collaboration and cooperation.  Unfortunately we have not seen much of that in the past few years, in almost any forum, at any level, or in any field of enterprise.  Michael Tooke, MD, MPH, FRCSC"
2020-06-27 16:35,"The first word that comes to my mind is humility.  We all ought to feel it.  Science and data sound good, but the reality is very messy.  So much of what we thought we know is false or at least defective.  The scientific habit is to pronounce about Covid-19, as thought it were just like the many epidemics that have occurred.  Unfortunately, it was new.  What we knew in Jan/Feb was minimal, now a little better, in a couple of years we will realize all we did wrong.
Trump is no leader and is a mess, but in all likelihood Obama would have made the same mistakes had he been president."
2020-06-27 16:40,"It's important that any thinking individual be open to multiple sources of good information and retain their critical faculties to evaluate the sometimes faulty reasoning of public health authorities.

There were and are many sources of good (including raw reports from local reputable observers) information on infectious diseases such as the Pro-Med email newspaper - which published the initial December 31st report out of China.   Anyone can subscribe to Pro-Med email.

Also, I recall the simplistic, faulty and non-medical reasoning of the early recommendation from almost all medical officers of health to not wear N95 masks.
Part of this was to reserve such (non-surgical) masks for health workers - but this is not a medical assessment of the utility of such mask to anyone (such as woodworkers and others who might already have them) wanting to safeguard their health.
The other reason given by some health authorities for this wrong recommendation is that wearing such a mask would give the person a false sense of security and they would them indulge in reckless behaviour, such as not observing social distancing.  Just like the proposal to install air bags in vehicles was likely opposed on the grounds that air bags would encourage bad driving habits."
2020-06-27 16:41,"Accepting the possibility of asymptomatic spread entailed a vastly more complex response.  Unfortunately, when faced with this sort of dilemma people, even scientists, doctors and the highest level administrators, are not immune from the tendency people have of favoring the less complicated alternative."
2020-06-27 16:43,"It's not only the issue of asymptomatic/pre-symptomatic transmission that seems to have vexed some in the scientific community.  They were slow to come around to the possibility of airborne transmission as well.  I'm no expert, but it just seemed logical to me that a respiratory virus spreading as quickly as covid-19 must have a significant airborne component.  I realize that scientists want to have all their ducks in a row before announcing anything.  That's not a bad thing, as we've seen from the debacle surrounding hydroxychloroquine.  However, some parts of the scientific community seem to have had a very hard time letting go of their preconceived notions about how this virus is spread."
2020-06-27 16:44,"It's about behaving intelligently. I live in a well-educated, civic-minded neighborhood Oakland, California. Mask wearing and social distancing has been practiced around here since mid-March, with nearly 100% of the population going along with the protocol.

Using a Zip Code tracker for cases, just now, shows that we've had 16 reported cases and zero deaths, IN TOTAL! That's with an urban population of more than 16,000 people, right in the heart of the Bay Area, in a transit hub, surrounded by busy freeways, with an active street scene.

We haven't halted commerce. The key to our success is intelligent behavior. Wear your masks, stop the spread. It really isn't that difficult!"
2020-06-27 16:47,"Asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic are, it turns out, not the same thing.
And then, symptomatic does not mean the original fever, cough and shortness of breath.   Lots of other,  often mild, symptoms."
2020-06-27 16:50,"It seems that our primary lesson must be to block or otherwise prevent zoonotic pathogens.  The moment a disease makes that jump the world is in a full-fledged crisis.  This is far too serious to let cultural sensitivities stand in the way.  Selling or consuming live and/or wild meat needs to stop right now, before the next catastrophe erupts."
2020-06-27 16:55,"Leaving an asymptomatic unchecked is a sure-fire recipe to increase future death counts. If testing will be limited, naturally, an asymptomatic person will not be tested, leave alone isolation. Further, certain governments, primarily run by populists and authoritarians,  want to keep their infection number lower, so they may not want to identify asymptomatics.
For all safety purposes, it is better to assume everyone else as asymptomatic carriers. And maintain a safe distance and always wear a mask in public places."
2020-06-27 16:56,"Really great article on how science works, providing insight into how ego and bias impact the objective search for truth. Big thanks to the journalists involved.

But let's not be too hard on people. Generals always fight the last war, it is said, and in this case a lot of what was learned from the SARS outbreak was assumed to apply to COVID-19 as well - an honest mistake. And hindsight is 20/20. What appears obvious now was not necessarily so apparent back in March."
2020-06-27 16:57,"Sounds to me that the observation of asymptomatic/presymptomatic transmission was met with huge resistance because the implications of this being true would be so painful and would need extreme public health policies to contain the spread -- the kind of rules that are being used in some countries in Asia.    That would mean masking everyone at a time when masks are scarce, testing lots more people when tests are scarce, and quarantining a ton of people, slowing down the economy.  The alternative, sticking to the idea that only sick people transmit the disease and dismissing reports to the contrary almost sounds comforting and convenient.  

Really though.  An observation is an observation.  It can be explored further with more rigorous study rather than simply dismissing it.  It sounds like ego, and politics were a factor here, muddling the truth, and risking the health of an entire globe."
2020-06-27 16:59,"Lets not confuse the situation we are now facing with the debate over how and when asymptomatic contagion was found to be significant. We knew enough months ago to take appropriate precautions.

The massive outbreak we are suffering now was predicted by the CDC experts on the Corona Task Force. They warned if we open too soon and without monitoring/testing/tracing and isolation, the virus will erupt. It has.

Donald Trump ignored their advice and criteria regarding how to open up. He encouraged governors and others to ""liberate"" their people. He does not wear a mask and he is holding rallies in areas suffering out-of-control outbreaks. He has put the task force on mute and  does not attend their less frequent meetings. He doesn't come out in support of the expert advice they give in their few press opportunities.

Trump encouraged several weak governors,(eg DeSantis, Ducey, Kemp, Abbott.), to open up despite the data and warnings. The results while horrid are expected.

Half steps will not stop this now.

Even full blown shutdowns and stay-at-home orders will require weeks to plateau the daily contagion cases and it will be months before these areas complete NJ/NY/Ct type recoveries.

But these steps must be taken now. Chaos and mass sickness and death, collapse of the healthcare system are in store if we don't act now."

This is somewhat akin to asking a terrorist at an airport whether or not he packed his own suitcase.

How do *I* know whether or not I have symptoms? Just give me the test and let's see.

COVID-19 has piqued my curiosity and having recently finished both “The Coming Plague” by Laurie Garrett and “The Great Influenza” by John Barry I have come to truly appreciate (A) how “young” and at times off-the-mark the science of medicine is (B) how “young” the relatively recent understanding of the role evolution plays in the life of microbes and viruses truly is and (C) how easy it is for otherwise extremely intelligent, well credentialed and well meaning people can “get it wrong” regarding disease and public health. I applaud those with the perseverance to keep their shoulders to the wheel of ongoing research in a climate of extreme public and political pressure.
In medicine, it appears that “science” is rarely truly settled when one is in the thick of a pandemic and mistakes are often made in the heat of the moment. The mid-70s swine flue pandemic that everyone thought would be a repeat of 1918...but never happened is a classic example. 
It’s hard to believe but in the 1950s and early 60s many politicians and scientists really believed that all microbe-based infectious disease would be banished from the planet within a generation. Malaria eradication resources were significantly “defunded”...to use a recently popular word...by the mid-1960s.

The number of lab-confirmed cases in Minnesota has increased 37% — from 25,208 on June 1 to 34,616 as of Friday — but the numbers among people aged 6 to 19 increased 61% in the same time frame.

It is quite obvious that no governing leader expected this on their watch, the one consolation that we have is that during this 21st century, both medicine and technology has advanced and that many of our world leaders excluding the present President of the United State, his VP, his cabinet and the leader of the Senate Moscow Mitch do believe in science, hopefully a vaccine is imminent and that it can and will produce positive results worldwide as at no time should any country work exclusively for themselves. It is incumbent and urgent that all Americans report to their voting station on November 3, 2020, and oust this incompetent President, Vice President, and enablers. Presently most countries are still in the first wave, some are more fortunate that they have been able to flatten the curve yet there is an awareness that with the fall coming, the possibility of no vaccine  and a second wave will be stronger and more devastating, this is something that all of us in the international community should be vigilant of as we see many ramifications from having reopened too soon and not followed guidelines provided by the CDC"

We Would Die of the Virus or Not. The System Would Roll On. Prison officials did everything they could to prevent a coronavirus outbreak. Everything except release prisoners.

2020-06-27 16:41,"The world didn't miss much at all, once it was possible to gather and evaluate relaiable data from known and trustworthy sources.

The Chinese Communist Party leadership lied about the outbreak, took steps to conceal the nature and specifics of the pathogen, imprisoned persons seeking to alert the world, and put severe limits on internal travel while encouraging international travel from Wuhan.

They knew exactly what they were doing. This is, in effect, biological warfare by proxy - all they had to do was sit & watch without lifting a finger or spending a single yuan, to wreck western economies and cause worldwide disruption.

As a result, it took a lot of time for our scientists to gather data, do virology and pathology tests, and begin to address the epidemic.

As as should be clear to all but the densest of ideologues, we are still learning about this virus.

Casting blame is, to be charitable, unhelpful, except in the case of the Chinese Communist Party, who should face the heaviest of penalties when this is finally controlled.

Using this outlet to frame the outbreak as a political capital to be used against the opposition is a cheap stunt, as is the suggestion that officials intentionally concealed or delayed actions.

There was a dumb move by government: to tell everyone not to wear masks. 

The result was increased spread of a poorly understood pathogen. Concern over availability to medical staff blinded them to the reduction in case load it would have created."

Eight major players including his campaign manager and his former (for 24 days) National Security Advisor had broadly conspired with Russia to not only overthrow the US, but mandate the will of Vladimir Putin to destroy American's faith in their government. This is very clearly outlined as a ""plan of war"" executed by the Russian GRU, at the direct order of Putin himself. That COVID-19 had become the pandemic, uncontrolled and misunderstood is due to human error and the true action that ""slow walking"" a plan of action is not taking action, but hindering action.

I will preface this with the fact that as devastating and lethal as AID's was and remains, it paled in comparison to Covid-19's path of destruction.  We were told to assume that every patient we many encounter and care for may be carriers.  That is a basic tenet of medicine with any infectious disease, including the common flu, to never take for granted the chance that people can be carriers.  Also, there is always a period of incubation with these viruses, and during those times one is often contagious.  With this pandemic, every one messed up, from its onset to the present day.   What causes me angst and agita, however, is how developed countries throughout the world are learning and indeed have learned.  Except for the United States.

The ONLY way to get the coronavirus under control is with very strong measures: lockdowns, masks and social distancing, quarantining and contact tracing. These steps must not be “guidelines” or “recommendations” but absolute requirements, with summonses and fines for those who don’t follow the rules. 

It may sound harsh and untenable, but it’s better than hundreds of thousands of people dying unnecessarily.

People you would ordinarily consider brilliant.

Yet when faced with the explanations concerning problems on their projects by the rules that architects and engineers live by, which were either building code, environmental, or mechanical system code related, the level of haughtiness and thinly veiled contempt for the Bachelor degree level designers seeped into the project meetings. Even more so when a project cost was required to be increased to accomplish the desired results in accordance with industry standards. I remember leaving this job utterly exhausted.

I thought of this experience while reading the bit about the Koch Institute group going behind the back of Dr Rothe’s group to interview the Chinese virus carrier, no doubt to undermine them. Then to find out the Koch Institute group gets to publish an acclaimed article, while the world suffers far more than it would have if Dr. Rothe’s discovery had been given the credit due.

Plus, preventing silent spreading required aggressive, widespread testing that was then impossible for most countries.

It's the same reason that in the US the CDC etc. initially (and for quite a while) advised people not to bother with masks: knowledge that there _weren't enough_ masks, and fear that everyone would grab and hoard the few available, putting health workers at risk.

Fauci and others explicitly said as much at the time, and reiterated it later. And that was the _right_ thing to do, even if the message was somewhat misleading (because combined with the additional, true, message that masks on the infected are more important than masks on the uninfected).

In an emergency, the most important people to protect are the first responders and others helping rescue and care for the rest of us."

WHO's report on 12/31/19 of several unusual pneumonias in Wuhan was taken seriously by Taiwan, which sent officials, that same day, to screen arrivals from Wuhan before they deplaned and identified for continued testing and tracking. Their first cases were found 1/15/20 and by 3/18, their were 100 cases. Taiwan's pandemic response was activated early in January, including extensive testing, contact tracing, shoring up PPE and hospital resources. Their VP, a respected epidemiologist and virologist delivered factual briefings daily. Taiwan has had a total of seven covid deaths and lockdowns were not needed.

As for transmissibiliity, Taiwan conducted a study of the transmission of the virus from those first 100 cases. Transmission was found to be greatest in the first 6 days after symptom onset (attack rate 1.0); but transmission also occurred within 5 days prior to symptom onset, although at a lower attack rate of 0.7 (JAMA 5/1/20). Attack rate = cases in a susceptible population/people in that susceptible population.

So here are medical experts in German and Taiwan worried and paying close attention to covid as early as 12/31/19. It is mentioned a scientist from Columbia University and one at Stanford were concerned. Anyone else worried in the US?"

Do their lives not matter? or Do we say too bad most had passed their average life span? No not at all, every life matters and every life has to be treated with dignity and we need to take care of them with the best of our abilities. JOY to the WORLD for Dexamethasone (Dex) is available as a possible life saver precisely for adults above 55,  who are most likely to die from the COVID-19 spread. Dex is not the wonder drug that will work wonders. It is NOT an ANTIVIRAL. It is a steroid that has immunosuppressive and anti-inflammatory activity. What does inflammation (InFla) have to do with COVID-19 infection? Most COVID-19 infections are mild or asymptomatic in adults below 55. But in infections with full blown symptoms associated with COVID-19, mostly in patients above 55 or those with genetic or acquired immunodeficiencies there is a progression to the next stage of uncontrolled InFla accompanied by organ damage. That is when Dex could be a life saver. From what we know now that we did not know 4 months ago when COVID-19 was spreading like wild fire is those who were dying were dying from both the lung damage and organ damage."

Simply because the work of Camilla Rothe and Michael Huelscher was supported by Christian Drosten. Drosten has the public standing of a genius and is the most influential virologist in Germany due to a (then) daily scientific podcast. Robert Koch Institute on the other hand has a rather mixed track record of public policies.

People don't like their freedoms being contained so the virus will spread and the USA will keep making excuses for the lack of discipline amongst it's citizens, and lack of authority and re-enforcing social distancing rules, by the majority who just want to do what they normally do and keep making excuses for their behaviour.
It's an oxymoron - people need their freedom and to get outside and do their normal activities otherwise their psychological health suffers and indirectly I think a lot of these mob protests are more to do with their frustrations at  their nation not being able to control covid-19 or find a successful vaccine to eliminate the virus.
It will come back to bite you on the backside as many international nations are not allowing USA citizens into their nations because of the rapid spread of the pandemic in your nation.

In America, many infantile and childish leaders and citizens clamored for the 'freedom' to not think about, the 'freedom' to be intellectually lazy and scientifically ignorant, and the 'freedom' to recklessly spread the virus with the 'freedom' to never wear a mask and the 'freedom' to not be responsible.

And of course, America had the worst possible leader (outside of Brazil) for the coronavirus, a man who dismissed it, ridiculed it, minimized it, sold snake oil solutions to it, and then kept dismissing it as the American bodies piled up and the economy tanked.

America, with the help of the Know Nothing party and its Dear Leader, has reduced America to a quasi-3rd world country.

And finally, the world of scientific research (and, at that, we’re talking about “clinical research” here) may be a bit too competitive for the ultimate good. Interestingly, this article mentions about being “scooped” by a few hours. The drive to be recognized and praised may, in other words, lead to hasty and wrong endpoints."

Silent spread, in hindsight, was behind the super-spreader even in Connecticut, a sort of wealthy  afternoon soiree attended by people from all over the world, who returned home with a huge ""gift.""   It was also linked Boston's early outbreak in Seaport, Boston.

Where I live, a retirement complex on the campus of a college university, we  follow the most rigid of protocols based on one basic assumption: treat every single person you encounter as a potential carrier.  From March on, we were told to don masks outside our apartments, and stay outside the larger community.

It's been very hard but it kept us alive.  Too bad the Trump administration didn't push that message instead of pushing to ""open up"" despite the best evidence."

Effectively tackling the problem of COVID-19 spread has shut down the economies of nations across the globe, forced populations into seclusion, and probably that forced seclusion has resulted in a lot of aggression, violence, and suicide. And more than a few stressed marriages.

It was not wrong for governmental agencies (including WHO) to employ lower-intensity measures at the outset, even though we can now judge that as a mistake. China opted for high-intensity measures at the outset, and those efforts succeeded. But China is a totalitarian nation and most democracies would not have accepted such a lock-down at the beginning of the epidemic.

We continually hear that we are fighting a war against Covid-19, which is true. But now we learn that, just like the U.S. intelligence agencies prior to 9/11, various scientific/medical organizations are not sharing or considering bits and pieces of pertinent information gleaned about Covid-19. In both cases, the political concerns of individual groups are prioritized over the health of the people they were created to serve. 

While we all still have much to learn about this virus, one thing is absolutely clear — it’s absolutely impossible to win any kind of war when allies and battlefield commanders are marching to different beats from different drummers. 

Factual information is our best weapon. Too bad it’s in such short supply, these days."
2020-06-27 18:00,"It seems to me that the primary culprit is China.  According to a new Rand Corporation study, China understated its reporting of Covid 19 caseload by a factor of 40.  That's right, 40.  Take what they reported and multiply by 40.  85,000 cases becomes 3,400,000.

In addition, it has been reported that surveillance satellites as far back as August of 2019 saw dramatic increase in traffic into Wuhan hospitals which only continued to rise.

These two pieces of data combined with numerous studies that show how tens of thousands of Chinese traveled by air out of China between August of 2019 to the curtailment of such travel strongly suggests that many more of these Chinese travels were infected than originally reported.  

So, the Chinese government knew they had a major problem as far back as August of 2019, decided to dramatically systematically understate the magnitude of the problem (ultimately by a factor of 40) and to support this policy of understatement, allow international travel well after the severity of the situation was known to them.  I think these three data points are at the center of what led to the world-wide pandemic we now have."

I expect some future reckoning about whether the long recession-inducing lockdown was needed as opposed to an effective policy of firewalling the known vulnerable - as it is, the impact on care home elderly has been disproportionate and cruel and ""everybody"" is still losing dollars by the week."

2020-06-27 17:36,"It is grimly ironic that the thing the Republican majority hates the most - science in the public interest -- is the single greatest factor here for the greater public health. Yet, Misters Trump and Pence refuse to acknowledge this. How else to explain their refusal to wear facial masks, as 99.9 percent of all other Americans are doing when in public situations."
2020-06-27 17:45,Is this another lesson learned for pandemic response? Presume asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic spread until proven otherwise; not the reverse.
2020-06-27 17:25,"The normal process of publishing scientific discoveries is a) proceed from preliminary evidence on a small number of cases to a much broader sample that confirms the initial discovery; b) submit an article to a peer-reviewed journal; c) the journal's editors send it out to knowledgeable, independent readers; d) they report back and; d) the article is only published if they believe the research is sound. This takes 9 months to a year at least.

In this emergency, every facet of this process was  understandably by-passed. Dr. Rothe was initially reporting on a single case of asymptomatic transmission. In the early days, t was impossible to develop a sample of asymptomatic transmitters. Yet the public health consequences of the discovery were enormous.  

The inevitable conflict between scientific research and the urgency of time is again manifest in the search for safe and effective vaccines, and the subsequent, formidable challenge of their affordable global distribution. Hopefully the errors made in the early months of this response, well described in this important article, will  be taken seriously in the vaccine quest, and  will prevent the pressure exerted by political leaders and impatient citizens for a vaccine that can end this pandemic from delivering us a product that is not safe and effective."
2020-06-27 17:55,"A very detailed article, which totally fails to state the truth: had the Chinese government isolated Wuhan earlier, this worldwide tragedy could have been prevented.  They did not do so out of terror of annoying their central government leaders,  and when some brave doctors in Wuhan sounded the alarm, the central government was helped in its inaction when WHO chose to praise the government's denials and ignored the imprisoned doctors."

I alerted the Alzheimer's community. 

So I took Screaming immediate action on March 6, based on very limited data because the  risk was Awful .  The lethargy mendacity and stupidity of the administration was appalling.

2020-06-27 17:39,"The very first step is for the country of origin, in this case China, to do two things: (1) invite in the W.H.O., the U.S. C.D.C., and other agencies equipped to deal with a lethal virus, and (2) to immediately quarantine the area in an effort to contain it. China did neither allowing the virus to escape around the world. And then, of course, the same mistakes were made by President Trump and others like Governor Andrew Cuomo in New York as well as many European nations like Italy and Spain. The covid-19 virus is now everywhere and the continued inept Republican federal leadership is being compounded by their Republican red state governors in the South and Southwest. Without mandatory ""stay-at-home"" lockdowns which Vice President Pence, the Head of the Coronavirus Task Force, said was ""never considered; the mandatory wearing of face masks which Trump refused to wear; and mandated social distancing in businesses, there is no possibility of containing the virus. And, that is exactly where we are today as Republican politicians refuse to follow these guidelines. And, it if history is predictive, there will be an even more virulent second wave as the virus continues to mutate. That is the bleak future the nation faces until and unless Trump and his Republican enablers are removed from office and other elected who will take the appropriate forceful and strictly enforced actions."
2020-06-27 18:01,"I’m just the very average layperson, but I figured asymptomatic transmission was probably a thing. Why not? 

I wore a mask when they directly advised us not to, because their logic didn’t add up.

Waiting for policy-makers to make the rules before we bother to protect ourselves would be willful denial and a lack of imagination. Going to a bar or a hairdresser just because our county moves to some arbitrary “phase” allowing it—even as we watch the statistics blow up—would be lying to ourselves.

Do the safest thing, stopping short of doing something worse. If your lifestyle choices don’t make sense in light of what we know or don’t yet know, don’t wait for anyone to tell you to change them. Until we have a vaccine and/or a cure, the only thing we can do is adhere to razor-sharp common sense and caution."

Singapore and Australia receive fleeting mention; Taiwan, New Zealand and South Korea are not even brought up.

Let’s hope we will take that opportunity."
2020-06-27 17:31,"Part of the reason it took so long to find explanations for transmission of COVID 19 was scientists did not have all methods of discovery available to them.  Because PPE supplies were no longer stockpiled,although this was recommended by Obama and previous administrations’ pandemic studies, and contact tracing not immediately used because this administration refused to work with WHO and use their testing products, information that other countries quickly discovered was not available here.  Because the Trump administration did not stress and may have even discouraged international cooperation other problems may have gotten in the way.  This is just one of many problems that can arise when a stunningly incompetent person is elected to a position of leadership.  

We are still lacking adequate PPE and testing and contact tracing are rudimentary.  Part of the population does not understand their significance, are confused and may not participate as they have shown  by being unable to follow more basic safety instructions of masking, isolating and basic hygiene.  This is due to a lack of strong, intelligent leadership.  We have a President who cannot grasp the importance of Public health and must rely on his intellectually stunted greed for the basis of all decisions, in turn endangering every u.s. citizen.  He should be urged by all responsible leaders, especially Republicans, to quit his office now and save untold lives."

2020-06-27 17:31,"The thing that dismays me so greatly is the overwhelming politics ingrained even in the scientific community, and worldwide scientific community.  We can no longer trust what the WHO, CDC, NIH, Surgeon General says not because of honest scientific error, which I can accept, but because of unscientific political motives in what and how they communicate in order to manipulate the behavior of the population.  Just like politicians many of these scientists and their organizations seem to be more concerned about controlling their narrative than at getting at the scientific truth and communicating that truth in an unadulterated and unadorned manner to the public.

They have really shot themselves in their foot in terms of credibility.  Now who do we look to for truth?  Because, what good is it to listen to “the experts” and “follow the science” when we are really getting Covid political propaganda instead?"

This makes it look like the state goverment is reacting. Most restaurants have bars in them and they are still open, with customers not even social distancing. There are even restaurants where the servers are not wearing masks because the guidelines are very loose.

However, equally stupid is the default position advocated by many to slavishly accept and adhere to the judgements of those same medical experts.

There is a wiser middle ground!

The experts are never all-knowing and infallible.  Many of them even often differ on many related matters.  And, especially in a case of a new disease like this one is, their judgements are very often barely informed, even often falsely informed.  That makes their judgements always of limited reliability and sometimes completely wrong  

Furthermore, the experts are human beings who often have personal socio-political agendas.  Thus, we saw the doctor who is the US Surgeon General emphatically implore us not to wear masks and even to lie to us by claiming that if members of the general public wear masks they will actually increase the likelihood they will become infected.  We also saw similar claims by the CDC experts that masks don't protect the general public and the CDC told the public not to wear masks.  Of course, the reason that the Surgeon General and CDC did that was to preserve the masks for use by medical workers, but they did not trust the public to comply so they lied to us

The better, wiser middle ground is to always seek and listen to expert advice, but to listen with a critical mind and insist upon presentation of some substantiation before even accepting it as expert judgment"

Covering mouth and nose with a facial mask became part of a branch of medicine called “ hygiene “ to limit the spread of infectious diseases .
The discussion of asymptomatic, paucisymptomatic or symptomatic Covid spreaders seems futile .
If Covid  is present in saliva or oropharyngeal secretions the propagation of virus via Fluegge droplets while talking , singing , coughing, sneezing etc will occur .
So just wear a facial mask according to medical rules ,  personal freedom impinging upon everyone’s health is idiotic and should be fined . We shall start with trump and pence and all those ignorant sycophants Covid spreaders ."

In the 1980’s I was a student in a public health program. When I tried to register for a course in infectious disease epidemiology I was told to focus on chronic diseases. The theory was that infectious diseases had been conquered. Hospitals were getting rid of expensive hospital beds and emphasizing more lucrative outpatient care. Then we began to hear of a strange new condition that turned out to be HIV. To be taken seriously the gay community had to start a rebellion. We don’t seem to learn much.

2020-06-27 18:13,"The broad reluctance of governments everywhere to delay action until it was too late is due to what's (appropriately) called the ""wishful thinking fallacy"".

<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wishful_thinking"" target=""_blank"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wishful_thinking</a>

The central premise of the wishful thinking fallacy is that there is something so horribly difficult about facing the truth -- in this case, the deaths of millions of people -- that the mind spontaneously develops alternative realities.  From Wikipedia:

""When we embark on a course of action which is unconsciously driven by wishful thinking, all may seem to go well for a time, in what may be called the ""dream stage"". But because this make-believe can never be reconciled with reality, it leads to a ""frustration stage"" as things start to go wrong, prompting a more determined effort to keep the fantasy in being. As reality presses in, it leads to a ""nightmare stage"" as everything goes wrong, culminating in an ""explosion into reality"", when the fantasy finally falls apart.""

Falls apart.  Indeed.  

All roads lead to November.  It is every American's patriot duty to help these dreamy little Republican puppies in Washington cuddling up to Hound Dog Trump find a location more suitable to their activated feral natures, wherein logic and reason have no place, to the increased suffering of us all.

Honestly, my Republican Senator (Toomey) in Pennsylvania reminds me of just this.  He pretends like Covid-19 doesn't even exist.  He's a dreamy little puppy killing us with his nothing."

(Of course, plenty of comments here reflect the misinformation this paper previously and repeatedly printed.)  Furthermore, the literal avalanche of articles this paper printed regarding collusion with Russia were, similarly, simply not the truth.  Should not the editors and writers here openly admit their ""mistakes?""

2020-06-27 18:04,"In the mathematical field of probability, there is the concept of an expectation value.

Let X  be a random variable with a finite number of finite outcomes x1 , x2 , … , xk occurring with probabilities p1 , p2 , … , pk,  respectively. The expectation of X is defined as

    E ⁡ [ X ] =   x1*p1 + x2*p2 + ⋯ + xk*pk . 

Since the sum of all probabilities pi  = 1 the expected value is the weighted average of the xi values, with the pi values being the weights.

If all outcomes xi are equiprobable (that is, p1 = p2 = ⋯ = pk, then the weighted average turns into the simple average. If the outcomes xi are not equiprobable, then the simple average must be replaced with the weighted average, which takes into account the fact that some outcomes are more likely than the others. 

<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expected_value"" target=""_blank"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expected_value</a>

In terms of this pandemic, that means that if the probability of transmission by people prior to becoming symptomatic is very small (say 1/100 of 1 percent or 0.0001) but the consequence (a likely worldwide spreading of the virus) is enormously bad and very serious, the expectation value of a bad outcome for a pandemic could easily be extremely large (0.0001 times a very big number, like 100,000,000).

The fundamental error was ignoring that expectation value. Obviously W.H.O. and others assigned it a very small number, and they probably did not consider the math at all."

Then suddenly they became the panacea and we MUST wear them.  Those who originally said ""don't wear them"", in my mind, are responsible for many deaths!  Lately, we have Cuomo, who has become an arrogant governor advertising his willful blindness about the nursing homes deaths.

True scientists who only care about the purity of observation and factual data have no problem sharing puzzling results in the hope that other like minds can pool in and solve the puzzle. Why should science be rigid? Why should the public support science that after decades seem to have wasted resources and time in asking all the wrong questions. Why should we fund a scientific military that believes the only approach to microorganisms is to view them as ‘enemies’ and annihilate them? It is time to revolutionize thinking and get rid of these aging useless scientists who are a dead weight on the evolution of knowledge. 

Disgusting. I am in no hurry for a ‘cure’ from scientists. All they care about is manufacturing the most complex solution that will perpetually create funding for big pharmaceuticals.

2020-06-27 18:18,"While accusations against China on its handling of the virus and suppressing or withholding vital information about it are valid, the real issue is that China’s livestock industry is unregulated.

China manages its economy on the cheap as the source for the coronavirus pandemic is China’s unregulated livestock industry which is a cesspool for the frequent outbreaks of dangerous viruses and bacteria. The science of the transfer of virus from animals to humans has been proved. There will be more pandemics originating from China as long as China’s livestock industry is unregulated.

China’s export-driven economy, built on using a large pool of cheap labor which has driven most competitors out of the export market, has amassed a fortune of US$3.12 trillion in foreign-exchange reserves since the early 1970s.

There must be a debate at the WHO and UN on the damage and destruction caused by China’s gift to the world that keeps on giving and is taking away and destroying lives and world economies. China must compensate all affected countries for the international impact arising from its incompetence and mismanagement of its unregulated livestock industry and health system that has allowed the coronavirus pandemic to damage the world so extensively. It can afford to do so beginning with its amassed fortune of foreign-exchange reserves."

Even doctors have to rely on how a person describes their experience, and they still have to assume that the description is accurate and truthful.

2020-06-27 18:49,"It is disappointing that world class scientists are so apt to spout off about a virus that we know nothing about early in the course of the pandemic.

The facts  in late January and early February was that it was a novel virus, had been quite fatal in Wuhan and was a coronavirus.  The genome was available but there was very little other firm evidence.

Rather than disparaging well meaning on-the-line physicians, these 'experts' should have been warning the public that we have a novel virus that is associated with a significant morbidity and mortality and we are doing all we can to learn about it in order to reduce the effect on our human population.

While this data was accumulated, the scientists should have recommended all of the usual low tech measures that can be easily taken with no cost or risk: mask wearing, gloving, social distancing, hand washing.

Instead we had doom and gloom from some quarters and no big deal from others.  Not science's finest hour by any means.

Fortunately for those living in civilized, law abiding countries with intelligent empathetic, science directed leaders these recommendations were given and followed and those countries are doing just fine.

The US is an entirely different breed of cat.  Uncivilized violent self absorbed leaders have intentionally downplayed the risk and we have tens of thousands dead and millions infected with NO organized reaction to the threat four months later.

Pathetic but typical lying republican governance."
2020-06-27 18:31,"Despite the closed-minded and fatal dismissal by old guard scientists of Dr, Rothe's observations, Germany has managed to have on of the lowest impacts of COVID. 

In the US Trump politicized the COVID pandemic and made the economy a far more important issue 

Trump systematically let the coronavirus pandemic get out of control as follows: 

Destroying the CDC’s capacity to deal with a pandemic in 2018;  In response to the pandemic, Trump said, ""I don't take any responsibility at all.""; Trump ignored dire warnings in January and February from U.S. intelligence agencies about the coronavirus pandemic; Failing to establish critical testing early on to contain the spread of the virus. Trump even said "" One day it's like a miracle—it will disappear."" ; Failing to procure medical supplies.hospital beds needed to meet the scale of this public health crisis; Appointing anti-science Mike Pence to run the White House Coronavirus Task Force; Favoring governors who are political allies when distributing lifesaving medical supplies instead of distributing supplies based on most urgent need; Failing to allow competent experts to manage this crisis. 

Now in the face of COVID resurgence Trump and his administration are still attempting to to force an end to a critical shutdown. If they succeed, even more people will needlessly die for the sake of Trump's ego. Are Republicans proud of the death and destruction brought to this nation by their chosen leader."
2020-06-27 18:48,"Using a bandana, cut T shirt, or other home made face masks was always an option for the public. Advising the public not to wear masks, that it did no good, was remarkably and tragically incompetent medical advise when it was given.
 Totally contrary to common sense. It caused untold suffering and death because much more could have been done to slow or stop the spread if the public had been given competent medical advise on face masks."

Sadly, the Americans are to blame for this, mainly because they kowtow to China's demands and have been doing so since the time of Nixon."
2020-06-27 18:32,"Wearing masks should be mandatory. The main reason is that any employee will be able to refuse to be around unmasked people at work and report this business to authorities.  Then there is a chance to buy some time until the vaccine is developed: avoid those who do not wear masks in public. Don't get close to them.  Change the side of the street when you see one of them. Don't get in a store where you see an unmasked person. Then, hopefully, masked and hand washing folks will not transmit the virus among themselves, or transmit much less. Careless people will get sick and, eventually, become immune or die. But the key is to have an official mandate on wearing masks. I heard  Biden has committed to doing it."

THAT WAS THE TIME travelers from China should have been barred from travel outside China and within China. Politics and greed were and are controlling the response. The Trump administration and local and national Republican leaders continue to deny the severity of this plague and are aggressively trying to destroy the A.C.A., our last bulwark needed to treat unemployed people - just because they can - citing the economy is more important than lives.

2020-06-27 19:46,"Very interesting article. I have never doubted that asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic spread can and does occur. But I continue to have doubts about how often this happens, and under what circumstances it is likely to happen. 

The first example mentioned in this article involves a person from China who apparently infected several people at an auto company. There is a reference to a ""long meeting"" or meetings. But much is not detailed: How long was the meeting? How big was the room?  What kind of ventilation in the room? How many other people in the room? How many of these became infected? Did the person from China spend time with any of the meeting participants outside of the meeting ...

Another example given involves the passing of a salt-shaker in a cafeteria. How long were these two individuals in the cafeteria? Where were they seated in relation to one another? Or perhaps they were both just passing through in a hurry and one had a sudden urge to ask the other for a salt-shaker? How many other people were in the cafeteria? Is it possible that a third person passed the virus to both of the salt-shaker people?

It would be very helpful to know the details of these and other cases so that we could begin to unravel how asymptomatic spread actually happens, and perhaps more importantly, how it does not happen."

2020-06-27 18:16,"My countrymen;
As much as I respect Dr. Fauci, he and CDC dropped the ball on asymptomatic transmission. An ordinary citizen like me, read this German report in late January. Same day I looked to buy N 95 respirators on Amazon. They were selling 50 for $18. I did not buy thinking that, what would I do with 50 masks. But I was convinced of veracity of German report. So eventually on 15 Feb, I bought two N 95 masks for $17. This is the summary of statement Dr. Fauci gave , in front of house sub committee few days ago. He did not wish to recommend people using masks, so that people will not go out and deplete N 95 and surgical masks needed for health workers. But, my question to Dr. Fauci (who I hope does not live under a rock), “Did you not see thousands of Chinese and Koreans wearing simple cloth masks? Even in early February?”. And you and CDC, WAITED till end of March to make exact same recommendations about masks that Koreans were already following for 2 months. 30,000 deaths could have been prevented, if you had found these simple words on 2 March. “Every one should wear simple cloth mask or face covering when out in public”.    Why did you not know this simple preventative strategy on 2 March, when Koreans and Chinese were already using it for months? So you are not blame free Dr. Fauci. And CDC, you are not blame free."

2020-06-27 19:18,"One major reason why Western countries missed  and dismissed the severity of the virus because they assume that the problem is worse in China because its medical procedures are behind the West,  and the government decision to quarantine a whole city is medieval, archaic and cannot be implemented in democratic societies.
There was also a general distrust of any reports that come of China, and Medical professionals in the US by and large chose to reinvent the wheel by modify their own medical procedures rather than read up on what medical procedures are considered  best practice in China and other parts of Asia. 
I would also suggest that tracing of the spread of the virus to the West may need to push back to the October time frame rather than from January on. A recent report on This week with George  Step. (<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iD0XdpSKxA"" target=""_blank"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iD0XdpSKxA</a>)  suggest that the spread of the virus may have started in October 2019, approximately the same time frame when Wuhan hosted  the World Military Game (WMG)  for 10 days.  According to Wikipedia,   220,000 + volunteers helped with the WMG, and athletes from many countries attended and participated. At the minimum, WMG could be the super-spreading event that turned Wuhan into a giant hot spot. Though it is less likely that the athletes participating in open air stadiums would have caught the virus, researchers may  still want to check whether they came down with similar symptoms afterwards."

are lashing out with frustration about ""mixed messages"" spewing
from politicians (mostly self-serving Republicans): one day

the next day, that it is not.

Understandably, given the veritable evaporation of revenues and
profits -- the nation's economic collapse, business owners (and
their political enablers), having reached a level of desperation,
are reopening businesses too soon. The consequence: Covid-19's
current spike.

When the history of Covid-19 is written, what will be pegged as society's greatest tragedy during the pandemic -- after the horrible death count -- will be that too many either refused, or were too ignorant, to abide by that truest of all fable morals: Slow but steady wins the race.

(A Quick Aside: It's so important to live creatively during this pandemic. For starters, I get my fruits and vegetables now from
a garden.)

And now, back to the moral of our story:

Sacrifice financial stability and pleasure by abiding the safety rules against this pandemic -- and witness a breakthrough in about a year.

Practice hubris and recklessness by skirting the safety rules -- and suffer in darkness and collapse much, much longer."
2020-06-27 19:22,"US leadership is still doing nothing.  Trump and Pence refuse to wear masks although that plus social distancing are the two ways critical to stopping the spread.  Encouraging ""no mask"" rallies with no distancing is irresponsible but we know this administration thinks nothing of American lives.  Amazingly, it never enters their head that it is Republicans they are endangering the most.  And for Pence to claim that times are different than they were 2 months ago is baloney."

When (not ""if"") the Chinese Yuan replaces the USD as the reserve currency, inflation in the US will skyrocket. All of the debt Trump's fed is piling onto America's balance sheet has not gone unnoticed globally. This past week's selloff in the stock market is the tip of the iceberg.

Trump's incredible, unbelievable malfeasance is doing irreparable harm to the United States. We should not, we cannot wait for an election to remove Trump, Pence, Barr, McConnell and the rest of the conspirators.

I'd call it an interesting case of life imitating fiction, but that's simply not the case. The game is based on real functioning predictive disease models, and epidemiologists have raised the alarm about asymptomatic transmission since the days of Typhoid Mary.

Had the U.S. had a leader more interested in doing a good job, rather than worrying about the stock market and his reelection campaign, we'd be so much farther health-wise and economy wise. Heaven forbid someone can't pray in a building during a pandemic. What made it worse was the lies from the beginnings about masks being dangerous to wear. ""You might touch it and become infected yourself."" (Allegedly to preserve masks for healthcare workers.)  Had someone come out and said, hey, save the N95 and surgical masks for medical personnel, but cloth masks will do fine.  

Even worse, Trump & his cronies turned the wearing of masks into a political statement. You can, literally, tell someone's political standings by mask wearing. (Though, slowly, Rs are coming around.) The governors who prohibited the local politicians (mayors, etc.) from enacting mask mandates or lockdowns, should be jailed. The only reason they did that was to garner favor with the White House admin. 

The fact Trump, in the midst of a pandemic, held rallies & indoor political gatherings to further his campaign--while making attendees sign a health waiver to attend--infuriates me. They may have signed a waiver, but what of the people who didn't attend, family members & coworkers, and are now forced to interact with those people? They didn't sign a waiver. If they catch it, they should sue. I will never forgive Trump if one of my children get this."
2020-06-27 19:50,"If tope health authorities had agreed, in late January, that asymptomatic transmission was serious, at least tentatively, would it have made any difference?  Could the world have quickly shut down travel, make masks obligatory, and require testing, tracing, and quarantine of millions without tangible symptoms?

No.  Even now, after months of an expanding epidemic, we have not gathered sufficient epidemiological evidence to know the true scale or modes of contagion.  People bicker over the ""real"" extents of infection, severity, or mortality.  Asymptomatic transmission is plausible, but the practical implications overwhelm the public's will to believe or act, particularly if it entailed any indefinite span of mask-wearing, no group events, school shut-downs, or joblessness.  Good leaders might try to lead by example, but to decree containment measures would lead only to mass non-compliance, court challenges, or rebellion.  Look at how hard it is for governors, mayors, or even business people to get the general public to cooperate.   They can't fine or jail thousands or millions."
2020-06-27 19:55,"Symptomless transmission of the coronavirus is happening. We know that now. The question is, what do we do about it? At minimum, mask wearing in public should be mandatory everywhere in the US, by federal order and enforced with penalties, until it is clear that the infection reproduction rate has been durably driven below 1 and an effective test-trace-isolate program is operating nationwide. After all that we in NJ have been through already, I dread those full-capacity American Airlines flights coming into the Philadelphia hub from the southern and western outbreak states, bearing apparently healthy passengers with COVID-19."

I distinctly remember reminiscing about some black-and-white movie from the 50's - I believe it was a German one, can't remember the name, 45 years ago - that showed life during the middle ages in cities where the plague (Black Death) raged.

There was one scene stuck in my head, where a traveler comes to Cologne and reveals that he's last been to Munich. Everybody in the tavern panics and runs for the exits, because the plague was in Munich, but not Cologne. The traveler tries to assure some old guy ""...relax, nothing to worry, I'm fine, I don't have it..."". The old guy (doctor?) grabs his hands and checks them, than says ""...you don't have it, but you carry it...Look!"". In a dramatic cut the movie then shows dying rats in the corner of the tavern.

As said, that movie was from the 50's or even earlier. How can it be that we, in 2020, are so STUPID when it comes to asymptomatic spread of diseases?

I tell you how: because the scientists are scared! If they told the population what was _really_ going on there would be a total breakdown of social norms.

Other Covid-19 probabilities:

- Covid-19 will become like the common cold (also a Corona virus)
- but with a ~5% mortality
- and no long-term (>~60 days) vaccine or immunity.

Back in 2015-2016, the press collectively destroyed their credibility with all the “but her emails” coverage. And except for a couple of select journalists, none of them apologized for it or did any introspection whatsoever.

Most journalists, astoundingly, were resentful that most of the American public was upset at the incredibly deceitful and unfair framing of the 2015-2016 election. The press, as an institution, is no longer credible.

By the time the Covid 19 pandemic arrived, journalists were covering it, but the left was skeptical, because of the way the issue was being framed in major media outlets. The nature of the early coverage which was misconstrued as xenophobia was not helpful.

Also, in the last 5 years, conservatives have grown to ignore anything that doesn’t come from Trump’s Twitter feed. It was a classic boy who cried wolf problem.

The press, as an institution, has cried wolf so many times in the last 5 years that no one was listening when the wolf was really at the door. There are a lot of reasons the pandemic was mismanaged. 

But the reason the American public didn’t take the threat’s emergence seriously, is because the press has not done enough to show the world and Americans that it deserves serious consideration since 2015."

She tried to get word out, but her scientific voice was silenced by the scientific bureaucracy that contested a finding that they themselves could not claim credit for, as well as the WHO, other countries' health ministries, competing scientists. The Rothe team study was attacked as well because its implications were too politically difficult to accept. 

However, her study was based on a very small number of cases, very early in the outbreak. It was not unreasonable to subject the findings to close inspection.  We've seen what happens in the rush to publish early COVID findings that are not fully vetted or even fraudulent (reported well in NYT). 

Science is a collective effort to develop and disseminate validated knowledge.  Mistakes are made, important issues are missed. It is an unavoidable part of the process. Scientific methods are not infallible, but much better than myth and wishful thinking. 

Over time, knowledge advances -- if political considerations do not outweigh dealing with uncomfortable implications (like the need for lockdowns, economic disruption). On the positive side, the science around possible COVID treatments and a vaccine is progressing more rapidly than ever before."

We certainly reopened too soon, but the disaster we go through today is not just because of the timing. The timing just made it much worse very fast. Even if we had reopened later when the number of spreaders are lower, the number would grow back up pretty quickly, because this is a highly infectious disease. All you need is 1 infected person!

The approach should be reopening with lots of precautions, and certainly not so soon. Reopening of high-risk places such bars, restaurants, shopping centers and barber shops could be delayed a little longer than other businesses. Gatherings of large crowds could be prohibited for a long time, including political rallies despite the elections in November. Wearing masks could be mandatory in high risk regions and maybe even everywhere. With all those limitations, the R(0) value could be lowered to below 1.0, ideally to below 0.9, and then reopening would be safe. Despite the reopening, the number of new daily cases would continue to sink. We could live with such limitations until a vaccine and better treatments become available, and we would not have to go through such a big disaster today."

If everyone missed it, then no one caught it, not medical experts, not the Pentagon, not research universities, nor the CDC or W.H.O or even Bill and Melinda Gates...or George Soros or Henry (""World Order,"" his new book) Kissinger, even.  Not presidents from Canada, the UK, Germany, Norway, Russia, France, or Israel.  So unless you think politicians run around wearing a lab coat, stethoscope, thermometer and testing kits, the entire ""Blame Trump"" campaign now officially over.  A retraction, perhaps?"
2020-06-27 20:00,"Most government briefings have variants of the following words:

•stay home
•stop the spread
•save lives

Thing is, not all took these to heart.

The first responders and front liners of Spain and Italy were literally crying on camera begging everyone to stay home. 

As this is ongoing, the president of the USA was golfing.

And guess what?

He is still golfing this very second as the US is passing the 130,000 death count.

Unbelievable."
2020-06-27 19:33,"Ignorance by Trump, Pence, and Pompeo.  Careless by all the government staffs.  And helpless by the medical staffs."
2020-06-27 20:00,"As we all know, our ""Administration"" doesn't ""do"" facts. So are we surprised at the horrible response?"
2020-06-27 20:02,"One of the biggest problems in setting public policy is whether the experts are actually providing reliable information. When the infection first broke, the alarms sounding from the WHO, CDC, and other agencies created a panic. This in turn caused hospitals to be overwhelmed, not with critically ill patients, but with patients that could have remained home. Recall the dispatch of military hospitals and the erection of field hospitals in major cities. None served any purpose and were not used.
People, being fed inaccurate information by the gullible press, believed that the Wuhan Sars-Covid-19 was a fatal disease and everyone was going to die. However, if the ""experts"" had examined the data from 1968, when the Hong Kong Flu Pandemic hit the world, including the US, it would have seen that the infection rates were higher than normal, as well as fatalities to the same at risk groups. Then the disease was allowed to spread without shutting down the economy, closing schools, and causing mass hysteria. 
Our Health Professionals, aided by a irresponsible press, have caused irreparable harm to the economy and to the social fabric of the US."
2020-06-27 20:12,"For us here in Munich it was totally clear from the very first case at Webasto that the tramission happend from a person without symptoms. All the newspapers said so, everybody knew it. I can't even understand how that the rest of the world and the WHO had doubts about that."
2020-06-27 20:05,"The world did NOT miss COVID-19’s spread.

The experts knew, but Trump was in denial.

Future historians will regard this as the Trump Plague and the Trump Depression.  The millions of deaths and the trillions of dollars lost worldwide will be due largely to Trump’s narcissism and obsessive hatred toward Obama.

Under any past President of recent memory, America would have done much better.

Under President Biden, America will do much better.  It will take years to restore America, but with Trump gone we will at least have some hope.

There can be no progress in health, economics, or social justice until Trump leaves office in Jan. 2021."
2020-06-27 20:07,"Why is the NYT posting these blame articles?  No doubt to win over voters in the election.  Even I have changed my tune on the virus as new information has developed.  According to information published in the media at the time I didn't think it was much worse than the flu. I didn't think masks were that necessary, based on what was being reported in the media.  I thought the USA had indeed contained the virus to those few limited cases that had been intercepted at the airports with the people being isolated or hospitalized. But that was then.  Now we all know different. 
But then again, I have been in strict self isolation since December, not because I knew about the coronavirus, but because I was avoiding the flu that was expected to be especially bad this year. I studied infectious diseases at university. I did encephalitis surveillance for the local mosquito control district a few decades ago.  I have always known about symptomless spread of disease.  None of this surprises me. Back in the second week of March when I saw my doctor he said I should follow up in July, thinking the epidemic would have waned by then. I told him I probably would put off the appointment because I expected the virus would still be quite active, and it is. It's all very predictable. 
The media still thinks they can get away with this endless agitation in their quest for another Pulitzer Prize, or to win an election. 
The media, YOU, The NYT, are making things worse."
2020-06-27 20:28,"Unless the World was ready to go into lockdown 
On December 15th, it is hard to see how this could have
turned out any differently. 

One person on an international flight who had the virus
could have infected five people on that flight and those five people flying across America on Domestic flights could have 
infected 5 people each...

If Trump had ordered the Lockdown on December 15th would all
those who criticize him now had supported the LOCKDOWN ?

Once the virus was present in America, how many of us would have Self-Quarantined from that day until now ? Even now
when I went to local grocery I saw people without masks.

Younger people are going to Bars, others are going to Restaurants, there is some outdoor festival, that as far as 
I know has not been canceled for tonight.

Both the Governor and Mayor of New York mishandled the crisis.

Why assume that Politicians should have any great insight on how to handle pandemics ? There desire to quickly please people led to the too early lifting of the Lockdowns. The failure of the Senate to approve further stimulus bills will now make life much harder for your typical Americans. 

We need a National Board of Certified Epidemiologists who can 
invoke measures to contain any epidemics before they become
pandemics.

We all the medical devices, testing kits stored and reading to go
when an outbreak happens. Many people who were sick stayed home because there was nothing the Hospital, already overwhelmed could do for them."
2020-06-27 20:28,"As a physician I can see how this the course events unfolded. Medicine today is wedded to the concept of evidence based decision making. The problem is that a new disease requires making decisions with insufficient data, thus leading to paralysis. Factor in political pressures and you're on the way to trouble.

Medicine must become more adaptable in the face of ambiguity. It is not possible to wait for a sure thing."
2020-06-27 20:29,"The response to the emerging pandemic in the West contrasts very strongly with the response in China, Japan, Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong and the East generally.

In the West I watched with despair as the obvious LOGIC of asymptomatic transmission, the need for masks, the great danger of visiting or working in hospitals and care homes &c, was subordinated to  personal squabbles, institutional fights over 'territory', business pressure, political agendas - leading to a thoroughly chaotic mess, especially in Johnson's UK and Trump's dysfunctional US (later followed by another rightwing populist's Brasil).

Merkel's Germany did best among major Western nations by largely following the logic of the disease - Merkel, unusually for a political leader, was trained as a scientist, and Germans tend to be more systematic than many others, for better or worse - in this case much better.

Ironically, the greatest success story, after the initial mistakes by local politicians in Wuhan, was Xi's completely uncompromising top-down personal control of the challenge, based on a thorough, clear analysis months before all the confusion in the West.

Like it or not, coordinated top-down control, based on cool analysis of the logic of the disease and transmission, in Eastern nations with a culture of collective responsibility (best echoed by Germany in the West) produces far better results amid this global challenge than the fragmented chaos in rudderless US, UK and Brasil."
2020-06-27 20:32,"This is an excellent article of the sort that has been very rare these past several weeks. Rare, in the sense that the science isn't dumbed down and that it makes no effort to politicize, which I also appreciate. From this, I can draw my own very obvious conclusions about transmission. In my own neighborhood, a visit to the local park tells me that many people still seem to be unaware of how many people must be asymptomatic carriers."
2020-06-27 20:36,"Thanks for this.  It is very helpful to have all the bits and pieces tied together in a coherent narrative.  Sadly, egotism, self-importance still get in the way of scientific progress."
2020-06-27 20:48,"It seems to me that the primary culprit is China.  According to a new Rand Corporation study, China understated its reporting of Covid 19 caseload by a factor of 40.  That's right, 40.  Take what they reported and multiply by 40.  85,000 cases becomes 3,400,000.

In addition, it has been reported that surveillance satellites as far back as August of 2019 saw dramatic increase in traffic into Wuhan hospitals which only continued to rise.

These two pieces of data combined with numerous studies that show how tens of thousands of Chinese traveled by air out of China between August of 2019 to the curtailment of such travel strongly suggests that many more of these Chinese travels were infected than originally reported.  

So, the Chinese government knew they had a major problem as far back as August of 2019, decided to dramatically systematically understate the magnitude of the problem (ultimately by a factor of 40) and to support this policy of understatement, allow international travel well after the severity of the situation was known to them.  I think these three data points are at the center of what led to the world-wide pandemic we now have."
2020-06-27 17:27,it's easier to blame Trump.
2020-06-27 19:00,"I don't consider myself to be suspicious or paranoid, but I do tend to have a high sense of what George Lakoff [UC Berkeley] calls ""analogy-thinking"" --- which is why I sensed some confluence or seeming analogy between three ""Times"" articles this morning:

""Obamacare Faces Unprecedented Test as Economy Sinks"" [Abby Goodnough and Reed Abelson

""New Numbers Showing Coronavirus Spread Intrude on a White House in Denial"" [Maggie Haberman & Shear]

""For Boris Johnson’s Science Advisers, Pressure, Anxieties and ‘Pastoral Support’"" [Mark Landler & Castle]

All three of these ""Times"" articles focused in different ways, both domestically and overseas, on Coronavirus/Covid-19 (which I tend to call Covid-45, in honor of the Emperor) --- but none of these articles offered an option for 'reader comments' --- so I waited to see if the ""Times"" might offer another article like this one on ""HOW THE WORLD MISSED COVID-19'S SILENT SPREAD"" (all in CAPS, right down to the cap on the apostrophe in 19'S) --- strange, I thought, in that the ""Times"" doesn't like commenters using too many CAPS just for effect.

So, the bottom line, or what the TV media 'talking heads' might call ""the optics"" of some underlying possible 'analogy-thinking' started clicking in my strangely ""analogy-thinking"" brain --- which brought to mind 'so to speak' the question of what hidden factor might be teasing my mind --- and my only analogy thoughts were were these two, doublets: ""surplus people"" and ""wealth reform""."

2020-06-27 20:22,"One reason why ""the World"", the US whiffed on Covid19...is that the world's peoples, a fair sized amount of them, have been looking past their professional class, to their leadership class, and/or conspiratorial Cult leader class, for expert guidance in matters where expert professionalism is most needed. Public health being the most obvious case.

What Trump is exposing, among so many things, is how we the People, and even foreign nations, have been handing too much power over to the President. And not simply amping up what would be seen as traditional ""executive power"", but on penny-ante cr/p!

Its crazy how much is now on the plate of POTUS. Its absurd that the president is the gate keeper of supplies of PPE! Or that it would be classified as strategic supplies. I can grasp strategic oil reserves....but PPE? PPE is needed, by health professionals and first responders, when its needed, its not a strategic release, with market impacts like oil. 

Same with medical testing. Or any other such items and/or services that would be used in an emergency medical situations, such as a pandemic. Or with any other natural disasters.

That Governors would need to worry about appeasing any president to get PPE, or any emergency medical help, is ridiculous! 

We the People need to get really serious, as voters of many public Employees, by doing so with an eye towards building better functioning institutions. FEMA  is a dinosaur, fix or replace, then take it out from under DHS."

2020-06-27 20:49,"Perhaps  Dr. Camilla Rothe,  Dr. Merle Böhmer, and Dr. Michael Hoelscher – German  infectious disease specialists – deserve this year’s Nobel Prize of Medicine. Their unwavering conviction that people who appear to be infected with Covid-19, with the virus going unnoticed, can still be silent spreaders, was initially rejected  by foreign colleagues and the WHO. 
The Covid-19 pandemic has shed a negative light on the  health organisation, which has been accused of being beholden to China. Now it has become clear that its officials  had dismissed the risk of “symptomless transmission”, sending confusing signals to the world that seeks guidance. Precious time was lost due to their inertia.  
Dr. Maria Van Kerkhove, the WHO’s Covid-19 technical lead downplayed the German finding, and its emergency director, Dr. Michael Ryan, said on Feb. 27 that the significance of symptomless spreading was becoming a myth. With armchair experts like them at the WHO, no wonder an overhaul is urgently needed."
2020-06-27 20:49,This is a stellar piece of work by the Times -- outstanding fact-based investigative journalism that reads almost like a novel.
2020-06-27 20:24,"This is nuts.  The data is clear.  Over 80% of the Covid 19 deaths are people 75 years old and older.  OVer 94 percent of Covid 19 hospitalizations are elderly or diabetics and/or those with significant heart disease.  In addition, the human suffering collateral damage generated by the ""lock everyone down"" approach is mind boggling (according to the Brookings Institute over seven million new cases of childhood malnutrition with most of these kids now having lifelong learning damage, soreing domestic violence according to the US, etc.).

Why can't we protect the most vulnerable while letting the rest of our population keep the economy going and, thus, avoid the mounting human suffering collateral damage of a total lockdown?  The stats speak for themselves.  Quarantine the most vulnerable and insure those they come in contact with either are Covid 19 free or have the associated antibodies. This is not rocket science."
2020-06-27 20:26,"Yes, it's been proven, the coronavirus is spread by people who are suffering no symptoms. This is why young people, often symptom-free, can be unwitting carriers. With this in mind, wearing masks is imperative to protect one another. (Never mind that our POTUS _still_ is not wearing one.) 

What is remarkable though, is how this POTUS can't bring himself to tell the truth even when American lives are at stake. But then, we've come to expect as much from a man who deals in circus stunts: like using the Bible as a prop, bellicose grand-standing, and snake oil cures meant to impress dupes. No thanks Mr. Trump,  I think we'll listen to Dr. Fauci and the world's other health professionals and otherwise hold our noses."
2020-06-27 20:30,"Republicans ""miss"" lots of things.  I worked for the FDIC from 1989-2014.

They made it almost impossible to do a careful, thorough bank exam that truthfully reported problems.  They laid off or incentivized experienced staff to leave.  And one thing this situation has in common with both financial crises -- when a restriction works, the minute there's an improvement, Rs want to get rid of it.

We still don't have universal heathcare or sufficient wage replacement for people who are unemployed long term. We still don't have liveable wages. No one can survive on $7.25/hour. We still don't have affordable childcare, housing, or college. Americans can't afford to be healthy or live. This is caused by our admiration of uncontrolled capitalism, rugged individualism, and rejection of taxation. Democrats aren't the panacea. A totally different mindset and implementation of humane political policies is."

How is that even possible?"
2020-06-27 20:36,"Now months into this pandemic, we know that people under 40 years of age are unknowingly have COVID-19 and are asymptotically spreading the disease. We also know that large numbers of people are unemployed and need work. Protective N95 masks are still not readily available to anyone willing and able to purchase the masks and wear them in public. It would be great to see unemployed people get jobs manufacturing needed PPE, like N95 masks, that are in short supply. This would be a more productive use of government stimulus money than U.S. Treasury checks sent to dead people, or the wealthy 1%, who don't need the government assistance to survive."
2020-06-27 20:22,I guess 80% of people who die from Covid19 are over 75 and the average age of death is older than the average age of living in general.

2020-06-27 20:53,"This story has many interesting points.  However, as a scientist, the lack of recognition that Dr. Rothe got is one of the most important points of the story. Why? Because this happens ALL THE TIME. The scientific community is no so altruistic and squeaky clean as most people believe.  There are huge egos, public recognition, and power grabs at stake that occur all the time.  And you will rarely hear an apology or an ""I was wrong"". The consequences of this are beyond the recognition of Dr. Rothe, in this case.  Those that denied her credit also work very hard to bury the truth with the obvious consequences.  Everybody makes mistakes.  Public official in the US (including Dr. Fauci) deterred us from wearing masks for weeks and therefore, very likely amplifying the spread of the virus.  Has anybody heard an ""I was wrong""?"
2020-06-27 21:04,"I am a doctor have had my doubts about the spread of Covid since the Princess Carnival epidemic brought it to our attention. Medical evidence has been published (and ignored) that suggests the possibility that Covid might be spread through contaminated air recycling systems. That could easily be the thread for the outbreaks in cruise ships, nursing homes, conference halls, airplanes, prisons, meat processing factories and others that use similar systems. It is also the easy to evaluate further though possibly very expensive to correct. My experience is that not one public health agency, the WHO, or multiple state and county DPHs have been willing to either entertain or discuss this possibility. Even the research seems to have dried up. This is a very simple question to answer and one that we should be duty-bound to the departed to answer."
2020-06-27 21:11,"The United States needs a mandatory mask law, with police authorized to arrest and jail anyone not wearing a mask.  This pandemic is being prolonged and worsened by each and every American who refuses to wear one, and there will have to be stiff, nationwide enforcement of mask laws, given how we all refuse to behave ourselves.  No more pleading, no more cajoling; mask up or be taken to jail."
2020-06-27 21:08,"Regarding masks, here is a comment I originally posted 2/4/20. Needless to say I am pretty angry with my government.

The F.A.D. | The Sea
I have carefully read and reread all the mask articles. I still can't find a downside beyond creating a shortage where they might be more critical. I get the importance of protecting medical providers and that my risk mitigation by using one is quite minimal. However, if you have some available to use, what is wrong with decreasing risk but even a few percent? Specifically this is how I think about it: Currently,the odds of having an infected person spew enough virus on you for infection while riding the 7 train is statistically quite low to begin with. So most of the time the mask is wholly useless. And if it does happen, the mask is far from 100% protective because you could get it in the eye, the mask may have slipped off your nose, etc. *But* it could still work and at some point, the odds could go up. Starting with masks when infection is already rampant may be too late. And, if everyone masked up, including the virus shedders who are not feeling sick, how would that not decrease transmission? This of course assumes hand washing, etc."

2020-06-27 18:42,"A lot of heads should roll here. 

It is unconscionable how some of these medical ""authorities"" were so quick to fault others e.g. Dr. Rothe and Dr. Hoelscher, two appear to be true heroes now. And let's not forget the young Chinese doctor who was ignored by his government when he sent a warning of this coming pandemic.

Seems to me those early naysayers had the usual case of  professional jealousy so ready to find fault.  They should remember the Oath they took: ""Do No Harm"".

And the inexcusable mistakes went on from on high both in the global medical field of administrators to the bozo in the White House.

It sounds like N95 masks should be manufactured in massive quantities, distributed to everyone for free and required wearing IF you dare to go out.

Anyone who would even skim this article and claim as maskless Trump et al and his followers claim;"" this is a hoax"", "" it won't affect me"", ""i feel fine"", ""no one can make me wear a mask"" etc., 
their punishment will come.  Unfortunately, they take many others with them.

Finding individuals that made mistakes makes little sense.
During an epidemic, everyone has to act according to incomplete information. An epidemic is fussy. One should actively look for reliable information, though. But only at the end, provided we are still alive, we will know what was relevant: hand washing, mouth caps, avoiding elevators? 
 
Until that end, we can at least use common sense. Practice social distancing, lower exposure times, use mouth caps, do not end your private lockdown too early, avoid the herd, both in reality and mentally. 

It is clear that there are plenty of fools out there. People will make errors, sometimes in areas in which they are supposedly knowledgable, sometimes in areas in which they are clueless. Some people in power are obviously also clueless. Do not put too much faith in politicians or leaders of any kind. Be also always aware that you yourself may be mistaken.

Terrible and predicted things are happening at the time. Do not become upset: keeping cool, calm, and collected, as always helps.

We as a nation need to wake up from the Republican doldrums and know that every neighbor, every town, every state is interlocked with every other, and we cannot preserve our nation if we do not reject the damning advice that we might consider masking instead as part of that respect for life, respect rights of others in so many other ways.

2020-06-27 20:07,"It might be more effective for Dr. Fauci to help get his point across that COVID-19 like mumps is also a virus that can be spread by breathing in saliva droplets from an infected person who has just sneezed or coughed. While all side effects of COVID-19 have not been identified, one might remember that a side effect of mumps is known as orchitis, which causes one or both testicles to swell in males who've reached puberty. Orchitis is painful, but rarely leads to the inability to father a child (sterility).  One can only hope COVID-19 doesn’t have a similar side effect."
2020-06-27 21:44,"Although this article points out a lot of initial confusion and delays, this is the way science normally works. It takes time to conduct research, test hypotheses, corroborate results, settle conflicting interpretations, etc. 

The infectiousness and speed of transmission of this virus around the world outstripped the time available to get a handle on it. But as more findings become established, the world (and especially leadership in the US) has less of an excuse every day for failing to combat it effectively."
2020-06-27 21:46,"Political consequences of shutting down an economy, ostensibly to enforce social distancing advocated by infectious disease experts were being weighed during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. There are political consequences of face coverings. Early on, experts told politicians that masks were not needed, and besides, there was a severe shortage of masks in the country, in particular, the N-95 mask to be reserved for health care workers. State supplies of masks were either absent or expired. Federal stockpiles were insufficient to supply all the States that had neglected their own stockpiles. The issue of mandating masks soon revealed a push-back by the African American community as culturally offensive. One county in Oregon mandated masks for all white people but not Black because mandated mask wearing was deemed culturally insensitive. In Flint Michigan, a security guard was killed over face masks. Then there are the ""my rights"" people whom many have scorned publicly. However, the largest current population disregarding mask wearing are the youth, ages 18 to 35. The invinciples. Also in Michigan, 40% of people standing in line at a brew-pub became infected (few masks) and one of those individuals went home, had a large party whereby 30 people were infected from just this one person. Also notice the some people with masks, wearing them off the nose or on their chins, protecting nobody from silent virus spreaders. Its in the nose. Buy-in, not mandates."
2020-06-27 21:30,"THANKS to NY Times and the author for this very eye opening article!

We need to have a discussion about WHO operates, but still be funding them! Use the power from inside!"
2020-06-27 21:26,"She was like a modern Cassandra, who had the ability to see the future but was cursed by Apollo in that no one would believe her. It's sad that's the current state of the world--we have answers but we refuse to believe them."
2020-06-27 21:26,"Easy to jump on the bandwagon re the ""misleading and contradictory claims"" explored in the article. A companion article, today's ""Actual infections vastly undercounted, CDC data shows"" implies more misleading information.  Said CDC data are not counts, or the infections might not be undercounted;. they are projections from a CDC survey (about 12,000 samples tested for antibodies) that the number of infections (presence of antibodies) is 10 times the reported rate.  Further, ""NYC reported almost 54,000 cases by April 1 but the actual number was 12 times higher ...."" nearly 642,000.  

Never mind that what the article calls an ""actual number"" is a statistical inference.  At face value it seems like a good start on herd immunity and thus good news, especially considering that the actual numbers now - 3 months later - must be substantially higher.

The Times could do a valuable service by exploring questions like can one be a carrier and spreader without being infected (without having antibodies), are the antibody tests reliable, or what do the current statistics imply for likely new serious infections and hospitalization. Perhaps we might then avoid some of the blaming and not-so-helpful quotes like that of the good Dr., ""Many of us are sitting ducks...."""
2020-06-27 21:35,"The flip side is, little was achieved by shutting down.  The virus was already deeply endemic in the US by mid-March.  New York and New Jersey and Connecticut totally missed preventing their own outbreaks.  They suffered a hammer blow from the virus, before it apparently burned itself out.  

Plausibly, the virus is more infectious, more widely spread, and more benign than was believed (or assumed without data).  It did not kill 3 million people in the US, and was never going to.  At the maximum, it will kill (hasten the deaths of mostly terminally ill people comprising) 0.1% of the population - if it runs riot, like it did in New York.  That's bad.  But from a public health perspective, shortening the lives of 0.1% of the population by 1-2 years, temporarily (this will not be a novel virus in the future) is a small impact to public health, compared to things like obesity, alcoholism, smoking etc.  The main story here has been the immensely amplified and inflamed media portrayal.  I do not see evidence that people suddenly care about public health.  They never much did before.  They probably care even less about geriatric health.  So, this must be about some other combination of needs and desires."
2020-06-27 21:27,We missed it in large part because China first hid it and then exacerbated the spread. See infamous WHO Tweet of 14 January re no human to human transmission according to Beijing.
2020-06-27 21:53,"As a physician and a scientist (PhD in physiology), I think scientists think creatively but conclude conservatively; only after we have ""robust "" data which only comes after careful collection.  The Munich team was correct in posting the warning.  But without much data to collaborate the observation, it could not change the existing dogma.  China is faulted for mishandling the initial phase of the pandemic in Wuhan, citing that the government did not take the ""whistle blower"" seriously.  He was an ophthalmologist with no training in infectious disease.  And without adequate information, they  could not sound the alarm, hence the delay.  More importantly, Berlin initially rejected the early finding of the asymptomatic spread because it would have required a political solution that was unworkable.  While the epidemiologists focus on the medical consequences of the disease, it is the politicians who have to consider the other aspects of the society to formulate a policy that could be implemented.  It is acceptable to change policy as we learn more about an issue, as in this case the evolving knowledge of the spread of the virus.  The leadership should communicate with the people his/her rationale for the policy and that other aspects of the society have been taken into account.  This is after all, ""PUBLIC "" health.  The public have to buy in."
2020-06-27 22:12,"Here are the 2 big questions now in my view: 

First, why do some people in the same age group react so differently once infected with Covid-19? Is there a genetic predisposition to experiencing serious symptoms? Assuming two 40-year-olds  both had robust immune systems pre-infection, why does one end up on a ventilator and the other walk around asymptotic? 

Second, once infected can you be reinfected if you were asymptotic the first time?"
2020-06-27 22:18,"My first knowledge of COVID-19 was gained in January, about 15-16, 2020. I learned that it made human-to-human transmission by any mist--including breathing in conversation--for a minimum of 30 seconds. SARS-Cov-2 also survives on surfaces for up to 3 days.

All my actions since have been based on accepting these facts as a new standard of life. Rather than dither this way and that, parse and pivot or pretend to be intelligent and knowledgeable a thousand different ways, I would suggest that anyone who wishes to survive COVID-19 or help others do so accept this same reality."
2020-06-27 22:33,"We probably need cheap home testing kits with same day results so we can test ourselves weekly or more frequently to identify asymptomatic cases. That way, people can be in control of the results and take steps to isolate themselves immediately if necessary. 

It needs to be as simple as home pregnancy tests. But I have the feeling it will be a long time until that can happen."
2020-06-27 22:45,"COVID exposed a cascade of failures that goes all around the table on both sides of the political aisle.  Each leader in DC should be held accountable.  Impeachment hearings were not helpful while the virus was taking root and spreading, likely by random people getting on airplanes.  This country needed an effective pandemic response team to map out a course of action in January - what happened? 

We remain on the defense not the offense when it comes to managing this time of crisis.  People need to wear masks, social distance, stop going to parties, bars, restaurants indoors, large gatherings until we have proven therapeutics and a vaccine."
2020-06-27 22:53,"I think misleading statements or misunderstood statements cause a lot of confusion.  If 100 people are tested and 10 have the virus then it is 10%.  If 100,000 people are tested and 10,000 have the virus it is also 10%.  The press should indicate that part of the impact of the increased testing is that those who test positive should know to self-isolate so they do not spread the virus.  It would not impact them directly because it wouldn't matter if they were tested or not. The 90% were not directly affected so they might not care.
Another issue is that older people are more likely to be directly affected which will skew the percentages.  Somebody under 30 years old might not know anyone who has Covid-19 especially since many cases of those who have the virus and are under 30 show no symptoms yet can still spread the virus.  The key numbers published should be hospitalizations and deaths not cases."
2020-06-27 22:59,"I've heard literally hundreds of theories/solutions from doctors/politicians since mid February.Why haven't all US citizens been tested for both the virus and antibodies.I will never trust a politician again and am now extremely skeptical of what doctors say.Instead of second opinions,now it's time for third/fourth opinions."
2020-06-27 23:18,"Very interesting article. One problem is obvious: the implications of Dr. Rothe's conclusions were ominous to the point of predicting doom. So in some ways, it was impossible for them to be implemented.  It would have taken time to rule them in for sure; in the meantime, public pressure would have surged to rule them out. Any ""leak"" in the world drum could hardly be contained, although it's true that the world disaster might have been greatly diminished. 
Nevertheless, the world would have been required to lockdown in a week and cut off all travel instantly. Then, every country would have had to pass draconian public-dress laws and enforce quarantine. In fact, there were not even masks available for the health workers, to say nothing of the population. Then, those millions who'd been locked out of their countries would have had to be housed in foreign countries and treated, if necessary. Or, housed in vast buffer zones, as in Europe. Ultimately it was pragmatic health policy that prevailed, not science. Also, if people don't actually *see* the horror of this disease in their own city, they aren't afraid of the consequences and give up the will to stay home.  
With the major player, the USA, having no honest federal public health policy that didn't flatter Trump, and anti-science lunacies like ""inject bleach"" and ""take the sun"" coming from Trump, disaster was preordained."
2020-06-27 22:00,"Not only has our government dismissed it, denied it, misled us, minimized it, but a segment of our society has done the same thing. I just read a disturbing article in the Sacramento Bee about the surrounding ""rural"" cities. Some of these cities are not small and are fast growing in population. A large number of the population there are Republicans, they tend to be anti-government, they feel its their American right to do what they want, and they don't like Governor Newsom. For the most part they refuse to wear masks, they resent the infringement on their freedom, they minimize the severity and the spread of this virus. Selfishness, anti-science, and willful ignorance is prevelent everywhere in our country and this makes it difficult for the country to unite together in this crisis. And of course the President encourages all of this."
2020-06-27 22:44,"Shall we assume now that the ""world"" should have been more vigilant stopping the virus in its track because we could not trust Trump and his team?

How the world missed the silent spread is trivial. 

More important, we know how and why Trump missed it. He is still presiding over us despite his shortcomings as a leader; Pinocchio Pence keeps misleading us on the virus so something has to be done before more people die."
2020-06-27 21:48,"Every so often an article like this comes along that threads several needles into a tapestry of information.There have been several  nagging loose ends, unexplained  inconsistencies to much of the covid reporting and public health statements that have simply made no sense as the months have spooled out-until now. Mostly I am struck with the realisation that barring immediate global leadership, I do not see how the path of carnage of this disease in the coming 6 months will be any less tortuous than the past 6."
2020-06-27 22:06,"This is an excellent article. Until the final statement:  ""Dr. Rothe and her colleagues got a footnote.""

It is not a ""footnote.""  Her paper was cited at the beginning of the Results section. Her paper was cited by name and was included in the reference list.

That's why so many governments were reluctant -- and continue to be reluctant -- to react aggressively.  And I'm sure they considered the blowback they'd get if they overreacted and the virus turned out to be less contagious and lethal than we now know it to be.  Look at the abuse that health commissioners, governors, and mayors around this country are taking for doing the right thing in the face of all the evidence now available."

My hat's off to those who diligently worked to bring this story to light.

Why  so few seemed to grasp how unusual this was I have never figured out. Anyway, we sat around for seven weeks doing not much so there you have it."
2020-06-27 23:27,"The article illustrates the weaknesses and dangers of government run scientific, in particular medical, organizations. They are not independent and tend to bend the truth in order to appease the short term interests of the regime.

That's shameful and unfortunately contributes to some in the public discounting all advice from the medical professionals. (Someone I know believes this is just a flu, that the CDC info is fake, and that the death numbers are a huge exaggeration.)

 But what's worse is the uncaring, incompetent and downright dangerous response by the Trump administration.  They are responsible for the deaths of many Americans and the wasted sacrifice by all of us that has not tamped down the virus as a concerted and competent federal response could have done.  As a result, we're seeing big surges in several parts of the country and it's clear the virus is not done with us, though Trump and his lackeys want us to believe it's all over, folks.  It's all about Trump looking good, not the public health or what matters most to the country's citizens."

2020-06-27 23:36,"I hear people still questioning whether asymptomatic infected persons can transmit the virus, betraying their wish that the answer would be no.

The politicization by denial - first in China, then in the US - contributed to the confusion, and continues to do so.  At the same time, the increase in anti-science faith in the US for years has also meant that many choose what they want to believe anyway, regardless of facts or experts.

Gross mismanagement, most striking in the US, due to health care being a business first and thus ‘efficient’, ie money over health, along with the politicizing of public health, meant insufficient PPE, ventilators, test kits (the ones the CDC finally gave were faulty, while the US rejected those of the WHO) or hospital beds; the scarcity of masks alone led the CDC  (& encouraged by Trump) to claim they were unnecessary to avoid mass panic run, and confusing people now as they hear masks should be worn after all. Unlike Asia, much of the public also initially rejected masks to begin with.

Without any testing until recently, and no treatment in sight, people were (and are still) told to quarantine and take care of themselves - hence many more unknown cases, as well as deaths that were never identified as Covid cases-allowing the govt to say all is ok.

On top of all that, in this country more than elsewhere, when  ‘freedom’ not to wear a mask is perceived as more vital than protecting yourself and others, the battle for public health is already lost"

2020-06-27 23:24,"One thing that's been apparent to me from the start has been attempts by (mostly) red states and Republican politicians to normalize the virus; to approach it as something we just have to adjust to, tweaking our response as we go. The result of that mentality has been the quick reopening in states like Iowa, where Republican governor, Kim Reynolds, was slow to close the state in the first place and did so in a herky-jerky, piecemeal fashion. This has cost lives.

The thinking behind the openings in the face of the virus resurging is very simple and obvious: We're going to reopen, and whoever gets infected, gets infected; whoever dies, dies. Get used to it."

I also knew immediately from reading materials online that only an N95 would provide substantive protection, but already they were very hard to find.

I knew immediately that claims the general public did not need masks was a ploy to conserve N95s for health workers -- and I do not begrudge them. But I do not like being lied to by government.

The question: Why did I, just an everyday relatively intelligent person, know these things when the administration didn't?

2020-06-27 23:52,"Excellent article.  

It demonstrates that while expert opinion is always worth listening too, on any truly important matters only a fool will blindly follow what appears to be expert opinion.

Even experts can be wrong and experts can have different opinions.  If the experts are true scientists, they know this and will readily acknowledge it if asked.

It is the blind reliance on expert advice when one asks of them just  ""what should we do"" rather than further ask what do you know  to be true, what do you believe to be true, where might you be wrong and how would all of this affect what we should be doing? And then one should go to completely independent experts to get their opinions.

The ability of the virus to spread from those who have no apparent symptoms has made this virus much more difficult to control than was originally expected by the EXPERTS. It is not  just all President Trump's fault in failing to listen to the experts.  Where he failed (as he commonly does and in fact most of us do also) is in hearing what he wanted to hear.

We were deceived by what passed from the experts at the WHO and from the Chinese."
2020-06-27 23:59,"Sadly, the virus was being transmitted in the Wuhan area of China as early as November, and early December.  When doctors were reaching out to, and warning colleagues in other parts of China, as to what they were seeing, it was quickly squashed to the broader world media.  Finally, after those in the highly populated, and important industrial city, of Wuhan, whose auto companies are connected with Europe, had already, during the holiday season traveled to many places, including Europe, and the west coast, the virus was already circulating.  Watching the news, and being online, I was notified by my Chinese friend about what was happening on the ground in China.  When I saw that China said on New Year's Eve their time, that there was a very contagious virus going on, I didn't want to eat out that night in even a Thai Restaurant, in the Southwest, as I knew that those over in Wuhan had been traveling back and forth, between there and here, as well. My friend was very upset about Xi Jinping, and how he hid the virus from the world.  My two grandchildren have been in Chinese immersion since kindergarten, and all the teachers are from China.  She told me to tell them to be very careful.  My granddaughter was supposed to go to China for a short time in the beginning of March, but that trip was cancelled as well.  She was very disappointed.  It is difficult for teenagers when their life has been changed for a very long time.  The only hope for our mask less society is a vaccine."

2020-06-28 0:06,"Dear NYT:

A very detailed and readable explication of the limitations of science.  So much we did not know, until too late.  As it turns out, we could not simply ""listen to the data.""   

The good news:  The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ­have now esti­mated that the coronavirus kills about 0.26 percent of the people it infects (similar to a severe flu, such as the ""Hong Kong flu"" of 1968), or about 1 in 400 people. See <a href=""https://nypost.com/2020/06/25/getting-realistic-about-the-coronavirus-death-rate"" target=""_blank"">https://nypost.com/2020/06/25/getting-realistic-about-the-coronavirus-death-rate</a>/.

And, according to former NYT reporter Alex Berenson, new estimates from Sweden suggest that only 1 in 10,000 people under 50 will die from the virus, compared to 1 in 14 of people over 80 and 1 in 6 of those over 90.

And something like 80 % to 90 % of fatalities have involved so-called co-morbidities, i.e., their deaths had multiple causes, and many would have likely died soon in any event.  This is not soothing news for people who have lost loved ones, and I do not mean to diminish the value of any life.  (But I am one of the older guys, and would gladly die in placer of my children.)

So what does this evolving science tell us?  It tells us we can perform an epidemiological triage -- quarantine our most vulnerable until a vaccine is available, and allow younger healthier people to get back to a semblance of their former lives, thereby salvaging the world economy."

I know Chinese internationals who wore masks in public in Michigan in Feb/March and were screamed at in the streets.  A medical doctor wrote to our neighborhood listserv in April and told everyone not to bother, that there was no evidence masks worked and that masks might even spread the illness.

At this stage, I don’t think anyone has the science right.  I think surface spread and spread through food could be  way more common than we’re being told.  And little transmission at daycares and schools?  Come on.  That can’t possibly be true.

Use your head.  Stay home as much as you can.  Wear a mask.  Wipe down your groceries and anything else you bring in your house.  The virus is faster than the science."
2020-06-27 23:25,"We did not catch on very quickly to the danger of this virus and I don't think many understand how catastrophic this could be before its over. If you think leadership doesn't matter, Covid-19 is going to show you it does."
2020-06-27 23:44,"You know, when I think about it, it’s not that hard to understand why Trumpists can’t distinguish, “we have no clear evidence for,” from, “it didn’t happen.” 

After all, these are the same people who still insist that Robert Mueller exonerated Hizzoner.

And you can see why they latch onto what they think is the communistical suppression of dissent by an international organization and a secretive cadre of scheming mad scientists.

Half of it’s that they were scarred for life when they were little, and some fool showed them a pic of Joe McCarthy dancing with Hoover.

The other half is that as with so much else, they badly need to accuse everybody of what they’re doing. I mean, you see a lot of dissenting voices at your basic Trump rally? These are people who fly into a tizz if you mention that drinking bleach is a really, really dumb idea."
2020-06-28 0:09,The world missed it.  The doctors missed it. The experts missed it.  But let’s blame Trump anyway.
2020-06-28 0:07,Sorry but the world did not miss. The west did!
2020-06-28 0:18,"I have a new hero - Dr. Camilla Rothe. This young doctor did the right thing at the right time by providing critical information on the corona virus through the appropriate channels, only to learn that other health authorities were more interested in who got credit. We need more like her, especially those who haven’t been corroded yet by a system that wants us just to keep our mouths shut."
2020-06-27 23:38,"Excuse me Mr. Apuzzo but you are now engaging in the same level of scapegoating as Trump.

Individuals had a wide and deep pool on information at their very fingertips—anyone capable of posting a comment on this thread could have easily found for themselves reporting that warned of the potential of both aerosolized and asymptomatic spread."
2020-06-27 23:30,"Instead of ""Behind the Curve"", the lead-in could have easily read ... ""Hubris and Willful Ignorance.""

So well written, but gee whiz, this leaves me shaking my head as an epidemiologist.  The failures here are so terribly disappointing.  

And, so many are paying a grievous price."
2020-06-28 0:50,It is surprising to know that organizations like the W.H.O and other government-supported institutions were wrong at the beginning of the coronavirus situation. The fact that those organizations ignored when scientists warned the possibility of the spread of coronavirus even if people have no symptoms was just shocking. It is one of the main reasons why coronavirus was able to spread quickly around the whole world. If they listened to what Dr. Rothe and Dr. Hoelscher said than the situation wouldn't have gone this serious.
2020-06-28 1:26,"A very nice story.  Hind sight is 20/20.   What's really at fault is simply human nature.

First, we all need evidence to convince us to change our opinion or understanding.   And the stringency of the needed evidence is a judgement call.   Bias due to the circumstances can and does slip in when evaluating the evidence.

Second, it is human nature that when we came upon problems we tend to dally wishing it go away.   Again bias due to circumstances can slip inwhenassessing the magnitude of the problem."
2020-06-28 1:57,"Given how epidemiological science on SARS CoV-2 has advanced at a pace we’ve never seen before, I wonder if we’re demanding too much of it. Even had the results Dr. Rothe obtained had been made public advice immediately despite a then-considerable risk of it being wrong, neither Germany nor any other Western country was prepared to close borders and track everyone who’d had contact with a foreign traveler in the past month. None were ready to cease economic activity, order lockdowns and run mass testing in populations that would have to be supplied more masks than available at the time.

The virus was probably circulating throughout the developed world by the time China quarantined Wuhan. Certainly I think we could have acted faster than we did, the bungling nowhere more evident than in the Trump Administration’s ostriching its head into the sand. But compare what was done in 2020 to the policy of letting pandemic respiratory viruses run their natural course awaiting vaccine we used in 2009."
2020-06-28 0:42,"That is the biggest problem with this virus, M ost people that have the virus don’t know that. And then they pass the virus to others and they don’t know it too. Suddenly we have millions of people that have the virus and aren’t sick. The hospitals have plenty of bands. Nothing is happening. What are we going to do?;//"
2020-06-28 0:36,"I remember when the Chinese businesswoman without symptoms infected the Germans. The NYTs covered it and raised the alarm but then and others were dismissed as chicken littles. I am glad they are now calling out the world’s pluralistic ignorance and normalcy bias. The world is full of poisonous snakes. We should learn how to turn rabbits into honey badgers.

We are still incredibly lucky. The world did act and we may have prevented hundreds of millions of deaths. That is a success.

I would also like to see people use gloves in addition to masks in public. We still must buy enough time to develop a vaccine. I hope the NYTs runs an article with the same tone as this but highlighting the efficacy of widespread PPE use. In particular an analysis of areas with and without mandatory PPE. 

If we can change our culture towards biodefense and widespread PPE use then we may be able to weather any future pandemic. It could be as simple as wearing an extra piece of clothing or using indoor UVC lights. If only global warming and nuclear war could be eliminated so easily."
2020-06-28 0:53,"Here in Canada Dr. Teresa Tam insisted masks were not necessary for far, far, too long, even in the face of contradictory evidence, and claimed asymptomatic transmission was not a “major factor in the virus’ spread.” This was really because of a PPE shortage, I fear. She has close ties to the WHO. I have a PHD, heartily believe in science, and am not prone to  conspiracy theories. But from week one even I could tell asymptomatic spread was happening in travellers to and from Wuhan. This whole thing has been a giant debacle, and the deaths of thousands could have been prevented (especially here in Canada’s ravaged care homes) by a little common sense. I’ve been isolating (it is a privilege I know) and angry at the world since March. The end is far from sight."
2020-06-28 1:04,"A question:  Back when Wuhan was in the waning phase of its big surge, and Italy was becoming the epicentre, Iran was hit particularly hard. Why? Is there a lot of business travel between China and Iran? Or Italy and Iran? Italy makes sense as a huge tourist destination. But Iran? I'm not suggesting some kind of conspiracy theory. Just wondering if there is something about the flow of air travel to and from Iran that I was never aware of.
Anyone?"
2020-06-28 0:42,"Imagine if this had the 50% average mortality rate that Ebola has? The death toll right now, in the United States alone, would be over a million plus.

The point being: we had better learn from our mistakes now, otherwise, the next time, and there will be a next time, we may not live to see the next ""next time"".

All things considered, the prospects of us doing that are extremely thin.

I can just imagine Trump winning, and someone saying, ""Mr. President, now that the pandemic has past, what should we do with all these ventilators?"" To which Trump would reply, ""Pitch 'em! We're never going to need those again!""

""Then again, save one for me... just in case!"""

I am in the vulnerable age group, but without any stated underlying conditions (occasional elevated blood pressure managed by diet, and medically managed thyroid issue) that would make me more prone to a serious case of the virus
I am wondering how the total case numbers will change when others in a similar situation to mine, who will finally access the antibody testing in weeks to come.
Was I asymptomatic weeks ago, or did I dodge the virus bullet so far? How many others are thinking the same thing and when will we all finally be counted?"

2020-06-28 2:12,Here’s my guess what’s happening.  Most of us carry an inactive COVID-19 virus.  But something triggers the virus to be active and we can infect others by triggering their inactive virus.  Some people’s inactive virus cannot be switched on.  Some people’s virus can be switched on but nothing happens.
2020-06-28 2:25,"Yes,
the ""world"" missed the silent spread.

That includes dozens of countries --
not just the USA.

Per capita --
which is the only sensible way to compare countries
with widely varying total populations,
the USA is not at the top of either cases or deaths.

Sure,
the USA could have done better,
but so could dozens of other countries.

And sure,
the USA could do better now.

But fighting the virus involves many trade-offs,
and the world's various countries are each weighing the trade-offs in different ways.

Sweden -- that supposed paragon ""civilization"" --
has made an interesting decision regarding trade-offs.

Also, many, many factors affect the spread.

The main factor is space --
social distancing.
Social distancing is certainly easier to practice
in places with lots of space.
Countries with lots of space have suffered less --
Canada, Russia, Australia.

Cold itself does not necessarily foster the virus itself,
but it forces people indoors, even in countries with plenty of space.

We'll see what happens in Canada and Russia this coming winter.

Extreme heat can also entice people indoors,
at least where there is plenty of money for plenty of air conditioning --
like the Persian Gulf --
or maybe Arizona, Florida and Texas???

Mobility also spreads the virus.
In general, ""advanced"" countries have far more mobile populations than ""developing"" countries. Doubtless that mobility is one reason advanced countries have significantly higher COVID rates than developing countries."
2020-06-28 2:29,"When your conclusions match what you want to be true, it’s usually wise to take another look or exercise some caution anyway if you’re dealing with a lot of unknowns. Seems like very few people did this and the vast majority are making the same error even today."
2020-06-28 3:10,"Very interesting article; highlights the egos, infighting and backbiting so typical in academic/institutional science.  Doctors Rothe and Hoelscher are the pragmatic scientists on the front line trying to sort things out and to alert the world about the real issues (like Doctor Li in Wuhan, who was savaged by CCP operatives for trying to warn about human-to-human transmission in December.)

The e-mail database you put on-line with your ""Red Dawn"" story shows many e-mails, especially from Dr. Eva Lee, thinking about asymptomatic transmission given the German case, but also the Diamond Princess and stories coming from China by the end of January.  All agreed it was very scary, but given the problems getting tests at that moment, noone knew how to deal with it."
2020-06-28 3:45,"Many people are not realizing that at this moment 500.000 people died from a viral infection in a very short time.

People are thinking that a rational approach to assumed risks makes one saner and less scared. 

What is the risk of 3% death and 10% disabled? 

If they think that is okay. 

Then 

Good luck. 

underlying scientific discussion is not abnormal or caused death. Alarming early was the right thing to do but most likely resistance to extreme caution will be much fierce too.

The restaurants are open in New York, I saw many people are starving, they were in a famine last 3 months, not pandemic. 

We are all going to suffer and no one can do anything about it."
2020-06-28 4:16,"Excellent article and kudos to Dr. Rothe and Dr. Hoelscher. 
I remember seeing an automotive news flash about the first German case on Jan. 27th. I looked up the local German news to get more details and read about that the visiting person had not shown any symptoms. After that I was convinced of the possibility of symptom-free transmission. 
We (the west) should have followed the likes of Taiwan, S.Korea, Hong Kong and New Zealand.
The initial global spread was via business and personal travel by people usually with good or excellent health care. Sadly it is now spreading through the masses of less fortunate people with no or poor health care and limited means to protect themselves. Its astonishing to see how many in the ""West"" doesn't protect themselves with face masks, avoiding bars and other places where close proximity is unavoidable. Unfortunately its going to get much worse."
2020-06-28 7:10,"This is an aside, but one thing I found penetrating my consciousness while reading this and other articles about covid-19 is the number of women scientists involved in important research and findings.  And remembering Lawrence Summers' very unscientific remark that women can't do science."
2020-06-28 7:21,"Thanks for this article. Unfortunately it confirms my assessment that health authorities (""even"" German authorities) intentionally tailor their statements to fit the political agenda of the day, regardless of the truth. 

I suspect that this is costing lives, because nobody trusts them anymore, and doesn't listen to sound advice because nobody can tell the difference."
2020-06-28 8:12,"Very good piece, thank you. We were indeed too naive in the early days, certainly in Europe. Part of the problem is the lack of communication on the illness in the early days, the problems in the governance of the WHO, and the functioning of the international scientific community (as rightly described in this article). This points to the need of much more international cooperation, a much stronger WHO, and interaction with the international economic policy cooperation. We need a Global Public Health Council, like the Financial Stability Board that was created after the financial crisis in 2008, to coordinate amongst all the entities and countries involved, and have a common response."
2020-06-28 8:49,"It is not about ""symptomless"".  Every Virus or Sickness generally, have its symptoms. 
Just, 14 days of incubation of Virus makes it more difficult; especially when basic Rule for testing is ""those with symptoms, only""."
2020-06-28 9:30,Excellent article. Covid-19 is new and different. Due to this there were initial assumptions made that were incorrect which is very understandable. The biggest problem is that too many people in positions of authority or influence failed to understand that as more information is gathered that old assumptions become obsolete.
2020-06-28 9:32,Thanks for an excellent and beautifully written and illustrated story.
2020-06-28 9:59,"Great and important article, but what I would like to know is: do these study make the distinction between ""pre-symptomatic"" and ""a-symptomatic"". To what extent did the presumably infecting patients develop symptoms? If the phenomenon is actually one of ""pre-symptomatic"" as opposed to ""a-symptomatic"", can we assume that children (notably grandchildren), who appear to be largely a-symptomatic are by-in-large not silent carriers. I read an article recently that the thousands of  children of front line workers, who were provided group child care when schools were shut down, have not been systematic spreaders of the disease."
2020-06-28 11:13,Thank you to the NYTimes team that wrote this excellent article.   Dr. Rohde deserves the Nobel Prize in medicine for her work and the courage to follow the truth.
2020-06-28 11:28,"Academics and scientists are just as human as the rest of us when it comes to being competitive, even pettily so.   Careers are made and broken on who discovers first so much so that the larger context of contributing to humankind is ignored or given a back seat.  This episode is sadly another reminder of our ways and their enormous costs."
2020-06-28 11:45,"The journal editors bear some responsibility for this mess. Here is an example of how the scientific publishing industry could not adapt quickly enough to a new role: the rapid vetting and dissemination of useful observations in a crisis.

Dr. Rothe's observation was, of course, limited. She described a single patient. But it was still as accurate as Dr. Rothe's team could make it under the circumstances, and certainly worthy of publication. Almost anybody reading that paper would understand its limitations.

The Robert Koch Institute results were in the same sort of situation. They had a little more time, a few more patients, and a slightly different hypothesis about how the virus spread. That paper, too, was worthy of publication. But the editors were all wrapped up in whether it was a new result, or not. They were worrying about scientific priority, not truth. They should have published the second article too. They could also have published an editors' note reminding readers of the fog of the war on the virus (as if their readers needed to be reminded).

Big Science, in the fields covered by Nobel Prizes, has become too much like a horse race: first past the post takes the trophy and the victory lap in Stockholm. Journal editors see themselves as the judges of that horse race. Maybe, after this experience, they will rethink that role."
2020-06-28 11:49,"There seems to be two other pandemics at work - fear of appearing to be ""wrong"" and manipulative official statements.

Waiting until something is known for sure to make policy decisions is often like building a giant pot in a poker game then folding for one last bet after the evidence is overwhelming the someone else has better cards. It is better than the worst option, but miles from the best.

It is ok to be overly cautious when the stakes are high even if it increases the chances of being ""wrong"". It is costly but can be overcome, while some mistakes have permanent consequences. Knowing which mistakes to make is often much more important than how many mistakes are made."
2020-06-28 12:02,"The Federal Government has to step up and offer to make everyone whole as we sit out the virus waiting for cures and vaccinations to come along. 

The Feds should be picking up our tabs so that we can continue to live the lives we are accustomed to living. No windfalls for anyone and fraud should be severely prosecuted. Those who can work should, of course, continue to work. 

We currently need essential services. We don't need 2,424 $$210 million F35 aircraft, or submarines or any of that other stuff now. We need THIS!

When the crises is over we should reward essential workers like medical personnel, police, food providers, postal workers, and others with a one or two year exemption from income taxes to show the Nation's gratitude."
2020-06-28 12:23,"Personally, I'm more puzzled by the early discouragement regarding mask-wearing. I realize there was very limited PPE at the time and that officials didn't want people to feel a false sense of invulnerability. But no one feels invulnerable wearing a mask. They feel like they're in a dystopian film living out the last days of their lives.

Had they presented the public with a hard choice, either 100% compliance regarding masks or we're going to close the economy, people would have masked up overnight. As it was, they went about their essential needs, standing in lines, buying groceries – and often essential work – still without masks, and the virus continued its slow burn.

It seems to me irrelevant whether there's asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic spread. If 100% of the public masked up, they would have stopped the spread regardless. Instead they closed the economy and got masks wrong, and here we are."
2020-06-28 12:48,"This fascinating article also points out to one other thing. The review process in academic journals is seriously flawed. First, the gate keeping role of the editors and anonymous reviewers is not necessarily objective. Their own political ideologies and agendas play a role in what is published. Second, in the publishing world, to get something published in a major journal you either have to be the first to find something or you have to vehemently discredit the previous research. Finally, the subtleties of academic research is lost in a sound bites world."
2020-06-28 12:54,"Truly extraordinary reporting this is.  Thank you NYT.  Nothing in any way shape or form can exonerate the Trump administration or our national government from the dismal manner in which they have failed to lead in this area.  That said, this report confirms without a shadow of a doubt how broken not just the US but our global health care delivery infrastructure has become.  Just as troubling, this shows that the credibility and reliability of scientific and medical publishing has been compromised as well, thanks in no small part to private sector competitive and academic machinations.  Wish this were a relatively simple matter of having heads roll at WHO, which is most surely justified.  This is a public and private sector morass of the first order with truly worldwide implications.  The fact that we really have no country on earth right now that much of the world trusts enough to lead doesn't help."
2020-06-28 12:55,"From the beginning there was no clear consistent message as to how to respond to this Virus. Here in NYC our Mayor and our Governor was telling us their was no imminent danger and then suddenly locking us down.
The most vulnerable in the Nursing Homes and tightly populated communities in the Bronx, Queens and Brooklyn didn’t get special focus.
But to me the most important issue the still to this day isn’t talked about is that for the majority of Americans this is not a deadly disease.
For most they will have a mild case or none at all.
If the reports are accurate that the infection rate might be 10xs higher the stated it proves how poorly our health and Government leaders responded."
2020-06-28 12:57,"How could we miss the silent spread of the virus?  Our government officials simply just not trust China. Whatever the news coming out of China, we either criticize the action or play down the significance.

When China took a draconian measure of Wuhan lockdown over 11 million residents, we criticize their infringement of liberty.  We will never do that.  We don't think it is serious nor significant.  We just stop flying there or let them coming here. And Trump laughed at these viruses that one day it will magically disappear.

When China expanded the lockdown to the whole province of more than 22 million people a few days later.  We laughed again at their misery.  But no government officials thought that it was serious enough and we needed to do something.

In the meantime, there were several paper published in the British Lancet, a reputable medical journal, to announce the significance of this viruses, but we didn't pay attention.  But other countries took note especial Germany.  People's lives are at risk.  Germany is serious and work hard to prevent it.

We let this to happen.  Virus didn't spread without notice.  We just think it won't happen to me."
2020-06-28 12:59,"The average age of people who die from Covid19 is older than the average age people die in life in general. Asymptomatic transmission from otherwise healthy people remains either ""very rare"" or, at best, uncertain, or based only on conjecture , anecdote and doleful prognastation (this article). For these two reasons, it's really hard for most people to see the logic in staying home and not working and taking these precautions."
2020-06-28 13:02,"It's not brain surgery. Universal Basic Income, leave the medical professionals (not politicians) in charge of decisions, and lockdown for a FULL 90 days. Instead of a trillion dollar windfall for billionaires, create fat bounties for researches who develop a vaccine. So that they will PERSONALLY be rewarded, even if their employment contract guarantees all profits to their Big Pharma employer."
2020-06-28 13:08,"The simple truth is that quite a few scientists did not question their key assumptions and forgot about the precautionary principle. Of course many of these scientist did so to try to avoid a panic. However, once the first evidence appeared to indicate the possibility of asymptomatic transmission, many entrenched themselves in their current theories (due to pride?), instead of taking a few minutes to think, ""what are the implications for this virus if asymptomatic transmission is indeed possible?"" Perhaps many did ask themselves this question, but were too scared to face the possibility!"
2020-06-28 13:10,"The time for the US to have gotten its pandemic preparation and messaging (ex., on masks) in place was right after the last pandemic (H1N1), which infected over 60 million Americans.  We missed that window.

Real pandemic planning would have required a total transformation of our testing process.  It would have moved the manual testing process away from the FDA, which initially was doing all testing, and into local labs.  It would have set up a national network of labs to perform testing and prepared them for receipt of a genome, after which they could begin testing immediately.

This is a years' long process.  It took South Korea years to do this.  Perhaps we'll learn this time."
2020-06-28 13:24,"One thing this article inadvertently does is to lay bare the expression 'Trust Science' for the ruse that it is... Science is malleable, transitional and fallible. Clearly some scientists 'knew' things they we uncomfortable saying they 'knew' because they could not prove it in a conventional scientific framework.  

The early semantics back-and-forth is a chilling exchange with lives at risk. The lies about the mask-wearing also are finally laid bare. Yes. Fauci lied to us to make sure there was masks enough for heath professionals. We could have gained up something else to wear but instead he lied to us."
2020-06-28 13:25,"Most interesting to me, is that this is a tale of evolving forms of expert knowledge. The pieces were in many minds justly waiting for an authoritative voice to make the conclusion about asymptomatic spread.  How long will we gargle this finding before we spit out the fact that asymptomatic spread means it is  harmful to reconvene the young in face-to-face schools and universities? While all societal groups should use distance, dispersion, and masks to prevent spread, we would be quite confused to allow this crowned virus to enlist our children as soldiers against their own society."
2020-06-28 13:33,"So this medical crisis was exacerbated by public health officials who then convinced politicians to engineer an economic crisis to cover their tracks. I hope they recognize that the correct steps in the future are:
1. Allow private companies to develop and disseminate tests widely after quickly being certified.
2. Encourage testing by publicizing symptoms.
3. Impress upon people the efficacy of wearing masks for their own safety, not just that of others.
4. Ask businesses to close for a minimum of two weeks while they develop safe re-opening plans.
5. Send everyone $1000 or so to boost the economy.

Instead we had nonsense about saving masks for Healthcare workers, bending the curve, shutting down businesses indefinitely, etc."
2020-06-28 13:33,"Fascinating article and great reporting that gives much more nuance to the history of how we got where we are. So important to listen to doctors and nurses who are on the front line of disease. My dad (who was a doctor) used to say that as we get more scientifically and technologically advanced, we are in danger of forgetting importance of the “art” of medicine."
2020-06-28 13:38,"Australian state health departments are responsible for testing, contact tracing, infection tracking, and isolating. The federal government is responsible for regulation and coordination.  The pandemic has revealed some overlaps and gaps that need fixing - aged care homes and cruise ships being the two obvious ones.

But the key factors to Australia's low infection and death rates were: Early, decisive and coherent action by federal and state governments and closing international borders and detaining returnees in quarantine for 14 days.  Testing, contact tracing, infection tracking and isolating capacity would have far less effective, if not overwhelmed, if those key factors not fallen into place.

The challenge now is to hang onto the coherent decisive mindset across federal and state governments - and preventing interstate squabbles degenerating into mud-slinging civil wars."
2020-06-28 14:03,Much of this 'data' is based on modeling.  I thought that some of the more recent data based on contact tracing showed that asymptomatic spread is much lower than the models suggest and that was the impetus for the WHO recently stating that asymptomatic spread is rare.  When real world data doesn't support the model the model is wrong.  Right?  Seems contact tracing would be the gold standard of data.
2020-06-28 14:24,"Transmission of a virus is a one way street, that's why it's called ""transmission"". People who are not infected do not just pick it up out of nowhere; they must come in contact with someone who is infected. This is an important distinction because it lies at the heart of the ignorance that claims if I'm not sick, or not showing any symptoms of being sick, then why should I have to wear a mask? In this view of the world I'm not concerned with how my behavior impacts others but, instead, am only concerned with how I am impacted.

This is a serious problem, one that speaks to the every-man-for-himself attitude we seem to take with almost everything, from health care to education to, now, a pandemic. This attitude poses casually in our behavior, not as overt disregard for others, but as a shrug of the shoulders --- if old, vulnerable people die from this, it's not my problem, as long as I don't catch it. This attitude, combined with the aforementioned ignorance about how transmission works, leads us to search for information that confirms our personal safety: Am I part of a vulnerable group? When can I go back to gym or out to eat? Does a mask really help keep me from catching the virus?

As long as the focus remains on what is best and safest for me, we will continue to regard  ""transmission"" in the exact opposite way necessary to stop the spread."
2020-06-28 14:41,"There seems to be a need for a new category of asymptomatic. Those with no outwardly detectable symptoms but feel off and those without outwardly and self detectable symptoms. The article seems to imply that the contagious ""asymptomatic"" people felt ill and did not report it."
2020-06-28 2:25,"Our greatest fallacy is to believe our science is powerful enough to stop nature.

Despite extremely sensitive PCR testing, gene sequencing allowing the family tree of COVID to be traced, and electron microscope images of the virus attacking a cell, our understanding of germ theory still seems pretty 1900's with very basic questions of infection path being, at best, a guess. 

On top of that, cheating death still seems far from the grasp of science. While you can blame you favorite political figures, I accept a reality that we are mostly just along for the ride on this one - we can stop this virus no more than we can stop an earthquake. 

While Sweden is talked about in terms of the cost of riding it out, no one is talking about India (where I get a first-hand accounts via co-workers in Pune), where despite some of the earliest and most aggressive lock-down, the case rate just continues to rise. 

 Carpe Diem."
2020-06-28 11:11,"""Never underestimate the power of denial"".  This is a quote from the film American Beauty.  We can not ""beat"" this virus.  Humans are not used to being in such a predicament, and the concept that we simply can't control this is unacceptable to the minds of many.  The pattern of spread and resurgence that is now occurring seems to have nothing to do with patterns of societal closing and reopening.  The results of these actions are all over the map. It is an act of nature and will run its due course.  The extent and duration of social isolation required to stop the spread of COVID-19 is simply fundamentally incompatible with the construct of modern human civilization.  We need to take reasonable precautions, go about out business, and then humbly accept the hand that Mother Nature has dealt us."

Science is only as good as the ability of the scientist to manage the flaws of human psychology, the ability of the public to be intelligent consumers of expert opinion, the ability of news organizations to review expert opinion, and the ability of the country’s leaders to lead. As this article helps us look in the rear mirror of the actions of the world’s scientists we need more of this and a collective autopsy that further encompasses the behavior of citizens, news organizations, and  politicians.  We have much to learn about the courage it takes to get it done right. To imagine that we needed a lock down or to intrude on our freedom with contact tracing takes courage."
2020-06-28 12:22,I’m baffled by this article and the comments. I have been fully aware of and convinced of asymptomatic spread since early March.  I have been railing against the pointlessness of temp checks and the like this whole time. I thought this was general knowledge.  Baffled.
2020-06-28 11:10,"While some have continued to defend the WHO, I'm glad the article highlights the China-bent of the organization, going so far as the credit the Chinese for the German's ID'ing the possible asymptomatic transmissions.   And the WHO continues to dispute the amount of such transmission and to disseminate questionable recommendations.

I hope people also recognize the lack of clarity from the medical community, it's fumbling medical guidance and the baffling bad care (put every seriously infected person on a ventilator to basically die) are nothing to be proud of.  American ""experts"" for the most part saw no serious issue until mid-March, and even then it was qualified."

The reality is much different.  Each year millions are infected with the flu.   CDC estimates that the burden of illness during the 2018–2019 season included an estimated 35.5 million people getting sick with influenza, 16.5 million people going to a health care provider for their illness, 490,600 hospitalizations, and 34,200 deaths from influenza.

The overall burden of influenza for the 2017-2018 season was an estimated 45 million influenza illnesses, 21 million influenza-associated medical visits, 810,000 influenza-related hospitalizations, and 61,000 influenza-associated deaths

While liberals ridiculed conservatives for not following the science and experts, most understood that we will have to let the virus run its course.  Many will suffer, yes, but we can not beat Mother Nature.  But we can save our economy and get on with our lives."
2020-06-28 13:10,"I suspected something was off the instant I read US government advice to citizens to 'stop buying masks'. The tell was in the rationale: 'If we all buy masks there will not be enough masks for emergency and medical personnel who really have to have them'. That was disingenuous at best. I always keep a box N95 masks in my workshop to use when sanding, etc. I've been wearing them ever since.

And I am skeptical the widely-disseminated  notion that masks don't protect the wearer,  they only protect other people. If a mask can protect against particles going out, why can it not also protect against particles coming in? This too could be a little white lie told to depress public demand for masks while authorities scrambled to supply masks to emergency and medical personnel. They could have said simply, 'Don't buy masks. There aren't enough for even emergency and medical personnel.'"
2020-06-28 13:36,Almost all the 'measures' recommended by the government were made up as they went just so they could have something to say and pretend like they were governing.
2020-06-28 14:48,"This is nuts. The data is clear. According to the AMA over 80% of the Covid 19 deaths are people 75 years old and older.  Over 94 percent of Covid 19 hospitalizations are elderly or diabetics and/or those with significant heart disease. In addition, the human suffering collateral damage generated by the ""lock everyone down"" approach is mind boggling (according to the Brookings Institute over seven million new cases of childhood malnutrition with most of these kids now having lifelong learning damage, soreing domestic violence according to the US, etc.). Why can't we protect the most vulnerable while letting the rest of our population keep the economy going and, thus, avoid the mounting human suffering collateral damage of a total lockdown? 

The stats speak for themselves. Quarantine the most vulnerable and insure those they come in contact with either are Covid 19 free or have the associated antibodies.  Even the WHO now says that some form of the Swedish model may needed given that the vaccine might take a few years to successfully develop (remember, the vaccine development world's record is 5 years).

This is not rocket science."

In a world that can LIKE and SHARE instantly, enjoy the same seasonal foods we like - year round, ordering and obtaining anything under the sun the next day, but we can't cooperate  apolitically about a deadly virus.  Covid -19 is wake up call: cooperate, share, and trust.  Nationalism, suspicion, and ego do not and will not serve the world well.  Most of us now see the folly of this approach ih medicine and many other fields.  Will we insist on selecting intelligent leaders that trust science and act for their nations while cooperating with others?

It may be just a few weeks before we close up again, this time for maybe good. No PPP loan will help survive this or look attractive, the future of restaurants seems bleak after reading this and digesting the reality. Leadership from the top is essential, unfortunately we have none at this moment in time. Yes we can blame Trump for his inaction and continued ignorance.

2020-06-28 10:13,"I do feel confused about a couple things. I was in China when it really took off and a lot of this was known by the general public very early on. I don't understand why the West felt it needed to figure it out for itself and then claim China didn't share enough info. It was in the public domain, there's Western journalists there. I think this article also demonstrates that China was not alone in concealing the seriousness of the virus. Most countries did that - a weird denial that seems to continue months later, as though corpses aren't evidence. I also am confused because was always told as a teacher (b/c we get sick a lot) that most colds and flus are contagious before you have symptoms. And, blatantly, people experience them in different levels of severity. So, why is this even so surprising or worth debating. It sort of baffles me. Its like wearing masks - cost/benefit analysis. If being cautious turns out to be wrong you lose a lot less than being wrong about overconfidence and complicity."
2020-06-28 10:48,"Less nitpicking, more humbleness and more concern about being conservative with the unknown would have helped. Couple this with a general lack of leadership, especially in places like the Us and Uk and we have the makings  of a medical disaster."

2020-06-28 7:40,"Excellent article. My reaction in January was to start wearing a mask and to be cautious, figuring by the time we get the “data” and “evidence,” it would be too late—if pre or asymptomatic spread was occuring, by the time we had hard evidence the spread of this virus would be beyond our abaility to control, and there would be absolutley nothing we would be able to do about it once that happened. I have a science background—engineering and statistics rather than medicine or epidemiology. Often, statistics and game theory involve having to make decisions before you have all the information, which reflects reality quite often. We often must make decisions without all the data, evidence, and information, and we don’t have the luxury of waiting for that to be gathered. We must consider possible results (i.e., the virus spreads without symptoms or the virus spreads only with symptoms), the risks of different behaviors (e.g., wearing a mask or not wearing a mask), and possible outcomes. Here, it was clear in January that if the virus did spread without symptoms, and we failed to treat it as such, by the time we had the “evidence” we’d have a catasrophe and it would be too late to contain this. Waiting for the evidence was a very, very risky and dangerous game to play."

2020-06-28 13:41,"I found this article interesting about how science is actually done compared to the popular view of science as truth. Different things are called 'science,' and quite a number of theories about science have been advanced by philosophers, and by the way, also of truth.
Fauci had been told in January by Chinese experts of asymptomatic spread, and on Jan. 30, citing the New England Journal of Medicine, he said, “This study lays the question to rest.” Government has a very long history of lies, deception and untruths, including about health such as claiming the air around the World Trade Center was safe. Hence, the news organizations that propagated or amplified claims against masking also used up more of their ""credibility.""
Each person is responsible for choosing their health experts for advice in making better choices to protect themselves, their families and their communities. Political scientists claim that the interests of government officials differ from those of the people. Perhaps, if more persons took that responsibility more seriously, they may have reduced the risks of infection and death."
2020-06-28 14:17,"In other words, medical science had realized by February that Covid-19 was being transmitted by asymptomatic carriers, and were warning government officials and the media of it. I don't blame medical science for taking a couple of months to realize that, it was not apparent at the time. However, I absolutely blame government leaders, especially Trump, Bolsonaro, Putin and Johnson, for trying to deny their way out of the pandemic and refusing to do anything about it."

Once I heard the early, knowledgeable speculation, I accepted the likelihood of asymptomatic transmission and somewhat understood what this could mean for difficult-to-control spreading. Out came my mask and gloves and social distancing practices. I continue to assume that all of my contacts are carriers and act accordingly (I'm old but healthy). What I did not see was the politicization of containment of the disease. I periodically check the Johns Hopkins' dashboard to prove to myself how crazy Americans have become. Politicians claim they have succeeded while the data prove them wrong. US-style capitalism has become so virulent that people are literally killing themselves to make a buck. Sad."
2020-06-28 10:52,"Excellent reporting, which reminded me of something I read in the Washington Post in late April. 

NYT readers may or may not be aware of an ongoing Washngton Post lawsuit filed in U.S. District Court in Washington a few months ago, which centers on two cables -- both sensitive but unclassified -- sent to the State Department in 2018 from diplomats at the U.S. Embassy in Beijing after U.S. scientists made several visits to the Wuhan Institute of Virology, which has conducted studies on bat coronaviruses like the one that has caused the current health crisis.  

One of the cables, which the Post obtained, warned of inadequate safety precautions at the lab and cautioned that the lab’s study of bat coronaviruses and the potential for human transmission risked a SARS-like pandemic.

The second cable, curiously, has not been released.   If I know the State Department, the reason is almost certainly because it contains information that, if made public, will lend credence to the notion that the virus -- while originally found in nature -- likely emerged from a lab as a result of an accident of some sort, and thereby cause a global political and diplomatic onslaught against China.  I suspect that US officials do not want to jeopardize further worldwide economic instability at this time.

How do you know that asymtomatic transmission of Covid is “very rare”?  Based on what studies?  We do know that most young, healthy people do not show symptoms.  We also don’t have even a sketchy scientific guess as to how many of the young have had it and infected others."
2020-06-28 8:27,"CDC is the most to blame for this disaster. They should have woken up to the dangers of this virus much early on. From experience of other out brakes they should have realized that the only way to control the virus is to put a complete lock down on Wuhan not allowing any foreigner and local to leave the area and banning all entry. 

Foreign countries should have also kept their citizens in Wuhan at least till we had a clear grip on what was involved. Instead we sent planes to carry the virus home. 

I traveled from Qatar on the 25th to NYC. At Kennedy airport immigration was as usual. There was no testing and hardly any masks were being worn. People were standing shoulder to shoulder for hours. Some were coughing. 

CDC even blundered in waiting forever to declare it a pandemic. 

Now it has spread too far and wide. A complete lock down is no longer an option as locking down will mean shutting down the whole economy. The economy has to be opened up with proper precautions."

2020-06-28 6:35,"A doctor treating some of the infected Webasto families on the isolation ward was cited on bavarian radio in february that most of them are ""pumperlsgsund"" (= fit as a fiddle). It was obvious that asymptomatic parents infected their children. You could get this kind of information without reading scientific papers. Whereas the recommendations of the Robert Koch Institut regarding testing were always too late: even one month after we had ""fit as a fiddle"" corona patients who got infected from non-traveling asymtomatics you were only supposed to test people if they were seriously sick and came from Wuhan, Iran or Bergamo. 

I understand the lack of testing resources in february / march, but I am still dissapointed in the RKI. You must not change the scientific theory (or its message) just because the resources are not yet available."
2020-06-28 9:49,"What is totally missed during this COVID-19's spread and surge is that everyday scientists are making contributions that give hope. Hope springs eternal for those who are alive and that is 99.97% of American residents who will never die of COVID-19, and we have come a long long way from the panic and uncertainty of what happens if we get infected to a near certainty that we WILL NOT DIE if we get optimal medical attention if we are infected. Yes I am petrified if I have to ever be quarantined or even stay one more night in a hospital after spending 2 miserable nights following 2 separate procedures years ago. I was given a private room but I was in pain because I refused to take pain killers but my room was adjacent to the nurses station and right through the night there was a constant chattering of the loud voices.

Having survived through this pandemic so far and being found negative for the virus recently, I must be doing something right on my own terms. I have generously shared my reasons as to what it is that I do to try to stay healthy with anyone who cared to listen and follow my humble educated advice. So far my herd is doing just fine even though none of them have acquired herd immunity. I look forward to a safe deployable vaccine becoming available so that I don't feel like saying to anyone who tries to get close to me, get the heck out of my face. I felt very sorry last week when a little toddler who I had never met before was running towards me to give me a hug."
2020-06-28 14:20,"I have always thought the emphasis on testing was misguided when we knew from the beginning that Covid could be transferred from people who were infected but showed no symptoms.  Obviously then, it was spreading uncontrolled.
The advice should have been for hospitals to gear up and prepare for an onslaught but for the public to respond like it was the flu, get tested only if you’re sick.  Let the public know that some people would get very sick, some would die, and some would fight it off. 
Until a vaccine is developed and distributed or we develop herd immunity, all of this testing, all of these shutdowns, the job losses, the children at home and not in school....horrible, destructive decisions."

     I've even had a friend ask if I was ill simply because I was the only one in a socially-distanced setting still wearing my mask. 
     We all have surely been exposed to some virions by now. But what killed doctors and nurses early on was exposure after exposure that resulted in death.

In Russia there are few deaths from c19 - people die from pneumonia :(
In Sweden a laissez faire society grossly endangered their elderly because its citizens are so responsible.
In Belgium every suspect death was counted into the statistic from day one.
Here in the neo-liberal NL money is the holy cow par excellence. No masks except in public transport. Little testing. Schools to be opened. Tourists in en masse.

The most stable US genius has no other choice anymore than the austrich/denial tactic.  It's either win slightly - or loose big.

As he won't be held accountable (and neither the Democrats) I dare say that the US will have significantly more trouble to emerge with a black eye from this crisis than most other 'developed' countries.

I looked at mask effectiveness against disease on the internet. No clear information.
About a month ago, I finally saw the study that Asian countries were familiarized: everyone wearing masks reduces spread more than 90%. All images out of Asia show all wearing masks.
We are compelled to wear shirts and shoes to enter stores, seatbelts in our cars, helmuts when we ride bikes. But wearing masks is too much for half our country to bear. ""You can not take our freedom!"" they shout.

The pestilence of Trumpism is as bad as the plague itself and is an ally of this disease as it spreads -- he is the U.S. equivalent of Bolsonaro in Brazil and a shameful embarrassment to our country."

“Unwavering confidence“can be considered to be, and operate, as another type of virus.

2020-06-28 11:26,"Well- such incisive journalism by the NYT! This is medical espionage at its best. Back to the core of the report> As a physician scientist, I know how intense the pangs of publication can be, as in the academia ""publish or perish"" mantra rules over our heads, particularly when promotion, fame, salaries, the lure of being respected internationally are all at stake. I want to congratulate Dr. Rothe, for publishing the report in the New England Journal of Medicine. I am disappointed by the Swedish and other state authorities that refuted the claim the SARS-COV 2 virus can spread from completely asymptomatic (human)carriers. The Chinese woman probably would not have flown to Germany had she had any flu-like symptoms. Given the incubation period of approximately seven days, it makes sense that she had the virus before flying, and she was carrying in her system fighting the predator, which is why she remained asymptomatic until she was airborne halfway back to China. By this time, the virus succeeded in entering the cells of her body tissues. Therefore, challenging the  NEJM story was unfounded. Now that millions are getting infected and many without having any known exposure to mass gatherings, the NEJM story gains much ground. As the virus can be aerosolized even while talking, transmission can happen without anybody knowing. If, since January, people were advised to wear masks and maintain social distancing, we could be in a better situation today than in the mess we are in now."
2020-06-28 15:06,"1. The fact of the matter is, there were reasons to hold varying scientific opinions on asymptomatic transmission. There aren’t now, however.

2. The fact is, the science moved pretty fast. Especially in comparison to, say, Donald Trump—who was warned by Jan. 20 and then again before he restricted China travel without bothering to set up any screening or tracing, and then spent most of the next two months lying, screaming and playing golf. 

3. The denier method seems to be to yawp about masks, yell about lockdowns, make the simple insanely complex and the complex insanely simple, and so on. Pretty much the same armamentarium of lies and insanities you’ve seen regarding global warming."

Recently, news has begun to surface from scientists that it can do damage to neural pathways and may induce dementia like symptoms. ...and while a person may recover from those symptoms, they are speculating that there might be long term damage to the brain that, in effect, with age, could cause earlier onset of dementia and more severe symptoms because the brain has been, previously, so stressed by the virus.

It's also interesting to note that researchers have discovered that there is a correlation between blood type and the severity of symptoms.  In the first months of the pandemic, China made the same discovery though no one understands why.  They ""just"" know that it is a fact that the most severe symptoms, including the cytokine storm, happen most often in people of A+ blood type.

We are definitely in new territory here and we should take precautions without being told to do so by a ""hollow"" man who pretends to lead our government.

Mosquitos and malaria, mosquitos and encephalitis."

How did we fail making our voices heard (...and this is a rhetorical question, as I’m sure other scientists and reporters can describe, aptly, why these warnings were not heard...)?

I find it nothing less than chilling to read how critical data was (and is) routinely dismissed by the very organizations that are supposed to be protectors of and advocators for public health. It is equally startling to read about the initial reluctance to sound the alarm to governments.  I fear we are just beginning to see the repercussions of failing to act in time, and of reopening some states in the U.S. too early  In the early days of shutdown this crisis seemed to be a harbinger of what awaits the world for failing to act in time (despite mountains of scientific evidence) on the existential issue of climate disruption.  I am by nature an optimist, yet even so I sometimes find myself having little hope for humanity."
2020-06-28 16:38,"The pandemic was missed early on because of a perfect storm. A lack of scientific information; decades of casting scientific information into doubt as if there is something better out there to inform us; the dissembler in chief whose every word has to be fact checked;and  a business community that spread a misinformation campaign so its cash flow wasn't interrupted (aided and abetted by the president). The cost has been great.

Assumptions play a role. The germaphobes held sway. Hand washing was a radical practice that reduced mortality in maternity wards in the 1860s.  Smallpox and ebola can be spread by contact. However, the worst aspects of Covid 19 appear to be respiratory. The plan: don't touch any surface touched by humans and don't touch your face afterwards. The first interventions were to scrub every surface. It probably made little difference. 

We rightly assume that the spread of Covid is from one person to the next. But is another factor at work as well? The virus came to the East Coast from Italy. Do we know how many repatriated individuals were infected? Cases appeared on a cruise ship where everyone was isolated to their room. Then an epidemic in a nursing homes appeared. We barely looked twice. The virus can live on metal and plastic parts for days. It is found on the air vents in ill patient rooms. What happens to that air. It is often recycled. Did airplanes dump infected air as they landed? Have our recycled air systems multiplied the contagion?"
2020-06-28 17:36,"It's very frustrating. Covid-19 should have been when the world realised that scientists are trustworthy. They may sometimes be wrong, but they say what they think, based on the evidence - and not what they think they should say. If they give policy advice, this should always be strictly separated from communicating the facts and the data. 

The whole story about masks was a disaster from day one. What it showed the public was that scientists, like politicians, will lie when it suits their purpose. 

This asymptomatic transmission was another example. The article neatly describes why they acted as they did, but it doesn't make it OK.

Really, how embarrassing."
2020-06-28 18:38,"Aside from the frustrating inability of these scientists and public health officials to find ways to support or clarify one another’s findings - due to the set of systemic failures pointed out by another commenter - there may be additional valuable information we could learn from Dr. Rothe’s team and others: when they have found the infection early in patients, what treatments have they been using, because it sounds as if her team was able to prevent deaths and possibly the additional physical damage that is being reported. A follow-up piece on what separate medical teams with high successful treatment rates have been doing, no corroboration required - might be instructive."

I'm all for having it, I support it, I want it, we need it, all countries should fund it, but we need to be able to trust that the best of the best are overseeing it and coordinating the information coming in from around the globe. How difficult would it have been to have the WHO as a central repository for these vital submissions of albeit limited studies, instead of the rush to publish at various medical journals? None of us was helped by the scattershot approach and race for credit. Covid has exposed a lot of failures, and the lack of centralized, public approaches in all areas, in all countries, with all governments will be shown to have been one of them."
2020-06-27 18:19,"It wouldn't have mattered in the United States if a warning about non-symptomatic transmission had been issued from the outset. Trump would've followed the same script, downplaying the threat to avoid spooking the stock market.

I think this one passage should be highlighted, too:

""The Chinese health authorities had explicitly cautioned that patients were contagious before showing symptoms. A Japanese bus driver was infected while transporting seemingly healthy tourists from Wuhan.""

So much for Trump's and his campaign's efforts to blame-shift by making the Chinese this year's Muslim bogeymen and putting it all on them that our nation's response has been the worst.

Our uniquely massive disaster is entirely on him."

We seem to be an incredibly selfish and ignorant people bent on cutting off our collective noses to spite our faces. 

I marvel at how 80 years ago we could successfully coordinate a response to an attack on our land. We beat disease after disease into submission; we leapt into space. Now? We can't even collectively bother to wear simple cloth masks."
2020-06-28 15:49,"The idea that you guys could write, edit, and publish an article discussing Covid-19’s Silent Spread and not discuss the Chinese Central Government pushing the idea that asymptomatic carriers were not a threat (which they continue to still do), and that the WHO ignored warnings from Taiwan because they trusted the PRoC more is absolutely insane. The WHO was largely basing much of its early information from the PRoC, and not even faulting the latter for the intense amount of misinformation/misleading number counts/etc that arrived out of early reports from China is insane."
2020-06-28 18:27,"In February I daily emailed/posted inquired ""how is the virus propagated"" receiving only guesses that it travels via entrained globules of mucous when someone coughs or sneezes -- and that those droplets only travel 6'.

Hence, the source of the 6' rule.

Only in late March did a few small studies show these very small viruses being projected by normal speech or laughter--and thus flying airborne in dense clouds 30' or more and remaining in an enclosed area for maybe 24 hours.

But the real malpractice by the scientific community was the absurd diktat not to wear ANY masks, warning that we would thereby deprive medical providers of safe masks.

Had the scientists bothered to look at a globe, they would have discovered that mask-wearing countries have the virus under control.

So, long after that became obvious, the politicians did a 180 and told us to wear are a hodgepodge of masks --whose real benefit is that even a simple one layer cloth bandanna can reduce our own discharges.

Realistically, if the populace would wear masks (and gloves) folks would stop touching their faces with infected fingers and we might have a shot at getting R less than 1.

Otherwise, the pandemic will continue to spread and kill."

2020-06-28 15:08,"The Chinese are at the center of how the world missed Covid 19's silent spread.  

Surveillance satellites picked up a dramatic increase in traffic into Wuhan hospitals all the way back in August of 2019.  

The Rand Corporation just completed a study that concluded that the Chinese understated their Covid 19 caseload by 40 times ... that's right 40X.  That means instead of 85,000 cases back in March, they had 3,400,000 cases.

Finally, during this time the Chinese did nothing to slow or curtail Chinese citizens from leaving China traveling abroad.  Given the Rand study, it is logical to conclude that the Chinese knew they had an epidemic on their hands and many of these Chinese travelers were infected.  The best measure the Chinese could take to prevent their hidden epidemic from becoming a world-wide pandemic would require them to lockdown their country.  They consciously and cold bloodedly chose not to curtail travel out of their country.  As a result, these Chinese travelers became the Typhoid Marys of the Covid 19 world-wide pandemic.

So, China is not only the source of Covid 19, but due to their cold calculated decisions, China is the singular reason for this world wide pandemic."
2020-06-28 16:49,"Data from the first report about the characteristics of coronavirus cases from Wuhan (Wu Z, McGoogan JM. JAMA. 2020 Feb 24. doi:0.1001/jama.2020.2648. PMID: 32091533) provided strong epidemiologic evidence for asymptomatic transmission based on the fact that only 2% of cases were in children whereas about 20% of the Chinese population are children.  For an entirely new virus, children and adults should be assumed equally susceptible.  Dr. Victor Cardenas pointed out the implications of the lack of cases in children and raised the possibility of substantial asymptomatic transmission in a comment about the Wu and McGoogan report that was published in JAMA on March 1, 2020.  (<a href=""https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2762130"" target=""_blank"">https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2762130</a>) Comment 10.

In light of just the evidence on age from Wuhan, the persistent strong statements by WHO that there was no asymptomatic transmission bewildered me--a retired epidemiologist.    

Thanks to Matt Apuzzo, Selam Gebrekidan, and David Kirkpatrick for explicating the behind-the-scenes cat-fight that took the world down the garden path that led to more SARS-CoV-2 transmission than there might have been."
2020-06-28 15:19,"When Trump took office, the CDC had a staff of 47 in China.  Under the President, it was reduced to only 14.  No wonder we had little warning and information from what was happening early on in China.

2020-06-28 16:38,"In early March I submitted an LTE to the International Herald Tribune because I was so frustrated by the arrogance of the US medical establishment in continuing to deny asymptomatic transmission and the really stupid advice that resulted. I know nothing about medicine and who was I? So of course it wasn't published but it was so obvious. The media played into the denial too, something that @MattApuzzo doesn't really include:
3/9/20
Since early January I have been reading that US scientists doubted Chinese assertions that the coronavirus could spread from asymptomatic people. Why take this stubborn position on an issue with such huge implications? Medical arrogance?

Well the Chinese were right. They have documented asymptomatic transmission and shared their results with the scientific community. Now the telltale signs of it are everywhere. Half the people who recently tested positive on one of the floating Princess disease incubators were totally asymptomatic.

This calls into question advice about coughing into your elbow and staying home ""when you are sick"" to contain the disease. In fact, people should have been staying home even when they were not sick, but without millions of test kits, we never could have known if they carried the virus.

Why did our scientific community wait so long to admit these crucial facts and why did the news media not cover this critical aspect of the pandemic?"

I thought my problems were somehow related to a drug commonly perscribed for nerve pain, which I concluded, didn't like me. Yes, after a stay at a nursing home, I returned home and to this day I have sleeplessness, nap during the day and suffer periods of difficulty breathing relieved by sitting up.

If ALL will observe the wise prophylactic advisories, IGNORE Donald Trump's lies... wash hands and face, mask up when around others, use goggles to protect yourself, avoid closed rooms with anyone, do not touch your face, use distance to protect. Note: the virus enters via the eye, nose and mouth: cover these areas. Mask to protect others... and use N-95 to protect yourself. Bathe daily. Do not socialize.

It's like certain nations, including the US, have an infantile capacity to comprehend the world around them, a child-like inability to mentally grasp full reality. As overpopulation and climate change continue to challenge humanity, the US simply doesn't seem to have the discipline, much less the cognitive ability, to confront and overcome the hazards that lie ahead."
2020-06-29 15:18,"The famed psychiatrist Karl Menninger wrote up a study of 80 patients suffering mental illness after but directly related to the flu pandemic of 1918, titled ""Psychoses Associated with Influenza"". In it, categories are defined as ""delirium, dementia praecox (now: schizophrenia), ""other psychoses"" and a fourth category ""unclassified."" 
The largest group was the second, schizophrenia. Many patients showed delirium during illness but not discussed (febrile delirium) but also after the illness. He cites a delay post illness of 2-8 days. 
Clearly the numbers suggest that mental impact is not necessarily.
He also cites discussions of ""deliria consequence of epidemic"" dating back to 1385. 
We also know of other neurological impact such as the worldwide epidemic of encephalitis lethargica. 
This is not over. 
The most concerning aspect of this disease is that as a viral airborne disease transmissible among humans, it will have to burn through the population until such time as we all collectively achieve ""herd"" immunity, which means either we all get it and develop antibodies, or we are vaccinated. Most of what you hear in the media about a vaccine ""by the end of the year"" is unreasonably optimistic. There were initial abortive attempts to develop a SARS vaccine after 2003 but our commercial model and lack of pursuit by CDC/NIH/Fauci's NIAID."

Before he was diagnosed with COVID, he called 911 from the rehab facility and told police he was being tortured by the nurses. He has told me many of the “dreams” he had when he was under, and many of them are similar to what these patients have reported. Someone tried to kill him, he saw God and asked him for another chance, and that details in our lives were changed. He has now been off the ventilator for six weeks and is still often confused. He asks me at least once a week how many boyfriends I have (I have had the same one for five years: he knew him pre-COVID). It is frightening. Sometimes he is totally lucid and sometimes says fantastical things. He has a head wound but no idea how he got it. This is horrifying part of the disease people don’t often hear about. This is why we wear masks. Whatever it takes to prevent us from having to live in this hell, however temporary it may be."

2020-06-30 1:12,"Three years ago, my spouse spent time in an ICU as she was suffering from hypercalcemia. This had been precipitated by advanced B-cell lymphoma but the diagnosis was only confirmed as a result of testing while she was in hospital. She experienced hallucinations and nightmares of women dressed all in black surrounding her bed and wanting to kill her. Her oncologist explained that these dreams were most likely caused by the meds she was taking and her weakened immune system and other factors. Later, when she was on a chemo-therapy course (R-CHOP) that included one very potent drug (Vincristin), she again had weird dreams. The point is that there are many different medical conditions that can impact the neurological system and the brain. She was fortunate to recover completely from the lymphoma, but it took a year of treatment and rehab. Her hearing was permanently affected as was her balance. Speech not so much. 

It is during such medical treatments (now for Covid-19) that we are at our most vulnerable because our bodies respond in unusual ways that we cannot explain. It’s frightening and real to those experiencing the viral infection or cancer, as the case may be. And there can be lasting damage that many different kinds of viruses can exact on us."

Your mind does not travel beyond your own ""worldview"" unless it is dragged there, even in dreams. 

For example, a peaceful and kind person who never watches scary movies or thinks an evil thought would not simply ""dream up"" seeing someone who is alive and having nails driven into their head. Nor would they have a wristwatch become a catheter. Normal innocent people do not have suppressed evil in them. These are external ideas foisted on your mind. I am certain this is fact, because I know the source of the evil behind it. 

Whether you believe it or not, you could maybe help your loved one by acknowledging that they are being victimized while going through this. To call evil and disgusting ""ideas"" that are beyond the imagination of a kind and caring person only a figment of their own imagination is to treat the victim dismissively. They are real ""visions"" and not something your mind wandered into on its own without any prior experiential basis as a frame of reference or jumping off point for your mind. You are okay.

Instead of saying it was too late to contact trace because so many people had the virus, it should have been obvious that a greater number of cases should make it easier to find routes of transmission. There could be several candidates for each when the disease is more widespread, but that is doubtful because of the lockdown. It was a surprise to Gov Cuomo that when the question was asked, it turned out new cases came from people staying at home.
There was, is, and continues to be, a ridiculous privacy objection to a mandated and centralized contact tracing app.
For regular contact tracing, how did it take March, April, May, and then only in June, for it to begin in the New York?
How exactly does Japan have 8/million death rate, or Germany 108/million, but the US at 350/million and France, Italy, Spain and the UK all over 450? Japan, no app, no severe shutdown, very little testing.

I’m about Boris’s age. I grew up in the UK, but moved here to the USA in early adulthood. The phrase “Whac-A-Mole” was not one I had ever heard until I came to this country. From Boris’s use of it to describe his strategy for dealing with the virus, I gather it’s a phrase Brits now are somewhat familiar with. But I’m not convinced he understands it properly. (We can add it the list of the many other things he doesn’t understand properly.)

2020-06-25 1:16,"We have learned plenty, if we cared to learn on how to live with Coronavirus CoV-2. China taught US the most after the SARS Coronavirus 1 in 2003. China started temperature checks at airports and entry points right after and during SARS CoV-1. It learned how to build quarantine facilities and hospital beds with abundant supply of ventilators and oxygen supply. Chinese people woke proper masks properly proudly and frequently in public. China's liberation army was deployed to enforce lock downs with locks, before COVID-19 pandemic it did introduce testing rapidly. But it committed a colossal blunder in silencing the voices of Doctor Li WenLiang and public health officials and that delay resulted in the rapid export and spread to the rest of the world without anyone knowing until it was too late. The colossal damage was done. Germany's Angela adopted a scare tactic that kept the Germans to stay Germans. She made an outrages claim that 2/3rd of Germany will be infected. It worked. Germans did what they always do with discipline and in an orderly manner. Follow all safety precautions outlined by the German Health officials and the German health care infrastructure stepped up to the challenges and the travel restrictions from neighboring Italy and China were of the utmost value. Then there is the isolated sparsely populated continent country of Australia in the South Pacific that can boast of having conquered COVID-19 by restricting travel from China a day after the USA did."
2020-06-25 1:25,"After working and travelling in many countries, and discovering there's so many different ways of doing things, I've often wondered why countries don't share their best practices with one another? Pre-Covid, I suppose you could say it's because different cultures have different needs. This time we all need the same thing: keep this virus from decimating the population. So I'm thinking this is the best time ever to share best practices -- and I think the places that learn and share with others will definitely fare better on this wild ride."

We had one chance to knock this thing down and we blew it from lack of national leadership and a collective, coordinated response. It was first a media hoax then it was all supposed to go away like magic, then it was all China's fault.  So here we are.

Our love of Darwinian capitalism will take us down the path of Darwinian biology.  We will have our plague in the name of freedom or whatever.

Everyone is going to have to protect themselves through masking.  We really need N95 masks, like about a billion of them.  That is the best protection.  Where are they?  Those who do not wear masks in indoor spaces are putting themselves at risk.  It still looks like the virus is killing about 5% of confirmed cases and  we think we are only confirming about 5% to 10% of infections.  That puts the kill rate from 0.5% to 1%.  

To some, this is an acceptable rate of death.  But then, if you are part of that 1%, not such a good outcome.  If ever we needed a leader, we need one now."

We have a rebellious segment of our population which views any rules as an infringement on its ""rights"" and a POTUS who eggs on their worst instincts. While a number of our governors have done well, our state borders are obviously porous, which makes preventing and containing new outbreaks in current lower infection areas much more difficult.

Apart from that, it feels like corona has become history..
Two weeks ago they introduced a corona warning app, open source, so no one could extract data he's not supposed to get.

2020-06-24 13:58,"I’m thoroughly upset by the info in this article.  According to news outlets around the world just a couple months ago inventors around the world were developing ventilators composed of commercially sourced components.  Where are those ventilators now when they could be put to such good use?
This article references O2 concentrators as well and their relative simplicity.  I know from personal experience as a controls engineer the equipment necessary to concentrate O2 from ambient atmosphere is easy to manufacture and scale up to almost any size.  The compressors necessary to fill the cylinders used in hospitals are a little more complex.  But in the end, all of this technology is readily available, inexpensive, and should already be in place around the world.  
The question which needs to be asked of the UN, WHO, and all the other alphabet soup agencies which should have gotten this equipment in place in every country in the world is what have you been doing to solve this problem?
The entire world has known for months the effective treatments for Covid.  Why aren’t we demanding the NGO’s responsible for this shed their bloated bureaucracies and perform as this virus requires.  A fast nimble response is necessary.  If you’re an NGO responsible for getting medical care into undeveloped countries you should be moving with lightning speed to preserve human life or have the bright light of journalism telling the world why you’re not."

It was great, it is the size of a large refrigerator. And can be powered by a diesel generator if the power goes out. It pulls oxygen from the air and can fill multiple oxygen tanks simultaneously. However, it does require cleaning and downtime to do maintenance.  

The hospital I was at actually bought tanks of air from 3rd party vendors and only used this machine when a delivery didn't arrive. I asked why they didn't use this machine all the time, and was told it is easier to buy oxygen, than keep a trained person to manage the machine."
2020-06-24 17:11,A friend who is an experienced nurse told me recently that the means to make O2 concentrators are not that difficult or expensive. When someone needs oxygen  there is not much time. Perhaps the mechanics are not universally shared and understood. Now would be the time.

And I always wondered how do they haul back.

They haul back the way they were hauled in - rolling them on ends while upright.

I saw ONE women wearing a mask. one  fairly young women walking alone wearing a mask. No one else even had one around their neck.
We have to wear seat belts , follow traffic rules and not smoke almost everywhere but people yell that a mask is violating their civil right. That is just insanity..

Lessons were taken. I hope others too."
2020-06-30 15:28,"Things that will likely help

1. Wear a mask when you are anywhere indoors not in your own home.

2. Wear a mask outdoors if you can't socially distance. On a walk on a suburban or rural street with almost no one around. You can forgo a mask otherwise wear it.

3. Meet with other people outside your household only in very small groups (one or two other family members or friends) then wait two weeks before you meet with another group. Yes, this is some  risk vs never doing so but imagine if this family had known at the time to do this. At most 2 other people would have been put at risk and the virus would not have spread to so many. At some point, if there is no vaccine we need to see our family members and friends and this is a way to have at least some interaction while reducing spread.  Wearing masks when not eating.

5. No bars or nightclubs for the foreseeable future. Restaurants with family members or a very small number of others spacing out as above. Eat outside when possible. Restaurants should be encouraged to install the best air filtration possible and improve soundproofing and NO LOUD MUSIC (the last thing  you want is people shouting to be heard!)
 
6. Work on your BMI. The risk is clearly lower with a 'normal' BMI. Look at the story of the 'healthy' young people hospitalized with COVID in the NYT Not a one has a BMI in the normal (healthy) range."
2020-06-30 15:35,"Usually, to save a life, you must possess great skill or great courage.  Wearing a mask is a small and easy gesture, not just a kindness or a courtesy, although it is both.  By wearing a mask, each of us has the chance to save the life of someone.  What a rare gift.  Please, wear your mask and wash your hands.  Save a life.

I commend the Fuscos for their commitment to science and to participating in clinical trials that will advance the world’s understanding of this virus.   I admire their advocacy and love for one another."

““These idiots are out there and not taking precautions,” he said. “Not wearing a mask. And not doing what they’re supposed to do. They’re out of their minds.””

2020-06-30 17:19,"@M. Staley 

The BMI may be a number on a scale, but that number can represent excess fat -- which is the true problem. Virtually everyone whose obesity places them at risk of horrible consequences -- if they are infected with this coronavirus -- can lift sections of their body fat.

Many years ago, Special K ran ads with the question, ""Can you pinch more than an inch [of body fat]?"". If so, the implication was, you're eating too much of the wrong things -- so turn to Special K.

Instead, turn to veggies and fruit, lots of them. Fish and some dairy (like yogurt). If you eat meat, make it lean (like turkey). Drink plenty of water. No alcohol. No fried anything. No snacking, unless it's a fresh fruit/veggie. And cut your portions way, way down."

I truly appreciate members of the family to take the time to share their experiences and that they are working with Johns Hopkins in three scientific studies in hopes of finding clues and possible remedies for this killer virus.

2020-07-01 11:41,"My fellow Americans:  it does not matter what race you are, or where your political or religious beliefs fall, we can all see that President Trump, Vice-President Pence, Mitch McConnell, and the Republican Party have failed to do the simple things needed to control this virus.  To paraphrase Ronald Reagan, ask yourself, ""Are you better off since this administration learned of the virus?""  Now ask yourself ""If this had been a nuclear attack or any other major crisis, do you see leadership that can handle it, that can be honest with the citizenry and take steps to save the people they serve?""

Simple measures:  wear a mask, social distance, invest in testing, and provide medical personnel the resources they need.  In a nation with billionaires of the scale of Jeff Bezos, Bill Gates, Warren Buffet, and Peter Thiel---this should have happened.  But there is no collaboration between Trump and anyone of impact.  No sign that this will come.  A preference for suppression of numbers and science; firing or threats to fire competent people who want to tell the truth. 

So do the right thing in November:  be a registered voter, be able to vote by mail, and change the leadership. 

Our lives depend upon this."

It is established science that people whose ancestors survived bubonic plague are resistant to HIV becoming AIDS. Many cardiac problems, diabetes, etc. can be familial. In my family some who smoked heavily lived well into their 80’s and one light smoker lived to be 100; but in my wife’s family everyone who smoked or even was exposed to secondhand smoke died of cancer, mostly lung cancer. We would all do well to depoliticize the discussion, recognize that all of society cannot be shut down, and support research science, not questionable statistical inference, to develop treatments and then a vaccine. This is like measles and mumps before the vaccines, not like smallpox or plague. Most people with the childhood illnesses got sick and almost all survived. For unknown reasons a few did not or were left with deficits. We did not shut down society. Politics, whether right OR left wing, will not provide the answers. Scientific research will."

And I just learned that my cousin who is pushing 80 and has every other risk factor imaginable, including diabetes, obesity and high blood pressure, caught Covid-19 while in a nursing home a few weeks ago and is still testing positive. And yet she has so far shown no symptoms whatsoever. This just demonstrates that there is no rhyme or reason to this disease.

But we know how simple measures can stop the disease from spreading. If every political leader, instead of discouraging mask-wearing, had encouraged it and set an example by wearing a mask in public, how many lives could have been saved?"
2020-07-01 16:04,"A story that is at once hard to read, and fascinating: the range of reactions to this puzzling disease, within one family.  Thanks to all of this family for what they are doing, and my sympathy for what they have endured."
2020-07-01 19:14,"What a beautiful, loving family.  May you recover from the disease quickly, and may your memories and closeness comfort you in as you grieve.  
The matriarch, Grace, thought about others as she was dying, when she asked her daughter to deliver the food to the homeless.  Her children took her example of community-mindedness by volunteering for scientific studies that can lead to knowledge and treatments for Covid-19.  Wow, Fusco family, you are an inspiration - God bless you!"
2020-07-01 12:10,"New Jersey grieves for the Fusco family.  
They got sick so early in the pandemic - it wasn’t anyone’s fault.  

Today we know better.  Here we wear a mask everywhere we go and we have been doing so since April 1.  I don’t know why this is political- 

Wear a mask, social distance, wash your hands and most of all- be kind."
2020-07-01 16:41,"“After weeks on ventilators, two siblings remain too weak to work even as their medical bills mount.”

In virtually every other democratic nation in the world, people do not have to worry about this or live like this. It is a choice we have made as a society to have a healthcare system based on profit. This family should have zero medical bills. Getting sick should not hurt you financially whatsoever. Until we change that, this country will be a failure."
2020-07-01 9:46,Can not imagine their loss. I'm glad to see this update on them. They were one of the first families I read about at the beginning of this nightmare. Thanks to them for looking outside themselves and helping others after such a horrific loss!
2020-07-01 13:00,"We all want answers to why some people have serious cases & some very mild but the experts aren’t able to provide them. Perhaps this family will find some solace in their contribution to 
research.
It appears that right now the only defense is the big three...wash hands, wear a mask & social distance.
In speaking to front line workers the only “underlying condition” that seems nearly universal (other than extreme old age) is BMI over 30. Obesity makes care very difficult. Perhaps when this crisis is past, We’ll get serious about consciously managing diet & exercise."
2020-07-01 10:34,Sorry to say that on my side of the Ocean people who don't care exist also.  Too many people refuse to admit it is not a simple flu. Too many deads just because so many people have a little pea in stead of a brain as we say overhere.  Take care of you dear American friends. If every body would keep a distance of 5 feet with any other human beeing it would help so much.  My US 88 years old pen friend since 1946 gives no more sign of life. It is terrible for me.
2020-07-01 9:27,"Too bad stories like this one aren't required reading for all those fools who are so very cavalier about this disease - especially the parts which mention that some of the sickest were family members without underlying health conditions. This virus is capricious or at least seems so. Some very old are recovering while some young folks who go into it seemingly healthy are becoming deathly ill and even dying. Only a fool shrugs it off and assumes that they will have a ""mild"" case (apparently thinking that ""mild"" is like a minor cold when folks who have mild cases of Covid-19 are often very sick at home). 

Note: Catholics do not wear scapulas (generally something like a shoe-lace with a small, rectangular piece of cloth/felt front and back with a picture of a saint on it) just when they pray or specifically for prayer. They are warn all the time."

2020-07-02 5:30,"My heart goes out to this family. I lost my mother less than two years ago & that was hard, but to lose a parent & three siblings within a span of a week? Grandparent, aunt & uncles? My deepest condolences."
2020-07-02 10:24,"“We know another wave is going to come,” Ms. Fusco said. “It’s inevitable. Whatever will help this world is all I care about.”

This brings tears to my eyes.  

Can you imagine if the most powerful person in the world embraced this sentiment and acted on it instead of trafficking in grievances and corruption.  

Godspeed, Ms. Fusco."
2020-07-02 14:25,"The fact that each of the deceased was NOT immediately autopsied is a slap in the face of the Fusco family & Medical Science. 

For the readers, the next of KIN usually, if not always, requests & pays for the autopsy.  This is a pandemic. Every CLUE is vital for treatment (relatives?) for other victims. In particular, for the sake of a medical science/history.  

Kudos to the sibling fighting with all her might. But, that entire family absolutely should have demanded & paid for the autopsies.  

Knowledge is POWER."

However, I am also a parent,  and the mental health toll is high with kids staying at home. Then there is the food issue, the increase in child abuse, etc. I really, really hope there is a solution here that involves in school learning."
2020-07-01 17:18,"I'm a 51-year-old school psychologist who's raring to get back into my buildings with the students this fall. Dr. O'Leary's summation of AAP's recommendations has both objective and intuitive appeal. Please, school administrators, make it so. Earnest attempts at making distance learning meaningful were admirable, but in the end it was just a bandaid over a gaping wound. Educators like me will necessarily be masked and keep our distance from one another (and holding our many necessary meetings will continue to be a challenge), but having the kids back in their school community will be job #1."
2020-07-01 17:07,"I am all for this, but will someone explain to regular mothers (not wealthy mommy drop off mothers) how will the students arrive at school? In major cities like LA and NYC students take public transportation. Please explain."
2020-07-01 17:28,"As a parent of a special needs student, I can say that distance learning flat out didn't happen. It isn't the most practical for a student who relies on individual direct instruction, but materials weren't even offered. I did my own scraping together of resources online just to maintain the skills he already has academically. I know I'm far from alone in talking to other parents of Autistic kids; children like ours stand to lose the most, academically and socially, and are often left out of the conversation entirely. Even so, I recognize mine has a leg up by having a parent at home, having space to play outside, and being safe in his home."
2020-07-01 17:31,"It would strike me as a rather fundamental question of the primary function that we, as a society, chose to fund by creating public schools.  Wasn't it for the benefit of creating opportunities for children through education?  There should certainly be furlough/unemployment options for teachers who feel that being around children is too much risk for now.  If you became an educator, you should consider what risks you are simply trading off on to others if choosing personal interests over the children."
2020-07-01 17:34,"Did I not hear Dr. Fauci say the same thing yesterday? Ultimately, parents will make the decision. Moreover, school administrators will make decisions about how to protect kids.

To be honest, I am not a parent. I do not know what I would do. I just appreciate the fact that there is a significant downside to keeping kids at home.

Moreover, I do not have a crystal ball. I have no clue what conditions will be like in the fall."
2020-07-01 17:35,"Sending children to school this fall is likely to spread the virus, all the commuting and transportation done by the kids and their parents.  Since kids don't often attend schools in their own neighbors as they should, logistics of their transportation are going to be a real problem."
2020-07-01 17:37,"So the Doctor basically wants Schools to open so that parents can go to work. Treating Schools as free day care. Doctor has two teenage children and says not much learning was happening during remote learning and talks about behavioral issues with keeping kids home? Nothing about testing or contact tracing. Obviously knows how crowded Schools are, knows if they try to social distance in Schools, half the kids will have to stay home, so his suggestion, no need to social distance, just throw thousands of students and faculty in closed, crowded space for hours a day. Let us experiment and see what happens. We get it, distance learning is inconvenience to many parents."
2020-07-01 17:39,"As a teacher whenever I hear someone who desperately desires normalcy and is advocating opening schools use the phrase ""we must strike a balance,"" I think -- okay, it's a balance between students' social lives and teachers' physical lives.  I think we need to stop trying to stuff the old ways of doing things into the new reality."
2020-07-01 17:22,"Anyone thinking of opening NYC public schools even part time in the fall should first read this excellent journalistic piece in the Nation.  Teachers are absolutely right to be frightened.  Teachers and staff were *not* protected before and have no reason to think they will be protected in the fall.  There is no budget for the kinds of changes that would need to take place to open schools safely.  In fact, the education budget has been severely slashed.  *Of course* it would be best for kids to be back in school.  But there is no way right now that NYC, in any case, has figured out a safe way to do this, and teachers and staff lives should not be sacrificed just to put kids in school.  There will be another surge in the fall/winter and schools would likely have to shut again anyway.  Theorizing is well and good, but actually there is *no* action plan that keeps anybody safe right now, and there is no budget for the kinds of changes that need to happen.  

Here is the article that exposes what went on when Di Blasio refused to close the schools despite the fact that teachers were getting sick and dying.  Public schools also hid the fact that staff were sick from COVID.  This is the story that no one except public school staff seems to know about.  It needs to be known!  <a href=""https://www.thenation.com/article/society/schools-teachers-covid"" target=""_blank"">https://www.thenation.com/article/society/schools-teachers-covid</a>/"
2020-07-01 17:34,"Phrases like “the vast majority of children recover from COVID“ is cold comfort. Who will explain to the parents of the one child that theirs was an entirely preventable death? Can you say district lawsuit? 

This article talks about keeping kids six feet apart in classrooms. Ok, what about buses? Public transportation? Hallways? Cafeterias? The bathrooms? What about unsupervised kids who...shocker...won’t follow the distancing rules? If one kid in one class gets sick, his entire schedule of classes needs to be cleared out: all his classmates and all his teachers need to quarantine. Then what? Those teachers teach at least 4 other classrooms of students. Are those kids to be quarantined as well? Are you going to get retired teachers willing to sub for those teachers in quarantine? I doubt it. 

I get that it’s a mess, and tough for everyone, and that online learning is not as good as face to face. But it’s better than dying."
2020-07-01 17:24,"Today’s front page headline in The Oregonian newspaper reads “Infections Rising Fastest Among Young Children” with the article stating, “Coronavirus cases among children younger than 10 grew fivefold during the month of June, representing the fastest growth rate of new or presumed infections across any age range.”

I understand the importance of keeping children in school for their academic and social/emotional growth, but this virus is deadly.  Now is the time for school districts to plan a robust and comprehensive online education program and educate families about how to support, monitor and extend learning at home until a vaccine is available for COVID-19.  We cannot risk the lives of children or the adults in schools."
2020-07-01 17:42,"This would have been at least feasible, had we, as a nation, taken the necessary steps to control the spread of the coronavirus early on. I fear it's far too late for late for that now, which means having schools open is a recipe for disaster. The children may be fine, but what about the adults?"
2020-07-01 17:45,"First: I guess I need more data to convince me that children are not vectors of this disease. Has the lack of symptoms in children led to a lack of testing? If we’re not testing, do we know for sure where community spread is coming from? Maybe schools aren’t sources of outbreaks in Europe, but a) are we talking about countries that reopened with infections *far* more under control than the US; and b) school systems/transit options that have better general infrastructure and funding for hygiene needs than those in the US? 

But there are a million other things to consider. For example: what happens when teachers are exposed and have to quarantine? Where are the subs coming from? Are subs as effective as regular classroom teachers? Where are all the funds for all the medical leave going to come from? 

The fact of the matter is that I agree with the APA’s recommendations—in a vacuum. But I feel that the doctors are not taking into consideration all of the relevant factors. Maybe it’s more efficient in the long run if we continue with distance learning until folks in this country decide to prioritize safety and get the daily case counts down. In any case, the blame for whatever outcome cannot be borne solely by teachers. The conditions under which we are making these tough choices are not of our own design. We have failed to invest in our public education system for too long, and now we are set to abdicate our collective responsibility to schools yet again with finger pointing."
2020-07-01 17:50,"It doesn't appear that the American Academy of Pediatrics are being very cautious about recommending that kids go back to the classroom in light of the COVID related immune problems many children have suffered and some have died.  It is a rare condition now, but what will happen when more kids get together?  Will it spread and harm more children?"
2020-07-01 17:54,"I can understand the pediatrician's point of view here; however he is mainly speaking as a parent - the health and safety issues for the virus as it pertains to children are still evolving. Having worked for years in over-crowded, crumbling buildings, I can't see how all children could be stuffed in classrooms in any safe sort of way.  Perhaps the hybrid  model could work - half the children two days per week, the other half for two days a week - could be feasible, but to send all the children back as if the virus wasn't here seems to be a recipe for disaster for all involved."
2020-07-01 17:39,"RE: masks. Your article - and I assume Dr Leary - references the Lancet study, which says ""Face mask use could result in a large reduction in risk of infection (n=2647; aOR 0·15, 95% CI 0·07 to 0·34, RD −14·3%, −15·9 to −10·7; low certainty), with 
 
stronger associations with N95 or similar respirators compared with disposable surgical masks or similar (eg, reusable 12–16-layer cotton masks;

2020-07-01 17:44,"As a physician and public health professional, I must take issue with two things.

The evidence that transmissions between children are rare are, at this point, based upon public health, community reporting and self-reporting data. There have been no peer-reviewed studies to confirm this serological and, given that children are less likely to exhibit symptoms, this is important. In fact, studies using the same kind of data using at the experiences of Europe and Asia suggest that the the outcome is mixed. This may be due to the nature of schools or child care facilities or other factors.

For the lack of serologic data I blame the Federal government that has failed to provide the resources to states and municipalities to do serological screenings and contact tracing.

The other that the study does not, adequately, address is the fact that while known prevalence of COVID in children is significant lower than that in adults, the question becomes more thorny when you break down the ages.

Of all children with known illness (not infection) 70% are age  10-17, which corresponds to Middle and High Schools. This is also the age range of children who are more likely to benefit from remote learning and less likely to suffer more severe psychosocial problems because they have stronger and more stable social relationships developed over longer periods of time.

This, and greater autonomy from parents, allows them to maintain social relationships online.

The devil may be in the details."
2020-07-01 17:51,"*IF* DOE sends kids and teachers back to school in the fall, I personally hope it is one week on, one week off to pack the most benefit into a concentrated period of time, and then give everyone a week to regroup and monitor health, transition to quarantine if needed, etc. No one should be FORCED to attend or work in-person. That said, this is a big IF, as some evidence is coming out saying that either for structural or genetic reasons, it may be young people of color worst affected by COVID-19 or MIS-C, just as for adults."

2020-07-01 17:59,"Unfortunately, there are are no good solutions. In my community, the district is planning for a full return to school. In their model students will be required to wear masks all day and practice social distancing.  How can we demand this if from our children when adults can’t get it right?  I hope I’m wrong but I don’t  believe this model is sustainable.  This spring we had no option but to quickly switch to distance learning.  Now is the time to improve distance education so we are prepared for the upcoming academic year."
2020-07-01 18:00,"Title I Teacher here. Would love to return to the classroom in the fall, as would most of my students, but I have yet to hear anything resembling a science-based plan that can bring us back safely under conditions of wide community spread. The total vacuum of national leadership and marginalization of science makes me worried for myself and all of us in those buildings in the fall and their families. So many of my students are already going through loss and trauma and have lost parents, siblings, and other family members. They need mental health services.  Bringing students back into an unsafe situation because we want to is not a plan."
2020-07-01 18:13,"Thank you for this perspective, from the parent of a 4 year old who started back at his daycare two weeks ago. After three months cooped up in the house with his parents, my son was starting to go a little insane. It was sad, and hard to describe, but he got to a point where he was listless and grumpy and caring for him devolved into daily (almost hourly) struggles over every little thing. We had some moments together during quarantine that I'm not proud of. Now that he's back at school playing with his friends he's like his old self again.

Nobody is going to be 100% safe from this thing until there's a vaccine, which everybody says is 18+ months away. I shudder to think about the long term effects on my son of him spending 20-25% of his natural life quarantined at home. I'm a professor who is currently expecting to teach classes of ~50 students in person starting in August, so I understand the risk and the trepidation that teachers feel, especially those at high risk of the virus. But I don't think we should make a blanket decision (keeping schools closed) based on the varied risk profile of teachers. One of my son's beloved teachers, for instance, has not returned because she is significantly higher risk than the others. I get that allowing for that type of flexibility is going to be hard in a big public school system, but keeping millions of kids cooped up in the house is going to be much harder."

2020-07-01 17:54,"First, the rate of overall community infection matters. If I lived in South Korea I would not hesitate to send my daughter to school. The Koreans are successfully managing the coronavirus. By comparison the U.S. has done an atrociously bad job. This reality gives us pause. Could you imagine trying to open the schools in Houston or Phoenix, today? If you can’t—if you can’t imagine closing the local bar but not the local school, then we’re talking matters of degrees of risk to which you’re willing to subject your child. 

The AAP’s report is silent on this issue. Why?

Second, PCR testing matters. We’re finding that as colleges invite athletes back for summer conditioning, some percentage test positive for the coronavirus. Knowing this, every school should have some means of PCR pooled testing in place for students and staff X number of days ahead of opening. Every school should then have a schedule of follow up testing that reflects the epidemiology of the disease. By comparison, temperature checks are public health theater. 

The AAP’s report punts on this possibility. Why?

Third, air handling matters. The HVAC system may qualify as the least sexy part of the school experience. However, when the weather turns cold and outdoor activities come to an end, we’ll find ourselves wholly reliant on how well the schools have been able to upgrade their air handling systems. Aerosol science finds itself in the limelight. 

The AAP report: no comment. Why?"
2020-07-01 18:00,"This is why I unfortunately don't trust the public administrators in this country: we didn't ""know"" masks helped in March? At that point, we had 3 months' worth of data points in China, Korea, Italy, all telling anyone who would listen, wear a mask. The problem is we often don't listen to other countries and in this case, at the cost of many lives. I wonder what we'll have ""discovered"" in a few more months that make this current guidance inaccurate or worse, unsafe. Count me out of sending any of my children to school until there's a vaccine."
2020-07-01 18:17,"As long-term teacher, I  agree with Dr. O'Leary on the importance of getting kids into schools,  but I'm insulted & alarmed by his answer to the issue that some teachers ""feel that their health is treated as expendable.""

But teacher health is a MEDICAL question, an important one."
2020-07-01 18:32,"I'm a teacher and Dr. O'Leary's assertions seem reasonable for someone like me. Still, I don't have anyone at home that needs to be protected. I feel like this all goes back to March when there was the debate over whether to close schools or not. It was a weighing of risks. Remote learning wasn't fun or easy but it was the right thing to do. Our school communities need to be safe. The pushback on remote learning is understandable due to the burden it placed on families, its disjointed nature and for the psychological implications of isolating children from their peers. Not to mention the digital divide along socioeconomic lines that left far too many students behind. I can't help but feel that the same voices that question a snow day or a delayed opening also question remote learning. Those in leadership positions need to make hard decisions that weigh benefits to risks. Those I've known over the years do a good job of making sure that those decisions put students at the center. I hope that whatever happens in the fall is the best possible set of decisions for students. But all of it makes me anxious if not downright scared. Some of those feelings are about the health of school communities. Some of those feelings are about what school will be like with the level of safety precautions that will have to be in place. I love teaching. I'm going to be a teacher no matter what happens. But this fall is going to be incredibly challenging."

By Dana Goldstein

I'm a high school student and I'm against reopening schools. The reason why I'm against this is because people are more comfortable at home than at school. Being comfortable at home can help students concentrate more. Students would be safer from covid-19. Being at school with the virus still going around can have student's health at risk."
2020-07-01 18:49,"As an educator, I find this article and the one you published that was an interview about epidemiologists' opinions about summer activities, camps, and childcare very frustrating. To me it seems like medical professionals and the CDC are abdicating their expertise and leaving decision making up to superintendents who have NO background in medicine, public health, or epidemiology.  

Cases are rising precipitously in my state yet my district is allowing summer sports teams to practice. I've driven by the fields where the football, volleyball and boys and girls soccer are all out with zero observable social distancing.  

I work with many people aged 50  on my staff. I have seen zero announcements from my state about how to protect staff health. It's hard NOT to hear from medical professionals that our health is expendable, with illness and symptoms lasting for months and causing permanent damage to survivors. 

I have a hard time imagining teaching with a mask on, enforcing that with my students, insisting they stay separate from each other, or how I can meaningfully teach lab-based science courses with equipment shared by 120 students.

I hate the way this pandemic has been mismanged since the beginning.  All approaches have been local, piecemeal, and ultimately ineffective. I've had coursework in epidemiology and immunology as a biology major and educator, and this is a joke asking people not educated and without expertise for their input.

Tacking a homeschool curriculum on top of my regular workday is a major undertaking that has me worried... but it’s also one where I know my child will have a safe learning experience, won’t bring anything home, and we have the privilege to do this together. I know it’s not an option for many, but if I can keep my kid out to make more space for the kids who are safer in school, I feel like it’s our duty to do it."
2020-07-01 19:22,"The American Academy of Pediatrics advice sending students back to school but state ""We’re pediatricians. We’re not educators. We don’t want to tread in space where we don’t belong."" Maybe they would like to donate the funds that would make our schools safe to reopen. I teach at a middle school which is title 1 meaning high poverty. My district pays the least amount in salaries, has aging and dirty HVAC systems and doesn't give us soap, sanitizers, or tissues. As single subject teachers, we see anywhere from 150-190 students a day with a class average of 34. I will go back to the classroom when they space the desks 6 feet apart, mandatory masks (admin taking care of the ones who refuse), temperature checks, someone to clean and sanitize between classes, and plexiglass around my desk. I am over 60 and I have a husband who has only 1 kidney (donated his other) and was treated for cancer. I have and would love to continue innovating lessons online. Everyone acts like having students temporarily learn this way is detrimental but it's TEMPORARY, not forever. Maybe not the parents, but the kids will be fine."

2020-07-01 19:44,"When is the last time anyone from the American Academy of Pediatrics visited a school? They seem to think children act the way they did in an early 1900s one room schoolhouse. Times have changed. Students of all ages move around the classroom, interact and work with each other, handle manipulatives, run, bounce, hit, roll, spit, kick. Let's get real here.

No children can learn if the teachers are dead."
2020-07-01 19:44,"I'm frustrated by teachers who comment on these sorts of articles upset that parents are treating school ""like child care,"" saying that they aren't in the business of child care. That's ridiculous. Of course schools are child care! Our entire society is built around the model of children being supervised at school. Our objectives in sending children to school are multifaceted, including providing them with skills and knowledge necessary to succeed in life. But also taking care of them during the day while their parents are at work -- that's another vital role that schools play, in the society we have developed for ourselves.

I also saw a comment from a teacher saying the AAP is prioritizing children's ""social lives"" over teachers' well being. It's not about the ""social lives"" of children. It's about their development, education, and mental health. What these comments need to realize is that teachers are fully capable of following guidelines to wear masks and wash their hands and distance themselves particularly from other adults, and that doing so provides them with significant protection. The risk will never be zero, but all evidence points to this scenario being quite safe. Teachers who truly feel uncomfortable going back to the classroom should have alternatives provided. But this sense of antagonism, ""us vs. them"" is inappropriate. The goal is to keep everybody safe, to protect children's development, and yes - unashamedly - to allow society to function more normally."
2020-07-01 19:48,"Comments here from the general public and education professionals make crystal clear what the article already showed on its own.

This pre-emptive volley from pediatricians (disclaimers notwithstanding) — sounding off in these pages before the voices of teachers and administrators — is remarkably tone deaf and skirts the critical mechanics of a very complex issue. 

To wit, where community spread is suppressed by good hygiene and a strong public health test & trace regimen, schools are opening safely.

I am seeking similar articles where Amazon suppliers or customers were showcased before articles on the warehouse workers themselves, for instance.

Why is it that writers and citizens in general presume — as above average highly-informed consumers and connoisseurs of education services, of course — that they can adequately write about the field without amplifying the voices of those most immediately affected?

Why now? Why so often before now? Should it continue into the future? One would hope not.

2020-07-01 20:08,"So, college aged kids (17-21 year olds) who go out and party are major spreaders, and contractors but, suddenly, 14-18 year old High School students don't present much risk to any of us or themselves? How can both of these scenarios be true at the same time?"
2020-07-01 20:19,"Of course having everyone back is school is preferred, and yes ""most"" kids and young adults will do fine if they catch Covid.

Who is to say that one of my kids seemingly comes out scott-free and 30 years down the line suffers from debilitating after-effects that are as of yet unknown?  Why would I put my children at risk that way?

Furthermore, even if kids are barely affected, this is not lord of the flies. Adults are there, too, many of whom would be put in extreme danger.  As a former teacher myself, I can tell you that kids are little petri dishes and that new teachers are constantly ill with viruses picked up from students.  I want my children in school, yes, but at what cost?"
2020-07-01 20:40,"This guideline seems oblivious to what happens in a normal fall and winter: respiratory viral infections and asthma flares.

What we don’t need during a pandemic in 2020-21 fall-winter is influenza and other viruses spreading throughout the community with the aid of classrooms and unnecessary/random organized sports. 

A simple cold is going to cause chaos.

Imagine if we continue the stay at home with some relaxed measures into fall, hope for more science to kick in, give hospital/urgent care centers/frontline staff breathing room, lower incidence of ALL viral airborne illnesses for this fall.  Then, we can start of January 2021 in much better shape instead of this proposed plan—quite literally short-sighted and reveals the ego of AAP."
2020-07-01 20:41,"Love this balance take on risks vs benefits!  I don't think our goal is to eliminate transmission--not possible--but to very carefully weight which risks are worth it and which ones aren't.

Keep the restaurants and bars closed, keep the bans on large social gatherings.  Open the schools.

Will someone somewhere get COVID in school?  Yes, but we can mitigate turning that into full-fledged outbreaks.  Meanwhile, the benefits of having kids in school is so essential.

We don't insist that no one is allowed to drive until we can guarantee safety from cars.  Instead, we take measures to increase safety of driving, and accept the remaining risk in light of the benefits of having a mobility.

Why are we opening other things up if we won't open schools?  Boggles my mind.  Our leaders should have stated from the get-go that reopening schools was a top priority, and all decisions about opening other things would take into account the impact on our ability to reopen schools."
2020-07-01 18:52,"Strange. Last night both Dr. Fauci and Dr. Reade --both lifelong specialists in pandemics-- were interviewed. Although the topic was not about opening schools, per se, it was about what conditions MUST be in place for anyone, young or old, to be safe. I think I'll stick with them.

Here are their guidelines: 

1. Avoid being indoors as much as possible. (Impossible in a school setting.)
2. Avoid settings where talking, shouting, singing take place (impossible in school).
3. Do not stay in the same room/setting for more than an hour (ditto)
4. Masks must be worn at all times (impossible if eating and drinking are happening).

Schools self-evidently fail on all four points. 

As a teacher, I began the summer relatively optimistic, assuming I would be back in school in the fall. It's almost impossible to express how much we teachers want this. There is no corollary for being together in a shared space. We all know that and want it.

 As a rational thinker, I now concede there is no safe way to do this. At this point, I hope my school makes the decision sooner rather than later to go on-line so that we can begin preparing.

 At this point, I have no idea how to prepare for the fall or have any sense of what is coming, though I think we're in for a dire year. There is one thing I am absolutely sure about. It is not worth risking students and teachers over a year. Skills can be gained, lost work can be made up, but the dead are the dead forever."
2020-07-01 18:45,"There seems to be a lot of emphasis on the learning loss taking place with remote schooling, and yet there is very little discussion of the learning loss that would take place when educators contract COVID-19 due to an unsafe return. Who will teach our students when their teachers are out sick for weeks? 

There is no ideal situation here and we can’t let our frustration and fatigue over the current situation influence our decisions. Yes, it can be overwhelming for parents to have children at home, and yes, instances of child abuse are on the rise, and yet putting the lives of our children’s educators at risk is not the solution.

I would love to see alternatives. Maybe this is the opportunity to redesign the structures and content of schooling rather than simply returning to our status quo."
2020-07-01 21:44,"If we hadn’t reopened bars, restaurants, and retail, we might have been able to salvage this upcoming school year. Instead, leaders across the country opened for business. Now we are seeing record numbers of cases - new records seemingly being set every day. 

You can recite to me all the countries that successfully reopened schools - but all those countries had control of the virus before they reopened, and we do not. You can tell me kids don’t get sick or spread COVID like adults do - I accept that scientific evidence, but that still leaves a lot of adults in schools that can get each other sick, and we know that, while rare, yes, kids can get sick too, especially when social distancing is impossible, which is the case in most schools.

No, given the budget situations and logistics of schools, it is not safe to reopen. This will have far-reaching economic consequences, because many parents can’t go back to work if schools aren’t open and in person full time.

We threw the school year away for the sugar high of going out for drinks and a day at the beach. What an intelligent country we are."
2020-07-01 20:08,"Older teacher here. At least a quarter of American teachers are over 50, and according to U.S. News, one-third of the nation's teaching force has pre-existing conditions that put them at higher risk for COVID-19 complications. While I agree that in-person schooling is much better for student learning and also serves a childcare function for working parents, I feel like I'm being asked to risk my life, kill my husband, or impoverish my family. I work in a small space with small groups of students who need to see my lips and vocalize. Thousands of Special Educators, ESL teachers, and Reading Specialists are like me. Moreover, particularly when working in K-8 schools, I wonder if the public understands that students do not sit at desks most of day in most schools. They move around. They touch and manipulate objects, cards, legos, papers, etc. They move to rugs and small tables to have discussions.They don't stay in one space either. They go to the bathroom, the music room, the art room, the library, PE, and touch objects and each other. Within the first fifteen minutes of school at least one-quarter of students won't be wearing their masks, or wearing them the correct way. Young children won't be wearing masks at all. And even if teachers lives are expendable, what will happen when a child dies and his parents sue the school system? I do not feel safe. The plans, so far, are worthless. We should receive extra pay at least."

Just let that sink in as a reflection of our society: the AAP wants children to be congregated in a school rather than in their own home to reduce risk of abuse, injury or death to children despite an ever increasing pandemic. What a sad reflection of our society that children are less at risk crammed into a 35 child Petri dish than in their own home!"

2020-07-01 19:58,"so many of these comments are one-dimensional and based on a position of privilege (I was grateful the APA stepped up to the plate). there's a demonstrated correlation bet. years of education and longevity, and huge disruptions greatly increase the drop-off rate etc. so these people yapping abt public health seem to be only tracking one impact."
2020-07-01 20:11,"I don't understand why a teacher feels entitled to be exempt from providing essential services? Kids need to be in school. No one signed up to work during a pandemic. Physicians, grocery store clerks, bus drivers, etc are all still working. If teachers are getting a government pay check, then they should be at school doing their jobs."
2020-07-01 21:09,"The AAP recommendations are broad, nonspecific, and for the most part, not referenced from scientific literature. September is only two months away and the AAP has no plan. Physicians excel in treatment of the sick, not prevention, and that is the problem with their recommendations. School districts are grappling with significant loss of revenue that will be needed to increase staff and modernize buildings. COVID  management and prevention will cost money. Trump and his henchman in the Senate have no interest in this issue at all. Leave it to the states? It is time to look elsewhere for guidance on school reopening. Our European neighbors are managing, and we can learn from their experience. There is an excellent Danish model, and in Australia, children have been back at school for weeks. These countries have approached reopening with phased measures based in science that are continuously monitored from by central government. US school districts need concrete recommendations now, not guidelines. Broad recommendations are just not enough."
2020-07-01 21:31,"Here's something interesting though. Hospitals employ thousands of people and have been open throughout without workplace COVID spread. Since universal mask-wearing began in mid-March, there have been few if any documented cases of contracting COVID in well-run hospital or clinic workplaces. Even at Massachusetts General Hosptial, which took care of many hundreds of known COVID patients, as documented by Dr. Atul Gawande in the New Yorker in late May. 
I work as a pediatrician at a large academic health system. We have had no workplace spread of COVID since we began universal masking. While working in late March was admittedly a little unnerving, working now is not at all. I feel completely and totally safe while taking all the precautions-- and yes, I am sometimes within three feet of patients and co-workers in hospital rooms, in the physician workroom and at the nurses' station. Children and teens do not spread this virus--adults do.  But with limiting contact with other adults, masking, hand washing and not touching one's face-- it goes okay. 
I am very proud to be a member of the AAP and very glad they have published evidence-based, safe, holistic guidelines that are not based on anxiety. Teachers and pediatricians are both essential workers for child and community health. We can all do this together."

2020-07-01 22:24,I have a child with multiple disabilities who needs close supervision at all times. Online learning absolutely does not work for him. Trying to work remotely without any childcare is incredibly challenging and would be impossible if there weren't two of us able to switch off between caregiving and working. We have managed for 3 1/2 months and can power through the rest of the summer but we NEED school to re-open in the fall- it is simply not sustainable to continue this arrangement indefinitely. All of the laws and resources usually available to support families like mine have been thrown out the window.  We are on our own and we need help- that too is a pressing public health crisis.
2020-07-01 22:36,"'First do no harm' is the oath Drs pledge, parents being able to work is important, but is not the primary focus of clinicians. 
Where is the data?, few children have be tested for the virus or its antibodies so we know Dr O'Leary's view is not based in peer reviewed clinical journals.
Putting out an opinion with no way to implement it is not responsible.  When the second wave comes during our normal flu season, I hope there is more data on which to make sound and responsible policy. 
Schools primary role is to provide a safe place for children to learn, not to provide daycare.  Given the surge going on during the summer, a time when it was theorized should have been lower incidence of the virus, imagine what we will see in a time when viruses are most active. 
By Thanksgiving I doubt anyone children will be in classrooms and we need to be prepared."
2020-07-01 22:56,"Pediatricians seem to be basing this rash recommendation on their own childhood experiences.  The current crop of kids manage to get and stay socially connected virtually. Next year, when we must trust that COVID-19 will be mostly a bad memory, they can meet up in the flesh again, crowd schoolrooms and hallways, play sports in the schoolyard and experience childhood in the old fashioned way.  Now is not the time for that.  Too many lives are at stake."
2020-07-01 23:10,"I'm a healthy 66 year old retired early grades elementary teacher.  There is no need for me to decide since I wasn't going  back anyway.  A lot of the teachers I knew were older and a good number did have health problems.  With the virus numbers going up, it is surprising to hear them say that school can open in the fall.  The children certainly do need to be in school.  Parents need professional teachers caring for the children so that they can work.  We also need to put an end to this pandemic.  It is frankly hard to believe that putting lots of people in classrooms, what amounts to boxing them up together, is safe.  It sounds too good to be true, and I am not convinced that it is true."
2020-07-01 21:51,"I am a teacher.  There will be students and parents who will not choose to wear a mask or will take it off.  Even when mandated.  So when that kiddo sneezes on your kiddo, what then?  Will the police escort that kiddo out?  Will everyone be tested?  Will the test results be available immediately or will that take weeks? Will there be a quarantine?  What happens to the teachers quarantining for 14 days?  Substitutes roam multiple districts.  They are awesome viral vectors!  Regular subs cost money districts don't have.  What then? What if the sneezer tests positive? What if they took the bus to school? What if one bus driver transports 200 in five bus runs daily?  Does that mean, every one of those 200 kiddos will quarantine?  Will the district test those kiddos too?   Who will pay for the tests? What if the families don't have insurance?  Will the district pay? (Schools didn't get a bailout from the feds.) These are the questions one sneeze may generate.  I would love to see physicians of the AAP answer these specific questions for every district rather than sidestepping the can of worms they have opened.  

America has disinvested in it's schools for years.  This is now becoming painfully clear as most have insufficient if any resources to open safely. That the AAP is so out of touch with the real state of America's schools speaks volumes. 

I wonder how many of the doctors in the AAP have children attending their neighborhood school?"
2020-07-01 22:03,"Dr. O'Leary should spend some time in a typical classroom and find out how ludicrous his suggestions for following C.D.C .guidelines with a group of active school kids is. And why should any schoolteacher put their lives at risk based on his unproven estimates of child covid safety? Another period of waiting out the course of this deadly pandemic is the better way to go. And maybe when it's time to get the kids back up to speed, we can institute some much need reforms in our sorry educational system. I suggest the good doctor read the story of his namesake, Mrs. O'Leary, and how she burned down the city of Chicago while milking her cow.

Opening up the schools IS the safe and life saving option. Yes, this involves more risk for teachers in exchange for less risk for students. Multiple teachers have stated in the comments that this is tantamount to making them kill their partners, but by the same logic, if they stay home they are killing their students."
2020-07-01 23:14,"When our children go to school every fall, they are exposed to and spread the flu, colds, and every other illness. They can't help but also spread them to their teachers. They also bring the illnesses home - throughout the entire school year. At the same time, working parents are spreading illnesses in the workplace and bringing those home too. Many homes are also shared with grandmothers and grandfathers or possibly relatives, brothers or sisters at high risk. This year that same phenomenon, except in the form of Covid-19, will be no different, but potentially much worse.  Research, scientific breakthroughs and treatments are constantly evolving and improving - and perhaps a vaccine is on the horizon.  For now, while a bit more difficult for some, it just seems prudent to keep our children home.  We will know more as we go forward and could be very glad we waited."
2020-07-01 23:24,"I’d like to see more thinking out of the box about what education could look like this fall, beyond go back to school or do zoom classes.

Are there changes we can make to the curriculum itself that make remote learning more engaging, like having a science class where students explore and catalogue their neighborhood plants, birds, insects? What about shifting emphasis from consuming information (which can be less engaging online) to creating and communicating across different subjects?

What are more creative ways we can use technology like apps, virtual reality, or even social media to support learning?

Are there non traditional places we can repurpose for learning experiences? A masked and distanced visit to a sculpture garden, an arboretum or nature reserve? An unused stadium, conference center, large auditorium for an in person intensive seminar?

Maybe we’ve become too rigid about what learning can look like, and this is an opportunity to explore new approaches."

2020-07-01 23:47,"They seem to be making some unproven assumptions regarding children not being as susceptible to COVID and do not spread the virus to others as much as adults. That hasn't been proven or accepted by experts. It is generally felt the only reason children are not getting the virus at a higher rate is that they haven't been in school and even if they did get the virus they weren't tested since they most likely won't show symptoms. There is no evidence that they don't transmit the virus to others at the same rate as adults at all. 

We need to be focusing on how the online learning processes can be improved to fully engage the students and faculty, as others like Heidi has discussed. With the current spike in cases and the anticipated future spread of the virus, I don't believe we even have any other choice than to limit exposure in any way possible. A vaccine is not coming soon enough and the virus is not going to just disappear. Less than 10% of the US population has contracted the virus thus far and with that low percentage we still have over 125,000 deaths. We have to slow this down and buy some time if we are going to mitigate the death toll."

School professionals will be exposed over and over again.  I have been teaching for 25+ years, and I have 5 more until retirement.  I make about 65K a year.  I have about 150 high school students in 5 sections of English every year, and spend much of my evenings and weekends correcting writing.  Most of my students are amazing, but I have been sworn at, screamed at, taken abuse from parents on many occasions, with little support from administration. Teachers have been taking hits for about a decade, being blamed for every social ill that no bureaucrat, community, or parent can seem to fix.  We are now supposed to stop bullets and risk a deadly virus because teachers are expected to be saintly and selfless, earn a BA and an MA, and all for less after 25 years than most finance majors will make their first year out of college.  And we wonder why there is a teacher shortage."
2020-07-02 1:13,"I am shocked by Dr. Leary's cavalier response regarding the safety of children and teachers returning to school in the fall.  School settings are social environments by their nature.  Having worked in a school setting for 25 years,  the task of having students in a school building and requiring that they wear masks and socially distance from each other is an almost impossible task.  Who will be most at risk in schools come the fall?  It will be our teachers; the people who have committed their lives to the academic, social and emotional development of the children that they teach and care for.  We say as a society that we value and respect teachers and yet, we are willing to put them at significant risk to expose them to children who may be asymptomatic or may even be affected.  How many teachers will need to get the coronavirus and possibly die before we realize that the plan of returning to school this fall was a poor choice.  The concentration right now for school administrators should be on strengthening online teacher methods and providing computer equipment to all children so that they have the ability to access online teaching. When there is a vaccine or a medication to treat the coronavirus, that should be the time to return to a school building. There will be time enough to catch students up in the areas that may need to be addressed.  Let us value and care about our educators now so that our children will continue to have teachers in the future."

Education is ESSENTIAL for physical and mental health for kids. Period. Mortality for this disease is largely among those with comorbidities and the elderly and we know kids play a VERY small role in spread. The shutdown will also result in an enormous spike of child deaths in developing nations because our shutdown is crippling medical care in many parts of the world, and will cause mass starvation.

The shutdown for this pandemic will result in lifelong damage to kids’ wellbeing, in the end it will all amount to just another massive diversion of global wealth resources for the wealthy elderly in first world countries. In the process it will enrich tech companies who see nothing but dollar signs and profit opportunities in the debacle that has been distance “learning.” It’s senseless to put our kids last when we should be putting our children first. The AAP may be the only sane organization left. We are mortal, and the health of our kids is the only future. Shame on you NYT for your pandemic profiteering."
2020-07-02 5:22,"I was surprised to hear AP are promoting a return to school buildings in the fall. There is no sign that a science based, systematic, thoughtful approach to return will be put in place in the next 2 months. Furthermore, in the news today is story of an outbreak at a childcare center in the Portland area shows exactly what will happen. There are now 28 cases of children, staff, and family members who have contracted the virus. <a href=""https://www.koin.com/news/health/coronavirus/20-covid-19-cases-confirmed-at-lake-oswego-kindercare/amp"" target=""_blank"">https://www.koin.com/news/health/coronavirus/20-covid-19-cases-confirmed-at-lake-oswego-kindercare/amp</a>/"
2020-07-02 7:09,"Once again, schools are coerced to be more than simply educational, devoted and dedicated to deliver the basics of knowledge and skills. 

Rather, they are again compelled to become tools and harbingers of Social engineering, political weapons of conservatives and progressives, laden to be societal problem solvers.... 

These are far more than schools were ever designed for, and far beyond their capacity. 

As a society, we need to focus our educational system in a precise and clear manner. It cannot be all things to all people, lest it crumble under the weight. 

As a public school teacher for 30 years, elementary through state college, I know of what I speak."
2020-07-02 8:50,"This has me genuinely curious: parents who state their children are at home, depressed and without social outlets, longing for in-person school in the fall. If you're not concerned about the virus, why can't your children socialize now? Even if some activities and venues are shut down, they can at least invite their friends over to the house. And if school is online in the fall, your child can continue to socialize. Children's social needs can be met without being in a classroom."
2020-07-02 14:31,"Thank you AAP! This is one of the best things I've read in weeks, and I appreciate the AAP's research-based, level-headed, and whole-child approach. I also appreciate the journal articles that this piece links to. It seems that many of the commenters (at least the ones I could bear to read) didn't read the full article. The crux of the decision to recommend in-classroom schooling is whether children infect one another, AND whether they can spread the disease even if they themselves are largely asymptomatic. If people will take time to read the whole article, AND the linked sources, you may be heartened by the large body of research suggesting ""kids really do seem to be both less likely to catch the infection and less likely to spread the infection. It seems to be even more true for younger kids, under 10 or under 12. And older kids seem to play less of a role than adults."" (paragraph 8)."
2020-07-02 15:35,"I'm an elementary teacher in the Denver area.  While I don't think online school is best, I also don't believe kids lost months of learning.  We have 3 weeks of testing every spring that takes away from learning along with lots of end of year activities.  

Additionally, it is a parent's job to help their child stay engaged.  A positive about the online school experience is we were able to see who could actually learn independently given the tools.  So many people want to learn without much effort, ""Tell me what I need to know, so I don't have to think.""  

When I read things like kids aren't getting food at home, they might be mistreated at home, or this is affecting their mental health, I am a bit miffed.  Since when did a school become all of these things.  Parents chose to have children.  These things are their responsibilities not the schools.  

Finally, if school is so important and must be opened in the fall, why aren't politicians discussing funding schools fully.  States have been greatly impacted economically by this pandemic.  Not only that, but schools weren't fully funded before the pandemic.  

It turns out that schools are essential to our society both from a social perspective and an economic perspective.  School costs money.  It's time for a school bailout.  If we can bailout big business, and that's a high priority, we can fully fund schools."

2020-07-02 15:56,"The conclusion is the most telling part. They finally come out and say it! Schools must continue to be free childcare providers for society. 
""Reopening schools is so important for the kids, but really for the entire community. So much of our world relies on kids being in school and parents being able to work.""

Stop forcing educational institutions to be all things for society. We as a nation should have free childcare for working parents. But instead of doing that, we are willing to put our children and our educators in harms way to avoid fixing the actual problem. 

For those of you touting his ""research""? Here's CURRENT data. And that's very important in dealing with this very fluid, constantly changing virus. 
From the Texas Tribune:
""As of Tuesday, there were 950 reported positive cases of COVID-19 — 307 children and 643 staff members — at 668 child care locations. Statewide, 12,207 licensed child care operations are open, and total reported coronavirus cases have risen from 59 cases in mid-May and 576 on June 23."""
2020-07-02 14:34,"Guess who funds the American Academy of Pediatrics? Here are some of the top donors listed on their website. It's a who's who of big pharma and many of them are hoping to profit off of COVID:

Abbott - makes a COVID test
Merck & Co.
AstraZeneca UK
Johnson & Johnson - working on a COVID vaccine
GlaxoSmithKline - working on a COVID vaccine and treatment
Genentech a Member of the Roche Group - Roche is working 
    on a COVID vaccine, treatment and test
Janssen Infectious Diseases
Sanofi - working on a COVID vaccine and treatment
Supernus Pharmaceuticals, Inc.

I'm sure it's just a coincidence and the AAP would never, ever be influenced by the money that keeps the organization alive. But it's not clear how their plan was developed. It doesn't say on their site who authored it or who they consulted for it or if any experts reviewed it and it doesn't contain any references from the scientific literature to support their recommendations.   

I get it, kids are falling behind and we need a return to school. But we have an incompetent administration that is doing nothing about COVID except making it worse and cases are surging in 20+ states. Opening schools in that context is going to be tricky and it's likely to be impossible without causing cases of severe illness and death in teachers, principals, parents, extended family members, and even kids. Maybe, just maybe, guidance for reopening should come from an expert group that isn't tied to companies that stand to profit off it."
2020-07-02 15:52,I read that the MMR vaccine might be playing a role in protecting the children from COVID.  Is this true? Shall we role out for adults?
2020-07-02 15:37,"If parents could view their children's teachers as - say, their mother, father, or favorite aunt or uncle - how would they feel about having that loved one in harm's way every single day?  Many school buildings are old, decrepit, and have windows that can't be opened.  Bathroom facilities are tight, halls narrow.  Most teachers I know miss their students, miss their work, but are frankly terrified to envision going back to school in the midst of the pandemic.  I used to work in the schools - usually in poor districts - and I worry for them as much as I feel for the children and families ""stuck"" at home."
2020-07-02 15:37,"Please all look at the CDC numbers. We are still at 14 deaths in TOTAL for the USA for kids 5 to 14 years. This is a very, very small number for deaths by any cause and we rarely see this key number printed in the acres of news and comments. Also the evidence is mounting very quickly that these kids are not the spreaders of the virus (like they are for common flu). Yes there is a risk to older teachers we need to address but the overall risk looks quite small compared to the negative implications to Children that the AAP rightly highlights."
2020-07-02 13:42,"This is a political statement and a heinously stupid one.   Every doctor and public health official knows that children in school is a key way disease spreads in a community.   The fact few children are clinically ill has little to do with them spreading it!   And parents of children who DO get more than a little sick won't thank you!  

My doctor, who was also my village's public health officer, always said winter break occurred at just the right time, it stopped the spread of what was going around.

The American Academy of Pediatrics is going to regret saying such a thing - those among them capable of regretting anything!    

The proposals of half day school and some students in school, some learning at home, look good to me."

2020-07-01 16:49,That's exactly how the 1918 flu spread. Large numbers of soldiers were transferred from one place to another.  They spread the infection from one continent to another.
2020-07-01 16:37,"Sadly, this is an excellent case study of how a virus is spread throughout a population: crowding too closely together; little or no hand washing; no mask wearing.
For those who still think they are invulnerable, or this pandemic is a hoax, take warning!"
2020-07-01 16:36,"It is cruel and unusual punishment to place someone at substantial risk for catching a potentially fatal illness.

We should start releasing prisoners instead of transferring them and creating outbreaks of a deadly virus.

We incarcerate too many people in this country already.  We should keep the pedophiles and other rapists locked up, but release the drug offenders and non-violent criminals with time served."
2020-07-01 16:58,"If I become infected, I'll be quarantined at home with the rest of my family that will likely be infected as well.  That's the facts.  It was stupid to move positive inmates to another jail.  But, jail is quarantine, and we must not release criminals onto the streets to quarantine (and infect, as they will not follow the rules; that's already a given)."
2020-07-01 17:06,Do not be surprised to see this scenario replay when schools reopen.
2020-07-01 17:33,"This is only the tip of the iceberg.  The CDCR then transferred San Quentin prisoners to a prison in Susanville, in rural Lassen County - and did not quarantine them from the prison population.  As of yesterday, there were 214 inmates in the Susanville prison with COVID diagnoses, and three prison staff with diagnoses.  The hospital in Susanville has only 25 beds.  All of Lassen County is officially in a local health emergency because of CDCR's continuing recklessness."
2020-07-01 17:37,"This is also a cautionary warning about screening people by simply taking temperatures and asking if they feel sick, as some airlines and many businesses are doing.  The majority of transmissions occurs by people who have no fever or other symptoms.  40-50% of infected people never get sick but can still infect others, and  those who do get sick are highly infectious in the days before they begin feeling bad.   
Obviously, the prisoner transfer was botched by not testing the incoming prisoners, but even testing isn't foolproof because someone can test negative soon after being infected, then go on to infect others as the virus multiplies.  This is one nasty disease in so many ways."
2020-07-01 17:42,"There is an additional tragedy here not discussed in the article.  In addition to the serious health risks to inmates at San Quentin is the risk to prison staff (I read at least 40 have been infected) who are in the community (notice the uptick in cases in the bay area including marin county).  In addition,  inmates who are seriously ill are being distributed to hospitals in the bay area reducing critical care availability for the community.  All in all this was a really stupid decision to move the prisoners from chino state prison."
2020-07-01 17:49,"What this article fails to mention is the massive impact this outbreak will have on Marin and Bay Area hospitals. There was no plan to deal with this - vague plans for air conditioned tents. San Quentin should have a military field hospital set up to be able to treat and manage the sick prisoners to try and mitigate the hospitalization issue.  I also think that Matt Willis, our top health official, does NOT get a pass on being responsible for containing this outbreak.  He says, ""state prison officials had told him they were capable of handling the virus on their own"" and that it was ""not part of (his) jurisdiction”.  Huh?  So he just ""believed"" them when they said they could handle it on their own?  And the issue was with who has authority, Willis should made that conflict public (and in the news) months ago.  I've lived in Marin my entire life, and if I thought of San Quentin as a covid petri dish back in the Spring, I sure presumed that my public health official did (but apparently not). This passive, buck-passing public health approach of Willis (""oh there is nothing we can do"") is not acceptable in the Bay Area - where we lead in the early months of the epidemic and must continue to lead. We've had months of CDC leadership tip-toeing around Trump  - and that means our local health officials have to be even more assertive and step up - to protect everyone (whether free or in prison)."
2020-07-01 18:07,"This whole operation is illogical. Prisoners were moved, and in other cases, released, because they allegedly cannot be isolated from each other.  An infected person may not test positive for multiple days after exposure and it often takes multiple days to process the test, during all of which time a person may be contagious. So the only way to guarantee not transferring the virus would be to isolate all the prisoners being moved both before and after their tests. So if that’s possible, why not just leave them where they are, safely isolated. Maybe the government has some secret giant stash of instant result tests and the staff to process them. If so I’d rather they be used to protect nurses and other essential workers over convicted felons."
2020-07-01 18:31,"There really are no success stories so far this year for the US. That's not to discount efforts by medical professionals and individual anecdotes of recovery, but on a big scale, our public health efforts are an abject failure. Americans should expect better. Americans should be able to do better as a society. So far, we have failed. Do ""We the People"" have what it takes to reverse course?"
2020-07-01 18:36,"Science obviously tells you not to bring people exposed to COVID into contact with those who don't have the virus.

2020-07-01 18:28,"I live close to Marin County, the site of San Quentin.  And I must say many of us vacillate between downright fear or anger, often  experiencing both emotions.  Our prison system in CA was in need of reform to begin with.  So, this is no surprise.  In the eyes of too many, including those actually employed by these institutions, the jailed are looked upon as being expendable, indeed, subhuman.  Who cares if they become ill and die on Covid-19's altar of devastation?  Yet, the ignorance - and irony - are profound, is it not, that while our prisoners are looked down upon and are so neglected, those very caretakers, guards, administrators, etc., are putting themselves and their own families at risk, too."
2020-07-01 18:41,"If this were a military operation, the head of California’s Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation - along with others - would be relieved of their command. 

By late April/early May, it was common knowledge that prisons and nursing homes were vector sites for the virus’ spread. Up until this prison transfer, Marin County had done a remarkable job of holding the virus at bay and keeping the infection rate low through a strict and effective quarantine. 

Yet, Dr. Matt Willis, our country’s public health officer, was essentially told to butt out and that San Quentin was “not part of (his) jurisdiction.”

Like the current president, California’s prisons had months to prepare for the inevitable and exponential spread of this virus. This prisoner transfer was unsafe and reckless. All those civilian employees at San Quentin are returning to families in Bay Area communities. One of them is a family member. 

The prison’s official statement that “safety is our top priority, as is the health of our community,” reads like a sinister and cruel joke. 

These prison officials must be held accountable."

2020-07-01 19:02,"I was a hospice/AIDS counselor at San Quentin during the AIDS pandemic in the eighties and nineties, along with Ram Das, The Marin AIDS Project and others.   The prison is a relic, and there is no way to protect either staff or inmates.  When there was a low bed count, the police were alerted in San Francisco and they would put out a call to fill the beds with the indigent and homeless in what was then called “The Tenderloin.”  

Some were so desperate for a bed they would throw a brick through a window to go back to prison for food.  We worked with Act Up to provide drugs and nursing for those who had the virus.  In other words, over eighty percent of those who were rounded up like cattle and put back with those who came from all over the country (San Quentin was a “Reception Center” for Level Ones to Level Fours, ie  murderers) were mentally ill.  Reagan shut down all mental health facilities in the eighties.  It is a cycle that has never been broken.

Most should never have gone there in the first place but we have made prison an economic engine with absolutely no moral compass to check it.  It is not Christian. And it is most certainly not American - not the America my father fought the Nazis for.  God help us."

Shouldn't sending untested, infected prisoners into another prison, where they then infect at least 1,000 prisoners, be treated as an act of criminal negligence? Or don't the deaths matter, because they are prisoners? 

Who exactly in the California Dept. of Corrections and Rehabilitation made the decision to transfer these inmates? There is no attempt here to identify the guilty parties."

I’ve been three months in social isolation reading a great deal and keeping up with what’s going on so I’m no “armchair specialist.” It’s vital to me in my state to keep informed. To keep abreast of developments.

2020-07-02 16:48,"Among the prisoners at San Quentin is 58-year old Harry Sassounian, who has been in prison since he was convicted at age 19 in 1982 for his role in the assassination of Turkish diplomat Kemal Arikan. He was granted parole twice after the Parole Boards found he no longer posed a threat or risk of harm to anyone. After spending nearly 4 decades in prison, they found the revenge-fueled rage of his stateless youth (he and his family were part of the post-1915 Genocide Armenian diaspora) had dissipated and he had grown and matured from an understandably angry 19-year old into a 58-year old who simply wanted to live out what remained of his life in the homeland of his people, Armenia. During his 38 years in prison, the assassinations of Turkish diplomats by Armenians, which began in 1973 in Santa Barbara, had achieved their goal of bringing the world's attention to the effectively forgotten Genocide of 1915 and Turkey's concerted efforts to cover it up. (Today genocide denialism is lucrative in and outside Turkey, and dangerous for those who challenge it.)

Unfortunately, Sassounian's 2 paroles were reversed reversed by California's governors pursuant to pressure from the Turkish government and Trump administration, as well as a patently false online lobbying campaign (no doubt financed by the Erdogan regime). Gov. Newsom's reversal was carried out on 5/25 at the height of the Covid-19 pandemic. His cave-in to Erdogan and Trump should haunt him, especially if dies from the virus."

But I can't help thinking that this is what happens when the person who is currently infecting the White House insults just about every European leader (other than his pal/owner Vlad)?  45 thought he didn't need Europe and decided to destroy relationships that had won two world wars.  Well, we'll see how he keeps them down on the farm now that they CAN'T see Paree."
2020-06-30 14:54,The inclusion of China demonstrates that the EU is more interested in political groveling than it is about public health. What a joke.
2020-06-30 15:20,Can't wait 'til I can buy a one-way ticket.
2020-06-30 15:08,"So embarrassing! The satellites that used to gravitate around the US are pulling out, like a mutiny against an incompetent leader. If this is not a sign of American decline then what is?"
2020-06-30 14:51,"I can't say I blame the EU for this decision, but on a personal note, this does destroy my travel plans to go to Italy in August.  Yet another Trump failure."
2020-06-30 15:13,Amazing that of all the countries in the Americas Uruguay is one of the only two allowed into the EU. Specially if you consider they are surrounded by Brazil and Argentina which are being ravaged by COVID 19. It would like to see the NYT publish an article on how this small country of very limited resources pulled it off.
2020-06-30 15:37,The natural consequences of immature policies.
2020-06-30 15:00,Have we made America great yet? This is utterly depressing and embarrassing to read. If we had a sane and science-based national COVID response with actual leadership from the White House we would not be here. Instead we’re fighting over masks. We deserve this. Time to go donate some more money to the Biden campaign.
2020-06-30 15:02,"Most of the Republican base does not even have a passport. They don’t care. 

The goal of the Republican Party is to isolate the USA.  That was the point. 

I am sure many conservatives would rather visit Russia anyway."
2020-06-30 15:30,"A hat tip to the Governors of Florida, Arizona and Texas for making the US pariah status possible.   Only by standing up against the scientific experts, failing to support mask use and closing late/ reopening prematurely was this possible."
2020-06-30 14:50,"So now we are not good enough for the Europeans? Thanks, Donald. Getting tired of winning."
2020-06-30 15:18,"The EU metric is essentially a humanity metric.  Do people in a country care about their neighbor enough to socially distance, wash their hands and wear a mask?  The USA has all kinds of advantages like low population density and the most money spent on health care.  What we don't have is leadership or a population that cares about wearing a mask more than its rights to assault rifles."
2020-06-30 15:22,"Thanks Mr. President, for putting us in such an amazing group with Brazil and Russia. How exclusive!

Trump has made the USA a third world nation in 3 years.  How long to repair it is anyone's guess."
2020-06-30 15:24,"I am American living now in Europe for nine years (have no intention to return to the U.S, by the way).

Each time I hear American English on the streets these days, it is extremely jarring.  I find myself thinking, don't let folks from that mismanaged country in here; keep 'em out!  We shouldn't suffer on account of them!"
2020-06-30 15:27,"Texas is home to American Airlines, Georgia to Delta- they both are bleeding cash and won't fully recover until they are flying widebody jets full of people to international destinations.   It will be at least a year before that resumes.  You would think that a ""business savvy"" President Donald Trump would know the quickest way for the economy to get to normal would be to get the virus under control as quickly as possible and restore global confidence in America and Americans."
2020-06-30 15:24,"Good. Maybe this will put more pressure on the Federal Government to come up with a coherent plan for dealing with the pandemic. Unfortunately the young and the feckless who refuse to common sense mitigation practices, such as masks, probably don’t travel to Europe."
2020-06-30 15:07,I understand the ban but I’m heartbroken. My 92 year old mom is at a nursing home in Denmark. I wonder when I’ll be able see her again.
2020-06-30 15:38,"Dual US-France citizens can practically travel to France, ethically and non ethically. The present position of the French government distinguishes between nationals and others. U.S. residents with French passports can enter in France, while being invited to “morally” commit to quarantine both upon arrival and return to place of residence. They are only required to sign an attestation of good health and indicate the motif of their trip (see document on gov site)."
2020-06-30 15:33,"I think the heavy lockdown has just deferred the inevitable. And now the US is trying to lock down again to defer the inevitable to Christmas. Rinse repeat and suddenly you've shut down your economy and schools and society for a year or more. How is this good for public health, and how is this good for public policy? People are going to die, so you can either drag it out or let it all happen in a short period of time (like here in Sweden) and then get on with mourning and rebuilding."
2020-06-30 15:31,"Since no Kings, Queens, Heada of a State or Dictators are likely to be visiting with Trump until the US gets its act together Trump’s rationale for refusing to wear a mask is now void."
2020-06-30 15:08,"Once again Trump’s America is shown to be *not* an exceptional leader, but a backwater 3rd world basket case with no national strategy. So many needless deaths, so many illnesses. 

Can anyone blame the EU for wanting to keep Americans out? Our economy will not recover until we get our viral plagued house in order. That means testing everyone with a 24 hour turnaround. That means infrastructures built for contact tracing that means national public service ads. That means Trump and leaders like our Arizona Governor Ducey wearing masks."
2020-06-30 15:23,"The United States has a GDP per capita that places it at number 13 amongst 189 countries and territories, yet it is off the EU list. Rwanda is number 166 and makes the EU list. The precipitous diminution in the US's standing around the world during a Trump administration that is incompetent during normal times, much less during a pandemic, is breathtaking. Let's hope our country's reputation is still salvageable."
2020-06-30 14:54,"The realities of this virus have been missed by both sides, the media, and the public:  COVID-19 is not going away!  We have to manage our expectations and use a pragmatic approach at prevention and maintaining our lives and economy.  On one side (like Texas), they threw caution (and masks) to the wind... on the other, they kept broad lock-downs in place, completely damaging the economy.  We thought China did such a great job, but now realize that because their expectations were unrealistic, they are now re-shutting down, too.  Europe is thinking about re-opening travel and shutting out the US... so what.  They will learn what China is learning:  That the toughest lock-downs are meaningless when travel is re-established.  When is the world going to wake-up and when will practicality prevail?  As medical advances come, we can change  our expectations further, but at the present time, we must use common sense, which is lacking worldwide.  Use protection, protect the elderly, social distance, but keep living!"
2020-06-30 15:34,"Pompeo says, “There’s enormous destruction of wealth.”. There we see what really matters to the Trump administration: money.

I would normally be visiting family in France this time of year, but I don’t blame the EU for following the science and excluding travelers from the US.
I fear the US won’t have an effective response to this pandemic until we are rid of Trump."
2020-06-30 15:57,The EU travel exceptions do not mention exemptions for athletes traveling to international events such as tennis tournaments.  Also many tennis players have a different residence than their citizenship.  Just curious.
2020-06-30 16:07,"Greece, Italy, Spain and Portugal especially need tourists.  This won't last long when the hotel and tourist businesses complain to their governments.  The article says they review the situation every two weeks. This will end in two weeks."
2020-06-30 16:17,"Would like to understand what was the criteria used to group Sweden, UK and Portugal as countries with serious outbreaks whereas Germany has localized outbreaks. Portugal is having localized outbreaks. Portugal is doing a higher number of testing/population than other EU countries and thus detecting more cases per habitant. It’s also reporting all the numbers. Does anyone really believe there are fewer infections occurring in Spain or Italy where the infection rates were the highest in the world just weeks ago? Comparing the ratio of number of infections/testing done would be more informative. Sweden didn’t have any control measures against covid-19 so we can’t really speak of outbreaks since it was never under control. In UK, some people reporting symptoms are not even being tested, and thus not included in the counts. There is a reason why numbers are used to report scientific information."
2020-06-30 15:54,"I haven't been to the US in over 3 1/2 years. I have been in Thailand since March 12, a country that has had very few cases. I hoped to soon travel to the EU. At this point I consider my US passport a curse."
2020-06-30 16:00,"I became a US Citizen in 2007. I’ve never felt more isolated as a human being living in the USA Today. Trump’s America is far from the country that I fell in love with, and chose to spend the rest of my life in.  I still love the USA, and most of people that live here.  I hate everything about Donald Trump and the people that lower themselves to support this man.  If Trump had been in power in 2007, I doubt that I would never have chosen to come here.  Hopefully we will not have to bear him much longer."
2020-06-30 15:52,"Americans need only ask: 
Is my life better than it was four years ago? 
Is my country in a better state than it was four years ago?

Answer honestly then vote accordingly."
2020-06-30 16:02,I didn't realize that making America great meant making our country the Great Death zone of 2020.  Not a surprising move by the EU as the US has completely mismanaged the pandemic response.
2020-06-30 16:07,"Another wall built, courtesy of trump and the GOP. And once again, we are paying for it."
2020-06-30 15:46,"Why is Vietnam not on the list? I’m a resident in Ho Chi Minh City with family in Germany. I live and work in Vietnam, a country of 95 million people, under 400 total cases, 21 active cases, and no community transmissions for nearly 70 days. We spent 3 months in a super strict but successful lockdown, with closed borders, contract tracing and comprehensive quarantine scheme."
2020-06-30 16:07,"We're becoming pariahs on the world stage, on our way to even lower depths if Trump is re-elected.  A failed state like Russia?  With lots of nuclear weapons?

We used to lead the way, even with our outsized military adventures.  

No more."
2020-06-30 16:02,"However, please take a moment to reflect on the fact that China is on the list of countries that are allowed in. Last time cinese visited Italy, 35.000 people died. And that was only 5 months ago. Aaand, they're back! This should tell us all a great lot about the priorities of 'our' european gouvernment (which we pay for btw). It's just beyond belief, really."
2020-06-30 15:59,Apparently the 'China Virus' is now the 'America Virus'. We've got a much bigger claim to it than China ever did at this point. I don't blame the EU for keeping their travel ban in place; it's just the only option.
2020-06-30 16:10,"This is warranted. It will sure do wonders to help the airlines recover. Trump and Trump-following governors like DeSantis here in FL have made America a pariah, and are forcing tens of millions of vulnerable seniors to stay home and remove themselves from the economy indefinitely, all so that thirty-somethings can party without masks. What a strategy."
2020-06-30 16:14,"Quite Amazing the arrogance of EU, US and others issuing unilateral edicts about travelers from countries for whom their borders will or will not be open. Guess what? — it takes a partner to agree to cross border travel. Thailand may be on the EU list, but none of the EU countries (or any other country for that matter) are yet on OUR list in Thailand. With some very few exceptions this country is still closed to foreigners. As almost no country has managed to control COVID-19 as well as the Thai government and people have achieved. The last thing which is needed here is foreign travelers bringing COVID-19 with them on holiday. No thanks."
2020-06-30 15:46,"The various countries in the developed world have reacted to COVID-19 with a wide divergence in effort and success. Taiwan, with a population of 23.8 million, has had only 440 confirmed COVID-19 cases and 7 deaths. Taiwan's Vice President Chen Chien-jen is an epidemiologist with a PhD from Johns Hopkins. Talk about having the right person in the right place at the right time. At the other extreme, there have been more than 2 million confirmed COVID-19 cases and 120,000 deaths in the USA, out of a population of 331 million. The other successful countries, also demonstrated that there was nothing inherent in SARS CoV-2, which meant that hundreds of thousands of deaths in the first world were inevitable.

The confluence of the rise in populism, with its disdain for intellectual elites and science in particular, combined with the rise of authoritarianism, turned what could have been only a nasty novel virus outbreak into a catastrophe. America was not the only advanced country that did not or could not take the steps necessary to contain the SARS CoV-2 Virus. Populist rulers of Brazil and the Philippines have channeled President Trump in first denying the seriousness of COVID-19 and then promoting unproven remedies. For example, President Bolsonaro of Brazil has insisted on expanding the use of chloroquine against COVID-19...""

2020-06-30 15:51,"Obviously a very reasonable decision given the Trump government’s bafflingly poor response. Still, it should be mentioned that many of the cases on the East Coast originated in Europe;

We probably should have shutdown all international travel in mid-February. Hopefully world leaders will learn from this and close borders sooner. This is going to happen again and China certainly will not be ending the practices that caused Covid-19 to enter the populace in the first place..."
2020-06-30 16:18,"There goes the European vacation for Americans this year. We are some of the best tourists. Prior to our trips we read up on the history and culture of the countries we plan to visit.  We patronize the museums in the heart of the cities in August when everything else is shut down. We tip generously. Germans sun themselves at the beaches. The French hardly leave a sou on the table. It will be Europe’s loss, not ours."
2020-06-30 16:23,"The southern countries that depend on tourism remind me of the mayor of Amity in “Jaws”, that wanted the beaches open for business even though the shark was eating people! Someone should tell them they can’t vote for Trump, the $ before human lives reality TV President."

2020-06-30 16:28,The odds of anyone booking a flight to Europe and contracting COVID-19 shortly before departure are so small to make the unintended consequences that might result from this decision not worth it.
2020-06-30 16:33,"It's great and fitting that the EU has bard American's from entering Europe, it just shows how far apart we have grown . . . which truly is fine.  Accordingly, the U.S. should bring all of the 63,000 U.S. troops home from Europe. You can fact check it, the U.S. taxpayer pays the great majority of the cost of those troops in Europe.  Certainly, the EU can defend it self and the U.S. taxpayer can no longer afford to pay for the EU's comfort.  The EU plays the U.S. on troops just as it does on trade where the EU has a massive trade surplus with the U.S.  It is time for the U.S. to get a spine and impose the same tariffs the EU imposes on us.     Put tariffs especially on the German cars.    Time to stop the EU from playing the U.S. tax payer."
2020-06-30 16:37,The problem with the formula the EU is using is they’re looking at the infection rate for the bloc as a whole and not the rate of the member country with the highest infection rate. Banning Americans while the Brits have free rein to travel will not make the continent any safer.

2020-06-30 16:34,"The US is ""reaping what has been sown"", driven by weak-willed behavior on the part of leadership as well as the general public.

The can't do without, instant gratification, false sense of ""freedom"", virus denying behavior displayed in the US promises for an unfeterred footpath for the virus.

What country, in its right mind, would welcome tourism from such an environment? Unless of course, the dollar there is stronger than concern for the health of its people."
2020-06-30 16:40,"""European Union officials went to great lengths to appear apolitical in their choices,"" Sort of -- The United States is paralyzed by politics, and everyone knows it.

Those of us who are not over- or under- reacting for the election in November are just emotional children not caring what happens to fellow Americans as long as we get to wear skimpy clothes and pack into bars and beaches.

Because every word of our politics is HATRED -- we hate our country, why should the EU think we respect them? 

Maybe those Americans who survive our self-infection ""because we feel like it"" will be allowed to visit Paris or London again, but maybe they won't trust us at all until we have grown up."
2020-06-30 16:56,"As a U.S. citizen with both family and friends in Germany, I am particularly dismayed by the E.U. decision to prevent travel to the continent -- especially while allowing other countries with known severe cases of COVID-19 (Brazil. Russia, China),  free access.
That said, there's little doubt that this president's brazen hostility toward NATO and strained relationship with European leaders has led up to not only this, but his ongoing threat to remove hundreds of thousands U.S. troops from German soil  is also involved -- a move that would only serve to benefit Russia, whose eye has never strayed far from the continent.
This is no paranoid delusion.
Having grown up in a Berlin and Germany divided and surrounded by the Wall, there was always the specter of a chance that one day this very thing would happen.
Say what you will, but history has a way of repeating itself.
And some things don't change."
2020-06-30 16:58,"""Travelers’ country of residence, not their nationality, will be the determining factor for their ability to travel to countries in the European Union""

This seems only partially true. According to the European Council:
""For countries where travel restrictions continue to apply, the following categories of people should be exempted from the restrictions:

- EU citizens and their family members
- long-term EU residents and their family members
- travellers with an essential function or need, as listed in the Recommendation.""

EU citizens look like they would be exempt from those restrictions?"

Provided Biden wins the election, this might happen sometime next spring."
2020-06-30 17:06,"I disagree with the decision to prevent Americans visiting  the EU. We are supposed to be allies, friends. Maybe a health certificate, quarantine or some other form of proof that those visiting are in good health etc. I do not like President Trump but he and his opinions do not represent all US citizens. Hoping that this rule will be over turned shortly."
2020-06-30 17:22,"That's fine. US spends an insane amount of money on Europe tourism. 2 of my coworkers are already extracting five figure sums in returns from Italy.

The US is a mega diverse ecosystem with mountains, deserts, beaches, etc. 

Maybe more Americans can explore and appreciate the beauty at home before going to Europe. More are, it seems, as I went to buy a canoe and new fishing rod... and there are none.

It'll also help tourism at home, even though national parks in Utah fill up in 30 minutes now. And that is how it is out here everywhere."

The thing I don’t get is how relaxed we are now with the rest of Eu and among the same country where there are such high numbers of infected people who now are moving and travelling all over our countries, and many without masks, as if truly the virus is gone who knows where! Seriously??  Unfortunately I don’t see any good thing coming in this coming future. We’re going to have back many cases hoping they don’t collapse hospitals again."

2020-06-30 19:02,"I love going to Europe; however, it is very wise to ban tourists from the US. We are currently as high with infections as any third world country and besides the chaos we live with we have no central leadership on Covid.

I would not mind passing through Amsterdam and strolling through the city, stopping by at the Van Gough museum and sampling some Indonesian food. Now Europe will be flyover  country just like most people flying from the east coast to the West. Not the tourism is big in Germany but with its economy in its worse shape, throng of American tourists not visiting in summer will be a big blow. Italy and Spain which gets a ton of US visitors in the summer will be seeing the worst job losses. 

One the of biggest forced errors of the Trump administration was not to stop air traffic from China by two month and not to stop air travel from Europe a month earlier than it did. I guess the Trump administration was not informed in a timely manner by the WHO that the Coronavirus spread had already occurred out of Wuhan, China and that had spread to Italy and the rest of Europe. In fact for a long time Africa was the only continent where COVID-19 had  not made a landfall until its first case identified in Nigeria from an Italian visitor. No wonder Trump is fuming over the WHO's pitiful management of the awful spread of this pandemic when this could have been nipped in the bud before the dawn of 2020. 

The need for a vaccine is increasingly URGENT. The global effort to get one is very encouraging.

2020-06-30 21:03,"This has created quite a stir in the expat community in the US. Can the NYT verify/clarify, or correct if not, whether EU citizens that are residents in the US will be excluded from travel?"
2020-06-30 22:12,"It is hard to understand the European action as one directed at the US.  The EU has not banned travel from the US.  Europe has simply decided to open its borders to residents of countries which have achieved very low rates of covid transmission, as the Europeans themselves have, after a calamitous beginning.  The list will be revised every two weeks with countries being added to the ""can travel"" list, or removed from it, according to their current transmission and infection rates.  
Individuals with fevers and coughs are asked to self-isolate today in most jurisdictions.  Europe has simply applied a version of this test to nations.  America has a cough and a fever and should heal itself before going out."
2020-06-30 22:51,"I think few people understand or remember just how much effort went into building brand America, once upon a time, during the years following WW2. The best and brightest — from a pool limited by race, gender, and class — dedicated themselves to convincing the citizens of other countries that we were not ignorant bumpkins without culture, that we had great music and dance to share, for example: think Dave Brubeck and Louis Armstrong, Martha Graham and Dizzie Gillespie on government funded tours of the world, and broadcast on VOA to millions more. Similar work was done in so many fields, from art and design to agriculture and science, much of it motivated by post-war optimism and a commitment to a world without war, to building “a family of man.”

With Trump, all that is trashed and won’t be back. This travel ban is just one symptom; there will be many."
2020-06-30 21:54,Trump has done a fantastic job. The fastest way to get immune is to reach 100.000 daily infections. As Fauci predicted.
2020-06-30 23:34,"As a Serb I am happy that travel from Serbia to EU is now allowed. I have friends who would like to join their family members. But I can’t help but question the prudence of that decision. Serbia right now has an uncontrolled community spread, after having its economy completely open for more than a month and a half. It is getting worse by day and there are reports of dozens of people dying in hospital hallways, on the floor. Doctors are speaking out from across the country about people dying and a collapsing health system. For example, they say there are not enough tests and only a few of those with the worst symptoms might get tested. The government has been systematically obstructing COVID diagnosis, testing and simply lying about the numbers. I personally know many people whose tests results got “lost”. Now, people are dying, the spread is out of control and even (so far) several of the highest ranking country officials are hospitalized with COVID while the president has been mysteriously missing from the media in the last few days.

So, I’m asking, if Serbia with a completely uncontrolled spread (concerts, soccer matches happening daily with huge audiences of thousands of people) is on the EU “safe” list, why isn’t the USA?"
2020-07-01 1:56,Is this the first time the United States has ever been barred from travelling to another nation because of health issues?
2020-07-01 2:24,Don’t forget you banned the EU first. Like Russia and Brazil you have had an inefficient government reply to this terrifying virus.I hope we are not making a mistake opening up our borders again to other nations.
2020-07-01 3:36,"Frankly, given the current state of containment of the virus here, I wouldn't want us, either.

I would like nothing more than to travel to Europe (and, in fact, had a trip planned for this month and July for the UK and France). But even if the EU was to let in Americans, the thought of squeezing into a transatlantic flight for 12 hours or so in both directions would deter me from making such a trip.

Here's hoping things are substantially changed in 2021 when we have an administration that believes in, and respects, science."
2020-07-01 4:01,"NYT contributes to the overall confusion and lack of clarity by saying this in the article: 
""Travelers’ country of residence, not their nationality, will be the determining factor for their ability to travel to countries in the European Union, officials said.""
However, the link posted in the article to the European Commission page detailing the travel conditions states this:
""For countries where travel restrictions continue to apply, the following categories of people should be exempted from the restrictions:
- EU citizens and their family members
- long-term EU residents and their family members
- travellers with an essential function or need, as listed in the 
  Recommendation.""

Which is it now? Clearly no one understands how this works. The EU, just like the US, does not ban its own citizens from entry, but can impose quarantine measures to protect public health."

Maybe can rise about 200.000 in the end of July, 300.000 in the end of August?
How many death you need for take a goods rules? 
I'm very worried about the all happening at U. S.
I wish you can fix it instantly, but I'm afraid you must change all things."
2020-07-01 6:03,The political aspect of the decision is only in the imagination of the NYTimes. The decision is clearly with a view to public health and not because we hold a grudge over Trump for blocking travel first.
2020-07-01 10:08,"There is no other option but the bloc the US, the clear disregard of lockdown shown by so many US citizens has created an unprecidented number of cases, even supposed 'law enforcers' are telling citizens to ignore the face mask rule in some states. It is so sad that people have so little regard for human life, from what we have seen so far it will lead to the US having the longest recovery both health wise and economically, it is hard to allow the US to flow freely when the member states cannot agree on what best to do to save human lives. It is so sad that people are so selfish as to allow the spread and death becasue tey personally think having to wear a mask contravenes their US humans rights and it will reflect in a much longer recovery. 

Personally we have already cancelled our $30k family holiday for 12 people to Disney for October 2021 and we will probably never visit the USA again after what we have seen happening there. I think that state wise citizens don't look at what the overall US picture looks like to those outside the US they concentrate on their own state and their own beliefs and don't see the absolutly diabolic shambles that is shown as a nation, this is why they have been grouped in with the likes of Brazil and banned from travel. 

You cannot refuse to follow the rues and then expect to be allowed to freely travel, if you break the rules you need to stay put and let the consequences of that and the deaths affect your own community and not everyone else."
2020-07-01 11:57,"No amount of ""wealth decimation"",  per U.S. Secretary of State Pompeo, is worth life decimation. 

U.S. policies under the Trump administration, and supported by elected Republicans, place little value on human life.  

They support businesses which insist that their poorest-paid, who work in the least sanitary conditions, ""get back to work, or be fired!""  If they are fired, they cannot get unemployment insurance. 

Instead of furloughing workers,  as in the EU,  where the government pays 80% of worker salaries, Americans fire workers, leaving them penniless. 

Also, Americans' choose to fight for the right to infect and be infected (not only Republicans) over the responsibility to keep fellow-Americans safe.  This has rapidly spread Covid-19.  Throngs of maskless beach, bar, restaurant, and church-goers spread the virus. 

With U.S. leadership and citizens this irresponsible and infected, it is inconceivable that they be welcome in the EU."
2020-07-01 12:11,"But, Britain? 

I completely understand keeping Americans out. 

I live in a small, crowded, gentrified, city across the Hudson from Manhattan. The vast majority do not wear masks or socially distance. To all appearances they are not concerned about anyone but themselves. 

So, yes, keep us out, but, the British? I’ve seen many reports on the bad behavior of British tourists in Southern Europe. How much better will they behave after having been restricted in their home country for months? 

I fear this will not go well."
2020-07-01 11:59,And the EU would even consider allowing Chinese into Europe?  They are being duped with all of the manufactured statistics and lies coming from the government of that country. Great way for the Chinese to start another wave.
2020-07-01 13:58,"The exceptionalist feelings of Anglo-Saxon culture is very visible the last years and were amplified during this health pandemic.
Banning travellers from entering the US - applause. Being banned from traveling to Europe - ""They need our money, we won the war, we are the masters, they need us more than we need them, tourism will break down in Europe, we will put tariffs yadda yadda yadda..."".
Exactly the same with Brexit. ""No EU immigrants please, but we British want to go and retire everywhere because we are British"".

This prevents any facts based and sensible view on the best precautions and decisions to slow down the pandemic and to save the most of lives.
And the facts do not speak for the US. Ignoring the risks, ignoring the virus, even stating that the old and weak dying would be good as this made the society stronger with less burden to the economy is not what is considered a viable approach in pretty much whole Europe. The numbers tell it and the decision to not take the risk to let travellers from the US enter is a rational one - and not political."
2020-07-01 13:54,"We can thank Trump for this. Not only has he failed to respond to the virus, he has also bad mouthed and acted very  bad to our EU allies for the last four years. Fortunately the people in those countries know that most of the American people can't stand Trump.
Donald whines the allies are always taking advantage of us. With no contact now, I wonder if he will still claim that."

It was completely unlike the normal colds we get (fever, dry cough, sound familiar?), and my friends that work in offices said that everyone in the office got it.  Looking back, we figured it couldn't be COVID-19 because nobody really got sick enough to need medical attention.  If COVID-19 was widely circulating, there would have to be more deaths, right?

When antibody tests became available, I got tested.  I was negative.  So either the test is wrong, or I had something else.  Weird timing.  Weird cold.  Weird times we live in!"
2020-07-01 15:42,Some weird upper respiratory virus was circulating here in November and onwards.  I don't think it was covid because of the copious amount of phlegm and mucous that was involved with the croupy cough but there was definitely something weird happening and my physician friends said there was a really big spike in people presenting in their offices with this.

2020-07-01 21:32,"NO NO NO!  

I had Coronavirus in January.  I became ill five days after my father passed away, and had the exact symptoms described.  Two of my nephews became ill as well.  They both went to different doctors, and were told they did not have the flu.  I tested positive for antibodies at the end of May with the Rosche Antibody test.  

My dad was an 85 year old heavy smoker, who needed a walker to get around.  He was in a rehab facility in Bergen County (a hot spot), and had gone back and forth to Englewood Hospital.  Looking back, I am 99% sure that he had Coronavirus.  I had not seen my nephews in more than a month, because we visited my dad at different times.

While there were other possible sources, it is likely my dad had it.  He had a DNR, so little was done to prolong his life. 
Initially I thought I got it from some new international students at my dance studio.  My nephews were both in Italy before the New Year, but that was three weeks earlier.   Whatever the source, one thing is clear...The Coronavirus was most certainly in New York in January.  

Also, I was exposed to the virus in mid-March, spending six hours (two nights in a row for three hours) with a student in his home (who thought he had a cold, until his mom tested positive days later).  We shared pencils and paper, sitting at a small table, and despite his sneezes, I did not get sick again.

I have emailed the CDC, but they did not even acknowledge my correspondence.  The question is...""Why not?"""
2020-07-01 16:02,"Why is it assumed that everyone who is exposed to the virus will get it? That's not how viruses work. Some people get sick; others get infected but their antibodies kick in; and a whole lot of people never react one way or the other. This is why we aren't all walking around with colds from November through March, and why not everyone exposed to, say, HIV, developed AIDS or the antigens that show infection.

The fact is, we have no idea what the infection rate is across a population for CoV2."

We arrived December 3, 2019 on American Airlines. The first week of December he was being tested and evaluated - as a liver transplant recipient there were many protocols to meet. We managed to go out and enjoy Memphis - Beale street we shopped and dined out. The surgery was successful according to the doctors but my husband was having trouble breathing and lingered on the oxygen tube until they insisted that he “get up and start walking and breathing” on his own. We left Memphis on December 17th and he barely made it back to NY.  January 2, 2020 I took him to the emergency room at Northwell in Manhasset where he stayed for almost a month while they did every test possible only to conclude that they didn’t know what he had but his lungs were filled with an opaque ground glass fibrosis. He didn’t have a virus we were told and there was no cure or treatment other than steroids.  His oxygen saturation got worse and worse until he died on February 10, 2020.  I know he had Covid - he must have caught it when we went to Memphis.  He was 66 when he died."

To offer a remedy, I have written two books, Handbook for Piano Practice, and Piano Practice for the Advancing Student, both published by William R Parks and available on Amazon."
2020-07-02 15:09,"This is such cheering news, and good news for all the people who are acquiring instruments. The piano is a place of solace. And of delight and sometimes frustration, yes, as your hands bring forth sound from the instrument. Even if what you hear doesn’t match what you hear on recordings, there is something about producing the sound yourself that is magical.￼￼ And zoom or FaceTime lessons really do work."

I asked the dealer if there were a lot of good pianists in the area and who was buying the $100,000+ grand pianos. The dealer said most of them will barely ever get played and end up as showpieces at wealthy people's large homes. I love playing Chopin Nocturnes and Preludes, and have naturally taken on new challenging pieces during the lock down. I upgraded my $300 Alesis keyboard to a $650 Yamaha P125 with weighted keys. It's amazing. Hopefully those wealthy folks with their grand pianos have taken some time to sit down and learn some tunes!"
2020-07-02 16:44,"A piano is a luxury. But if you can afford it and have the space, add a piano to your home. Whether used or new, upright or grand, digital or acoustic, this is one of those binary things in life: you either have a piano or you don't -- and if you do, then you will always have the option of making music.
 

Even as the commitment to playing and practicing ebbs from time to time, a piano endures. From young to old, anyone can touch a key and produce sound.
 

If you buy a digital piano, at minimum be sure it has weighted keys, as an important part of the experience is that greater pressure applied to a key results in a louder sound. I first touched a piano when I was 3 years old, and my parents recall that in that initial experience I simply learned the difference that resulted from delicately pressing one key versus full palm slapping on several -- nothing more than simple cause and effect, basic exploration, and they let me discover. Over 40 years later, being able to play piano is one of the things I most cherish in life, and it all started by having one at home."
2020-07-02 16:50,"I bought a Yamaha AvantGrand digital piano last summer, and it has been an absolute lifesaver during the pandemic.  There is simply no way to think about the world's problems while playing piano.  I come home from the hospital and head straight for the music room.  It is truly a lifetime adventure to master all of the possibilities, especially now with all of the great instruction available online.

I play every day, and it is worth every penny."

It would be great if whatever Dr. Fauci and others recommend is wholeheartedly embraced by Congressional leaders and appropriate actions taken quickly.  While the Executive Branch seems tied in knots, maybe Congress can act expeditiously.

Also, I have to wonder, if the PPE was so successful why are so many people filing for unemployment?"
2020-06-30 11:34,"This wave across the country was predicted, yet the press acts like it’s a surprise. On top of that, we are doing NOTHING extra to protect the most vulnerable (according to the AMA over 94 percent of Covid 19 hospitalizations are elderly or those with T1 diabetes and/or severe heart disease) beyond what we ask the least vulnerable to do. This is immoral."
2020-06-30 11:49,There are no jobs  out there for the unemployed except those paying less than $15/hr. That translate to an annual income of $28000 per year. Many of these jobs have no benefits. The number of unemployed and the lack of jobs for them is much more of a crisis than Covid 19. Yet is congress addressing this problem? Mitch is not going to let a solution happen. It's almost as if the Republicans are wishing this catastrophe upon us.
2020-06-30 10:39,"Three steps to containing and ending this, short of a vaccine:
1.  Testing - a big investment needed, across the country
2.  Contact tracing - another huge investment required (jobs!)
3.  Appropriate behavior following contact reporting - isolation or other personal decisions to restrain oneself.

Each of these presents a big challenge.  #3 is probably the hardest in the current climate of cultural conflict where a large part of the population appears to believe that compliance with corona virus  mitigation reflects some kind of moral weakness.  Leadership, at the national level WOULD make a difference.   Just not at all likely at the moment."

The US has chosen the absolute worst path possible: locking down without compensation (economic anarchy) in some states and then opening without health care and testing in others. 

You can’t even grade the US government strategy because an F is 100 miles above the job they’re doing. It’s an absolute disgrace."

We are, as a country, six months into a catastrophe that might not have shone a glaring headlight coming down the tracks at us but was enough for the medical and scientific experts in the C.D.C. to send out high alerts to Washington as to what was coming. 

Dr. Nancy Messonier delivered the bad news to Donald Trump who was about to return to Washington from New Delhi. “It’s not a question of if this will happen but when this will happen and how many people in this country will have severe illnesses,” Dr. Messonier told the Wall Street Journal on February 25th. 

The same day, Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar said the virus was “contained” in the U.S. 

This is the kind of ""After you, Alphonse"" black comedy that has clearly defined this presidential administration's woefully inadequate response. Hundreds of thousands of Americans are now dead--with more certain to come. The president's allies in the South and Southwest are doing a rare two-step to save face, not lives.

And Ms. McEnany continues to trot out the lethal lie that ""we're working on it."" She didn't blame President Obama for it.

I hope my state pays heed here--we are still in a long-drawn-out reopening, but if Baker isn't careful, we could follow CA.

The second is that alarming news of a new swine flu potentially brewing among Chinese hogs.  Were that to catapult onto the scene, I can't imagine how nations could fight both.

In spite of two recent outbreaks locally (both in meat factories), Germany had a total number of only 262 new cases yesterday , including 146 in the state of one of those factories. Two days ago a fully covered emergency doctor came to our neighbors just to take a Corona test on their daughter who had fever - to make sure that she would not possibly risk taking an infection into the kindergarten."

Lying about the disease disappearing, ""It's like the flu,"" is not science.

Dr. Fauci, take a deep breath and smell the morgue. There is nothing rosy about any of this. He has ruined the economy. He has ruined civil rights. He has ruined international relationships all over the planet. He has killed children in cages (where was the National Institutes of Health on that one). He has encouraged racism and white power.

And he has marginalized you.

What more do you need to recognize wreckage. Testimony has no gravitas. You stand behind him. We cannot believe anything you say. The symbolism you exemplified is gone.

Resign. Resist.

You are now a card carrying member of an army of lying, malevolent enablers who will do anything, say anything to enable Trump.

You would still have a media stage. We would listen."

Can we please simplify this, immediately, to the very first basic steps: WEAR MASKS and SOCIAL DISTANCE.

My three most conservative male friends, he-men all of them, are wearing masks everywhere they go - just like the honorable Dr Fauci and fellow administration officials in this striking picture.

Trump refusing to wear a mask in public is tantamount to murder - not only for the people around him, for hundreds of thousands of people in our country who will get infected and die without mask protection. And, perhaps more importantly for so-called fiscal conservatives - Trump is singlehandedly destroying our economy because his maskless sycophants infect everybody around them, shutting down their local businesses with reckless abandon, exploding our federal deficit with the direct and tangential quagmire of mass unemployment.

Trump is hurting us  - he's quite literally killing us - everywhere it counts.

One of the biggest steps a person can do on a personal level to combat climate change. 
We are all just sheeple who blindly follow and lately we have been starting to wake up. But why are simple things so hard for Americans? Why can we not wear our masks? Why was it so important to reopen so that the sheeple can rush to Applebee’s to get their appetizer sampler platters? 
Why do we not value health like other countries? Why are so many Americans, AND AMERICAN CHILDREN obese and suffering from health issues? Why is our food poison and our water poison and our air poison?

Or maybe he is on the phone with Putin right now, getting reassurances that the reports related to Russia funding the Taliban to kill American Soldiers isn't true.  How strange would it be if the next time we hear from bone-spur-deferment-Don, he will be wearing a mask and telling us that he believes Putin when he says Russia did no such thing?

We also know some are directly from youngsters socializing without masks or distancing (Jacksonville, FL woman going to bar w/ nurse friends who contracted it after being sheltering at home; the Westchester high school student who travelled to/from FL; spring breakers in Atlanta and Texas).

I don't see compliance with distancing and wearing masks in the majority of cases on the street. People cycling (I am a cyclist) seem to be totally disinterested in wearing masks, as are many people who walk and jog.

It is a shock that the brunt of global COVID devastation should be hitting the US the hardest of all countries, by far. This suggests that the standard measures of social capital would put America into third-world class notwithstanding the country's enormous total wealth which is overwhelmingly concentrated at the tip of its economic pyramid.

Strip away the top five percent of its national wealth and on a per-capita basis America ranks right down there with Chad or Venezuela in its distribution of economic bounty. This reality will not abate until America's political power structure is upended and replaced by governance more just. 

Even then the damage will take years or decades to repair."

- of those hospitalized, 99%+ are either over 75 or have an underlying illness (obesity with resulting diabetes and heart disease is #1).
- for those under 65 with no underlying medical condition, the risk of this disease is minimal.

The clear message: if you are over 75 and/or have an underlying illness, take appropriate precautions. if you live with or are exposed to someone over 75 and/or has an underlying illness, take appropriate precautions. And...if you are under 65 with no underlying illness, be respectful, wear a mask when around others, but carry on."

Let's have an honest conversation with Americans about masks. A message for young people.  Another for those more at risk.  No more browbeating, humiliating or threats.  That's counterproductive.

Yet I will say that there remain business enterprises which defied guidelines on how to prevent the spread of Covid-19.  And let us couple that with enough of our state's people who laughed at the idea of wearing a mask and social distancing.  The rejection by even a minority of the three W's - Wear a mask, Wash your hands, and Walk at a safe-distance - is enough to hurt us all, from Southern to Northern CA.

I'd expect two results: 1. Compliance with guidelines (if enforcement was employed, even selectively) would increase dramatically. 2.

However, for those who have secretly wished something similar on our “mask-less,” science-rejecting President in hopes of some sort of Damascene conversion to a sane, coordinated, and compassionate response to this health crisis, I think he would only  consider it a case of “lèse majesté” and he and his followers (particularly the Evangelicals) would treat his survival as further proof that he is  “the chosen one,” sent to “Keep America Great.”

Think about that while you’re listening to Dr. Fauci and others discuss the Trump administration’s catastrophic bungling of this pandemic.

Vote November 3rd as if your life depends on it, because it literally does."
2020-06-30 15:17,"Perhaps the greatest public health official during the the HIV pandemic, Dr. Fauci is now ignored and demonized by the Trump administration and his followers. I hope Biden wins by a wide margin in November. It's hard to imagine the bad shape this country will be in by then."

2020-06-30 14:43,"By the time the election rolls around, there will have been over 250,000 deaths that we can attribute to a Trumps “leadership”... and personal and business bankruptcies will be trickling in long after he’s gone."
2020-06-30 14:57,"We need to start seeing criminal penalties for people who host superspreader events. While my family lives in lockdown, a few criminally selfish are driving our health care system, our educational system, and our entire economy to the brink of disaster. That's in addition to the thousands they are killing. Jail time, please!"
2020-06-30 14:22,"It is not the virus which is defeating us but our own dangerous,  and selfish behavior that is doing so.  Let's stop these silly headlines and stories about how the virus is winning.  The virus is a particle that isn't even alive.  It's not capable of ""winning"" but we are capable of knowingly exposing ourselves to its potentially deadly effects."
2020-06-30 14:36,"What goes around comes around. Trump, who proudly proclaimed  barring Chinese from entering the country, is now witness to the country he has ""made great again"" barred from Europe. Of course he will spin this with sour grapes (Who needs to go there anyway?) but this decision by the EU comes as a result of Trump's incompetence and mendacity in addressing the pandemic."
2020-06-30 15:07,"I have doctors and epidemiologists in my family. I believe in science and vaccines.

That said I do not fully trust the Trump administration nor the health agencies now headed by Trump appointees to THOROUGHLY vet a Covid vaccine for public safety.  I worry that political pressure continues to be exerted on scientists, clinicians and drug manufacturers to rush Covid vaccines to market to “save”  Trump’s and Republican re-elections. My trust that public welfare drives policy in national decision making has been seriously eroded and will have to be rebuilt. I suspect I’m not alone. 

Accelerated safety trials leave room for doubt that a vaccine is truly safe, especially due to the constant lies and discounting of solid science by Trump’s administration. I find myself wondering if Dr Fauci has to “temper” his testimony and thoughts in order to remain in the public view and exert some measure of coherent influence over policy. I wish he could say what he really thinks ....

The co-mingling of science and “win at any cost” politics has done enormous damage to public trust in science. The results are disastrous, not only regarding Covid but also for the environment. 

Science has been usurped and corrupted by politics, especially re Covid vaccines; it’s not just anti-vaxxers who doubt and may refuse to be vaccinated. Trump and his sycophants have contaminated the well of scientific integrity."
2020-06-30 15:30,"Cases in a vacuum aren't meaningful. Hospital admissions due to Covid (not something else and Covid is an incidental finding), ICU admissions, vent usage and deaths are. Only 15% of hospitalizations in Arizona are due to coronavirus. The rest are due to a backlog of elective surgeries and people sicker from delaying routine medical care. In Florida it's similar, with the bulk of deaths in people over 80. Everyone's screaming that it's terrible that people under 30 are testing positive. It's what we said we wanted back in March and April. And hospitals need to be at near capacity or they will go bankrupt. Protesting and looting didn't result in increased cases, let alone sick and dead. Obviously, the virus needs to run through a community and kill and sicken those it will kill and sicken and then it becomes like any other illness, including the flu. Finally, Trump's destroying himself. Continued lockdowns based on half truths and hysteria will only drive sane people who can think and read to vote for him because virus hysteria is worse than Trump's incompetence."

They have a big sign on the front door: PLEASE WEAR YOUR MASK. However, once inside only 2 out of 7 people had a mask on (including myself); 2 out of 4 nurses and most (clerical) staff had no mask on. The governor does not require this, even though New Orleans was an early hot spot. Why? There is no excuse."
2020-06-30 14:36,"Compare to Wuhan lockdown, the slowing and tedious open-and-close scenario is really ugly and unbearable. A very patient (old) person like me feels impatient.

Why can't the government be more decisive.  A very transmissible disease is a national security risk.  Under that, liberty and democracy have to be tailored to fit the situation. Why can't the government order people to wear mask and keep social distancing.  It is not only irresponsible but also affect other people in the surrounding.

I wonder how come people are so rigid and close minded.  Why can't people be more flexible and tolerant to the doctrine we are deeply ingrained.  ""I cannot breathe"" is just one of those outbursts to the ironclad impaired mind."
2020-06-30 14:53,"Imagine a bona-fide GOP Senator asked Trump to do something.  Lordy, Lordy, ""be still my heart"".  Maybe it is too late for Trump to show gumption or wear a mask. The bottom of the GOP bucket is leaking support like Niagara Falls.  Imagine DC photojournalist teeing off on Trump after all these years of scowling and wincing under his layers of makeup.  A mask will certainly conflict with his makeup."

2020-06-30 14:28,"Why is the Director of the CDC holding a mask to his face instead of wearing it in the photo embedded in this article?  The coronavirus is untamed in many states and probably at large everywhere and we all need to do our bit to change that situation - especially those engaged in protecting or attempting to protect public health in the United States. 
Wear your mask Dr. Redfield."
2020-06-30 14:23,"A NYT article points out that some asymptomatic carriers are super-spreaders, while others may not infect anyone at all.  Then there is the conundrum that a few get very sick, but larger numbers may have symptoms that are modest, a-typical, or nil.

The paradoxes owe not to some baffling subtleties of the virus itself, but to differences in people's physiology, nutrition, age, or other health conditions.  Research into these risk factors may tell us most about how to control or mitigate the scope or gravity of infection.

Meanwhile, research about the virus itself, or the search for a vaccine, may cost a lot, and yield little, if the significance is  utterly blurred by the variables that distinguish the people exposed.

Unfortunately, a lot of the mass testing data has none of the supporting information about the people's health profiles, other than age, gender, and ethnicity.  We don't know the incidence of contacts with people who got sick or remained without symptoms.

It might take 1,000 or so volunteers for a six-month study to get a handle on this.  Or the government could, for a modest supplement to unemployment or other COVID-19 relief payments, get 100,000 or more people to participate in such a survey.  Of course, the sample might not escape some bias: too few deniers or Fox viewers.  Or might we get everyone on a ""let's solve this"" bandwagon?"
2020-06-30 14:43,"Remove the conflict of interest: people want to work and get their businesses open. We should compensate people who are without an income, otherwise we're just lurching about.

2020-06-30 15:10,"The world may have changed but containment strategies have not. The ‘Spanish Flu’ of 1918 lasted 2 years in 3 waves with 500 million people infected and 50 million deaths. Most of the fatalities happened in the 2nd wave. People felt put upon by the quarantine and social distancing measures imposed at the outset and when they were lifted, there was rejoicing in the streets. A few weeks later however the 2nd wave hit with a vengeance killing tens of millions."
2020-06-30 14:52,"I'd like to ask Dr. Fauci: ""What is the current threat of mortality from this virus?""  I don't understand why the cases are spiking but deaths keep falling. Even in Los Angeles, which now has 1/3 the number of total cases that New York has, the total deaths are less than 1/10th of NY.  Is the virus less deadly? I appreciate the Times's data, but there has not been much interpretation of the two differing curves that we see."

2020-06-30 16:11,"Listening to the Senate hearing right now I am convinced that by the year 2030, the U.S. can put together a Covid tracing and testing plan almost as good as most of the rest of the the First World countries have today. It may take a few hundred billion dollars directed to the big pharma and other corporate friends of Republicans, but by George, I think we can do it."
2020-06-30 13:24,"Enough of the recommendations to wear masks, the primary obstacle to spread of this deadly virus. Make it mandatory nationwide and vigorously enforce mandatory wearing of masks in public until a vaccine is developed. Funny that we have laws prohibiting public nudity, something that harms no one, but not one the mandates masks, something that harms everyone. Are we nuts?"
2020-06-30 13:13,"We are shortly entering the fifth month of this crisis and the United States of America, the richest country in the world, to date has  issued ONE $1,200 stimulus check which many have yet to receive.  It challenges credulity how poorly mismanaged in every aspect the federal response to everything related to the COVID-19 pandemic continues to be. So long as this administration is in power, Americans will continue to suffer and die. 

2,600,000+ confirmed cases. 126,000+ deaths.  The worst statistics on the planet."
2020-06-30 14:26,"Why it’s optional to not wear a mask is beyond me. It is not my option to not buckle up. It is not my option to speed. Likewise, it is not my option to walk around without a mask in the company of others during a deadly pandemic. Period."
2020-06-30 16:13,"It's absolutely disheartening in these hearings to hear GOP Senator after GOP Senator think that the 125,000+ deaths we have experienced so far is a ""success"" because it isn't the original 1 to 2 million deaths predicted in the first models.  It is insulting to those who have lost loved ones, those who will continue to die in the months ahead."
2020-06-30 16:07,"I don’t know what anyone expected. The virus never went away or got less contagious. We need a hard shut down across the country. Freeze rent and mortgage payments, mandate all Americans stay inside for one month (or however long) with no bending of the rules (set everyone up with necessary food reserves and a bit of cash to weather this), require businesses to freeze operations, and let this thing burn out once and for all. We are never going to beat it if we try to live with it. It’ll be cheaper in the long run (and less traumatic economically, physically, and emotionally) if we just do a hard shut down. Every state comply with the same rules."
2020-06-30 15:51,"It is very apparent that there are too many people in this country who believe a vaccine is on the way and, until then, they are willing to play the odds and not get sick. Concurrently we have a president who believes the miracle cure is right around the corner and wants it delivered before Election Day. 

His words and actions re-enforce the attitudes and actions of the aforementioned group. Until he changes, they won't change. In essence, every day he plays Russian Roulette  with our lives.

Sorry Senator. I know you are a good person. You mean well, I do not in any way question the sincerity of your words.

But this so-called ""President"" wants nothing but this ""political debate about pro-Trump, anti-Trump to continue."" He thrives on it. He deliberately foregoes wearing a mask for the very purpose of stoking up his ""many admirers."" And he's not going to stop.

If you refuse a FDA-approved COVID vaccine, absent a valid medical reason, and you should not be allowed to enroll your kids in a Public School. A Trumpist anti-vaccine conspiracy may be your fantasy, but it's just that--a fantasy.

I’m sure it is a problem in places but I will not be locking my door and hiding under my bed. I do wear a mask as do most here and go out as little as possible."

Worst POTUS ever, and it’s not even close."
2020-06-30 16:18,"We need to have a unified, national response. This state by state, even county by county, disjointed response has produced a disjointed, helter skelter response.

It's a Presidential cliche but ""the buck stops here"" still holds true. President Trump, lead or get out the way."
2020-06-30 16:18,The real problem in the beginning of the pandemic and more so now is Trump. He doesn't have the capability to rise above politics and admit that we have a serious problem with the spread of Covid-19. He cannot bear to tell his followers to wear a mast or even occasionally wear one himself. Trump has failed this country too many times to name and is continuing to do so. More Republican Governors and Senators need to come out and say this. From the heath of our citizens to the protection of our military in combat he has failed us all.

It seems that the AAP has institutionalized an assigned burden on teachers that came about as a result of the elimination of mental and social health services in the community.  It's no wonder teachers suffer from burn-out.

Lest we forget, the same can be said for our local constabulary as well."

Fauci has all the models/all the numbers and is pretending it's too tough a question to answer.  He's throwing up his usual, ""The models are as good as assumptions.""  Yes, that's true. 
 Dr. Fauci, now answer the question.  I'm afraid Fauci has lost his credibility. Only so many times you can stand on a stage with Mike Pence. He's hurt himself badly."

A simple example: college educations and college sports.  From the parents' and students' perspective, investments have been made and they will/must be recouped.  An on-campus, in-person experience is only partly about the education.  Future friends, business connections, and future marriages are formed on college campus. These social network effects are invaluable for future jobs, etc.  Families and students groom/prep for years to get into certain colleges.  College athletes train for years to get to compete at the collegiate level.    Foregoing any of this requires a sacrifice that I guarantee will not be made.  A whole information industry will crop up to help people learn how to dodge tests, avoid contact tracers, and evade quarantine.  What do you think will happen if the day before leaving for a key high school national tournament where critical college coach observations will happen and an asymptomatic healthy parent sees a caller ID of the state contact tracing agency appears?  Picking it up could potentially derail the entire team's appearance at it.  The examples go on and on.

What we need to comprehend about Trump is that first, he is visual so vanity overtakes logic, second, he is someone who has more than once gone thru the propaganda that autism is caused by vaccines, he shares this view with many, it is not helped that certain television personalities on Fox News as well as other influential people such as Newt Gingrich and his wife promote this without it being scientifically based.  Until Trump decides to be mature about facial masks then his multitude of followers will continue to deny the pandemic exists in its present strength and will continue to dismiss what physicians are advising. There is no doubt that should we continue at this pace, not only will the health and welfare of Americans and international citizens be jeopardized but so will the economy that affects the every day person, as for the stock market it will continue to be volatile, however, the wealthy will survive."

An early cohesive plan for the whole country, taking into account hot spots and demographics, testing, contact tracing would have cut infections and death to a fraction of their present numbers. However, since there was only purposeful division by the great divider instead of the ""we've all got to work on this together like in WW I and II, the problem now is the huge numbers of the population who will never follow any rules and caveats to snub their noses at the vulnerable and the ""opposition."""

My fear is of an insufficiently and improperly tested vaccine being released. And in ""races"" such as this there will undoubtedly be slip-ups, with who knows what kind of consequences, as companies try to win the jackpot. As we have seen so far, too many unsubstantiated claims and dreams are being touted as the potential vaccine, only to find upon further investigation, that the claims hold no data or statistical water, although they do drive up stock prices for a time. And on a side note, if physicians want compliance, they should push for the use of microneedle patches instead of injections. I will bet that compliance with all vaccines will increase if they are used. Not only are such patches not painful, but they are more ecological. The patches have been in the works for far longer than any of the vaccines they can deliver, prompting questions about reasons for the delay. If a covid-19 vaccine can be rushed into production, surely microneedle patches can."

That has an efficacy of 95%, meaning 95 out of 100 vaccinated people will not get infected after exposure.  But let's look at more realistic analogues.  Take the influenza vaccine.  It's efficacy has varied tremendously.  I've seen number as low as 20% up to some 60%.

If we ever get to the point of releasing a vaccine, which could take years or even decades, we'll have reached a point where mortality may be little different than influenza as the virus will have killed off the vulnerable parts of the population."

President not only subdues experts but also makes unverified claims about drugs and promotes dangerous behavior. Add to that, the blatant politicization of even wearing a mask by Trump.

Was this inevitable? No; we had adequate warning about the virus; and we are far away from China where it originated. S Korea is so much closer to China and got the first infection of this virus around the same time we did.  They have suffered less than 300 deaths (population ~50 million or one-sixth the US).  If we had followed their example we could have had less than 3000 deaths - that's 95% fewer than our loss to date.
All S Korea did was enforce masks in public places, enforce social distancing, and did lots of testing early.  Not rocket science but requires leaders who listen to scientists and competently execute straightforward plans.
I guess with Trump as President that is asking for too much.  Republican Senators need to pay the price along with Trump for this slaughter of the innocents.

That is an editorial comment. I think the NYT would be a more effective organization if it did a better job of separating its opinions from its news reporting. 

The decision reflects the judgement of the EU that only 15 counties outside the EU have yet to establish control of COVID 19 to a sufficient degree to allow their residents to enter the EU. The residents of countries within the EU, including Britain,  may travel in the EU despite some of them still having high infection rates. There are 195 countries in the world, 27 of them are in the EU, 15 of them are allowed in, that leaves 153 countries still excluded, many of which have much better records against the virus than many or all of the EU countries. Plus residents of China  will be allowed in if residents of the EU are allowed in to China - from a healthcare perspective, does that make any sense? There are many questions to be asked about how this decision was made.

For the illusion of total freedom. For the illusion of prosperity. For the illusion of normalcy. For the illusion of leadership. For the illusion of happiness, what ever the costs may be.

For the preservation of the status quo. For the preservation of power. For the preservation of the system. For the preservation of the believes of all the followers of the man, no matter how crazy these believes are.

For that.

I've seen today's hearing. Even if there is a vaccine people will refuse it. And any door-to-door contact tracing will lead to dead tracers, mark my words..."

Until a great percentage of the population understands and commits to doing their part, the spread of the virus will explode out of control.

Wearing a mask and social distancing is easy. It is patriotic."
2020-06-30 17:34,""". . .  the number of new infections in the United States could more than double to 100,000 a day if the country fails to contain the surge that is now underway in many states.""

WOW - this statement is an extreme contradiction to the White House Coronavirus Task Force Coordinator, Mike Pence, who just stated last week that this group had ""flattened the curve, slowed the spread, saved lives"" as he and the administration did victory laps around the White House grounds.

So much for the celebration of states that were in the process of “safely and responsibly” reopening and pointed to improvements in certain employment and retail sales metrics as a sign of economic progress.

Apparently, Pence and pals are still stuck on that statement Trump made in February - ""The risk to the American people remains very low.""

As long as folks continue to refuse to comply with safe precautions like wearing mask and keeping a safe distance, I swear I don't know how this virus will ever be contained."
2020-06-30 17:45,"In NJ we just started allowing outdoor dining. The restaurants and wait staff are doing heroic jobs to help reopen the economy. But people are NOT helping. 

On Saturday night in Ridgewood NJ, I saw restaurant workers all in masks and many in gloves. Many people were at properly distanced tables enjoying themselves. Then you see the people on the sidewalks. NO MASKS. Just walking around. 

Presumably they thought they were “exercising” but they were blithely walking past people appropriately masked or at distanced tables. I saw in a park today hoards I’ve people coming well within 6 feet of each other, again presumably “exercising”. 

C’mon people! Use common sense! Your actions affect us all. Put your mask on except when absolutely necessary. Period."
2020-06-30 17:48,"Trump could have all but ensured his re-election by just copying what leaders in most other advanced countries were doing. 
Even that proved to be a bar too high for him. 
Instead, governors were left to pick up the slack which is problematic because unlike the EU, the responsible ones can't properly enforce a quarantine or close borders for people from problem states. 

The only silver lining is that Trump's poor handling of Corona has older people turning on him in droves. President Joe Biden is the only appropriate answer to the tens of thousands of people who died unnecessarily."
2020-06-30 17:39,"I live in NY, and I admire how Governor Cuomo has managed the virus.  He is now announcing that people from a number of states are going to have to quarantine themselves before they can visit.  He and no one else has announced how he is going to do that. They are coming!  I think the people of NY should get ready for a perilous summer, and a brutal fall.  The virus is about to reappear.  Cuomo knows. Nothing will keep the rest of the country out of the state. It is time to start shutting things down again and readying the hospitals for an onslaught of Covid-19 patients.  Administrators and teachers should not have to labor over re opening protocol.  They will not be open until- when.  Those are thoughts even heavy to type.  The sun is shining in NY, but it is going to get dark awfully fast.  If I were related to Cuomo I would be worried about his health.  Corona virus may not get him, but pressures of his job may surely effect him.  As he does the right thing, which I personally think he will do, I think we should support him every way he asks."
2020-06-30 18:18,"Of course we need officials at all levels of government to advocate and demonstrating wearing masks, distancing, hand-washing and other safety measures. 

We also need some messaging about masks with valves that allow exhalation. These are meant as industrial dust masks, but they are being worn now as covid masks. I see them in supermarkets and all over social media, where people think they are helping the covid containment efforts. At least one business selling supplies for home made masks is selling the valves, with instructions on how to add the valves to existing masks and a photo of an N95 mask with a valve installed. It would really help for one of these officials to speak about these valves and make it clear that masks with valves are not protecting others."
2020-06-30 17:33,"100,000 daily cases? OMG! Fauci's earlier warnings were totally ignored by President Trump and by other White House officials. Because of their 'don't care' attitude the virus spread like a forest wild fire and affected thousands every day. Now one more warning from Fauci. Do not know how seriously Trump and his ""Yes President"" supporters will take the present warning from Fauci. To save his countrymen Trump must shed his 'don't care attitude' and must follow all the advices and instructions given by health officials, if he wants to sit in the President's seat for the second time."

Amid America's #COVID19 disaster, I must come clean about a lie I spread as a health insurance exec: We spent big $$ to push the idea that Canada's single-payer system was awful & the U.S. system much better. It was a lie & the nations' COVID responses prove it.

As of Monday Canada had 103,900 COVID-19 cases and 8,569 deaths. While the US reported more than 2.5 million cases and 125,700 deaths. The US population is 10 times that of Canada.

We all know that Trump calls VP Biden “sleepy Joe”, disgraceful! Maybe we should call Trump “sleepy Donald” who has been asleep “at the switch” not only since COVID-19 started, but also numerous other important issues that has surfaced since he became “president” and has failed the American people."

Trump has failed miserably re Covid 19 ,along with many of his Republican governors following in his ignorance. A unified policy about mask wearing , staying at home and re opening would have helped. I hope the people who voted for Trump, will see that he failed miserably in this crisis. That, along with his horrible record and the added ignorance or lies about bounties on American soldiers should be the last straw. Voting for Trump again, makes you complicit in his neglect of the average American. By now, you should know that he is not an honorable man and is not smart or moral enough to be President.

Every day it's possible to see people out and about without a mask on, even when they are passing others closely (jogging, cycling, walking).  Perhaps it will only be when the situation really does look like the movie ""Contagion"" that everyone will wake up to reality--by which time it will far too late to save the country."
2020-06-30 18:14,"Shame and anger towards airlines who are selling middle seats.  All for money, forget about the virus.  

Airlines are crybabies.  They misuse their profits, excessively pamper their executives and then whine for massive government/tax payer bailouts.  

There needs to be a major re-think about the role of air travel in our society and throughout the world.  

Do people really need to travel across the country for a meeting?   Do people need to fly from the US to Barcelona for a fun extended weekend?  Do people need to make daily flights for consulting work?  How about those destination weddings?  Aren't there attractive places nearby to celebrate one's vows?

Try weighing the discomfort, expense and health dangers of constantly choosing air travel. Enjoying a far-away place, via air travel, is certainly a wonderful option.  But let's save it for the occasional event.

These recommendations. resulting in significantly less air travel - have very complicated repercussions.  The hospitality industry would have to reinvent.  Families whose relatives have spread themselves across the country - what about their milestones of weddings, graduations, births and funerals?  Difficult questions.  Climate change and Corona 19, with it's global spread, may be helping to clarify the way forward for flying those friendly skies."

Open the economy Trump demanded.

And the governors were willing to become subservient to Trump.
People became complacent due in part to the statements, lies, that Trump told.

Now, we are reaping the fruits, spoiled fruits, of reopening too far and too soon.

I agree the country needed to be vibrant again and grow the economy and get the unemployed back in the labor force.  
Yet I see many in stores without masks.  No semblance of social distancing.

For being the world leader in containing the virus and “flattening the curve”, why is it we citizens of this country are banned from travel to Europe with only a few exceptions?  Oh, I know.  We failed where other countries have accomplished what we didn’t.

While true some European countries are seeing a rise in infections, those leaders of those countries are willing to bite the bullet.  But, perhaps those leaders aren’t looking a poll numbers and using those numbers to govern as our sorry excuse for leadership apparently does.

Our country has some fine company, however, in the exclusion of travel to Europe-Brazil and Russia.  I never thought we would be included in such a list given our past leadership in science.

So, should we meet that forecast of 100,000 new cases, what will the President* say, or not do, this time around?"

At about the same time, President Trump suggested national borders should be closed to China and these parts of Europe... Then suggestion that internal borders be closed given the massive outbreak in the NYC area were in question .... 

The reaction was total partisan hysteria! 

Governor Cuomo said this in March: ""Trump has no authority to impose quarantine: ‘It would be illegal’"" ... YET, today, the same governor is threatening a quarantine on citizen of others States ... Illegal? 

Yes, the refusal to close down and concentrate all efforts on NYC and the one or two other places with major outbreaks early, requiring quarantines as New Zealand and Australia did  is why Covid slowly spread to the rest of the nation and we find ourselves where we are today."
2020-06-30 18:27,"Officials like Dr. Fauci and Dr Redfield can fight vaccine skepticism all they want but one of the biggest failures of this pandemic and the previous one in 2009 will remain a lack of a timely deployable vaccine. Swine flu vaccine in 2009 became available in Nov. 2009 after the pandemic had tapered off and 1000s had already died. I was hit hard in Sep but luckily survived without a vaccine. Being 10 years older places me in a vulnerable group and I am angry that despite millions of US Tax dollars have been sunk into companies just like they did for 35 years in a HIV vaccine, that are unlikely to deliver a safe and effective vaccine.

I have never taken anything that Dr. Fauci has to say seriously because without real deployable vaccine or Americans complying with CDC guidelines, I would not be surprised if his estimates are correct. I wish such numbers would scare Americans into following the CDC safety guidelines including wearing proper masks properly. Angela Merkel also did a fine job of scaring Germans by telling them 2/3rds of Germany could become positive for COVID-19. Germans seemed to have so far kept COVID-19 under wraps, primarily because of their advanced universal health care but also because of German discipline and obedience to complying to common sense safety rules.

Finally, I am very optimistic that henceforth the mortality rate will be low. We now know a lot that can be translated into saving senior lives and global vaccine trials are beginning in July."
2020-06-30 18:31,"Let Dr. Fauci and the medical team issue a set of directives that every state, county, and city must follow.  It is really that simple.

Tests results will be given within 24 hours for people with symptoms, within two days for people without symptoms. The state will cover the costs if one's health insurance or employer does not. In a few weeks, the systematic and regular testing of especially exposed people (like teachers) will begin."
2020-06-30 18:35,"If, as the CDC reported just last week, the likely actual Covid cases in the U.S. exceeded 20 million, that averages a bit over 100,000 per day for the 6 months from Jan - Jun. Of course, about 90 percent of that level is only being seen in retrospect, based on antibody tests.  That said, the 20 million level of actual infections would put the U.S. death rate on par with the science coming out of South Korea and Germany (that is, approx 6.5 tenths of 1%, with the vast majority of that, unfortunately, affecting people over 65 with pre-existing conditions that appear to increase risk.  So, is the expected 100,000 new cases per day really new, or is it just that testing is confirming far more of the actual total infections - with the actual total U.S. daily infections staying near constant overall as the virus spreads to new areas?  We need reporting that cuts through the alarmism to help understanding of the real risks."
2020-06-30 18:36,"It's peculiarly American that the EU's rejection of US travellers HAS to be perceived as some sort of insult - and an insult, presumably impudent, aimed directly at the POTUS.

There's no 'Trump rebuke' here - just a commonsense approach to preventing coronavirus spread from parts of the world where the Covid-19 pandemic is still active and growing. I mean, things are bad too in Brazil and Russia but I don't see anyone bristling about 'rebukes' directed at Bolsonaro or Putin.

And, really, does every report (and, I do mean EVERY report since this EU issue became live) have to claim the sentiment 'WE banned EU travellers first' - as if that somehow draws the sting of this 'rebuke'."

There is nothing scientific about protesting in the streets even if wearing a mask with all of  the shouting and tear gassing going on.  Can anyone explain this to me using science as the rationale?"

2020-06-30 18:50,"This report on today's Senate hearing on covid 19 focused on the safety, acceptance of a vaccine. But a vaccine is still in the future, and the efficacy and the duration of protection if any potential vaccine is still in doubt. So it seems this hearing was mostly about some salvation to be hoped for. But future hopes are a displacement, a distraction for the immediate problem at hand, which is an explosion of covid cases in several states.

I am tired of experts advising masks, as though that is THE solution. I find it weak for Fauci to advise school districts to consider viral activity as they reopen. Reports are we still don't do enough tests to gauge viral activity in a regions. Testing seems solely an individual, consumer driven action and not designed to aid public health planning. And do we know anything if the tests are only given to those with symptoms? 

A more productive hearing would focus on what our government is doing to protect us now: e.g. shoring up PPE, hospital resources and personnel and how far are we from providing adquate testing and contact tracing. The countries that have protected their citizens have not emphasized what the public needs to do but started out with government action, providing for supplies and testing/contact tracing programs. They did not begin and end with advising masks. With prompt, efficient government pandemic plans, Taiwan didn't even need to lock down."

To be safe the states will have to test everyone before schools open and during the year. I read an article that the best case scenario is we'll be dealing with covid 19 the next three years.

Not to mention injecting antiseptic or putting light ‘inside the body’?

How many hundreds of thousands of people have to die as a result of Trump’s venality and incompetence before voters will see the light - and sweep Trump and and his Republican sycophants and enablers out of office? How many millions of jobs must be lost, how many trillions spent trying to clean up the economic mess caused by Trump’s abject failure to confront the reality of this pandemic? He has not only failed to competently respond, he has made it much, much worse, encouraging America’s gun toting nut jobs to storm state capitals to oppose simple measures to prevent the spread of a lethal pathogen, spreading idiotic conspiracy theories, calling it a ‘hoax.’

I am deeply ashamed at our nation for having elected a total failure to the presidency--and frightened because Trump goes beyond failure to endanger our health, our well-being, and our status in the world.

So no matter what hairs the administration wants to split about ""you have more tests, you have more positive cases"" -- the deaths don't lie.

Airlines are crybabies.  They misuse their profits, excessively pamper their executives and then whine for massive government/tax payer bailouts.  

There needs to be a major re-think about the role of air travel in our society and throughout the world.  

Do people really need to travel across the country for a meeting?   Do people need to fly from the US to Barcelona for a fun extended weekend?  Do people need to make daily flights for consulting work?  How about those destination weddings?  Aren't there attractive places nearby to celebrate one's vows?

Try weighing the discomfort, expense and health dangers of constantly choosing air travel. Enjoying a far-away place, via air travel, is certainly a wonderful option.  But let's save it for the occasional event.

These recommendations. resulting in significantly less air travel - have very complicated repercussions.  The hospitality industry would have to reinvent.  Families whose relatives have spread themselves across the country - what about their milestones of weddings, graduations, births and funerals?  Difficult questions.  The virus and its global spread, may be helping to clarify the way forward for redefining the necessities of air travel."

This ""one-size-fits-all"" approach is immoral.  We treat the elderly that same as 20 and 30 year olds.  In the process the economy crumbles and the human suffering collateral damage skyrockets (i.e., over seven million new cases of childhood malnutrition with most of these kids now having lifelong learning impairment (Brookings Institute study), dramatic increases in domestic violence (UN), etc.).

You cannot lead without a certain amount of authoritarianism and culturally, left and right, we have been pushing back on any sense of a coherent benchmark/commonality grounded in common sense for my entire adult life. 

Here in Chicago the mayor didn’t want to make masks mandatory since some people “didn’t have access” to them or other some such nonsense (just mail them to them, for crying out loud); thankfully so far the collective brain of the city has responded mostly rationally. 

In a sane world every citizen would be forced to wear a mask and socially distance, and we would likely be in good shape. 

In this world, forces that condemned right wing protests somehow approved the George Floyd protests, and no one even knows what the laws are city to city, county to county, state to state, let alone what will be enforced (nothing, as far as I can tell).

2020-06-30 18:51,"It will probably get bad.

Contrary to what the Times has suggested, this is, by and large, not because of our politicians, be they Republican, Democratic, or Donald Trump.

It's because the coronavirus is a bad actor. It is highly contagious, and it is contagious in many asymptomatic people, people who don't realize they are putting others at risk.

We can slow the case rate with common sense, most importantly by wearing masks and avoiding large crowds, especially indoors. This also means avoiding mass protests, even for good causes (the virus doesn't care about your politics.  It is contagious regardless).

Continuing severe Draconian lockdowns is no longer a viable answer. They slow the virus, but since they don't allow immunity to develop, they don't prevent future surges. Strict lockdowns are doing far more harm than good. The world depends on global trade. Thanks to globalization and the closure of many US factories we depend on foreign countries for countless essential products.  Most medicines used in the US are made in China.

Only a vaccine will allow a return to normalcy. Development, testing, and production of a vaccine requires all hands on deck, including major pharmaceutical companies. Whatever you may think of big Pharma, we need them.

Today, pharmaceutical companies face an existential threat: literally tens of thousands of multibillion dollar lawsuits. We absolutely need tort reform, at least during the crisis, if we are to get a vaccine."

The majority of people in this country don't even know how to balance their check book, let alone read a graph.  The nightly news often shows the hardship of what citizens are dealing with, deprived of graduations, visits through windows to see grandma, restrictions for beachgoers, etc.  What might be more effective is to show true hardship, such as what happens to people who get this virus and their struggle to stay alive.  If the media would show emergency room situations, the difficulties our first responders are dealing with, what those stricken are going through, then the ""trauma"" of not being able to go out to dinner would pall in comparison.  We are in a full press emergency pandemic-we need too see why we are being asked to keep our distance and wear masks.  Perhaps we have lost our reasoning in a sea of statistics."

Is it possible to make in school work?  With enough resources I'd think so.

No surprise the top list of countries most affected by Covid-19 reads like BRIC only that now is UBRI. The United States has, at least here, joined the category. Not a surprise. Unlike EU, Canada and most elsewhere in the world,  U.S. has no real health care system aimed to heal and maintain a healthy population while assuring affordable care to people in low income brackets like teachers. Instead it reflects a for-profit system that didn't hesitate to make a large segment of the population addicted to pain killers. It has a police force that (as in 6/29 hearings) has shot the eyes of reporters and viciously cracked down protests. It has a ruling political class that would make any country in the world implode, not different from what dictators and their friends have. Even the best press in the country isn't capable of reporting about the health costs and the typical citizen has no worries to see their hospital bills overcharged as the healh insurance pays it (or do the high premiums do?). It is sad to see the US losing ground and becoming day by day less democratic, more unjust. While China has clearly advanced and overtaken the US role in the world, it is far from a democratic society."

This has been neglected in US so far, partially because of poor leadership and partially because our attachment to personal freedom. Countries like China, Hong Kong, Taiwan, South Korea, largely eliminated spread of the disease due to contact tracing( among other measures).
Testing itself is not enough, we need to isolate those who had prolonged contact with Covid-19 positive people.
Lack of cohesive, comprehensive approach to pandemic in USA is obvious and I am afraid now is already too late for any effective strategy. If I was a spiritual person, I would say only God can save us, but because I am not, I am speechless.

2020-06-30 19:12,"COVID-19 infections peaked on April 24, or so Americans assumed. State health authorities reported 36,738 new cases that day, a record. By mid-May, the United States had reduced that rate of infection by nearly half, to 17,618 on May 11. The accomplishment had come at a tremendous cost: the lockdown of much of the national economy, Great Depression levels of unemployment, the shift to online schooling for millions of children, families denied final visits to dying loved ones. Still, these sacrifices had delivered the desired result. Had that progress continued, the American people—and the American economy—could have likely foreseen a further decline in cases and perhaps a near end to the pandemic, even before a vaccine.

But that’s not what happened. On June 24, the number of infections surpassed the April 24 peak. On June 25, the number surpassed that of June 24. On June 26, the country suffered almost 46,000 new infections—nearly 10,000 more in one day than on the worst day in April. All of the sacrifices of the past weeks have been thrown away.

And, here you are, thrown back, after so much hard work and sacrifice. This is on Trump, this is his doing, but those around him (doing his bidding) must own this situation too."
2020-06-30 20:21,"I think it is both sad and rather comical that politicians use masks  as a political statement.  

Trump and his lackeys refuse to wear them as a political statement.

But others make a political show of wearing them. For example, look at Fed Chairman Powell during his public testimony to Congress today.  He doesn't even know how to properly wear a mask....he wore it UNDER his nose instead of over his nose.  Undoubtedly, he does not normally wear one and never even bothered to find out the correct way to wear one despite that he would be on national TV.

p.s. I am a mask wearer.  I wear a mask whenever I leave my home, both outdoors and when in any building (the only exception is when I am alone in my car).  I have been doing that since late January when the first case appeared in the county in which I live."
2020-06-30 19:45,"Why didn't Fauci and other scientist and public health professionals CLEARLY WARN, months ago, that re-opening was a very bad idea?

Trump has put them on a short leash and the press has muddled the science and the meaning.

Very easy to say this now, after the fact, when thousands more will die.

What about the Precautionary Principle and ""First, do no harm""?"
2020-06-30 19:55,"Today’s hearing made it clear that the health experts ( Fauci, Redfield, etc) now  refuse to be muzzled. In no uncertain terms, they laid out the dire consequences and risks that can spread from California and Texas to the rest of the country, including New York. 

We can’t afford to go backwards. We can’t afford to overwhelm our health system and put more people out of work. Close down inside service  at bars.penalize those who don't wear masks and congregate in large groups. 

The virus may not kill young adults but they have a responsibility to others, If enough if them  won’t modify their behavior, they must face the consequences, including penalties."
2020-06-30 19:55,"Before I begin my comment I need to address one issue that does not seem to go away, I am speaking of the constant questioning of VP Joe Biden's cognitive capabilities. Anyone who has done public speaking realizes the difficulty of keeping your thoughts without faltering, add a speech impediment to this(stutter) that you are trying to control in a venue familiar or not and you will find yourself either overlapping sentences or hesitating, combine a vulture of a Trump just waiting in the wings to see you fall flat on your face and you have an incident. VP Biden seems to be quite mentally capable to perform his duties not only as a candidate but as a President, Trump, on the other hand, can't even hold a glass of water, walk down a ramp, and speak clearly and concisely.

Now let us consider what we heard today in VP Biden's remarks, first we saw someone who was confident and spoke of scientific guidelines, masks, social distancing, he went as far as to state that he would not put anyone at risk. when asked about testing for coronavirus he stated that he did not get tested, that his secret service detail was tested, and he had no symptoms, should he then he would not hesitate to be tested. This is a leader, Trump constantly puts everyone at risk due to his vanity.

Mr. Biden also addressed the Russian scandal. We have seen him through the years discuss Mr. Putin's vile activities in no uncertain terms and you can be assured that he would never sell out the US. Trump, however?"
2020-06-30 19:54,"Trump does not care 2 hoots, while Mike Pence continues to remain fickle minded about the ''mask''. By some accounts of a few neutral observers, Trump presidency along with the COVID-19 imbroglio seem to resemble a byzantine novel, which divagates and meanders through a labyrinth of subplots and asides, but whose main theme goes no where, as if it is a movie made from shoestring budget. Such is the palpable pandemonium, and Trump might find ways to fish in trouble waters. 

And then there are those, who rebel and tirade against wearing masks (god love them). Come NIAID, FDA, and CDC chiefs calling and they are lined up for testifying before congress, with the prospects of being questioned by the congress, much to the chagrin of those who watch them passively. No matter their exhortations, especially Fauci's metronomic repetitions to wear masks, there is a decent chance their admonitions might go unheeded. 

Finally, the curve flattens upward like a snake. Trump continues to blow his own trumpet of having prevented about 1000,000 deaths from COVID-19 in the US. His flunkies give him a thunderous applause. All is well that ends well. Yeah, sure!"

Non mask wearers just don’t care pure and simple.  They feel bullet proof.  And maybe not too smart to begin with.

Wait until their beloved 87-year-old grandmother dies because some young person without a mask passed this disease onto the elderly person....the younger uncaring person will blame Trump or Cuomo.  He or she won’t take responsibility.

Maybe the Pandemic is an IQ test they failed..."
2020-06-30 20:24,"Wearing a mask is such a simple & small act. It can protect you and others. It is an act of courtesy, kindness and common-sense. Wearing a mask isn't a political statement. Simple act can save lives. Wear one, please!"

Ridiculous"
2020-06-30 20:31,I wish it were noted that masks are probably mainly beneficial when worn indoors.  The spread of the virus outdoors is minimal apparently.
2020-06-30 20:48,"I left my Ohio BMV office less than an hour ago after renewing my driver's license. The lack of public health protocols was appalling. Over two dozen people were forced to wait in a series of lines INDOORS for nearly an hour. 

Only about half the people in line wore masks. The BMV employee who processed my documents did not wear a mask. All the other employees I could see did. 

Beside breathing the same uncirculating air, the opportunities for spreading the virus by contact included unsanitized pens, writing tablets, credit card machines, eye test surfaces and counters. No hand sanitizer was offered or available. 

All the activities conducted at this BMV office could have been done by mail, online or through appointments. Forcing people to wait in line in close quarters is dangerous and unnecessary. 

If we are trying to restrict venues where the virus can spread, BMV sites like this one should be near the top of the list in every state."

2020-06-30 20:48,"The fact that states are reduced to trying (and assuredly finally failing) to keep the virus that respects and recognizes no geographical boundaries at bay tells you all you need to know about the incompetence of the Trump Administration.

2020-06-30 20:29,"The massive losses of US lives and jobs due to the virus are the responsibility of Trump. Period.
He dismantled the pandemic agency. He cut funds for CDC. He refused to listen to health experts early warnings. After 2 months he finally acknowledged the virus, yet refused to coordinate national standards and medical equipment resulting in chaos and confusion. 
Now, after 6 months and a major spike in cases, he is cutting funds for testing and health insurance for 23 million.  Make America Great Again: VOTE BLUE"
2020-06-30 20:35,Interesting that the number of COVID-19 cases reported today in Oklahoma was 585. Up a couple hundred from the past several days.
2020-06-30 20:41,"I am never anti-vaccine ... BUT ... there is SO much pressure to create a vaccine -- including using very new genomic technologies -- that I would certainly want to hear a lot about it (and, look, we don't have a vaccine at this point so this is quite speculative) before going with it.  Please don't put me in the same boat as the ""anti-vaxers"".  The Salk vaccine had an enormous trial phase and polio was every bit as scary as coronavirus.  Will we be doing anything like that??"
2020-06-30 20:59,"The Trump presidency was a nightmare prior to the coronavirus and the virus has laid bare it's incompetence.
 Now Americans can't visit Europe, Canada & other countries because 25% of the virus' cases & deaths have occurred in USA AND it's getting worse every day.  I have over 20 retired friends & relatives who winter in southern USA & none of them will be returning to USA this fall/winter.  Millions of Canadian 'snowbirds' will likely do likewise. The US--Canada border will likely remain closed to visitors until a vaccine is developed."
2020-06-30 20:48,"If masks protected the wearer everyone would wear one. 

But this is America.  The idea of doing something to protect someone else?  No matter how small.  No matter how minor.  In our country, that's socialism.  Wearing a mask is anti ethical to everything a large part of the country stands for."
2020-06-30 20:58,"Obtaining herd immunity is a dangerous delusion. Even if it is ""achieved"" the results are cataclysmic.

Assuming 50 to 70% of the total population have to be infected to reach herd immunity, in the US that would mean 150-200  million or so get sick. 30-40  million, Badly sick. Assuming 1% of the infected die, that works out to 1.5-2 million dead. 
That's if you succeed.

There is no guarantee of success. It has yet to be demonstrated that contracting COVID 19  imparts immunity at all. It may not, or it may impart immunity for a few weeks or months. Under those circumstances , herd immunity might never be achieved.
There is some indication, by no means definitive, that only temporary immunity is imparted. The implications for an effective, long term vaccine are obvious.

So little is known that herd immunity is not a viable strategy, and given its horrible results, it is a strategy that borders on cruelty. COVID tends to kill predominantly those above say 60 with co-morbidities...but it also ravages younger people imparting  lung damage and even brain damage. There have even been, thankfully rare, cases of child morbidity.

No, we cannot pursue herd immunity right now. We have got to stick with what we know works and reduces the numbers of those infected, sickened and dying.

We have to test, trace, isolate and social distance until a therapy or vaccine come along."

2020-06-30 21:11,"“We are now having 40-plus thousand new cases a day,” Dr. [Anthony] Fauci said. “I would not be surprised if we go up to 100,000 a day if this does not turn around. And so I am very concerned.”

Donald Trump will not be pleased. Translation: look for the economy to take another nosedive. Soon. And for a long time.

Dr. Fauci's résumé is impeccable. He will not have trouble finding a new position if he wants one (at his age). My concern is that the ""president"" will trash the doctor going out the door. It's just another problem with leadership--or the lack of it.

We need a sane voice among the chorus of insanity that is the Trump White House."

Contact tracing might tell us a lot about why there are surges in the South and West: because of political rallies? street protests? beaches, bars, churches?  But no, in the ""land of the free"" we're free not to know.  

And there is no ""political debate"" about masks.  There is only the Russian agent's self-obsession that saving ourselves from the virus he has embraced as a political tool is an affront to him.  That's not a ""debate""; that's the difference between sane and insane.  No wonder we are where we are (not coincidentally in the same league as Brazil and Russia)."
2020-06-30 21:25,"I notice Biden wasn’t wearing a mask during his news conference today. Perhaps when he’s not criticizing Trump for not wearing one, he realizes that the American people at least want to see their leader’s face. He also admitted he had not been tested for the virus. Trump has been, but never mind. He then gave some lame excuse about his secret service all being tested negative. What does that prove? At the end he put his mask back on.  A big point of contrast with Trump, you know. But does the virus know when the conference is over? The mask just a political statement, I guess."
2020-06-30 21:28,"What has Mr. Trump done for so-called Amreican Exceptioalism lately?  Well, he has seen to it that the U.S. is regarded as a failed-state in relation to the handling of the Corona virus pandemic, such that citizens of the country are not to be allowed in the E.U.
But I suspect he will reassure us that he knows more than the doctors, just like he knows more than the generals."
2020-06-30 21:15,"I wish the government would crack down on large gatherings, which have and are exponentially spreading the virus. Too many young people are concerned about their own rights but not a whit about the lives of their older relatives."
2020-06-30 21:34,"The rationale for the lockdown was to flatten the curve. the curve has been successfully flattened (stats experts will note that the # of cases under the curve are the same, it is simply the time delay that allowed hospitals not to be overwhelmed.

ICU capacity has been raised, and successful interventions and treatments have been developed (proning patients, dexamethasone is shortening hospital stays and reducing deaths).  Many of the recent cases are young and healthy people, who have a much lower risk of death or severe symptoms.

Protect the nursing homes - that is key.  Don't do what Cuomo did and send Covid-positive residents back into the population of the nursing homes.  NY's death rate was 4x that of Texas, Florida, and CA despite similar total populations (and Florida has more elderly residents).  

The reopening is working, flattening the curve is working, a vaccine may never be successfully developed; time to start learning how to live with this disease and balancing the costs of mitigations against the gains; kids need to be in school (not on video), people need to work.  The vulnerable need to protect themselves, which means we should focus on bringing food to the elderly in a safe manner and focus testing around nursing homes."

Although we all hope it is true, to claim that we can open schools because children cannot infect one another is not yet warranted and is potentially dangerous - Fauchi should have corrected him."
2020-06-30 22:01,"Donald Trump is a serious problem. However he is not THE problem but a manifestation of it. 
It looks very much as if the focus on masks in your country is partisan by both sides. And THAT is the problem. Or at least a more fundamental problem than Donald Trump. A conflict culture. One where Trump was elected not because many people really believed he was their friend, but because he was the enemy of their enemy, so that was worth it. 
At the same time as one group of people prefer risking community health to following measures that are advocated by the other side, people on the other side prefer risking community health to letting the first group save face and move on to safer behaviour without crowing and finger-pointing.
Masks alone are inadequate. Widespread mask wearing is only a necessary tool where there is significant community spread (spread where the source of any particular case cannot be traced and quarantined.)  The strongest focus should remain on staying at home and social distancing until the rate of spread is low enough (as determined by medical pandemic specialists) to ease off. Not scoring points off the other side."
2020-06-30 22:12,why is the number on the increase in cases relevant if the increase in cases is not matched by an increase in deaths?
2020-06-30 22:08,"I veer between disappointment, outrage and a kind of despairing sadness.

So many people died here in NY; so many doctors and nurses, PAs, EMTs, therapists, and other staff suffered here. So many suffered serious illness with long term results. So many families grieved. No city should have to call for refrigerator trucks, just to house the dead.

We showed people the object lesson, and no one really listened. Folks, your politicians are killing you. Are you really going to accept that?"
2020-06-30 21:37,How come we’re not talking about the mass protests in early June? No politicians or public health experts talked about the risks of Covid at the time. So now we’re back to Covid. The message is politically skewed and people just want the truth. Not selective truth.
2020-06-30 22:31,"The number of cases per day from COVID-19 will go up to record levels very soon, I think ... and as Dr Fauci today expressed serious concern over. And so will the number deaths from these. As a minimum, wearing a mask would, as a minimum, tacitly convey the message that we are in this situation together to deal with the threat communally. But many refuse to do this. And that may reflect most of the problem we have ... which Trump provides no leadership about for various reasons including ineptitude. It’s as if people who are risk-takers ... and there are so many ... arrogantly going it as they will, don’t realize or don’t care that their getting sick probably means someone else getting from them. Undisciplined freedom is problematic."
2020-06-30 22:32,It is too late for Lamar Alexander to speak as to the President’s behavior.  He had his chance during the impeachment and he made the wrong choice.
2020-06-30 22:21,"It is possible to restart the economy if the virus is controlled. It works OK in my tiny nation. At least for the time being we are almost back to normal, except for crowded bars, restaurants, large gatherings, and the tourist industries are still down at low levels. Masks are not even common in Denmark. 

But we can only do it because we for now control the virus with only 15-30 daily cases registered. It took almost 6 weeks of harsh lockdown with intensive testing and tracing. But apparently we can't weed out the virus completely.

In the US you never had a nationwide serious response to the pandemic, and your president did his best to ignore and ridicule such a response. You flattened the curve at a rather high level, and now the numbers rise fast again. 

You can argue the fatality is ""only"" some 0.5-0.8%, but how many dead Americans will that be in a year? And without an effective vaccine, will it be every year? Lasting herd immunity is most likely a pipe dream with a mutating virus around.

Many US states should take another round of lock-down, and this time do it honestly and seriously, instead of playing a fools game with your so called president, his acolytes and his propaganda media. No matter what, squandering the first lock-down will prove expensive in lives and economy, but the most expensive is to do nothing."

I do not trust that the Trump administrations will not try to fast track a wildly profitable and much desired vaccine that is neither safe nor effective. At this point I do not know that I would trust anything that wasn’t also being approved in Europe or Canada. There is so much money to be made and Trump’s re-election could hinge on a vaccine.

But we have nothing but lies and manipulated data from Trump’s administration, and most of us knew from the start all he cares about is the economy, his re-election and keeping himself and Pence out of prison until 2025. The bridge to Ontario, Canada is three blocks from our house. Useless. Many businesses on both sides are ruined. The little bit of tourism we’re seeing isn’t going to be enough to keep most motels open. And I know we’re headed for another shutdown, but we’re also headed for protests like we saw in Michigan. Between those protestors and the anti-masks there’s some real toxic stuff going on with people this time. 

It will be these next 8-12 months where we come undone. The luxury of unemployment + cares money and stimulus checks will be absent this time around. Already I see people trying to get approved for SSI who aren’t disabled. Where are we going to work if we have another shutdown and 30% more businesses are gone? The fear I see is palpable. Where are we going to live if we can’t pay our rent? How will single adults with no kids get food stamps? These are all questions we are going to need answers to. And nobody in the White House or our representatives seem concerned about this."

We saw passionate women on video in W. Palm Beach screeching at lawmakers for requiring masks.  They are the epitome of some 15% - 30% of the US that pride themselves in defiance against any regulations that impede their personal freedoms.

There is, of course, nothing wrong with a little pride and glory, but along with those virtues comes another: humility. Not only have we developed an ingrained belief in our unalienable right to do and say whatever we please, we also have developed the notion that we can conquer anyone and anything. Then along comes a killer virus that does not give a fig about our unalienable rights, our mighty economy, or military prowess, etc. Yet, many of us beg to differ and go about our business as usual, because, after all we, Americans, are “exceptional”. And now we are suffering the consequences: more than 125,000 Americans dead with who knows how many more to come, the rest of us having become outcasts and pariahs—probably for the first time in history the everyday American is not welcome in Europe—our economy in taters, and so one. The time for humility, America, is now!

For states with a high rate of infection, there should be travel restrictions or they will spread this everywhere.  Just think, an infected person in Florida can just get on a plane to any city with restrictions. It is up to them to quarantine for two weeks. What is the chance that will happen?  In other countries, infected areas were closed off.  Second, everyone needs to reduce their mobility and level of interactions with others. To contain the virus, we need to reduce our social contacts by 80-90%.  The easiest way is to limit trips to areas with large numbers or gatherings of people.  You can support businesses by takeout or order and curbside pickup.  AND by all means wear a MASK.  There is no other way.  If people want to place the burden on the other guy or they feel silly distancing, then there will be so many sick people and the bankrupt business that this country will not be the same again.

That spike is seeing about 70 new cases a day. For us, that's massive, and has meant that my state (South Australia, next door to Victoria) has decided to keep it's border closed to all Victorians for the forseeable future. Here in SA we have not had a new case of community transmission in over a month, and we intend to keep it that way, effectively sending the state back to pre-covid.

40,000 cases a day and Americans just shrug; 70 cases a day and Australia collectively loses our minds and shuts down our second most populous state, and second biggest city. Let that sink in for a bit."

Was the unique ability to afford and use air conditioning in mass the Brazilian trap too? I realize that a few folks in these places refuse to wear masks, which I’m sure is contributing to the problem, but that can’t be the whole story. What would happen if instead of shutting down the economy, governors and local leaders in these regions turned off air conditioners in non-essential places as a way to encourage people to practice social distance, be outdoors more, avoid sitting in groups, and literally, take the heat like most other people living under similar climate conditions have done from the beginning of time?"

The pharmacy has plexiglass screens to prevent contagion and hand sanitizer.

I'd think that given the effectiveness of masks mentioned by the CDC, we'd see better results.  Getting society and the economy open is critical.  I may be missing it, but if you don't have a health issue, is wearing a mask that burdensome along with some social distancing?  In the last few days, I have gone to two restaurants and sat inside.  I wore a mask in until I was seated.  Total mask time from car to table - 2 minutes in each case.  I also stopped at Home Depot and wore a mask for 30 minutes - I survived - hopefully someone else will too.

But if Trump wears a mask, it will be a very visible sign that he has been massively, tragically, fatally wrong.

A real man, whatever his faults, would back down and wear the mask at this point, but we all know Trump's tender, delicate, cowardly ego will not permit that.  He is not a man, but a voracious narcissist, constantly needing fawning validation instead of thinking of others.  So he will go on not wearing a mask, and tens of thousands, maybe hundred of thousands of his followers, will continue to die and to infect others as they emulate their leader's vanity and breathtakingly stupid denial of reality."

The thing that gets me is that our surge here was so bad, and that was with everything shutting down a few weeks in advance -- clinics, elective cases, restaurants, schools, events etc...but the current group of states is surging and trying to manage so far without the measures we were all taking in April upfront...I guess we have masks as a weapon now (nobody was really masking in March, April) but I feel like this surge is going to be way worse at this point."

2020-07-01 2:56,This virus has shown people everywhere the weaknesses in their governments. Our government counts on its citizens to use reason but since we’ve opened up there’s a sort of madness in the air.... and our covid 19 count is going up again. The economy is a powerful force for the health officials to counterbalance successfully.
2020-07-01 2:45,"Why can’t people do the minimum and wear masks, if they really want to return to ‘normal’ and allow businesses to reopen ? Trump has been responsible for a lot of missteps and is still refusing to set an example, but that doesn’t mean people can’t have some common sense of their own ... oh right, that’s what seems to be missing from a good chunk of our population !

This is increasingly on the people themselves who are helping the virus to spread, through denial of reality. One sign of a civilisation in decline - it took a virus to see tangible proof of the disconnect, years in the making.

Among people who have been interviewed as to their nonchalant attitudes, one has said that he’d have to see it for himself first (whatever that means), and another, who actually lost family members to the virus, thinks masks are a ‘placebo’ (likely misunderstanding the meaning of the word and how masks work)."
2020-07-01 2:51,"I can only conclude that trump and the Senate Republicans have abandoned their leadership role and are surrendering to the virus. It appears that our leaders have made the decision to achieve herd immunity without a vaccine. 

Given we are a population of 360 million, and 75% herd immunity is required, this means that 270 million Americans will necessarily become infected. 20% of this amount will become seriously ill or 54 million. The health care system only has 1 million beds so many will need to either try and recover at home or die at home. With a 5% death rate amongst the seriously ill, 2.7 million may die and an untold number will be left with chronic disease and issues for the remainder of their lives.

What a waste when other countries in the world have proven that this path is not necessary.

Make America Great Again? I think not."
2020-07-01 3:07,"As for the Senate Republicans extending the small-business program: When will they finally do a program--a decent, humane and adequate well-funded program--for the duration of this once-in-a-century pandemic, for everyday Americans?--a program that protects jobs (instead of forcing us to grovel at unemployment offices), preserves an adequate proportion of incomes (instead of a single paltry $1,200 payment over four months), makes sure their families have enough food (instead of attempting to kick a million of us off of food stamps), and guarantees affordable access to health care (instead of killing Obamacare and taking health care away from tens of millions."
2020-07-01 3:24,"A bit of reflection and introspection would be useful.

There is an obvious bias that an increase is bad. Is that really the case? 5 year from now, might we think that this is actually good?

Ask individuals under 25 - they are people too. What do they think? My bet is that most feel that they should just get infected, probably not get sick, and be done with it. The kids are not afraid. So from their perspective (which you must value, as they are human), the increase is not only okay, it is good.  

Who really knows what will happen? Clearly, the elderly and those at risk must mitigate their own risk. Perhaps individuals will take care to be more health conscious (to mitigate their risk). 

I think what is happening is that the so called adults - those older than 50, are straight up scared and they express their fear through the vehicles of power at their disposal - the media. 

I do hope that the spread of Covid declines and that folks stay safe, but it would be interesting to see a newspaper led and published by individuals under 25. Do we not trust them? Is that the message we are really saying? Because that seems to be the message. Perhaps it's time to check your own bias. Remember, the kids are not afraid....let's just lock them up....that is one solution."

Their refusal to wear them is why I’m not going shopping anywhere in-store. Anxious to know how much revenue businesses are losing because they’re not getting help from state and local authorities re: mask ordnances. How many people are scared to shop because of these no-maskers?

ALL states need federal mask guidelines due to the failures of  Trumpian states. It’s like George Wallace’s stand in the schoolhouse door! I so hoped Dr Fauci would address the mask crisis today, especially since some school districts will not require masks when they reopen for classes in spite of surging cases.  HOW? Just imagine a veteran teacher having to lead a classroom of “we ain’t gonna wear no stinkin’ mask” kids. Why should she have to put her health at such risk? 

The governor of Alabama said she had no plans to force a statewide mask mandate because “people should be responsible enough to wear one without being forced.”  But then, she admitted that she couldn't force anything new because people weren’t doing what she’d previously ordered! Worst part is that she said all of this without a mask on, standing two feet away from other people. I am so fed up with the STOOOOOPID. And 50th in education is no easy feat in this country!

“Hey y’all we’re openIn’ the schools as cases are surgin’, but don’t worry ‘bout no masks! You know science is just an opinion.”

In the Northeast we have roughly three months of outdoor dining and activity weather remaining, then what. 
No state has come up with a truly safe plan to reopen schools at the end of August, then what? That applies to colleges and universities as well.

This would certainly go a long way to please his supporters and set a good example. There’s nothing wrong with wearing a mask ￼￼and they have even become a fashion symbol.

2020-07-01 5:13,"I now understand the seriousness of this current state of virus potential. Deferring to Fauci's learned opinion, it occurred to me, unlike a flu which recedes in warmer weather and is of a seasonal nature, the Coronavirus has appeared to have gained vigor in the warmer weather. This is NOT a Flu. It's more than early reopening that allowed it to flourish and spread. There is something else. It is either the temperatures of summer or the relative moisture content or humidity in the air. Observing the graph of daily infections reported, we are now incurring the most infections and against Trump's and Pence's claims of the simpleton view of more testing makes more cases, consider that those who sought tests had symptoms, not simply those who were asymptomatic who likely felt no compulsion to be tested. The fact is those tested positive, are actually sick. I know that can be challenging to some, but it is dark at night and light in day. It really is that simple. This nation is in trouble. The television appears to be a serious vector of spread as the misguiding of leaders is portrayed everywhere to an audience trained all their lives to watch TV every day. This likely prompts counter intuitive reckless conduct. Trump is a cheerleader who may have done well before in sparking economic growth with encouragement, but now it's reckless endangerment of the entire nation as all flocks are led astray."

Here in Singapore the rules around their use seem to illustrate this: We are forced by law to wear them them when walking in breezy parks or on paths, where there is v little risk of transmission, but allowed to remove them when eating and drinking at indoor, AC restaurants,  where there is presumably a real risk of transmission.

What made them think they would be immune? While we were shutting down here (too late), my friend in Florida reported that her colleagues were having a large meeting and a pizza party, refusing to wear masks even in stores, and even now they are forcing her to go to work and interview prospective employees in person, when she could easily do her job at home."

Much of Florida’s new surge in cases appears to follow from the reopening of beaches, bars, restaurants and other social activities.

2020-07-01 5:00,"The Trump Virus has gutted the US. Trumps response has proven him to be the most selfish, incompetent, reckless and manipulative leader on earth. We've seen a better response, and better results in the third world.
Trump is out of his league. His failure to protect his own should be a catalyst for his resignation. No question."
2020-07-01 9:34,Donald Trump will probably celebrate the fact that America leads the way in Coronavirus cases. After all he wants America to be First.
2020-07-01 9:24,"If you don't follow the safety protocol...masks...distance...hygiene, you place yourself and others in a very precarious situation.  I just heard of a small group of men who went on a long weekend holiday.  5 men with 1 in the group suffering from what he was sure was ""allergies"".  He says his doctor didn't think he needed to be tested since he gets seasonal allergies.  No masks, no distance, shaking hands with others at this hotel.  They had a great time until a week to 10 days later...when 4 of the 5 were diagnosed with COVID, along with 2 wives who were infected by their husbands at home.  It seems the guy with ""allergies"" DID have COVID and gave it to his fellow travelers, and ultimately to the 2 wives....and God knows how many others.  If you're not feeling well...if you ""think"" you have seasonal allervies or the common cold, DEMAND your doctor test you.  DEMAND it!  And please follow the protocol when you're out and about!!"

2020-07-01 6:42,"Wow.  Many of the comments to this section of these posts (comments that were posted today it seems) have thousands of recommends.  People are angry.  Our government is failing us, and people (hopefully) seem to be waking up."

2020-06-29 13:17,"I’d been thinking that we needed to hear more accounts of young people being severely impacted by the virus.  Please continue to do this, as it will help convince the younger generation that they’re also vulnerable.  I still see many young people on our sidewalks without masks."
2020-06-29 13:31,"This paragraph caught my attention: “But over the weekend Ms. Estrada, 37, was fighting the virus at Houston Methodist Hospital after a week of treatments that included an experimental drug, steroids, intensive care and high doses of oxygen. She probably contracted the virus while attending a dinner with relatives who had also been cautious, she said. Within days, all four adults and several children who had been at the gathering tested positive for the coronavirus.”
It’s tempting to go out with family or friends who you think is as careful as you are but...this stop me from even thinking about getting together with anyone!"
2020-06-29 13:29,"Why would there be a “peak” with such modest containment efforts?  Seems like instead of exponential increases they might see a more linear increase, but still a daily increase.  NY had a peak because of a severe SIP."
2020-06-29 13:24,"I’d hope that governors whose states were hit hardest earlier, like Cuomo, are either being asked advice or giving it to Governor Abbott and others on how to handle the surge in patients. I’d hate to think that ideology would discourage cooperation and communication between the two when so many lives are at stake."
2020-06-29 13:32,"Regarding Ms. Estrada, it would be helpful to know the details of the ""dinner with relatives"" where the attendees are thought to have contracted the virus. Was it indoors? Outdoors? How many attended? Now people are trying to get clarity on what can be done safely. Many of us are assuming that small outdoor gatherings are OK, particularly where some distance is maintained. If this was an outdoor gathering with only a dozen people who maintained some distance, many of us would have to rethink what we thought we knew about how this virus spreads."
2020-06-29 13:34,"A virus is an infectious agent that reproduces inside the cells of living hosts. When infected, the host cell is forced to rapidly produce thousands of identical copies of the original virus. Unlike most living things, viruses do not have cells that divide; new viruses assemble in the infected host cell. 
A virus is as indifferent to politics, race, age and money as well as every other random category we assign ourselves. 
Respect the virus, respect each other, respect yourself and we'll get through this. 
Pretend you're better or special ... results to date speak for themselves."
2020-06-29 13:49,"There's one short sentence in the article that caught my eye: about the inundated public hospitals.
It's important to note that this article is about a well funded private hospital. If things are bad there, just imagine how fire the situation is at the county facility. That's what happened in New York, and it was really dark.
Our healthcare system is broken. Research shows lower costs and better, more equitable, outcomes in countries with universal health care coverage."
2020-06-29 13:51,"As this virus is a cold it’s possible that we won’t find a shot for it. Other than MERS, SARS and COVID-19 there are about 5 colds that affect us and they keep coming back, you don’t get permanent immunity to colds, so it’s possible that social distancing is here to stay. Also we don’t even know if viruses are even living things. I assume they are but if not we can’t kill it. 

Masks help a bit but a virus can slip through like you can walk through an open garage door."
2020-06-29 13:46,"In a couple of weeks, Houston will be where Chicago was about a month and a half ago. Chicago is now ‘opening up’ after a much more lengthy quarantine period. It will be telling if Chicago did it right or if the spread is inevitable and there is no avoiding it."

2020-06-29 13:37,"Each photo of the young, ""otherwise healthy"" patients suggests obesity. In America today, where 42% of adults are obese, this might seem like nothing, but it's very clear from the data that this virus preys on the obese. One of the best things you can to protect yourself from this disease is to change your habits; eat less sugar, exercise (a lot), and try to get your BMI below 25."
2020-06-29 13:47,"Governor Abbot should close down every non essential business till the virus is somewhat under control. The local government have for weeks urged people to wear a mask and avoid gatherings but when the Governor overrides that, there is  very little the Mayors and County Judges can do. Why can't the Governor close down parks, gyms, public pools, big box stores, restaurants for at least a  week? Are these really essential businesses? Why can't the Governors put people's lives above everything else? What good is an economy when the ERs are on full capacity, when the front line workers have to bear the brunt of all all this political  divide?"
2020-06-29 14:07,"As a RN I am so sad that these non-mask wears don’t care about the overwhelming and overworking that is happening.

2020-06-29 14:11,"The NYT needs articles on the lasting effects of the virus. My parents (70s) tested positive in March and have had cyclical bouts of illness with the same, though diminished, symptoms as when the virus was most active in their systems. While I never received any official COVID diagnoses, I believe I had it in at the end of January. Like my parents I too have had sporadic bouts of feeling ill out of nowhere over the last 6 months. I am a 29 year old female. We may not have a great chance of dying, but we may live with the effects until we do. Start googling and tell your friends to do the same, because you’re going to start seeing comments like mine more often."
2020-06-29 13:56,"Basically, Greg Abbott cares more about kissing up to Trump than he cares about the people of Texas.   He opened the state way too early with little to no restrictions and now  ICUs in hospitals are being over run.  What a terrible predicament Texas is in right now."

2020-06-29 14:00,"Seceral parts caught my eye- the first one being ""On Saturday evening, after making rounds, Dr. Faisal Masud, the medical director for critical care across all of Houston Methodist’s hospitals, described the younger virus patients in the I.C.U.s. “Typically there are definitely 30-year olds, 35-year olds,” he said, adding that the most severely ill young people often are obese or have medical problems such as diabetes, kidney disease and high blood pressure."" the second is if you look at the photos- Mr. Ezell - even at 37 was in for heart failure and is indigent, Mr. Fryar is obviously overweight - both men are not ""healthy young people""- unless that definition has radically changed."
2020-06-29 14:09,"Yes, these people are young. They might consider themselves healthy. But they look obese or overweight. Healthy obese or overweight remains an entity to be proved to exist."
2020-06-29 13:59,"One problem with this virus are the science-deniers who will walk through a store, never wearing a mask. They brush past, you can feel their breath as they go by. Carrying two grocery items. We had one old woman without a mask push her grocery cart the wrong way, through our line, we had to let her squeeze by. She had an angelic smile and kept saying ""Thank you"" when my wife pointed out that masks are required. There are all sorts of weird people out there, folks, ignoring the rules and common sense. Yesterday in Jacksonville an irate shopper without a face mask deliberately coughed in the face of a woman who was recording her. You're literally risking your life, saying anything to these people without masks."
2020-06-29 14:00,"When you ""attend dinner with relatives who are also being cautious,"" then you yourself are not being cautious at all.  All it takes is one person who is not being cautious enough to attend one of these family events and infect a dozen people.  This is exactly how the virus spreads.  The alternative is to not see any of your friends or family except outdoors, socially distanced.  It's ver difficult for human beings to do this over long periods of time.  We're social animals."
2020-06-29 14:01,"This is a pretty low key article, given that impending death and disability is imminent all across Texas and neighboring states, largely because of political brinksmanship by Republicans at the state and national level."
2020-06-29 13:58,"The critically ill that are stressing hospital systems are only one piece of this. The cases that prove fatal are only one piece of this. The biggest thing we have to realize is that we do not know the long-term effects of the virus. For huge numbers of people, it may very well lead to a lifetime of disability. We will know a lot more in the next six months. WEAR A MASK!"
2020-06-29 14:02,"For those who don't live here, please cease and desist with your generalizations that Texans don't believe in science and don't want to protect ourselves and others. Many of us vigorously disagree with what our governor is doing, didn't vote for him, and are not Republicans. The large cities here are Democrat. We wear masks and social distance. We have no control at all over what the government does. 

My wife works for a large hospital north of Houston that is overwhelmed with COVID patients and is quitting because they refused to offer proper PPE and test her and other employees for COVID-19. For unknown reasons, they were selective in who they protected, even though they had no shortages. 

A health care worker had to choose between her job and her health because they would not make it a priority. My wife chose her health over money. Unfortunately, she doesn't know yet if she was successful. She awaits the results of a third COVID-19 test."
2020-06-29 14:08,"Please, please get the word out about the risk factors for serious disease. I couldn’t help but note that all four of the patients you showed are probably obese (BMI 30 or greater). If you are in that category, and you catch the disease, no matter your age you are at risk to be sicker. 

I see pregnant women in my area not wearing masks. They, too, are at greater risk, and so are their babies. Too many people are not aware of additional issues, like weight and being pregnant, that out you at risk for worse disease. That information is crucial."
2020-06-29 13:23,"What is so frustrating when seeing stupid people going, ""THE MORTALITY RATE IS LESS THAN 1%"" is missing the big picture. Mortality rate is only one issue, the other, and in my view the more pressing issue was the capability to handle it to prevent the mortality rate going up. What we are seeing in Houston with ICU's reaching max capacity is the worst case scenario. Then you reach a point where you decide who gets an ICU bed, a breathing machine, and finally a ventilator. That's when your mortality rate increases since people will not receive treatment with the hope to fight it off. 

Nope, thinking critically confuses people. Sadly seeing inept leadership in Texas and Florida along with other states with people whining about masks and public drinking is what's leading the US to be the worst outbreak on earth. Then what do we see due to American stupidity? Houston. We see what's happening in Houston and people who tried their best to coexist with covid, be smart about it, but still get sick likely due to some moron they passed by at the grocery store or elsewhere that's avoidable. If we cut out poor leadership and American selfishness and stupidity, we would have turned a page here."
2020-06-29 14:16,"Here in Houston doctors are seeing more cases (from younger-aged patients), restaurants are having to re-close due to infected staff, offices are re-closing as employees contract Covid, Covid drive-through testing lines are longer and masks are now mandatory for going inside stores etc..  Sadly, I still saw shoppers in the grocery store and pharmacy this past weekend ignoring county orders on mask wearing.

I truly believe our mayor and county judge (both Democrats) have tried to keep us safe.  Unfortunately, they have been overruled on business reopenings, mask wearings, etc. by Governor Abbott (Republican).  Our governor now seems to be stunned by the amount of negative national media attention he is receiving for his poor decisions during a global health crisis."
2020-06-29 13:55,Have Mr Abbott and Mr Cruz work in the hospitals for a change. They and the addled youths have and are risking the lives of health care workers.

2020-06-29 14:20,"I am deeply troubled by this article and I feel for all those patients, who were mislead by politicians in charge of their healthcare.
American exceptionalism is a joke , America is exceptional in the world for the worst outcome of this pandemic, having boasted about the superiority and preparedness of their ( flimsy in my opinion ) healthcare."
2020-06-29 14:22,"How quickly Americans forgot, or worse never knew or believed of, the mass graves in New York just a few months ago. 

If the sight or knowledge of mass graves so close to home was not enough to snap people into reality, then we are doomed to lose more citizens and livelihoods to Covid19. 

Of course the world's hope is in science but we must do our part while the scientists and medical minds work for more understanding of this virus and the diseases it causes. Help those scientists that are desperately trying to help humanity by wearing a mask, washing your hands and limiting contact.

For those who believe that God is the answer, the same message applies as God helps those that help themselves. Wear a mask, wash your hands and limit contact."
2020-06-29 14:19,"Young people tend not to follow up on the first thing they hear regarding a particular subject.  With Covid they heard that it almost exclusively struck the elderly.  In the span of a few months, that has become very old news.  They and the rest of us need to also understand that scientists and medical professionals still have a great deal to learn about Covid 19.  They pass that info along to us as it becomes available.  Also bear in mind that it IS the infectious disease experts one needs to listen to.....NOT Trump, his press secretary, or Jared Kushner just to name a few.  Don't like wearing a mask and social distancing and lots of hand washing? You are really going to hate the ventilator should you be critically stricken."
2020-06-29 14:13,"Much has being written about an “ability” of the young to not get sick. However this is really about how the young recover better and quickly when in the ICU.

If hospitals become overwhelmed, and none of the actions taken today will reduce infections till three weeks from now, the death rates of the young will very much increase and reach parity (or even exceed) the death counts of NY and Boston. 

And this was all preventable had we had effective and empathetic leadership."
2020-06-29 14:10,"Thanks. We need more articles like this that focus on younger patients. 

Unfortunately some politicians place the economy above lives. This will get worse unless they abruptly shut down again - in a big way- and start doing yet more testing and tracing."
2020-06-29 14:26,"A moral dilemma is looming for medical personnel.Because so many Americans insisted on their ""freedom rights"" with no thoughts for others, many hospitals are about to be overwhelmed.Doctors, nurses and technicians will once again be asked to work double/triple shifts in very dangerous environments. Having done it once already, are they to be forgiven for saying ""not again"".The partygoers, bar hoppers and the politicians that let them loose prematurely should have thought of the possible consequences.Bring in some doctors from Cuba?"
2020-06-29 14:27,"It is clear that Texas and Florida re-opened too soon and too wide, but what is surprising me even more is California.

As of yesterday California was reporting 5502 new cases and yet the governor is re-opening the state.  The new cases have been increasing at rate equal to or greater than Texas.

By contrast Texas reported 3657 new cases yesterday and have shut down the bars, mandated masks and further restricted restaurants.

I would like to understand what California is doing.  It seems counter intuitive.  Maybe the NYT should do an article."
2020-06-29 13:34,"I find it difficult to understand how the public officials in charge of making decisions on relaxing or tightening safety measures don't seem to care about the lived experience of patients and those who care for them. I feel for the overwhelmed doctors, nurses and other hospital staff. Perhaps Gov. Abbott needs to spend some time doing rounds at Houston hospitals."
2020-06-29 13:23,"We need more stories about young people being infected and hospitalized, its the only way you are going to get through to them. You have to show that it can happen to them, and that it can be very serious. I have a lot of friends who are carrying on like its no big deal. This past weekend a friend of mine turned 30 and his girlfriend threw him a party. I stopped out front to chat for a few minutes (6 feet away) and wish him well but there was no chance I am hanging out with other people like that this year."
2020-06-29 13:36,"We live in Harris County. We have been extremely careful. Social distancing, wearing masks, washing hands etc. (being old with underlying conditions). All these precautions may be for nothing. At grocery stores, big box stores (we rarely go). You still see more than usual number of people (young and old ), not wearing masks or not observing social distancing. Not surprised at the numbers spiking."
2020-06-29 14:46,"The term ""cowboy"" is associated with a fearless independence that borders on recklessness. Of all the states in the union, Texas is most notably associated with the cowboy. Few people have acted like cowboys; but more than enough have acted irresponsibly that the virus has take control, just like a bull at a rodeo. 

I suspect fewer than one in a thousand people actually get on a bull and try to ride it for more than seven seconds. Imagine the damage of twenty-five percent of the population riding the bull that is Covid-19 because they've bought into the myth of being cowboys -- like lots of toddlers by into the myth of playing ""house"".

Oh, wait, you don't have to imagine.

Written by an egghead, ivory tower, agnostic liberal from the northeast who has put his faith in science. Like Ms. Estrada, there is no guarantee that I won't succumb but, if I do, I know it won't be because I was arrogant enough to think I was stronger than the virus."
2020-06-29 14:49,Trump caused this and the Texas GOP governor demanding an open early despite new infections elsewhere.  Impeach both on crimes against humanity.
2020-06-29 14:33,What kind of country is this where minor inconvenience of wearing a mask is too much?  A combination of selfishness and ignorance is putting the healthcare workers at risk.  Why don't these people sign a waiver when they refuse to wear a mask and socially distance?
2020-06-29 14:43,"It goes without saying this was not only predictable but likely. Republicans have been tripping over each other to control the narrative to trick their constituency into believing that no matter what democrats say, they are wrong, though they aren't. They think putting some kind of illogical twist on things and ""sort of"" urging caution while creating the illusion that everything Anthony Fauci on down says is silly and overreactive. The republican obsession with reframing everything is, once again, causing death. These republican governors almost as much as said ""This is a black east coast problem (inferring it is the fault of East coast liberals  and ""those people.)"" Inferring their alleged superior moral standing will save them. All the more egregious because now right now Americans need to act in unity. It will be interesting to see how this continues to be parsed."
2020-06-29 14:32,"Heartbreaking.  

For this to be happening in a country with people so intelligent as to put a man on the moon seems inexplicable.  We are knowingly putting ourselves in harms way, completely ignoring science (to a great extent) by succumbing to the proclamations and examples of a gang of marauding parasites called the republicans, their propaganda wings (FOX, church, AM radio, paranoia web) and their three great pillars of support: supremacists, bible thumpers, and uneducated rurals.  The fourth pillar, suburban middle-class-to-rich whites, otherwise pretty sanguine about supremacists, are taking every precaution, thank you very much - on account of being educated and interested in self-preservation.

I am aware that a vast number of the people who have caught the virus were not engaging in irresponsible behaviors themselves, were likely performing very vital functions to help the rest of us, but succumbed to the highly irresponsible, un-civic behaviors of others.  

Truly heartbreaking."
2020-06-29 14:50,"To state the obvious this is a bad time to have a president who lies, divides and lacks common sense. That trump and his republicans still don't get that there's a correlation between improving the economy and managing the pandemic is exactly why we are where we are right now. He doesn't want to wear a mask.....ok, but why don't more people stand up to him? Why didn't Honeywell officials insist he wear one in their factory? Why did factory owners in Maine decide to throw away the swabs made that day instead of asking him to follow their rules? Why didn't Tulsa officials tell him no, the place for the rally isn't open until later in July? He's not up to the job of leading our country in a time of crisis but we have smart people around this country and everyone needs to do the what's necessary even if he doesn't.  Everyone needs to step up and speak up and leave trump and his republican enablers behind."
2020-06-29 14:42,"This pandemic, at the early stages, hit me with unusual (and mostly unwarranted, as we are relatively blessed in terms of having a steady income, comfortable place to live, and very good health) bouts of anxiety.
That has, for the most part, passed. Now I just feel uncomfortably, and pretty much uncharacteristically, angry a LOT of the time. There are a number of reasons, but the main one has to do with thinking like this:
“I thought younger folks are not going to get symptoms; if I do get it, it’s not going to be a big deal,” he said.
That was not true in his case. “It hit me like a truck,” he said. “Even if you are young and not at risk, it’s pretty scary.”
So NOW it becomes something ""scary""--when it affects you and the people you know. Before it was just a matter of telling older people to ""stay home if you don't like"" people running by others, maskless and without even bothering to create a little distance. Or the very young woman (MAYBE 20?) from Florida who called me a ""sheep"" last week for advocating mask use on Instagram, and told me that her expertise in epidemiology comes from having ""friends who are doctors and don't wear masks"" (Dr. Fauci, she assured me, doesn't know what he's talking about).
So much for ""All for one, and one for all."" It's become painfully clear that for a large part of this country an issue is only real if it affects people personally (or if Trump says it's real).
As a result, this thing will apparently go on for a really long time."
2020-06-29 14:37,Our ‘American Exceptionalism’ is revealing it’s true face.  If freedom is only a matter of individual choices then we will not have freedom as a random series of immature choices around much longer.  My parents always taught our large family “THINK OF OTHERS”. This is why the country is failing and in immanent danger.   Our needed solution is NEW LEADERSHIP. READY TO VOTE!
2020-06-29 14:37,"How can one have a family gathering and still be cautious?  For so many family members to get infected there must have been a lot of hugging and laughing out loud without masks.

We in NYC are still wearing our masks, even in the park."
2020-06-29 14:31,"I live in a suburb of Houston and have had intimate knowledge of the hospital system, having battled cancer, pneumonia, COPD and broken bones in the last several years, and have been treated at Methodist, St. Luke’s, Hermann and physicians associated with UT Med. Houston’s Medical Center is it’s own city within the city, a huge complex of facilities staffed with some of the most capable professionals in the world. It appalls me to know that even they are swamped with Coronavirus cases, some brought on by the bad decisions of our state leadership and the irresponsibility of citizens more concerned with bar-hopping and “constitutional right to personal freedoms” such as not wearing masks or practicing social distancing then spreading this pestilence. Our Republican “leadership” at both the state and federal levels seem intent on hamstringing local mayors and city officials in Texas from carrying out necessary efforts to fight this spread of disease in order to revive the economy, their main priority. I’m approaching my seventh decade, but I am not, as our wonderful lieutenant governor urged, willing to sacrifice myself to further the making of money."
2020-06-29 15:01,"If capacity is full, hospitals should prioritize patients due to method of infection.

Elderly patients who caught it from their caretakers at nursing homes through no fault of their own should get priority treatment. 

Young patients who were careless and got it through parties should be depriotized and left to fight the virus without oxygen or redmensivir if supplies are tight."
2020-06-29 14:53,"Apart from the enormous tolls of death and destruction one thing really stands out to me about this entire affair and that is the degree to which a sizeable portion of the country will tie themselves into any manner of knot to avoid taking the advice of experts.

There are so many folks who believe that they can sit at home with a spreadsheet and do a better job of estimating the deadliness of this pandemic, or the capacity of the hospital system than medical researchers or hospital administrators can. Most don't even know enough about the sophistication of the problems they're claiming to analyze that they can even ask the right questions, never mind drawing a sound conclusion.

Whether or not this is a problem simply caused by the Internet making so much data accessible, this type of deep cynicism about authority and expertise is at the foundation of so many of the bad decisions made by the citizens of the United States at present.

The truly frightening thing is that the even when the pandemic ends, this undercurrent of DIY analytics and skepticism of authority will make handling the next one every bit as hard, if not unimaginably harder."
2020-06-29 15:10,"This transcends inept leadership. It really seems as if our corrupt leaders opened up the country and lied about the risks so that some of their wealthy, elite supporters could line their pockets once again. They have deliberately sacrificed the lives and health of low income, middle class and black and brown people. Unfortunately too many of our fellow citizens, the very ones being exploited and killed for the financial gain of others, were all too willing to ignore the warnings of scientists and statisticians. They didn't care or believe when NYC was being ravaged by covid. It is painful to see that they learned nothing from us. And now they will pull the whole country down with them, economically and in terms of health and safety."
2020-06-29 15:12,"Everyone who dismisses Covid-19 because it is hardest on the elderly and ill, or because it does not kill most people, is just plain dumb.  As long as Covid is in the US and we don't have a reliable and accessible vaccine, there will be LOTS of ""exceptions"" (i.e., younger patients, ""healthy"" patients, and patients who thought they weren't at high risk).  And how dare so many blithely dismiss the deaths of thousands of their fellow citizens--elderly or otherwise.  And don't think surviving Covid is the end of the story.  My brother has permanent deafness is one ear, very impaired hearing in the other, and chronic blood clots as one of the lucky survivors.  I'll say it again: Keep your distance and wear a mask to protect others, regardless of how invincible you want to believe yourself to be."
2020-06-29 15:15,"In the comments people blame selfishness for the kind of behavior that has caused a rise in virus cases. That is definitely part of it, but there is another side to consider.
Fear can cause people to act illogically. When a person is unable to bear a situation, they can go into a state of denial. Extreme denial can prompt defiance as a way to negate an unpleasant reality. In essence, people desperately want everything to be back to normal, so they pretend it is."
2020-06-29 15:05,"Perhaps what medical professionals need to emphasize, is not simply wearing a mask, but every-time you are in a public, contact situation, the outside of your mask is more contaminated than the inside. Every-time you pull out your mask, your hand touches the outside and possibly the inside layers. The longer you re-wear a mask, the more potential contamination. What's worse is that you now keep contamination close to your nose and inhale it constantly. Please buy washable cloth masks or disposable masks. Best to wear clean masks each time you go out. Be aware of how you store or re-wear your mask."
2020-06-29 15:16,"It breaks my heart to keep reading about these ""healthy"" people ""with no underlying conditions"" suffering grave complications from the virus. The current American diet and lifestyle IS an underlying condition, especially the diet. Through no fault of their own, most of these younger Americans aren't healthy, they're subclinically ill: they eat a highly inflammatory, nutrient-poor diet that compromises their immune system and metabolic health, creating vulnerabilities this virus naturally exploits. Their body hasn't yet been ravaged enough to manifest as clinically ill *every day* - with prediabetes, hypertension, whatever - but they're well on their way there, and the proof is in the pudding, or the ICU. 

I think of one of Michael Greger's favorite studies, from 1960, that looked at the rate of incipient heart disease in young people using autopsy findings from people who died from causes other than strokes or heart attacks. The study looked at age-matched groups from St Louis and Uganda, and found 136 cases of myocardial infarction in 632 Missourians ... and ONE case of myocardial infarction in 632 Ugandans. (And these people died in the 50s, when the American diet was nowhere near as deadly as it is now!) Few of those 632 Missourians would've been classified as ""unhealthy"" on any cardiac test we have today - it took autopsies to find the minor infarcts - but they were well on their way to heart disease. Same story today, with a sadder and more abrupt ending."
2020-06-29 15:17,"Unless people and patients cooperate with the medical team, say doctors and  nurses, it is very difficult to fight this bloody virus. People should appreciate the medical  fraternity, as they risk their own lives and try to save the virus affected. They do not want clapping of hands or garlands, but a mere cooperation from the patients. That is all. If they get that cooperation, soon things would be better."

My teenagers have only seen their friends outside, with masks and 6 ft apart, even though many parents are allowing their kids to have large parties and gatherings with no masks. Many people in Boston think the virus is done here, including the protesters, as I see fewer and fewer masks.

I have zero sympathy for TX patients who thought the virus wasn’t their problem or wouldn’t affect them. And now their stupidity is going to take us all down.

Wake up people! This isn’t just about you."
2020-06-29 15:44,"I am so angry these days. I cannot help it anymore. My family of four—husband and two young adult sons—prepared early, took the virus seriously, and, when the first shutdown occurred, we stayed home. 

During the shutdown the economy/oil collapse happened. Husband was immediately placed on furlough—until January 2021. One son was laid off from his job in west TX, losing his health insurance at the same time. The other son was called back to work in a restaurant in Austin after only 28 days when Abbott decided the economy was more important than lives...my son, no shirker, was afraid to go and is still very concerned about the risks, but had no choice: it was either work, or lose his apartment and his health insurance. So he’s in a packed kitchen, masks notwithstanding, making vegan food for people who would rather have their cold-press coffee in public than stay home. 

So three of us are still under one roof, still sheltering in place and doing curbside grocery orders, still watching Texas burn while worrying about paying all our bills for the next six months. One of us has no insurance and one is working just to keep his, and will possibly—God forbid—need it *because* he has to work. 

This is what happens when the response to a deadly virus is politicized/weaponized and you’re unlucky enough to live in a red state. We have the worst imaginable „leadership” at the worst imaginable time...and we’re powerless."

If masking protocols had simply been issued and if everyone at the top had done their jobs to help protect American lives as well as the economy, right from the get go.

2020-06-29 15:55,"I finished my residency a year ago in Houston, not at Houston Methodist, and obviously before COVID-19 existed.  

The increasing cases in Texas is no surprise to me.  I have never met people so cavalier with regards to the well being of others (particularly strangers) and the big societal picture.  Whether it was the environment, public transportation, urban design, taxes, healthcare, etc, political decisions came down to one factor... ""The individual"".   Compared to other states I have lived in, for many Texans there is no greater good.  Rather, the most important thing is their in-group, their large truck and their house in the suburbs.  

In so many ways, this outlook backfires on them.  I could go on and on about the crippling traffic jams in their urban sprawl, the pollution that induced hacking attacks in mostly everyone, the lack of foresight that lead to the flooding in Hurricane Harvey. 

So, it is no surprise to me that Texans chose partying in Galveston over the lives of others.  To many in that state, the virus does not exist, until it affects them.  Short term pleasures are more important that temporary burdens, even if it means saving lives.  I am so happy to have moved from there."

Here in the sunny Portuguese south, many people are becoming complacent in the main holiday season. Government ministers talk for hours on the tv, mostly self congratulating, taking credit for the low death rate (so far!). Along the road there are billboards announcing how great we all are fighting covid in some imaginary club. I see people driving alone and wearing masks. In my opinion what we really need is lots of public information to advise people on how to avoid covid on a day to day basis, hygiene that sort of thing."

Still to be noted that If she took off her mask while there, she put herself at risk as well as her colleagues and the young patients. She may have been at work while pre-symptomatic and been a vector for transmission.  What is the contagious disease training for staff at that clinic ?    To the young man who wore the masks for days, it is not a matter of luck but likely that the mask got contaminated at some point and that the virus was passed through touching the mask and his face.  That is the importance of understanding the how and the why, and the importance of having enough safety supplies provided by employers for their contractors and employees."
2020-06-29 16:50,"I live in Harris County, and also work for one of the hospitals in Texas Medical Center. I find it interesting that recent communications from hospital CEOs have been about available capacity or the ability to convert beds into ICU beds to stay open. Sure, a couple thousand beds can be ""opened"" up, but that does not address the finite number of respiratory therapists, ICU-trained nurses, and ICU-trained doctors to provide ICU level of care. Seems like an important factor to consider."
2020-06-29 16:50,"Yes, we call our on our doctors and nurses to work overtime, more shifts in in creakingly dangerous situations.  Then when the pandemic slackens off, hospitals need to fire or ""let go"" nurses, techs and a multitude of hospital workers and reduce the pay of hospitalists and other hospital employed specialists.  This is how we repay the ""heroes"". We thank them with card board hand made thank you signs.  then the next wave comes and we want them to risk their lives again.  Where was the emergency monies for hospitals that never seemed to materialize?  I would not blame our medical personnel if they thumbed their Moses at the rest of us and told us to take care of ourselves.

Some things cannot be changed .
So may be focus on the power of the nudge since saying “ do as I say because it will work “ brings out inherent resistance . So what it may require is :
 A marketing nudge : make it the cool thing to do : the societal thing to do : it’s what the socially responsible thing to do ...
May be convince the major brands to do a group marketing campaign ( after we convince them that it help their brand as being socially responsible )
With this age group : life experience is lacking .
The more you tell them NOT to do it .. it’s alway s a uphill battle ::: “ I will do it the opposite way “

2020-06-29 16:12,"I'm sorry for those people in the article.  I applaud their bravery for having their stories told and their names used.  I'm not happy that they got ill and I hope they recover quickly. 

We all know that the elderly were at higher risk of getting sick with the virus.  What many Americans fail to articulate is that the elderly are at risk not because they are old but because there is a higher prevalence of ill health and pre-existing health issues for this demographic.  It's not an age issue so much as it is a health issue.  If you have health issues - you are at risk!    

Speaking of which.  By definition an obese person is an at-risk person in terms of health.  Ergo if you are obese don't think you are healthy!  Each and every patient in the pictures in this article seemed at risk in terms of health; they appeared either overweight or obese.  And it's no surprise since we all know that the US has an obesity epidemic that it is ignoring.   

CDC stats:  
""The prevalence of obesity was 40.0% among young adults aged 20 to 39 years, 44.8% among middle-aged adults aged 40 to 59 years, and 42.8% among older adults aged 60 and older"" 

4 months ago my friends and I predicted that the US would lead the world in Covid deaths - not because your population is aged, but because 40% of Americans are obese and a further 25% overweight.  It was clear as day to us.  Why you didn't take more precautions to guard against Covid, given your ill health, mind blowing."
2020-06-29 16:23,"Masks work when everyone is wearing them and the viral load is low. If some people are not wearing masks and the rate of infection is high, masks are less effective.

They opened too fast. They failed to order masks. They failed to implement testing and tracing. They failed to ramp up PPE, capacity and test supplies. They failed to assure that community spread was low. 

Texas policy has killed people did not have to die. This is a massive failure of trust."
2020-06-29 16:58,"I wince to read Dr. Faisal Masud’s comment that “the most severely ill young people often are obese or have medical problems such as diabetes, kidney disease and high blood pressure.” Perhaps “often,” but surely not always — and by stating this qualification, he’s enabling still more young people to believe that they are safe from COVID-19 if they don’t have underlying conditions. 

We need doctors and medical professionals to continue emphasizing how universally vulnerable we are now, not announcing exceptions. People are already telling themselves that they’re safe, and look what has happened."
2020-06-29 17:09,"I hope articles like this about people who didn’t even know how they contracted the virus will help others take this thing more seriously. WEAR. A. MASK. especially when indoors in close, prolonged proximity to others. 

I’m really worried, however, about the toll it is taking on the health care workers, with the never ending onslaught of new patients and no end in sight. Even if they manage not to get the virus, the toll on their mental health is going to be long term and devastating.

However, last week we had an experience with a younger man that really scared us. He was physically large and was wearing a mask, but had it pulled down, so that it did not cover his nose and mouth.  He engaged by making a superficially pleasant comment, and then purposefully invaded our space in a provacative manner and and would not back off.

It aggravates him to no end that every major city in Texas is governed by a Democratic mayor. So like Trump who feels the need to dismantle any good legacy left behind by his predecessor simply because he’s a Democrat (see Obamacare) Abbott has also decided to intrude and override every city ordinance put in place to combat this virus by Democratic mayors. The mayors of all the largest cities in Texas have sent letters pleading the governor to let them handle the situation in their cities or to at least let them to institute mask wearing ordinances, but to no avail.

A true leader however loyal he is to the party, s/he deeply cares about the citizens, follows specialists/doctors/ scientists and makes pragmatic choice.

This is a major, major risk factor and regardless of the ""PC-ness"" of talking about body acceptance, it must be acknowledge that being overweight/obese is a significant health problem in light of the coronavirus. 

42% of America is obese. This factor alone needs to be accounted for in our response to the disease, and young overweight/obese people who haven't previously had any related health problems, NEED to consider themselves an at-risk population, or else you may very likely end up in the ICU. We also need more data that shows age and BMI correlation with COVID-19 outcomes for the public to be fully aware of this.

2020-06-29 20:41,"Why the breathless reporting? Why can't we have more complete numbers that tell the actual story?
- The cumulative total of people who have tested positive is irrelevant as it includes resolved, asymptomatic, and mild cases -- about 96% of the total. The only relevant numbers are new hospitalizations and new deaths.
- Show us the age range (i.e., 21-30, 31-40...80-90) of those being hospitalized and dying.
- Show us the underlying illness (i.e., obesity, heart disease, diabetes) of those who are being hospitalized and 
 dying.

What you'll find is consistent with results seen around the world: nearly 100% of people hospitalized and dying are over 75 and/or have an underlying illness. 

Therefore, if you are young and without an underlying illness, it is a likely good thing to get the virus as you will likely be asymptomatic or have mild or flu-like conditions -- and then become immune from a second wave.

The message is this: if you are over 75 or have an underlying illness, then be appropriately cautious. If you live with someone over 75 or who has an underlying illness, be appropriately cautious. For the rest of the population, be respectful, but carry on."

The presumption (arrogance?) of the young is that if they get infected with Covid they will have a ""mild"" case at worst and will recover rather than die unlike some older victim.

But we have no idea at this point what long term disabilities may result for younger victims of this respiratory disease.  Indeed, they may find that they will go though the rest of their lives with reduced lung capacity and respiratory co-morbidities.

I don't know if this is the case -- but I wouldn't be at all surprised if there are longer-term negative effects to respiratory systems undergoing such stress.

They most likely got it at a restaurant, a beach, or a similar public place. Or maybe at work.

Abbott opened up these places simply to make people to go back to work.  If you feared for your health, then you quit. This would reduce their unemployment rate and the state would not have to have to pay out large sums of unemployment benefits.

Obviously a family dinner is probably not as risky as sitting in a crowded bar but it is sustained, one-on-one contact without a mask, and much riskier if held indoors. We need loud and clear harm reduction methods! If you *must* see your family, please wear masks and meet up outside, at a distance. Dr. Fauci has said multiple times that mask + distance is the safest combo when you must go out. And for the love of all things holy- wash your masks and keep them on when you are within 6 feet of anyone outside your home, especially if you work in a healthcare setting. If my child has received dialysis at the clinic where the woman couldn't keep her mask on, I would be enraged!

Still so much mystery around this virus. It's more than just the stated comorbidities (obesity, heart disease, lung disease, diabetes, etc.) that put one at greater risk.

If you have managers who are comfortable managing remote workers, and employees who enjoy and value the experience and this can be very successful, extremely successful. If you have managers struggling with the lack of control and techniques to stay engaged, or workers to take advantage of it, then of course it doesn’t work well.

You should update this article.  Call me or get some other experts and get a balanced view of this topic rather than arbitrarily saying it’s the best thing since sliced bread or it will never work. Both extremes are wrong.

A ton of companies - many, unsurprisingly, in tech - were allowing their professional employees to work from home; it certainly seemed like the beginning of a new work paradigm......until it stopped. Sort of unceremoniously and quietly, but the trend reversed pretty significantly. In my experience, I knew more people who worked from home (including myself) a dozen years ago than I did two years ago. Probably for the reasons listed in the article.

Another reason why I put little credence on the ""the pandemic will change X forever"" genre of articles. My guess is everything pretty much goes back to the way things were in a couple of years when we've got this virus beat."

She was fine of course, bailing out with a golden parachute once the company had been destroyed. 

The story she gave for the no-remote decision, which the writer dutifully and unskeptically repeats here, was obvious nonsense. Insiders at the company posted that the real problem was that when she took over she drove into the parking lot and saw too few cars, then discovered that they had employees working remotely for years and had no idea if they were actually doing anything. 

I'm sorry but if you have no idea whether employees are producing anything or not, how is this not a management problem? 

This is the nub of this whole issue. Not having any way to measure whether people are producing any work is a management problem. By forcing everyone to work onsite every day you might think you've solved it, but all you've done then is assured yourself that everyone is working hard because you can see them doing so. As David Graeber documents in great detail in his book about jobs, people appearing to produce at work but actually doing almost nothing all day is so common as to be epidemic. 

For companies that understand remote work, it works wonderfully. It's those who don't understand it that fail at it."

Or for those with a home office, fully fund the cost of running a remote office? Or contribute to employee's residential conversion to solar power?  Incremental WFH electricity demand may seem a small issue but it's potentially huge at scale for a distrbuted workforce."
2020-06-29 13:45,"Based on my observation of ""work"" performed by corporate types is that most of it is meaningless as far as productivity goes. Most of it was managers running around trying to act important, having meetings where nothing was accomplished and no changes were made, and the C-suite people doing even less. 

There was a lot of brown-nosing and political shuffling with the lowest paid people doing the hard yards, making sales, answering tech support, fixing equipment, etc. with the higher ups claiming the credit. 

Most of the time the janitors had better management skills and work ethics and would have done a better job running the companies.

I worked remotely for nearly 15 years for one of the companies mentioned in this article. I never spoke with anyone during that time who complained about working remotely. If they wanted a cubicle, they could have it. Very few did. On the contrary my colleagues had one consistent message: we were far more productive at home than the office. When the company changed their telecommute policy, many top performers left. This is a significant factor in how many people choose their employer.  I would not work for a company with no telecommute privileges, nor would many others I know. When companies reverse telecommuting policies it is generally down to a management structure that feels out of control (which of these companies mentioned turned themselves around due to eliminating telecommuting.... ?

The only thing I would have changed about my situation is that I would have liked to be on staff and get benefits and promotions and a little job security all these years--I have not had a paid vacation since 1988 and have no love for the so-called gig economy. But I have been very excited (and not the least surprised) to see how many companies are finally talking about letting their employees (as opposed to their contract workers) work from home. I hope they won't be deterred by the imperfect models of the past, or treat employees like children who can't be trusted. There is so much to be gained--just think of the drop in air pollution from all the commuter cars and buses that won't be on the roads. Think of all the work-life conflicts families, and especially women, will be spared. It is time for managers to put their money where their mouths are--think outside the box of office space and give working at home a honest try on a grand scale."
2020-06-29 14:09,"I agree with other reader comments that it’s simplistic to state that the future of “work from home” is destined to fail. 

Besides any analysis of productivity, employee satisfaction, etc. there must also be consideration of the huge ripple effect this has on society, the economy, and the environment.  Changes in family dynamics, a drop in use of commercial office space and mass transit, a shift in energy consumption, a benefit to slowing global warming, to name a few.  

Taken as a whole, the complexities and potential benefits and costs of such a wide-scale shift in labor are fascinating when considering how they are far-reaching."

Or veterans being introduced to new people and vice versa.  Or being able to observe personal interactions and read the room.  The work will always get done, but people are social beings and face to face interactions, even if limited to once a quarter,  is necessary to personal and professional growth and development."
2020-06-29 14:12,"I don’t think the late-night talk show hosts, for example, think working from home should be permanent.  They’re doing their best, but the shows look cheesy and the hosts look tired  — and need haircuts.  Remote work may be good for a very few all the time, okay for many some of the time, but permanent for all none of the time."
2020-06-29 14:15,"While IBM blamed work from home for its missteps in the early years of this century and recalled employees to the office, most of those employees saw different mechanisms at work.  The failures to identify and take advantage of trends in the industry was more due to the leadership model that focused on financial metrics rather than investing in key employees and technologies rather than work from home.  The push back to the office coincided with further rounds of layoffs as bad bets unwound and were divested and the company leadership had the misguided notion that sandwiching employees shoulder to shoulder would allow them to duplicate the magic of silicon valley start ups.  

Work from home is something that clearly can work for employees and for companies.  Cherry-picking examples of reversals misses the impact of this trend in this century.  This will be one case where those who learn how to effectively work from home will thrive - whether companies that learn how to manage it or employees who learn how to do it."
2020-06-29 14:18,"It is possible to work well from home, but you must have an appropriate space and an ingrained work ethic.

I've worked successfully from home and I've also experienced an unsuccessful instance when there were too many distractions.

It's up to the employee to ensure they're able to work effectively from a remote location.  It's also not an invitation to avoid work of play around on work time."
2020-06-29 14:21,"I don't miss my 2+ hours daily subway commute. I see a lot more of the day and evening working from home. However, having this forced on me in a 2 room apartment I share with a 14 yo, it's had a terrible impact on our home, the ambience of what home is supposed to be, how we get to use our limited space, the times when I am and am not available to work. My employer has been setting the rules. Since the tools of my job are within reach of where I have breakfast on Sunday mornings they seem to think it 's ok to ask me to work at breakfast time on Sunday. Recently I asked my employer for 3 hrs off to attend an activity with my teenager. I was told it was very short notice. I replied that I had responded night & day 7 days/week at short notice to work demands . Not amused. No one from HR has asked us what our feelings are as employees about working from home. No one has asked us about the impediments, only the abilitiy. I've been told older children don't need supervision, so a parent of an ""older child"" should be available thoughout the day, doesn't need a flexible schedule, etc. 
I'm paying more in food, in coffee, I've had to buy surge protectors and extension cords, get a desk. I've resisted A/C for years due to the cost of running it, but working at home at the height of summer heat and humidity is going to be a challenge. 
As an employee, I'd say there are many downsides to working from home, primarily my autonomy over myself,  my family and my personal space is gone."
2020-06-29 14:21,"Successful remote work in any collaborative endeavor involves learning many new and subtle skills. Enlightened executives with empathy and humility recognize this, and incorporate regular ongoing training of effective remote work practices as one element of a flexible and diverse workplace. A real business leader looks at remote work in this way, not as a shortcut to gin up profits in hard times.

But it seems that nothing can overcome the cognitive bias of illusory superiority that characterizes the several executives quoted in this article. The inability of business leaders to recognize and appreciate the contributions of their colleagues when they are unable to see them at their desks is a plain example of how they are crippled by their self-delusory pride.

But pride goeth before a fall..."
2020-06-29 14:22,"I find these type of articles problematic often. What type of work are we talking about? Data entry or actual policy discussions or what?

To me I see it this way, if your work is quantifiable, work from the distance and produce a tangible results. You do not even need a manager. Standardize the result, and either you meet that or you are gone! and I do not care how long it takes you or when you work at it. Produce standard results!

If the work is qualitative, then it is no brainy, that you may need some textual contact and creativity which you may not get all the time in 2D Zoom meeting. 

So it really depends on the work and without qualifying what work, it is just noise discussion without meaning."
2020-06-29 14:26,"It really depends on the person. I've been a remote employee for years and early on I learned the value of always responding immediately during working hours.My boss even once commented that I was easier to find than some people in the office. 
On the flip side, some people love office life a little too much - the ones always wandering around chatting, in the kitchen 5x a day or going out continuously be it for breakfast, lunch, ""a little walk"", or a smoke break. I actually find it difficult to work when I go into the office now because I feel like I'm constantly getting interrupted. 
Anyway, I suspect the PR exec is right - people will slowly gravitate back to the office. Maybe some will stay home, but not all, or maybe even most. I think in general we are overstating this ""new normal"" thing. In most spheres of life, what will probably end up being a 1-2-year crisis isn't going to end decades/centuries of habit."
2020-06-29 14:29,"It will be interesting to see how certain companies reconcile their desire to be leaders while still grasping onto the old-fashioned office-work model. Public corporations often maximize shareholder value add at the expense of employees. The remote-work revolution is an opportunity for corporations to improve their employee's quality of life AND save money (given less office space is needed). For those who want to go to an office, that's fine. For those who prefer to work remotely, it is insulting to suggest that we are unable to do our jobs effectively without direct supervision in an office."
2020-06-29 14:29,"Zoom and its analogs have been a game changer as are personal phones and people's acceptance of work email etc at home. So spinning back  to 2004 to say something will not work in the future is like looking back to the Dark Ages.  The virus has had us run a massive natural experiment so we know it does work today, even if it didn't in the olde tymes.

There are always naysayers - I can remember board level meetings about whether the Internet was going to catch on or just fizzle as a nerd's toy.

There is every likelihood though, that along with redundant office space, middle level management will get culled. Some of these 'empire builders' measure their value to the company by how many bodies they have on their floor. And they were the same guys who blocked working from home previously."
2020-06-29 14:30,"The author forgets the benefit to the environment when workers all over the country stop commuting or go to the office only occasionally.  Given the climate emergency, we must find ways to lower our carbon footprints, and this looks like a method that could work for many people.     (I worked from home for many years and appreciated being able to do so.)"
2020-06-29 14:30,"Although I enjoy working from home, what is missing are the important social dynamics of the workplace. The everyday  niceties, the body language, and eye contact that can help smooth over the fabric of work life are missing. Much of that is lost on Zoom and emails, which create a firewall to daily human contact.  This can contribute to misunderstandings and resentments. No workplace is the same as another, but physical distancing is already teaching us some valuable. lessons about working from home."
2020-06-29 14:36,"I think it depends on the company, and how they setup remote work. Even before the pandemic, I was working from home twice per week, and since switching to remote work full time, our productivity has actually increased. One thing my employer did was require employees to be available between 9 and 3 PM. It's only a six hour window, but it's extremely effective at keeping people at their desks. During that time, employees must be available to answer emails and IMs. We also hold daily stand-ups with our teams over a video chat where we explain what we have been working on, and what we will be working on."
2020-06-29 14:40,"I worked for several years for a global company - my team was all over the world so most of us worked remotely. I loved being able to go the gym early in the  morning instead of having to commute, and it was great being able to schedule deliveries, etc. during the work day.

Here’s what I observed: Working at home means you never leave the office. You feel  compelled to check your phone - and it pings at all hours. 

There was not a lot of respect for work-life balance. People who sent out emails at 3 am were often praised for their diligence. We were given generous vacation time, but many worked throughout their vacations because your “office” was portable, and we were driven by performance reviews which determined your bonus and pay raise. And we had such workloads that it would be very obvious who was slacking off. 

Working remotely is a great option  - with proper training and guidelines in place, for example, you still need a babysitter for young children. Social etiquette on phone calls and emails is a must for those whose communication style comes across as too blunt. It’s easier to make offhand remarks (or to interpret them as such) via an email or conference call, whereas when you are face to face you cannot hide behind a computer."
2020-06-29 14:40,"I've been teaching graduate classes at a university sixty miles from my home for a long time. For the past four years, our graduate program has been 100% online. I have a beautiful office on campus and in regular times visit campus once a week. I miss seeing colleagues and friends and franky seeing the beautiful 'bricks and mortar'. Looking forward to returning to campus in the fall--I hope. The university-wide breakfast and the latest from the President ---of course accompanied by live Bluegrass. Student interaction with online teacching is immediate and stimulating."
2020-06-29 14:42,"So this is the 'brave new world'.  Isolation.  People are not just work animals they are social beings too.  You cannot judge success by how well it works for 3 or 4 months, but in 3 or 4 years.  I cannot imagine being trapped in my home all day and night with spyware watching me.  Work accomplishments may stay the same but I bet people won't in the  long run.  Also I imagine those at the top will still reward themselves handsomely but there will be the danger of workers becoming part of the gig economy.  Great for the bottom line but not for workers.  There are reasons people are moving back to cities; they're exciting places to be.  I know many students hate working from home, ""it su... said one of them"".  Why do I care I""m retired, but I work at a camp for teenagers in Maine and I know why they come to camp, not to become  better tennis players or potters but to find friends and make lifelong social connections.  A warm greeting in the morning means something.  Screens are very cold."
2020-06-29 14:43,"I’ve been a remote worker for five years and have found the last few months have made it easier to interact with my colleagues, who seem much happier. We are all on the same playing field now and they make more of an effort to include my company’s remote workers in Happy hours, which are now by zoom. I do hope it stays this way."
2020-06-29 14:43,"As many have said here, being unable to identify whether and how work gets done is a management problem. The responsibility to get with the program lies with managers, and employees shouldn’t have to add “teaching you to manage me remotely” to their list of responsibilities. Forcing employees who have been enjoying and doing a good job working from home to return is a prescription in the short term for spreading the pandemic even further. In the long run, it augurs mass disgruntlement and an exodus of talent to firms with dynamic management that recognizes that the world has radically changed. I have lost weight, planted a garden and reconnected with my local community in the time I would have been commuting or simply making unnecessary face time, all while managing a massive regulatory project quite successfully. I know next time I’m on the labor market I’ll have one take it or leave it requirement: working remotely."
2020-06-29 14:49,"I feel like I've written this same post a number of times of late. Working form home CAN be done, and without either party going nuts, becoming a hermit... or losing productivity. 

I've worked from home for 18 years now; while I'm a small business owner that owns a small design firm (so I may be an outlier ""unicorn""), our clients are global corporations with offices all over the world.

I've worked with one of our largest clients for that 18 years span, with contract renewals every 5, designing packaging that's seen globally. I meet with them via telepresence from my home office, connecting for meetings with people in China, India, Russia, the EU, and the US. 

I personally work more efficiently from home, since I don't have the usual office distractions of ""the slacker/goof-off"", ""the gossip"", or the ""How do you do that thing you showed me how to do yesterday again?"". As for human contact, I'm on the phone with my corporate liaison almost every day, so I'm not lacking for conversation.

This ability to focus on the work means that I work faster, and can charge my clients less than what they're charged by the massive design firms they work with. In fact, I fix the errors that those ""premium"" design firms make... all the time.

Don't get me wrong, I'm social, and I like being around people; but past in-office work has shown me that many folks just want to do the bare minimum and phone it all in, while expecting others to pick up the slack (which was me as art director)."
2020-06-29 14:49,"Probably be the death knell of company loyalty.  Every year companies spend huge amounts of money to attract and retain talent.  I've been to countless events aimed at indoctrinating a ""company culture"" and ""team building"".  These efforts to stand out as an employer of choice are not going to work when everyone is isolated at home.  I can see the time I get an email telling me my top employee is resigning.  I'll try to lure them back and they'll respond they've already been working at the other company for a month and me counter offer is in vain."
2020-06-29 14:50,"Does it have to be all or nothing? It's surprising that so many companies seem to have gone all-in on remote work so quickly. 

Working from home suits some people (and some companies) very well. Some tasks are best done remotely. I've had the ability to work from home for most of my career and I think it's been great for me to have uninterrupted head-down time for any high intensity task. I have organized my project teams this way for a long time with great results.

But we always used to conduct in-person meetings, and I miss those. Remote meetings have been noticeably worse for my teams. In Boston, housing is expensive. Not everyone has the space to set up a dedicated, quiet ""zoom room"" in their home, especially if there's more than one person at home doing work, and I think there are obvious problems with that being a requirement of employment.

I hope that a post-Covid workplace and work practices will simply incorporate the best parts of both systems. People should be encouraged to work from home especially if they're more productive that way. Good managers ought to know what their teams are up to no matter where they're working. Offices could function more as check-in locations or community hubs. Personally, I think open plan offices are horrible for productivity, and if Covid ends that practice, that seems great to me."
2020-06-29 14:53,"I have worked for several decades at a government agency that starts with the letter “N” in a very high-tech environment. I have always enjoyed how those that are not innovative taut that “innovative ideas” come from random people meeting at the water cooler or in the cafeteria and discussing work. Perhaps one in one thousand might, but innovation comes from being in an environment where you can decide to be not interrupted and can follow an idea with concentrated study and focused research. My experience is that people at the water cooler or cafeteria want to eat, decompress, and get ready for the activates required to round out the rest of the work day, and consider it rude when one constantly talks about work in a non-working environment."
2020-06-29 14:55,"I worked from home for 15 years.  I enjoyed and valued the experience.  There was extensive telephone interaction with my direct reports and other team mates across the network every day - so I was not lonely and made several friends in other cities and provinces that I have never met in person.  

The secret to working at home is to have a proper dedicated office with the necessary support - computer and broadband of course - but also scanner, fax, shredder and quality printer.  I made sure that I was in my office with a proper work attitude during business hours every day.  Unless I was on the phone, I could always be reached by callers.  Working at home doesn't work for those who approach their day with the intent to incorporate non-business activities.  

The elimination of commuting was a valuable perk for me - both because of the time saved and also the reduction in associated expenses.  

If companies have experienced bad results from working at home in the past, the fault lies with improperly setting out the rules and expectations as well as inadequate supervision and monitoring.  The concept itself, when executed properly, works very well."
2020-06-29 14:55,"My company allowed for one day a week of smart work. It required no specific availability time and it offered plenty of freedom. It's been my most productive day of the week ever since the smart working experiment began a few years ago. 
Since late February my colleagues and I are working remotely due to the lockdown. Even now that the restrictions are gone, we're still remote and we will be till September.
I hear a lot of people and colleagues complaining about remote working and I understand their reasons:kids require attention as schools and kindergarden are closed, the apartment/house is not as functional as the office, and of course missing the social aspects of a working environment. Overworking is another aspect, but the people complaining about it are the same people that stayed long time at the office before. You need to develop the ability to say ""no"" imho, remote working doesn't matter.
Remote working doesn't necessarily mean to be from home. Beside the option of travelling and staying home, there's also the option of co-working spaces close to where you live: the social nuances of the office can happen with neighbours and continue after working hours as well... you're likely living close to each other. Decentralized working spaces can also help local communities to thrive."
2020-06-29 14:56,I have been working at home for years and been able to meet an ever increasing workload. I am more productive at home than in some hellish open office pit. I do miss the days of having an actual office where I could work in quiet or have get together with colleagues. But the days of actual offices are long gone.
2020-06-29 14:59,"This is a particularly short sighted article, given the backlash experienced by Yahoo and IBM after they recalled their remote workers.  Working from home has changed due to technology and communication improvements, particularly in the last five years and specifically during the current pandemic.  Every weekend is NOT a three day holiday."
2020-06-29 14:59,"I'm someone who has always felt more productive in the office than at home. That said, months later, I know it's doable. My biggest concern would be the challenge - maybe impossible - of ever leaving to another company where I would be supervising a team of people I'd never met in person. Perhaps this will seem less problematic the more we become accustomed to interacting exclusively via cameras.

The very biggest benefit of WFH, which I don't see covered enough, is the effect it would have on affordable housing. At a time when cities like New York, San Francisco and Seattle home to major employers are so expensive that even a six-figure income can't guarantee being able to purchase a home, full-time remote working would allow people to live a few hours away full-time, alleviating one of the greatest burdens on this generation of workers."
2020-06-29 15:01,"I think our time will be remembered as when we said ""everything that's measured gets improved"" and then proceeded to apply half-baked, crude metrics to everything.  Executives are responsible for defining success, including remote work.  Most are incapable of it.  Companies need to invest more into defining the working process, culture, and ""how to do well here"" in a very specific way, which is often idiosyncratic.  Most executives just do a 2-3 year stint somewhere, buy back some shares, and then move on and do it again.  Very little thought put into long-game things like this."
2020-06-29 15:08,"I’m wondering who pays to set up a full time home office. You need an ergonomic workspace, storage & printer space, adequate hardware, good cyber security, good ventilation/AC (someone here mentions needing AC in their apartment for the first time,) etc. I’m guessing it’ll be the employee. Employees might even need to pay more rent in order to have a decently sized area to work in.

This will be part of the “one size fits all” or “if you have a hammer...” bottom-line logic of total, permanent isolation for the workforce. It’s amusing that the immediately preceding “hammer” was tiny shoulder-to-shoulder personal spaces on long tables in open offices, regardless of"

Given that many companies will be WFH for the foreseeable future, I'm curious to learn from from the ones that have found success with it."
2020-06-29 15:09,"I worked from home with HP for years. It requires setting goals, and active management. For many tasks, managers found out that employees were working longer hours, not less. In my situation the team was scattered across the globe. We met face to face two to four times each year. Personally, I sense there are lots of managers at all levels who simply do not have a clue how to hire, manage, motivate and reward work such that you can retain and grow good workers and max your productivity - in that situation remote work indeed is risky."
2020-06-29 15:11,"There are millions of people out of work because the work from home crowd finds it more convenient to stay there. It’s a variation of the “Me Too” movement. How many small businesses have been crushed because the millenials and others aren’t there to support the restaurants and small retail that depend on that foot traffic. It is not about me but we. Once the virus passes, we need to remember that."
2020-06-29 15:14,"I’m curious there is no discussion how WFH puts added demands on families. I’m sure I’m not alone here- our NYC apartment is neither large enough nor designed for WFH. We have had to retro-fit our dining table, purchase equipment and, until a desk could be delivered, ate our meals standing in the galley kitchen. The kids and I are confined to our bedrooms so as not to distract from the work environment and No, I will not make you a sandwich."
2020-06-29 15:15,"The technology has improved so much that we now have very high quality video conferencing and collaboration software (if you have good internet speeds).  This enables us to bring together many more people to work together.  This wasn't the case not that long ago.

The big issue is managers being able to orchestrate a truly diverse and widespread team toward the business objective of the team.

B-schools take note - this is going to make or break managers going forward.  Teach them well or else write case studies on the failures that will litter the economy."
2020-06-29 15:15,"Some work needs people presence, but much work in the digital age needs only a computer and internet service, and a place to sit.

This is less about where the worker is, but more about the type of work being done."
2020-06-29 15:16,"I've had some employees who were far more productive when they worked (software development) at home. For most, however, the opposite was true.

I was able to make remote work work for my business, but some dismissals were required along with considerable corrective action.

Was it more trouble than it was worth? Some days, definitely, other days, not so bad."
2020-06-29 15:18,"It all comes down to one thing, the effectiveness of the manager. If you aren't good at aligning your team's goals with the goals of the department/corporation, removing obstacles for your team members to meet those goals, developing and nurturing relationships, and lack trust of and from your team members, you're going to suffer in this climate.  I'll also say, this is more about ""leadership"" than ""management"".  
The other thing I'll mention is that it's really different when EVERYONE is remote.  Highly skilled, qualified remote workers often get passed over for promotions because it goes to the ""person down the hall"" who's in corp every day.  Not now - now it's a level playing field - and a lot of ""corp climbers"" are suffering because the one advantage they had is gone."
2020-06-29 15:19,"Technology has evolved so much that I started thinking that even remote classes are possible. As a teacher, I never liked remote learning as the core of teaching - they could be accessory at best in my view. However, with the current platforms, it is not only possible; it is feasible and even cheaper if everybody has internet access. I think of what is happening with remote work is just the same token; you don't need to face traffic jams and expose yourself to uncontrollable diseases just to do something you can do - efficiently - at home."
2020-06-29 15:21,"Having worked remotely off and on for the past 20 years as a software developer, I can say that it works well for me, but also that it isn't for everyone.  I think it is likely that more companies will develop a hybrid model, with some working from home and others going to the office every day, or perhaps just fewer days at the office each week."
2020-06-29 15:22,"Why does the article focus so little on companies that have successfully managed large work-from-home teams for years?  There are plenty. Apple, Amazon, Hilton, Marriott, and United Health come to mind immediately.   They all have some teams that work from offices, but thousands that do not."
2020-06-29 15:22,"I really don't buy into the main idea of this story. I telecommuted as early as the early 1990's and got more done at home regardless of the day of the week. Telecommuting was never an excuse for not getting assignments completed. During work hours I was always available by phone and email. The only three day weekends were on holidays. I agree that working from home is not for everyone, especially the easily distracted. We should not rush into full time work at home without thinking, but a lot of workers have found out during the coronavirus that they don't really need to go into the office everyday to get their work done."

I've worked remotely for 30 years. its such a great deal I didnt want the poor stiffs sentenced seeing how great it is. no wasted commute hours etc, etc, etc.

my job is to visit clients sites and report in writing. there's no reason to waste hours of commute time to sit across the table from a supervisor telling them in person what I can tell them on video or phone.I can see all the sad faces of the kumbaya/collaborate people now as reality intrudes on their happy parties.

sure its critical to have self-starters in the field. if you dont have the motivation to get up in the morning all by yourself, then you just cant. I'm so ridiculously productive working at home its stunning. if anything, I work too much. but as an introvert with a small family whose biggest kicks dont come from sitting around, overeating and getting drunk, working remotely is THE way. if I had to work in an office I'd quit tomorrow. I'm old enough. but why in the world would I quit? I do something I love, get paid well, and dont waste my life in pointless watercooler conversations with people I have superficial relationships with nor have to satisfy the controlling nature of excess management. win."
2020-06-29 15:33,"I don't think there's any one answer.  Some employees work just as well at the office, or from home.   Others work better at one or the other.  Also, working from home, and the difficulties it can sometimes present to employers (i.e., less output from employees) isn't always just a matter of trust or a lack thereof.  Some of us simply have a harder time concentrating in our homes, vs in a structured office environment,  and this is all the more true for those of us who don't have the luxury of a 'home office' or similar.  Some of us are literally sitting at our little kitchen cafe table, or countertop stool, hunched over our PCs day after day.  It can also be a separate challenge for those of us who live alone.  There is no break in our routine or our physical location.  The COVID lockdowns only exacerbated this.

Some companies will surely continue to push for working from home, if only to recoup some of their losses due to COVID.  I'm sure many corp tenants have worked out deals, cut down on space or cancelled their commercial leases entirely.  Corp America has seen entire new swathes of employees who've demonstrated that they can indeed be just as functional, and even while homeschooling at the same time!  So imagine how much better these employees would function at home, once kids can return to school.   Many employers will surely try to maintain WFH, to recoup recent losses and ensure higher profit margins going forward.  It's anyone's guess how long it may stick."

2020-06-29 15:34,"Anyone who thinks that working from home has a strong future has very little regard for the careers of working mothers, who have suffered enormously professionally and personally during the lockdown.  All measures of ""research outputs"" from female academics, who have also been charged with a disproportionate share of the pastoral care of their students and of the academic housekeeping that has kept everyone pretty much on course, demonstrate that their productivity has been decimated while male colleagues have published rather than taught or caring for their own or anyone else's children."

Interestingly though, this time period has served to break some of the chummy bonds of those at the corporate HQ who were accustomed to solving problems by popping into each others' offices. The net result is more inclusivity across the teams as they actually take a beat and consider who might best be included. That said, the execs are hot to get teams back into the office - and I do value what is learned and spawned from hallway conversation."
2020-06-29 15:38,People like to have the option and flexibility of working from home. No one wants to work from home all the time neither will the work done be very effective.
2020-06-29 15:38,"Inevitably, this trend will rip the lid off the privilege inherent in white collar, so-called ""knowledge work."" Most of these workers do very little sustained work, and what they do has very little meaningful impact on their businesses or society. It's mostly computer busy work, navel-gazing and log-rolling--all with fat salaries and benefits. When spyware gets rebranded as ""automated people management tools"" and becomes ubiquitous, vast armies of formerly well-paid ""executives"" will be superfluous."
2020-06-29 15:39,"I believe there is a happy medium here.  After working 23 yrs remotely, I could not even imagine going back into an office.  My productivity is higher without the office distractions. However, new hires, new younger professionals, need that connection in an office.  Possibly creative teams.  I think this is all wrong that if you can see people you know they are working.  Really wrong approach. You should know people are working based upon their output .  If you as a management team cannot define goals, quality measures of work, timelines for deliverables, expected availability and accountability, how are you going to do that staring down people's necks and installing spyware?  That's weak management IMO"
2020-06-29 15:39,"It's not one-size-fits-all.  Certain roles / functions are quite well suited to WFH, others are not.  Same goes for certain personalities - some handle it better than others (and even excel at it).  To be so dismissive of the concept reflects small thinking."
2020-06-29 15:40,"You cite one unheard-of public relations company and IBM as reasons why remote work is a dead end, with no causation for IBM's decision to bring people back into the office, aside from a vague ""revenue slump."" Not much of a case to build upon."
2020-06-29 15:41,"I think it's extraordinarily premature to say that companies will suddenly pivot to remote work forever, even post-Covid. This is just one of those ever-popular hot takes about how everything will ""change forever"" because of the viral outbreak--something we simply can't really know because of how fluid the situation is around the globe.

But I would be sad--devastated, really--if remote work was forced upon me forever. Can I work remotely? Sure. I even enjoy doing it every so often. Working from home every weekday, week after week, however, is spiritually draining for me. I HATE Zoom and Skype and all video calls, which hurt my eyes and make me feel so much anxiety all the time. Give me in-person meetings over Zoom almost any day.

I may be an introvert, but I miss the commute, the office, the lunch and coffee breaks, the ease of turning to my boss and asking a question. Some employees will work well remotely long-term, and some will grow to resent it deeply. Others can work well on a flexible basis. Still others will do their best work primarily in the office. This is just reality--we're different. We need to be able to return to our offices when it's safe to, and we need, too, the option to have more flexible schedules.

I'm tired of hot takes that claim that the office is ""dead."" It's like the silly people who claim that physical books are ""dead"" every time e-books appear in the news. We have to wait and see, but the ""death"" of such foundational ideas is never that simple."

Millions are going to need serious psychological help by the time a vaccine/cure is found.
Remote work is not here to stay

WFH is more productive... maybe... maybe not.
But forcing a whole entire nation of working population to stay locked up for decades to avoid a virus is absolutely insane.

Hundreds of clothing companies, restaurants in downtown areas are all going to go bankrupt if this is the way of the future
Not to mention airlines (when business travel ends) and the millions that work in airport restaurants, and ground crew

2020-06-29 15:43,"I never ever wanted to work from home but as coronavirus was tightening its grip and pressure from my sister and her family, I was forced to work from home.  By the time we went home, there were four employees and a single manager left.  It took four days but I finally got the equipment I needed to flee.  So now I am here.  I live alone and have no day-to-day company.  I would love to return to the office but I seriously don't think it will ever happen.  My company has been trying to make me work from home for years but I like being with people.  Of the four employees and a single manager?  One two employees are left and everyone else was furloughed.  Anyone who thinks that working from home is a cakewalk when you've only yourself is ill-informed.  I am never going back to the office but it's because they will never have a vaccine before I retire."
2020-06-29 15:45,"It seems odd to me to equate more/less productivity with physical location. I imagine the differences in productivity, whether working remotely or in the office, come down to whether employees have clear objectives and deadlines, feel connected to their work and greater mission, have adequate resources to do their work, and remain engaged w/ colleagues and managers as necessary. Neither the office nor a remote situation is a guarantee of either; hence, everyone's experiences vary. For those who are experiencing a positive or negative benefit during a shift to remote work, I imagine it has to do with one of those factors changing -- location is a red herring."

He has been promoted and assessed as a high level and productive employee of a major corporation.

2020-06-29 15:51,"I've been telecommuting full time since 1990 to live in a remote place.  I always worked on site the first month or so of a new job.  At first I visited the office every couple of months, but it became less and less with longer tenancy in a position. I think I hadn't been to the office in over a year before I ""retired"" from my last job. There is certainly value in the chance meetings and casual friendships at a workplace, both for productivity and for the personal satisfaction of feeling like part of a team. In general the motivation to support your team members is more important than a corporate bottom line.
It wasn't always easy to maintain focus and it's not for everyone.  I will say zoom centered meetings are way better than being on speaker phone for in-person meetings, but formal meetings have always been a necessary evil in my experience. There will be some shakeout as go deep into telecommuting and then pull back. After being forced to go all in companies will understand it better.

How's that Weather app doing?"
2020-06-29 14:47,"I can understand that a single adult who works in tech, IT, social media would love WFH.  
What about a married couple with kids?    Cat in the Cradle — that’s me.  My kid graduated HS this year (well, sort of, if you call Zoom a graduation), and I am in a deep depression bc of how I squandered my time with her.  
Because of smart phones & email, most of us already have to maintain 24/7 availability.  I haven’t taken a vacation in 15 years where I wasn’t interrupted every day with “urgent” issues.  Heck, I haven’t taken a vacation at all in four years as my company has undergone three management changes and a merger in that time period.  
Now this $100B company which pays the CEO about 90x what I earn (and I earn 8x what my team coordinator makes) wants to use my home as their office space.  In discussing WFH over endless Zoom meetings, where voices cut out and pictures freeze, I can see the glee in senior management at how much money this will save, as they sit by their pools or in their lavish home offices while half the assistants living in studios don’t have air conditioning or yards.
Just like hot-desking, WFH is a horrible idea bc it erases the last possible aspect of work-life balance — physical separation.
If you want people to WFH, folks are also gonna OFH ... organize from home a union for fellow corporate drones.
Seriously, the corporate CEO will soon replace Trump as the enemy of the people."

If work-from-home became the primary way of working, New York could suffer a body blow in lost revenue: lost sales taxes that would be the result of fewer people eating, drinking and shopping during the day, lost property taxes because of devalued office towers, and lost jobs whose salaries could likely be no longer be taxed.  But guess what: though it will make some permanent inroads, work-from home isn't going to become the primary way of working.  All of these breathless, dire warnings will look histrionic once the pandemic is controlled.  (Yeah, I know. Waiting on November 3.)

I started working from home in 2008 and that's the way I've worked ever since. While face time with colleagues is reduced, it can be recouped with electronic conferencing tools and, I don't know,  FaceTime? And Duo? How about a good, old-fashioned phone call to exchange ideas? 

I don't want New York to suffer a body blow.  But please provide more balance when covering work from home.  You have begun to resemble Ebenezer Scrooge berating Bob Cratchit.  It's not a good look."

2020-06-29 14:24,"I was one of those IBM'ers working from home - from 2001 through 2006, when I left - for a job in an office. IBM had this policy to save money on real-estate, and it did not invest in training managers or employees on how to make the best use of remote working. I found I worked harder and longer at home for IBM than I subsequently did in my office-bound job, but felt less values, lonelier and isolated - there was no team-building or team spirit. In the end, I hated it.  Mr. Laermer, who designated Fridays as an official 'work-from-home' day was an idiot - many many white-collar employees in the US 'work from home' on Fridays between Memorial Day and Labor Day - and use the day to travel to their Summer/Weekend homes or generally relax. In IBM, It was impossible to find colleagues, whether officially 'working from home' or not, via phone, email or Sametime (IBM precursor to WhatsApp) anytime after midday on Summer Fridays. It was an understood thing - especially for employees with children. Now that video-conferencing is ubiquitous and reliable, and a critical mass of people are working from home - and are from a generation that have grown up with remote communication and social interaction, working from home has become much more generally feasible - but face-to-face organised meetings for team-building,  reviews, brainstorming etc are still needed. A different type of 'office' space and layout, with intermittent or shared usage agreements, will be required to cater for this."

40 years in HR.  This was tried in the 1980s, it was called telecommuting!  Few takers, and most of those were asking to come back ‘in from the cold’ after one month.  This is not in the human DNA.  Home all day, the kids, the spouse/partner ‘honey do list’, etc., etc.  Humans want to groom themselves, flirt, hang-out over lunch, maybe a drink after work, and so on...  Oh, yes, home all day is a concept ‘to die for’.  Get real."
2020-06-29 14:32,"In the same way that the police are not the ones to ask about whether we should have certain laws, managers are not the ones to ask about working from home.

But, if it were actually possible to objectively measure worker output - we'd not need as many managers.
I have been WHF for three months now

2020-06-29 15:53,"Dear Workers, 

If we want remote work to last this time, it's going to take some effort on our part. 

Working from home is work. It's not time to mow your lawn between conference calls. Your kids and pets don't have priority over meetings and customers. Don't make anyone who needs you look for you - answer your cell phone, keep your email  and instant messaging clients up with notifications on and be attentive to them. 

In my industry, we've often joked that our leaders trust us to break and restore services to millions of customers overnight in planned maintenance from home but don't trust us to work tickets during the day at the same place. That's because many of our colleagues use 'work from home' time as 'work on home' time. 

If you can't make work the priority when at home, it's not for you and does a disservice to those that can."
2020-06-29 15:54,"Was this article sent in via fax? or possibly carrier pigeon? Because seriously, the 80s called and they want their ideas about work back. Also, if you really don't know what your employees do when you aren't watching them, you didn't notice that they wasted a lot of time when they were stuck ""working"" in a cube. 

The world has changed and moved on by necessity. The only people who are going to cry about this particular change, ultimately, are commercial real estate developers specializing in office buildings and people in middle management who can't justify their jobs unless they're having a ton of time-wasting meetings. My advice to them is to get a dog if they need constant attention that much."

Technologically we are not there yet. the real obstacle is different."
2020-06-29 15:56,"Two thoughts about this:
1) I don't understand why so many (particularly in the media) like to make this conversation about the extremes; either all remote or none. In reality, a mix works best and that's how most companies operated pre-COVID-19. The sweet spot is 2-3 days a week. Sure some will work from home full-time and some won't do it all, but when given a choice, the majority of people want a mix. They get their collaborative and social time 'at work' and heads-down time at home. 
2) The media loves to cite the failures (Yahoo, Best Buy, IBM), but a) they represent a minority, b) they were all deeply troubled companies when they called back their remote workers. In the case of Yahoo, the CEO indicated people weren't working as hard (as evidenced by VPN traffic). Sorry, but that's a management problem, not a remote work problem. If you don't know what your people are doing when they're out of the office, then you probably don't know what they're doing when their in the office because you're obviously not managing by results. Recalling remote workers because these companies did is a strategy in following the loser."
2020-06-29 15:56,Since the beginning of Covid I have been working from home 2 to 3 days per week.  Not being in the office or at home full time seems to work.  I don't have to commute every day but I still see people's faces.
2020-06-29 15:58,"This article appears to be written by people who never worked in an office, bless their hearts.  

The major change not acknowledged here is the post 2008 large scale real estate strategy pivot to hoteling/open plan spaces, where workers no longer have assigned desks or private offices, and where there often not enough seats because employees are expected to WFH once or twice a week.

Open plan seating is fairly miserable, and one of the most irritating side effects is that walls suddenly become a status symbol for middle managers or engineers.  It’s an ongoing problem with satisfaction and engagement.  Sending everyone home solves these problems and more: disability accommodations, cost of facility operations, etc."
2020-06-29 13:29,"I truly don’t care what is more productive for big companies like Best Buy and Facebook. I care about the workers dealing with the positives and negatives of working from home. Everyone with children has been taking care of them at the same time as working during this pandemic. Amazing. Some workers are expected to be available 24/7 because employers think, “what else could they be doing at a time like this?” People are starting to question the concept of a 40 hour work week and who we work for and why. The future of work will be different and many of us care a lot less about our employers than we did before."

The history of work from home is that a job that involves nearly zero (internal) human interaction/zero creativity s perfectly suited for work from home/outsourcing.

Nearly any business can survive a few months on momentum alone, but once real decisions and real creativity are required - as they eventually will -  work from home becomes a severe liability."
2020-06-29 16:03,"This assessment of work from home productivity privileges the perspective of upper management. I've been working from home for 8 years, both part time and salaried full time. Of course, companies and employees are different, but I will say that the home-based employees I know, while they have a more flexible schedule and no commute, are often overworked. When management can't see you, they don't know - and don't have to care - how that new company policy adds 20 minutes to an hour to your work day. They don't see you sitting in the office until 9 pm or don't have to look you in the eye when they leave at 5, while you're frantically typing at your desk. They don't have to think about simple changes that will increase efficient use of time for their workers. They can just pile it on, and expect it to get done on time. When I began, I worked a manageable 45 hours a week. Just before I ended my full time position and went to part time, I was working 10 to 12 hour days at a breakneck speed, because of multiple little changes to our work processes adding up and never being adequately time-studied by management. In the end, I transitioned to part time because I was tired of being taken advantage."
2020-06-29 16:03,"The unspoken problem here is that most managers have no idea how to manage, and really have no interest. They just want the status of being managers, or just like bossing people.

2020-06-29 16:04,"The voices of commercial real estate are really coming out of the woodwork. Commuting is a psychological burden, ecological disaster, and health negative. It limits job availability by geography, even in the information economy. Learning to work remote is one of the best realistic things the rich world could do for itself and the global greater good. But “change is scary” thinking makes any criticism of remote work look legitimate. 

After three months of remote work, I feel more connected to friends, family, community, and humanity. I no longer spend 2  hours/day with other stressed out commuters, feeling minor rudeness build up a callousness against my fellow human beings. I’m more productive (using all that commute time for work), I get more and better sleep, and I can take breaks mid day much more comfortably.

People who want to go back should do so, but I’m tired of reading articles with the message that everyone needs to go back to polluting, stressing out, and wasting time in order to justify the existence of office space."
2020-06-29 16:06,"I dramatically miss the office. Even though it was an open-office layout that killed productivity, i was still more productive there than i am at home in my 600 sq ft 1 BR apartment. Why? At least for me, I do better when temptation is removed from my life. I don't rely on willpower to not eat a pint of ice cream each night; i simply just don't keep ice cream in my house. 

The office environment is set up, or at least should be, to facilitate getting work done. I have two large monitors, a standing desk, and limited access to things that zap my productivity (mostly online chess, but also TV, my kitchen, and the fact that somehow no matter how much one tidies there is always more to tidy (fml)). 

Also, I work for a large organization in a back-office white collar profession, and firmly believe the studies that say humans resemble ant colonies: 20% of the ants do 80% of the work. That is definitely the case in my organization. I'm sure the people who were slacking off at the office are the same people slacking off at home, and the good workers in the office are the good workers at home. A lot of people have blamed management for failing in the remote workplace. I agree, most management is not that good. But i find the biggest problem from management in fairly well paid back office white collar jobs in manhattan is not pushing employees hard enough. The amount of mediocrity making 6 figure salaries is mind-blowing....."
2020-06-29 16:06,"Having worked from home for several years (and being the first at my old company to do so), it really takes a combination of some office time and disciplined home time to make it work.  I was significantly more productive at home for all the usual reasons such as lack of interruptions, no lost time making chit-chat at the water cooler, etc.  But my day or days in the office were very important for team cohesiveness, getting in that chit-chat, better team and group meetings.  It was great not to burn fossil fuel just to sit in front a computer for hours.  For many jobs, a balance of home and office could be perfect as long as it works for the employees."

People who don't love their jobs may of course have more challenges, but that would be true as well if they were in the office.

Additionally, not as many people on the roads means that air pollution in many places has decreased, in some places in a striking way.  Am I missing the discourse on this aspect?  I don't think I've seen too many articles on this and what we as a society could do to keep this positive aspect."

Productivity is  variable when compared with working in the office. While I'm deep in the details of a design, I find working in my home office at home far better as interruptions and distractions are reduced. That is the majority of my work, but the other parts matter as well. My design needs to work with software, and this involves discussions between the hardware design team and the software design team. These are far easier to do in person, sometimes unscheduled, sometimes very informal while we are both getting coffee/tea. Or eating lunch. This part of my job basically requires me to be there."

Perhaps that's why you ""couldn't find them"" once they were allowed to commute from home- they felt enslaved at their jobs. I'd go missing too. America is too overworked, underpaid (even some people in the tech industry) and too stuck in bureaucratic  hierarchies. Plenty of other nations manage 3 or 4 day work weeks absolutely find and studies across the board say productivity went UP, not down. This is a uniquely American problem because of the unequal, exploitive way Americans work. And this article is rather elitist- what about low wage workers?"
2020-06-29 16:14,"This article unfortunately reads as though it was pitched to the reporter by a couple of PR firms who have commercial real estate clients who are desperate to see their tenants come back to their over-priced office space. What could have been a much more nuanced look at what are the implications of much of the office-bound world suddenly being thrust into a global WFH situation - and what learnings, opportunities and challenges will come from that in the long run - instead reads like a list of grievances from managers who long for the office environment of 30-plus years ago when ""telecommuting"" was a hip new thing. 

A lot of the people quoted in this article need to wake up and realise that it is not the 1980s. The world has changed dramatically. The effects of the pandemic are still very unclear. But what is increasingly clear to most rational people is that the comforts of the office life pre-Covid will likely never come back again. And that's a good thing for many reasons."
2020-06-29 16:16,"I’ve worked for both Google and Facebook and spent a minimum of 2 days a week working from home throughout my career. These are some of the most profitable, successful companies out there. As a mom, remote work gives me loads more options in terms of reduced commuting time and flexibility for childcare pickup, something not mentioned in this article.

A lot of the corporate examples mentioned in the article had deeper management and organizational problems, not remote work problems. Also, remote work is a spectrum. The vast majority of workers in Silicon Valley expect 1-2 days remote as standard, as well as a culture that does not rely on “facetime” to make sure employees are getting things done. Different problems arise when the entire company is teleworking, but there are places, like Wordpress, that successfully do this. Building a culture of trust, measurable output, and performance ratings becomes important, and more effective, than the culture of “Janet comes in at 8 every day so she must be a top performer.”

The last point I’ll add is my current team is distributed across four countries and multiple US cities, meaning 60% of my meetings are on video chat even before the pandemic. This makes it someone trivial if I dial in from home, too."
2020-06-29 16:17,"Work forces in the future will be divided into two groups, one who can work very well and even more efficiently at home and other who cannot do well from home. If you are kind of person who can only do your job in office setting due to your inability to adapt new changing environment, company will ask you to pay costs for office lease, electricity, insurance et al, as it is your problem. The company does not have any more luxury to boost emotional deficiencies to adapt new order. There are already tens of peoples who work very well from home. This is not new. Just happened to re-calibrated pushed by pandemic."
2020-06-29 16:19,"I had a great opportunity to visit a friend working at Google / Venice, CA.  It was probably the highlight of my working career, getting the grand tour and lunch to top it off.  Off course, I left my house at 10:00 to get there at 11:00 and left Google at 2:00 to get home by 3:00.

And I realized something, unless you had a $1.5 to $3.0 million condo within walking distance of the office, you weren't going to last very long.  The on-going stress of the commute is more than most human beings can tolerate. 

Now that Google is expanding into West LA at the Westside Pavillion, how are you going to get the workers from home to the office?  The Star Trek Transporter is not functional just yet."

2020-06-29 16:21,"I have been working at home for about 34 years, participated on numerous project teams, even leading quite a few. My creativity has not been diminished nor has my social interactions where creative ideas were discussed and even birthed. I have never felt lonely or socially isolated. I wouldn't change the way I work for anything. Of course, I also often leave my home office to meet with clients and team members, to do field research, and to attend conferences and workshops.

My commute is about 39 steps.

Given my experience, I find the criticisms  and concerns about remote work a lot of horse puckey.  Even considering that I've not had children at home to deal with, my bet is that vast numbers of people will be far happier with remote working than the traditional office slog. 

If mangers need their people to always work together do they have a workplace or a work by committee organizational structure. Maybe they don't know how to manage people? Or they lack confidence and constantly need other people around them to confirm they are in charge?

Finally, and very importantly, the positive economic benefits of remote work can be enormous on household, town and regional levels."
2020-06-29 16:24,"I work from home and have for the last five years. What used to take me eight hours to achieve at the office takes four or five hours now at home. 
One of my team works remotely as well, while raising her two year old. Between us, the only slowdowns we hit are when our workflow depends on something from someone back at the office..."
2020-06-29 16:25,"I have mixed feelings about this.  I have worked in an office but I do tech support for multiple remote locations.  Working from home has been a boon for me and I hope to be able to continue to do so.  My productivity has actually increased: I have fewer interruptions from colleagues that just drop in to chat and am able to throw a load of laundry in on my break  - that and not wasting time with a commute leaves me more free time at home and less stressed on my job.  And just for the record, I'm an extrovert so that is probably the only downside for me."
2020-06-29 16:32,My boss was not a fan of work-from-home but his mind was changed after our group proved to be more productive and focused since the pandemic forced us all to work from home. He's in no hurry to get us back into the office. It can work with the right tools and support from management.
2020-06-29 16:33,"If I were a CEO, I'd be cautious about the increase in productivity over the last 3 months, studies have shown that virtually any change temporarily boosts productivity:

This is something psychologist Elton Mayo, pioneer of organizational theory, discovered by studying American factory workers in the ’30s.

The experiment was initially set up to see which factory conditions make workers most productive. The researchers began by brightening the factory light, which increased productivity. But once they dimmed the light, productivity rose again. They soon realized that it didn’t matter what the change was—productivity would rise when any change would be made to the work environment. Employees felt like the managers cared about them and their work environments, so they worked harder.

This phenomenon was dubbed “the Hawthorne Effect.”"
2020-06-29 16:40,"Out of sight, out of mind.  

I worked in IT management for years and grew to not be a fan of teleworking.  I supervised people in remote locations around the country, and learned the enormous amount of attention they need to not feel abandoned.  I traveled a lot just to see them.

There is tremendous value in people being together, seeing each all the time.  Leaning over the cubicle wall and discussing something; seeing a coworker at the coffee machine and remembering you need to talk to her about a project; letting your IT people see a problem in person.

Here's an example:  our company, headquartered on the east coast, had an office in LA where a new app was running.  The response time over the nationwide network was awful: enter a transaction, hit enter, then wait interminably for something to happen.  Repeated trouble tickets to the network and application support groups drew little response, since their statistics told them everything was ""fine.""  Finally, our department VP sent a senior network engineer and an application designer to LA to see for themselves.  They were there about 5 minutes and called home office, saying in effect, ""this is terrible, why didn't you say something?""  (I resisted the temptation to email them a mountain of trouble tickets which had been glossed over.)  Having seen the problem in person, corrective actions were completed in two weeks.  

Out of sight, out of mind."
2020-06-29 16:48,"I live on Long Island and for the last 13 years (until the pandemic), commuted to an office in the Meadowlands in New Jersey. When I started back in 2007, I could reasonably expect that the commute would be a little under an hour in the morning, and on a bad day, an hour and a half to get home. Not terrible for a NYC commute. Certainly not ideal though. I alternated between mass transit and the car, depending on anticipated traffic flow. During the last decade, mass transit has gotten progressively unusable;  the prevalence of LIRR and NJT delays, breakdowns and infrastructure issues has more or less eliminated that as a reliable way to travel. So, I'm left with the car. Rising tolls, and a commute time that has stretched to well over an hour in the morning and 2 plus hours on the way home had me thinking about finding new employment closer to home. All the while, despite ample evidence that productivity among remote workers tends to increase, and despite evidence that my personal productivity was among the highest in the company, the powers that be were extremely stingy with remote working despite having the technology to offer it to a broad range of employees. 

Fast-forward to March.They sent everyone home and nobody has been in the office since. We are now a 100% remote work-force and having one of our best years. Nobody is in a hurry to get back, including upper management. Despite some resistance from the old guard I think this new mode of working is here to stay."
2020-06-29 16:48,Working from home is just better. People are healthier and thus more projective. Health care costs are likely going to go way down for companies with work from home allowances. No one really wants anything to do with office life. It’s toxic.
2020-06-29 16:51,"I first started working from home in the 1980's, email was in its infancy and online access was through propriatory software via dial up modem. It worked but it was cumbersome and inefficient. 

For the past 10+ years i've been working from home exclusievly. It's now seemless and  more efficient than if I commuted to an office. However, part of why it works for me is because all the people I interface with are remote sales people and their customers, so it doesn't matter where I am.

That doesn't mean it will work for every occupation, it'll work in some cases and not others, its not black or white. 

As for online meetings, to me the current state is like working remote in the 1980's. The tech for online meetings needs to vastly improve and it needs to be platform and device independent, otherwise it'll never worl well."
2020-06-29 16:54,"Lucky the story wrote itself from the comments -- technology has shifted, different people may prefer/prevail from different ways of working.  We're learning from education that -- different from what the teachers imagined -- many kids like learning at home.  Jury's still out; there will be lots of variations on a theme when we come back. But how to manage: that remains a composite of clarifying, motivating, assessing, rewarding. That didn't change, but how to get there, maybe has."
2020-06-29 13:28,"Much of this article depends on a presumption about the sort of relationship we should have with our jobs/careers.

e.g. (from the article): ""In a Morning Consult survey in late May on behalf of Prudential, 54 percent said they wanted to work remotely. In a warning sign for managers, the same percentage of remote workers said they felt less connected to their company.""

Is feeling ""less connected to (your) company"" something that should strike your heart with fear, or should it uplift you? 

Of course I feel less connected to my company since I started working from home every day ... but you know what else I feel? Less rushed, less depressed, better rested ... etc., etc. ... I realize some people love their office and have close friends there, and that's great --  regardless, though, I think we're past due on a look-in-the-mirror moment regarding our abusive relationship with work culture and quote endquote ""productivity"""
2020-06-29 13:58,"Does Mr. Laermer have no female employees? It's the only explanation for refusing to acknowledge the child care crisis we are in right now (and no, I don't think men are equally burdened).  Not sure exactly how workers can avoid using their work time for child care, given that kids are mandated to be home.

I'd like to also point out that remote work isn't just your office life taken online.  Working from home makes work more concentrated.  No coffee breaks, no impromptu meetings, no time lost to going to and from conference rooms.  It's ridiculous to impose an 8.5 hour day when remote work is so well suited to a 6 hour day.  Let's be honest, the average office worker has around 4 hours of productivity a day.  Remote work lays this bare.  We can substantially reduce work hours, keep (or even increase) productivity, and increase worker happiness by shortening our days.  Sure this requires good team management, but it is the ultimate upside to working from home.  I've worked from home for years. I start at 8am and finish by 2pm.  It requires careful time management, but the freedom I get is well worth it.  Can we finally stop with the obsessive ""make-work"" that permeates office culture?"
2020-06-29 16:55,"It is easy to successfully work remotely in the short term or part-time or to do certain kinds of mechanical tasks.  But everyone benefits from the informal chit-chat that happens at random when people are together.  This drives fresh ideas and innovation which will otherwise suffer in the long term.  It is difficult to grasp a companies culture without being in the office.  Of course, if you start in an office, you take the culture with you remotely, but that base is still needed to feel a part of something."
2020-06-29 14:24,"This article completely missed the point.  Telework isn't the problem.  The problem is that corporate management hasn't caught up with the skills and techniques necessary to manage a remote workforce.

My micromanaging boss was absolutely against telecommuting.  She was one of those ""I need my people here"" types, which is French for ""I can't stop by your desk five times a day to ask you to help me sharpen a pencil.""  Coronavirus had other plans.

It took a week or two to adjust, but I have found that I am actually MORE productive at home.  When I have downtime, or am taking a moment to decompress, I can actually check off tasks at home.  Do a load of laundry, check on the kids, or take a walk.  I'm not sitting in my miserable little cubicle pretending to work.  My web surfing has decreased significantly, because I'm not filling idle time with fluff.

My team communicates easily with Teams, and the focus has switched from hours in the chair to tasks completed.  I'm a lot happier as an employee, and personally hope we never return.

And my micromanaging boss?  The other day she said ""this has really worked out well, I don't see a reason to rush back to the office.""  If she can be convinced, anybody can."
2020-06-29 14:03,"The company-centered bias of this piece was astounding. I thought I would be adding a lone comment to the mix but have been encouraged to see others feeling and voicing the same thoughts. From someone who just pulled an all nighter for work from a Sunday to Monday, with a job that has no work-life balance and can happen at any time of day with no boundaries respected, the idea of being leas productive because I’m out to take advantage of hiding from a manager or boss is preposterous. I can’t hide. And we are all clinging to paychecks now and also doing our best to get by. The assumption that workers want to work remotely so that they don’t work and get paid for a vacation, bringing a company’s profitability down, is not a very human-centered perspective and erases us and our value (as people, not as money). Maybe if we had workplaces where the work culture wasn’t only to create somewhat good work and profitability for a few, but to actually create something that makes a difference in this world, where employees are valued as humans and where their potential is seen as more than dollar figures, lack of profitability wouldn’t be a concern for the author or corporate America. We would be playing a bigger, more exciting and inspiring game than a blame game it expanding the pie for the select few."

I am at least as productive at home as at the office and I save 2 amazing hours each day not having to get dressed up for work plus the lengthy commute in Atlanta traffic each day.  I can't speak about how it works for other people but I love to work from home and believe my best work is done there.  Time saved allows me to get up a little later, make dinner for my family and, yes, even work a little more."
2020-06-29 13:32,"No benefit in generalizing whether remote working is beneficial or not.  It may work for some companies, some employees, some industries, some locations.  It doesn't have to be none or all.  Technology and company culture are big pieces."
2020-06-29 16:57,"The opening example of some employees turning the work-from-home Friday into a 3-day weekend is not really a good analogy for what’s going on today. In my pre-COVID experience, for many offices Fridays were low productivity days to begin with, employees are tired and not as motivated as Mondays. So when companies tell employees they can now work from home on Fridays only - especially if the company gives it a cutesy name like “summer Fridays” - it feels like more of a trap than a real test. They don’t trust their employees to begin with so they hold up the actions of a few “slackers” as an example of why no employees can be allowed this benefit. If they were serious about it they’d test it on a day other than Friday."
2020-06-29 16:57,There are far too many jobs across every possible industry that cannot be done efficiently with everyone working from home.  And this article doesnt address that topic sufficiently.  In other words you might be able to have 20% of a good sized company work from home and still be efficient but I cannot imagine that % going much higher than that generally speaking.   A publishing house for example could certainly have many working from home but a catering company not so much.
2020-06-29 14:24,"This article references a lot of anecdotal experiences of companies/management but completely ignores the experience of workers. I’d be interested in hearing more from working parents, particularly mom’s, and how they likely benefit from remote work/flexible schedules (obviously covid is also not entirely representative of a remote model as childcare has inevitably been hoisted on parents). The author references Marissa Mayer and her policy of face time in the office but doesn’t mention that she brought her own child to work and had a nursery built next to her office (she had the luxury of added face time with her child, a benefit she was denying her workers)."

2020-06-29 13:53,"I've been working from home for 25 years. Began in the dial-up modem era. Full-time jobs except for one layoff. At home you are cut off from people. There may be days, especially in deep winter, where you don't leave the house. And I live in a city. 

But some people work better alone. I'm one of them. The introvert part of me relishes the total focus and quiet. My professional life has not suffered. 

I go to the office a few times a year. It's a drive. They give me a desk and the few I work with stop by to say hello, but for the most part no one knows who I am, what I do or why I'm even there. I can't wait to leave. Most are 20 years younger than me, so it may be some of that. I feel invisible. 

My dog, however, is very happy to see me."
2020-06-29 17:00,"The future is now, the large mutual benefit for workers, employers and the environment are here to stay as everyone benefits (including non-knowledge workers). 

Knowledge based Employees get to live more normal lives allowing them to cook at home, workout between meetings and being there when there kids come home from school (once they return) all while meeting the demands of work. Additional benefits include lower costs of living (for all wokers) compared to urban cores since one can move to more rural confines with good internet as opposed to live in crowded cities with a required commute and this spreading out of knowledge workers will inject money into more rural communities allowing non-knowledge workers to live closer to the places they work (lower density = lower cost).

The commute alone was costly in terms of time, money and environment. The large office footprint is a huge expense for employers and office buildings are some of the largest contributors to pollution on the planet, while we still will need gathering places, we will not need as large of spaces.

I for one never want to go to an office more than once or twice a month for the human touch meetings needed for psychological inclusiveness (client meetings or employee catch ups), the savings are too great for the costs incurred."
2020-06-29 17:01,"It is amusing to read about manager’s concerns about employees doing work. How do these managers  ensure that employees are actually doing work in an office? Just by seeing them seating in a space? Remote work has the advantage of clarity on results, not office politics or hour spent on a seat. This is a major shift in traditional management practices. Old-school companies and managers will continue to push back and think that going back to the office is a matter of time.

Agile and smarter companies understand the competitive advantages of building a remote first company (lower costs, access to a deeper pool of talent, higher employee satisfaction, etc) and are not hesitating to make the jump now. There are tools that exist today that did not just 5 years ago to enable remote work. Zoom is a clear one but there are other great innovations being developed such as GroWrk Remote, a company providing home office management solutions to make easier the transition to remote as more organizations embrace distributed workforce models."
2020-06-29 17:02,"Part of the problem is our culture.  When it’s normal for meetings to occur after midday on Friday, it will take more than logical reasons to change how people work.  We are obsessed with working harder instead of smarter."

2020-06-29 13:49,"The question isn't whether productivity can be sustained in the virtual space; it can and in some cases even be increased by remote work. It's about creativity; whether the virtual space offers people working in groups opportunities for serendipity, digression and playfulness that lead to true innovation. Much of this relies on interpersonal dynamics, of course, but screen-based communication flattens human affect no matter who you are, and the research shows clearly it's the missing small facial and verbal cues on Zoom that make the biggest difference. Right now, those of us working remotely are getting the job done, and adapting to a new work-life balance, but I'm not sure our individual and collective creative capacities are being enhanced by it. McLuhan's notion that ""we shape our tools and then our tools shape us"" comes to mind as a caution for the work-from-home age."

2020-06-29 17:08,"One of the best jobs I ever had as a nurse... was a job that hired me remotely.  There was an office, multiple locations... we delivered health care so that was unavoidable... but the management, hiring and HR experience were different, it just worked.  And seemed to work better.  The only reason I left that position was for another that offered health insurance I could actually afford, and union benefits.   My partner has worked from home as is hoping that it continues.  So like anything else, perhaps it’s not the fact that the experience is remote, but how it is set up and administered that matters most.  Looking at the cleaner air outside, less traffic on roads, is going back full bore to what we had before even make sense if there are other more sane choices?"
2020-06-29 17:11,"I think this writer is out of touch with the modern workplace conditions that have developed over the past 10 years with the advent of ""temporary employment"".  For years, companies have been using remote [alleged] temporary workers in order to avoid having to pay for benefits that must be provided to permanent workers under the law.  I have been working remotely for many years and find that I work more hours, and am more available and responsive when I am not exhausted from commuting 2 hours through crawling traffic over pothole ridden roads, searching for an hour for a parking space in a packed garage, and then fighting for a decent workspace in one of those first come first serve human corals of which tech and telecommunications companies became so enamored  and spent millions of $  to implement pre-COVID in order to save real estate costs.  Not all work places are Google or Apple with their ping pong tables and elaborate food services.  Most are full of exhausted commuters with their sack lunches jammed into  communal refrigerators hoping they can make it to their kid's daycare before the 6 pm deadline (because 2 late pickups = ouster from daycare).

2020-06-29 17:14,"There are so many differences between then and now.   When the work from home proposition was introduced, we were also adopting “casual Friday’s”.   “Casual” being the key concept.   Working from home was taken lightly and casually.    The Pandemic has upended all.   Now, it’s a matter of life and death.  The fact that so many people lost their jobs adds to the seriousness that people take their current responsibilities.   Most companies will attest that their businesses have been seamlessly  operating remotely.  Productivity is up, or at least where it should be.  Moving forward, we’ll probably have a hybrid model, but remote working is here to stay.   It will also open new opportunities for new technologies to emerge that are sharper, safer and better overall."

2020-06-29 17:15,"There's a huge difference between working from home now during the pandemic and when a vaccine is available and things return to normal. Right now we accept that the kids and pets are around and need to be taken care of and that multiple people are working from home. Laermer is right though When a vaccine is available, people will be expected to be available 9 to 5 for meetings and collaboration. There continues to be this belief that people spend most of their time working on their own projects and that this allows them to be flexible. Almost everything I do requires collaboration and coordination and bouncing ideas off colleagues. For this kind of work, productivity has dropped, because (understandably) colleagues are not available due to childcare, etc. Innovation does not happen in isolation. There is a reason why Silicon Valley is the center of internet-base innovation and it has to do with the ecosystem of talent, funding, research and marketing all in one place that has made this possible. you can't duplicate that kind of ecosystem on the internet."

There can be value to being in the office, but I also think that value is diminished when being in the office is mandated to be 40hrs & 5 days per week. 24 hrs in the office, 16 hrs work from home seems to be a nice balance. 

And I have to say, I can't help but notice that those who are so opposed to work from home seem to be a very uniform demographic (in terms of age). Taking such a hard nosed approach to progress rarely ages well from a historical perspective. Work from home is a huge benefit/perk that most workers have now had a taste of, and will seek out in future opportunities. Those who do not offer it will be at a competitive disadvantage.

Working from home has its benefits and disadvantages, like everything. Our company is adopting a work from home policy that gives workers the ability to come into an office, which will be much smaller than normal, on the days where face to face contact is desirable and needed. But much of the work can be done from home and done successfully. But only if you trust your employees not to abuse the luxury."

There are so many people who have worked this way before the pandemic for a variety of reasons – and are quite good at it – and plenty of employers whose prior experience managing remote workers has served them well during this time. And, for a lot of us, seeing companies make the leap to permanent remote work has been hugely encouraging; jobs for which we were eminently qualified, but were inaccessible to us, may finally be attainable.

I really, really encourage anyone at the Times reading this to think about remote work from an accessibility angle. This isn’t theoretical for us!"

Quoting Marissa Mayer, as if she is some kind of knowledgeable person? Laughable. She was powerless and called all back to office to hide her own failure. It did not work, did it?

Working from home (since March, after 30 years in offices) I can choose to communicate with any or all of my team members, at any time I want. And I don't get distracted by conversations that I don't want to be part of. I can go for a run or a walk if it helps me clear my mind, as long as I mention it on Slack. I don't lose time commuting and parking. And my children do not need child care. My employer measures my contributions by looking at my output and by verifying I deliver what I promise. We have a daily meeting in which each team member says what they are working on, what problems they are facing, and whether they are on track.

We could improve by providing each team member a drawing pad. White boards in offices were there for a reason.

The truth of the matter is that our 5-day 7 hours a day work week is antiquated and outdated. Workers in most other industrialized countries work less hours than in the United States.  The 35-40 work week is a throw back to our racist-plantation-sweatshop based economy.  This pandemic has brought to light broader issues about work, pay equity and the wealth gap that have long been ignored by those who control the levers of our neoliberal capitalistic economy.  The question is not 'does working remotely work'? but is our economic system working for all of us not just the very wealthiest and privileged."

Even though they are highly intelligent and mostly very competent speakers, the lack of shared subtle verbal gambits and cues, along with odd sentence cadences and pronunciation are all in play without the benefit of non-verbal communication and true eye contact. Remote conferencing often means a very difficult struggle to get their meaning and develop rapport."
2020-06-29 17:33,"I think the key word here is 'trust'. Do you trust your employees? Do you trust yourself to be as productive working from home? I also don't think you can develop that trust until you have worked from home.
The truly successful WFH organizations will be the ones that develop trust over time and refine the approach depending on the role and location of the individuals. The blanket WFH or WFO policy won't be the solution moving forward."
2020-06-29 17:34,"If working from home on Fridays turns Fridays into three-day weekends, then you may need to rethink who you're hiring, your team's dynamics, expectations, etc.  I don't believe that people only work when they are being monitored and watched."
2020-06-29 17:39,"In the 1990s I worked from home and loved it. I went to the office and customers’ sites as needed, but spent ‘office time’ at home. When I moved to another position, I was no longer allowed to from home, even though the tasks I was required to do suited an home office well.  I realized a couple of things. First, supervisors often don’t know how to manager off-site employees. Second, some people need the social aspects of the workplace to do their best work, most whom freely admit it."
2020-06-29 17:39,"I worked remotely 3 days a week for several years before I retired. I came to my desk 2 days each week, ostensibly so my bosses could lay eyes on me. Since I was leading a virtual team scattered across the country and we spent hours doing group work in telecons, it didn’t really matter where I or anyone sat. 

What really mattered to us was that we came together physically a few times a year to have mental pictures of one another.... And at the end of each milestone, we were on track to deliver."
2020-06-29 17:42,"This article is spot-on. Creative productivity--the creation of new ventures, new ideas, and new frameworks--has essentially dropped to zero at our company in the past three months. At the same time, new employees feel totally disconnected. Connections have been lost. Some individual contributors who thrive on ""inbox > outbox"" work have increased their productivity. I'm talking database administrators, help desk people, ""email managers"". But, with the loss of creative new ideas, their inboxes will be increasingly empty. This work-from-home stuff can't end soon enough."
2020-06-29 17:46,"A remote employee is no different than an employee working in a different office, and that's commonplace for big companies.  At Facebook we frequently had VC meetings with people in different buildings, since the campus is so large.  Pre-Covid there was also a lot of travel between offices to take care of things that are better done in person.  Presumably remote employees would also fly in pretty frequently when travel picks up again.  This really isn't as big of a transition as people are making it out to be.  The only real complications are tax and benefit related."
2020-06-29 17:47,"Ah, the serendipitous hallway conversation: that cliché invariably pops up every time an executive has to justify making employees waste an hour a day commuting to an office to do a job that could be done perfectly well from home. The problem with this mythical hallway chat is that it excludes any teammate who didn't happen to be strolling down the hall at that moment. Teams wind up making decisions with input from whoever is around—not whoever actually needs a say or has something important to contribute. It's no way to run a business. 

Plus, by 4:00 everyone's eyeing the rush-hour traffic maps trying to get out before their commute goes from bad to horrible.

It's bad enough when insecure executives needlessly force everyone into an office at great cost to their time, productivity, and family life. It's inexcusable when the office is a hot zone with a virus that has no vaccine or cure."
2020-06-29 17:48,"The article ignore that fact that one of the reasons working from home is working well right now because there is nothing else we really can do. What option do we have but to work while stuck at home  No kids soccer game to be at , no errands to run, no unexpected visitors dropping by.     It is easy to work from home when all possible distraction is removed.  Will it be as easy when the complexity of a full life resumes ?"
2020-06-29 17:49,"After the Northridge quakein '94, I was forced to telecommute due to a some day collapses.
I was the only one of 100 employees in that condition.
In spite of religiously walking at 8am into my ""home office"", the disengagement off office politics and elbow rubbing ended up costing my job after 8 months.
I hope that those facing the challenge, do so as a team and that my words here can be of any help."
2020-06-29 17:53,"Work from home helps people because they don't have to spend gasoline, they don't have to waste hours inside their vehicles every day. They avoid accidents, traffic congestion, and live less stressing lives. In addition if they don't have to leave early in the morning, and arrive late in the evening, they can dedicate more time to their families. Just to mention a few advantages. Supervision is very easy nowadays. You can control hour of arrival to the desk, design an adequate daily report, including measurable objectives. And create all the controls you need.  With less traffic, the atmosphere is more clean, and the need for parking spaces is less important. Yes, many buildings will be empty, but we could use them to create housing for homeless people. Sales Departments are used to remotely control sales persons. Office buildings were created by rich guys, such as John Rockefeller, because they helped them to get richer. Skyscrapers and oil were the origin of great wealth. It's time to change."
2020-06-29 17:53,"This article is rich in anecdotes, but it fails to examine the quantifiable impact of the moving to/from remote working. Aetna, Best Buy, Bank of America, Yahoo, AT&T, and Reddit all pulled back on telecommuting, so what was the impact on their bottom line? How did their performance compare to their competitors before and after the switch? Just because companies made a decision does not mean it was the correct decision or that it was made for the correct reasons. 

Furthermore, it does not examine how the changes were made. Did companies simply cut people loose without creating a communication and accountability structure suitable for a remote working environment? Did workers have the technology they need at home? Did anyone try to measure the extent of collaborating in the office beyond planned meetings, and develop ways to provide a similarly collaborative environment in a remote setting?

A true analysis of the feasibility of remote working should address these points."
2020-06-29 18:01,"A number of years ago, a few people in our office worked a four day work week, all from home. They could accomplish at home in four days, what those remaining in the office could accomplish in five. After this revelation, the majority of us were then permitted to work  from home. Productivity demands are now exceedingly high, because our employer knows there’s no distractions or commute to deal with. My employer’s expectations can no longer be met in an eight hour work day, so the time previously spent commuting is now spent working (which was their intention, no doubt). Seems like many employers are now starting to catch on to what mine already knew, and if they’re like my employer, they’ll be expecting more from their staff, not less"
2020-06-29 18:06,"I started working from home full-time 6 years ago, and I managed a small team of people also working remotely. While I missed shooting the breeze with my colleagues, I found that I was able to get much more work done in less time at home. That's MORE work in LESS time. I also had no problem keeping track of my team. We'd have short weekly calls where we discussed the goals and deadlines for the week, and then we were all free to do our work on our own, without anyone breathing down our necks, and without an hour-long subway ride/drive/whatever each way.

Obviously the ability to work remotely depends on the industry, and to some extent the individual, but in my own small experience, I think the positives greatly outweigh any negatives. I also find that those who fear remote work the most tend to be managers, not the workers themselves. We know we can do it--go ahead and trust us."
2020-06-29 18:07,"I would point out that Richard, in the story, clearly had either no clue as to how to manage remote workers, or had workers that were just not up to it.  Most likely the employees were provided little to no training in time management and in good remote work habits.  

A couple years ago I found myself in a new job shortly after I had some major injuries, and could not come in every day.  I made a point of keeping in close contact with my manager by phone, texting and email, providing him status updates regularly.  Eventually, for other reasons, I wound myself working from home 3 days per week.  By that time many of the firm's conference rooms finally had remotely accessible video conferencing, and many employees had web cams at home and on their work PC's.  It worked well as long as I had a manager who was committed to it working just as much as I was.  And it allowed me lots of flexibility - if I had a doctor's appointment, for instance, I scheduled around it.  I eliminated 4 hours per day of recruiting, and typically worked for at least half of those saved hours, if not more.  The key was good communication and careful scheduling.  Our Outlook calendars made it clear when people were or were not available.

It all worked very well until I got a different manager, one who can barely communicate face to face, let alone over video, phone email or text.  That doesn't work.  

Done properly, wfh can be extremely effective.  But it takes effort."
2020-06-29 18:09,"One thing the pandemic has shown is that people CAN work from home, and productivity is often much higher.  As an introvert, I am much more effective at home, in my safe place, without the mindless distractions and annoyances of the workplace.  

The light bulb that is also turning on is the cost savings that can come from less office space required to keep a company going.  Remote work is not for every business, but for many it can work very well.  There are positives too like reduced traffic and pollution."
2020-06-29 18:10,"What a bunch of bologna’s this article is

Working from home means no commuting, no time space on the road, traffic or environmental pollution and rush hour subway, especially in nyc that is already maxed out. 1, 7, 6 L train lines just aren’t realistic post pandemic when it’s full capacity. They are already troubled with over capacity for years. Why then it’s important to be in the office when jobs are getting done at home with the help of technology. 
People can move further away from congested cities and make more affordable rent or buy homes. That’s a possibility.  City real-estate industry might be scared but they are charging too much for rent. This might be a change to balance out this unscrupulous system. Sounds like a win win. 
Maybe we need to micro manage CEOs time what they are doing at home on Fridays?!"
2020-06-29 18:16,"I am not sure that I understand the arguments against working from home.

Some 30 years ago, I worked in IT at Mobil.  As an ""experiment"" my group was given dial up terminals (2400 baud!)  Every Thursday morning we had a status meeting.  The only question was, where were your tasks vs. deliverables.  If someone was in the office and wanted to explore Grand Central Station or go to a doctor's visit, no one checked.  Or if someone's child had an activity at school and stayed home, who cared.  Before we got the remote terminals and after, the only thing that counted as the Thursday status meeting.  But with terminals, people might work until 2 AM instead of staying late for an hour or two in the office to get the job done."
2020-06-29 18:19,"This article squarely pins the blame for the failure of remote work on employee's lack of adherence to a structured workday, without asking whether employers might have been part of that same problem.  A huge issue for employees working from home is that employers treat them as constantly on call, often expecting them to work illegal overtime. Employers hold a tremendous amount more power in this situation -- especially now."
2020-06-29 18:22,"This is an article about management failure, not failure of a means to getting work done. Some employees are liberated and productive when allowed to work remotely; others are unable to manage themselves. A good manager can regulate both without turning the “natural” into a workaholic who never unplugs and the easily distracted/unmotivated/unproductive remote worker into a productive team member. And yes, creating and managing virtual teams is not the same as in an office environment."
2020-06-29 18:29,"Managers will be obsolete eventually, and remote work ignites this fear. It became clear recently listening to an executive friend discuss the water cooler theory of enlightenment that Melissa Mayer espoused this type of thinking is a byproduct of hierarchical legacy management styleS. Successful remote working isn’t successful by Magic, it requires a whole new framework  about work and accountability, not spyware. Agreed with others that working from home can be more productive and offer other benefits as well."
2020-06-29 18:34,"I've loved working remotely during the pandemic. It's been a privilege to explore my productivity without being tied to a typical ""9 to 5"" schedule. When I sit down to do my work, I am more focused and present precisely because I haven't been tied to a computer all day long like in the past."
2020-06-29 18:38,"IBM lost a lot of quality employees when it cancelled remote work.  It hasn't done very well since - the stock has been flat while the market has been on a tear.

Offices are necessary for managers who are incapable of actually managing, and need the power trip of having everyone under their thumb.  Good managers know how to get things done whatever the structure, and good employees recognize and respond to that."
2020-06-29 18:41,"Remote work is not right for every person or every role, but for those for whom it is a good match, it can be wonderful. I have worked remotely in a full-time salaried position for 14 years. I have many responsibilities and deadlines and I am held accountable for them. My boss supports me, challenges me, and mentors me, but does not micromanage. She doesn’t need to because I have proven myself to be self-directed, creative, and productive. My work won three industry awards last year. And I have excellent relationships with leaders and colleagues within the organization—an organization that, by the way had a culture that normalized and embraced remote work long before the pandemic. So please don’t tell me remote work doesn’t work. When executed thoughtfully it can work beautifully."
2020-06-29 18:46,I could go on and on about working from home;  basically I love it.  But it's made me realize something. DRIVING stresses you out;  and is probably a significant factor in why so many have high blood pressure.
2020-06-29 18:46,"It is possible that this corporate-centric article gets the cause and effect wrong.  Remote workers may be feel less loyal to the company because they are remote.  They may be remote because they are less loyal to the company, because the company has not fostered or rewarded loyalty, and that's why they want to be remote."
2020-06-29 18:51,"This is such a bad headline for the article. Technology has changed - there is no ""long unhappy history of working from home"" that applies today, now, because the technology has changed so much even in the last 5 years. 

Today now, we have Slack, we have Zoom, we have Teams. There is no issue with working remotely. It's commonly done and opens up your hiring options to people you might not have otherwise considered.

""Decades of setbacks suggest"" .. jeez, technology changes, get with the program."
2020-06-29 18:51,"I worked from home the last 4 years of a career that spanned nearly 40 years.  The job was rather high stress with the need to work long hours and I was happy to be able to work from a quiet peaceful place.  I think I had a very positive experience for several reasons. My management insured that I knew their expectations and provided me with all of the equipment and software available to allow me to produce a thoroughly researched product in the most efficient way. They made very sure that I knew I was considered every bit as valuable as my ""in-office"" colleagues.  After a bit of trial and error my organization established communication practices for the work at home staff to make certain we were well informed. I also had an ace-in-the-hole as my dog shepherded me up to the home office by 6:30 every morning right after our morning walk.   And while things were not always perfect overall I was more productive and happier than I had been in a long while. Perhaps best for my circumstance was that it was a wonderful way to transition to retirement. I don't believe I would have been happy working entirely from home when I was younger but I have no regrets that I ended my career working from home."
2020-06-29 18:56,"The key here is supervision. All my supervisors are lazy and not qualified to be a supervisor. It is very easy to check productivity nowadays with technology. For example, call center representative- you can check how many calls a day, how long is a call, personal/business calls etc. All calls are recorded. Or daily reports about work done  is also a solution. My work computer is monitored and location is tracked and I don’t mind at all because I do my job from 9-5 home and love it. I don’t waste 4 hours daily commuting with dirty trains and it is much less traffic in the city. I agree there always be bad apples, a person who disappears for the day and then blames it on technology or WiFi. So again if manager keeps records ,he/she will notice patterns. Not to mention rent- how much our government pays to lease long-term in the city! Working from home is our future !! Huzzah!"
2020-06-29 19:00,"The societal benefit of some staff WFH cannot be overlooked. Removing x number of cars from the roads and x number of people from public transit has a huge positive impact -- on air quality, on  less crowded conditions, and on the mental health of both those who WFH and those essential workers whose lives are improved by better commutes. In CA, I hope governor newsom will take bold steps through mandates and incentives, to keep WFH going."
2020-06-29 19:01,"Yahoo ordered their workforce back to the office. Did it help? 

You cannot will people to work just by looking at them while they sit at their desks. 

Companies that have an engaged workforce whom they can trust will do well wherever employees work; companies that are in conflict with their workforce will flounder, no matter where employees work."
2020-06-29 19:02,"The examples of failures turns this article into a joke. Did you really think IBM would figure out working from home?  

Have you ever visited the Linux OS campus in California? If you answered yes, you are lying, it does not exist.  

First, for a company to be successful with working from home they have to be all in and change their entire operations to be telecommuting first.  Second,  the type of business has to be telecommuting friendly, such as, everyone does most of their work on computers and has meetings, not really dealing with anything physical. Third, you have the hire differently, you want people that are productive working from anywhere. Fourth, you can have a campus but only for people that do not want to work from home and make it optional.  Fifth, you need a pandemic to force everyone to try telecommuting and figure out all the kinks.  As you can see you have to change almost every aspect of how you run your business to make it work. This would never would have happened pre-Covid-19, companies had to justify spending all their money on huge campuses.  Sixth, the communication technology has to be awesome and it is getting there.

Working from home enables employees to reclaim all the commute time, better for their health, it is better for the environment, it is going to prove employees are more productive, and companies will save a tremendous amount of money from no rent.  I would hate to be in commercial real-estate."
2020-06-29 19:02,"I don’t think employers should make long- term decisions based on the fact productivity was high the first few months.  First, especially for non-parents (or at least non parents of young children) there was literally nothing else to do- no distractions, etc.  Second, I think over time it’s hard to stay engaged when you aren’t feeling part of a team effort and don’t have much contact with people.  I’m having this problem myself.  I was extremely productive the first three months but have been having more and more trouble focusing, staying engaged, etc."
2020-06-29 19:05,"You couldn’t be more wrong! What about all the companies like Moz, Basecamp and many more that have been doing this successfully for decades Referring to Yahoo, is a joke. They never had control of that situation. 

The future is decentralized. 

Many people that write stories like this have outset motives. They want the offices, the commuters the real estate to keep bustling to ensure business stays as usual. 

The future has very little offices and the pandemic is helping to usher this in sooner."
2020-06-29 19:06,"What is wrong with this writer--and everyone else who discusses remote vs. in-person work without noting the thing of primary importance to us all: the environment?

Since we woke up to the fact that we are destroying our planet, we've gone back and forth over electric cars vs. gasoline vs. ethanol vs. diesel. We've signed up and dropped out of pacts. We've tried to persuade companies to reduce packaging and emissions by just a little. And our impact has been minimal.

We've discovered over these past few months that most work can be done from home--without daily commute. Businesspeople have discovered that it's not necessary to fly around the world just to convince a potential client that they are ""sincere"" (which apparently is a thing in the business world, with the result that thousands of massively polluting planes are put into the sky every year--for no real reason at all), but that the same transaction can happen just as well over Zoom. Etc. 

And, as a result, our air is cleaner, smog is way down, kids in India, we are told, can see distant mountains for the first time in their lives, wildlife is rebounding, roadkill is less. We might be going stir crazy from having to isolate, but it's safe to say that basically no one misses the daily grind of leaping out of bed every morning at exactly the same time, sitting in traffic on the same commute, every day. People have started to notice nature more, even.

Wake up, everybody. This is our chance. Can we please seize it?"
2020-06-29 19:10,"Working remotely has its place but not as a daily arrangement. It can be an effective way to reduce questionable travel expenses. I once hosted a group of 8-10 higher level managers for a 4 hour meeting at an international worksite at a cost of $8000 per person. Believe me, none of them needed to be there."
2020-06-29 19:11,"The nature of my auditing and investigative work, (which I performed for 40+ years and am now retired)  required me to work in the field 65%, my office 5% and at home 30%.  My boss, who was located 125 miles away, assigned my work and expected me to get the tasks completed in a timely manner regardless of where the actual work took place.  We normally spoke to each other once or twice a week, however I only actually visited his office once per year for a yearly evaluation.   

The key to working from home is you have to be a self starter and seek to structure your day to get things accomplished both short term and long term.    I rarely went to my office, as I could not get anything productive done there.  There was socializing, gossip and office drama,but little actual work produced.  

My focus was on getting the work done regardless of where I actually conducted the job.   It is a management issue to monitor performance, and if someone is not a self starter while working from home they were probably just as unproductive working in the office."
2020-06-29 19:16,"History shows that it takes 30 to 40 years for a new, almost magic technology to really start working. Telecommuting is no exception. I predict that 50 percent of office space will be empty in 5 years, and that commercial realtors better find a new business."
2020-06-29 19:20,"What Mr. Streitfeld neglects to consider is that today's world is nothing like it was decades ago, going back to 1985 when the birth of the World Wide Web was still 6 years away, VCRs were either Beta or VHS, and rural telephones party lines still existed. 

In 2020, not only do we have readily-available technology that wasn't even dreamed about in 1985, but we have COVID-19 that is ruling the roost.  As office buildings reopen, how many workers will want to risk their health by riding public transit into a potentially crowded high rise office building?  How much money can be saved by companies simply by allowing workers to remotely work from home?

I've worked from a home office for 17 years.  Best career move I've ever made, both for the best use of my time and increased productivity.  During the COVID-19 Pandemic, I've surprisingly found Video Meetings to be more efficient than in-person meetings.

Businesses and governments can't place the primary focus on the pre-COVID19 past, and the past decades, when making decisions moving forward.  Rather, today's ""New Normal"" and available technology must be considered first for best practices moving forward."
2020-06-29 19:21,"True.  We cannot move effortlessly to remote working.

People will, and do, slack off.  Data coming in from colleges tell us that professors who started teaching online - not all maintained any rigor.  Learning, to discomforting levels, collapsed.

But people slack off at work too.  

What I am suggesting is the slacking off, and finding ways to avoid work is a key problem.  In seat, in office, online, all of the above."
2020-06-29 19:21,"Depends on the job too. I'm a software engineer who's supposed to be writing code. Being in an office has often been useless with the exception of certain meetings. Working on projects with people around the world means you're using Zoom anyway. Regardless of where you're sitting there are expectations to develop and upload changes on a near daily basis. It becomes plainly obvious if someone isn't keeping up, which is why it's a stressful profession."
2020-06-29 19:23,"This really is a matter of ""it depends"": on the organization, function, manager and employee. 

For me, in my 30+ career in publishing, academia and libraries I've done about 1/2 in the workplace and 1/2 remotely. The times I've worked remotely I've been left to my own devices and not micro managed. If not distracted, I am much more productive at home, getting about 8 hours work done in 5 or less. I also enjoy making my own schedule of what to do when. But it's true I feel less connected to the organization, and need to make up for less social interaction. If I was a manager, I would give my employees a choice, and then just set clear and agreed upon goals to meet."
2020-06-29 19:23,"A key dynamic is trust between employer and employee. If an employer is always suspicious and don't trust their staff, they same sentiment works in advance. Companies that work to build and hold trust with their employees don't have to worry about what's happening at home."
2020-06-29 19:24,"I have been working from home since March 16. I am more productive, less stressed, can listen to whatever music I want to, do not have to deal with traffic, and am in the best shape I have been in a long time. I am also 100% getting my work done every day as I would in the office."
2020-06-29 19:25,"I think that we need to deal with working from home in an effort to stop the relentless   pollution of the earth caused by cars and commuting..I think all the trivial problems the companies might have with worker commitment, etc., can be dealt with, must be dealt with, to get our pollution of the earth by commuter traffic under control..What is the price? some capitalist profit/company time..What is at stake? the fate of the earth."
2020-06-29 19:29,"Thirty years ago I had my own business working from home as a typesetter. It was boring work, and I had trouble forcing myself to do it except on short deadline.

Twenty-five years later, I work as a data analyst, really enjoy my work, and there is absolutely no reason for me to do it in an office.

It's not for everybody, and it's not good for all types of work. You have to invest in your own workstation, but that can be a boon if your employer doesn't provide them to begin with unless you're disabled.

I was judged as much on my appearance (older, obese woman) as my ability to show up and warm a chair. Working from home has been transformative, I am treated respectfully and fairly, judyed on the quality of my work more than anything else...my annual reviews are positive. I hope I never again see the inside of an office, and all its attendant gossip, cliques and infighting."
2020-06-29 19:30,"Financial, cultural and technological considerations should form the strategy for companies determining where there employees should base their workplace. It's interesting that the article referenced companies that started and abandoned remote working arrangements within the span of a few years and all before the latest technological advancements that are making remote work possible on the collaborative, creative, functional and financial metrics. Throw in this pandemic (and future global disease-driven catastrophes), as well as tipping-point migration to green environments and you have a more workable and sustainable path to remote working as the primary workspace rationale."
2020-06-29 19:40,"All white collar work is not created equal.  I teleworked for the last eight years of my career before retiring.  My work involved planning and analysis for sites all over the USA.  Other members of my work groups were similarly spread all over the country.  We would not have been together in the same space even if all of us had commuted to the closest office every day, and all we needed to get our work done was a computer, VPN, and telephone.  Regular face-to-face meetings a few times a year, either at conferences many of us were attending or at work group meetings, helped maintain the bonds we needed to work together effectively.

It appears Streitfelds' experience is in IT; maybe his observations work in that industry.  But it's ridiculous to assume it applies to everyone else as well."
2020-06-29 19:41,I’ve been working from home for 15 years and my sparse trips to the office only reinforce what a waste of time and money maintaining office spaces is.  I’m convinced that the only people supporting the “work from home doesn’t work” agenda would be those that rent out office space.
2020-06-29 19:44,"I've just celebrated my fourth year as a remote worker. I'm a software engineer who is also a licensed architect (for buildings) in the state of Washington.    

I worked over a decade in an office environment and much prefer remote work. In the past, I have even experienced a viscous middle-management component remotely and would much prefer to deal with it remotely. It just takes some strategy, proactivity and gusto. I am not averse to middle management, I'm just saying tough situations can be dealt with remotely if you're doing your part to be an honest, contributing employee. 

Your good work is the new form of trust currency and that, to me, is way better than overly blending socialization and work to form a hybrid version of trust based on hanging out and work ethic. Though I have never been fired or laid off,  I have many times witnessed people invest years of their time into the social fabric of an office and then lose their job only to be without a support network in a new city.

Remote work works best when the social component of your life outside of work is robust. I have my spouse and kids at home, musician friends I write music with, and a church family that I also invest in. 

I am crazy passionate about my work, but it is just that... work. If your work makes you answer emails/slack after hours and uses leverage to overtake the rest of your life, I would call that remote slavery... not remote work. In that case, an office might be better :)"
2020-06-29 19:45,"Telecommuting has been around a lot longer than this article stated. As long ago as 1980, when I was staying as a tourist in San Francisco, I met a guy who had a phone terminal connected by one of those rubber-cup phone modems. 
I asked him what he was doing and he said it was his job. Every morning he logged in and downloaded some sort of customer data. Then he'd log out and process it. Later, he'd log back in and send it as a file.
He explained to me that he was travelling around the USA staying wherever he felt like staying. I was amazed. This was six years before I built my first IBM compatible PC in the UK and ran a FIDO bulletin board. Six years!"
2020-06-29 19:47,"The headline does not reflect reality. Given the success of The Office, most people appreciate how bizarre workplace environments can be and how working remotely is quite beneficial. Healthier in the cold season even without a pandemic. Less irritating, too.
Anyone ever notice two office pals who convene each morning in a nearby cube and chat for 30 or 40 minutes? You can’t help but notice - yet the manager doesn’t seem to. Or the manager is pals with them. Either way, you hunker down to concentrate on your work and occasionally become aware – why, they’re still at it!  Best to dismiss such blatant abuse of trust. Best to work in your home office, producing what you’re expected to produce and being worthy of trust."
2020-06-29 19:48,"I’ve been working from home for close to 10 years. I work with team members around the world, so there’d be no point in going to an office. In my opinion, the pros of working remotely far outweigh the cons. With today’s online collaboration tools, there’s very little office work that can’t be accomplished at home. 
Employers who complain about people not getting their work done likely aren’t very good managers no matter where they’re located. If you set expectations upfront and have regular status checks, productivity shouldn’t be a problem."
2020-06-29 19:49,"The topic of working remotely has always suffered from bad press, most of which springs from confusing symptoms with causes.  Data have shown since the 1990s that people who work from home are at least as productive as those who work in an office, more so as the open office has made focused work less workable.  For as long as the data have shown better productivity, leaders who might lack physical evidence of their own role (where are they?), or who might be forced to measure people on results rather than just talk about it, have resisted.  The resistance usually takes the form of asserting ""it doesn't work"" with no evidence, or cherry-picking the evidence for the people who can't handle working independently.  By the way, that's not a remote work problem; it's a recruiting problem. If you can't trust the people you hire to give it their all, hire different people"
2020-06-29 19:51,"These are companies that have blamed remote work for their problems, but there is no proof that remote work had anything to do with their revenue losses during those times. Let's look at IBM. It has had declining revenue every year since 2012, except for 2018, in which growth was only 0.57% vs 2017. It declined 3.07% in 2019. They have been offering remote work since the 1980s, and were up to 40% of their workforce in 2009. 2011 was the highest revenue in company history, and 2012, while a decline, was the third highest. If remote work were the problem, then declining revenue should have started when at it's peak, and stopped when it was ended.

Remote work is a convenient scapegoat for a declining company. Best Buy's main cause of declining revenue was internet shopping, Yahoo's main cause of declining revenue was Google, but blaming remote workers was easier than correctly indicting management's decisions that made them unable to compete in a changing market.

While the article points out a handful of failures, it does not mention how many companies have tried remote work, and ignores any that have had success, numbers that are critical to accurately determining the success or failure of the concept as a whole."

2020-06-29 20:00,"Here's the thing: Working from home isn't a silver bullet. It's not all or nothing. Some people have the discipline (and home work environment) to make it work, others do not.  You gain some peace and quiet; you lose the small social interactions that often fuel teams. Etc.

I think it can probably be made to work, but not simply by telling people to stay home. It takes more effort to keep people connected and keep conversations flowing. You need to teach practices that enable effective remote work.

Also, the WFH anecdotal evidence right now is benefiting from the fact that employees already have established relationships with each other. What's the experience like for the new employee or (God help 'em) new college grad? Rough and isolating.

I like working from home. It's convenient for me. However, I think a mix of WFH and regular in-office interaction is far superior."
2020-06-29 20:01,"Ugh. I accomplish more work at home than I did at the office. Plus I get more sleep and the laundry doesn’t pile up. This means that my weekends are real weekends, without the slam of ALL the household chores to finish, probably for the first time ever in my working life. What is the deal with people who think WFH = vacation? Stop that. You’ll ruin it for those of us who feel like they have their lives back."
2020-06-29 20:03,"A fair number of people at my company have been working at home for over a decade since they moved the company to a new city. Up until the coronavirus crisis, these people were slightly marginalized because people simply didn't see them in the office and think of them immediately when they had an issue. Since the crisis, everyone has been forced to work at home and it's really leveled the playing field. Now we all interact on Teams on a frequent basis and the previous remote people are just as close as the rest of us. So perhaps it's sort of an all-or-nothing game, where the best performance happens when everyone is working remote and we approach interactions through that lens."
2020-06-29 20:05,"I've been WFH since mid-March having last done this in the post 9/11 era.  My feelings about it are exactly the same nearly 20 years later.  There are some pros (more sleep, time to exercise and time with family).  The cons for me are that I enjoy the interactions with my co-workers.  

However the bigger con for the company is the loss of the corporate culture.  I work for a successful, 100 person company and we value the culture and the people we employ.  It is that culture which enabled us to move into the remote WFH situation so quickly and easily.  We know one another and trust each other even though we're away from the office.  That's helped us to keep up productivity and get projects done on a timely basis.  Over time though, that corporate culture is going to erode if we stay remote.  We'll lose the occasional employee and have to replace them with someone who knows nothing about us or the values of the company.  While I could see some kind of hybrid structure when (if) things get back to normal, I just don't buy into the notion that you can abandon all those bonds you develop when you work together."

The 40 hour work week is an antiquated notion that previous generations of economists and even business leaders assumed would be diminished by now- it is just reliance on the usual “that’s how we’ve always done it” mindset that keeps it alive today. It has been shown that office workers are actually only productive for just a few hours out of an 8 hour day, and that especially applies to upper management who basically make some phone calls, attend a pointless meeting or two, go out to lunch, and call it a day. Perhaps it’s management’s understanding of how little they themselves do that leads to their suspicions about remote employees. Poor leadership is the actual issue here."

I don't work any longer but I spent over 4 decades in the oil patch - all over the world.  Some locations in Africa - it was necessary for some to work remotely, health, security etc issues.

Some worked remotely - in other places - because they also ”worked” on other projects.

Now, I like being in an office - though I never had less than a perfectly good place to live.

I reject this remote working if you are in America or parts where health and security - for the most part are not issues.

At least thru my experience, I found remote workers 'remote' from work and more importantly connectivity that you find in an office.

I think this ”bumping into someone” by chance - which generates some important solutions - simply can't happen remotely.

And I dare say - humans are born to take advantage - trust is not the issue.

Working from home is not easy with kids but it is possible, you save on commuting time and you do get to spend more time with your kids (and that is the cherry on top).

Sometimes, I get the strong sense the NYT writers either dont have kids or just dont understand how the typical American family survives and thrives.

Understanding how the American middle class lives and the challenges they face is clearly not the strength of the journalists that live in our major cities.  Having lived in Ohio and Michigan, I have met Americans who are facing challenges with strength and grace.  And no, they dont complain about their Zoom connection or whether that chicken breast is organic or not.  The Times seems out of touch with reality of many Americans and still cant understand how our President was elected.  A week long visit to Toledo, Ohio or another swing state city might be eye opening to your journalists.  And please stop complaining about those of us who are working from home.

I've been a full time remote worker for 7 years now, and I'm FAR more productive at home than when I had to go to an office every day.  The only reason remote work doesn't work, is because a company's leadership isn't willing to make the changes necessary for remote work to be successful.  That means investing in the proper tools for workers to stay connected (and extremely easy thing to do these days), and having management that actually trusts their employees.

Lest we forget, once the current pandemic is behind us, we still have to address global warming, and people commuting in their vehicles to work every day is a HUGE source of pollution.  Remember how nice and empty the roads were when everything was shut down?  That can be a reality.

I travelled more than I wished because the culture demanded in person meetings. Even then, technology expanded communication and exposed superfluous layers of middle management. The office bullpen is a vestigial holdover of the industrial revolution's factory floor.

There are various reasons for why they didn't, even though we have remote access to the company services via VPN, and after all is said and done, as an engineer I am really a professional typist. And I can do that typing from home as well as I can at the office. I did suggest during one of the last weekly company meetings that I would like the option to work from home to help my wife with our kid, and that suggestion was met with stony silence. 

I will say that our office layout is socially distant by accident -- cubicles are large enough and everybody has plenty of space. And everyone is wearing masks.

Part of the problem with remote work at my company is that we do manufacturing in house and that can't be done at home. And for me to replicate a lab set-up with necessary equipment would be difficult. (Plus I'd need space at home for it.) So these are the real factors against work from home.

I will say that I would _love_ to work from home more often, simply because I can put on a record while I'm working and I don't need to hear all of the equipment humming in the background while I'm thinking."

Long term, we need employers to offer *more* WFH options -- not just to keep the pandemic under control (office workers are the *least* necessary in an office) but also because there are people who thrive under WFH.

Introverts, people with ADHD, people who have SAD and thrive in the daylight of their home offices. People who are caregiving someone who just needs a person at home (say, an 11 year old on school break or a parent with mild dementia) and not ongoing care. People who want the freedom to live near family or somewhere affordable. People who want to skip an outrageous commute.

The current circumstances are a deeply flawed experiment with working from home. We are here because a crisis forced it. Many of us are working in dire or uncertain business conditions. There’s a lot of incentive to give extra or say everything is going great because employees are fearful of losing their jobs.

A survey of staff at the 450-person firm I work for revealed a strong majority value physical presence in the office for work collaboration, professional development and, yes, socializing. We are managing it because we are in a crisis and we have to. If people are missing something they say they need it stands to reason we will see negative effects at some point."

Working from home helps alleviate lifes unexpected curve balls.  Having the option to work at home a few days a week can help.
Otherwise permanently working from home is a terrible idea.  The company culture will suffer greatly from working at home.  Not being around other employees, Managers, directors and VPs can be detrimental in so many ways.  Small talk humanizes the workplace. It helps everyone appreciate one another. Especially important during those times when downsizing may occur.  Have you seen Bob? What has he done for me lately. Might be better if the bosses can say, I know Bob has had a rough patch lets let him take care of his personal issues. Or that mistake can be corrected and won't happen again. We know he is competent.  May not be the same for the remote worker.  What was he thinking. We never see the guy.  

Then there are the serendipitous moments that will not exist. Talking aimlessly by the coffee machine someone starts discussing an issue.  A person from another group overhears and says I have the same problem. Let's work this out together.  Or someone jumps in with the comment, I figured out the solution let's discuss.

Arguments for WFH are huge benefits to time & energy saved due to commute, diminished effects of office politics, better focus and accountability and above all, overall employee satisfaction due to sense of freedom and flexibility. 

The solution can’t be one size fits all. It also depends on company culture. Not all roles require the serendipitous creativity which is overrated. Just like mixed economy, we just need to flip the current 1-2 WFH days a week to 1-2 in-office-days per week solution.

It is widely believed the move was driven, in part, by a new executive in the company who envisioned running her marketing staff like a Silicon Valley start-up -- but more generally by the company's recognition that forcing employees move to within commuting distance of an IBM Cloud hub or lose their jobs was a great way to throw ballast overboard and hire fresh, cheap, young talent en mass. 

As someone who has worked for the company for most of the past 20+ years (most of that time remotely) I can tell you that about 90% of my coworkers were still remote -- by choice - when the pandemic hit.

I remember when IBM still knew how to manage technical teams in person -- I do not believe that is a skill still largely available within our organization. Today's teams manage themselves and report to matrixed, mostly senior, management chains who exist primarily for political, strategic and HR functions. It's a different world than it was before the company sent us all home. Not a worse one -- an evolved one. And we are, actually, incredibly diverse and global.

2020-06-29 20:34,"I was let go after 20 years with a large, multinational company.  No reason given -- I was blindsided.  I'm a perfect candidate for remote working, and I tried mightily to find such work (proofreading and copyediting).  Not a single company was interested in a remote worker.

Now, I notice that remote jobs are plentiful.  Some companies have realized that this approach saves them money, plus it gives them a deeper pool of top-quality candidates -- highly qualified people who may not wish to relocate.  Like me.  I suppose that Bad Timing is the story of my life!"
2020-06-29 20:49,"Mr. Streitfeld, you failed to backup the attention grabbing headline.  Your argument against WFH boils down to a an interview with a small PR firm and a handful examples going back a decade and including failed companies such as Yahoo!.  You provide no supporting data.

The obvious reason why your cherry picked examples are not relevant is that technology has changed drastically.  Zoom and collaboration tools aside, smart phones didn't even exist during some of his examples.  You acknowledge this point but do not counter it.  Disappointing."
2020-06-29 20:54,"We have not been going to work for a thousand years. We've been going to work since the Industrial Revolution. Prior to that people worked in agriculture or lived above their shops. That kind of inaccuracy, or to be generous, hyperbole, along with an utter avoidance of any opinions or experiences from actual *workers* makes it somewhat difficult to take this article seriously."
2020-06-29 20:54,"The first anecdote is thin and completely unconvincing. This guy says people have to work in the office because on Fridays he couldn't find them leading to slow-downs in projects moving forward? What kind of ridiculousness is this? That sounds like lack of planning, not workers disappearing. I would suggest with diffidence that a major factor for companies weighing the move to virtual offices is their planning capacity. Everywhere I've worked, where planning is poor, the boss needs people around to call on - because the boss has no idea how to plan. In places where planning is strong, you don't need people on five-minute notice; their contributions come in as they were needed thanks to a well thought out and structured plan. In a way, COVID-19 has shown us the companies run by people who do not know how to plan: they are clamoring to get back to the office because they desperately need Janet at 4:55pm on Friday because they simply did not plan well. Mr. Laermer sounds like he falls into this group. Get it together, Richard! Improve your planning and you won't need to chase people down. Good grief."
2020-06-29 20:54,"I was surprised that this article did not include any of the entirely distributed companies that have operated that way for years and have thrived. I am not an expert on any of the companies cited in this article, but my guess that their failure to develop a wholly new culture around work from home led to their negative outcomes. No offense to Best Buy or some of the other companies mentioned here (not exactly bastions of ingenuity), but it stands to reason that they were likely severely limited in their creativity in re-imagining what workplace culture should be like from home.  In designing a WFH culture, if you just try to recreate how you work and interact to the way you would in the office, the employees and managers will be unhappy and the outcomes will be bad, which is likely what most of the companies that have failed.  Anyone who is interested in WFH topic should balance this article with interviews of CEO's of companies where the company culture was built up completely the idea of not having an office. For example, Matt Mullenweg, the founder of Automattic, has thought deeply on this topic and the results are fascinating: e-mail is replaced with blog posts and tags, a global talent pool, and a decision-making process that rewards thoughtful consideration versus being the loudest voice in the room."
2020-06-29 20:58,"My husband's job ordinarily allows him to work from home occasionally.  It's great if I'm unavailable and he needs to drive the kids, or we have contractors, or if he's mildly ill with a cold or something minor but contagious.  He'll take a call or VC if necessary but that's the day he catches up on all his paperwork uninterrupted.

I was the Office Lady in a small office and it was non stop email, phone, doorbell, delivery, etc.  We were closed Friday afternoons and we'd save things that needed a couple of hours straight through for those times.  A lot of that could have been done from home, and we did do it that way during a renovation.

I don't see full time or even half time WFH for most jobs, but one or two days a week to do the things you *don't* need to be in the same room for?  Absolutely.

Also to consider, it's not just work from home, it's live at your job.  That's definitely not for everyone."

2020-06-29 21:00,"2 years ago I called Apple Support for Software for help with my iPhone.  I requested a supervisor.  I Spoke with Jason.  After 2-3 minutes he said...”Oh excuse me a moment, I have to let my dog in...”. When he came back to the phone, he said, somewhat defensively, “just so you know...I work from my home, and yes, it is a 5 minute walk to the Atlantic Ocean.  But I worked for 6 years in an office setting, at a cubicle, with no windows.  Then I was promoted to Senior Advisor.  Then I opted to work from home.  So I have paid my dues in an office setting.  Actually I think I am more efficient working from home.  My position does not require in-person interaction with peers or supervisees.   I have great IT support from my employer.  I hear the sea gulls.  I smell the salty breezes.  I have my 30-minute lunch on the beach.  I am inspired to give excellent customer service.  And my dog definitely prefers this arrangement.  Hurricanes are the only downside...”

So, I disagree with this article.  Sometimes working from home is a better choice.  Millions of employees can’t do this.  But Jason was a happy camper.  As was his dog."

If you hire self starters, and pay the proper wage, you’ll find much better productivity, the savings on your brick and mortar will allow you to pay much better wages and to have your pick of the cream of the crop. You have to change the type of people you hire. Lazy, unorganized people can’t cut it from home, but there are a world of people who can. It’s a simple change in the characteristics your looking for. Old school folks like you sure.. it’s your mind set. (I’m 57 so age doesn’t determine your work philosophy) and my business is thriving with 35 of my 40 employees working from home. And the 3 of those 5 have to be on site to handle in person training, the other two simply to have maintain an office for purposes of a training center and a central location for calls, mail and the like.   I’ve been doing this for several years though and I learned it’s a different workforce you need to hire. Again, the information you’ve written is completely erroneous and if you’d do better research you’d find that many spoke, especially this new generation can thrive, be efficient and successful working at home. And you have a much much greater pool of potential employees to choose from since the location of their home has no bearing on who works for me.  But the type of folks you have to watch every day, stand over their shoulder and remind of deadlines.. those folks shouldn’t be under your employ anyway. Wake up... and  Welcome to the new world!"

2020-06-29 21:18,"This is possibly the most anecdotal and poorly researched article that I've read in NYT. In my 20 years of work life, WFH is the best thing that happened in the modern workplace. The very idea honors the fact that we are all competant adults capable of effectively managing our own time. Workers are not all lazy slackers who need constant surveillance to be productive. Last time I checked we are way past the industrial revolution. In the information age, creativity matters most and having worked years in the creative field, it can happen anywhere and it happens best when one is well rested and has autonomy over ones life."

These women find that being home, especially if they have kids, gives them a healthier, well rounded life free of guilt. We should have that option if we wish. 

I’d like to see what exactly these tech companies did when offering work from home options. . They probably didn’t make it very easy to work.  Just guessing."
2020-06-29 21:21,"So if there is all of this productivity and increased innovation from being in the office, where is it? I'm reminded of Paul Volcker saying that the only innovative product he's seen in the banking industry over the last thirty years was the ATM Machine.  Is FB innovative,  And how has Yahoo been lately. IBM forced people to go to their offices hoping a lot of them would quit. And has IBM done better. Nope. Ask all of these people who say that we need everyone back in the office how many have outsourced work overseas. 

Laying people off . Sending their jobs overseas, paying CEO's  a hundred times what their average worker makes also makes people feel disconnected . And I don't see anyone trying to put an end to those."
2020-06-29 21:22,"I have worked in the world of selling technology to organizations large and small for over 25 years. I could not disagree with the premise of this article more. Organizations of all sizes were making a significant moves toward the remote work force even before the pandemic. I know, because it's one of the top conversations we have with our customers. None of them are expecting to have large quantities of people in the office anytime soon. The truth is that if you are a knowledge worker who sits at a desk in front of a computer, there is very little that requires you to be in your organization's office. Your applications, data, IM / Email messaging and VoIP / Video communications can all be provided to you at home. Sure, there are times when it's helpful to be face to face with a teammate or customer but no one needs to commute every day into an office to do the work they can do from home. If you look at the organizations discussed in this article that forced teleworkers to come back into the office, you will find that all are organizations that are in an increasingly steep decline. #workfromhome"

Effective training and collaboration demands interaction with other people, live interactions."
2020-06-29 21:32,"I am fascinated that there was no mention on how to integrate new employees into a group or the company. Maybe my employer is unusual but there is a very strong corporate culture, and as new people join they receive substantial training, both in their jobs and in the company norms. That really ties them into their fellow employees and work group. I just can't imagine doing that over Zoom."
2020-06-29 21:33,"If companies want us to be productive it helps when the space we work in is quiet, properly ventilated, that we have to proper equipment, if we aren't constantly interrupted by meetings, expected to respond instantly to emails or IMs.  It helps if our chairs are comfortable, the computers up to date, and if we aren't  micromanaged.  In other words, we're treated like the valued workers employers claim they consider us to be.  It means that the customer service rep answering the phone should not be forced to rush a customer who needs assistance.  

The wrong metrics are often measured at work.  It's not how quickly you can solve a customer's problems.  It's how patient you can be helping them get what they want.  (It would be nice if customer service reps had more power to help.)  It's not how many meetings you attend that make you good at your job.  It's if you can help solve the problems and, in many ways, working from home is not ideal for that.  

So much of the workday is spent on chasing shaggy dogs.  Quite often it's the C-level people who come up with solutions that have no relevance to the actual work.  They then force them on the rest of us.  In truth, most of those CEOs are overpaid because they don't add much value to the product or the company.  It's become much more obvious to me, working from home, that offices need to be upgraded to be quieter, cleaner, better ventilated, and better lit.  Equally clear is that the equipment needs to be up to date."
2020-06-29 21:39,"Why does it have to be all or nothing with these articles? For some of us, working from home is the best thing that ever happened to us. For others, it's stifling torture. And for a few it's just somewhere in between. 

The ability to focus on work has quadrupled for me. The ease and peace of mind of not having to perform social niceties for psychic vampires is not something I'm willing to give up now. I'm a fast, efficient worker and most of my work was done in the first couple hour of the day, which left me running down the clock. At home, I don't run down the clock, I'm inspired to innovate, use the space and time to come up with new projects and efficiencies. I'm a better employee working from home.   

When this is over and we can safely return, it should be examined logically, by each office and industry. What are the pros and cons? But there's room for everyone and different ways of doing things. Not everyone has to work remote and not everyone has to be in the office. 

But now that we have the option, business would be foolish to deny it to those who thrive at home. And if my office goes back to all from office, with no at home option, I'll start looking for another job."
2020-06-29 21:46,"When we realized we had the opportunity to WFH long term, we bought a larger house with two extra bedrooms as office spaces in a cheaper suburb where we can plant a food garden. So far we've seen our electricity bill shrink compared to when we lived in a condo community. We do have to pay for water and tax but it's still cheaper than when we were renting in the center of an expensive city for the sake of a shorter commute. Our monthly bills are lower, we are eating better, we have more time to relax and improve our living space (therefore increase the value of our entire neighborhood) and our work productivity has gone through the roof. I don't think I can ever revert back to the old way of ""office work"" where we sat in loud open spaces without natural light and feeling guilty every time I have to leave my desk to use the bathroom. That life is not fit for humans. Oh and I am a manager."

2020-06-29 21:53,"Is serendipity, i.e bumping into a colleage at the coffee machine, the lynchpin of all progress? The most creative work takes concentration, lack of distraction and ample free time to think. Onec these conditions are met a chance enounter might lead to breakthroughs but not without serious work being done in a concentrated way before. Look down the list of Mcarthur recipients or any list of highly creative people and ask them how much setting their lives up for chance encounters with their mediocre colleagues is the well spring of great ideas for work. 

Are creativity and productivity not affected by a lack of wage transparency, a lack of paid family leave, health care tied to jobs, gender bias and racisim in the work-place, not to mention that most people cite a bad manager as the top reason for leaving their jobs. Do these forms of toxicity and precarity, ever-present in the American workplace, promote creativity? 

People have performed adequately from home despite childcare duties, despite falling sick from the virus as many have and despite the anxiety of the moment. Could it be because all these factors make a person do no worse than being in their workplace? So, then is it the workplace that has been promoting productivity or has it really been undermining it?"

The best mix for me has been home/ fieldwork and a weekly meeting or two in-person. I once worked for a place that judged us solely by results and in spite of my various teams not being physically in the same place most of the time, we still managed to beat out 32 other similar teams in our region for outcomes and satisfaction. 

One issue also not brought up though with remote work is its impact on more offshoring of jobs. Unlike other countries, the US does not have laws to protect US workers and instead favors companies."

What strucked me (and still does when my primary contact for a gig is a line manager or the like) is how middle-managment has been fighting against homeworking for years: it's like if homeworking works, a part of their duties (watching over people) and salary is not justified anymore.

I have the feeling that the big fight between shareholders and management is precisely there: get rid of the middle managment to get a bigger share.

Get rid of building and infrastructure expenses is a bonus."

It used to be a norm for a company to provide you with a space where you can focus on your work and your team.  If you had to use computer and phone outside the office, company supplied it.  Not anymore.  Workers are expected to donate their own resources (computer, wifi, internet link phone and cellular data) to the company at no charge.

We all like to think of ourselves as special and irreplaceable.  And indeed, there are some folks who are so valuable to their employer's bottom line that if working from home is possible it can be a godsend for both parties.

But a lot of the folk ""working from home"" during Covid are, for want of a more delicate term, simply ""office drudges"".  They are the bookkeepers and clerical staff of the office.  They are the necessary but nearly invisible office ""infrastructure"".  The ""support staff"".

For these people, ""working from home"" during Covid may prove to ultimately be a job killing experience.

Think about what you do when you ""work from home"".  If it's something anyone, anywhere can do then think about this.

How long before your employer realizes it can outsource your job to some place like India?  After all, if the only ""office infrastructure"" required to do your job is an internet connection -- your job could soon be heading overseas.

Don't kid yourselves.  Employers are learning very quickly who's job is easily transferrable to a much cheaper locale and salary base.  The Covid ""work from home"" phenomenon may prove to be a huge laboratory test leading to a major white collar job exporting effort in a short time."

2020-06-29 22:22,"I started working from home since March. I like it. I have saved money on gas, and other incidentals. I have maintained the same routine I hand when communing. All this, I like.

What I don't like is the fact that when you work from home, you ""can't go home"" and leave it all behind.  You must be extremely disciplined to not make work your life. In addition. Unless I am tethered to my coworkers on Skype or zoom or Facetime while working, work distribution is unequally shared. Some are AWOL for hours so I end up picking up the slack. But of course that's a management kink which needs addressing.

Lastly: my family life. Members of the household have routines of their own, which clash, scheduling becomes a challenge.  My last quip at a Zoom meeting I arrived late was "" there was a long backup at the master bathroom"""
2020-06-29 22:26,"I agree that in many jobs, one-on-one discussions, hallway or lunchtime conversations, informal, impromptu meetings, etc. can be a big part of creativity and communication, and facilitate management.

That said, there is only one essential obstacle to recreating that environment in a virtual, work-at-home space, and that is the electronic latency involved in long-distance communications (e.g., across the whole US).

Provided workers are within say a few hundred mile radius, virtually instant communication is possible over the internet, especially if the company pays for enhanced infrastructure for the ""last-mile"" connections to home offices.

If it is necessary to have the equivalent of ""in the office"" interaction for work-at-home employees, then it is up to those who create collaboration software to make this happen. I see no intrinsic reason why it cannot be done well, and possibly allow even more effective interaction than is possible in a physical office."

Thousands and thousands of offices going vacant, and people deciding they don’t need to live in Gotham if they don’t need to work in Gotham.  Real estate has been the straw that stirs this country’s economic drink (as we all learned from the loans and derivatives casino and the subsequent crash of 2008).

You’re being exceptionally productive and will have so much more time for what you really care about. It doesn’t take long before you try to put on your work pants, though, and they don’t come up past your thighs. Panicked, you tell yourself they shrunk in the wash. If you’re partnered up, that partner might be the only adult you see some days, and maybe the only one you talk to, too. When your friends call, you ask what’s up and then laugh instead of joining the conversation because you forget you’re not listening to a podcast. Before the pandemic, you could at least go work in a coffee shop or go to the gym or the grocery store or the pharmacy or Marshall’s. Now that you have everything delivered, good luck getting out.

That meant that you may have worked very successfully for years somewhere, maybe from home and maybe from an office, but now had to MOVE to one of only a few locations like NYC, Raleigh, Austin...  This was actually a move to get older employees to quit.  It saved IBM millions by getting rid of older, more expensive employees without going through any kind of layoffs and payments.  There was nothing in this plan about telecommuting not working.  And the irony is that everyone is now working from home anyway.

For years now, when employees have been asked what they desire most, flexibility rises to the top. 100% working from home is dangerous to the individual and is a cultural killer for the company.

Nothing exposes incompetent managers/project leaders better than when the team works remotely or ""from home"". While there are some functions that cannot be done remotely (training cheerleaders comes to mind) most would benefit from higher productivity and lower operating costs."
2020-06-30 2:40,"Absurd! Employees don't feel any more connected to their employer than their employer feels connected to them - not much in most cases, unfortunately. And if you don't trust someone, why are you employing them? As for productivity, it's light years better at home. In a meeting at work, for example, where you don't want to be ignorant by opening reading your emails - or worse, you're not allowed to have your laptop open - I can work on other stuff while others drone on - and they don't see it."
2020-06-30 3:59,"There is a very fascinating story unfolding right now around remote work - this piece is not that story.
As someone who has worked remote for 15 years I can tell you that what we are experience today will absolutely transform the workplace.  Remote  employees who felt marginalized were indeed marginalized when they were the few people on the bridge, dialing in from 'outside' and trying to provide value to a team of otherwise face-to-face colleagues.  Throwing everyone in the pool leveled the playing field and gave us a glimpse at the promise of  remote work. Not flying 3 hours for a 2 hour meeting, seeing your colleagues with dogs and kiddos and life existing around them - it humanized us to one another and allowed empathy to seep into our relationships.  This IS the future of work, and it is working.  The writer should have seen the uniqueness of the current situation, and not regurgitated dated pre-Covid misconceptions abut remote work."
2020-06-30 4:36,"So what about younger workers? I’m seeing a lot of commentary from mid-career types, but what about those that are needing to establish their careers and develop their networks?

And then there’s the day to day of what’s lost to people in this position. What about office romance? Friendships developed over regular rituals? Drinks after work? There’s more to this than merely completing tasks and commuting."
2020-06-30 5:35,"If you (1) are a responsible worker, (2) have the tools to work remotely, and (3) are privileged to have a job that does not require in-person connections, then you will be productive wherever you are."
2020-06-30 6:24,"Let me put it this way - I am way more productive at home than at the office. Solution - mimic my day at home as closely to what I do at the office, so that I am as productive as if I was at the office - not more. Why? Simple - I have no interest in killing myself by being more productive. I want to pause and smell the roses, and my days at home have become really long as I always want to finish whatever it is that I am working on. At the office, if after 7-8 hours, the work is not finished, it's put off to the next day, and the next, and so on . . ."
2020-06-30 7:24,"This position in this article is poorly supported.  Of course business will fail if they expect the same outcomes just moving people from office to home without making any other changes.  Businesses must:
- Invest the money required to allow people a good at-home setup.
- Ensure the leadership instills a ""remote-first"" policy so everyone is on a level playing field.
- Provide the tools to collaborate as effectively remotely or asynchronously as you do in the office (swap white-boards for digital collaboration tools, swap the break room for digital happy hours or a company store etc). 
- Give people options on how they work best (remotely or at the office) but again, the company setup must allow both of these types of workers to be successful."
2020-06-30 7:35,"I was a bit apprehensive of working from home full time when this pandemic began. But after several months, a rearranged bedroom turned office, and a few ergonomic changes, I learned to love it. 

I'm eating better, work out more consistently, and I get to take breaks by stepping outside with my dog (who coincidentally is the best office mate I've ever had). I have no issues going back to the office at some point, but I hope it's only one day a week or less."
2020-06-30 8:46,"This is certainly the work question du jour but the real question is whether we stay tethered to the past or move on into a different (and challenging) future. To make it work well for all, will be an evolutionary process that will take still newer software and management changes to be fully implemented successfully. I see many friends in tech being productive and happy with the situation we are currently in. When management realizes it's working fine, it will continue."
2020-06-30 10:15,"Fortunately, I was able to work from home for about 60-70% of my career. I would never go into an office again.  It was bad 30 years ago and now it is deadly."
2020-06-30 10:31,"I'm surprised the writer didn't look at organizations like CDC where almost all workers telework a day or two a week. Fine-tuned infrastructure make it work pretty seamlessly, and then when the pandemic hit the switch to 100% telework was very smooth. Of course one of the major reasons CDC has the telework policy firmly in place is to respond agilely in case a pandemic or other disaster hits."
2020-06-30 10:44,"It all depends on what you do. My wife was working from home four days a week before Covid, now it's five. She has definite tasks that can be done remotely; it's as simple as that.

I have my own business as a writer and editor. Except for the occasional one-on-one meeting with a client who wants a book ghostwritten, all my work is done at home.

I suppose there may be reasons why some people need to be in an office, but if your work is self-contained I don't see why it should be necessary to get dressed, do the commute, and show up for face time."
2020-06-30 11:54,"Speaking from experience in the ROWE (Results only Work environment) which was instituted at the Gap many years ago, I can attest to the long hours and lack of cutoff that resulted from the absolute flexibility. However, I was committed to my work and felt a sense of trust that I’ve never felt in any other company. The ability to get into work late for a doctors appointment without having to ask my manager for permission was liberating. My work was still completed during my own time even if that meant working late hours into the night.

That said, in the ROWE, some employees still continued to report to work at the same times and followed their same schedules. This created a sense of unease with those that preferred to work from home, a feeling that you weren’t as committed or out of the loop to in-person conversations in the office. In a Covid world, where presumably everyone is working outside the office, perhaps that feeling disappears.

This article is too company centered and it’s lacks the perspective of the employees  who prefer quieter spaces to work as well as the point to view of parents, who are now bearing the brunt of work and childcare alone. The cost of housing in major cities like San Francisco and New York are suffocating workers and if given the opportunity to move to more rural or suburban locations in exchange for a lower cost of living and higher quality of life, companies would not only attract talented workers but also dedicated parents alike."
2020-06-30 12:04,"I work as a director for our company and I do not like working exclusively at home. I miss my team, the casual interactions and the efficiency of being able to quickly bring people together to solve small issues. There are jobs that transition very well to remote offices, but there is a lot lost as well. We already had a flexible work at home policy where most employees that could sometimes worked at home or had specific days that they did. It was working well. This current state is not. We have set up our offices so that they are safe, we require masks at work for everyone and social distancing and have asked people who can, to work in the office at least a day or two a week now, and the change has really helped. I certainly don't see us dropping our offices."
2020-06-30 12:28,"The usual false binary choice corporate thinking - backed up only by secondary anecdotes (these handful of companies did thus and so). 

The objective choice is to allow performance based flexibility. Did the work get done? Goals met?   If not, why not?  How to fix it?  

I especially laughed at the example of Friday telecommuting trial becoming a “3-day weekend.”  What did they think would happen with such a crude introduction.  

If one weighs the cost savings of reduced office rental and operations, even adding the cost of a sophisticated but flexible space share online reservation system, mandating periodic face to face department meetings and conferences, a true assessment can be done. Just don’t let the HR dept. design and assess it!"

2020-06-30 12:04,"Dinosaur managers tend to push/write articles like this when their careers are suddenly threatened. To them I say:

“Adapt or die.”

How many times recently in my IT career have I heard this or something similar from the lips of a manager. “Self-train. Take night classes. Keep your skill set up-to-date.“  The expectation that your employer takes an interest in your training died long ago along with quaint theories of business “social responsibility”. 

It’s not wrong, per se. But this time the shoe is on the other foot and managers with a tight-fisted, controlling style are struggling to update their skill sets. Sorry, managers but it’s time to use your own advice for a change. It turns out that technical knowledge and skill is not the only kind that can quickly become outdated and stale. 

If you still want to make a living managing people all day, you will learn how to effectively manage a remote workforce, or you will find another way to make a living. 

“Adapt or die.”"
2020-06-30 13:02,"After working at a marketing firm that is 100% virtual for 10+ years, I’d have a hard time going to an office again. The only drawback is on-boarding new employees — especially those who are just beginning their careers. We found it very difficult to train people remotely. That said, most of us had 20+ years of experience and we found being in an office generally wasteful and counter-productive. With today’s technology, staying connected isn’t an issue. Anyone “goofing off during work hours” would pay a high price by losing clients — and since every person on our staff is essentially an “experienced senior” employee, none of us wanted to risk not being accessible and accountable. The only drawback I can see is the home office is so convenient, we generally work much longer than “the old days.” I see it as an opportunity to grow by focusing on my work-life balance discipline. As people have gotten more comfortable with the at-home technology available, I am hopeful that one positive benefit of this Pandemic is a new paradigm for “office.”"
2020-06-30 13:29,"I have worked at IBM, Oracle, and Google so I can discuss this from a few perspectives. I worked at IBM when they made the move to bring people back into the office. First, IBM never forced all their employees to work in an office. There were select groups, like marketing, who were told to come back to an office. Much of IBM still works remotely. Second, this was clearly a move to create attrition and not because of the magic of cubicles. IBM was struggling and they wanted people to leave. If you tell someone who lives in Montana that they need to report to an office in Boston, more often than not they are just going to leave the company rather than uproot their lives.

If you look into these situations where people who have brought people back into the office, they were either situations where the company was doing poorly and they used forced office location to generate voluntary attrition or it was just the unscientific preference of some manager."
2020-06-30 13:35,"Working remotely eliminates opportunities for informal mentoring, teaching, and collaborating.  As a vice president, I maintained an open door policy, encouraging everyone on my team to ask questions and share perspectives with me or other colleagues whenever I, or they, weren't otherwise engaged.  Combined with this, I continued to believe in management by walking around, which invariably yielded more questions and substantive conversations, especially with people who ""didn't want to bother"" me.  Initially these approaches would be time consuming, but they saved time in the long run.  People are more productive when they understand not only their jobs but how they fit into to larger organization, when good ideas are shared, when rumors can be addressed promptly, when mentoring is ongoing, when everyone feels respected.  That it worked for the institutions as well as the employees was evinced by the record-setting financial results of my teams."
2020-06-30 14:03,"Smaller companies and small work groups are much more efficient than large, bureaucratic corporations. How many large companies are actually efficient? How many managers in these companies are worth their salaries and how many of them got there due to successful office politics? Don't blame telecommuting on management's failures."
2020-06-30 14:04,"Different business model, different technology and different generation of employees and managers.   All global companies have managed remote projects where employees are not in the same place successfully even before the Internet. 

As someone noted here, the hard workers continue to work and the less motivated do not.  The difference is management is finally noticing."
2020-06-30 14:04,"One element of the current situation that seems to be missing in any piece on remote work is that people are not “working remotely” right now, they are working at home during a crisis. 

Treating a few months during a once-in-a-century event as a time for a “case study” in how people work or how productive they are makes no sense. Many are working harder and longer because unemployment has skyrocketed and they’re fearful of losing their jobs. Others are crippled by stress and anxiety that is a burden on their performance or their creativity. 

There are way too many factors at play to gleam any real insight from the current moment as it relates to working remotely."
2020-06-30 14:07,"I'm a retired teacher. I miss two things about my working life: The students in the classroom, and my colleagues in the teachers' lounge (lunchroom).

Many decades ago, I spent a year working in a petro-chemical plant. The work was low-skilled, and after learning the tricks of the trade, hardly engaged my interest. However, the people on my shift became a social circle. They were friendly, respected each other, shared their joys and griefs. They were also adults who freely gave useful advice to a callow youth. That's what I remember about that time.

The people were at least as important as the work. That's true for every other job I've ever had. 

That's why working from home has no long-term future."
2020-06-30 14:08,"In addition to its other advantages, working remotely has completely neutralized office bullies. Either they must put their abusive rants in writing via email or DM or risk doing it in a Zoom meeting where they can be recorded or just keep it to themselves. And if they do feel the need to spew vitriol over the Internet, at least there’s a record and you can just press delete and move on with your day."
2020-06-30 14:43,"The difference this time is we, as employees, all understand that teleworking and the elimination of commuting time has only increased productivity and increased individulal satisfaction.   I see no value at all going to a specific office space to complete my work. 

 If companies pull back significantly, employees will push back."

2020-06-30 15:09,"Working remotely requires much more than just making an announcement and perhaps distributing some hardware. I've been working remotely, full or part time, for more than four decades.

The IBM approach of the late 1990s (I was there from 1995-1997) exemplifies what not to do. From simple things like insurance to more complex aspects such as group dynamics and communication, IBM did what seemed most convenient to IBM decision makers at each moment.  That approach never works.

Remote work requires a dedicated workspace that often requires physical separation. It needs doors that close. It needs space for monitor(s), a printer, a copier, and similar equipment. It needs high-speed hard-wired internet access. For many or most roles, it needs two-way video and audio access. All this is frequently difficult or impossible to do in a family home.

The premise that successful remote work requires workers who can be ""trusted"" betrays adversarial management attitudes that are toxic to any organization whether workers are remote or on-site. Organizations that genuinely value and respect their workers are very effective at discovering effective approaches to remote work. Modern technology makes those approaches FAR more robust and affordable.

Remote teams distributed across the world and comprised of contributors who are committed to the vision and goals of the team are, in my experience, FAR more productive than their brick-and-mortar counterparts."
2020-06-30 15:26,"Telecommuting right now relies on relationships forged in-person in the workplace over the years -- it would be very different to work remotely with people who you didn't know IRL.  I think a more realistic model is to move to a part-time in office, part-time telecommuting model."
2020-06-30 15:28,Feels like an outdated article. Comparing experiences from the 80s and 90s to 21st century business is baseless. Everything changed since then including technology and accountability. Its about accomplishments and results not how much time you spend sitting at your desk. The only reason I would see an office exist in the future is to enable creativity and innovation through live brainstorming and working sessions. Even that could be done in offsite meetings or using shared offices such as WeWork. The time you gain in commuting is invaluable and the access you get to talent wherever they sit is a change maker. Why settle for good people near you when you can hire great people and offering them the benefit of working remote. I'm not even talking here about the benefit for the environment. It's appalling for a progressive media company such as NYT to publish articles that use baseless and outdated data more fit to the NY Post.
2020-06-30 15:45,"As a fifteen-year veteran and fan of remote work, I was curious to read a ""long, unhappy history"", but it seemed more like the griping of a few managers that may have been, shall we say, not doing very well anyway. Also, the perspective of the workers was conspicuously absent. And Mr. Sullivan's claim that ""People have been going to work for a thousand years, but it’s going to stop"" was curious, since the modern work setting was rare before a couple of centuries ago. Indeed, for most of history, most people worked without a ""manager"" - imagine that!"
2020-06-30 10:14,"I’ve read in some European newspapers that China have discovered on new flu virus very harmful.  It is again China!!! The terrible ways the Chinese use to take care of food, animals and how “clean” are their markets, places of sacrifice and so on are making the country the most appropriate place to sprout pandemics, in my opinion.  That is why for many a years China has been the origin of many epidemics that have been falling over the rest of the world.  So, I agree with those opinions that push for a change in everything about Chinese food, bringing upon it some other ways starting with hygiene, clean methods an honesty."
2020-06-30 11:01,"Thank you for doing this story on Chinatown. It is a special place full of hardworking people.  It has been heartbreaking to think of the small businesses that have a mainstay for decades having to close. 
How can we help the small businesses that  keep their prices low and aren't on delivery apps or on the internet?  

It is awful that the government assistance during the pandemic was not made available in other languages. It is these small businesses that need the most help.  Boeing, Shake Shack, and other publicly listed companies have legal and financial advisors that help them access funding and they have substantial reserves.
Are there nonprofits that you recommend we donate to, those that help these small Chinatown businesses. 
Are there groups that are helping these businesses apply for PPP?
How can we help Chinatown and its businesses survive.  
It would be awful to have developers come in and replace these mainstays with hotels or trendy spots for tourists."

If thousands of people can mobilize and get on their feet, bicycles, and the subway to assemble at a location to protest police brutality, then we can similarly mobilize to help a restaurant gem like this stay in business. 

And all we have to do is talk on the phone and have a few greenbacks in our wallets. How is this not a no-brainer?"
2020-06-30 12:06,"The identity of Manhattan's Chinatown is under serious threat -not only by the effects of the virus - but also by the unfettered greed of landlords and real estate developers who saw it as a prime location to raze its buildings and erect monstrosities instead. I use the past tense because it's unknown at this stage if there'll be a continuing appetite for large scale buildings future in New York City.

However, Chinatown, its residents and businesses are resilient...and an increased number of its restaurants are embracing technology and using cashless systems.

Good luck Chinatown!"
2020-06-30 12:23,"If ever there were an ethnic cohort I’d not worry too much about, it is the Chinese. To wit: The Chinese in lower Manhattan flooded throughout Little Italy the vestiges of which are hardly two street blocks today. In reality there are THREE Chinatowns in NYC - Lower Manhattan from Manhattan Bridge to Canal Street, Sunset Park and Flushing. Accepting credit cards may be uncool to them, but many, many Chinese use WeChat payment apps to pay for things in China and here in US. There are Chinatowns in most every city of decent size in Europe and the Americas and Australia. Even most suburbs in many US states have a Chinese residential enclave with all sorts of old school food alternatives and other typical commercialization."
2020-06-30 12:27,"I love Chinatown and have been shopping, eating, strolling there regularly for decades.  Simple family joints are my favorite places to eat.  I want them to survive the scourge of CV-19 and to prosper in the face of relentless pressure for change/modernization.  To survive, Chinatown businesses have no choice but to keep up with the times and make their products more accessible to new generations of customers who demand delivery options, cashless payment, and other conveniences.  Sure many (including me) are nostalgic for the old ways.  But the issue is not about preserving Chinese culture.  It’s about an older generation, as the NYT piece reported, trying to maintain ‘culture frozen in time.’  Neither Chinese nor any other living culture is static.  There is constant evolution.  In China, Hong Kong, Taiwan and Singapore the old-fashioned NYT Chinatown style of business has already largely disappeared.  Even street vendors are going cashless.  Back in NYC the reality is that younger consumers won’t pay to maintain Chinatown as a historic museum.  To remain relevant to a changing society, Chinatown must evolve, too."
2020-06-30 12:40,"There is a missed irony here.

Leaving aside iconic Chinatown eateries of all types -- throughout Manhattan there are fewer and fewer ""Chinese-style"" food restaurants -- whether dine-in or take-out.

My nabe (Kips Bay) used to have a plethora of ""Chinese"" restaurants (i.e. eateries serving a form of what NY'ers consider Chinese cuisine).  But over the past decade or so, many have closed down -- often replaced instead with either Thai or sushi joints.

My unscientific analysis is that generally people have just gotten tired of ""Chinese food"" regardless of whether its Cantonese, Szechuan or Hunan etc. style.  So, other than a brief fling when lots of ""Chinese"" noodle shops opened about twenty years ago -- there's been a long decline in what was formerly the ubiquitous number of ""Chinese Restaurants"" 

My guess is that many of the now probably fourth or fifth generation American's of Chinese descent who own these places have recognized that now people want something more ""exotic"" than Kung Pao Chicken.

So in Kips Bay now there are plenty of Thai and Sushi places - which often employ recent Chinese immigrants.  

It's a wise business move for the owners.  People, generally, seem willing to pay more for ""Thai"" cuisine than ""Chinese"" even though the ingredients are nearly identical.

And sushi, of course, commands a much higher mark-up (even the local joints) than does General Tso's Chicken.

I still occasionally crave some ""Chinese food"" -- but now there are so many more choices."
2020-06-30 13:06,"Hop Kee is a New York City treasure. It has always been perfect as-is. It serves it’s cuisine two ways: one for tourists and bullet-proof take-out lovers and one for those long-time devotees (and Chinese locals) who know about the secret menu where more authentic seasoning and cooking styles are adopted. 
They cater to everyone: students and late night revelers climbing down the steep steps for the best shrimp and pork egg roll in town; Anthony Bourdain with his film crew, cracking into the crab entree with spicy bean sauce. 

I’ve been enjoying their cuisine and old-school vibe for over twenty years - including two Christmas dinners.

I live in the much, much larger Chinatown in Houston and I can definitely say that our businesses were affected much earlier than the rest of the city.  However, to say it was because of xenophobia is ridiculously disingenuous.  Many of our residents were obviously on holiday last December/January in China, a place that was being portrayed in the media as being in a deadly viral lockdown.  Who can blame people for not wanting to take any chances getting such a virus in an area of town that could have a higher probability of exposure?  As it was, our residents took earlier precautions than the rest of Houston by wearing masks and gloves before anyone else.  This helped us immensely in keeping it contained.  Of course, the virus spread anyway and the rest of Houston and Texas went into lockdown.  Since most of the businesses here are ma/pa in nature, we'll be losing a bunch when all is said and done.  I just hope it remains independent afterward and not turned into some Landry's corporate idea of a Chinatown.  The very thought of that makes me ill."

2020-06-30 13:27,I’m not sure the narrative of anti-Chinese racism entirely explains the decline in business back in January and February. Most of these restaurants serve a predominantly Chinese-American clientele that might have been more attuned to what was happening in Wuhan. It seems more likely that they were taking precautions and avoiding crowds long before the rest of us caught onto social distancing. It’s been a great economic challenge for businesses serving this community but it’s probably not a coincidence that Asians in NYC have among the lowest rates of infection.
2020-06-30 13:38,"Thanks for writing this. My family and I have shopped in Chinatown for decades. Chinatown was the lifeblood for my parents in the 1970s.  

I myself had my pedestrian checkups at 125 Walker.  Today, as a millennial  I visit Chinatown twice a week to buy take out and fresh fruits and veggies. Trader Joes and Whole Foods are nice, but I rather converse and have a friendly chat with my local vendors. They are hard working people trying to make a living in rain, snow, and heat. Kudos to them! 

My husband converses with street vendors in Vietnamese and I chat with them in Cantonese and English. You'd be surprised the fruit vendors can speak four languages: Cantonese, Mandarin, English, Vietnamese, Chew Chow.  One vendor told me her children are graduate students at Columbia University.

Pre-covid, I took the subway one stop and get off at Canal Street. Now my husband and I bike over the bridge. We will always love and support Chinatown. My husband was raised in the West Coast, and he's grown to love Chinatown after dating me and living in NYC for 10 years.  I just finished eating my peaches;  I might go to Chinatown today to buy some.

And honestly, on a side note, I find residents or NYC locals  in Chinatown to wear masks properly and socially distance. On the other hand where I live in Northern Brooklyn, people do not socially distance and wear a mask improperly. I feel safer  in Chinatown than in my own neighborhood."

My heart aches as I read this. As an immigrants, the Chinese presence in America is deeply inspirational to me; I aspire to their work ethic and priorities.  

Just because they don't celebrate their suffering in public forums does not mean anyone made it here easily and without facing intolerance and bigotry.  Yes, the Chinese diaspora in America - like many others - is inspirational and heroic.

But this statement!  Oh lord, I just had a flashback of my grandfather returning from WWII (Burma), and declaring that all women children on the farm will not go to school because he wanted them to raise good children.  I wish I could go back in time and talk to him, make him change his mind, and explain that the war he had seen was not because of poor mothering.  I wish I could talk to Mr. Lee and explain times have changed, and as he has done all his life, he must adapt in order to survive.  

Feel the love and respect Mr. Lee."

I'm not interested in helping restaurant owners dodge paying NYS taxes. I am interested in not transacting in paper money or coin during a pandemic; I'm interested in using digital apps rather than traveling downtown on crowded mass transit unnecessarily.

2020-06-30 14:10,"Thank you for the excellent update on the changes and trends in Chinatown!  I applaud the business acumen of the younger generation to modernize the operations of their family businesses to compete and survive. At the same time, I mourn the loss of traditional cuisine to accommodate novelty seekers.  In particular, it is impossible to find shops that make the Toisanese pastries that my grandmother used to make during the 1960s.  Those comfort foods connect me back through multiple generations to my cultural heritage with roots in the Toisan rice farming villages in China, which themselves are disappearing due to modernization. The skill to make the pastries is a lost art.  I wish the folks in Chinatown all the best success as they figure out how to balance tradition with modernization!"

2020-06-30 14:53,"This is just another symptom presenting of the generational rift that began after 1990s. The people that have been in Chinatowns and Chinese restaurants in middle America prior were mostly Cantonese, possibly paper sons or people with family already in America and ran low-tech restaurants that served cheap Cantonese food. They are all aging out having raised kids who have likely moved on to other walks of life. I remember being a kid walking around Seattle and I would only hear Toisanwah or Cantonese in restaurants. 
Chinese people who come over now are all well heeled, want the food of their home regions, and in higher end establishments more reflective of their socioeconomic status. You can't get around exclusively on Cantonese anymore. While this transformation was occurring prior to the pandemic, the pandemic certainly highlights the generational and socioeconomic gap that exists between the then and now of Chinatowns and Chinese restaurants all across America."

The restaurants, bakeries that double as dimsum joints in the morning, and grocery stores with all the wonderful produce you can’t find in other neighborhoods are open again after mostly being shuttered for months. Walking down there to shop and pickup food to take home is now my favorite part of the week. It’s not quite the same without all the hustle and bustle and dining rooms filled with happy patrons, but at least I can enjoy the food again! The first time I brought home Pho Haoi a few weeks ago (a Brooklyn institution along with its sister restaurant on 4th ave and 86th st in Bay Ridge), the first bite of pork spring roll wrapped in herbs and lettuce and plunged into Nuoc Cham made me cry.

 There is no reason that the restaurants could not accept credit cards over the phone--do the authors think the owners are that incapable? It would, however, make tax evasion and paying workers off the books much harder by revealing more of their actual income.

Yes, apps gouge restaurants, but delivery and curbside pickup should not be major issues--the city is filled with low wage bicyclists delivering Chinese food and people walking to pickup takeout.

Nor was ""xenophobia"" the sole cause of the loss of foot traffic--foot traffic there by Asians plummeted as well.  And was it only bigotry that caused many to worry that Chinese who arrived in the city before the Chinese government blocked travel and made greater disclosure of the pandemic would have visited Chinatown, especially after return fights to China were blocked?

A much bigger issue was that people were afraid to go anywhere, including Chinatown, by mass transit, taxi, Uber, etc."

Here in America, we ought to be more frightened than is generally apparent. The South and Southwest, for example, are now experiencing infections from the plague and deaths from it that their governors, in deference to the president, ignored until just as recently as last week.

There were right-wing howls of protest. American citizens thought that they were being bullied and being told what to do and being finger-pointed to about how to live their lives. The virus was picking off and killing certain demographics in the population that hardly applied to them: ""those others.""

New York took the first real hit. Hospitals were overwhelmed. Intensive care unit beds quickly filled. When the infections gave way to fatalities, the dead were piled into freezers outside the hospitals. Rural America chafed at restrictions that they denied applied to them, good, hard-working people.
Self-righteous in their indignation. 

For the young and the immune and the beautiful and the chic, the pleasures of life beckoned. On the beaches where the sun shone upon sleek, svelte bodies, splashing happily in the waters, the virus wasn't a problem. That's changed now.

It was ""American exceptionalism"" that would lead the way--until it wasn't. Other countries grasped the immensity of the problem and sought to curb the virus while studying it, always running behind it.

The president also makes the claims that increased testing is skewing the numbers in attempt to deflect any blame from him.

The scientists, medical professionals, people with advanced degrees in the field of epidemic and pandemics, degrees that Trump and Pence have not been awarded, warned our leaders, and the people, a resurgence would occur.  Yet, we ignored the warnings and admonishment to continue to wear a mask regardless what the “Freedom to Breath Agency” promotes.

States where they took the initial burnt of the virus, finally were able to take appropriate actions and drove their numbers down are starting to see an upward swing in numbers.

Some of it is that each state has areas that were not excessively hit back in March and April.  In Pennsylvania's case the center and western parts of the state were not hit very hard.  Now those areas are seeing the upward swing. We are also seeing the change of where most older (not all) people and those at risk continue to take precautions but the younger people are pretty much over the quarantine and not willing to take the actions they need to take.

Reminds me of the movie ""War Games"" when they thought they had everything controlled then the computer decided it was going to launch the missiles on its own.  Is there any action, any effort, that will stop us from heading down the path we all feared in March which is a 30-50% infection rate and millions die?"

We DO NOT have the right to infect our fellow citizens (or anyone, really) by flouting the dictates of medical professionals and refusing to use common sense. For the past four months, we have been bombarded with Covid facts and figures, with infection and death statistics, and with the simple preventive measures of wearing face masks in public, keeping a safe distance from others, and washing our hands. But so many of us take these measures as an infringement on our “rights,” that we have become a danger to each other. Without proper  (or any) leadership from a president who accepts no responsibility and actually flouts prevention himself, what can we expect? The states whose governors worship at the feet of the president have the highest number of cases, and soon will see their death toll rise precipitously.

I'm sure that since we have about six months to go, and since the country hit hardest by the virus, the U.S., has not done much to reduce the spread, we'll get over a million casualties this year.  But globally, this isn't a number that will do much to humanity.

Not trying to downplay the seriousness of the virus really, just wanted to point out, this is nothing at all like the 'Spanish' Flu epidemic, we are getting off fairly mildly here.  I've seen a lot of end-of-the-world nonsense over this, and really, it's not that bad at all.

2020-06-29 14:41,"Moving forward this Oandemic experience should open our eyes to what the Chinese Communist Party really is.  It seems this virus jumped to humans because of negligent regulation of wet markets or virology labs.  After that it was actively coveraged up based on the governments treatment of whistleblowers and apparently coordination with the WHO.  Remember the Jan 14 WHO tweet.  
""World Health Organization (WHO)
@WHO Jan 14 Preliminary investigations conducted by the Chinese authorities have found no clear evidence of human-to-human transmission of the novel #coronavirus (2019-nCoV) identified in #Wuhan, #China""

We should extent what we have learned about the CCP to other isdue like Hong Kong, and Taiwan, the South China Sea, intellectual property, and product safety.  We need to remember that if the right to govern comes from the conscent of the governed, and without elections, the CCP has no ones conscent.  

How dare they threaten Hong Kong and Taiwan.  Both have done far better economically on a per capita basis and without the severe pollution.  Growth of narrowing the economic gap by reducing economic interference is not going a great thing.  it is simply getting out of the way.

And among the Europeans, the UK (can it still be considered part of ‘Europe’? ) stands out as having a high per-capita death rate, having refused to shut down as long as possible, and also led by another Trump-like populist (until he became severely ill).

We can’t trust the numbers out of Russia either, which claimed to have the virus under control. As closely as China is now tracking the virus, some of its numbers were definitely on the low-end, particularly when it was overwhelmed with people dying on the streets; and perhaps later, as it tried to convince the world all was well.

The false propaganda, conspiracy theories which have been with us for many years, some going back decades, and human beings’ willingness, or more accurately, desire to believe them in order to avoid inconvenient truths is at the source of much that is wrong now.  It won’t be easy to undo the damage (judging by what I
still hear from some in the media, even as others fall sick or die around them), but perhaps this virus will be the start."
2020-06-29 14:50,"I think people need a silver lining to this bad news, so I'd like to point this out.  The disastrously incompetent response of the Trump administration to this pandemic is likely going to be a major factor in his losing the election.  If he does lose, and I pray he does, the world as a whole will have dodged a bullet, that bullet being the extinction of humanity.

Everyone's forgotten all about this, but in December Trump tried to initiate nuclear war.  He assassinated a major Iranian leader, nearly triggering an all-out war with Iran, and that would have brought in Iran's biggest all, Russia.  Direct war between the U.S. and Russia would go nuclear, and as those are the two largest stockpiles of nuclear arms, that war would eliminate humanity, and most species on the planet.

That's what keeping Trump around is going to produce eventually, he has no self-control, no concept of consequences, and that's not even the only time he tried to cause nuclear war.

So, if the virus helps him lose, the death toll would have been completely worth it.  Losing 50 million Americans would be preferable to letting Trump get re-elected, because next term he surely would try again to get nuclear war started, and if he succeeds, that would be the end of humanity."

1.	required masks, 
2.	enforced and/or socially expected quarantine and isolation, 
3.	promoted social distancing,
4.	greatly reduced commerce,
5.	had extensive contact tracing, and
6.	had extensive testing.

3.	promoted social distancing, and 
4.	greatly reduced commerce for a short while, 
5.	are improving contact tracing (without extensive testing), and 
6.	have no extensive testing (not promoted nor convenient).
We have tried the same cures, but not as intensively, and we jumped back into the race even when we knew that the injury was well healed.

Other countries have shown that much better control of COVID is possible, and many of them are now re-opening their economies in environments where the public can have much greater confidence in engaging in commerce without notable risk of infection.

We can get there, too, but only after going through a period of more intensive control measures. The US has been on economic superstar for decades. Then all the countries got injured by COVID.

It's too bad the US still, 7 months in, isn't taking at least a few pages out of the playbooks of the many other countries that were on top of the virus from day one and that have successfully and dramatically controlled the spread of the virus and resulting deaths, as compared to the US.

More than 25% say they will refuse a vaccine and that coupled with a vaccine being maybe only 60-70% effective will make wide-spread immunity in this country unlikely.  Furthermore, contact tracing, he says is not going well because Americans are refusing to cooperate with contact tracers when they call.  Very sobering.

2020-06-29 17:21,"I assume that Trump will eventually give in, and then we’ll see him wearing a mask too.

At that point, he’ll say, “I’ve been telling Americans all along to wear their masks! The masks are beautiful and only very very very brave people wear them proudly. Especially the ones with the beautiful flag. Don’t forget to drink your Clorox, which is tremendously effective. There are beautiful people on both sides.”

Did I cover everything?!"
2020-06-29 17:31,Let's see how vocal Pence will be when he returns to Washington.
2020-06-29 16:54,"The graph of confirmed COVID-19 cases per million residents in the U.S.A., Europe, Canada, and Japan, presented in David Leanhardt’s article, shows that there is a significant flaw in the U.S.A.’s response to COVID-19. Confirmed COVID-19 cases in U.S.A. plateau and then grow, while confirmed COVID-19 cases in Europe, Canada, and Japan decline. Downplaying the seriousness of COVID-19, and mocking science based public heath advice is not working. Too much of the American economy remains closed, too many Americans are contracting and spreading COVID-19, as a result, too many elderly Americans are needlessly dying."
2020-06-29 16:59,"Will trump ask pence to resign?

Or is pence preparing to assume the office when trump quits?

Either way, it is starting to look like their 4 years of infamy are coming to an end."

2020-06-29 17:21,"Mike Pence wore a mask some of the time, listened to a 100-person choir that wore masks - then took them off to sing, attended and event where most people didn't wear masks:
ZERO credibility."
2020-06-29 16:33,"43% of U.S. Coronavirus Deaths Are Linked to Nursing Homes

--- The Times two days ago.

If I am understanding President Trump and VP Pence correctly, the huge number of nursing home deaths -- although regrettable
-- will greatly reduce the current strains on our Security Security system, an improvement that American voters should credit them for."
2020-06-29 17:21,"I'm not a lawyer, but at what point do the actions of this administration cross the line into criminal negligence? Not that laws apply to Republicans anymore."
2020-06-29 17:26,"Mr. Pence and the other stellar members of the Trump Administration have failed to protect Americans from SARS-CoV-2, much on the same level of protecting our Democracy from Kremlin Russian G.R.U. intelligence officers."
2020-06-29 17:35,"This has been excruciating. Two to three weeks ago, multiple governors (Republicans) following the administrations cues, decided the worse was over and ""opened up"" their businesses. Now, three to four weeks later, we are worse off than months ago, and have no contingency plan but to let this rum rampart while intermittently playing whack-a-mole if things get too ugly. The complete lack of federal input shows the entire concept of small government to be a farce. Vote Democrat, even if you are a ""freedom-loving"" Republican. Competence and responsibility should still matter."
2020-06-29 16:30,"Is there any data that supports temperature checks as a PRIMARY deterrent to infection spread?  My impression is that the vast majority of community spread is now through asymptomics or presymptomics.  If data shows this is an ineffective practice, then it should be advised against because its use gives a FALSE sense of safety.  

A Gov't interested in prevention would produce the data.  Health departments should go to high traffic areas, take temps and samples for a large number of individuals.  What does the data show?  Of course, our Fed gov't doesn't WANT to know.  ""If we stop testing, then it will go away...."" Head in sand.

Trump Undermines R Democracy and Safety 
(every day finding new ways to soil our country and endanger its people)"
2020-06-29 16:54,"Too little, too late. The fact that Trump put a flat-earther like Pence in charge of a federal coronavirus response team, is all you need to know about how seriously (not) our so-called leadership took the pandemic and the science behind it."
2020-06-29 16:57,"The new remake of “Dumb and Dumber” has been a success across portions of the south. Starring Grey Abbott, Dan Patrick, Ron DeSantis, and a whole host of loyalist from the Trump thespian players. The plot: with lots of available scientific medical data, a group of misguided politicians work feverishly to restore personal economics of top earners while secretly manipulating their constituents to buck the data and recklessly return to work putting their lives in jeopardy. Here are some of the more memorable lines, “there are more important things than living”, and a magical delivery by the incomparable Trey Hollingsworth regarding deaths due to coronavirus, “the lesser of two evils”. 
A cameo role by Dr. Oz put it all into perspective when referring to school openings he said that it’s an , “appetizing opportunity to get the countries mojo back and that it cost only about 2 percent to 3 percent lives”. 
And how about Grey Abbott’s typical offbeat delivery, “If I could have done anything differently, it would have been to delay the opening of bars.” Oh, he forgot to mention that social distancing, wearing masks, self-quarantining and common sense are all optional. The movie has been swapped in theaters with a new version that has been quietly re-released. That is why lots of incredibly unbelievable character dialogue have been left out of my piece due to the new rewrites; always subject to change without notice. In production, the 2008 movie about voter suppression, “Recount”."
2020-06-29 17:30,"Ignorance and stubbornness is finally yielding to reason, but not soon enough. Pence's change in policy is political opportunism, nothing more. In the meantime, Pence, AZ Gov Ducey, TX Gov Abbott and FL Gov Desantis caused irreparable harm to the economy and countless deaths.

They need to answer for their crimes. Had the United States promoted the spread of a toxin in another country, they'd be accused of war crimes.

Americans are important. Punishment is imperative so future (so called) representatives remember who they work for."
2020-06-29 17:36,"Since I've always detested most of Pence's ""conservative"" views and have had little or no respect for the man himself,  I don't know why I am surprised and disappointed that he is wearing a mask. The bipartisan support for the flu hysteria, which I believe is far more harmful than the flu itself, will cause countless voters to stay away from polls in November."
2020-06-29 17:33,"Jacksonville is now going to require masks in public places where social distancing is not possible. Will the Republicans in charge of their convention go along with that since Pence has seemingly gotten on board, or will parts of the convention get moved again?"
2020-06-29 16:37,"So much for the theory that the virus will disappear in summer.

The hottest time of the year is here but the virus is jumping.

No wonder it is called the ""novel"" virus.

Nobody knows anything about how it will behave.

The only things that work are face masks and social distancing. And those have been made optional.

We may have to livr with this virus for at least a while."
2020-06-29 17:32,"More than 2.6 million infected, 128,000 deaths by far more than any other country in the world. Deeply in debt and deeply divided. Mile long food lines everywhere. Our country used to be admired and envied now they pity us. That is Trump's America."

2020-06-29 16:00,"We New Yorkers can only wish for a ""surge"" like Texas'.  Mostly young people who are less likely to be harshly affected. Its total deaths are a fraction of ours and would have to increase 100 times to reach ours.

I shudder to think what our numbers will look like after 2 massive rallies.  Yes, outdoors, but that doesn't make people someone immune.

The states of NJ, NY, CT, MA and RI now lead the nation in deaths, with numbers far in excess of most states.  It's a mistake to single out red states TX and FL, when they've done a far better job with fewer restrictions."
2020-06-29 14:55,You sold us all Flatten The Curve. Now we are expected to be all in on Stopping All Transmission until a Vaccine is Found. Those are two completely different packages and the one I was sold is not the one you are offering today. Bait and Switch on Steroids doesn't even begin to describe it. The Curve has been flattened. People will Still get this virus and some of them will die from it. That's called Life.

In contrast, New York is not opening its malls yet and won't unless special air filters are installed first.  Do people actually do social distance in a shopping mall?  Can a mask rule be enforced in a shopping mall?  Answer to both is that yes, but it is very spotty.  With a contagious disease, spotty is not good enough.  A mall is a huge enclosed space in which hundreds 
(or more) of people converge all breathing the same air.  Expect another surge of infection in the next 2 weeks in NJ."
2020-06-29 18:24,"Why are people getting covid tests on their own?  All public health people I have heard from say they have essentially no value to individuals, although of course they are needed by local public health authorities to track things. Covid tests seem like a bad idea for most people, since in Texas one may have to wait a long time in a car or a crowded line, you get charged a lot, They only are good for a day or so if you are out and about and it may take a week to get results. Finally, they create a permanent record (probably searchable by insurance companies) of a serious illness that may qualify as a pre-existing condition for almost any later disorder."
2020-06-29 18:28,"New York State, and particularly NYC, may have had the fortunate misfortune to be the first victim of COVID. Why? Calling Washington for support in a Federal crisis, Andrew Cuomo got the 'you're on your own' memo early enough to literally take the management of the disease out of the hands of the inept administration and carve a path for NY based on the best science, public health, data and policy expertise he could find - and from anywhere in the world.  

It's too soon to know if NY will survive the pandemic and no governor can do everything right, but I  sense that state governors either decided early on to save their states on their own, or bought into the political righteousness of Washington's not-so-benign neglect and are now facing the consequences."

2020-06-29 17:08,"Given the number of deaths of Americans already, Pence well deserves to wear the label ``too little too late for many''.  He and the president regularly use mafia speak (for deniability) as they communicate resistance to the only known defenses (distance, mask, test, trace) against this lethal virus to their base.  For them the one and only thing on their minds is re-election. Pence is scratching and scraping in his ongoing auditions with 45 to remain on the ballot, fearful that he will be replaced by Nikki Haley (if she is dumb enough to take it)."
2020-06-29 18:24,"Every thing is so catastrophic, it will remain so....... until Mr Biden can save us.
We are all doomed...
The end is near"
2020-06-29 18:06,"Yeah, once red states start blowing up with the virus Pence suddenly has an interest in wearing masks. Shame, shame, shame on both him and Trump for their despicable lack of empathy that wearing a mask connotes. They are appalling leaders."
2020-06-29 17:26,"These guys waffle and can’t make up their minds. 

Weak stupid leadership < if you call them leaders at all."

2020-06-29 17:35,"Aw gee, thanks Mike!  I never would have thought of wearing a mask had you not said so."
2020-06-29 16:57,Maybe the Vice President had a brief moment of sense and realized how profoundly and dangerously stupid he sounded when asked by John Dickerson about mask wearing yesterday.
2020-06-29 17:01,"Uh-oh, trouble in River City! Can Trump fire Pence??"
2020-06-29 16:33,"Pence a dollar short and a day late.  Now that the republicans are responsible for over 100,000 excess American deaths they belatedly start to wear masks.  

Meanwhile, the intelligent Chinese close down an entire county because of 30 new cases, do 7 million tests in less than 2 days and have a functioning economy.

Why can't the US be more like China?  Because we are led by a group of science denying, ignorant old white men who respect dollars over the lives of Americans."
2020-06-29 16:33,"A very wise friend of mine says, ""If you're gonna be dumb, you gotta be tough"". That's the mindset of 40% of Americans - dumb and tough."

2020-06-29 17:55,Also a sharp contrast to the only-recently mask wearing pence.  He just got on board with the mask.  In another month he’ll start to pretend he also knew the virus was spreading and not just due to testing.  How is it we have two of the most ignoramus people in the highest positions of power in America.  Will this nightmare ever end?
2020-06-29 17:43,"Pence is encouraging people to wear a mask! Wow, did not think I would see this day. Mike Pence did not wear a mask back when he went to visit Mayo clinic in April. Will he apologize for his past actions and acknowledge he was wrong?"
2020-06-29 17:42,"While the Trump Administration did not release the covid genie on the U.S., it did nothing to stuff it back in the bottle.  We can blame a malevolent President for our plight.  His greatest claim to taking action was to stop air travel from China and Europe.  Apparently travel restrictions to virus control are like tariffs to the economy.  What comes around, goes around: to wit EU restrictions on U.S. Travelers.

He told us he was a war time president who would beat the virus.  He quit in a snit when it became clear he was a charlatan whose only tools were bluster, lies and snake oil cures.   Trump put Hope and Pray Pence in charge of the task force to pull a bait and switch on the American people.  Just last Friday I learned under the President's great leadership a disaster has been averted, and we have made great progress since April.  I know the folks 30 plus states a relieved to hear that. 

I also learned on Friday that one has a first amendment right not to wear a mask.  The VP must have had a divine inspiration over the weekend.   A little voice whispered ""wear a mask Mike, or thou shall be smitten like the 125,000 that went before you.  And then, it could have been a little ""motherly"" advice."
2020-06-29 18:01,I’m very happy to hear this from Pence. His next move should be to get the Cabinet together and 25th Trump.
2020-06-29 18:03,People who are in nursing homes are very sick to begin with.
2020-06-29 18:35,Please compare this to Europe and Asia. Have their deaths also been linked to nursing homes?
2020-06-29 18:46,"43 percent of Covid 19 deaths are in nursing homes and over 94 percent of hospitalizations are elderly or folks with T1 diabetes and/or severe heart disease.  So, why did we need a comprehensive lockdown that scientifically and, therefore, mathematically treated EVERYONE as equally likely to be hospitalized and equally likely to die?

Some will say the benefit of the total lockdown approach is to minimize transmission.  Well, since the most vulnerable segment of the population is so clearly delineated, the alternative is to isolate the most vulnerable and support them with Covid 19 free and Covid 19 antibody folks.  In this manner we could have dramatically reduced the human suffering collateral damage of the lockdown (over seven million new malnourished kids many of which will now have lifelong learning impairments (Brookings Institute study), skyrocketing domestic violence (UN), etc.).

Hopefully, we will think beyond the onde-size-fits-all approach for the next Covid 19 wave that Dr Fauci has predicted."
2020-06-29 17:54,"I said it before, and will say it again.  Those who elected T will wail and mourn the day they cast their votes over disaster predicted.  This was nearly four years ago, and now the chickens have come home to roost"
2020-06-29 18:05,"Thankfully the USA--Canada border was closed in mid-March. It must remain closed until a vaccine is developed.  I live in Sarnia Ont. at the border to Michigan.  Ont's  death % per million people from Covid-19 is 1/4 that of Michigan's & the rest of USA's. Only Ont. nurses & transport truck drivers hauling products & food are allowed to cross the border. Every day many dozens of Ont. nurses go to work in the hospitals in the bordering states of Michigan & New York, a fact little known to most Americans.  I have numerous friends who are retired & winter in southern USA & none intend to return there next winter.   They're disgusted with those selfish American's who refuse to wear face masks to protect others, especially seniors who are more likely to get the serious form of C-19."
2020-06-29 17:39,Maybe Trump and his followers can understand this: Masks sheltering - we win. No masks and not-sheltering - the virus wins. Keep it simple.
2020-06-29 18:26,"What I find truly shocking about the coverage of Pence’s talk of wearing masks is the massive hypocrisy of Trump’s refusal to do so and Pence’s refusal to insist that others—like the singers—wear them. What is even worse, however, is the softening of media coverage. On Good Morning America this morning, Secretary Azar was not pressed on the mask issue by the formerly reliable George Stephanopoulos, and one of the main GMA people commented on the valuable information Azar had provided. 

Azar didn’t provide information, he provided a party line. 

Even the Times has apparently gone soft.  We cannot become inured to the lies and appalling conduct of this administration."
2020-06-29 18:44,43 Percent linked to Nursing Homes. That's so far. After the virus rips through that population then what happens?
2020-06-29 17:45,"That's one thing Trump hasn't lied about: he said in his inaugural address that there would be ""vast carnage."" Vast and deadly, beyond anyone's imaginations.

But when Trump later said ""I alone can fix it,"" it's clear he meant ""I alone can cause it."""
2020-06-29 18:33,"Remember that the main reason for wearing masks is to keep you from spreading the virus to others, if you have it--especially if you sneeze or cough. It's not really about protecting you--it's about others.

That's why Trump won't wear a mask. Trump is selfish, and the president of the selfish. By refusing to wear a mask, he telegraphs: Be selfish, like me. It's more important to show that you're selfish, than to save someone else's life."
2020-06-29 17:52,"At this moment Mitch McConnell is pushing for laws to protect the OWNERS of nursing/long-term care homes, to shield them from liability and accountability, i.e., to protect their MONEY."
2020-06-29 18:41,"It's important to note that in the form of government we have here in the US, there is no way to remove wrongdoers from office, save impeachment (we know how that turned out), even if they have caused the deaths of tens of thousands of people through reckless behavior and reckless policies.

By the time the general election comes around in November, how many thousands more will have died?"
2020-06-29 17:40,"If there has been any final proof of Trump's total consumption with his absolute need to be all-knowing, and how he is so flawed in his ability to reason, it has been his handling of this pandemic.  And it is particularly reprehensible that he has put millions of Americans at risk by his ""insistence"" that face masks are not only not necessary but also ""cowardly"" or ""unmanly"" protections.  Yet, it does not stop with Trump.  We need to look no further than his vice-president who is not unlike the proverbial lemming when it relates to heeding every word from his boss's mouth.  There should be no kudos to Mr. Pence who is now encouraging the use of masks in a Red state.  Why not in New York, sir, or New Jersey or any other Blue state that so needs and needed support to assuage the devastation wrought upon us by Covid-19?  This administration's egregiousness is unending."
2020-06-29 17:44,"trump refuses to wear a mask, presumably because it’s a sign of  weakness. The mask is not for his protection ... it’s for protecting people around him from him. His refusal is not a sign of weakness, but  a sign of brazen disregard for people around him. It's also a grim but apt metaphor for trump's reckless insipid self-serving attitude at large towards the pandemic crisis enveloping the nation and the world!"
2020-06-29 18:05,"The notion of Pence suddenly getting religion about masks is preposterous.
He’s nothing more than Trump’s sideshow stuntman.
Ersatz performance art is not leadership. 

Keep in mind this is the same actor who flew to a Colts-49ers game in Indianapolis solely for the purpose of walking out after nearly two dozen players from the visiting San Francisco 49ers knelt during the playing of the national anthem."
2020-06-29 18:04,"Not wearing a mask is comparable to open carry of a pistol, a statement of personal responsibility for safety and health, displayed frankly. 

This is important to those who favor individual responsibility over that of government regulation.

Risk of harming others by this behavior is diminished by placing the individual's welfare and comfort level above that of others.

Mr. Trump amply demonstrates his concern for himself above that of others, whether family, partners, citizens, banks, nations. It is characteristic of autocrats and energizes their bullying, intimidation, condemnation, scorn of others. 

Criticism of the behavior has no effect, autocrats are immune to disagreement, instead belligerently attack critics. In extreme cases they wreak physical harm and death.

Ethical and law-abiding persons should be cautious about driving Mr. Trump into a corner due to the possibility of his invoking presidential authority to wreak vengeance on opponents, his multiple daily verbal threats may be preamble to orders for non-verbal actions suffered in other nations.

Precursing that, Mr. Trump's belligerent behavior has inspired individuals to wreak harm more systematically in recent weeks by individual shooters and police officers.

Attorney General Barr, though top law enforcement officer in the US, shows no courage to oppose Mr. Trump's open carry of a gun to threaten the citizenry. 

Mr. Pence wearing a mask in defiance of Mr. Trump shames Mr. Barr."
2020-06-29 16:20,"Sorry to have to state the obvious: as COVID strikes republican-led regions, the Trump administration starts to discuss COVID in a (semi) serious manner."
2020-06-29 16:20,I’ve noticed since the weekend Pence is looking more and more like he’s taking the role of president.  Is Trump looking for his off-ramp? Is it possible??
2020-06-29 13:56,"Priorities matter. Protecting the American people is more important than stunts and tweets calculated to boost Trump's floundering reelection campaign. Controlling Covid is the key to reopen the economy. Trump didn't get it when the virus first threatened America in February, he still doesn't get it now in the face of surging outbreaks in southern and western states. Enough already, new president please."
2020-06-29 16:52,"Just watch. Pence is going to suddenly ""come out"" as Mr. Reasonable. Trump too, but in much shorter frenetic spurts. You're going to see a lot of Hail Mary passes between now and November. Maybe a ""national security"" crisis or two. Perhaps the rumblings of an imminent war on some foreign shore. Desperation all around. 

And to those criticizing Biden for not being more publicly engaged at this moment? He's doing exactly the right thing. Speaking when he needs to, and letting Trump continue to dig his own hole."
2020-06-29 19:18,"""43 percent of US virus deaths are tied to nursing facilities"" 

The concentration of COVD deaths in nursing homes may also, in some part, explain low virus deaths in countries like South Korea and Taiwan. There is much more of a commitment to the welfare of elderly people in those countries, both in terms of social norms and in terms of government policy. There have been plenty of horror stories from US nursing homes before this, but the pandemic has again shined the flashlight on yet another ugly aspect of American society."
2020-06-29 19:31,"During the period when a huge minority of deaths originated in nursing homes, younger adults were not out and about in force due to the lockdowns. Nonetheless, those age 20 to 50 comprised 38% of hospitalizations. About 4% of infected 20-somethings were hospitalized. And 10,000 deaths of the 126,000 to date were people in their 20s, 30s, and 40s. Now, as we see more and more younger adults becoming infected, we can expect to see more and more hospitalizations and deaths in those age brackets."
2020-06-29 19:50,"Pence, among the other Vichy Republicans, are beginning to position themselves for a post-Trump world. So long as the polls remain where they are expect more pathetic gestures from them. 

That said, don’t trust the polls! Be afraid and send what resources and/or labor you’re able to WI, MI, FL, PA, and maybe Georgia."
2020-06-29 19:20,"New York, directed by Cuomo, takes the lead:

""Mr. Cuomo is responsible for the single worst public-policy mistake of this pandemic: His administration’s order requiring nursing homes to accept Covid-19 patients from hospitals. That bad judgment let the virus rampage through institutions with the most vulnerable populations."" WSJ"
2020-06-29 19:28,Could that be why they’re called “nursing” homes?  They don’t necessarily sound like such a great idea.
2020-06-29 19:39,"""Vice President Mike Pence made a point of wearing a face mask in Texas over the weekend and encouraging the practice.""

Nothing like arriving to the party, unfashionably late.

Glad that he is finally wearing a mask, if only for show rather than because he truly believes it is the prudent action to take . . .  well after the fact now that Texas AND Florida have exploding number of new cases of this virus."
2020-06-29 19:48,You guys seem to be doing your absolute best to continue to scare the public. 1) Where is the story out of NY about fatalities decreasing 50 percent between March and April that is available from other news sources (not Fox); 2) Where is the context for the ICU capacities that virtually always run at 85/90 percent because that’s the hospital’s business model; 3) where is the context around the child syndrome and the stats of 0.03 percent fatalities among those age 5 to 17 (99.97 percent survival) so that you don’t needlessly scare parents who really ought to be considering intelligent strategies to get their kids back to school in the fall. This type of coverage is great for your paper. And bad for your readership. Report the news with context or don’t report it at all.
2020-06-29 18:50,My focus in on the statistic. The US is 4% of the world population but seem to have over 25 % of the deaths due to covid-19 or some 6 times more deaths per capita than the rest of the world. Is this what Trump meant by making America great again? We are surely number one in something.
2020-06-29 18:50,"President Trump, if you truly want the economy to rebound and help your political fortunes, marshal the power of your office to effect a more comprehensive and nationally led response so we can send our kids back to school safely this fall.  When people can go back to work and companies can hire again everything you desperately want to crow about will happen.

If you keep your head in the sand and keep punting the responsibility to Governors and Mayors and creating the inevitable patchwork of measures that comes from that approach we will continue on this path.

Set the agenda and the example.  Recommit to a public health campaign, complete with PSAs and education about the virus and how we mitigate it together.  De-politicize masks and come up with a robust system for distributing them if people cannot get the effective kind themselves.

2020-06-29 19:12,"""One of the central messages of the briefing — from Mr. Pence, Mr. Abbott and Dr. Deborah L. Birx, the coordinator of the White House coronavirus task force — was to encourage everyone in Texas and other states with a high number of new cases to wear masks to stop the disease from accelerating.

So in states that are not showing a high number of new cases, people don't need to wear masks until the number of cases increases and then they should wear masks? Is that ""saying it like it is""?? Sounds more like the pretzel logic that goes by the name of ""communication strategy"" for those people who are supposed to be providing clarity, consistency and direction for the population.

There is nothing particularly mysterious about the spread of this virus or similar agents. If people are ""confused"" about what they should be doing, it is because policy is skewed by politicians who believe they can harvest some political benefit by obscuring what is now well-understood -  before the biological truth catches up to them and to those still exceptionally large numbers of people who are susceptible."
2020-06-29 19:44,"Listening to Cuomo crow about his successes and how his state was 46/50 in nursing home deaths is pure genius. Just one simple remark that NY got it right and the other states like Texas opened too early and are paying the price now. NY got it right. They had 15x the number of deaths/capita that Texas had when NY was shut down and Texas wasn't. NY is not having an upswing now because so many people got covid there are precious few left to get it. Some zip codes in the Bronx had 50+% antibody positives. Texas is having positive covid tests at 1/5 the NY peak, and a very high concentration of positives among young people at low risk, with a vastly lower mortality rate, and they waited for some therapeutics to be available. Texas did have more nursing home deaths as a % of total deaths because they are having a much lower death rate. NY had a high death rate in nursing homes, over 3% but so many more deaths that were not in nursing homes that it made a lower portion of total deaths than Texas. To be able to make one simple statement that cuts across such a tremendous scope of hypocrisy and deceit is a truly amazing skill. Truly breathtaking."
2020-06-29 19:10,"That statistic for nursing home and long term care facility deaths is shocking. The government’s mismanagement of this pandemic is effectively a cull of the most vulnerable among us. The horrible truth about this is there are many in our society who believe this is okay. It’s God’s will, or it’s,Darwinism in action, or it’s just something that doesn’t affect them so they (per magical thinking) are safe. 

I see this attitude everywhere. Last week I read a short news article about a local, elderly man who died from Covid-19. The reporter pointed out that the man was not only very old, but had some chronic health issues. The implication was that he was going to die soon anyway, so this uptick in the local Covid-19 death tally doesn’t matter. Several (awful) people posted comments spinning this story into variations of, “This is proof that the pandemic crisis is fake, and we do lot need to wear masks, and the government never needed to do the lockdown in the first place, and destroyed people’s businesses for nothing.” People actually think this way. 

Shortly before the lockdown, I had a conversation with my hair stylist about the virus, mostly focusing on how it would affect her business. But she — who is just one of those (dreadful) people who is the sun at the center of her own universe — said something to the effect that it was good that the virus was only taking old people. Needless to say, I have not rushed back to see her now that the salon has reopened."
2020-06-29 20:18,"let us not forget the thousands of health care workers who contracted this virus under similar conditions: healthy people in close proximity to infected , contagious people. Hospital ER's are designed and used by both infectious and non-infectious patients. Come in with a broken leg , leave with the flu. This was the past and still is by the way. The designs of ER's , doctors offices  medical clinics , leaves otherwise healthy people sharing waiting rooms and exams rooms with infectious patients.  Time for a complete redesign to hospitals and doctor's offices.  That is the future, what about the present  , how do we fix this dangerous problem?  With money of course and given most hospitals and clinics are privately run, cost always comes in the way  to the remedy. Good old capitalism and the profit motive.  You gotta love it."
2020-06-29 18:56,"Speaking as an older person and being familiar with nursing homes in general because of a medical supply business I once managed, I do not believe coronavirus deaths in nursing homes should be included in the pandemic total. With some exceptions, most residents in a nursing home are very fragile and near death at all times and the least infection will kill them. Including them in the death total makes the coronavirus appear to be much more virulent than what it is."
2020-06-29 19:26,"Now that we have data showing that more than 40% of COVID deaths have been connected to nursing homes, I'm waiting for everyone who attacked me in March for suggesting the least of evils would be to quarantine the medically fragile while everyone else soldiered on using sanitizer, masks, etc. rather than economically devastating the whole world to apologize."
2020-06-29 20:12,"The percentage of NY COVID fatalities involving nursing home residents is dramatically higher (more than double) than the #s reported by Governor Cuomo and the NYS DOH. That is because nursing home residents who contract the virus in the nursing home but die in a hospital a few days or weeks later are not counted as nursing home deaths in NY. Other states count both as nursing home deaths which is why nursing home residents account for 65-75% of COVID deaths in Massachusetts, CT, RI and Pennsylvania. The NY state undercount likely means the majority of U.S. COVID fatalities have been nursing home residents. This is also the case in Western European countries.  This vulnerable population needs to be protected, and the reality should shape our public health and socio-economic strategy going forward."

2020-06-29 20:52,"Unfortunate 54,000 Coronavirus COVID-19 related deaths linked to nursing homes where seniors above 65 live is not a total surprise. What does that tell us? That nursing homes  are not places that one can expect to live in too much passed average life span? That as we age our immune system declines and we could become fodder to a virus with an appetite for human lungs? The central ventilation of the same air circulating all throughout each nursing home is not ideal for containing the virus spread? That in seniors after the virus is done damaging lungs, the immune system goes haywire and chronic inflammatory damage sets in? That younger asymptomatic care givers and visitors are the carriers that carry into nursing homes viral infections? 

More questions than answers but a clear answer is we need better designed nursing homes sort of like Gandhi's ashram where each room has its own fresh air supply. Those who are dying could be saved in the future with dexamethasone treatment administered in later stage during the course of progression after first treatment with antivirals in the early stages. Basically the disastrous experience and lessons learned should avoid the seniors from being sleeping ducks to be consumed by the nano sized monster menace.

That said life expectancy means we cannot expect everyone in nursing homes to live much longer than in their own homes.More and more we can provide home care for our seniors so that they are more content and contained from infections."

2020-06-29 21:10,"Is there anything else that can be done to reduce the COVID death toll in nursing homes?

Yes, all residents should be taking Vitamin D supplements.

Recent scientific evidence suggests that COVID-19 deaths may be linked to Vitamin D deficiency.

Note that people in nursing homes and prisons (hotbeds of COVID) are unable to go out in the sun, so supplements are necessary.  Supplements are also helpful for people with dark skins, for whom UV exposure is less effective for Vitamin D production.

Vitamin D tablets of 1000 or 2000 IU cost pennies a day and are universally available.  Everyone should be taking them!"
2020-06-29 21:00,"43% of deaths are attributed to nursing homes. Wow. 

Of all the things the TrumpWH could have taken action on, and mobilized on...it was the nursing home populations. Contained populations, where any number of local health services could have been brought to bear and perhaps reduced that number by half, or at least 15-25%. Which is a lot of saves. 

And what great Public Relations that would have been for that nest of vipers in the WH. ""Look we saved granny and gramps!"" ""We saved veterans!"" 

Which points to the most bumfuzzling part of the WH responses...or lack there of. They could have taken a targeted approach, zeroed in a vulnerable population or two, or three, and actually shown they were making an on the ground effort. Instead of the denials, the apathy, and the, ""its on you states, go git 'er done!"" approach. So no matter how much they actually had a hand in getting done, its erased by the belligerence of their public showings. Trumps public showing of what a ""tough guy leader"" he loves to play on TV.

No matter how many ventilators they delivered, or the Navy hospital ships they sent, or PPE they finally got in the hands of front line medical and emergency personnel...it was Trump, and even Pence's, rank belligerence to the facts, the realities of the dead and dying, the daily showing of being put-out by being asked to help - that overshadows any positive efforts.  

The Dems and Biden messages were written for them by those displays of sheer belligerence."

As a side issue, Ohio allows free Covid-19 testing for anyone who wants a test by using drive up pop-up tents with trained National Guard members to take the tests no insurance needed.

Another side issue - I don't think ""cases"" should be the key criteria because they will automatically increase as more people are tested.  For example: if 100 people are tested and 2 are found with Covid - that is a 2% rate.  If 1,000 people are tested and 20 are found with Covid - that is also a 2% rate.  If 1,000,000 are tested and 20,000 are found with Covid - that is also a 2% rate.  A better measure of the issue should be how many are hospitalized or how many die."
2020-06-29 22:26,"I am mostly opposed to DeVos and her madness, but I think there is a point to be made that many private, non-religious schools are at risk of failing.

And the ones at risk of failing are not the ones that are serving the children of the Top 10%.

Many people outside the Top 10% scrim and save and apply for scholarships for their kids to go to private schools. Why? Because their kids have needs that aren't being adequately addressed in public schools.

First, insurance companies and the public schools got the DSM-5 to write Asperger's out of the diagnostic code. Some (but not all) of the Aspies were included in the expanded definition of Autism Spectrum Disorder. The rest are simply denied services now.

Public schools struggle with how to handle kids with learning differences and other challenges. So much so that there are entire private schools filled with ""different"" or ""quirky"" kids from whom public school is a disaster.

When you consider how much public schools have SAVED by not serving these kids, whatever crumbs DeVos wants to throw at them are trivial by comparison.

If Trump is re-elected in November, we will know, without a doubt, that the United States no longer exists in a form that reflects either the purpose of the radical American Revolution or the adoption of its essential counterpoise, the Constitution.

Get out an vote in November if you want to save America."

If kids show up with no masks or are caught taking them off or fail to wash their hands properly, send them home with a suspension for a few days.

Shut down again for two weeks. Partially open and stay open for five weeks. This will take us through end of October, by when we should have at least a partially-effective vaccine to start deploying.

The number to watch is the mortality rate, which is a lagging indicator by a few weeks, and if possible, the hospitalization rate as an indicator of severe cases of the disease. How well are we protecting the vulnerable populations, such as elderly in nursing homes? That's where the action is.
Young people driving up the incidence rate by going to the beach or bars don't bother me, since they typically have a milder form of covid and survive. They know what risks they are taking for themselves. The greatest risk is their infecting vulnerable populations--that's been true since February.

If our nation ever hopes to hold an actual position of social equity among our citizenry, let alone that of leadership in the world, we as a people must understand how this thinly disguised fiction works.

Physical force rather than reason is the arbiter of differences among our citizenry and the underlying basis of law in our and most other societies which in turn has led to the acceptance of militarism by every male led nation in the world. This premise is threaded through every religious belief to which we are urged to turn and every religious belief was devised and is controlled by men.

Present cultures in nations led by women have shown that violence is unacceptable and most clearly unneeded.

Overwhelmingly peaceful protests here have been visited by the external source of violence ordered from men in positions of authority which should clearly indicate the basis of this thought.

And stairwells rarely have good ventilation either, so unless you only have a few floors to go, this is not a great option no matter what kind of shape you're in."
2020-06-27 18:33,"Words matter.  NYT, please educate, don’t sensationalize.  A petri dish is for growing bacteria.  An elevator is a potential setting for person-to-person exposure, not a petri dish any more than other enclosed spaces like shops, taxis or salons.  Explain how the same risk reduction measures apply in different indoor settings: avoiding prolonged shared occupancy, distancing, mask wearing, ventilation, hand hygiene, and surface cleaning.  There are nuances of difference, of course.  But like the oversimplified “density   public transit = disaster” narrative you pushed for weeks (rather than crowded housing, umasked passengers and transit workers, and a subway system turned into an unsafe homeless shelter) implying that elevators are some uniquely dangerous place is unhelpful.  In fact, the NYC as petri dish picture your journalists painted for weeks may be one reason for the complacency in less dense cities and sprawling suburbs that is now playing out with disastrous results."
2020-06-27 18:46,Because elevators are an enclosed small space with bad ventilation there isn't much you can do except not use tall buildings.
2020-06-27 18:53,"This is great, but should come with a few caveats for riders and the employers:  1) Don't hold the door open so more people can get in like you used to and 2), modify the union contracts so people are not unfairly gigged for having to wait in line to get upstairs.  With changes in transportation in general and the obvious wait for the elevator in high rises, the rule for people who have to ""punch a clock"" (thank you very little, time-keeping software slime,) should be, you work your assigned number of hours from when you are able to get there and punch out afterwards. As it stands now, many people who have to use time-devices are treated arbitrarily and capriciously for delays beyond their control (talkin' to You MTA, but I'm sure many other employers); in addition to hours-long round-trip commutes, just how early is one supposed to arrive to be ""on time"" and not getting paid until your ""start"" time? In the wake of the virus, an entire new paradigm is required for fair and reasonable work time keeping; especially when you see how efficient people were when they didn't have to report to an office/location."
2020-06-27 19:10,"I wish more buildings would iinstate strict dingle rider policies like these for elevators, or at least put up signs advising people to ride alone. I'm immunocompromised & disabled. My doctor is on the 4th floor of her small building & I need to see her in person but the building's elevator is tiny & last month 2 other women refused to let me ride alone even though they'd have been next. Now I feel I cannot risk going to my doctor for my treatment and my health will greatly suffer greatly if I can't. This is to say that these policies regarding things like masks, distancing, and yes even elevators, really do affect people - sometimes more than you know."

Another thing we've practiced since late February: TALK AWAY FROM ONE ANOTHER.  Yes, talk AWAY from the person you are speaking to or with. For safety.  Wish the NYT would write about that very simple but seemingly ignored truth and safety approach. Thanks!"
2020-06-27 19:31,"So an elevator that has its max of four people stops on a floor where one person has been waiting.   That person is in a rush and gets in anyway.   Now it’s a stand-off.  He’ll stand there until someone gets off just so he can have his way because that’s his plan.  Eventually one or two may feel so uncomfortable they will get off.

The guy wins.  I can tell you exactly who that guy is—it’s the same guy who rides a bike in the streets of NYC and runs red lights and stop signs.  Who doesn’t leash their dogs.  Who dangerously weaves in and out of traffic at 85 MPH on the FDR.  The same selfish guy who thinks the rules don’t apply to him and can do what ever he wants because his attitude is: I don’t care--Me First.

This time around, there’s no dog, car or bike.  Just people facing-off in an enclosed space.  Let’s see how that goes."
2020-06-27 19:39,"If there are openings at the top of the elevator cabs...perhaps install strong exhaust fans to pull the air upward and out of the elevator cabs and let the viruses be diluted in elevator shafts.
And perhaps there are exhaust fans which might include filters and UVC to purify the exhausted air as much as possible."
2020-06-27 20:24,"“If an elevator comes and two or three people are in it and you feel comfortable, you’ll get in, and if you don’t feel comfortable, wait for the next one.”

This totally disregards the issue of how uncomfortable the people already on the elevator might be having someone else cram on. 

It's a good microcosm of why our cases are exploding - the emphasis is on deciding what we personally are ""comfortable"" with, when in fact our focus should be on what is most likely to protect others."

2020-06-27 20:43,An article in San Jose Mercury News  a few weeks ago quoted a Berkely Virologist   as saying it takes roughly 15minutes of exposure to get the virus.

""Breathing Coaches, Who Normally Teach Singers How to Breathe Properly - and Now Teach People How to Hold Their Breath for a Ride in the Elevator""

Anna Dimenko has built her career on teaching singers and actors on the proper use of the diaphragm and proper breathing techniques

However, with the virtual shutdown of live performances, Mx Dimenko has been out of work for the past three months.

As the city prepares to re-open for business, many office workers are nervous about being stuck in a small, enclosed elevator with four or five other people for 45 to 80 seconds while riding up to their floors.

""Actually, it's really not all that difficult for a person to hold their breath for ninety seconds"", says Mx. Dimenko, who is now giving online courses in breath control to teach people how to hold their breath for up to a minute and a half

""It's almost like Yoga"", says Dimenko, except without the breathing.  You need too learn how to relax and slow down your metabolism to the point where your body requires much less oxygen than under normal circumstances""

Mx Dimenko points to the people who dive for oysters with no breathing apparatus and can stay submerged for up to six minutes

While there is no medical evidence connecting holding one's breath in an elevator to a reduction of infection risk, some medical professionals say it might provide another layer of protection, along with a face mask

Mx Dimenko's course costs $350 for four online lessons..."

Strikes me that these might be areas of delusion - such as airplanes and airports - real superspreaders that got this disease out of wuhan and delivered it to the world in short order.  Trains might not be much batter.  See the Times own articles on how the disease spread out of Wuhan and how it spread out of China.  And the airlines want us to sit less than 3 feet apart.   

Practices such as the current lack of distancing on airplanes (less than 24"" shoulder to shoulder) may be convenient for the airline companies deluding us into thinking it is safe to get back into the skies.   But I have yet to see the CDC say those distances are safe."

Yet another example of cultural attitudes that put the “me” before the collective. 

What about the comfort of the 2 or 3 people who are already in the elevator? 
Does Mr. Hardy suggest we ignore their comfort level or desires?
Do they get to vote on whether to allow the person onto the elevator?

Many buildings in NYC already have security procedures in place that can be adapted for this new situation:
You punch in the floor where you’re going (or a building attendant punches it for you, or you use an app), you get directed to a specific elevator, and it takes you directly to that floor without stopping. On the way down, the same procedure. 

Nobody should need to face the decision of whether to get on an already-occupied elevator or whether to allow someone new onto an already occupied elevator. 

An even better solution: If you can, take the stairs. Even on the way up. 
Most Americans don’t get nearly enough exercise anyway.

A highly infectious disease will infect all of us, sooner or later. There is no cure and no vaccine on the horizon. Mostly, what we have is endless virtue-signaling and gratuitous scolding over wearing masks. etc.  There is NO magic bullet, including masks. that are going to prevent Covid from spreading throughout the world's population. Social distancing, masks, two to an elevator, etc. won't make any difference. The moment we cease these precautions, the disease surges back. 

Here is an incontrovertible fact: all of us must die. The elderly and sick are at greatest immediate risk and we should prioritize their welfare. Middle-aged and healthy older people will have significantly lower morbidity rates and the young will hardly be touched. There can be no other way -- unless we are to live like the much mocked ""survivalists,"" holed-up for years with no income or educational and social lives. 

It's going to happen -- we can slow the rate at which it happens but, in the end, why is that important? We all did the ""flatten the curve"" business and we're right back where we started. The disease will win.

From the micro (elevators) to the macro (climate change) we seem incapable of dropping the old production models. Why? Perhaps because we cannot contemplate the medium term disruption to incomes, profits and wealth, it is simply too disruptive.

Thus we avoid the required scope and scale of changes. And we leave individuals to find their own comfort levels with participation in the existing production models.

The MTA talks about limiting the number of passengers in subway cars, but has not explained how they will do this, nor is there any indication that MTA workers are monitoring crowding -- including panhandlers and other miscreants -- in subway cars. I used the subway this week and the only MTA intervention I saw was workers stationed at high-use subway entrances giving out face masks to people entering the system.

For the last few months we have a rule of only one person/family per elevator, and restricted outside vendors and contractors to limit the volume in the service elevators. The other day we had a storm and a power surge and the elevator I was in dropped a half a floor.  I got off on the eighth floor once the power normalized and took the stairs up  29 flights to my apartment. This inspired me to suggest that people combine social distancing and cardio exercise by taking the stairs for some of their journeys up and down.  In a thirty story building, if people on the first five floors took the stairs and others got off a few floors short of their floor and hiked the rest , the elevators would be less crowded and the residents/tenants would be in better physical shape.

These employees — goaded for fear of being tardy — seemed ready to risk infection. I quickly got off that elevator. Not a minute later another elevator arrived and I took my usual rise to my work floor — alone!

1.  ""Mr. Linde said Boston Properties retained consulting services from Joseph Allen, a Harvard University assistant professor, who specializes in indoor environmental quality, and experts in managing elevator traffic. They helped work out a math problem: What should the limit on elevator capacity be so as not to create a traffic jam in the lobby for those waiting to ride?""

2.  ""The consultants figured four could be a reliable limit even in the tallest buildings, so long as total building occupancy remained below 60 percent. Otherwise, people will have to wait too long.""

""Otherwise, people will have to wait too long.""  That's the only real concern because otherwise the landlords will risk losing their customers - the companies that rent space in their buildings."

Due to the rapid rise in local cases and several building residents who are actively participating in risky social activities, I am about to switch to the stairs despite the stress on my knees.

Elevators are everywhere. I went to a doctor's office over in the local hospital's professional building the other day. One issue with elevators is people who seem oblivious to distancing, so get in and simply stand where they would have before (obviously, not wearing a mask or wearing it on the chin or below the nose is also an issue). Many of us cannot completely avoid elevators. We will have to protect ourselves."
2020-06-28 10:34,"The elevator problem is just one more nail in the coffin of onsite office work. The logistics and economics of the traditional commute to an often faraway location make this work model jaw-droppingly cost-iinefficient.

2020-06-26 13:57,This doesn't make sense to me. No one in gym-attending group was found to be infected. That means that there was no virus being put into the air at the gyms. So how do we know if the social distancing practiced at the gyms prevented people from getting sick? There was no sickness to avoid.
2020-06-26 13:58,"Great article. We need to get back to normal with some safeguards. We cannot stay locked down forever. As a Cycling Instructor and athlete, staying healthy and exercising is important for both mind and body. Way to go Gina!"
2020-06-26 13:59,"From Switzerland: our local gym (Zürich region, one of the most affected by Covid-19) opened up at the end of May, after months of lockdown. The measures implemented are simple but effective: disinfect your hands with sanitizer when you enter the gym; then every time you use equipment, you disinfect it thoroughly using disinfectant wipes provided freely by the gym. All aerobic equipment is spaced out at least by 2 meters. Nobody wears masks, they are not required. The changing rooms and showers are shut down, you must arrive already dressed for your training session. Indoor-only training shoes must be worn at all time. 

It has been now one month, and there have been exactly zero cases of infection. Everyone follows the rules scrupulously, and people keep their distance. 

If only America hadn't politicized the virus and if all people worked together to follow safety guidelines and take common sense precautions, this entire thing would be over fairly soon."
2020-06-26 14:05,"The results of this study are close to meaningless. As Dr. Bretthauer notes, the amount of virus circulating in general in an important variable. The fact there was no statistically significant difference between the two groups does not show that going to the gym is safe, and certainly cannot be extrapolated to suggest that reopening in general is safe. The results more likely support the fact that the actions taken in Norway over the period prior to the study were effective in reducing the amount of transmission of the virus."
2020-06-26 14:07,"The biggest issue I have going back to the gym is that it's not just the underpaid hourly workers' cleaning practices I don't trust (anyone who has worked in food service in this country knows that for every person careful with hygiene there are three who aren't paid enough to care), but the other patrons.  In Norway I'm assuming people aren't protesting in the streets because they are told to (gasp) wash their hands or (good gracious!) wear a mask.  Few gym goers in this county even bother wiping their sweat off their equipment after they're done with it.

Combine that with the fact that Norway is a country with few cases and falling, we are a country with the most cases and rising.   I miss the gym more than anything else that has closed during social distancing, and I hate my new spare tire, but it's not worth the risk.  We are not a responsible country at any level."

2020-06-26 14:36,"While the headline offers hope, the perception of Norwegian people by many is one of thinking of the greater group over self interest.  The gyms limited the space between those who exercised.  The non use of saunas and showers by members was a positive as the airborne droplets were denied a route to spread infection.    As one who has been a gym goer for many years, the article is silent about the scourge of almost every gym.  The gyms seem to attract a very small percentage of participants that are constantly attempting to heft barbells and dumbbells beyond their ability to control the weights.  The result is a thunderous sound when the equipment is dropped.  The noise is irksome but the individuals usually emit a very deep exhalation from the depths of their lungs.  If infected, a very efficient method of spreading disease is a superhighway of sorts.  Those who persist in such irresponsible conduct ignore gym operators who attempt to curtail such practices.  By doing so, the transgressors are engaging in a form of bullying others who are trying to achieve a healthy state.  Buzzer sounds as one chain implements are not a solution.  Hopefully, someone will find a remedy."

What about it taking more than two weeks for symptoms to show up?  Or for them to get serious enough to go to the hospital?  It was a good idea but needed to be tracked much longer.
2020-06-26 14:23,"Noooo.  Even in the worst of the outbreak all of Norway had roughly 300 cases a day while we had (and have) thousands upon thousands. It borders on irresponsible to suggest, as this article does, opening gyms may be warranted.  Sure, when the prevalence of the virus here mimics that of Norway.  Maybe in a couple of years…"

Cases in SW Ohio where I live are surging, despite Gov. DeWine’s efforts. This surge happened within two weeks of reopening restaurants, bars and yes, gyms.  Even with temperature checks, spaced machines and the nod to increased cleanings, there’s no way our gyms aren’t super-spreading hot spots."
2020-06-26 14:07,"This study is absurd.  If no one in the gym was shedding virus, no one in the gym will get infected - not even if they take off their masks and kiss!"
2020-06-26 15:02,"This study proves nothing.

""The results? The researchers found only one coronavirus case, in a person who had not used the gym before he was tested; it was traced to his workplace.""

Read it again. None of the people who used the gym were infected. It takes an infected person to spread it, and that did not happen; they could have been meeting in a crowded room with no masks, and they still would not have been infected.  

""This shows us that low-prevalence environments are safe for gyms and probably just about everything else.""

Most things are safer in a low-prevalence environment, absent a superspreader event. But for all practical purposes, this was a zero-prevalence environment.

No dice... I'm working out at home until this thing is over."
2020-06-26 15:18,"Like others have pointed out, this study basically confirmed that low incidence Covid-19 environments are safer, no matter the activity.

While the study did fairly compare non-going gym enthusiasts to the ones going, I'd submit that regular gym users are more likely actively monitoring their health than the population at large. They are an ideal population of health-conscious people, who while not necessarily more careful about their impact on others, are likely to be more mindful about their personal health from fitness, to diet, to sleep, to stress, etc. I wouldn't extrapolate the results to our diverse, dense urban area gyms."
2020-06-26 15:20,"It's not about nationality. It's about mentality and maturity. Many residents who used the gym in our building never wipe down pre-COVID. It's the ""Me so privileged"" attitude - ""I can afford to live here and so I don't have to do any cleaning. I don't want to wear a mask and nobody can make me."" I don't see why they will change their ways because of the pandemic. That mentality, like the pandemic, will never go away.

I am fortunate that where I live, I was able to buy a squat rack, some weights and a rowing machine.  Now, I lift heavily at home, jog and row.  I've never been happier, and I very happily avoid the Petri dish that is the American gym system.  Gym goers are inconsiderate about anyone else, and the people who work there generally could care less (or aren't paid enough to care) about hygiene."
2020-06-26 15:50,"Not going to the gym and staying fit has potential health risks too. I live in an area where summer temps are typically triple digits. Walking outside isn’t feasible.  So far, the incidence of coronavirus here is 1 in 2000+. Going to a distanced gym is not as big a risk to me as becoming sedentary. If I lived in a hot spot I would likely feel differently. 

As for whether the machines are clean a) it’s not the primary route for transmission, aerosols are and b) wipe down before and after."

When it comes to restaurants, though, perhaps I need to stick to dining outdoors."
2020-06-26 18:24,"Let me understand they did a random test and only one person tested positive and traced to a source NOT the gym.

But the larger paired sample was equally clean and similar?

Thus conclusion is when the COVID infection is low to non-existent you can't get that.  Did I need a article for that.

In Florida and Texas I assure you where it is widespread, it'll be spreading in the gym.    

My city opened gym, I go, I'm probably 10% that wear mask.  Most kids don't practice social distancing, wipe down, not a surprise COVID is rampant among them as they go out."

If there would have been just ONE infected person in one of the gyms, we would know if, and how much, the virus would have spread there. But since not a single person in this group of gym-goers was carrying the virus, an infection was impossible.

Churches can now open at reduced capacity but gyms can't even in phase 4. Thinking about stationary people sitting 6-8 feet away from you for the length of a church service versus people circulating through a free weight room and machines, I'd take the gym over a church. But not an area with stationary bikes and treadmills, where the rate of breathing is higher and the same people are next to each other for 30-60 minutes. Concerts, churches and gyms are obviously all risky and opening them is only consistent with very low levels of community prevalence. The problem with actually testing any of this empirically is that to figure out exactly where it becomes dangerous, you have to risk lots of people's lives."

It would be easy to, for example, cut the amount of lanes in half in order to expand the lakefront with more beach, parks and paths, while introducing toll on Lakeshore Drive.

Good point, Austin, and reason why a good education is so vital in our democracy.  The concentrations of CO2 will not go down because these figures reflect cumulative emissions.  Even if we emitted out what would be a staggering 30% less CO2 in 2020 than in 2019, the cumulative CO2 concentrations would still rise.  If we were graphing emissions for each individual year, there would be a big dip.  Overall, it is obvious that we should rejoice in this context, because the CO2 concentrations in 2020 will be considerably less than they otherwise would have been.

The crisis for most citizens thus far during the pandemic, even more than the deaths, has been the economic realities of businesses shutting down, and people becoming unemployed.

Like a cozy chair we like to sit in, a spot in the yard we like to visit, or a place we feel comfortable in, we are drawn to what we know, and makes us feel rewarded.

The pandemic has given us a gift:  we can all see, with our own eyes, what reducing the pollution from the economic engine so many of us work so hard to keep running does for our planet; it makes it cleaner.  It is nearly a miracle that in such a short time, that the ways we have degraded the planet show signs of healing so quickly.

Much of the population can't wrap their heads around climate change.  We know that too many heads of state (many can't be called leaders), have been willing to let citizens die so that they could maintain economic success.

If we don't take advantage of the mindsets that are developing, and push, now, to create a just society that lives as though the biology of our planet is critically important to each of our lives, we will miss an historic opportunity to change the trajectory  of climate change.

We have seen our leaders dismiss an obvious danger to us; they ignored it.  They will have no more courage, or vision, to meet climate change head on."

Vermont itself does not generate much air pollution, but it is a recipient of a lot of bad stuff from the Ohio River Valley and other points west.  So, maybe, just maybe, my eyes are not deceiving me.  Now, if we could only achieve these goals without a pandemic shutting down so many of the sources of our pollution."

Due to Covid-19, I was extra cautious about my immunity and health and at the same time I was getting more and more anxiety issues due to the lockdown.  The best part is this is the first time when I didn't had any respiratory issue in two consecutive months as compared to the pre-Covid19 times when I used have such issues weekly. 
The climate change researchers had a great opportunity  to learn the impact of industries and motor vehicles on the air quality and what air quality can be achieved when these are shut or stopped. In other words, the current air quality levels can be treated as a benchmark which the future clean air technology can aim to achieve. The recent guesstimates regarding the highest contributors of air pollution in different region will be quite instrumental in creating or inventing better policies and technology to reduce the pollution.
Humans should consider this phase as a reminder to preserve nature."

The resulting downturn of Airbnb has also meant more housing for the locals at better rates, and full-time renters take better care of their apt and neighbhood.

Even my neighborhood, which used to see a tiny share of tourists, is so agreable now that I feel reluctant to return to pre-virus, even though I also like seeing people, and businesses obviously need foot traffic, just as shopkeepers in major destinations need tourists as well.  Surely a compromise can be found; Italy was already enforcing rules for proper behavior (if at times draconian, but it’s their cities), Bhutan has been limiting visitors for years.

But fewer tourists would not only improve the quality of life for the locals, it would also improve their own experience. As a traveller myself, I realize how fortunate I was to have seen those sites decades ago; I am willing to forgo future destinations I haven’t seen yet if it means a better environment. And fewer international tourists mean less pollution, whether by road or air. It could also mean less junk plastic souvenirs, focusing instead on local arts and crafts - more meaningful consumption."

What's most interesting is the loss of air pollution appears to, at least for a while, increase ozone loss due to ""weird air chemistry"" as the scientists noted. It also increases average daily temperatures swings due to loss of the shading effect to the sun's rays and at night eliminates the ""blanket effect"". Thus wider temperature ranges.

Many countries which followed these policies never had to shut down completely, nor would we have had to had there been someone with a brain, a conscience, and a soul running the country instead of a greedy, grubby reality TV failure pretending to be POTUS.

When climate change hits for real, it will be much, much more devastating. Carbon dioxide molecules remain in the atmosphere for 200 years, methane (25-40 times more effective at keeping the heat in than CO2) last for 10 in the atmosphere because they are much lighter.

2020-06-26 3:41,"Typically the human centered attitudes here talk all about saving peoples lives, but I did not hear anything about saving the other lives on the planet. There is a whole lot of value in saving , say, bees, or flowers for bees, or trees,or even the earths microbes. Some of these are far more important to life on earth than humans are."
2020-06-26 11:50,Talk about not letting a good crisis go to waste. A significant reduction in carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere from reduced levels of man made emissions over a relatively short period of time resulting in increased health benefits. The most optimistic report yet of how resolvable global warming can be with more pronounced governmental interventions. Alas representatives beholden to outdated industries will find their own group of sycophantic experts to dispute the finding and prohibit new regulations and government funding to encourage clean energy usage.
2020-06-26 12:19,"You don’t have to be a scientist to experience the effects of the Covid shutdown on the environment. All you have to do is look up. I haven’t seen a crystal clear blue sky like this since I was a child and I am 64 years old. The other day while walking my dog I came upon a small hill where I could see the horizon and bright white puffy clouds. The distance I could see was astonishing, probably 10 miles or more and something I have not seen before on my walks here over the last 20 years. We sit on our patio and enjoy the quiet instead of the din of traffic and airplanes that fly over every 5 minutes heading for Ohare airport. I realize this comes at a cost and that it won’t last but maybe it should give us pause and make us question the impact of our go anywhere anytime lifestyle. What do we really need to do and where do we really need to go just because we can? I personally am relishing every second of the blue sky and beautiful weather that has accompanied Covid. It’s proof that maybe nature can rebound in ways we never knew if we just gave her a chance. Millions of people all over the globe have experienced the result of what we have had to do by necessity so maybe that will make change easier to do in the future by choice."

2020-06-26 14:53,"Despite the current conditions being a hopeful sign for our health and environment, you KNOW this cleansing moment won't last. 
Just like there has been a surge in Covid-19 infections after  some states lifted social safety mandates, the atmosphere will pretty quickly resume its unhealthy state after a majority of people in the world return to the old normal some day."
2020-06-26 4:08,"How can people be persuaded that climate change/global warming is, in the long run, more dangerous than COVID?

The proliferation of pandemics is itself a corollary of toxic expansion and exploitation of our finite planet. The web of life is being manipulated out of existence, as we do the equivalent of paving over paradise.

We can no longer treat the earth as a combined cornucopia and dumpster without consequences.

Waste should no longer be taken for granted as a human right. Sharing and sustainability are no longer something people can dismiss without consequences, though I know they will.

Time to wake up!"
2020-06-25 22:34,"I am misfortunate enough to have witnessed the effects of acid rain in the 1970’s Adirondack Mountains. Through careful limiting of sulfur dioxides the toxic showers improved and nature recovered. 

Today, the covid-related decrease in polluting activities demonstrates again that nature still has restorative power. Will Republicans use this as a moment of learning before it’s too late, or er, ahhh sorry. I shouldn’t have used learning and Republican in the same sentence."
2020-06-26 12:51,"The images of New Delhi are not revealing: April ALWAYS bring clearer skies in Delhi, because October/November is the height of the ""stubble burning"" in surrounding states: the burning of agricultural waste in the fields in Punjab and other states. That is mainly responsible for the choking air October through December, and it is seasonal.  No burning takes place in April; the skies would be clearer regardless of Covid-19. The comparison should be between April and February, which also does not have the ""stubble burning"" effect."
2020-06-25 21:56,"If anybody thinks this time of global Pandemic mixed with massive helpings of recession and the historic and long over-needed demonstrations and total readjustments to address racial injustice have been overwhelming than they aren't prepared a micro scintilla  for what's coming our way if we don't deal seriously with Global Warming and now.

Imagine all that we've been through these last 4 months and then mix war, famine, drought, flooding, lost land, fires, washed away houses and so on but for years on end and everywhere.

The IPCC scientists and researchers have warned that unless we do a lot very soon and very worldwide we will face human suffering on a scale never seen before.  Worse than WWII.   If they are just half right let's say, then believe me, you don't want any part of that.

I think we all know now, from these crazy times, that when many people are saying the sky is falling and they are the scientists or ardent critics of political and law enforcement systems, then the sky is probably falling."

2020-06-26 11:17,Of course the Trump administration is going to dispute these findings.  They are myopic because they only act on the basis of what is best for industry.  Public health means nothing to them. Just look at the response to COVID!

Most work hard and took many risks to build something. The question I have is what did the politicians and media think was going to happen when they shut down all this economic activity for months? Oh, the top 0.1% will pay for it all. Doesn’t happen. Not here, and not in Europe."

2020-06-26 22:05,"I live in Sunset Park and it is truly a beautiful neighborhood with people from all walks of life. I want to shout out to the Bodega on the corner that didn't close once during the pandemic. Supplied PPE hand sanitizer etc at cheap, started stocking fresh produce and kept prices low low low.  Many EBT residents rely on them and they showed me what community is all about."
2020-06-26 22:28,Hope these small stores can get back again. What a loss to the community.
2020-06-27 1:12,"I feel most for all the small businesses barely struggling to survive, or which have closed altogether.  While large companies have cash reserves, some are able to operate online, and others get government lifelines, few mom and pop stores get anything.

Even if they wanted to open, or could, would they attract sufficient customers ?

Even in my relatively wealthy neighbhood, the only businesses doing well are supermarkets, and now a handful of restaurants and other take-out eateries.  Most are still closed.  Local stores of large chains have completely closed, some prior to the pandemic.

Few people are on the street.  This being a college town, students drove a significant part of business, all of which has dried out.

Without a vaccine, and lots of government assistance, I don’t see how we can return to anything approaching ‘normal."
2020-06-26 23:41,"Unfortunately it seems Jamaica Ave in Queens is going the same way. Not fair that a clothing shop on the Avenue that has been around since 1987 could not open up, but you could buy clothes in Target and Walmart. Why didn,t they limit Target and Walmart to essestial items only? I am a democrat, but am confounded at the praise directed at Cuomo. He has been a disaster for small business. plus, he will only go on CNN, where the may ask the tough question of him, but then let him pontificate on how great he has done. Because of his brother, it seems the are not permitted to ask any follow up questions. And lets not forget him parading out Chris Rock and Rosie Perez for his daily feel good Covid updates."
2020-06-27 11:59,"These are my neighbors and the people I see every day. Alex helped me carry a box of groceries just a couple weeks ago. I've watched the family from El Rancho talking to families and reassuring them since they reopened. I use to walk by Tony's and see Mr Garofalo at work. The staff at VLS Pharmacy has done a lot to take care of everyone at this time. This is just a sample of how Sunset Park has struggled but bonded in caring for each other. The neighborhood has been hit hard by  Covid and many elderly people on my block died. It seemed imprudent by many for me to say here , but I hoped that what I understood about this place would remain true even in this scary time. And it held. I only hope that these wonderful businesses and so many like them will continue to be here far into the future."

2020-06-25 16:47,"The lack of masks on the clients is concerning.  In order to keep this safe everyone needs to mask up.

I went to a barbershop in NH in May. They did it right - everyone in masks, appointments, sprayed the chair down. Had another haircut in my town center yesterday. Barber put a mask on when I arrived for my appointment. Didn't clean the chair. I'll be driving the 35 minutes to the original barbershop in NH. Safer. Better haircut."
2020-06-25 16:48,"I've had the same stylist for over 35 years now, not just because I get a great cut but getting pampered during the wash and cut is what I miss.

I cut it myself twice now, the first time with a rechargeable trimmer. An oops on the top made for a buzz cut of equal length which really accented my thinning top. My wife bought an electric trimmer so the second time came out much better, leaving the top grow out some.

I'm in need of a haircut again and I haven' decided who will do it, me or my stylist."
2020-06-25 17:25,"I’ve used the Flowbee haircutting system (attaches to a vacuum cleaner) for 30 years, getting perfect haircuts in 10 minutes. I had no hair issues during lockdown. I’ve saved approximately $25,000 in haircuts since I started in 1990."

2020-06-25 17:57,I went to Long Island (just a few miles from where I live) to get a haircut last week as NYC was still closed.  It felt great and it felt like I was finally doing something normal.

2020-06-25 18:06,"My mother used to work in the field for over 45 years, indeed, is more than a business, it is an art.
I have twins kids with developmental disabilities. My girl, who has ASD, has never been in a salon, I cut her hair. My boy is 12 and for the last 7 or more years he is been going to the same barber, in the arcade level at the Chrysler building, who does classic styles, understand angles and uses mostly scissors. I cannot do my son haircut, even though I have the tools and saw my mom working and teaching in a beauty salon school in my country; my boy had plagiocephaly and used a helmet when he was a baby but this unfortunately, didn't correct the issue completely. For my boy, the relationship developed with Yuriy has been beyond therapeutic, it is an intimate relationship where my boy has learned how to trust someone who understand his needs and for him to verbalized what he needs and wants. Our last visit at the barbershop, before the Chrysler building cancelled their lease, I had the opportunity to have a coffee break while my boy was having his haircut. 
We are already planning on continue supporting Yuriy in his new business, meanwhile, my boy will continue using bobby pins to keep his hair out of his eyes."

2020-06-25 18:29,"The customer in this video absolutely should be wearing a mask, both for the safety of the hairdresser and those of others. All customers should be masked except for moments where the hairdresser is dealing with sideburns, beard or around the ears, and the mask would get in the way. 

With the exception of N95 masks, which the barber does not appear to be wearing, masks are more effective at protecting other individuals than they are at protecting the wearer. It is *mutual* mask wearing, not masks worn by only one party, which is protective."
2020-06-25 18:36,"My barber had to close her shop after 35 years. However, she came to my apartment yesterday and cut my hair. We both wore masks and located near an open window. It felt so good to have my hair cut again!"

some back to normal glimpses into hope."
2020-06-25 18:49,"Went 11 weeks without having high/low lights to blend in my greys and am fortunate that I wear my hair long, so no self-trimmed bangs.  Was thrilled to have my hair done and doing something that felt completely like old times (despite our face masks)."

2020-06-25 19:03,"Love this more than human interest story, love; love the before and after pics; love the smiles!  We can all relate to good grooming.  Just like Mr. Cabrera writes, your professional barber or hairstylist is a PT therapist.  It's one of the few times I feel I can say whatever I want about a particular topic and not be judged.  She wants my return business and I want her to listen, which she does!  Thanks for the article.  It was a joy to read."
2020-06-25 19:03,Awesome story.  Great pics.
2020-06-25 19:13,Excellent story. I’m so proud of Autumn and team at the Standard Grooming.
2020-06-25 19:41,"I can appreciate the story, but not the sentiment. I dislike haircuts and tend to put them off. As I approach retirement age, the pandemic has given me the excuse to revisit my long-haired hippie youth, and I might just keep it (if my wife doesn't issue an executive veto)."
2020-06-25 19:44,"It is only at such trying times as Covid-19 that one perceives the importance of visits to barbers, hair salons, and dentists. Today, my wife took a pair of scisors and trimmed my gray-white hair that grew too long on the back and sides of the head. I am grateful to her and happy with the results."

2020-06-25 20:34,"This article was so enjoyable.  Thank you for showing people of all skin colors.  My hair stylist has re-opened, but I haven't gotten on her schedule yet.  My hair is all-one-length, and it has gotten quite long.  It's sort of like a badge of endurance, at the moment.  However, I will eventually have it trimmed back up."
2020-06-25 20:41,"This article and the pictures made me tear up a little, and smile.  I can't wait to get back to my stylist for a nice haircut.  It will be so comforting.  And my dentist - not as much fun, but it will feel like one small thing is right with the world."
2020-06-25 20:45,"Hey, everybody! You look beautiful/handsome/HAPPY.
Barbers, you are bringing all that beauty and HAPPINESS.

2020-06-25 20:59,"I have become a fantastic home barber using a kit my husband purchased at Costco five years ago to keep his sideburns neat. 

 I watched a you tube video for a basic lesson and have cut my husband, college son and father’s hair multiple times in the past few months with some success.  Their heads are living sculptures that  I get to admire throughout the day.

My teenage son however, has refused to let me near his head and instead thought it best to cut his own hair.  
Happily it has already grown out somewhat.

I will miss my pseudo-barber days."
2020-06-25 17:46,Very enjoyable article. Both photos and text.
2020-06-25 17:48,"Enjoyable and uplifting article, especially with major prominence given to Black Americans.  Reading their words, hearing their feelings - a step for many of us to better understand and feel compassion for the lives of people too long ignored."
2020-06-25 18:26,"My most recent visit to the barber was marked by my wife's reaction to the generous tip that I left; ""Well, honey, it's Christmas and she did leave my beard nice and long and full. 
So now it's been six months since the steel has touched my hair. Seeing as how I'm not prepared to take the risk I guess my ""Freak Flag"" is just going to fly. Probably until I get vaccinated. I will survive to vote and I will vote if it kills me."
2020-06-25 18:04,"Are you kidding me!? All those people in the before and after pictures did NOT need haircuts! My hair has not been cut since December. The first 2 months because of being too busy and traveling, then from March on because of the lock down. I still feel _extremely_ uncomfortable going anywhere, let alone the hairdresser. I already heard horror stories about the lack of social distancing and face masks in many hair salons. I think I'll wait for another two months before contemplating non-essential exposure. In the mean time my hair will be long enough for a proper ponytail."

2020-06-25 17:21,"Same 'hair growth' issue even in India. But we are clever. We waited for three months for the saloons to open. But in vain. So we have decided to give the scissors to our better-halves and got a somewhat better haircuts, though the job was not in par with professional hair cutters (barbers). But soon if the scene continues, I mean, if there is no lifting of lockdowns, and if the saloons are not opening, we will train  our women folks in hair cutting still in a better way, and get the work done perfectly in the coming months. Thereby we save some rupees too. (Note: Women do hair cutting. Men do all kitchen work like cooking, cleaning, etc.) After all the life must go on. We learnt how to live with the virus."

2020-06-25 20:31,"After four months of trimming my own hair I can’t wait to get back to the beauty salon.  I can trim the front pretty well by myself, but  the back looks like someone jumped me from behind with a weed whacker."
2020-06-25 21:41,After I finally had my hair cut this last week (after four months) I thought they'd have to bring in the BIG vacuum to get up all the hair!
2020-06-25 23:02,"Really nice article & great photos. 

I'm not quite ready to take ANY risk just to have a haircut (so what if my head looks like a post-storm haystack). 

But when the time comes. I will be sure to take before & after pix."
2020-06-26 1:03,"I talked my (69 y/o) wife into going to a barber I've used in the past.  She got her hair cut very short. I also suggested skipping any coloring job and letting her hair go natural, a very attractive steel grey.  The cut was $10- and the tip was $16- since it was a woman's cut and the stylist had been out of business for the Covid  months. I just cut my own hair tonight with a home haircut kit.  Something I've done many times. At my age, 68, I'm well past the vanity business.  Walmart sells serviceable home haircut kits for about $25-."
2020-06-25 21:20,"I actually like the “befores” better.  (But then, I’m an old hippie myself.)"
2020-06-25 19:10,"There is no reason clients can’t wear masks while they get their hair cut, colored, and styled. I have long, curly hair and my stylist was able to wash it and cut it without any problems while I wore two masks and he wore a mask and shield. I left with wet hair because I didn’t want to spend any more time than necessary in the salon and I was the ONLY one there just as they opened back up! We will never conquer this virus unless everyone wears a mask!"
2020-06-25 18:07,Very pleased to see some of the barbers using a face shield to protect themselves more fully. And those are some fine looking clients :)
2020-06-25 20:22,"Jason and Samuel took 10 years off, easy. Handsome dudes.

Boy, I miss human beings just being able to be human."
2020-06-25 21:23,"I’ve worn my hair short my whole life; “tidy” not Marine-short. My hair has always been anonymous, unremarkable in the literal sense. Since the lockdown it has grown out. It’s wavy (who knew?) and now touches my shirt collar. I’ve had a couple of looks and a few compliments, I like this and I’m not hurrying to the barbers. It’s an Ill wind that blows nobody any good."
2020-06-25 22:39,You guys all look GREAT!. But i am not ready yet. will keep using my clippers at home.
2020-06-25 16:59,"I've been cutting my hair for months now, and won't be going back to a shop.

Now, I was going to a chain for a cut, with no conversation or relationship with the person cutting my hair, so I'm not missing that part.

It's almost entertainment or recreation now.  Every couple of weeks I try something different.  Haven't screwed up yet.  Too much, at least."
2020-06-25 18:27,"During the first three months of the pandemic i stayed home and watched my late Feb cut grow and grow and grow so much i had to keep updating my bitmoji with longer hair. Got my first cut two weeks ago and so did my bitmoji! Mask up, y'all, and stay sane!"

2020-06-25 18:50,This was to early to reopen .  We saw in Springfield Missouri where the the belligerent GOP salon and barbers opened on the lockdown one got 8 workers infected and hundreds of clients.  Another in Pa said he would not wear a mask cutting hair got people infected also.  In a few weeks we will see the cry babies victims say why did i get the virus. It is will full misconduct.  Lock them up when they infect more victims.
2020-06-25 18:42,"Ok, so you got a nice haircut - but no complaining about the government, or the health system, or anything else, when it turns out you infected your family with Covid after not wearing a mask"
2020-06-25 21:03,"""Long Haired"" months.  Some title.  So what??!  Long hair is cool, let it grow!! ""Long beautiful hair...""  ""Give me hair down to there..."".  from ""Hair"" B'way play  and movie.  To think guys want short cropped hair, then as they start losing it in their 30's and 40's they complain about not having hair!! I'm in my early 60's and still let my hair grow, not cutting it for about 30 years, sure i've lost about half my hair but i value and love all that remains. If Nature takes it away fine, but i will let it grow, albeit slowly, what's left of it.  If you have to cut for work, then OK. If you're a punk rocker, then OK, otherwise  stop with this bi-polar approach to hair growth and desire."
2020-06-25 23:51,"What's wrong with people?!  So many clients without masks, even as their hair cutters wear a mask plus a shield to protect themselves.  No respect for these salon workers.  Then again, there is no benefit to a salon worker wearing a mask over his mouth when his nose remains uncovered.  Going to these places is potentially a problem."
2020-06-25 19:07,"Very cool haircut, Ms. Magette ;)"
2020-06-25 17:00,"Does all look so nice. Please, everyone be sure to wear masks and wash hands and use hand sanitizer!"
2020-06-25 17:06,The Standard Grooming Co. in Bushwick totally has its act going. Absolutely loved these before and after shots! And how the beauticians are seriously covered up to protect themselves and their clients. Makes me wish I lived close enough to get mine done. My hair's a scraggly mess.
2020-06-25 18:37,I still won’t go near a barbershop yet. My hair is now below my shoulders.
2020-06-25 19:32,"Why isn’t that client wearing a mask?!  I can’t believe it!
That should not be allowed. Why is all the precaution on
Only one side? And what about the next client?  He will have to breathe 
That air.  For shame!"
2020-06-25 19:43,"I just loooove this story so much!  People being people, good, caring souls looking out for each other.  See, this country is chock a block full of absolutely wonderful people!  Let’s talk more about the good around us!   Let’s drown out Trump with voices of love!  Thank you!"

Thinking I was quick and would have an appointment for that day, turns out ii couldn’t get one until Tuesday at 5:30.  I can’t complain as my wife couldn’t get an appointment at her salon until July 9.  It had been nearly four months since my last cut and I looked like a 1970’s baseball player as hair puffed out from underneath my cap. I went for an extra short cut in case we close down again. Feels great."

2020-07-12 19:08,"Mr. Gelb should notice that when things are free or low cost, people come. They want to hear great singing. At $400 a ticket or even $150, who comes? Productions that cost millions of dollars because, after all, it IS the Met are foolish. Stick to basic productions. Not such lavish costumes, not such complex sets, not so many big wig conductors. MORE WOMEN and POC in all areas of their operation backstage and in the pit. 

AND, particularly on a small screen, people don't care that much about the pomp and circumstance, which gets lost in transition. They care about the singing and the music. So many classical productions are ""updated"" to be ""more interesting"" and""relevant"" when what they are is bizarre, disrespectful or just plain boring. Does Don Giovanni really need to be in the Mob? Does Despina really need to work in a diner? Want to know why young people aren't coming in person? That's a big one.  

The Met could offer ""how to learn to love opera"" broadcasts for people who are curious but don't have the ears to know what to appreciate. Other courses like ""What is a musical theme or motif?"" ""What kind of training do opera singers do?"" ""Why is this certain composer (Mozart, Puccini, Strauss, etc.) important in opera?"" 

If the shutdown forces self-examination upon this stodgy organization, making it more flexible and creative and less ""impressive"", that would be great. And one last thing: please do not hire sub-par singers. Sometimes the singing is bad, too."
2020-06-26 14:10,"NYT, I would like to understand how positive test results are used to reduce new cases
  For example, if I test positive, what legal restrictions are placed on my social movement? If so, what monitoring, enforcement, and penalties are there? Would my contacts by law have to submit to testing?  Would any personal information be used to track me like credit card purchases, cell phone information, private appointment calendars?  What constitutes a positive person becoming ""Safe"".  Is it based on time and symptoms? or multiple negative test results?

This is a fascinating, controversial, and massively important topic and might make an interesting story.  My guess is that the strategy varies widely across the country.

This is not a surprise!

Part of Fauci's nightmare concerning the virus must be that all the warnings he has given about social distancing and wearing masks have been ignored by many.

What could possibly go wrong?"
2020-06-26 14:31,"Here's a puzzle I find baffling that no one has answered yet:

According to the CDC as of yesterday we had conducted 31,281,178 tests. Of these only 2,953,997 have tested positive. That's a ""positivity"" rate of 9.44%.

Now, it's well understood that only those folks who have symptoms that meet the CDC's stringent testing criteria are allowed to proceed to getting tested. They don't test people willy-nilly. 

I can't get tested because apparently I do not have Covid symptoms.

Likewise, many front line healthcare workers (internists, ER doctors, ICU doctors, and nurses) are not allowed to get tested under CDC guidelines.

Thus the millions we have tested to date must have apparently met CDC's testing criteria in the first instance, right?

Why then do only less than 10% of those actually test positive? The other 90% walk away ""infection-free""?

Is it because our tests are not reliable? That is, our tests are in fact producing a large numbers of false negatives when in fact many are truly Covid positive? 

Or, perhaps, doctors are looking at the wrong set of symptoms to determine who gets tested? 

Does this suggest those who did not get test positive initially would need to be re-tested? And perhaps even using an alternate testing procedure?

Or, am I missing something here?"
2020-06-26 14:37,"Sorry, but I find this sudden change of thinking about testing somewhat suspect.  Just days ago, Trump mentioned he wanted less testing to occur and now there's talk about a pool testing approach which ""combines samples from multiple people at once, and would offer a way to minimize the number of tests needed.""

In Trump's Address to the Nation in March, he stated that he ""signed into law an $8.3 billion funding bill to help CDC and other government agencies fight the virus and support vaccines, treatments, and distribution of medical supplies.  Testing and testing capabilities are expanding rapidly, day by day.  We are moving very quickly.""

So, was that simply Trump rhetoric?  It seems as if what he signed into law is not garnering the results he anticipated nor expected.

2020-06-26 14:48,"Pool testing was first proposed back in March, when the pandemic was first exploding here in the U.S. and we hadn't expanded our testing capabilities.  It made sense then as a stop gap measure. Now this is another admission of failure by this administration. If we had a competent President, we would have developed a strategy for testing and producing the necessary materials. Instead, we get a president who denies the basic science.  The persuadable middle voters have a choice, vote for the guy who thought drinking bleach would be something good to study, the guy who thinks testing causes the disease, the guy who said it would all go away like a miracle.  Or don't."
2020-06-26 13:52,"How ironic that, as the number of Covid cases explodes and the pandemic has no end in sight, the Trump administration and the Republican Party barrel forward with their goal to invalidate all of the Affordable Care Act. If they are successful, you will lose your protection from pre-existing condition exclusions, lifetime and annual caps on coverage, and the ability to insure your children until they are 26.  And millions of Americans will lose coverage they got thanks only to Obamacare.  

Many younger Americans have no idea how draconian those exclusions were before the ACA. Years ago, I had a minor neck injury in an auto accident (not my fault). I asked about the pre-existing condition exclusions in my policy, using a hypothetical example: if I were to be hit by a truck and fractured my spine, would I have coverage. I was told that, due to my prior neck injury, I had NO coverage for ANY spinal injuries of any type. Likewise. without the ACA, you could be excluded for insured care for any and all medical problems that an insurance company could conceivably tie to a prior illness from Covid. 

Trump and Republicans keep saying that they will “replace” the ACA.  However, they have had years to do so, yet they haven’t made one serious attempt to amend or improve it.  So, when they say”trust me,” don’t fall for it.  Vote for Vice-President Biden and every Democrat running for office in November - it’s a vote for basic decency, honesty, and government that works for us."

This, as Texas, one of the pandemic's hardest hit states to date, led 20 other states in the original lawsuit against Obamacare.  So to add to this dreadful, inept, negligent Trumpian debacle of death and disease, our country is now at the mercy of the Supreme Court.  It will take five justices to decide not only the fate of the ACA but also the fate of MILLIONS of Americans who may become more vulnerable to the destruction wrought by this coronavirus, not to mention most other acute and chronic diseases.

Testing large numbers of people for the virus whether they have symptoms or not will give us solid evidence of how prevalent the virus is in our population, something that is only a guess right now.  With solid numbers we can take actions that target critically infected people.    

Obviously, Donald Trump is out of the loop on this as he continues to attack the idea of testing itself though it is only through testing that he himself can have any confidence that he is virus free.  Each of us whether with symptoms need that same confidence if we are to move forward in our daily lives."
2020-06-26 14:55,"Too little, too late. Doing pooled testing with so many new cases now will likely be fruitless, since so many of the pools would be expected to have at least 1 person test positive. On top of that, consider that it's taking 3-7 days to get test results. After a week's time, given the breadth of how the virus is now spreading in many places, pools that test negative at the beginning of a week, could very well have someone who's picked up the virus by the time the pool's results are back. And, further on top of that, for every pool of 20 that tests positive, you then need to test all 20 people. Is anyone believing there'd be enough testing capacity to test every individual in every pool that comes back positive?

This is grasping at straws by Trump and his administration. They've completely squandered the last 7 months. In fact, they've done worse than nothing with their denials and spreading of lies and misinformation.

The rest of the world has flattened the coronavirus curve by having sensible leaders enacting sensible health care measures. 

Not Trumo!

There's an intimacy. 3) Bars are noisy so you HAVE to stand close and you have to SHOUT, spewing droplets on each other. 4) Bars are all about alcohol, which lowers inhibitions and encourages risk taking, encourages you to stand close, and encourages you to talk loud (and spew droplets). Lots of businesses can be opened and conducted safely. It's hard to imagine a way a bar could be safe."

2020-06-26 15:44,"I'd be very interested in the Times explaining the process that Governor Abbott is following to determine the restrictions and policies he's implementing.

As somebody who never left New York City when covid took off, I think what made Governor Cuomo's response to the initial outbreak so brilliant was not only that he developed (and stuck to) a comprehensive strategy based on science and data that guided his decision-making, but also that he communicated that strategy to the people of New York with complete and total transparency to earn our buy-in and compliance. He explained absolutely everything.

The communication part was critical because, at the end of the day, it was up to people to act safely and because, once the data started showing positive results, we felt personally connected to the success. That connection positively reinforced the actions we took and helps ensure that we will continue to be smart as we reopen.

We weren't punished by restrictions against our will for something we didn't believe was an issue. We were active participants in solving something we all agreed was a major problem.

I haven't read or seen anything similar coming from Governor Abbott (or from any other governors from the current hot states).

Why bars? Why restaurants at half capacity? What's next if this doesn't do enough? What else is being done? What is he doing to earn popular buy-in? Will the people respond favorably?

Tell us more about what he's doing."

She finally flew to Kuwait two weeks ago. She said that she was on an Army bus and she was the only one wearing a mask. She was supposed to fly back to the US last week, but a paper wasn’t signed, so she is waiting another two weeks in Kuwait. 
When she returns to the U. S. she will have to quarantine in Texas for two weeks before she can go home to the state that she lives in, which is asking people coming from hotspots like Texas to quarantine for two weeks. 
I knew that the government and army were inefficient and lacked critical thinking skills, but this is ridiculous. 
She is being payed five weeks with our tax dollars to watch Netflix. She is not working at all. 
She was in Jordan, a country that was able to quickly flatten the curve. Now she is going to progressively more active covid sites before she can come home.

The beach and the rivers a aren't going anywhere. The bars and restaurants will close, go bankrupt and then someone else will reemerge after Covid-19. I feel sorry for those with careers in the wrong industry, who are being severely impacted by Covid-19. But, right now, it's every man for himself until better leadership steps in and beings doing what Trump lacks the intelligence, empathy, compassion and brains to do. I chose to stay home.

2020-06-26 15:55,"I hope our Governor will finally stop asserting the ""false choice"" of saving the economy vs fighting the virus. We are now going back to shut-down mode while cases are out of control, none of this had to happen. It is very evident here in Texas that the failure to take reasonable steps to genuinely fight the virus is now having worse economic effects than the ""open it all up"" approach. Fortunately the major cities in Texas actually have fairly forward-thinking leadership, they led the charge but were (are) repeatedly stymied by the Governor and the Lt. Governor. This is the second time the Governor has (belatedly) capitulated to the pleas of the Mayors and County Judges of San Antonio, Austin, Dallas, Houston and the Valley. The first time he put it on the local leaders to mandate a shut down and only stopped fighting them once it became obvious things were spiraling. Then he overruled them and ""opened up Texas for business"" as he put it. After a month of fighting the mayors and county judges, he has now capitulated on the mask requirements as things spiral; but, again, instead of showing leadership, he is putting in on the local leaders to establish the mandates as he tries to find political cover from his base.  Governor Abbott gets it, he is not like our President. But at some point you have to put politics aside, do what is right, and deal with the fallout from that Republican core base they are all so afraid of."

Abbott made two mistakes and deserves to be booted out of office. The first was not organizing and mandating reasonable procedures when he reopened. The second was listening to Trump who appears to have no regard for human life. As a medical professional, masks are not a political thing. It's just plain stupid to risk your own health and the health of your neighbors and families. Unfortunately, we're stuck with Abbott until 2022 but we can rid of Trump in just a few months.

They could have avoided this entire disaster if their priority had been taking care of their citizens instead of following Donald Trump into his fairyland alternate universe.

The weight of this unnecessary suffering and death is more than Ducey, DeSantis and Abbott can ever make good on. They have failed their states and should resign immediately.

The very least they can do is to stop trying to justify their disastrous mismanagement and adopt the measures proven to work in the states that are actually recovering.

As a native Floridian, I can tell you that people do not congregate outside during the summer in the southern states like they do in the northern ones.  96 degree temperatures with 99% humidity sends people running for the AC so the decrease hoped for by people being outside doesn't hold true for those states.  Since it is still spreading in the northern states, the heat is obviously not stopping this virus like it does the flu."

2020-06-26 15:58,"But what about freedom, governor? Remember way back two months ago when Republicans were out on the streets with their guns, ready to overthrow the republic if we didn’t reopen? Are Republicans calling the governor and telling him the cure is worse than the disease, or is that message just for democratic governors?  That message doesn’t go over so well when your hospitals are overflowing, now does it?  The Republicans just spread this disease all over America with their premature ill-advised reopening, created a healthcare catastrophe and tanked the economy. And now they want the Supreme Court to drop health insurance for over 20 million Americans. What a nightmare."

I would remind my Democratic friends that when Trump is defeated in November there will still be millions of conservative people in the US.  We must find a way to work with them.

Just reporting cases is a little disingenuous at this point."

And Germany and other countries in Europe are also considering ""pool testing?"" I read Merkel was confident their already successful test/contact tracing program would be able to control any new flare ups with their reopening. I would think the ""pool testing"" is less precise than contact tracing all positives, but a a second best strategy for countries  whose cases are too numerous for the capabilities of their contact tracing programs."

There should have been a national strategy and a recovery plan to attack this virus and its impact. Lives and jobs would not have been lost. The Defense Production Act could have focused on manufacturing masks and everyone should have been REQUIRED to wear masks when outside. We can still do that and get the economy back in shape.

It was a ridiculously lenient ordinance. The police would have had an awful time enforcing it. 
Still, it would have been better than nothing. But, this is Trumpville and the mentality to go with it. 
We have multiple meat processing plants in our area and have gone from 25 cases in mid May to over a thousand with hundreds in quarantine.
The Hispanic population mostly work these industries in our areas and the infection spreads quickly. Often, several  generations live under one roof. 
It's an emergency situation for these folks and for everyone else. 
Our public health officials are doing everything they can to contain the outbreak without the cooperation of the ignorant, bigoted, white conservative population. 
They don't stop and think where their chicken and pork comes from or who shows up to slaughter and process it. It's not white folks. They won't do those jobs. 
The Hispanic population here is hard working, contributing so much to our community yet they are being dealt a death blow by the virus. 
But no masks. No distancing. No requirements. No real cooperation from the white community.

And to see that the leadership in the highest levels of my government have entirely squandered the nation’s generosity in offering that sacrifice makes my blood boil.

At least Trump won't be appearing to spew more false information although he just can't help himself with that Twitter account of his -  that this pandemic is ""over"" and that ""Embers or flare ups will be put out as necessary.""

Good grief.  Everything has to be quick, easy, and a snap of one's fingers for any problem to go away in Trump's brain.

Thank you Dr. Fauci."

I'm sure he'll start off with some words of comfort to worried and anxious Americans who are scared about their health and losing their jobs. 

Next, I'm certain he'll truthfully address the current Covid-19 numbers and won't minimize it or ignore any concerns or questions. 

I'm sure he'll announce new meaningful nationwide measures that will tamp down the pandemic. 

And finally, I just know he'll appear at the briefing proudly wearing a mask and telling all Americans they should do the same.

Speaking of lies, I hadn't watched Tucker Carlson in a while. And I think every American owns it to themselves to go on over to Fox and take a look at what he's been up to, because you will realize, after about two minutes, that Carlson is in the same moral and ethical group as Alex Jones, only with a much bigger audience.

So watch a few minutes, and find out about how Trump predicted all of this years ago: the coronavirus outbreak, the burning down of dozens of American cities, the endless looting, etc, etc, etc, and how Trump is still the only one that can save us from what he and everyone else predicted would happen if a Democrat ever got into office - the end of the world.

And then I suggest you turn it off, delouse, and make yourself one extremely large cocktail.

Not any more.
The US States first mistake was to assume that the covid-19 is a Chinese or Asian problem.  That Trump continue to attempt to link the Covid-19 to China only help divert the attention that United States is now number one in numbers infected, will soon be number 1 in number deaths linked to Covid-19 virus, a virus that can be rendered essentially harmless if people would be willing to wear masks, wash their hands regularly for 20 seconds, keep social distancing, and to limit the amount of time one stay in large group in indoor settings."

2020-06-26 16:50,"I suspect that we’re seeing more cases of Covid-19 because, in an effort to reduce public anxiety and panic, the nature of transmission of the underlying virus, SAR-CoV-2, was never fully presented. This has led to skepticism of  the guidance provided. The virus is primarily created in the lungs and expelled from the lungs. Transmission of the disease is not limited to a sneeze or a cough.  Although the social distancing guidelines can help reduce transmission of the virus, those, together with  recommendations of the use of masks, are not foolproof. For instance, specific distance spacing of six feet, may seem a bit arbitrary to some because, depending on the circumstances, it is. Present sober facts for a more sober response. Don’t herald the vaccine to come. Instead, focus on the triage."

Trump’s defiance of testing protocols, mask wearing and stay at home orders is consistent with what he has always believed: that the virus should be permitted to “wash through” our population.  He is a believer of herd immunity. In any event, he understands that voter’s minds will be made up in October, maybe late just before he election.(remember the Comey letter?)
Trump is hoping that the worst of the serious cases and deaths will peak by the end of the summer. His hope is that by October he will be able to claim that he had the courage to confront the virus...that Americans are warriors along with him....and that it has been defeated. Trump wants to point to a recovering economy in the fall.
BTW he has already tweeted that as reported cases increase, the death rate has drastically gone down.
Note that he asked for 4 debates with Biden and settled on 3. He has the confidence that over several debates he will reveal Biden’s weaknesses and his strength.
Sure, Trump’s “master plan” may fail; Trump understands that; he also knows that this strategy is the best he can do...
Yes, he cares little about the currently rising death and hospitalization toll...that is the evil in him...not proof of his stupidity."

As far as I am concerned, Trump and Pence have actually acted to promote the spread of the virus and to impede scientifically based action to stop the virus. For example, Trump was saying only a few days ago that he wants to reduce testing. I imagine it is because it makes him look bad. All Trump cares about is Donald Trump. He could care less about any human being other than himself. Suffering, illness and death of others seem to mean nothing to Trump.

What we don’t know: The long term health effect that the virus will cause after recovery. 
How to enforce common sense public health safety measures without people having hissy fits.

My take: Political pressure and lack of responsible leadership from the top down is our main problem in getting this pandemic under control. “American exceptionalism” is proving that we have a long road bumpy road ahead.

Trump had “all but given up even talking about” the coronavirus pandemic that has now killed more than 125,000 people nationwide, the board said. His “default now is defensive self-congratulation.”"

2020-06-26 18:01,"DeSantis may be trying to alleviate economic consequences here in Florida, but there are going to be even worse economic consequences if this continues to worsen and/or recurs in the Fall, given that our economy is very dependent on tourism and Northern snowbirds who might go elsewhere if they feel their health is at risk in Florida.

2020-06-26 18:01,"It’s clearly young people spreading disease throughout the community. The data speaks for itself. These people aren’t Trump supporters and wouldn’t listen to him whatever he said. So all the fixation on Trump and his lack of mask wearing is getting more and more absurd. Public health is largely a state and local issue, the governors can do almost whatever they want. Are they willing to crack down on the young people killing their own communities."

2020-06-26 17:57,"The people who died from March to May were victims of the US getting caught unprepared. The effort to rein in the chaos was heroic. 

The people getting sick and dying now are the result of government indifference, incompetence and a total lack of concern for the value of life. The states infected now squandered their lockdown with no testing or useful policy.

The people dying now are cannon fodder in election politics. There is a place somewhere near fire and ice waiting for them."

2020-06-26 18:00,"The ""Coronavirus task force"" has literally done nothing since its formation. After 2 months they finally take the podium and have the gall to feign frustration over the CDC's handling of testing. 

This is the trump administration's response to everything:
1. Do nothing but claim invisible successes
2. Bloviate about 'Merica's awesomeness
3. When the gas lighting fails, shift blame to others
4. Rinse and repeat 

Remember the name and face of every single administration lackey who has failed the American public. If you see them in public do not let them forget it."

Over 124 thousand people have died and the US is moving towards topping the list of all other countries in the number of cases and deaths, maybe even top the total of all countries. These deaths and the continuous growth is on tRump and his disdain for doing anything FOR THE PEOPLE OF THE USA. He's done with the virus. He is focusing on being re-elected, decreasing the numbers by trying to get rid of testing and now, ACA.

Wake up base (while you are still alive). You may not believe the virus exists because you aren't sick, but if you get it, you need to see who is leading the troops. It's not the democrats, it's not Biden or Obama, it's not the protesters, it's the leader you continue to love. Also, if you get sick, good luck going to your doctor if you are under ACA. Better go to the doctor now before you lose your coverage."
2020-06-26 17:48,"Pence is so under the influence of Trump that he cannot answer a simple and obvious question about the importance of wearing masks.  He just deferred this question to local leaders.   Is he that afraid of a tongue lashing by Trump that he cannot state the obvious?  Asking this man a question is a complete waste of time, he is a master of deflecting (although he did say to keep praying...)"

How many people went without their rheumatoid arthritis or lupus treatment because of a presidential whim (or investment gift to himself or his buddies?)"
2020-06-26 17:58,"Pence's  ""freedom of speech response"" was nonsense. 

Trump didn't need to hold a rally.  Choosing not to have a rally wouldn't forfeit his freedom of speech.

He is on board with intentionally causing harm and killing us, and pulling the levers to do so.  Is this not genocide?"

New York is stable on a very low rate concerning the virus spread and has flattened the curve... and there were protests in New York too (not rioting), so that cannot be the sole answer. Maybe being packed in bars and restaurants without masks has something to do with it?"

In the absence of all this and more, Pence and the fools in the administration stifled medical directives and cast off the pandemic (and masks) as a political annoyance. Negligence of this scale, resulting in thousands of preventable deaths and devastating bodily injuries, merits criminal charges against those responsible. It’s as if they are returning today to the scene of their crimes. This administration has committed crimes against the world, against humanity."
2020-06-26 17:42,"Dr. Fauci gave sane advice on scientifically-sound ways to address the spiking numbers of cases in the US.

And, for the ones not working and are just living a life of leisure, where are they going if not the shops, restaurants, bars, and public places that were opened for business?"
2020-06-26 17:49,"pence flattering on about less deaths than before because something is working. Not his Bain, if he had one. Deaths come 2 weeks after infections at most. Young people out at bars and pool events, what was suppose to happen? I hope someones sues them for negligence."

125,000 dead Americans and their friends and families should provide the 'grade' on Trump and Azar's response, although verdict is a better descriptor."
2020-06-26 18:04,"Someone please help Trump and his shadow Pence.  Anyone who talks just about “testing” doesn’t understand the concept.  You test in order to trace and isolate, which in turn reduces the spread.  In bemoaning increased testing, Trump is bemoaning reducing the spread.  Except he doesn’t get that, and never will."
2020-06-26 17:58,"OK, so ""Mr. President is leading the the country during Pandemic"" Pence. Can you answer two basic questions: 

1) The spike in virus happens in high population density, hence saying there are few counties only, that happened in March in only few counties in NY, NJ as well. So do not down play, when it comes to red states, that there are only few counties?
2) If campaign rallies cannot be stopped on local government urging because of ""freedom of speech"", tell me why protestors were moved out of DC with force when Trump went for a walkaround  to the church?

You cannot speak from both ends to defend the indefensible."
2020-06-26 17:58,The only way to stop this virus from ramping up in the fall is a mandated NATIONWIDE quarantine scheduled for two weeks in the near future (give everyone time to load up on supplies to ride out the two weeks). A patchwork of lockdowns is NOT going to work!

2020-06-26 17:51,Wall Street is facing what could be a prolonged recession due to the fact that pandemic has not been brought down as in the EU.  If a second wave arrives the recession will be around even longer.  The growth in economic inequality will continue the decline in consumer spending.  The big tech behemoths that are an anti trust nightmare continue to grow.  When the Fed stimulus hit Wall Street they became decoupled from the economy the average American lives in.
2020-06-26 17:50,"Such high praise and back slapping of how wonderful the president's leadership has been during this pandemic could not be more nauseating if not misleading.

It was akin to someone observing that while the Titanic continued to take on more and more water, it still had its lights on . . . as it broke in half while sinking to the bottom of the ocean.

This press conference was designed for one thing and one thing only - to tell Trump's base that all is right with the world while this administration has the pandemic well in hand, under control, and promising and encouraging results will be forthcoming.

The promises made today by Vice President Pence will be as hollow and empty as the ones President Trump promised at his press conference in March.

These folks talk a good and convincing game.  They just never follow through nor deliver what they promise or what they claim to be true."
2020-06-26 17:58,"I just spent an hour watching 4 medical doctors on the White House Coronavirus Task Force talk to the nation about the need to practice the well known guidelines of mask wearing, social distancing, and hand washing. Then the Vice President starts taking questions and the first one is why he and President's campaign aren't practicing these guidelines. He gives a nonsensical answer and we're back where we started. Both he and the President are politically and morally culpable for this disaster that has overtaken the nation. They cannot lead us out of this, even with a team of highly accomplished specialists trying to help them."
2020-06-26 17:11,"It's amazing, the consequences of Trump's presidency and the blame that falls squarely on the voters.  He leads sans brains and conscience and was elected by voters who represent themselves, sans brains and conscience.  In democracy, when the people make a mistake, the people must be punished or they never learn.  People are dying and losing everything, they have worked their whole lives to build and if they survive, will have nothing but a hard lesson to show for it.  That hard lesson is all we have left and we'd better make it count, damn it!"

Or maybe it just makes him sound, to himself and dimwitted followers, like he's ""with it"" in order to impress young techies who like to use this word? Whatever his reasons, someone should inform VPOTUS that the contemporary term ""positivity"" applies to a state of mind, not increasing plus number of anything. And some of us know it. I guess it's like an insurance company telling you your premiums are going up because you're underrated. Sounds warm and fuzzy as they empty your wallet.

                                               2015 - Rick Perry

This braggadocio continues with Texas always having to be the 'biggest', the 'first', the 'best', blah, blah, blah.

So, when King-Corona-Trump issued his call for the country to re-open its economy, Texas jumped right out there as fast as it could.  Except in this case, it couldn't be the 'first' because of Georgia (drats).  Nevertheless, Texas proceeded headlong (albeit in 2nd place) on its economic recovery journey to nowhere.  Ill-conceived plans to re-open restaurants, bars, businesses, theaters, etc., totally ignored the scientific data acquired by leading health agencies.  

And, so here we are today in Texas in late June 2020.....back in 'first' place, on a path to unpredictable, deadly calamity. 
 
My offered solution:  IGNORE Trump at all costs.  IGNORE all politicians at all costs. STICK to the medical data, and follow your gut instincts.

Of course COVID-19 deaths are a lagging indicator, where people may be in the hospital for 30 agonizing days before passing away, but that will be a new news cycle. More peacetime deaths than any other administration? One shutters to think what Trump might do to deflect the news from that."

Many of my peers (31) have been diligently wearing masks, social distancing, and quarantining as much as possible. We call our parents and lecture them if they reveal they've sat on a patio for dinner. We spend most of our days poring over the news and anxiously awaiting a loved one over 60 revealing they have a cough or fever. On the other hand, with the massive reopenings happening around the city, I've also seen staggering crowds of people out at restaurants and bars, young, middle-aged, and old, and it's absolutely enraging. They are frequently not wearing masks or social distancing.

We need strong leadership in this moment. Lori Lightfoot was doing alright with containing covid, but I am disappointed out how quickly the state has thrown in the towel. The government can more than afford to provide ongoing economic support so that people who work in the service industry etc are able to continue staying at home and not have their livelihood depend on risking a wider spread, to themselves and others. 

My partner is 38 and came down with covid 13 weeks ago. He can still barely walk around the block and has had severe post-viral issues. Even if you are in the under-40 bracket, do not be blithe about this disease. It is heartbreaking to watch an otherwise healthy young man struggle so much."

Good luck.

2020-06-26 18:16,"Pence forgot to take credit today for the fact that the U.S. is still far ahead of Brazil, India and Russia.

My guess is he’s leaving that to the President."
2020-06-26 18:19,"The Governor's of Florida,  Texas and Arizona made it clear early on that commerce was more important than lives.   The President continues to assert we are ""winning"",.  The Genie is out of the bottle.  Trumps lack of leadership is costing lives. jobs,  and damaging the economy more than if we had had a complete shutdown in March.  In my state we have Sheriffs saying if people follow the Governor's directive on masks people are ""sheep""..  A City Councilman in Phoenix mocked wearing a mask while bleating ""I can't breath"".   No wonder so many are not taking tbis serioulsly.  The President and his followers made this a political issue.   They have been criminally negligent."

2020-06-26 18:21,"Fauci: “...people want to get back to normal.”
Fauci: (paraphrase) ‘...young people are less worried about the virus and do not want masks, understandably.’

No we don’t; and no, it is not understandable.  I, and many people known to me, have absolutely zero desire to ‘go back to’ normal.  Who in their right mind would want to resume total income inequality, rampant racism, and being a customer treated like a door mat by basically all companies?  And experts in the public eye must stop pandering to young people, stop soothing the little tyke’s self-important egos, order them to wear masks in public under the real promise of big fines and social media shaming.  Only then will their situation be ‘understandable’."
2020-06-26 18:23,How can this be? I just watched Pence and his happy warriors (except Fauci) give an update on the virus and everyhing seems under control. Nice charts too.
2020-06-26 18:23,This administration is still in denial about the virus. I'm not surprised about any of this. The administration is totally incompetent. November can't come fast enough.
2020-06-26 18:21,"trump whines that Obama was “grossly  incompetent""! This from a man who left the nation totally vulnerable and in a place of ""catch up"" instead of ""prevention"" to the pandemic crisis. This from the a who recklessly and deliberately dismantled all the important measures the previous administration had taken to  protect the nation from the 2014 Ebola infection crisis and guard against other possible infection situations in the future. And this from a man who who now is actually blocking the capacity for national action to contain the current mess! Talk about  gross incompetence!
The nation is living through a failure of presidential leadership so epic, so sweeping  that recovery will be a formidable task. Every facet of the trump legacy is so toxic that it must be expunged and destroyed completely."
2020-06-26 18:22,"What to Florida and Texas have in common? Republican Governors who were late to even acknowledge the need for social distancing and when they finally did, they were among the first to open their doors.

2020-06-26 18:22,I don’t get Floridians. They have lovely weather year round unlike us in the North. They can go out between Nov and March while we are shivering from the cold and forced indoors. Only in summer does it get too humid - why not stay home with the A/C? Plus so many homes have pools.
2020-06-26 17:33,"Watching the briefing. Can't say I missed them. The TF just picked up from where they left off. Disinformation, deflection, propaganda, sychopathy, data manipulation. Paul Joseph Goebbels would have given the TF an A grade. Playing to the gallery of one. Vote."
2020-06-26 18:31,"Fortunately these are young people who are now contracting the virus, and the elderly seem to be keeping themselves safer. The overall death rate should decline now, daily. The young must be careful not to infect their elders, but I have confidence in the new generation because it is so social justice and community oriented."
2020-06-26 18:31,"The primary responsibility of the government is to protect its people. The death and infection rate reflects the competency of governance. In that, what has the US to show for is the failure of democratic system under which citizens are incapable to manage its own affair."
2020-06-26 18:34,"So, one in every 2400 Floridians are getting the virus every day now.

Maybe in a week that number will be one in every 1000 Floridians. And in a month, one in every 100.

But Floridians say, Who Cares. Open it all up. NOW! Since those that are most affected by this virus are more than 50 years old, Who Cares.

The strong majority of Floridians follow exactly what Trump says regarding no need for masks, no need for social distancing, and no need for testing. All while the virus is still raging with no end in sight and no vaccine.

November 3, 2020 cannot arrive quick enough."
2020-06-26 19:07,"I don't doubt that the W.H.O. needs money to ""speed production of a vaccine"" but $27.9 billion of which $13.7 billion is needed urgently?

Those amounts are thrown around like the change in our living room sofa and front car seats.  I'd love to actually see where and how this money is being allocated.  I mean, good grief that's a lot of green to request."
2020-06-26 19:20,"Given that the Trump Administration still can’t bring itself to get the message out that large public gatherings should be avoided for now, perhaps our nation’s governors should unite in a full force nationwide marketing campaign to convince the young, and that foolhardy segment of our older population, on their critical need."
2020-06-26 19:38,"The ""United States of America"" are anything but. The European Union consists of countries speaking different languages & having substantially different histories, customs & cultures. Their individual governments are managed differently with differing philosophies. However, they are more ""united"" in fundamental ways than are the 50 states & territories. The only reason the US wants to be the US (ie ""united"") is to justify its wars & its needs for territorial & capitalistic expansion into countries which do not want it or its violent. individualistic culture. Perfectly personified in DJ Trump."
2020-06-26 19:43,"“The W.H.O. said it needs $27.9 billion to speed production of a vaccine.”

While I am perplexed by that enormous amount, I am more curious about whether this means that the W.H.O. is developing its own vaccine, or is it redirecting this money toward select private efforts.

Though the most important thing is that we get a viable vaccine sooner rather than later, this doesn’t mean we should entirely shy away from asking about cost, intent and method."
2020-06-26 12:35,"Yesterday Mr McCarthy blasted the press for asking about Trump's calling the virus the Kung Flu. Well Mr McCarthy, I've been a Republican all of my life. I'm 72, in good health, and I take no medicine. I live in the state of Texas and I'm afraid of this virus. And, yes, I'm very upset with a president who is making jokes when my life is on the line every day for the last 4 months, and still counting. So, Mr McCarthy, if you are worried about America like you said, you better inform this president so that he understands the severity of this virus and quit making jokes, or saying this virus is under control, or going away. If we're going to really help America, let's start there."
2020-06-26 14:03,"Texas is one of the lead states appealing the Supreme Court to overturn the Obamacare law. The lieutenant governor of Texas, Dan Patrick, recently declared in response to question about protecting state residents against the virus that there were more important things than living. John Cornyn, Senator from Texas, said he would not be in favor of sending more stimulus checks to citizens and would prefer instead that the government send money to oil and gas companies.  Greg Abbott, governor of Texas, declared yesterday that the last thing the state wanted to do was close down businesses.  The recent spike in corona virus infections in Texas is nearly vertical.

If all of America follows the patterns and attitudes found in Texas, we'll see infections skyrocket, businesses remain open, citizens receive no financial help from the government,  the poor receive no healthcare coverage while  oil and gas companies receive free money. All while being told there are more important things than living.

Throughout Texas, you see the slogan ""Don't mess with Texas."" Well, Texans, ""Don't mess with America."""
2020-06-26 18:46,"It is not just Floridians, Texans etc. that are cavalier about distancing. I see it every day in NJ.  Any urgency that may have existed in April has vanished.  After two months of absolutely no income for my small business I find I need to reestablish contact with clients.  Only older and more vulnerable individuals seem to have concerns about the virus.  I've had several people even offer handshakes and  fist bumps.  The younger set is wildly oblivious that a health crisis still exists but an uncomfortable number of middle aged people are quite willing to flaunt the recommendations of health professionals and ignore the 6 foot rule.   I assumed wearing  a mask would signal my stance but old habits die hard for many people.  They still want  to get to close and familiar."
2020-06-26 17:33,"We live in Orange County (Orlando) Florida. My 27 year old daughter learned this past Monday morning that she had recently been exposed to Coronavirus. She spent the whole day trying to find a facility that hadn’t run out of the test (she went to four) to finally get tested at 5 pm and that was after she had to wait in her car in a parking lot for 4 hours in 100 degree heat for the clinic to get more tests.

She is one of the fortunate ones. She has a car with working air conditioning, no children to arrange childcare for and an understanding workplace that gave her time off to get this done. 

Those without transportation or the ability to spend 8 hours chasing the test all over town don’t stand a chance to get tested. I’m convinced Florida’s high numbers are actually a fraction of the true outbreak here."
2020-06-26 20:14,I support Dr Fauci for President and wouldn't that be great to have somebody in there that large majority of Americans respect.

The states run by the nitwit Republican governors following the orders of the goon in the WH and having ignored science and not followed the lead of the NY and NJ governors who shut down their states totally and then have re-opened slowly  are now reaping what their stupidity has sowed -- soaring infection rates and followed by overwhelmed hospitals and more deaths.  Meanwhile the babbling buffoon in the WH has totally turned his back on the crisis that he and his administration created and continue to mismanage."

What, in the name of all that's holy, possessed you to vote this man into office in 2016??? I quit my job back then, partly because of the election of DJT and all the things that I knew would come, and the depression that knowledge caused me.

Today I am again unemployed, partly in order to save my life, because it's not all fun and games over here either. But even I would not have _dreamed_ that any person in the world could be so inept, corrupt, uncaring, plain evil, narcissistic, stupid, disinterested and yucky as your current president!

And there is no help from the legislative branch, the failed impeachment made that clear. Boy, I can only hope that these guys get punished in November too! How can you sit idly by and let this proto-dictator trample your country literally to death? Because you are afraid of a _tweet_???

2020-06-26 14:54,"Pool testing. Why does Fauci not suggest testing neighborhood sewage waters? Then if they find the virus from their very suspect tests, they can go ahead and test the whole neighborhood. Wait, an even better idea, why not conduct surprise tests in beach restrooms. You can simply get scientists to siphon the contents of the toilet discretely back and if it gives a positive, well gate the beach, trap the folks, offer to give free bleach injections. Surely the White House must have stock piled it by now. Never did I imagine we would be faced with such incompetent medical leaders and worse an incredibly foolish citizenship. 

Please don’t bother reading about silly studies on gym users being free from corona in Norway. A two week study.....really science has become a comedy the world over. Instead use your own common sense, mask up, take your vitamins. Ensure it has at least 1000iu Vit D, take extra C, make sure it has the entire Bcomplex panel. Eat healthy, introspect, avoid parties. Let the idiots get covid, if they acquire anything remotely like herd immunity, then the rest of us who are mindful will be safe. 

And the hurried vaccines....I’d like to see the entire load of scientists at every governmental organization line up and take it first. Of course alongside the President, his henchmen, the Senate.

Collectively, we have a national attention span that is shorter than a gnat's.  We think that anything ""bad"" will go away just because we want it to and so we ""forget"" about it.

Like children who spent all their class time cutting up in the back of the room we've learned nothing about science.  Heck, we found biology class to be boring except maybe for that one short class presentation about sex.  And even then we made jokes rather than learned.

Now we are paying the price.  We never cared about civics or history and so have chosen to be led by an egotistical idiot who's surrounded himself with sycophantic clowns.  They are incapable of providing adult leadership and direction because they are a reflection of what we are -- overgrown children.

It is not going to get better.  We will throw a national tantrum if we are denied our ""wants"" even as they pose a fatal consequence to our ""needs"".

2020-06-26 19:35,"""Professor"" Irwin Corey (July 29, 1914 – February 6, 2017) was an American stand-up comic billed as ""The World’s Foremost Authority"".   

Like Trump, he made observations of everything.  He made no sense and gave long-winded, nonsensical performances (available on youtube).  

The Professor babbled total nonsense.   But he posed no threat to the USA or the World, unlike Trump who babbles total nonsense about the coronavirus, and other issues that affect human lives, and who is a clear and present threat to the USA and the World.

The NYT described the ""Professor's"" babble as  ""… a series of bad jokes and mangled syntax which left some people roaring with laughter and others perplexed [November 11, 1996].”  

That could be written about Trump but only the ignorant are laughing with any sense of joy."
2020-06-26 20:01,"The Covid virus is a Democratic political hoax done to unseat Trump and all those rising Covid cases and Covid deaths in Republican states proves it. Or perhaps proves it is not a Democratic hoax. Fact is, not a single fact will convince Republican voters they elected a small-bore loser."
2020-06-26 18:46,Remember the good old days when it was all just a hoax
2020-06-26 19:10,Don't worry. Trump can crack more racist jokes. Engage in theatrical warmongering with China. That will make everything better.

2020-06-26 18:59,Covid-19 spiking and the current administration asks the U.S. Supreme Court to strike down the ACA.
2020-06-26 20:06,Brit and Fauci are standing behind Pence wearing face masks.  Pence is talking about what a great job they have done so far and does not have a mask on or even around his neck.  Tells you everything.
2020-06-26 19:45,"Nothing, but nothing, about the so-called ""task force"" is reassuring.  Dr. Birx lost her credibility a long time ago (remember how she praised DJT for his ability to ""synthesize"" information and come to a justifiable conclusion?).  That little episode, along with many others, makes her a person I can never look to with any confidence for credible scientific answers.

Dr. Fauci, unfortunately, is in the same sinking boat ~ at least for me.  Early on, he said that those needing testing and unable to receive it were outliers.  He compounded that ridiculous statement with repeatedly saying there would most likely be a second wave -- and much worse than the first.  Now he says that a second wave isn't inevitable.  Really?  He, too, has hewn too closely to the Trump line, and in doing so, made himself look foolish.  

Didn't ANY of these previously respected physicians/researchers understand that on their own they would have much more credibility than standing shoulder to shoulder with Trump and his puppet, Mike Pence.

Shame on all of them.  Lying, shading their answers, walking back previous statements ~ how in the heck do they expect anyone to take them seriously?!"
2020-06-26 19:37,"Can you imagine someone so lazy, uncaring and self-absorbed that he refuses to wear a mask knowing that simply doing so could save tens of thousands of lives?  How can even 40% be willing to support such a poor excuse for a dog-catcher, nevermind a President.

As for Pence, imagine being the Assistant Dog-Catcher and still being unable to handle the job.

Time to go back to Obama/Biden with 6 1/2 years of job growth, cutting unemployment in half, actually caring for the people, and actually doing their job. 

Dump Trump, Vote Biden"
2020-06-26 18:51,"“I recognize that this is different than two months ago, both this our ability to respond and in the nature of those that are being infected,” Mr. Pence said. 
The nature of those being infected... what does that mean?  Latino?  Young people? And by vulnerable does he mean white rich people like him? Wow. They have figured out how to keep the virus at bay at the White House. Testing testing testing. But for everyone else, nah. 
And, can somebody tell him that the NE flattened the curve because we shut down stayed at home, something that Florida is unable to do."
2020-06-26 19:26,"Pence makes me nauseated. He is bold-faced lying. He claims to be a Christian. Perhaps he could point out where Jesus said our leaders should lie to the people.

This entire administration is so inept and ignorant  and couldn't care less  for the health and lives of the population.   At this point in time wearing masks in public must be the law of the land.

Thus, logic dictates that when Pence suggests, based on nothing, there will be no second wave, we can pretty much count on it. And it will be more deadly than the first. 

I truly hope Biden's team has a realistic plan to re-staff, re-fund and re-invigorate our public health agencies so in January 2021, when we have to begin all over again, our efforts -- and hundreds of thousands of preventable deaths -- will not have been in vain."

The First Amendment grants the freedom to peaceably assemble for this purpose: ""to petition the government for a redress of grievances."" Not to listen to a political candidate gin up his maskless base in a crowded building, not to gather in bars, and not because you're weary of staying indoors. I get it-- we're all weary. And in November, millions of my fellow Americans and I will demonstrate how weary we are of your administration's actions, Mr. Pence, including blatantly contradiciting your own recommendations to follow state governors' policies on masking and social distancing. We see through you."

People protesting that they have to wear a mask, ignore keeping 6 feet apart and almost certainly are cavalier about washing their hands often.  To elucidate what is now obvious these extremely minor inconveniences work to prevent people from infecting each other, save lives and keep the nation on a track to the day when we can begin reviving our economy without risk or fear.  To watch people carrying signs that say ""Don't tell me What to Wear"",  ""No Emergency, No Masks"" etc. and turning mask wearing into a political football rather than the public health emergency it is.  Of course the British people were led by Winston Churchill.   Our nation has become the unfit leading the uneducated to do the unthinkable"

The number of lab-confirmed cases in Minnesota has increased 37% — from 25,208 on June 1 to 34,616 as of Friday — but the numbers among people aged 6 to 19 increased 61% in the same time frame. And twenty-somethings overtook people in their 30s for the first time this week as the age group in Minnesota with the most lab-confirmed cases."

""It’s not just the lungs: The Covid-19 virus attacks like no other ‘respiratory’ infection""

The reports seemed to take doctors by surprise: The “respiratory” virus that causes Covid-19 made some patients nauseous. It left others unable to smell. In some, it caused acute kidney injury.

As the pandemic grew from an outbreak affecting thousands in Wuhan, China, to some 10 million cases and 500,000 deaths globally as of late June, the list of symptoms has also exploded. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention constantly scrambled to update its list in an effort to help clinicians identify likely cases, a crucial diagnostic aid at a time when swab tests were in short supply and typically took (and still take) days to return results. The loss of a sense of smell made the list only in late April.

“For many diseases, it can take years before we fully characterize the different ways that it affects people,” said nephrologist Dan Negoianu of Penn Medicine. “Even now, we are still very early in the process of understanding this disease.”

So I believe that Trump was correct when he said about COVID-19: ""It's going to go away.  You know it is going away.  And it will go away, and we're going to have a great victory.""  The only problem is that Trump dropped the baby a few weeks back, and he forgot to pick it back up.  Aside from refusing to lead by example by wearing a mask, the President is a captive of his own magical thinking and he has the attention span of a ferret on cocaine."
2020-06-26 18:48,"Echoing the president, the vice-president blamed the rising number of new coronavirus cases on increased testing.

If we don't test then there are no new cases of COVID-19.

As long as that mindset is in play, how in the world can anyone truly believe ANYTHING from the Trump, Pence or this administration?

""Don't tell us what to wear"", really? You are told what to wear everyday by advertising and fashion magazines.

It has taken months for Fauci to act responsible and don a mask, Birx still feels immune. Pool testing, appears to be another euphemism for we choose to do tests only from our personally approved defective kits of which there are not many. The numerous university labs in the US who are not only eminently capable of conducting and analyzing tests, but can supply more than enough to test our whole population have been shut up by Fauci and Dr. Redfield. Now with a vaccine Czar who has a $10 million investment in his vaccine of choice, we the people have no choice but to be their guinea pigs. 

Or be cajoled into taking oral polio vaccine as an interim measure till they figure it out. Duh, why did they not think of it all these years and prevent influenza the easy way. Or HIV? After all both Gallo and Fauci are the rockstars who have been studying HIV for more than a decade. So a great way to figure this out, is to give themselves the oral polio sugar cubes, walk onto a Floridian beach or better yet, a Trump rally. And still live to tell the tale. Then go ahead and initiate phase 2, All the Presidents men and the President. Phase 3, the Trump loyalists. The rest of us are patient, cautious folks. We’ll just watch you folks for entertainment till the methodology of this virus is figured out."

The painfully loud conspicuous absense was any mention at all of wearing masks that exemplifies the blindness and political basis behind all things Trump, choosing to sacrifice innocent lives to continue to stir up division between  ""us and them"" with their feckless and counter-productive actions and non-action."
2020-06-26 18:54,"It is an unbearable pain to watch and listen to this administration. 

It is a complete disconnect, due to incompetence, ignorance and, yes, stupidity. 

But the troubling development is why this pandemic is so politicized? 

Our country has currently no leadership.

Over years we have learned that a virus infection can be dealt    with if we follow ""common sense"" rules medical professionals and scientists are proposing. The current pandemic is so dangerous because the fatality rate is dangerously high - way higher than a seasonal flu, and the virus itself is not fully understood.

Why we want to inject political statements in the process of managing the outbreak? It is all about protecting human beings, care about human beings, care about our society and our civilization.

I beg the Joe Biden campaign to get prepared with a world class team (I am sure it is getting ready) to lead the way out of this carnage - and showing the world that we have the leadership, knowledge, strategy to contain this outbreak successfully!"

In their world, despite the record number of Covid-19 cases being experienced, the pandemic is now almost over and we should all party.

2020-06-26 19:43,"Are you kidding me, Mr. Pence?  ""We slowed the spread, we flattened the curve, we saved lives.""  Pence insults the intelligence of thinking Americans. He is attempting to make fools of us.  It is time to stop the lies.  We are not seeing a slowing; in fact we see an accelerating.  Flattening the curve?  Daily I observe  that red line rising, rising, rising.  We have saved people's lives?  To date, we have 124,779 deaths and 2.4 million+ cases.  No stopping, no assuaging in sight.  Mr. Pence needs to come down to earth, to join all of us who are not protected by this government.  On the contrary.  He and his boss, with no help from the Senate, are consistent and relentless in their downright negligence and lack of concern.  In my book that is called amorality."
2020-06-26 18:40,"This was all so predictable. How did I know that in many parts of America, the idea of personal sacrifice for the good of the whole just wouldn't fly? Trump country snickered and sneered at NYC, New Orleans and other hard hit cities, but now, it's in their backyard. It's in smaller cities, towns, and rural areas. But, taking their cues from a reckless and irresponsible president, they can't admit they made a mistake. The tighter they wrap themselves in the flag, the more likely it is they are depriving their brains of oxygen. Wear a mask. Take care. And vote. For God's sake, vote."
2020-06-26 18:45,"Just 10 days ago Pence and Birx were at the forefront of the scheme to blame increased testing on the alarming numbers of new Covid19 cases across the US. 
They denied the medical, scientific evidence, especially those numbers that jumped off the page: infection rates that were not flat, were not even waning, but increasing.

   Birx participated in the call in which Pence urged US Governors to push this false narrative onto 'their citizens'.
 
  How is this moment any different from all the other denials, and lies?
  
  What is the phrase for that which involves more than one person with the knowledge that their actions and or words, even their silence will cause grievously harm, even the loss of life?
  How many people have become infected since Jun 15th, how many have died?
How many more til they wind up their 'fact finding tour next week ie. to buy themselves more time?

  Charge them with criminal conspiracy, give Fauci the funds the federals authorized but have never dispersed.

2020-06-26 19:17,"Yes indeed. American ""exceptionalism"" at work. Did we think we were immune to a deadly virus? I just cannot get over the level of willful ignorance at work in the US. This is what happens when a pandemic is politicized. This virus does not care what side of the political divide on which we live."
2020-06-26 19:11,"Only 8900 cases in Florida? That's nothing, you just wait.  With the Governor we have, who I might add is a trump puppet, we will hit 16000.  Then we will have fulfilled what we have known all along.  People don't count to these republicans, only money."
2020-06-26 19:30,"Florida COVID deaths remain flat.  That should be the headline.  ""Measured cases rising"" is a mere detail of what is keeping the death count flat.  As we resume normal medical, dental and optical visits, more people are getting the health care services they need, including increased testing.  This does not directly imply any increase in COVID infections.  The answer is (d) - not enough information.

Also, let me say it is amazing to see NY/NJ people cast judgment on other areas' COVID policy after the abject, spectacular, disastrous failures of policymakers in the NY/NJ area to mitigate COVID.  Do you have no heart?  The absolute gall is remarkable, and from outside, appears to be shameless."
2020-06-26 19:52,"People have been wrangling about masks for a couple of months now, and until yesterday some nutty civilians in Florida argued in Palm Beach city council that they are the work of the devil. The CDC engaged in the almost criminal behavior of not recommending them from the start of the pandemic so that the general public does not cause a shortage for the health workers, and instead, we got a shortage of toilet paper. At the beginning, Fauci and Birx were not wearing them in their daily briefings. Now, all of a sudden, everyone is, as they became our first line of defense against contagion. So many inconsistencies, so much chaos, no clear policy, and always acting after the fact."
2020-06-26 19:58,"$27.9 million dollars will go right down the drain if we give it to the WHO. They cannot do the science needed to develop the vaccine nor do the manufacturing or distribution that is necessary. We need to put the money where it will add value, not into the WHO’s incompetent and in part corrupt bureaucracy."
2020-06-26 19:16,"This is what happens when one follows Trump’s dictates. The governors of Florida and Texas are learning that the virus is neither a hoax nor is it fading away. Unfortunately, their citizens are being forced to learn this the hard way. And where, exactly, is Trump today? Setting up a golf game? Certainly he has little to nothing to say to his friends in Florida and Texas. Yes, the takeaway here is that Trump is a hoax. And the sooner we get some leadership in the White House the faster the Trump-leaning states will control the virus. Just as New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut did."
2020-06-26 19:23,"Within the first five seconds of the news conference, I knew it was going to be more of the same:
1. The ""President"" wasn't even there* 
2. The VP wasn't wearing a mask
3. The VP lead off with the rah-rah ""America is the best"" razzle dazzle show
4. The VP answered a question about people not wearing masks at the Arizona rally by rolling out the tired and trite ""freedom of speech/expression"" garbage

At that point, I stopped watching. I'm resigned to the fact that NO ONE on the right is going to do anything to stop this raging pandemic. Honestly, I don't care if those who won't wear a mask get sick (sorry, I'm out of empathy); just don't pass it on to others who do care. 

Now, we just have to hang tough until sane leadership is sworn in in January. 

*Not complaining; relieved that we didn't have to hear about crowd sizes, how this was Obama's fault (surprised that Jimmy Carter hasn't been implicated yet), amazing responses, what ""some people"" are saying, faux vaccines, etc."
2020-06-26 18:44,"Remember, we do not need accurate information and expert guidance to get us out of this mess. We need cheerleaders. Thank you VP Pence!"
2020-06-26 20:13,"Anyone get the feeling that Pence (and mother) might believe that if the presidential polls continue to slide backwards, Trump will choose someone to replace Pence? Pence, the sniveling Christian soldier, would be a good scapegoat for Trump's woes."
2020-06-26 19:19,"I watched the task force briefing this morning. I don't know which is more stupefying: that the vice president could stand there and tell lie after lie without a tell, or that far too many republicans will believe what he said is gospel truth."
2020-06-26 19:26,"When will we accept the fact that the virus is here to stay. It's futile to try and combat it like we are, this is just a new part of life now and something that will be will us indefinitely. 

We can either accept that fact and still have an economy or we can live with Covid without one. I prefer to have a job still myself."
2020-06-26 19:30,So ignoring the threat and hoping it would just go away isn’t working.   Who would have thought?
2020-06-26 20:09,i just listened to his briefing and your report here is not representative of what he said. You are confusing the public. This is not that difficult to report on accurately.
2020-06-26 18:49,"If it walks like the flu, smells like the flu and talks like the flu then it must be the flu.

Technically covid 19 is not the flu (so please the intellectualizers, bait and switchers and medical parsers etc. save your ink) but it is getting to look more and more like it re causes, transmission, symptoms, protocol to stop it and other factors.

The states mostly republican that did not use the proper protocol for flu like viruses are paying the price now but just like the regular flu heat and humidity ie summer months help the numbers down so these states although with dramatic increases don't have numbers like NY had circa April. 

Don't get me wrong, the NY protocols after initial delays and mistakes help keep the totals from being even much worse but it looks like the summer months are also helping keep it down. Time will tell. 

It is all relative."
2020-06-26 19:17,"Why bother with listening to Pence? If Trump told him to bark at the moon, he'd be howling on camera.
Both would be wiser if they just let the ones who know epidemology and its primacy over politics to do the talking, suggesting, and directing. We know that's never happening. 
All Trump policy making is zero-sum digital: blame or praise."
2020-06-26 19:05,"So, Pence still thinks that sponsoring/ attending nearly mask-less mass rallies (He knows that some people also think ""bars, beaches, and parties"")  is okay as, to him, it’s constitutionally guaranteed under the right to free assembly. 

Maybe someone should school him on the convergence of ideas of social responsibility and public health concerns.

Also, nowhere is it written that Nature has said that we will only have to endure one Pandemic at a time; another one could be lurking down the pike.

If this administration continues to model a politicized and reckless train of thought/ behavior to the young and otherwise impressionable, we may have to say, “Will the last person standing please turn the lights off?”"
2020-06-26 20:10,"I listened to Mike Pence's ""Happy Talk"" today and was throughly disappointed.  He told us about all the ""progress"" the administration has made in attacking this virus ""under the leadership of President Trump.""

We have the most cases in the world.  We have the most deaths in the world and now we are seeing a massive number of cases spiking in some of our most populous states:  Florida, Texas, Arizona and California.

Try showing some real leadership, Mr. Pence, and wear a mask.  Same for Trump.  The failure of leadership at the national level has contributed to tens of thousands of unnecessary American deaths.  Stop the ""Happy Talk"" and demonstrate real leadership."
2020-06-26 11:04,"One wonders what Florida governor Ron DeSantis is thinking.

He's in the middle of a slow-motion, multi-vehicle wreck and he doesn't know what is happening before his eyes. I don't know if the state's constitution requires its chief executive to swear an oath ""to preserve, protect and defend"" as it does for the president of the United States. But if it does, then Governor DeSantis is criminally negligent in the performance of his duties.

He's long been one of the president's most devoted followers, a sycophantic sort of guy who seems more concerned with appearances and show than he is of substance. Like the president, the governor smiles a lot and worries about money. His state is a magnetic attraction for its beaches, hospitality industry, night life, theme parks and travel. But Florida is also, because of its tropical climate, an incubator for the spread of the Covid-19.

Republicans have a fixation with money more than common sense. Governor DeSantis appears willing to risk his citizens' and his visitors' health in service to the local and national economies, a humming, purring engine that he and his impatient president hope will guarantee Donald Trump a second term.

And Governor DeSantis is apparently ignorant of the fact that when his guests leave Florida for home, they might be super transmitters of the virus, the unwitting importers of death into their own communities. 

Not your problem, right, governor? As long as people leave their money in Florida.

That's all."
2020-06-26 19:19,"The spread of disinformation so widely propagated by hostile enemies and embraced by Republicans and the administration has reaching its true zenith with calamitous results, moving way beyond Mueller, the 2016 election, and the felling of our institutions. Knowledge and expertise is condemned, and confusion sown intentionally on what facts are real is complete. In just a few years time. I just did not think the accessories to this would be so deep and widespread and intentional on the American side. Speaking with colleagues in some of these red states is futile with regurgitation of Fox news talking points and White House politics. To paraphrase Dr. Fauci these folks are done with COVID, but COVID is not nearly done with them or us all, not even close."
2020-06-26 18:53,"There is a fatalism appearing on this planet. We have become used to the idea that no one is going to do anything about climate change, pandemics, police brutality and poverty, so we might as well party in the streets as we wait for the virus to claim us all. Those of us who are not partiers wait in our homes, hoping against the odds that wearing a mask, washing our hands, social distancing a vaccine will save us. It's like the days leading up to the fall of Rome. The barbarians are marching to the gates."
2020-06-26 18:31,"Americans need to stop all the infighting and give the Trump administration some credit for ""skillfully"" leading our country to 120,000 deaths, 20 million people out of work while inflaming racial tensions.  This was no small achievement and Donald Trump could only have done this with a very select group of  administrators and GOP Senators.  Thankfully, America has the prison space and they all need to be held accountable beyond the November elections."
2020-06-26 19:03,"If you don't want to wear a mask, OK by me.  Just don't ask us to pay for your hospital bill, which we will through higher insurance premiums, or higher taxes.

2020-06-26 18:29,"Just curious, Mr. President.....where is the economy ""roaring back?"" The Fed forecasts a 6.5% GDP drop for this calendar year. The GDP dropped by nearly 5% in the first quarter. Yesterday, it was announced that nearly1.5 million new applications were submitted last week for state unemployment. 

You declared  ""...our economy will not be shut down!"" It appears the corona virus has a greater influence in that action than do your tweets."
2020-06-26 19:02,"So many Red States felt invincible and superior to States like New York, Washington and Illinois back in April.  Then they rushed to reopen because trump and pence kept downplaying the pandemic. 

All that work, all that sacrifice was wasted.  

We should just now be coming out of the lock-down, like New York.  We should have nation wide mandatory masking and social distancing under rules put out by the Federal Government.  

Instead, we have trump who basically has thrown the country under the bus in an effort to get re-elected.  it is going to get much, much worse now, than it needed to be."
2020-06-26 19:07,"Today, a reporter asked Mike Pence why, in view of the surge in Covid-19 cases, Donald Trump was holding campaign rallies with large crowds of people?  Pence replied that people have a right to assembly even though nobody was questioning anyone's right to assemble but the wisdom of doing so at this time."
2020-06-26 18:57,"We keep hearing about the infection rate, but doesn't it seem that the NYT is downplaying the lowered death rate? Younger people testing positive is certainly not as concerning as older people testing positive. 

Younger people are far more likely to be asymptomatic. It certainly seems that the virus is becoming more contagious but less virulent as time goes on, and I wouldnt be surprised if in a few months it peters out."
2020-06-26 19:19,"The sad thing is that Trump could have viewed this pandemic an opportunity to be the white night, practically assuring his reelection, and he wouldn't even have had to actually care about peoples' health. 

Imagine him wearing a red mask with MAGA embroidered on it, causing supporters to order them by the truckload. It could have been cool to wear one, we wouldn't have seen this spike in cases, rushes to reopen the economy, the economy could get back on track safely, etc...

But instead, here we are."
2020-06-26 19:27,"CDC national guidelines for reopening (Satisfy Before Proceeding to Phased Opening):

Downward trajectory of documented cases within a 14-day period

Downward trajectory of positive tests as a percent of total tests within a 14-day period (flat or increasing volume of tests)

Downward trajectory of influenza-like illnesses (ILI) reported within a 14-day period

Downward trajectory of COVID-like syndromic cases reported within a 14-day period

Treat all patients without crisis care

Robust testing program in place for at-risk healthcare workers, including emerging antibody testing

Maybe someone should ask Trump if Florida, Arizona, Texas, North Carolina and South Carolina meet all those criteria.  (Not because we'd learn anything, but just because his contortions to create a ""good"" lie are amusing during lockdown.)

No country that has gotten a handle on this pandemic has used ""guidelines"" - they have all imposed mandates.  America is THE prime example of why that is necessary."
2020-06-26 18:30,"After waiting 2 long months, this was a complete debacle. I have no idea what the charts Dr. Birx was showing meant. Like many people, I own a large screen UHD TV. This made no difference. It was like watching someone shuffle a deck of playing cards. Even worse, VP Pence doesn't wear a mask, of course. When questioned about this, he said ""Follow state and local government guidelines"". When pressed on the issue by sending a mixed message, he brings up 1st amendment constitutional rights. Specifically, the right to to free assembly and free speech. Besides Dr. Fauci's soundbite, this was composed solely of lies, disinformation, thanking various groups, and doubletalk Casey Stengel would be proud of."
2020-06-26 19:09,"Dr. Fauci and to some extent Dr. Birx made it clear we are not out of the woods and EVERYONE needs to continue to work to avoid spreading the virus.  Dr. Birx noted young people are testing positive and although they are less vulnerable to death they are excellent transmitters.  They may not die but they may well kill. Dr. Fauci reminded viewers of the need to continue to act responsibly--socially distance and wear a mask and stay in if you can.  Young people can help save lives by acting responsibly.  

A point I don't think is coming across well enough, though, is that wearing a mask is NOT for the protection of the mask wearer. So many people--including Pence who absurdly described it as a 1st Amendment issue--resent wearing a mask, think of it as big government telling them what to do and a sign of weakness and fear.  Some think it's like telling motorcycle riders to wear a helmet or passengers in cars to buckle up.  Well, this is different.  You need to wear a mask and socially distance so you don't spread the Virus, even unintentionally.  If you are young and infected, you are likely asymptomatic but you can infect and maybe lead to the death of others--parents, grandparents, uncles, aunts, etc.  So wear a mask to show you care and tell others to wear a mask to show they care too.  It's not a sign of weakness or fear.  It's responsible.  Don't listen to tweedle dee and tweedle dum(b). Everything may be open, but the pandemic is not over.  

Thanks for your help."
2020-06-26 18:36,"It's really hard to get your head around that 8,900 daily new case number. To put that in perspective, Florida has four times as many people as we do here in Wisconsin. We have been hit fairly hard in Wisconsin by Covid-19. On our worst day, May 29, we had 733 new cases. Otherwise our worst days were in the 500s. After what seemed to be a descent down the curve, the last two days have ticked back up, to 432 and 464.

But for Florida to get 8,900 is like Wisconsin getting almost 2,500, more than three times our very worst day. So yes, I think they may finally need to close the bars there and in Texas. After being closed since March our bars here have reopened, sort of, partly due to our Republican legislative leaders being in denial. And I think this is a bad idea.

The next story from Texas will probably be the riot cops dealing with the guys trying to bust into the corner bar. I hope I'm wrong about that one."
2020-06-26 19:43,"In regard to Florida and the great states of Texas and Arizona. Governor DeSantis, Abbott, and Ducey have all been very clear that they would not sacrifice their economies or make anyone responsible for an absence of caution, so let them all stay open and experience accountability for their leadership."
2020-06-26 19:07,"What curve has been flattened, Mr. Pence? I see no evidence for that for the month of June when infections are rising on a daily basis in this country.  If your numbers are different than those reported in this newspaper, by all means share them. 

The curve has definitely flattened in Europe but I suspect Europeans would be most upset if you took credit for their drop in infections."
2020-06-26 19:19,"I distinctly remember when Dr. Birx made the announcement, many times, early in the epidemic, that young people were not much affected by the virus. She seemed to make a deliberate point of emphasizing that because, she said, the statistics indicated that most of the victims were elderly.  No doubt she was trying to calm the panicked public and wanted to prevent mass hysteria.  Of course the mass media, including the NYT, and everybody else, repeated this learned pronouncement over and over and now we have the situation today where the young and immortal are spreading the disease."
2020-06-26 19:20,"But even as cases spike around the country, Mr. Pence tried to take a victory lap, asserting, “We slowed the spread, we flattened the curve, we saved lives.” I am pretty sure they are not talking about the USA here. After all, this administration have not taken the responsibility of fighting this virus. As Trump has said in a meeting with fellow Republicans in May, "" the virus is going to go away without a vaccine.” And alas, here we are."
2020-06-26 19:23,"If you look at CDC's own data on the demographics of COVID deaths, you will see that roughly 8% of some 123,000 deaths were ages 20s, 30s, and 40s. That was roughly 10,000 DEATHS. If those 10,000 deaths had occured in isolation, the country would be stunned. But they have been buried in the catastrophic total. 

One of the reasons fewer younger adults died is that the disease was ravaging nursing homes while the rest of us were on lockdown. Now that younger adults are going out (especially in crazy states), more and more younger adults are getting infected and -- based on that 8% stat -- we can logically expect to see a HUGE increase in deaths among younger adults. 

Finally, deaths are only the most extreme outcome. Hospitalizations have occured  in about 20% of infected 20-somethings. And uncounted thousands or hundreds of thousands of younger adults have been sick at home -- with recoveries that can result in long-term impairments. 

Conclusion: the next few months are going to be even more catastrophic for the U.S."

Your freedom is not at risk by being asked to wear a mask. 
Your freedom is not at risk by being asked to limit your social activities.

This is a problem affecting essential workers, who more often than not tend to be immigrants, who, in turn, tend to be Latinos.
If this conversation was happening in 1918, the article would have found that Italians or Irish were getting infected at higher rates, hence contributing to the ""otherization"" that those groups suffered during that time.
This is a socioeconomic issue more than it is a racial issue. That fact is  alluded to, but only some times and only in some reputable publications."
2020-06-26 19:32,"When Pence says people who do whatever their states tell them to do, he's saying the Federal government isn't taking a leadership role.  Which is possibly for the best with this rudderless, disorganized administration in charge."
2020-06-26 19:51,"I suggest that America start putting in place the procedures for dissolution of the union.   Clearly, combined with the overwhelmingly deep and growing divisions within the country, all of this has created an untenable situation in which any solutions to problems national in nature, regardless of who is in power, will be all but impossible to solve.

It is time to cut the umbilical cord with those who wish to live in the past, it's over."
2020-06-26 19:32,"If we would only heed the President’s* guidance and slow down or stop testing the numbers, statistics, would decrease. 
Yessiree. Good guidance. 
Yet given Trump’s shoddy snd lacking any substantive leadership attributes people still look to him as someone who should be listened to. Or feared in the case of the weak-kneed GOP governors. 
When I do venture out for needed shopping it almost appears to many we are not in a resurgence of the virus and have a lingering pandemic-no masks or distancing. 
The virus will prevail over many who will lose their lives and the virus will not “just go away” or be no worse than the flu. 

Now, in the present, we have two virus strains to eradicate-covid-19 and Covfefe-45."
2020-06-26 20:32,"""Officials are discussing a possible shift to ‘pool testing,’ Fauci says.""

The problem with pooling samples is the potential false negative rate. Unless you have an extremely sensitive test with close to zero false negatives, diluting a positive sample with some number of negatives (In the case made in the piece of <30% positive rate) can make you miss the positive sample for lack of test sensitivity.

There have been numerous reports about false negative cases, with many possible causes including swab errors, sample transport issues, timing of sampling etc, not to mention the variation in actual tests kits being used.

Just multiply those issues with the dilution factor introduced with sample pooling.

You are essentially fulfilling Trump's wish of decreased testing to  make the numbers look better."
2020-06-26 20:35,"Ron De Santis was lucky that nursing homes and assisted living facilities in Florida didn’t wait for his lockdown decision in late April and executed it right away voluntarily in mid March .
Older Floridians were spared a death sentence by the alertness of people truly responsible , this is the reason Florida’s fatalities are still so low .
Now with accelerated reopening of businesses many younger people are getting infected and becoming infectious.
Testing is still lacking and there are agricultural towns such as Immokalee in the rich Collier County , where Doctors Without Borders ( an French charity group)  were called in to help in a significant Covid outbreak, since local Health Department couldn’t  cope with it . The Sun State isn’t in a good shape !"
2020-06-26 20:55,"Mr. Pence, in 2020 there are many ways to exercise free speech in a campaign season, although admittedly innovation is not this administration’s strong suit.  Trump’s rallies are utterly indefensible and irresponsible given the rapid spread of Covid-19. Unless all his attendees agree to subsequently board buses post-rally and immediately quarantine together for two weeks at a military base where they will be monitored 24/7 until cleared or moved to a separate facility if tested positive.  The Trump campaign will need to cover all such costs and repay taxpayers for the use of our bases.

I’m in the older and vulnerable group but I know its natural for young adults, perhaps getting ready to return to work or college after being at home, to yearn for more freedom, to want to meet people, date, maybe have a few drinks, etc. 

How do they meet people? How do they date? How do they hang out with friends...and  socialize without 
endangering their professors and parents and grandparents...not to emotion complete strangers ? 

Alcohol and hanging out in bars isn’t a great mix for maintaining social distancing requirements. But what about backyard gatherings, everyone at a distance? We’ve had street concerts in our area where young adults, those in their teens, 20s and early 
30s, sat at a safe distance, listened to music, and got to know each other.  Many were marked. But even those who weren’t were already much safer because they were in open air and at a decent distance from others"

On several Friday nights during the past 3.5 years, whenever the news is dreary, Trump will fire somebody or announce a fresh hell to be visited somewhere. Maybe the ""Friday news bombshell"" happened this week on a Thursday, because yesterday we found out that the Repubs are planning (again) to erase the Affordable Care Act. 

This new news seems especially dreary today, what with the spikes in virus cases, so they added to our troubles by taking away health insurance from our most vulnerable. It makes sense in a perverted way.

I think one of the small things to look forward to in a Democratic administration will be the fact that we don't have to worry about what Fridays will bring."

I just heard that even in the Northeast only 65% of people wear a mask, and that is the highest in the nation. Caring about the welfare of others has disappeared. Today at Target, which requires that everyone wear a mask (per a mandatory rule from the state of NC), three women walked in without masks. When an employee told them they needed masks, all hell  broke loose. He finally let them enter. He told me that there was nothing he could do to stop obnoxious idiots (his words). I’m 60, so I remember a very different country. Yes, there were hateful, selfish, crazy conspiratorial people., but a lot of them lived under their rocks.

What is more important, saving American lives or re-electing Trump. I know Trump's answer! It is always about him. Always and forever. 121,000 Americans die? Pfft. Nothing compared to the importance of moving Trump along to become dictator.

Ten minutes later, before the service began, only 3 of us out of 50 were still wearing our masks! The ignorance and denial are just breathtaking. 

I may be in denial about our country. When I see the least educated among us carrying assault rifles at public  gatherings it makes my head hurt. They smirk and strut, completely unaware of how utterly stupid they look and how ridiculous it is to carry assault rifles and wear camouflage inside city limits.

Eventually even Trump's base will have to wake up to the reality that their hero is a corrupt, narcissistic peddler of toxic snake oil, but by then it will be too late.

It is worth noting that NY-ers are impatient but not dumb. What we see in the red states is just dumb and it’s in the numbers; all starting with the president and followed by the enabling governors who are willfully blind at a detriment to local economies.

Oh that's right. Trump states that if you don't test, the corona virus will just go away.  

Tell that to my friend whose father suffered and just died from to Covid-19.

Besides, President Trump is far more concerned about the statues of dead confederates than the 125,000 American citizens who have died over the past four months.

But what about the loud silence of congressional republicans...while the people they swore to protect are being 'burned' and forgotten?

Should there not be a vaccine in the not too distant future (but its the future when we'll see one, and not soon) are those living under Repubs, and acting belligerently to the facts - do these people really want to live in a constant state of start and stop, start and stop...one step kinda forward, three backwards? 

That's not a sane, or a healthy approach, nor is it at all  healthy for the economy! 

If we take the various behavioral prescriptions and advice to heart now, and make the sacrifices now, make adjustments now...we can better manage the nuances of the uncertain future. But uncertain it will be and remain...and only worsen in its chaos, with all these mixed up quick-start opening approaches. 

None of which do anything for us citizens, and are only aimed to serve the very short-sighted campaign agenda of Trump! Locally, voters will sack their dopey mistake making officials, even if they support Trump! Whats that expression about all politics being local...? Duh!

Brix did her usual defense of the federal covid group, pretending that she and CDC members are flooding hot spot states, taking credit for any flattening and testing hat is being done entirely by the governors. She is far more dangerous making these claims than is Mike Pence, and I cannot see what purpose her endless statistics are for except excusing herself and the Pence group for ineffectuality. Fauci was a bit better, and news reports are saying he was the clear voice of concern. On the other hand, he was a mealymouthed as usual, arguing that the Trump team was actually caught off guard by the changing nature of the pandemic (seriously).

For starters, it's NOT an oxygen mask put over the mouth while the patient is comfortably lying down and reading magazines. Ventilation for Covid-19 is a painful intubation that goes down your throat and stays there until you live or you die.
It is done under anesthesia for 2 to 3 weeks without moving, often upside down, with a tube inserted from the mouth up to the trachea and allows you to breathe to the rhythm of the lung machine. The patient can't talk or eat, or do anything naturally - the machine keeps you alive.
The discomfort and pain they feel from this means medical experts have to administer sedatives and painkillers to ensure tube tolerance for as long as the machine is needed. It's like being in an artificial coma."

With the young not being so badly affected by the virus (it's a very small percentage who end up in hospital) I'm beginning to think, yes, let them go out and about, socialising in big groups, no masks etc.  If herd immunity is what we, as a population, need, together with a vaccine, then let these young people (so adverse to the restrictions) become our 'herd' guinea pigs. Bars, restaurants, beaches, pool parties, have at it.
The older, more vulnerable population will need to isolate for longer, be more careful when venturing out, keep clear of this demographic, and businesses won't get the 'grey' money, but we might get on top of this crisis quicker."

So I’ll say what he could not: The spread of this virus is due to this administration’s failure of leadership from Trump on down and to all those selfish people who are not social distancing or wearing masks in public.

The Trump administration and its congressional enablers do not value human life as evidenced by their efforts to overturn the Affordable Care Act in the midst of this pandemic.  They care only about packing the federal courts with unqualified lifetime appointees and using their remaining time in office to enrich themselves and their cronies.  Anyone who fails to vote BLUE this November is not a patriot.  We need to unite and stop the madness now.
2020-06-26 21:06,The administration’s negligence in testing even extends to pressuring FEMA to use an unvetted contractor with criminal connections to provide very specific shaped test tubes.  They were delivered useless soda bottles instead!
2020-06-26 21:13,"It is telling Pence is in front of the cameras and not Trump, when Covid cases increase in several GOP states."
2020-06-26 21:26,"Pence only speaks to an audience of one, Donald Trump. Every other person in the country is of secondary concern to him. (Pence’s sycophancy is one of the most absurd aspects of this absurd presidency.) Yes, Fauci spoke to the American people today, but all of his “strong suggestions,” wisdom, and advice fall on too many deaf ears. Too many Americans have given up caring about the virus to head his warnings. I know people, educated people, who have said the problem of the virus is “overblown” by liberals. So this week, we have learned where this kind of thinking has led us."
2020-06-26 21:24,"Oh, was there a coronavirus task force news conference today? I must have missed it."
2020-06-26 21:01,"So the markets drop over 6% in the past 48 hours and right on cue... Pence appears at the podium to give the good news that we're winning!

I'm really avoiding thinking about the abyss we're looking into as a nation.  

I travel extensively and work with many people internationally.  My friends and colleagues pitty me for living in America.  It's disgusting."
2020-06-26 21:11,"Mr. Pence is whistling a happy tune as he puts a happy face on the exploding disaster that is the GOP centerpiece of their Coronavirus response. Formulating policy inside a Fox News echo chamber that scorns reputable science in  petulant opposition to a political foe is not governance, but childishness. The fact that politicians are actors performing for an angry, impatient audience eager to show up their enemies is the source of such irresponsible behavior. The price is the health and welfare of the audience."
2020-06-26 21:09,"Unfortunately this ultimately falls on each and every one of us. 
  If you run a company, step up. If  you control access to a building, step up.If your involved in company policy, step up. If you have sway in your local community, definitely step up.
 Sadly, this is where we are at in today's America.
      It is up to us.
Our government isn't leading.
  We have to do it ourselves. It is literally a matter of life and death."
2020-06-26 21:24,"Pence is the head of the pandemic response. 

For two months he has been AWOL, gone, not to be seen.
Then yesterday, at a special luncheon (not 'lunch') for Republicans he gave forth his Plan.

""Accentuate the positive,"" he told them, wink, wink.

That's because he doesn't want anyone mentioning the FACT that in his 2 month absence, the number of dead, the number of persons who died of Coronavirus, came to 69,064, just about the same number that died in Vietnam over a twenty year span.

# of dead on April 27: 56,256.

# of dead June 26: 125,320.

The numerical difference of ""When Pence/Trump did nothing""?

69,064.

But the Republican Plan is to ""accentuate the positive"".
That and cutting back the testing is ALL they have planned.

I give them all a ""Vote of No Confidence""."
2020-06-26 21:07,"Does the entire Republican party really want to go down with Trump? When will Republican governors and congresspersons wake up and challenge his dangerous rhetoric? COVID-19 should have never become a political football but Trump, in his obsession to smother facts and continue to attempt to delude people that this pandemic is under control, will take his party down with him."

2020-06-26 21:49,"So, all of those privatization fans out there who want to starve the USPS out of existence should know that we're waiting on a package full of PPE to reopen our business according to County guidelines that's coming by UPS and that UPS can't deliver it to us. I've waited in long lines 3 days in a row for a package that's been sitting on a truck in their lot for over a week and they say there are still 15 trucks ahead of us to unload and they don't know if they can process and hand over to us before the end of the month. Ben Franklin was right -- the mail is a critical national service tied to national security. ""Sorry"" isn't good enough at a time like this."
2020-06-26 21:51,"I've been hearing ""we're all in this together"" for about 3 months now. I don't think I want to be in this together with political leaders who think praising their own performance and denying what is plainly visible to the rest us is their chief strategy."
2020-06-26 21:51,"At the risk of sounding like I agree with anything Trump says — I absolutely do not — I’m beginning to have doubts about how meaningful Covid testing data is on a national scale. The parameters of testing are so haphazard that I fear comparing positive test rates is like comparing apples with oranges. The only data I trust fully is the rise or fall of hospitalizations. 

For example, in my county you can get tested through county health services only if if you are symptomatic and suspect you have Covid-19. You need to fill out a form and get it approved. A neighboring county offered drive-through testing sites, open to anyone, for free, whether symptomatic or not. That neighboring county should have a higher rate of negative tests than my county, based on the pool tested, no? They should also find more active cases. A week ago I had virus symptoms and used the screening website created by my health care provider, to see whether I qualified for a Covid-19 test. The screener program said I did not. I am over age 60 and have a history of asthma, and I had a high fever and other symptoms. I contacted my primary care physician directly and was referred for a test. In other words, I went around the system to get tested. But how many symptomatic people who get that “you do not qualify“ result just accept it and don’t get tested?"
2020-06-26 21:56,"The fact that Republicans try to tamp down the numbers of COVID infections and deaths is in itself proof that they have done a thoroughly incompetent job of managing the effects of the pandemic. If they truly believed they were doing a competent job, and/or were being handcuffed by many years of poor decisions by previous administrations, they could justify their actions as reasonable, most people would give them the benefit of the doubt, and the true infection and mortality numbers for every community on US soil would be known, and not questioned. When, on the other hand, we have a government populated by senior leadership that has never been in government before, led by a reality TV star who believes perception is reality, we get what we now have: coronavirus statistics like those in Florida, which are highly suspect."
2020-06-26 20:50,"Pence's ""performance"" today was constructed for one person and one person only, his boss.

2020-06-26 21:01,"At the conclusion of World War II, the Nuremberg Trials were conducted for the following crimes committed by the Nazis; crimes against peace, war crimes, crimes against humanity, and conspiracy to commit any of the foregoing crimes.

From the first news coming out of China regarding Covid-19, President Donald J. Trump has acted solely for the benefit of himself and his reelection. Instead of leadership and concern for every American, Trump has had only scorn, lies, hatred and ridicule. Trump has used the immense power and prestige of his office as President of he United States of America, the richest, most advanced nation in world history, not to preserve protect and defend his fellow Americans, but to divide, damage and destroy because it suits him to do so.

124,000 Americans have died from Covid-19 inside of six months time. By November that figure could conservatively reach 500,000 thanks to Donald Trump, Vice President Pence and those who have actively spread the Trump's lies and carried out his wishes. 

Donald  J. Trump has committed  Crimes against humanity and Conspiracy and we deserve to see him have his day in court. Finnally."

2020-06-26 22:05,"You degraded the standing of your paper when you actually bothered to write anything Pence said, especially his idiotic claims of Freedom, which really means reckless endangerment.

It must be some Republican back room bean counter idea to make more money."
2020-06-26 22:07,What a waste of airtime on Pence! We are sooo great we did so much for you.  Pat us on the back. His speaking time should have been handed over to Dr. Fauci. Then just like his daddy says masks shouldn’t be mandatory. What a wimp. No backbone here. Voter talk for the uneducated.

It's like listening to my cat.  I think she tells me when she's hungry, but beyond that sonorous meow it's all a mystery to me.  There is no language to connect us."
2020-06-26 21:55,"Pence praises the Trump crime family’s response to the coronavirus, then asserts that it’s “good news” that younger people are contracting the virus? What planet has he been living on? What he lacks in malignant narcissism he makes up for in abject ignorance. You could not conjure a more incompetent cohort of thoughtless, heartless fools if you scoured every casting agency in America. What a giant — and deadly — disappointment this administration has been, in every conceivable way. Now they’ve killed nearly 125,000 Americans. It’s monstrous. Absolutely monstrous."

He has educated us brilliantly but when it comes down to being effective he is a failure."
2020-06-26 21:47,Unbelievable that Mike Pence defends the administration’s response to the virus and Trump’s rallies. It’s as indefensible as saying “Kung Flu” is not racist... They are immoral.

That's a new innovation in cross-ventilation."""
2020-06-26 21:29,"Yes Pence is visiting Texas and bringing Birx with him apparently.  What you did not report was the original reason for his visit was to speak at a Dallas megachurch on Sunday.  This event has not been cancelled, at least not at this point in time.

At some point we have to protect ourselves from the lies and the lying liars who tell them, or free speech won't matter anymore."
2020-06-26 21:44,"The goal was to flatten the growth curve of the virus so our health system can handle it. The growth curve as depicted in the NYT has been flattened. As my Governor Newsom has said California is now experiencing the downside of flattening the curve ie it lasts longer. He also says that we need to be vigilant (ie test) this is what we are doing. If spikes occur act quickly to address the problem. In the mean time practice social distancing, hand washing,masks etc. This last part is really something Newsom, Cuomo,Trump,Pence etc can practically only recommend. Imagine if they tried to impose and enforce large penalties for not maintaining a six foot perimeter or not wearing a mask. Court cases would extend into the millennium. Some things the government (at least democratic governments) can’t force people to do. It’s time for the public to do their job not throw stones at the politicians."
2020-06-26 22:01,"Florida announced face masks mandatory. Fines of $50 first offence, $100 second and $500 third. But just hours earlier Pence announced that it was a constitutional right not to wear a mask. Fredom and all that. Does anyone have a clue?"

If one person loses their life from the spread due to the rallies, well then........sickening, just sickening."
2020-06-26 21:29,"Pence’s victory lap? What a stunning lack of shame on his part for telling such obvious And demonstrable lies. It’s like Trump once said: Americans, what you’re seeing and hearing (from this administration) is not the truth."

2020-06-26 21:49,"I watched a few minutes of the presentations of Anthony Fauci and Vice President Mike Pence.

I've been reading the book, ""the Room where it Happened"" by John Bolton, so have learned something about the toxic dynamics in the White House.

Thus Pence must be loyal to Trump, so of course he refused to wear a mask, like Fauci and the others.

But the NY Times has been so unrelenting in its criticism of Trump that it's credibility is beginning to suffer, at least with me.

Trump does not represent all Republicans.  He represents those Republicans who have become cynical and have given up on negotiation and compromise and want to simply force the other side to admit defeat.

Yes, Trump will be defeated in November.  But what kind of country will we have when he leaves the White House?

The NY Times seems to argue for the rights of minorities.  But who decides which of the minorities are oppressed?

Are fundamentalist Christians a minority?  If so, do they have a right to practice their religion?  That would include Billy and Franklin Graham holding crusades to convince people to come to Christ, even though they believe homosexuality is a ""sin.""

And isn't the tearing down of a statue of Junipero Serra a ""hate crime"" directed at Catholics?  After all, Serra was a priest who wanted to save the souls of the natives in California's missions.

The NY Times seems to be encouraging the abuse of freedoms from radicals on the left.

Our country can go off the rails in either direction."
2020-06-26 21:55,"Pence willfully ignores reality, content to parrot favorable propaganda, which will cost American lives. He’s as complicit and dangerous as Trump — two empty suits more concerned with their own re-election than fighting a surging, catastrophic pandemic. This is not leadership.

Unfit for office!"
2020-06-26 21:28,"Every medical professional I've been in contact with is far more alarmed and concerned than most of the politicians and a lot of the public seem to be. And this is in relatively blue and liberal California. I can only imagine how bad it must be in red states.

The virus is relentless. We cannot afford to be careless, cavalier or willfully ignorant. Yet far too many people are. Including those with significant power. 

It's going to get a lot worse before it gets better."
2020-06-26 21:38,"Pence.  I watched him as he defended Trump spreading the virus (and more horrible illness and death) via his indoor campaign rallies.  We have the right to free speech under the Constitution, said he, plus, peaceful and lawful assembly.  And the president believes in the political system.

Unlike like the shouting, screaming, wild-eyed Trump, Pence barely moves a muscle or betrays an emotion as he betrays the American people and quietly contributes to ever more deaths."
2020-06-26 22:09,"There's an odd, unpleasant vibe to the behaviour of the UK's 'School's Out' crowds. An unusually high number of arrests, reports of fighting, assaults, stabbings, rapes and general lawlessness. Residents of the seaside towns that were invaded by pretty, er, 'exuberant' mobs reported the experience as 'nasty' and 'scary'.

4th July is independence day for bars and pubs across the whole UK. They've all been closed since March. There's a lot of real concern amongst citizens that there'll be utter mayhem then - Brits not being known for their sobriety and temperance at the best of times. To my astonishment, all four of my children have declared they'll be staying home on the 4th. They must know something.."

2020-06-26 21:37,"To anyone who's been paying attention, it's obvious that the President has... issues. It isn't just selfishness or a drive to get a second term. The guy has serious emotional instability--- have we ever had a president who NEEDS constant adoring crowds to breathlessly listen as he, Castro-like, rants for hours at a time?

But V-P Pence? He's a worse sort. He recognizes what's happening, but he doesn't just go along, sit in the corner like a good lapdog, and bide his time. 
No. 
He actually comes out and says even more dangerous things, like today's  ""tremendous progress"" craziness. How many of the faithful will believe that and fight social distancing and mask-wearing? 

""...a Christian, a conservative, and a Republican, in that order."" That's Pence describing himself. God protect us all--- from him and his boss."
2020-06-26 21:31,"Does Pence realize he puts human life at risk by downplaying the pandemic urgency with his outright lies?  He is proving beyond doubt that he's just as bad as Trump, if not worse, by hiding behind his evangelical — not medically protective — mask.  How does he reconcile his lies with his faith?"

This is going to spread just like it did last time. 

We have a president who is so self-important and knows darn well those masks are a symbol of his failure to act on early information he got, so he doesn't want to see masks. He sees them as an attack on his competence. Combine that with a Vice President who is nothing more than an impotent, born-again lapdog who jumps however high Trump wants him to. And we have got a problem that will be our worst nightmare in 6 months, the day after Christmas, when none of us have jobs, our savings is gone, businesses have permanently closed, and we have no help from anyone. 

Whether it's 2021 or 2025, I want to be there when Trump/Pence swear in the new president and they are handcuffed and taken into custody immediately afterwards. There will be dancing in the streets to know the women and men of this administration are finally in federal prison where they belong."

Houston’s ICU bed availability is about to be surpassed...we just went on a suggested (only suggested, since Abbott won’t mandate it) stay-home order again...the state is on fire, and it’s not just from thirsty Texans, it’s from unforgivable and appalling Republican incompetence from Trump on down to his acolytes, including Abbott. These people have cost so many American lives—yet Abbott STILL doesn’t want to close us down, despite hopelessly bungling it last time."

2020-06-26 21:36,"Immediately after Mr. Biden is inaugurated as President in 2021, the US should lay the groundwork for a series of Nuremburg-style trials of all public officials who can plausibly be shown to have failed in their official capacities to have protected the public's health during the US's Trump 2020 Corona Virus Epidemic (referred to in the global sense as the Coronavirus Pandemic).  

Many federal and state officials have been responsible for hundreds, even thousands, of deaths that can be linked to their lying, delaying, malfeasance, neglect, inaction, political cowardice, and other failures.   

Trump is surely the most prominent name in this rogues gallery, but many others whose names ring in our ears also contributed in major ways to the catastrophe: Pence, Abbott, Cuomo, DeSantis, di Blasio, Ducey, to name just a few.    

Will justice prevail?  Or will these miscreants make yet another mockery of US justice?"
2020-06-26 21:36,"Well, thank you Mr. Pence for giving us the ""good news"" that we've slowed the spread and flattened the curve.  Guess that means that you guys in the WH haven't had any more staffers test positive."

2020-06-26 21:30,"After watching Pence’s performance today, I cannot agree more with what General Kelly said, ""I think we need to look harder at who we elect.”. Pence’s inane comments and explanations were unworthy of the office he occupies. For him to use the freedoms of speech and assembly to justify holding super spreader events were tantamount to falsely yelling fire in a crowded theatre."
2020-06-26 21:48,"Oh, I misunderstood Pence's answer to the reporter's question.  I thought he responded that it was okay for he and Trump to lie and say how the virus is under control and things are improving even if it's obviously is not true, because of the right of free speech.  Now here in the comments I read their mega rallies spreading the virus are fine because of free speech.    Either way it's awful.  We need new smart scientifically savvy leaders in the White House."
2020-06-26 21:49,"At the starting point when there were very few cases in your country and the virus could have been contained, Trump declared the virus a non-event, with people’s concerns being driven by a media/Democrat hoax. Comments flooded into the NYT declaring the flu was worse than the virus, followed by ‘the virus is no worse than the flu’ as case numbers rose.

Containment measures were then introduced although gun shops were declared an essential service.

This was followed by comments complaining about the unfairness of restrictions when it was just the elderly and unwell who were at risk.  Better to isolate them and let the rest of you do what you want.  It seems it was ok to sacrifice a generation.

Comments then focused on the view that the damage to the economy was significantly more serious than the threat of the virus, ignoring the fact that the economy would suffer anyway if everyone got sick and died.

Then came the demands to lift restrictions, after all US citizens have a right to freedom (read ‘do what they want’).  

About this time, commenters started pointing out that Democrat led states had more cases, like there was simple cause and effect.

As case numbers soared, commenters said only dictator states could implement the ‘draconian’ measures needed to contain the virus, followed closely by ‘there was nothing anyone could have done’, then the completely incorrect ‘no one has done a better job’.

The US handles prosperity well, but has no adequate response to crisis."

Perhaps we could get it sooner via the 25th Amendment rather than after January 20 with a new Biden Administration, and save tens of thousands of lives.

As soon as the malignant Trump Administration is assigned to the dust bin of history, we need a 90 day strict lockdown across the country with income supports.  After that, a robust testing and tracing program until there's a vaccine.

Anyone have a better idea?"
2020-06-26 22:02,"A friend said, ""please come over Saturday for a social-distancing soiree."" I politely declined the invitation. The follow up stated, ""give me some dates for availability!""

See you online."

While the ticker under him was mentioning the new records of infections and the diminishing number of hospital beds in Houston. Where is the leadership?"
2020-06-26 22:09,"To those who believe that wearing a mask is an impingement to their freedom, what about wearing a seat belt?  Is that an impingement to their freedom too?"
2020-06-26 22:10,"Vice President Pence, you should also remember that with rights come responsibilities.

The President had a responsibility to ask, just because I can hold a rally, should I hold a rally? 

Rights come with responsibilities."
2020-06-26 22:23,"As I watched VP  Pence toss bushels of congratulatory sprinkles upon Trump and the administration for their response to this pandemic, I could not stop laughing because the picture Pence painted was all about THEM.

The individuals who helped slow the spread, helped flatten the curve and helped save lives were the front-line medical professionals who worked countless hours with very little sleep while putting their own lives at risk in order to save others.

The other individuals who helped achieve some measures of success against this virus are the governors of various states who mandated shelter in place orders, the wearing of face masks and keeping a social distance AND every American who complied with those mandates.

A lot of people suffered greatly, personally and financially, because of the sacrifices they made to remain home, without the possibility of a job to return to or being cut off from a loved one who became ill from the virus and/or passed away.

So before Pence does another ""victory lap"" around the White House grounds, patting himself, Trump and their administration on the back for a job well done, it was the every day American who helped accomplished these slow down, flattened curve, live saving measures."
2020-06-26 22:17,"So, at the same press conference where medical experts were reporting a surge in covid-19 cases, Pence says Trumps crowded rallies are OK because an election is coming up! In other words Trumps re-election is more important than lives! Total stupidity and insanity.Dumb and dumber."

2020-06-26 22:22,"Individual ""societal responsibility"" is completely anathema for Republicans and the trump. Individual responsibility for them means leveraging good fortune to the extreme at the peril and harm to everyone else - increasing the spread of the consequences of their irresponsible and reckless decisions to others. Society, the planet and it's environment are resources for them to exploit to the max for ungodly wealth hoards regardless of the deaths, damage and sacrifices imposed on the rest of us.

Pence's free speech rights over the common good while asking us to pray highlight the moral swamp he is standing on. If the church is burning down around you, you'd better stop praying and get out regardless of your rights to practice your religion!

Does European travel ban from America include travelers on Air Force One? Go figure, all Americans are now being lumped into the same boat as trump and Russia and all those not wearing masks but wearing red caps - how humiliating."
2020-06-26 22:27,"""Mr. Pence described the revelation that half of new cases are affecting Americans under 35 as “good news” because younger people are less likely to fall seriously ill.""

In other news, it was described as ""good news"" that I crashed my car, but it didn't burn, so it can be repaired. And the dog died, but at least he didn't crawl under the porch first and the decay stinking up the whole house. And the washing machine leaked, but it's in the basement so no floors were ruined. A tree fell on the roof, but it only made a small hole, only a couple rooms, and we have plenty of blue tarp to nail over the hole. Grandpa had cancer, but the doctors were able to amputate his leg so he's going to live. Things are really looking up, really going great!"
2020-06-26 22:31,Pence forgot to end his speech with 'and everyone lived happily ever after.'
2020-06-26 22:16,First briefing in two months! That is not leadership in a crisis.
2020-06-26 22:19,"Anyone even remotely familiar with the Battle of Britain early in WWII will know how courageous the people of London were.  They withstood privation, terrible bombings by the Nazis, the need to race to the Underground for safety, the loss of loved ones and home etc.  Flash forward to the US during the worst Pandemic in 100 years and what do we see? People protesting that they have to wear a mask, ignore keeping 6 feet apart and almost certainly are cavalier about washing their hands often.  To elucidate what is now obvious these extremely minor inconveniences work to prevent people from infecting each other, save lives and keep the nation on a track to the day when we can begin reviving our economy without risk or fear.  To watch people carrying signs that say ""Don't tell me What to Wear"",  ""No Emergency, No Masks"" etc. and turning mask wearing into a political football rather than the public health emergency it is.  Of course the British people were led by Winston Churchill.   Our nation has become the unfit leading the uneducated to do the unthinkable"
2020-06-26 22:22,Today’s press conference was another clown show with Pence attempting to gaslight us into believing the pandemic is over while the others were doing the opposite. Can these briefings just have the medical professionals and not the butler spouting more lies for his master?
2020-06-26 22:14,Remember how we were complaining that we could not prepare against covid19 because China was hiding info?   What is our excuse now?
2020-06-26 22:17,Is it too much to ask that people wear masks and do not gather at crowded parties for a few months?
2020-06-26 22:24,"We all knew this was going to happen.  Why is anyone surprised?  The health and welfare of this nation was undermined by the Trump administration for profits, the economy, and the election.  As a result, the economy will continue to suffer and more people will needlessly die.  The United States of America is now grouped with Russia and Brazil by the EU as pariahs."
2020-06-26 22:29,"So, the EU is going to embargo travelers from the U.S., but permit travelers from China. Oh, man, that is hilarious. I can't wait to see Trump's face when that ""gotcha"" question comes up at a briefing. Assuming he has any more briefings after that provable disaster from Pence this morning."
2020-06-26 22:17,"I’m just wondering...

If the Trump Administration ever succeeds in getting rid of the ACA, what happens to all those people with lingering health problems from COVID-19 infections? I’m assuming insurance companies will consider a past COVID infection as a pre-existing condition."
2020-06-26 18:28,"Why exactly are they closing? Didn't the Lt Gov of Texas said that his constituents should take the risk and even sacrifice their lives for the future of the economy?
He should take of his mask and mingle with like minded and sacrifice his life for the economy. Its a free country isn't it?
My servant is uneducated, can't read or write yet he does not enter the premise if the windows are open and I provide him with mask and glove and permission to shower before he goes home."
2020-06-26 17:11,Meeting in large groups is okay if you’re protesting Trump and pulling down statues. Our nation has become defaced rubble thanks to pandering Democrats.
2020-06-26 23:06,"In Ellicott City, Md a highly  educated and quite diverse town  I see masks on most not all in open spaces , most folks are taking this seriously.  That said, This Covid 19 is going to be with us for a while.  Lets put our masks on and then ask a bigger question. How can we mitigate an infection?  

I'm no expert, but I would ,start eating better and step up my game with regard to my health.  If I had any inflammatory issues, excess body fat, diabetes, high blood pressure and other lifestyle disorders  I would be quite nervous.  In fact, I might be scared to death to walk outside.   

If there is any better time to eat more plant based foods and less red meat, now is the time.  Get your health in order and buckle up because this will be a bumpy ride."
2020-06-26 22:37,"Pence: ""We have saved lives and flattened the curve."" Americans have proven their stupidity in electing Trump and Pence. Must both of them continue to rub that in?"
2020-06-26 22:50,Pence ...Good news! Young democratic tiktokkers are going to suffer a major outbreak?!
2020-06-26 22:53,"Hard to believe how many clueless, servile and stupid people decide about our lives, starting with Vice President Mike Pence trying to fool people that everything is OK."

2020-06-26 22:45,"I'm very sorry to say but Dr Fauci has lost all credibility in my view.  First..he said masks wouldn't' help that was 3 months ago... and then ignoring Trump madness and.... trumpeting possible treatments (prematurely) sitting in Oval Office glancing at Trump for approval. 
Sorry Anthony... that's what Trump calls you... you have been coopted as is the Trump manner.
You have lost credibility. Now we understand how you've survived 6 administrations. you know which way the wind blows and how to bend. Sad that everyone is corrupted by this guy Trump."

Drs Fauci and Birx are letting us down when they do not explicitly call this hypocrisy out.

Shame on you, Pence."
2020-06-26 22:41,"Trump flames conflict between his lame supporters and everyone else about wearing masks thereby subjecting everyone to serious risks, tries to take away affordable health care act through the Supreme Court and strip vulnerable people of health insurance at the exact wrong time, conducts rallies counter to every healthcare professionals advice.....does anyone believe this guy has any interest in American welfare? On the contrary, I think he is a Russian agent trying to destroy this country....in broad daylight. Are there enough stupid people in this country to allow this to continue? My head hurts just thinking about it!"
2020-06-26 22:55,"It's really dumb how mask wearing has become a partisan wedge because the simple act of covering up the mouth and nose area seems to be very effective in stopping COVID-19.

I wish we would look to Taiwan and learn from them. The Taiwanese government handed out masks to everyone ASAP. And among non-African, non-tropical countries plus the Vatican, Taiwan has the lowest COVID deaths at 0.3 per million. For comparison, the UK is fourth deadliest at 640 per million, after Belgium at 840. The US is currently ninth at 385.

2020-06-26 22:38,Pence and Trump live in a parallel universe in which everything is rosy.  Unfortunately it is also delusional.
2020-06-26 22:55,I am now totally convinced Pence is a robot - made in China.
2020-06-26 22:42,"Humbly, our Constitution does Not support anything that may lead to death."
2020-06-26 22:59,"I simply cannot wrap my head around how anyone still supports this administration except for cult or greed.  In the case of cult it is incredible ignorance that transcends education.  In the case of greed it is simply those that perhaps own businesses and care nothing about their country or anyone else so long as taxes keep going down and courts are stacked such that any litigation they may face will be ruled in their favor.

My sweet Southern wife was watching the Pence debacle this afternoon and turned it off in disgust shortly after the reporter asked Pence about Trumps rallies and distancing.

This situation is well beyond political stripe now (or should be) with the most incompetent, lying and corrupt administration this country has ever seen."
2020-06-26 22:57,I think Greg Abbott is possibly in cahoots with other states on some kind of attrition/genocide pact.    Trump is at the top of the heap.   I can't come to any other logical conclusion.
2020-06-26 23:01,"The one thing worse than someone negligently causing a senseless death is someone negligently causing a senseless death and then lying about whether or not it happened at all.  That negates the person's life in its entirety.

Mike Pence, who is leading a failure of a pandemic response because of his adulation to his Dear Leader, today said the number of U.S. deaths yesterday and the day before had been under 300.  They were closer to 700.  Instead he offers ""thoughts and prayers"" the same thing he and all the rest of his criminal party offer when an active shooter with an NRA sponsored rifle mows down a crowd.

Leslie Nielsen without the entertaining and funny part. But still a joke.  We can do our own gallows humor, Mike, you worry about the hundred thousand you didn't care about dying."
2020-06-26 22:52,"Pence's role as Trump's lap dog has taken a dangerous turn when he sanctimoniously refers to the rights enshrined in our Constitution as justification for staging partisan spectacles on the taxpayers' dime -- during a pandemic. Those freedom-loving people choosing to assemble at these trumpist bray fests are endangering the lives of others and violating the rights to health and life of all of us.

Shame on you, Pence."
2020-06-26 22:53,"Thank you Governor Cuomo for being a TEAM leader. He brought together the north eastern Governors to battle this epidemic as ONE. No one can argue with the success that WE accomplished. The sacrifices that we have endured are paying off.

It’s like some kind of Kentucky Derby perhaps organised by that son of Kentucky, Moscow Mitch, run by another infamous populist. Trump’s a couple of furlongs in front of the Jair jockey, Bolsonaro, while Boris Johnson is gaining ground on the right. I always thought that populism, based as it is on disdain for the truth and Trumpeting (with a capital T) of simplistic solutions, would lead us to disaster. You bet it has."
2020-06-26 22:46,"Deborah Birx is part of the problem.  Just a few weeks ago, when Donald Trump was encouraging the governor of Georgia to open up commerce, Birx, who was on the stage with the president at the time, replied to a reporter who asked how people could maintain the six-foot distancing in beauty salons, tattoo and massage parlors, replied that the American people are very creative and she was sure they would think of something.  Her reply was not a scientific assessment but a political cover for Trump.  Her credibility was destroyed.  Now, she is concerned about the rising rates of the virus in the South.  It is too late now.  She had her chance to forewarn
people and she blew it.  With Birx, you never whether she is wearing her science or political hat at any given time.  Shame on her."
2020-06-26 23:02,"Desantis and Trump both lack morals, ethics and a conscience. Florida, like America is being treated badly and that won't get better as time goes on. Both Desantis and Trump need to go ASAP and never come back. Let's help them."
2020-06-26 22:39,"The President saying that if you don’t do testing, you don’t have any new cases. Nope, the cases continue to expand exponentially and deciding not to test is akin to deciding to fly an airplane in fog using only visual flight rules, i.e. with no instruments to tell you whether you are flying straight, losing altitude over water or about to plough into a mountain. Children go through a phase where when they put their hands over their eyes, they think they are hidden: if I can’t see you, then you can’t see me. A toddler behaving this way is understandable. But the so-called “leader of the free world” doing essentially the same and more than a few cheering him on? Absolutely beggars belief."

2020-06-26 22:37,"I'd like to make two points:

1.  It has been amply demonstrated that facial coverings and social distancing prevents the spread of this virus.  Everybody in the United States by now is aware of this simple protocol.  

As far as I'm concerned, the situation in the US has deteriorated so severely that this is now a Darwinian issue that transcends politics and even public health.   Its now every man for himself.   Do whatever you need to do to stay safe and to protect your loved ones until a vaccine is developed.  The others will perish and become statistics.

2.  It seems like it was only a few days ago that the only thing we could talk about was ending racism and reforming our police and law enforcement systems.  

Now we have shifted gears completely and are once again preoccupied  -- to the exclusion of everything else -- with this contagion.   It seems to me that it is this very acute inability on the part of Americans to remember things that happened more than two weeks ago that has landed us back to where we were in April."

2020-06-26 22:57,The President and Vice-President are leaders of a technologically advanced country. The holders of those offices should have to pass a science test in order to qualify for those positions. Leaders who are illiterate in science and technology are a danger to society.
2020-06-26 22:58,"It's truly amazing to see DeSantis and Abbot and Ducey acting like the catastrophe they are witnessing came out of the blue-they appear gobsmacked - convinced all was going to be wonderful.  Frankly the experts saw this coming a month ago.  Now frankly it's too late.  They opened the floodgates and the virus is going to rage.  Many will die.  Young people just care about going to the beach and to bars.  Because this doesn't affect many people personally, they have convinced themselves it's not a big deal.   The shocking lack of leadership and disdain for scientific expertise is depressing.   America is a second rate Republic at this point."
2020-06-26 23:42,"The European Union close internal borders when the pandemic affected different countries in different ways.  It is only now reopening those borders but only to countries that meet strict guidelines.  Why doesn't the US emulate a system that worked and close state borders.  Fauci said that the outbreak in the South and West could engulf the entire country.  The obvious solution is to close the borders of the states where the virus is either spreading badly so the virus doesn't get out or close the states that are dong better so no more virus goes in.  If people of a particular state do not want to follow public health guidelines and the viruses increase because of their choice, let them stay in their own state and not put the ret of the country at risk causing another lock-down and further economic distress to those who are abiding by the rules."
2020-06-26 23:43,"People around here( working class suburbs of Philadelphia) seem to have decided that, wether or not the science has changed, they have had it with stringent restrictions. The curve, they preceive, has been flattened and they did what was required to achieve that.

He said that county officials will meet soon to consider returning to shutdown, and that if county officials do not act, he as Governor will exercise his responsibility to act for them. In other words, if county officials don’t shut the county down, Governor Newsom will do it.

And the day is not over yet.

The world is watching Trump and Pence openly betray the nation - and deny reality. We will be shut off, allowed to burn ourselves to death.

Trump complained about China, but China cared about their people, and their economy. Trump is in complete denial, while Pence, the Dominionist, is probably thinking he’s doing God’s work by helping to unleash two of the four horsemen of the apocalypse.

Sickness and Death.

I wonder if this a ploy to get the situation so bad, so Trump gets to do what he has yearned to do all along:

1) Declare martial law.

2) Attempt to suppress the election.

Consider: the pandemic data is so stark, any denial is untenable. Therefore, there’s clearly some other agenda at play here. Even before Trump, we saw brutal evidence of how far Republicans will go to damage the country, as long as they can win.

In other words, the soaring death and illness totals are not the result of incompetence. The policy is to “let it burn.” No one in the administration will admit that the GOP leadership is knowingly killing seniors, people of color, and healthcare workers and other essential workers.

Anyone in NYC who had the money to leave is gone. The people who hope to benefit are safe. They have made the rest of us roadkill, to save their wealth.

It’s not about Trump’s personal political power. The very rich in this country, and I know many of them and am not just hypothesizing, are willing to sacrifice Trump - they don’t like him. Ironically, he will become a victim of his own policies; he is, in a sense, also roadkill, duped by fear of defeat into taking the heat for what is essentially a privileged class view that the virus cannot be controlled without wrecking the economy, and that protecting the economy is the priority.

It wasn't as the White House likely falsely stated back then of Trump needing ""TO TAKE A PHYSICAL,"" after he had recently taken one at the White House where all presidents have always taken them.

After Americans witnessed signs at times since 2017 of Trump's inability to speak fluidly; his madness, irritability, threats of violence, and again recently two weeks ago at the West Point graduation speaking, of being unable to walk normally down a ramp, and again unable to lift up a glass of water to his mouth with one hand as in 2017, needing the second hand to do so to drink it; Trump could be suffering from stroke or heart attack risk due also in part to poor diet and excessive weight; or even a risk of suffering brain seizures.

If the latter were the case, we would know for certain that Trump also lied when stating he was taking Hydroxychloroquine to prevent Covid-19 infection; due to a major side effect of taking that drug being an increased risk in suffering seizures.

Americans need to know the complete truth about Trump's health right now, after just warning yesterday the ""Black Lives Matter"" group of ""RETRIBUTION"" coming.

Most days lately I feel like I've fallen down the rabbit hole. In one month in 1918, October, the Spanish Flu killed 195,000 Americans. By the time that virus had ravaged the world two years later, 1/3 of the population had been infected and as far as I know, no one was asymptomatic, people were very ill and 55 million people died worldwide. I'm very concerned that people are now preparing for ""another wave"" and I worry that this time around there will be absolute chaos.

I am a liberal Democrat but I also think it would be a good idea to place road barriers all around the state. Because of your guidance and directions, we have flattened the curve in our state.

Mask-wearing just happens to be a new rule, and it won't be forever...what exactly is so hard about complying with it?  People are required to wear clothes in public, and we don't have crowds of people shouting about how it's their constitutional right not to wear clothes if they don't want to.  Why is a face mask different?"

He was met with riducule, and the practice of handwashing to prevent infecting patients was not put into practice for many years.  That was before the understanding that ""germs"" such as bacteria and viruses were the cause of infectious diseases.

While VP Pence is defending people not wearing the mask, saying
 - it is freedom of speech, it is in the Constitution. Even some Sheriffs in certain States are challenging the order to wear masks. At the certain time, we see Dr. Anthony Fauci from the CDC, pleading and asking people to be cautious and practise, wearing the mask and social distancing.
The E.U. is planning or has decided to bar US travelers to the E.U. The coronavirus is a national pandemic. It concerns everyone, irrespective of age, and no matter who we are. 
What I do not understand is why it is such a challenge, for everyone to come together,  to address this coronavirus problem, To be told to wear a mask, when in public, is not to take away one's freedom of speech or any other form of freedom. All what the Governors of various States are doing is to provide the direction and guidance, working with the health care professionals. To properly combat this pandemic is a joint effort on the part of all citizens. The solution is on our hands - it can be done, by each one of us following the necessary guidelines, and helping each other. This is the message to everyone."

Guess who they’ll vote for in November - regardless of the Covid death toll.  Can anyone say “more massive tax breaks for the wealthy” (paid for by school teachers, plumbers, and nurses).  Seems like a fair trade (to them) for thousands (of other people) dying and hundreds of thousands falling ill.

Say for example Kerala, a southern state has handled the situation very well. Compared to other states in India, Kerala, Karnataka are doing better in containing the spread. In fact, the WHO has praised Kerala state for its superb work in containing the spread of the virus. If people across India cooperate with the respective state administration, soon India might win the war against the virus."

My aunt said recently that it will become 1 mill deaths, which was a joke, but the more time passes, the more I expect the US to become the biggest victim of COVID. 

And, it is easy to blame Trump for it, but I have doubts about that. National healthcare is independent of the current administration. From what we know today, there were first COVID cases in December and January in Germany, long before the public became aware of a new pandemic. Trump's response is a disaster, of course, we might have just learned that the US is currently not prepared for any large disease outbreak."

So the Trump/Pence campaign has total control over whether they want to expose thousands of Americans to potential infection - or not!

Joe Biden isn't doing that. He's in his basement. And he's winning. Why? Because the sitting president commits one blunder after another. Challenging a sitting president should be _hard_, because that president can - simply through good policy - convince the public to vote for him again. That kind of president shouldn't even _need_ any campaign events!

But here we have the opposite. The president is - more or less - responsible for thousands of dead Americans, so his only option is to risk the lives of even _more_ Americans in order to boost his numbers - which have little to do with actual electoral victory.

Instead, he has continued carrying on with his buddy, Putin, and has even tried to get Russia back into the G8, now the G7 from which they were expelled for many bad acts.

I have always had a foreboding feeling that the dumb people will eventually take us all down with them.

Empires have fallen this way throughout human history. They get worn out, corrupt, and then some great tribulation presents itself, and the great bureaucratic mechanisms and foundations of the empire that have been eroded by ware and tear and corruption come crashing down.
We have a completely corrupt society. From our politics to our economic system, everything is frayed. That corrupt system permitted a megalomaniac to be elected as its leader.

Maybe they just don't care.

But one hundred and twenty five thousand dead Americans give mute testimony to the efficacy and zeal of the Trump administration in dealing with this pandemic.  By tomorrow, more Americans will have died from this coronavirus than died in the Korean war.

The US might have squandered borrowed trillions, but due to partisan politics from your so called ""president"" you did not manage to control the pandemic.

As the registered new daily cases approach 50K kindly acknowledge most people are not tested positive until several days after contamination. Even if the states severely hit in the recent weeks close down hard, it will take weeks to limit the growth in new cases.

If the EU won’t let Americans travel to Europe, and they shouldn’t, several key industries are going to suffer.  One more blow to our economy.  We have to start fighting this virus much more effectively now and Trump and Pence are not up to the job.

There is no mention whether or not the returning Americans were California residents.  My suspicion is that many of them, from states other than CA, had left the U.S. for a life of luxury in relatively cheap Mexico (in other words, exploiting and displacing poorer Mexicans) and now suddenly want back in.  They should be transferred to their actual or last-recorded state of residence, not also exploit and endanger CA’s residents just because we happen to border Mexico."

2020-06-27 6:59,The only reason I can think of why testing is still so unavailable in this country is because Trump and his friends want it to be. There has been plenty of time to figure this out. By this point testing should be ubiquitous and free everywhere in the US. It would be consistent with US living standards and the generally accepted American way of life. I guess this is why Trump is a lame duck.

How in the world are we LOSING so badly compared to other countries? Why are so many of us dying?
1. Trump

3. Republicanism  

More than half of America’s registered voters agree that the president is unfit for the office he holds. We have agreed with that assessment for years. Pence is a sycophant, a mannequin chosen for his near invisibility.
In what situation as dire and perilous as the Covid-19 pandemic would the citizens of a major democracy have the “leadership” of men like Trump and Pence forced on them through failure after denial after terrible decisions after streams of lies, as tens of thousands die each month.
Republicanism holds the key. They have the power to push Trump and Pence (Moe and Shemp) out if the picture.

The Democrats are making political hay by emphasizing how much it's spreading and, in effect, blaming President Trump for it, but their strategy, if you can call it that, is to so restrict economic activity that they force the nation into a depression.  We have to stop blaming one another and just get back to work.  People will get sick, people will die, that's not a good thing, but the alternative, an open-ended economic depression with 20+millions of unemployed is maybe worse (?)."
2020-06-27 1:10,"The rise in cases was inevitable, and its not clear why people are surprised.  The lockdowns do not allow immunity to develop; they defer cases but do not prevent them.  Some activities are worse than others; the Times' ""Protest is Patriotic"" editorials likely made things worse.

We need to learn to manage the pandemic, only a vaccine can end it.  We should require masks and limit large scale gatherings (like mass protests).  But we cannot simply reimpose strict lockdowns; these are doing more harm than good, and as the rise is cases demonstrates they defer cases, they don't prevent them.

And here's the important part.  The only thing that will end this is a vaccine.  A vaccine is going to require all hands on deck to develop quickly.  This means we need the help of major pharmaceutical companies.  This past week has produced massive multi billion dollar verdicts, probably unjustified, against two major pharmaceutical companies, Bayer, and Johnson & Johnson.  There are literally tens of thousands more billion dollar lawsuits pending. Whatever you may think of big pharma, right now the world badly needs them.  This is the reality.  Congress must pass tort reform, or we will probably not get the vaccine the world so desperately needs."

The ER doctor who delivered the news to me that I had COVID-19 said he thought two million Americans would die before we developed and distributed an effective vaccine, and even then, only the wealthy might get it.  Since I’m half dead already, do I count as a half-dead American? I’m being wholly left as one."

He sympathized with them - since they had been cooped for long.

Unlike the tone of many commenting below - I thought the briefing was reassuring.

 Even Faucci complimented young for volunteering for tests.  He said they are revealing a lot more about asymptomatic folks.

I live in Bogota, Colombia. In more than 100 days - the number of tests here is just approaching that number - for a country of 49 million.

CDC director also commented how rates of pneumonia have gone down - from 27% to 6% - as older folks are taking more precautions and infections are increasing in younger folks.

He also said medical folks now know more on how to deal with Wuhan - and more importantly what not to do.

Sure, as expected the contentious issue was POTUS rallies.

Failure to address this as a health crisis rather than an economic crisis (or re-election crisis) means that we will now need to address Covid’s exponential growth again, but not with a few hundred cases as background, with tens of thousands."
2020-06-26 17:47,"It is a false choice:

Public Health vs Economic Activity.

You MUST have public health in order to sustain economic activity.  

How many healthy young people without co-morbidities, are in regular contact with people who are -  60 year old parents or 80 year old grandparents or a husband with a heart condition.  

For every one person who knows they are ill with Covid 19, another 3 or 4 persons are affected.  No one is going out for dinner or a movie or the gym if someone you cohabit with is positive with Covid 19 and you all have to quarantine yourselves.  

For every 1 person who dies of Covid 19, how many people will feel too scared and depressed to go out because they lost someone they loved or the disease came too close to home.  

The point of movement and crowd restrictions are to limit surges/spikes in infections so that the healthcare system is not overwhelmed. Just because of Covid 19 doesn't mean cancer treatments, heart attacks, asthma, diabetic shocks, stop.  May be there are fewer road accidents but that's about it.  ICU beds are still needed.    Add Covid 19  to the usual health issues and you have a overwhelmed healthcare system which means poorer quality of care and higher death rates.  

This is so sad and unnecessary."
2020-06-26 18:01,"The tragedy is Governor Abbott’s inability to politically isolate “face mask wearing” from being a political identifier. As a Texas elder, I repeatedly encounter passive-aggressive younger adults who are belligerent about violating physical distancing and adamant mask refusal. A medical office reception room encounter with an “individual-choice” thirtyish male violating posted and verbally communicated rules, knowingly transgressing my physical space with no mask - my blood pressure reading after that bizarre encounter was 25-30 mm hg systolic higher than I’ve ever read. And I have no legal recourse to prevent that “Trumpian” behavior by his acolytes. Abbott’s inability to show concern for elder vulnerability will blow back on him. I hope."
2020-06-27 5:09,I understand that Trump turned his back on the energy industry when it came to passing out free money. This act will probably not enhance his chances in this traditional red state.

They largely were initially withholding testing to people high risk with only two symptoms. Now a large portion of the population is no longer social distancing for many reasons (work, pleasure, protest, etc.) and can easily be tested."
2020-06-26 10:47,"""No single answer fully accounts for the surge of cases among young people..."" 

I think there is only one answer: they didn't believe that they could become infected. The first warnings last winter were that those directly affected were older and less robust. Now, younger people, who lack the discipline and care of those older than themselves, took what they thought were low-level risks, and threw off caution to continue their daily lives without any kind of government interruption.

They were statistics waiting to happen. There is really almost nothing known about this virus and that's why a vaccine is months or years away. But young people are copy-cats and fear to be the hindmost when there's adventure or fun or other social delights to be had.

NYC never had a chance, not knowing that the virus was circulating broadly before March 1, with people in subways for an hour and closed office spaces, crowded bars and theaters. 

NYC was supposed to be our object lesson - don't be like NY in March.

If your viral cases are not well in control, and you have community spread at a rate of over and r0 of 1, you should not have bars, casinos, restaurants, clubs (especially clubs) or large parties. 

This is nothing less than a total failure of government, and society, to assess risk, and take the hard actions to reduce it. The local economy will not thrive, either, if the risk of going out just increases numbers.

Of course young people are being infected. Young people are social, and will frequent risky places if they keep getting told that everything is safe."

So, one piece of good news is that we can expect fewer deaths to emerge from this new wave of cases.  A second piece of good news is that conditions in areas where cases are rising, combined with increased testing, will enable more rapid evaluation of treatments and vaccines for Covid-19."
2020-06-26 11:04,"Isn’t this the outcome of what we want?  A balance between an open economy and fighting the spread.  Those at higher risk of bad outcomes from the virus take more precautions to stay safe and those less at risk keep the economy going and get sick at higher rates.  Why would anyone expect anything different given the reopenings. Unless anyone was expecting a miracle, a resurgence is to be expected and the fact that it’s in young people is a good thing, no? If the resurgence itself is the problem, that’s a totally different headline."

It takes a bit of effort, determination, and a desire to do right by your community. America is always quick to praise the sacrifice of the troops and front line workers because that characteristic of sacrifice is supposed to be at the core of what it means to be American.  But is it? The only sacrifice I’m seeing is the willingness to let tens of thousands of people die and let hundreds of thousands get seriously ill because people don’t want to be inconvenienced or modify their behavior."
2020-06-26 11:04,"I'll probably get some negative responses for saying this, but, depending on where one is, there are people of all ages disregarding social distancing and masking.  In my humble observation,  people in general are bad at following directions (which have also become political and partisan) AND they are terrible at staying away from others. 

I wear a mask any time I come closer than 12 feet from a human being outside my immediate household.  This includes when I'm running,  which is punishing to say the least in the heat and humidity,  but I do it out of love for my neighbors almost all of whom I perceive as more ""high risk"" than myself,  a female distance runner in my 30s who doesn't have type A blood and is not overweight nor on medication.  I teach my daughter the same. Her class had a ""social distance"" gathering outdoors that I did not let her go to because it is unrealistic to expect a child to do what adults and adolescents clearly cannot.

We are a social species,  and it will kill us all if we let it."

2020-06-26 10:18,"And in 20, 40, or 60 years when these careless younger people are older and at greater risk during a different pandemic, I wonder how they will feel when the youth of that time are similarly callous, and are able to add, “Why should WE be careful and lose out on our 20s? You didn’t worry about older people when YOU were young!”
Of course, it’s logical. Kids of anti-vaxers worried only about themselves, ignorant of how we got vaccinated to protect them."
2020-06-26 10:32,"So, if you are infected but have no symptoms, the danger is that you spread the disease to a person who would suffer negative outcome?

I thought that group spread was a key to reach herd immunity?"
2020-06-26 10:17,"These leaders in the southern states are living in denial. The cold sobering reality is that you will be hit hard by not acting in the public interest. I can't believe mask wearing has become a political flash-point. Follow the science. But you are not so now you are getting slammed. It will get worse. That is the reality. And stay out of NY, because we did things right. We sacrificed for the greater good. We were patient and not selfish."
2020-06-26 10:33,"I think we can all agree on a couple points.  1.  Mass protests at which virus will be mass spread are greater value to society as a whole than any damage, direct or collateral to old people, by the virus.   The protests will take down two major targets, Trump and the police.  2.  After sacrificing and enduring the physical and emotional strain from protesting or just watching and supporting protesters, young adults deserve to go out, congregate, imbibe, dance, hook up, etc.

So what is the Issue and why this article???"
2020-06-26 11:03,"It is and had been the case of young asymptomatic carriers spreading the virus far and wide. It would be so until the time we realise we need to change our behaviour to flatten the curve rather than wait for miracles (drugs, vaccines) to happen. Further, we need to decide how valuable is our 'economy'over human life."
2020-06-26 11:04,Wondering whether they were truly asymptomatic. They may have had mild symptoms that they ignored - not even realizing or considering that they could have covid19.
2020-06-26 11:06,"Unfortunately, we have a lot more suffering ahead. The fault lies with all Americans, Democratic and Republican.

The countries who have contained the virus such as China, South Korea and New Zealand have given their government central power. They have given up their privacy so the government can track them and save lives. In the US, we prize our individual freedoms-to go around without masks, to travel freely ignoring quarantines and to operate businesses even if workers might get infected.

Even in a Democratic stronghold such as NY with good leadership, who is stopping infected Americans from other states from coming in. How are we enforcing the 14 day quarantine for Floridians and Texans? What if they don't want to self-quarantine?

A second surge is just waiting to happen in NY and more Americans will die until we get to herd immunity or we decide to give the government some of our personal freedoms in exchange for safety."
2020-06-26 10:35,"A bit confused by this coverage. As a young (23) healthy person, the story I’ve come to understand is that I have a moral duty to socially distance so that I do not spread the virus to others, but am VERY unlikely to be in any physical danger myself from COVID.

This article does not make that distinction clear—seems to suggest that young people are in plenty of danger now.

NYT coverage has done a great job of giving the facts and data, but the clarity of implications and actual danger present for various groups have been inconsistent at best."
2020-06-26 10:46,It would be helpful to know if the age of who is bring hospitalized and who is dying has shifted down dramatically. I hate to be morbid but if it has then that message has to get out as younger people up until now have believed that it will be no worse than the flu. If it hasn't shifted down then the message that has to get out is how selfish the younger people are being by only thinking about themselves and their happiness and now how much damage they are causing to others.
2020-06-26 10:47,"Is virus is spreading to younger people? This may be the artifact of increased testing. In most places younger people were not able to get tested or didn’t bother because they weren’t living in hot spots. Now Florida and Texas are hot spots and the test is widely available, so the young people are flocking to get tested. Testing is now finding the “silent majority” of infected people who didn’t even know they were sick. Epidemiologists have told us for months that there are numerous cases of the virus which are not included in the calculus. This just confirms what we have been told all along. 

 What does that mean? The vast majority will get over it. Some may be asymptomatic. A very very small percentage of these young people will be hospitalized. The fact is that over half of the over 120,000 people who have died were in nursing homes. In my county, half the people who died were in nursing homes. Everyone else was over 50."
2020-06-26 11:10,"There are tons of middle-aged people celebrating at the beaches and lakes.  I see older people at the grocery stores without masks or respecting social distancing. Let’s not look for a scapegoat in young people. 

The fault lies with the administration and (mostly republican) state governments who prioritized the economy and downplayed the virus."
2020-06-26 10:36,"This seems like a logical outcome of easing restrictions. The virus is not gone and the shelter in place rules were intended to 'flatten the curve.' Simply staying at home doesn't make a virus go away - it only slows the spread. 

We are facing unprecedented unemployment, homelessness and other disastrous effects from shutting down society. We have seen a large spike in domestic violence cases, people with other serious health conditions have delayed seeking treatment for fear of going to the hospital. The costs of not re-opening must also be weighed.

Yes, this is a deadly virus for people who have certain risk factors, for most others it is not. What we should be working on is finding ways to protect the vulnerable without destroying lives and livelihoods in the process.

COVID-19 is most likely not the last virus of it's kind we will see. The media needs to stop with the clickbait headlines and fearmongering and our government needs a comprehensive plan to contain infection without destroying lives in the process."
2020-06-26 10:37,It would be helpful to have consistent data so we can compare apples to apples. The reporting should stick to hospitalizations due to covid. Reporting on testing is useless because many asymptomatic people are not tested and the percentage of people being tested vary widely. A month ago we tested x. Now we test y. Of course the results are different and it shows us nothing.
2020-06-26 10:52,"Younger people and the reopening of bars in Florida have proved a volatile mix: it's hard to maintain social distancing in these situations, compounded by inhibitions dulled by the consumption of alcohol. On my way to pick up some takeout, I pass 6-7 bars on a strip dedicated to the establishments, and they all had crowds out on the sidewalk around them, not a mask in sight.

DeSantis, following his guru, Trump, adopted lax reopening guidelines (no masks out of doors), and I'm afraid the rest of the population will pay the price."
2020-06-26 10:59,"Meanwhile, many colleges and universities are preparing to partially reopen and bring students back to campuses, where they will presumably social distance and wear masks to protect those around them. Sure they will. Another surge of the virus waiting to happen, combining the increase in cases among young people with their often carefree attitude toward super-spreader events and activities — all apparently no big deal for leader Trump of course."
2020-06-26 10:44,"This is a classic “I told you so” phenomenon.

It was easily predictable that premature opening up would lead to a new surge of cases.

It was also predictable that the increase would include many more asymptomatic people whose infections were a danger to the more vulnerable, such as older people.

The childhood lesson of learning not to touch a hot stove after once doing so has been forgotten by a great many people, with no exception for political leaders who one might expect to have a more adult sense of responsibility."
2020-06-26 10:47,"I’m in my early 30s and yes some of my peers are getting reckless. But I’d say most people I know including myself have NO choice but to be out working. What are we supposed to do when there’s no safety net in place and the government won’t extend unemployment, refuses to back payrolls like Europe has done, and won’t pass any more direct stimulus? I don’t want my family to go bankrupt and be homeless, my wife and I graduated during the last recession and we’ve struggled so hard for what little we have. Obviously to the politicians in power, the younger working class is expendable."
2020-06-26 11:18,"Given this new influx of cases in the younger populations, is there data on hospitalizations and excess mortality within this cohort?  Looking at the UK data (ONS) where population antibody detection for London was already at 18% of samples at the end of April, excess mortality amongst 0-14 year olds is barely above average, and for 15-44 year olds it is roughly in line with the 2018 flu season.  For older populations it becomes much higher as age increases, and while younger groups of the population will not be able to cut themselves off entirely from more vulnerable populations, isn’t achieving immunity in the less-vulnerable groups the best outcome given that there is unlikely to be a vaccine available for some time?"
2020-06-26 11:19,"There is a plus side to it. We’re not getting a vaccine or cure anytime soon so there’s only one way to get past this without shutting down indefinitely and that’s if enough people get it so that we reach herd immunity. In fact, it’s good if young people get it and quickly. Few of them will have issues and we can return to opening the economy sooner. And hopefully we’ll have a vaccine by the time the natural immunity expires."
2020-06-26 11:21,"The age distribution of those hospitalized has not changed, therefore the age distribution of actual (not detected) cases has not changed.  What has changed is testing criteria.  Now it’s easier for younger people to get tested, so now they are making up a larger fraction of detected cases."
2020-06-26 11:25,"Alabama has been open for weeks. I have indoor and outdoor dined multiple times with no worries or concerns. People of all ages have done the same. It CAN be done safely. That’s a fact. That being said, if we can get some public health officials to tell us WHERE this rise in cases is coming from then that will help. If it’s largely coming from bars and clubs, then we can take targeted action. However, if the answer is “I don’t know” or it spreads amongst asymptomatic younger people doing outdoor activities, then it’s time to mask up and isolate elderly and the vulnerable. There are things we can do and things we should do. Shutting down education systems is something we should not do. We should actively be looking for ways to make in person education work, as best it can. There will be issues,  but let’s not take the easy way from the start. 

Side note: I’ve said this all along...there are no telling how many cases there are and have been in America. Think about the median age of positive tests, three months ago, and tell young people weren’t getting it then."
2020-06-26 10:52,"Dr.Fauci and Mrs. Brix warned repatedly and then came the kids to the California and Florida beaches.

2020-06-26 11:05,"Interestingly that the young seem not to take social distancing seriously is a global prevalent covid-19 era behavioral Phenom.In this Africa's Diplo Cpital cosmopolis of some 6 mill residents people have well adjusted with the mask thing:you can't take a ride,or city train or any public Trans with out wearing them,in shopping malls Churchs,etc too.The police even stop you on the streets and make sure you were them.But in the countless small traditional coffee outlets owned and run by young women (hardly any one goes without downing a small cup or 2, 3 of them a day) enforcing a distance is quite a challenge,the young just insert themselves between customers while we older ones complain and try to remind them about the distancing.In Bars too tables are arranged a meter or longer apart still here too the young seem to worry a lot less about observing it,the violation is not in alarming # but it is the young who do grasp the consequences  a lot less.However,it is the younger Gens future that is more at stake:Once almost all of us clung to the strict discipline requisite to curtail the spread and the Eco dynamism got restored their job opportunity will be a lot more secure.The young just look at the fact that they don't have the symptoms and can physically function and forget that they will be spreaders and a warehouse of the Covid-19 virus and the pay back of which will bankrupt them.Hence a lot wiser to b inconvenienced enough as long as needed not go by just what we wish.TMD."
2020-06-26 11:23,"Young people are typically short attention and rambunctious with high social needs. They may not be affected from exposure to the virus but as they bring it back to their families, elders become infected, hospitalized, and die."
2020-06-26 10:40,"Bottomline, that age group simply feels that, ""Oh I'll just be sick for a few days and then be over it"", so mitigation does not even enter their minds.  While the percentages are lower, that age group can still get severely ill and die, but that is not even in their mindset.  They also just can't get it through their heads that they can spread it to those who are at greater risk of severe disease."
2020-06-26 11:28,I wonder if the mass protests have anything to do with this. The timing seems about right as does the age group.
2020-06-26 11:26,Now that the virus is really in community it is more important than ever that  the vulnerable people shelter in place.
2020-06-26 11:22,"I believe the problem has been the consistent downplaying of the seriousness of the problem in a mistaken fear that the truth will cause panic.
The truth is this virus kills 5 percent of people who are infected.  It infects more people than the annual flu virus which runs at 15 percent every year.  So simple math tells us that this virus has the potential of killing more than 2,400,000 Americans.   The current death count is 130,000.
The only tools we have to fight this are masks and distancing.  This is not a cold where two weeks later you are back to normal.  In many cases there is permanent residual damage to multiple organ systems.  Do not catch this virus hoping for herd immunity."
2020-06-26 11:23,"So interesting how this article emphasizes how ""most people"" were wearing masks at the BLM event. Please. I've seen the pictures. Adriana  could have gotten it there, or at the bar, or of course at the eye clinic where she works. But again, can't get a virus from a virtuous protest, only from a bar or church."

2020-06-26 11:21,Young people were not getting tested much at all in March. Tests were mainly used for the old or vulnerable due to a massive supply shortage. I am shocked that this fact seems go be ignored in the article.
2020-06-26 11:24,"Last night, for the first time since March, I dined out (outdoors) with a friend in NYC.  I'd say about 70% of the folks waiting for their table or walking on the streets were not wearing masks, and they were mostly younger people.  If they had them, they were uselessly positioned around their chin or neck.  It seemed that it was mostly older folks wearing masks.  Same observation on NYC streets and parks.

I fear NYC will soon experience another surge given this behavior."
2020-06-26 11:24,"Historically, viruses weaken as they pass through the population. While there's no perfect scenario—completely devoid of risk—the fact that the young and healthy are getting it and spreading it will make it better for everyone in the long run. 

Anyone who thinks we can hide from this is on fool's errand. Our goal was to ""flatten the curve"", not avoid it completely. COVID-19 is not going away. 

Maybe if we didn't have 31 million diabetics, and our obesity rate wasn't at 36.7%, we wouldn't be in the position we're in."
2020-06-26 11:13,"Many young people have not experienced disease,  They look at aging in weary health as something their elder family members experience, not them.  

In addition, their government leaders have let them down whether state or federal.  Their state leaders have allowed reopening to soon to keep economies going.  Their federal leaders have lied, have not had a clue about keeping them safe, and have even tried to cover up.  

Youth has not had experience - our world has not had global pandemic experience of this magnitude ever before.  Suffering of the sort COVID has caused may seem unreal to youth, remote, foreign.  

And of course many young people do feel invincible.  Perhaps that is even natural of sorts.  

Youth is going to pay the price that they never believed they were at risk for.  Perhaps they didn't take heed, listen, or take precaution. They have exchanged unnecessary chances, temporary enjoyment for sickness not taken seriously.

But how many of us older Americans, after being lied to, and hearing various reporting from leaders, words from those who should have kept us safe, have felt like taking off the masks and going out to have a good time?  

It is our life experience, of seeing and dealing with health struggles in aging that has made us fear. And perhaps that has kept us safer rather than youth who have thrown safety to the wind or days on the beach or gathering in bars.They have chosen friends instead of solitary and loneliness. And now they pay the price."
2020-06-26 11:19,"This exactly what we want. 
Infected but most with no symptoms. 
Economy restarting. 

Pivot the quarantine strategy from everyone to only the vulnerable. We need a national investment plan in reimagining nursing homes.  Spread people into more buildings and focused daily testing of caregivers. Others who are vulnerable stay in quarantine - with the subsidies and services to support them not everyone. 

I truly wish we had leadership in Congress and from the President."

2020-06-26 11:43,"Testing makes it clear that young people are infected by the virus. It may be true that those young people will not die in great numbers from the disease. That does not mean that their infections are benign.
Some of those young people will spread their disease to more vulnerable people. That asymptomatic spread is one of the scariest aspects of this pandemic. If you see a young person happily going about without a mask, you should feel afraid. 
You are also justified in feeling angry because of the lack of concern and respect for others reflected in that behavior. Wearing a mask is a pretty small thing to do, even if you don't truly believe that it makes a difference."

2020-06-26 11:54,"I have to wonder if massive protests are causing some of the virus surges in younger people. Infection is based on three factors: the presence of the virus, the viral load in the air, & the time of exposure. If you're shoulder to shoulder with someone outside shouting and singing for more than 10 minutes, then you're putting yourself at great risk. Someone passing you on a sidewalk is not likely to get you sick, but standing alongside them for hours will if they are infected. Just last month we were condemning people for going to beaches and pool parties for just this reason. While the protests and their causes are certainly more noble and necessary, the risks are exactly the same. Masks will help, but only if everyone wears them. And everyone is clearly NOT wearing masks.  I've seen too many people in videos and pictures without masks.  Just one infected person....just one....can cause a massive outbreak. I support the ideas fueling the peaceful protesters. But I can't help but think if there is a second tinder box being lit by the protests that will cause COVID cases to spike again with devastating effects for the country. There has to be a safer way to do this that does not compound the devastation the nation is already experiencing from COVID. The experts estimate that masks cut transmission by about 50%. But it is still a big risk to be in a LARGE CROWD of SHOUTING PEOPLE! Instead of risking other people's lives, protestors should do what is most effective...VOTE!"

I was a opining about how selfish people are and how unwilling they are to self sacrifice for the better benefit of everyone else. During World War II, there were severe rationing on goods such as meat, tires, gasoline, clothing, etc. I wonder if, under similar circumstances, how well the population today would be willing to put up with such inconveniences as our Grandparents did back during that war and not only do so for a few months, but for years.  Going out to a club is clearly not a “need”; being able to breathe air and touch surfaces not already contaminated by COVID is a need.  If you cannot do this for yourself, do it for your family, your grandparents, your friends. Later, they will thank you for it."
2020-06-26 11:56,"“Is it the governor’s reopening? Is it Memorial Day? Is it the George Floyd demonstrations? Is it going to the beach?” said Eric Boerwinkle, dean of the UTHealth School of Public Health in Houston. “We don’t really know, but it is probably all of those things that are contributing.”

Why is this surprising? It was bound to happen. Protests in the midst of a pandemic + states reopening long before they should have + young people eager to get back to normal.

But our lives are not normal in the midst of pandemic. It's just unfortunate that too many young people don't have the common sense to realize that. I would have hoped that they have elders in their lives who could offer some wisdom. It would be a shame if they ignored what they might have had to say."
2020-06-26 11:43,"I’m not surprised by these new statistics.

Last week at the Jersey shore we witnessed beach rental houses full of college kids, up on the balconies and spilling out onto the street, shoulder to shoulder and without masks, partying like there’s no tomorrow.

New Jersey has enjoyed a flattening of its Covid19 curve through discipline and sacrifice but this will surely reverse that hopeful and well earned trend.

It’s going to be a long summer..."
2020-06-26 11:46,My friend has a nephew (young man) that has tested positive for Covid. He felt fine so he still wanted to go out and socialize.  Didn't see what the big deal was.  Luckily his parents forced him to quarantine.
2020-06-26 11:55,"It's a mistake to focus just on the death rate.  Even for the ""survivors"", COVID-19 is a horrible disease.  Hospital stays average 2- 3 weeks and the convalescence, after the virus is gone, can last for a couple of months, with symptoms very similar to the active disease.  Many survivors suffering permanent disabilities.  

The fact that young people are less likely to die than the elderly doesn't mean that it's ""no big deal"" because they can still suffer horribly for a long time and often for a lifetime."
2020-06-26 11:51,"COVID-19 IS REPORTED To be less serious with younger, healthier people are infected.  For us seniors with underlying medical conditions, that makes going out for essential items more risky, though if we observe social spacing and wear masks, we'll have some protection against catching the virus.  My plea would be that young people treat themselves with kindness and wear masks, so they don't have to catch COVID-19 in the first place, and so that they can protect others from becoming infected.  The steep increase in cases means that COVID-19 is going to spread much faster than it had been.  It's unrealistic, but shutting everything down again would be the best defense against a rapid increase nationwide.  What I think is most dangerous is that Trump neglected to warn us, even though information was available to him in January of 2019!  Also he closed the White House Office on Global Pandemics that was designed to be an early warning system.  On top of that, Trump has encouraged people to disregard medical advice.  That seems to be the worst abuse of power to date.  How many people will become infected and/or die from COVID-19 because of Trump's seemingly criminal neglience?"
2020-06-26 11:43,"Quick look shows lots of comments about herd immunity.

Sorry, folks, but we have no idea whether being exposed to the virus provides *any kind* of lasting immunity for an individual.

How do people not understand that  we will need a significant time period... 6 more months minimum, a year, maybe two years... to acquire enough data to figure that out?

Until we know the answer, minimizing the spread so that it doesn't establish a permanent foothold in the population is the only rational course."
2020-06-26 12:01,"It's time for us to stop obsessing over the daily reported cases. As the CDC reported, based on antibody studies, we have radically undercounted infections.  The virus is everywhere and we are not going to stop it, nor do we know if a vaccine will emerge in reasonable time or if it will even have lasting effect.  What we should be tracking in the news media is hospital resource usage rates - this is what should be guiding decisions on restrictions."
2020-06-26 11:51,"In April, while the Coronavirus was decimating the NYC region, and had already proved very deadly in Italy and China, it was beyond comprehension that governors in the south and west were ignoring the coming storm.

Everyone understands what “ freedom, and “liberty” look like. It doesn’t, however, apply in a pandemic when thousands are dying and the virus is being transmitted asymptomatically. Freedom does not mean going without a mask as you pass along the virus. It does not mean being purposely ignorant of the facts, And it doesn’t mean thinking it won’t happen to you as you infect your family and friends.

The real freedom fighters are those keeping a low profile, wearing their masks, washing their hands and exhibiting personal responsibility...remember that mantra “ personal responsibility?”

The governors of these new states showing spikes are irresponsible, ignorant and a threat to all of us. Even today, many of them are refusing to quarantine their population. 

I know these governors want their economies to boom despite the safety risks. Who doesn’t? But this self defeating behavior is life threatening. And few people,taking a chance and traveling, will travel to these these states...many of which depend on tourism dollars. I won’t.

Meanwhile responsible citizens across America are following the rules that have proven effective. They are doing without for the safety of their communities. 

They are the ones truly cognizant of the true meaning of freedom."

2020-06-26 12:02,"I see a couple of comments this morning blaming Mr. Trump for this new upsurge in infections amongst younger people.

Adriana Carter, among the newly infected and quoted in this article, said ""we were told we could go out to bars... it’s very unusual for anyone in their 20s to stay at home all the time.""

How is her decision Mr. Trump's fault?"
2020-06-26 12:03,"This is poetic justice.  While the rest of us follow the rules wear masks social distance the data shows we should be ok.  But the younger generation has always had a i,me and mine attitude will get the virus and get very sick.  Just follow the rules it is not all about you now."
2020-06-26 12:23,"I appreciate that this is a multi-faceted issue, but I wish there were more discussion in the article of the structural forces at work here. I know people in their 20s and 30s who were sick at the early onset of the outbreak and could not get tested to save their lives. Now that we are in a less dire state of triage it's completely unsurprising that this previously neglected population would see a spike in positive test results - we've known for months that the disease spreads swiftly and silently among exactly this group.

We all need to take responsibility for the health of our communities, but at a certain point the discourse of personal accountability becomes a fig leaf for wider systemic failure. I feel for the person interviewed here who met a friend one time and then came down with COVID - how many Americans can honestly say they haven't violated a single precept of social distancing, even once, over the past four months? And where does this leave us with similar risks that have a strong moral imperative on the other side, like demonstrating or voting?

Public health measures that take neither human nature nor human frailty into account are not worthy of the name. And when our politicians and leaders drag their feet on more robust measures, we need to be clear-eyed and unrelenting in understanding who is responsible, and holding them accountable."
2020-06-26 12:23,"I for one will continue to practice social distancing and hygiene measures for my own good and that of my family and friends.

That’s the prevailing thought among the non-mask wearing doubters. 
By the time they know someone who is sick, we all are, then it’s too late.
We have (especially in recent years) been a country of independence, freedom and rights. (Rarely responsibilities.) 
These may be the things that do us in.

2020-06-26 12:07,"The spread of cases from the dense eastern states to  other parts of the country was widely predicted.  Of course those who mingle freely, without precautions due to the politicization of the virus are going to end up super spreaders--young, unworried kids who frequent packed bars and beaches, perhaps contracting the virus unknowingly and often without symptoms who keep mingling with people of all ages and health conditions.

There's no other word for the unmitigated disaster that is the US response to Covid-19. The charts tell it all, and why we lead the world in cases behind perhaps Brazil.  Our allies--former allies I should call them, in Europe and Canada shake their heads at the total abdication of leadership that has led to 50 different state strategies for containing this pandemic.

Facts are facts, and until people start accepting their role in protecting those around them, it will only get worse."
2020-06-26 12:15,"These government's can't have it both ways. The same thing happening in Florida is happening in Texas.

You can't tell everyone the economy has to reopen, that it's everyone's duty to reopen the economy and go back to work and consume, and that no one is going to enforce masks....you can't do that and not expect cases to go up. Particularly in the age groups where people are working and out in the population consuming.

What was the point of opening things up if you didn't want people going and spending money at those places.

This is a scape goat situation."
2020-06-26 12:11,"I have an ER MD friend who says she bows to the virus every day, in humility, because it is simply confounding, hitting some -- including young healthy vibrant men and women -- very hard... And tho they may not count toward the death stats, many will be severely damaged for life. 

So... as we think about re-opening colleges and universities in the Fall, we should ask... Did it hit the elderly so hard in the first wave because they were elderly or because they lived in dorm-like conditions called nursing homes? And is it really worth the risk to run such a dangerous experiment at this point?"
2020-06-26 12:14,"How can there be any aligned, coordinated position on the virus when health care for all is a foreign concept that is being politicized?  Then you layer on the fact that your federal and state governments are at odds with providing a response that adequately addresses this monumental risk to the American people.  From day one in Canada, politics was never on the table, it was focus on a mutual foe, the virus, and take care of the people.  Conservative/Republican province of Ontario quickly mobilized its efforts with that of the Liberal/Democrat  federal government, no drama, finger pointing, campaigning exercise.  They did what were elected to do, take care of the people.  Why do Americans set the bar so low with their federal and state governments, to the deferment of their families and friends?"

No actually you weren’t trying to do the best you can. I primarily blame her state for its recklessness but it’s not that hard not to go to a bar for a little while. At least she’s quarantining.

I’m in a state where cases are declining, but live in an area where the majority of people who are in groups at the lake and at local restaurants outdoors are in their teens and 20s. Yesterday I saw a whole long picnic table of maybe 20 teens, no masks. Parents really need to reel in their teens right now and it’s only going to work if all parents work together to do this. The problem is the individualist mentality combined with lack of government guidance on how to do this. If there was more leadership on these issues at federal, state and local level it wouldn’t fall to people to make their own reckless decisions."
2020-06-26 12:21,What would be far more disturbing is if the new cases were among the older population. It's empirical fact that younger people are far more likely to weather the virus without any permanent harm. Why on earth would they catch this as a negative trend? Oh I know...

2020-06-26 12:06,"The tonality of this article is bothersome.  This epidemic is NOT completely based on individual choice - now that governors have opened up bars and retail businesses again, many younger people are now headed back to work! What are the average ages of baristas or restaurant servers in America?  Is it over 45?  These jobs that have recently opened their doors disproportionally employ younger people, and many people in their 20s-40s cannot afford to forego a paying job, especially because they often don’t have debt and lack substantial savings.  As an overly conscientious young person, I have been trying to stay as safe as I can, though, my mostly stay at home job has required me to travel, sometimes overnight.  If I were older and had more clout at my job (which could not ever be considered essential), I would definitely not be leaving the house. It feels as though I have to choose maintaining a good reputation at work, or risking my health and my family’s heath.  People of all ages are beginning to eat out, go on vacations, and travel.  Pinning the resurgence of cases entirely on the selfish whims of younger folk misses some of the complexity that may be happening at this time."
2020-06-26 12:18,The idea that young people that get infected with COVID are largely asymptomatic is not new. It could be good or bad that a large part of our society could get infected without being sick. If we want to understand if this gets us closer to herd immunity we need to check for antibodies in this asymptomatic group. Otherwise we’re still in the dark.
2020-06-26 12:18,"The lawyer who dressed as the Grim Reaper as he combed Florida beaches began warning people over a month ago. Sadly, those Floridians decided that ignoring warnings and going out to swim in a metaphoric rip tide - with no lifeguard on duty - was a better option than just staying put at home. 

For anyone who has almost drowned in a literal ocean riptide, it is one of the scariest experiences a person can have. The power of the ocean over a human body is realized too late, leaving a person to fight for their life. Even if one is a strong swimmer, even if one makes it to shore, the risk of water in the lungs can be dangerous and deadly. 

Covid-19 illness sounds even worse. The stories of those who recovered but will still have long-term health problems are terrifying. It only takes a few minutes to drown in a riptide. Suffering from Covid can last weeks, months or years. 

Sadly, the death of expertise, rejection of science and facts, and malicious spewing of disinformation is having a lethal effect on our citizens."

While I see mentions by college leaders of what they plan to (try to) do to keep students, faculty and staff safe on campus, I see nothing about safety for residents who are exposed to students living, jogging, shopping, going out to eat and drink in the neighborhoods.  Massachusetts has done a great job in turning the virus numbers around (kudos to Gov. Baker, even though I’m a Democrat).  How will Boston and other large cities and towns that receive a great influx of students from all over be protected from 1) those already harboring covid-19 asymptomatically and 2) typical behavior of young people who are not taking precautions and are spreading the virus?"

Yes we are more susceptible to negative consequences from Covid-19 infections just as we as a demographic are more susceptible overall to disease. That doesn’t mean that those younger and healthier can be complacent about infections. We are only beginning to understand the dynamics of this virus including having little idea of the long term consequences of even minor infections. It has been pointed out frequently that this is not the “flu” and unusual patterns of negative health outcomes are already cropping up in younger populations. We are playing a dangerous game of Russian roulette with the overall health of the nation including its economy by this increasingly incompetent approach to the pandemic. 

The politicalization of this “disease” by Donald Trump has been a disaster for our nation. The irony that is apparently lost on Trump is that had he “risen” to the occasion instead of the deliberately ignorant approach he took its likely his reelection would have been assured. Regardless, how much more damage will he be allowed to do by his enablers within the Republican Party before they recognize that he is a long term threat to “everyone’s” welfare not just his own.

And Dr. Boerwinkle feigns a most convenient self-absolving ignorance over the source of the infections - like he really doesn't know but saying so might, well, be a career buster.

There has been a concern from day one of this pandemic that the virus would be spread by selfish, young people, unconcerned about contracting the virus themselves.

The health officer here has been supported by the politicians and while certainly there might be more breakouts, I was able to send my children back to school last week for a couple of days without fear. I also remember, in the beginning, seeing a social media post by a former student of mine, in his early 20s, urging his friends to stay home.

This is a good thing. This virus is not serious for young people, so the changing share of infections from young people suggests older and higher risk patients are successfully social distancing and the overall disease burden given the number of cases will be lower.

It is uncommon that they are even hospitalized.  Whereas, for people 60 and over, this is a very deadly disease.  For people over 70, about 45% of those who get infected will be hospitalized, and about 40% of those hospitalized will leave the hospital dead.

No one lets the risk of traffic accident deter them from normal activities.  People under 60 therefore just don't worry about contracting this virus.  Many of them are also totally inconsiderate of those who are older and for whom this disease is very deadly.

Until and unless there is either a vaccine or a very effective treatment, masks should be required for everyone whenever they are in public, indoors and outdoors.....and the requirement should be enforced by arrest and prosecution, not just given lip service."
2020-06-26 12:31,Pairing this article with the Arizona ER doctor's plea to wear face masks in this morning's paper leaves me wondering about ageism in our culture and the lack of any sense of duty to care on the part of younger Americans.  Perhaps they act this way because they have seen older Americans behave just as recklessly in response to the climate crisis.  It would certainly help if our political leadership showed a common front and worked together to overcome the obstacles to responsible action.  Instead we get things like North Carolina's Republican Lt. Governor suing the Democrat Governor for delaying the reopening of the State in the face of exponential growth of infection rates.  We get Trump and the entire executive team refusing to mandate wearing masks in public or modeling the behavior in their own public appearances.  How can we expect citizens to behave more responsibly than our elected leaders?
2020-06-26 12:46,"There is certainly an age discrepancy to this. In my Brooklyn neighborhood, the vast majority of people over 40 wear face masks and give you a wide distance on the sidewalk.

It can reduce your oxygen which is what doctors are now noting.  BUT there are significant numbers of recovered which I think is not reported as the numbers of 'infected' are so we should view this statistic as a medically necessary reporting, and perhaps a way to 'limit' the current cases.  
Whether or not this is a come-back from polio vaccinations, the virus seems to produce immunity.  
First we had the elderly, the workers were next but the economy shut down, closed schools, libraries, community centers, so we've actually had very little chance for herd immunity.  
So this virus may continue and the social distancing is to delay a mass acquisition overwhelming our medical system."
2020-06-26 12:53,"I was thoughtless at age 18-22. So were my friends.

And yet colleges will reopen for full residency. Any bets as to what will happen?  Some young folks do develop complications that can stretch for months. The after effects, however, appear from what we know of COVID to be life-long. 

It is not merely Trump putting money and keeping his job ahead of human life. That Cynical calculus is happening among senior administration in colleges and universities, nationwide."
2020-06-26 12:31,"While I can attribute much of this to a lack of leadership and politicizing the virus, this does little to counter my bias that many, not all, younger people are selfish, often poorly educated despite over a decade of school, and in general have no idea of what it means to be a citizen. The idea was we could get back to work, not partying and acting like fools. Imagine if this virus affected young white people. What would be happening then? What would the little darlings be asking for in that scenario?"
2020-06-26 12:55,"There is a direct connection between youth and a feeling of invincibility.  I am now almost 61, and remember vividly experiencing that in my 20s and 30s.

What is DIFFERENT about the current generation of young people is that they were raised on the internet, where there are neither boundaries nor hierarchy.  Where there is generated the so-called ""fear of missing out.""  Where social media does not necessarily distinguish between fantasy and reality.  

All of which has led to a sharp decrease in an already declining propensity among Americans to think critically."

2020-06-26 12:40,"No vaccine on the near horizon, our children are unemployed just when they should be building careers, risking permanent professional and economic damage, delaying marriage and families. If there were an end point, I would agree their behavior is reckless and selfish. With no end point in sight, I would say the burden of this virus has to lay primarily on those of us who have had careers, families, and enjoyed economic success. We cannot consume our children’s lives just so we boomers can continue to consume in perpetuity."
2020-06-26 12:43,"The interesting question here is why is it the US alone, among advanced industrialized states, that is incapable of bringing this virus under control? The answer to that question is fascinating and multi-faceted. The overwhelming selfishness exhibited by many Americans may well be a direct product of an American society that valorizes ""individual rights"" without any consideration for corresponding duties and responsibilities. It reflects the hatred of expert opinion and knowledge that is so much a part of right wing rejection of science. It speaks to the failure of American social welfare and healthcare, that requires so many people to have jobs if they want to ensure access to a doctor. This virus has laid bare the utterly profound failures of American ideologies - or, at least, the incredibly dangerous way in which American ideology has mutated into the anti-government, tribalist version practiced by the Republican Party."

2020-06-26 12:55,"This is an scorched outcome, back in May why couldn’t we extend the quarantine for 2-3 more weeks. We’d be out and about safely and improving our economy. Not only that, yesterday Texas lead a lawsuit to remove Obamacare? Isn’t that ironic the state that is setting an uptick wants less people to be protected against Coronavirus? That’s the equivalent of sending soldiers without the bare minimum of a helmet. 

To my fellow young people, yes we might not die from COVID-19 but that doesn’t mean we won’t need to quarantine or go to the hospital. We’ll be spending more money in the hospital than what we’d spent the night we went out without any precaution. In addition, of course if you don’t develop any symptoms you’ll be spreading the virus to your friends and families, which then continue to spread it. So try let’s try to avoid large gatherings, wear a mask, wash your hands, and keep your distance."
2020-06-26 12:57,"I am 77 years old.  Yesterday at 3:00pm I went to a convince store to get a chocolate shake.  It was a bit busy, surprisingly.  In the 5-6 minutes I was in the store about 8-10 kids were without masks.  They were 10-14 years old.  They pulled their tee shirts up to cover their mouth and nose.  They pulled the tee shirt down to talk, which was most of the time.  Then a man about 45 walked in without a mask, reeking of pot and a defiant expression on his face.

I left without ordering. 

It is the over-60 group who die from this virus.  So, it is this age group who must stay at home.  I, for one, am tired of isolating at home.  So I go out to walk in my safe, upper middle class neighborhood.  Just walk.  I take 3-4 walks a day and have since March.

Young people’s lives have been upended since March.  Very few of them have jobs.  Criminals infiltrate peaceful protests.  Billions of dollars of destruction have come from property destruction during protests.  Parents have been furloughed and no money coming in.  Our country is very stressed from all this.

Until we get a vaccine, things will be in turmoil.  But only the elderly with underlying health issues are dying.  Young people are the vectors of the vaccine.  But the elderly die from it.  Let’s be clear where the risk lies."
2020-06-26 12:41,"My U.S. family in Wisconsin are getting reckless with this and it is extremely disheartening to see an even split among my friends all over the US - half taking it seriously and anxious they could get it or spread it to their older, sometimes sicker relatives, and another half that has completely gone back to normal. Including my sister who is throwing a wedding with 40 people in two weeks. When pressed if this is perhaps irresponsible, the response is ""we can't just stop our lives.""

The callous disregard for others and the idea of shared sacrifice is just disheartening. And at this rate, who knows when I'll be able to see my friends and family again. The EU is hopefully going to ban American travellers - a wise choice - and it's American's responsibility to hold their government responsible for the lack of a cohesive, coordinated plan to fight this."
2020-06-26 12:53,"My wife and I have been at home since the start of April and have only ventured out to get groceries or prescriptions. Each time I go, I am disheartened by the number of people not wearing masks. It doesn’t help to have the president and vice-president flaunting the mask wearing “guideline”. Especially since the vp is the “head” of the “coronavirus task force”. There are a lot of misinformed people who will take this as a signal that wearing masks is optional.

When historians look at the history of this pandemic, it will show a much larger portion of the population has been affected simply because they followed the example of our leaders. We need to get new leaders ASAP!"
2020-06-26 12:41,"it is a mystery why educated young people refuse to wear masks in this country.

  Researchers say anywhere from 25 percent to 80 percent of people with COVID-19 are unaware they have the virus.

  When you’re dealing with a virus like that, everything we can do to break the chain of transmission is exceedingly important because there are people who are spreading the virus and are not aware of it.
 
This allows the novel coronavirus to spread more rapidly throughout a community.

People with no symptoms are the source of 44 percent of diagnosed COVID-19 cases.

Experts say these carriers without symptoms make it even more important for people to wear face masks in public.

Facemasks should be made mandatory just like wearing the seatbelts while driving. This rule should apply to even our president."
2020-06-26 12:59,The South/Southwest will suffer because AC is now the equivalent of what heating was in March in NYC and the Northeast. These places cannot exist without AC in the summer and the air circulation of AC makes social distancing useless.
2020-06-26 12:44,"It is now testing time for young people. And by testing, I mean  empathy, civic duty, and basic math understanding. i.e. rates of transmission, exponential regimes.. etc.  After all, they are young, but they are no longer children."
2020-06-26 12:54,"I'm not surprised when I see teens and people in their early 20s not wearing masks.  But when I see older people in their 30s on up not wearing them, not maintaining a physical distance of 6 feet from each other, and gathering in large groups,  I am a bit dismayed.  They are old enough to have common sense and understand that they are not invulnerable, invincible, or immortal.  

This is not a game where bluff and lies carry the day.  This is a virus that doesn't ask questions before it infects a body.  If adults can't understand that I have questions about their ability to understand other aspects of adult life, particularly the ones that include working and playing well with others."
2020-06-26 12:53,"As a millenial, some of the cries of selfishness I see in the comments here ring hollow.

Yes, younger people need to take basic precautions, including wearings masks. Still, many of us need to go to work. Unemployment benefits are running out soon and there's no promise of any program renewals. And it turns out that that $1200 stimulus check isn't enough to live on for very long.

Some of us have kids and we're wondering whether 3 months of social isolation is good for them, let alone our own sanity. It's much easier to say stay home when all of your kids are grown up.

Meanwhile, government action to assist wealthy retirees (and those near it) has been quick and effective.  The market is back to where it was in March 2019 (when it was _already_ remarkably high after explosive growth for 10 years). This is thanks to an unprecedented response by the government to help banks and large corporations. And it's great for anyone who's had time to put away money in their 401Ks.

The problem is that young have far less risk (last week 9 people under 45 passed away from COVID compared to 262 45+) so we're less afraid, but our political leaders have done a horrible job of telling us exactly what sacrifice we are supposed to make. Are we staying inside now so that we can go out again in 6 months when the virus is still around and we still have no vaccine? Should we just stop our lives indefinitely? What exactly is the plan?"
2020-06-26 13:04,"I didn't see any mention of the fact that younger people make up a disproportionate chunk of the service employees who we've forced to go into work because our social safety net is woefully insufficient. Remember that employment surge last month? It was made mostly of service level employees being sent back to work out of necessity. Are some of these people just being frivolous? Of course, but let's not ignore the fact that younger people are in more precarious financial situations and don't have a choice but to go and expose themselves."
2020-06-26 13:06,"I got shingles a few months ago...at age 35.  It was a sign of things to come.  If I can get something like shingles, then there's definitely a chance I can catch COVID-19.  I shutter to think how so many would take such a chance when some of us are trying so hard to stay alive and safe.  

I now fear the future."
2020-06-26 13:01,"Of course people have given up. The government gave up on us. If the government doesn't take it seriously, the people won't. Mixed messages abound. ""You should wear masks and social distance, but it isn't necessary. It's not safe for us to open businesses, but the economy is more important than your health."" The government isn't covering medical expenses for illnesses people get while they are unemployed. 

People don't just get coronavirus. They get sick in many other ways, and without a job, there's no way to pay medical bills. Conversely, if they have to go back to work anyway, the government is sending them the message that the virus’ existence is irrelevant as well. So they go on with their lives as though it doesn't exist. After all, the government denies it, and they deny us. What a tragedy for such a great country."
2020-06-26 13:08,Have there been studies on how many of these young people were part of the demonstrations or close to someone  who was?  Isn’t this just about the time it would start to happen ?
2020-06-26 13:00,"I have doubts it is the protests that are driving the increased rates.  I live in Minneapolis and rates are not going up in the Twin Cities.  People have been protesting-- many of whom have been wearing masks.  The states that have rising cases are states that are not encouraging or mandating social distancing and wearing masks in public.  Those Republican states that believe that being asked to wear masks is an afront to their individual rights-- until the virus kills a mother, a father, a grandparent."
2020-06-26 13:06,"How many of us remember the spring break partier who said, “If I get the corona, I get the corona.”?

2020-06-26 13:14,"As I understand it, the proportion of people who've had the infection in population as a whole is around 7%. If the ""social"" generation is two or three times more likely to have been infected, that's close to 20%. And if that figure is perhaps double in the most vulnerable places, like New York with its airports, mass transit etc., then in the most exposed groups, as many as 40% might already have been infected.

While we know the concept of herd immunity is rather politically unacceptable, it looks like there are some areas where it be close to being achieved."
2020-06-26 13:14,Modeling is very important.  I live in the city of Chicago in a neighborhood with majority young residents.  Most young people are wearing masks.  As most people of every age group.

Based on anti body testing, that is what happened in NYC, especially in minority communities. The uptick is mainly the result of large scale protest marches and parties by young people, mostly minorities. Although liberal pundits supported their actions as the protests were largely directed against Trump ""the racist, now it appears that they compete to blame Trump for the the uptick."
2020-06-26 13:18,"Once you make up your mind that social distancing, wearing a mask when you leave home, and washing hands is a NECESSARY part of life now - for some time into the future - it’s like anything else that is necessary.

Maybe wearing clothing, for example, is annoying when it’s really hot out.  But nevertheless, we keep our clothes on in public.  

We stop at stop signs.  We don’t park in a disabled parking spot.  We stay within the speed limit.  

These are all things that benefit all of us.  And we do them without whining or claiming that no one has right to ask us to do things for the common good.

It’s common sense and politeness to go along with norms and laws which are beneficial for the safety and well-being of society.  And politicians who generate divisiveness and non-compliance with rules made for our health and safety have lost the main reason anyone should run for office - which is Public Service.

It pains me greatly that our society has become so driven by a glorification of “individualism” - that we are losing a sense of “we-ness” of “we’re all in this together.”

It’s not a majority who are urging such nonsense and incivility.  It’s making us into a pariah nation.

2020-06-26 13:17,"I keep hearing people say, ""I used to wear a mask, but it was uncomfortable.  I got tired of living in fear.  I decided to stop worrying and just live my life.""  Such sentiments reveal profound ignorance--or profound selfishness.  You wear a mask for everyone else.  Same for social distancing.  You probably could weather Covid-19 pretty well, but that is not the point.  Plenty of your fellow citizens will not weather it well, and may even die.  You say you are trying to keep the economy going?  The most helpful thing you can do for the economy in the long run is to wear a mask and practice social distancing.  Seems Americans have largely lost our civic-mindedness.  Many even appear to equate making small sacrifices for the good of the society with forfeiting one's rights and independence.  For god sake, wear a mask for Grandma."

People were told, and are still told today, to think of their elderly grandparents and older relatives.  Stay home to protect the elderly.  Wear a mask to protect those you care about who may have underlying health issues.  Do it for others.

As it turns out, this may not have been the best or most efficient way of introducing this horrific virus to the general public.  The introduction of this new virus did not effectively address the issue for those whose minds travel only on one track: What's In It For Me?

If Covid 19 had been introduced as a danger of varying degrees to all, the national response might have been  different.  Sadly, we'll never know.  Even sadder still is the number of folks now getting the disease who thought their 'age' gave them immunity.

2020-06-26 13:24,"I'm very worried about what's going to happen in September, two weeks after millions of college students all over the country go back to college.

The college where I teach is in a small town of 10,000 people.  We have two colleges in our town, which will bring about 4,000 students into the town.  There's a similar town 10 miles away, which means 8,000 students from all over the region/country will potentially be bringing more of the virus (and new strains of it) into our community.  We all share one Walmart; and there's only one main hospital.

The ""precautions"" that the colleges are taking are woefully inadequate.  Distancing and masks won't prevent transmission when groups of people spend an hour together in a classroom for an hour, breathing the same air repeatedly (and doing this 2-3 each day).  Having students sign ""social contracts"" won't keep them from going to bars any more than our regular ""rules"" do.  Even with housing them all in single dorm rooms, each hallway or wing will be like a family of 20 people in one house sharing just 2 bathrooms; and we've all read stories of entire families getting the virus from just a single birthday party.

Then, our custodial staff will have to go into stairwells once an hour to wipe down all the railings after students move between classes.  They're the ones most at risk for getting the virus and bringing it home to their familes.

Now multiply this times 5,000 colleges around the country."

I guess too many folks are unconcerned, lack the citizenship needed for their neighbor's protection - especially seniors - and their own protection.  Dr. Fauci has mentioned many, many times about States opening too soon, the need for social distancing and to wear a face mask outdoors.

In NYS and NYC every elected politician from Governor Cuomo to Mayor de Blasio and the entire NYC Council failed to take action when the pandemic struck in record numbers to make it 'compulsory' for everyone to wear a face mask when they are outdoors.

Way too many folks in my Midtown Manhattan - Turtle Bay neighborhood aren't wearing a face mask and aren't social distancing in three neighborhood city parks - Peter Detmold, Sutton Place and Dag Hammarskjold Plaza.  

And, what's this nonsense wearing a face mask covering their chin?

I think if our elected politicians don't step up to the pale and make wearing a face mask compulsory - it may be like it's happening in Texas , Arizona, Oklahoma and Florida - NYS and NYC will be added to the list for increased COVID-19 victims."

In North Texas one infection cluster shows dire concerns: On May 30 a single relative spread the virus to 18 other relatives, all of whom apparently were practicing social distancing guidelines. 

“It wasn’t that long. It was only a couple of hours,” Barbosa, a volunteer EMT said. “But during that brief time, somehow the other 18 family members are now infected with COVID.”

Barbosa, who is also married to a doctor, said he and his wife refused to go to the party due to safety reasons. However, it was a party that by current state health standards appeared harmless. A total of 25 people attended, and not all of them arrived and stayed for the same duration. Among those infected are two young children, two grandparents, a cancer patient and Barbosa’s parents, who are in their 80s. Three are now hospitalized: Barbosa’s parents Frank and Carole, along with his sister Kathy, who is battling breast cancer.

Kathy, per Barbosa, is recovering and feeling better, despite contracting the virus while simultaneously undergoing chemo treatments. He says she went to the party and got infected, even though she was socially distanced outside on a porch."""

2020-06-26 13:18,"It is likely that what the headline describes is what is happening.  That's why the case rates are increasing, but the death rates, so far at least, are not.

The Times bears substantial responsibility for this. The Times published a series of editorials with titles like ""Protest is Patriotic"" and op-ed columns which encouraged many, mostly in the 20 to 40 year age range, to engage in mass protests over the murder of George Floyd. The editorials by and large did not mention masks, and ignored the ongoing pandemic. Though the motives for protest were understandable, the disregard for public health by the Times was irresponsible.

But the story is complex. Responding to the increasing case rates by reinstating strong lockdowns would be a very major mistake. Lockdowns that shut down our economy and global trade, scientific research, healthcare for non-covid cases, and all social activity are the wrong approach.

Instead, we need balance, with some degree of social distancing, and required use of masks in many situations.  

Only a vaccine will allow a return to normal, and we need to do everything we can to achieve one. This includes something that is anathema to many liberal-leaning readers of the Times: tort reform. In the past few days multibillion dollar verdicts against two major pharmaceutical firms have been upheld, threatening them with financial collapse.  If a vaccine is to be achieved, we need the efforts of drug companies. We need a vaccine more than lawsuits."

What does it mean that the country is experiencing its biggest surge yet and deaths are down? Is the virus mutating to less deadly? Is it because young people can handle it so much better? What does this mean for herd immunity?"
2020-06-26 13:27,"If you posit that people 40 and younger experience Covid as a severe cold that one gets over in 10 days and thereafter has immunity, then I think it becomes a difficult question whether the entire economy should be closed down. Maybe only the middle-aged and elderly should be social distancing?

From what little I know it is not certain that the disease produces immunity from future infection, and there may be ongoing lifelong ""aftereffects"" of having Covid. But it would be good to tell us more about what the evidence is for those aftereffects, and their anticipated severity.

The risk is never going to be zero.  Maybe we need to focus solely on the elderly or those with known pre-existing conditions that render COVID infection more deadly?"
2020-06-26 13:28,"""Younger people are making up a growing percentage of new coronavirus cases in cities and states where the virus is now surging""

Clearing the alarming issue is that this virus continues to change and evolve since it was first detected back in January.   At first, the most vulnerable group were seniors and individuals with serious heath issues, especially respiratory ones.  Now, six months later, younger people are making up the majority of the new cases.

Who knows what the next vulnerable group could be?

A friend of mine is a nurse practitioner and she has seen cases where some patients who had the virus have gotten it a second time and their symptoms have been worse than before.  That was certainly news to me.  I had not heard of anyone getting this virus a second time.

Because there is no vaccine in the very near future and because this virus continues to change and alter its path, perhaps the simplest action of wearing a mask and keeping a safe distance can slow down the spread of COVID-19.  

Let's face it, for now, we don't have anything else in our hip pocket.  Better these small actions be taken than NO preventative.  At least that's how my husband and I feel and we're members of the vintage group."

What does that have to do with anything? This a lethal and highly contagious virus, spread easily by people who are asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic. The only way we know to really stop the spread and to keep ourselves, our loved ones, and our communities safe is to stay the heck away from each other and wear masks. I am sure that this person knew that on some level, and yet she chose to go out anyway, and go out maskless, and is now trying to use the fact that they were told that they could as some sort of mitigating factor.

Just in general though, mortality rates have been lower for young folks, the economic and social impacts greater. They're making up their minds as the weather gets nicer, things open, etc..

If our contact-tracers tell people to stay home only if they develop symptoms, the contact tracing WILL FAIL.

From a May 1st article in the FT, ""Three fifths of new coronavirus cases in China show no symptoms"":
“There is very good evidence now that maximal shedding of [the virus] is from the pre-symptomatic phase of the infection. There is also strong mathematical modelling evidence that 40-80 per cent of transmission is from a- or pre-symptomatic individuals,” said Babak Javid, professor of medicine at Tsinghua University in Beijing. “As such, pre-symptomatic infection very much poses a contagion risk.”

Here's a review of evidence published on May 28th in the New England Journal of Medicine:

They don't wear masks, social distance, or worry about sanitizing.  They are pretty self-involved and don't really think outside their own box.  Our federal leadership has given them permission to ignore the Coronavirus except to denigrate it and say that it is going away.  These past few days have shown it that it is not.  My hair stylist yesterday wore no mask, had no concern for social distancing and did no sanitizing that I saw.  I will not be going back to her in six weeks.  She is fortyish and is the single parent of two young boys.  A friend of my daughter's who is also fortyish and lives in Florida says medical and scientific authorities are lying in order to spread panic and fear.  She believes none of it, yet works in a technical job for NASA and is highly educated.  You can't get much more scientific than that.  There are a number of plagues in America right now--the Coronavirus, racism, a collapsed economy--but none is more deadly than the doubt that has been sown by our own leadership in DC and in many GOP-led states.  It seems Trump and the GOP have adopted Covid19 to raise.  And we are all in danger for it."
2020-06-26 13:44,"This article is certainly concerning, but I want to stress some other factors it should have considered.

Young people are proportionally less wealthy than their older counterparts because of student loans, fewer years in the workforce, among others. Many of us HAVE to work to survive, even to support older family members who cannot work because of the virus. This makes us more susceptible to exposure. While going out is certainly a concern, the data you supply is conveniently linked to the idea that young people are spreading this virus because they want to party.

Many of us work service jobs. Many of us do not have the luxury of a home or shelter in which we can isolate ourselves from exposure; we have roommates, sometimes 4 or 5 depending on the location. Considering these factors might paint these swath of ""young people"" in a better light than this article."

You're making the situation worse through selected disinformation. Show the actual statistics (not just total cases and comparisons to other catastrophes) and continually update so people can make an informed decision. Sadly, we don't get this from the administration, the governors, the CDC and definitely not from the NYT. Instead, we talk about death rates larger than Vietnam. 7-9k Americans DIE EVERY DAY from something.

Even in grocery stores, they tended to be the only ones unmasked, once the mandatory order was undercut. It's been remarkable to watch, even in the last few days as we've turned into NYC, nothing has changed.  The media has told them they won't get sick, and that's all that matters.

Since things have started to reopen in these cities despite demonstrations cases still are falling 4 weeks on. There may be some innate immunity or cross reactivity to this/other viruses that explain low antibody prevalence (or the thresholds set on the antibody tests are too high and/or maybe more people have had it and antibodies fade with time leaving and adequate T-cell response to provide protection.)

When you review the cases distribution curves on the Johns Hopkins Covid Website places Florida, Oregon, Arizona and California never had a spike but a plateau of constant infections. 3-4 weeks after lockdowns were lifted it’s no surprise that the first wave in those regions persists with a massive spike as seen in London and New York as there is still ‘fuel to burn.’

Why are parts of Germany, South Korea and China going back into lockdown? They controlled cases efficiently but never got rid of the virus which they can’t. It’s still there and will still spread.

Either we lockdown permanently or open up and let it rip through (vulnerable to shield) and get this over with. This is sadly here to stay. I worry that places like Austrailia and New Zealand will suffer when they open their borders, that is unless we find an effective vaccine."

Nothing uniquely American about that attitude. It's prevalent here, too.

Yesterday, half a MILLION Brits descended on the relatively small, neighboring beach towns of Bournemouth and Poole on the south coast of England. We're having a bit of a heatwave here, right now. 500,000 people crammed  together on to two quite small beaches, drank excessively, fought over parking spaces (the city councils issued 1,000 parking tickets in one morning - a record) and general cosy'd up to each other, inches distant.

2020-06-26 13:42,"Can we dispel this notion that 20-40 can magically insulate themselves from this crisis? They may not be in the high risk crowd themselves, but they can be super-spreaders. I'd ask the below 40 crowd to consider your personal network of family, friends, and colleagues that you will inevitably come into contact with. You will undoubtedly find someone who is at considerably more risk than you are, and who 1) Is over age 60, 2) Has a pre-existing condition (~half of America has some form of pre-existing or chronic condition!), 3) Someone who has to work in a customer facing role, etc and all of the above. You may not suffer and/or die from it, but you may spread it to someone else who might.

At this point, the people still vilifying health officials and refusing to wear masks are doing it out of stubborn pride and/or inability to imagine they are wrong, have misled and harmed people, and have caused a majority of the country to actively hate them."

People are much more likely to wear masks in stores in states that require them.    Some of these governors are real hypocrites.  They reopen everything, case numbers rise, and then they scold young people for patronizing the very businesses that the state has allowed to reopen.    They scream “personal responsibility” from the rooftops, while taking no responsibility themselves.    New York and Chicago have shown that the coronavirus can be brought into check (for now, anyway), but it requires strong state and local action.    Blame the governors, not the young people."

*Everyone* above the age of toddler should be able to practice minimum precautions, without disrupting their life excessively, and this would greatly reduce infections. There's simply no excuse for going out without a mask. Form the habit of conversing from a bit more distance. If you MUST attend a party (I get it, I was young), stay outdoors, give people space, and keep your mask on except when you take a sip. I've observed families out walking with small kids wearing masks, it's not impossible."

They post black squares of Instagram, cancel people via Twitter, and vote for Ocasio-Cortez style candidates when they bother to vote. In NYC, Chicago, and other major cities, they’ve openly flouted restriction during the lockdown and during the phased reopening. It’s one of the many reasons it’s taken many months to drive the case counts down here. Far longer than in China and other Asian countries. Thousands more have died here than should have. 

The easy default of blaming Trump ignores the responsibility of local leaders and our fellow residents. DeBlasio and Cuomo were slow to order a lockdown in NYC when doctors and scientists were screaming about the need for one in early March. Stores were already selling out of cleaning wipes, bleach, and other essentials. But the truth is that many young New Yorkers wouldn’t have observed an earlier lockdown, they weren’t sufficiently scared. The large gatherings of young people we’ve seen over the past three months in NYC show that many still don’t care about spreading the virus."

Why is it ""disturbing""?  I can see it would be disturbing if a higher proportion of older people were getting the virus, but in fact, this report suggests that a \smaller/ proportion of older people are getting the virus."
2020-06-26 13:53,"To me there is a disturbing trend on Manhattan streets. Many people, mostly young women, seem to feel that ""wearing"" a mask means either having it around her neck or carrying it in her hand. Some, no mask period. Guys too by the way. This may not go well."
2020-06-26 13:59,"What`s difficult to understand?  We`re in a pandemic and until a vaccine is discovered and manufactured, masks and social distancing are de rigueur to stop the spread.  Since one can be asymptomatic while infected, we primarily wear masks to protect others, even if it protects us too.  Caring for our country and each other is part of citizenship. Without everyone taking these crucial steps, the spread is as obvious as 1+1 = 2."
2020-06-26 14:21,"Actually, we want young people to get the virus -- and live.  They become a shield for the old who will not survive.  Remember, we were not flattening the curve to avoid infections, we are flattening it to avoid deaths."

2020-06-26 13:48,"I'm waiting for the blame game to be shifted onto younger people, who you know, have been told to go out and work and shop for the economy.

The line oft parroted was: ""This only hurts a small number of people, most people should be able to go out and be fine.""

That thesis was presuming that ICUs wouldn't be overloaded. Somehow, magically through faith and economic (electoral) necessity we could get to a semblance of normalcy and just coexist with this virus as a population of 90% asymptomatic people.

That thesis was self-serving delusion. This didn't need to be a partisan 'epidemic'. Responding to a virus didn't need to be a negative for Trump or the GOP. Few people would have blamed him for a pandemic caused economic hardship, especially if he used it to unify the country.

But Conservatives cannot and will never attempt to unify the country. They only want to win big and take it all - so the only line of attack from their leadership was to ignore and downplay the severity."
2020-06-26 14:14,"Younger people are more likely to be asymptomatic and those with asymptomatic infections tend to be infectious for longer.  

If younger people are also ignoring social distancing and mask advice, then they will be exposing themselves to higher doses of the virus.  That translates into higher likelihoods of infections and worse outcomes as well."
2020-06-26 13:58,"We are dealing with two epidemics in the United States. The first one is very frightening. The case fatality rate for people over the age of 85 is about 15 percent.  About the same as yearly mortality for that age.  However, for teenagers and young adults through age 39, the case fatality rate is .2 percent.  Since the actual number of infections is ten times higher, the probability of death from COVID-19 if you are younger than 40 is .02 percent or 1 in 5000.  If you have no underlying health conditions the CDC estimates a young person's fatality rate from the disease is  .005 percent. or 20,000 to 1.

Are healthy teenagers and young adults willing to take a 20,000 to 1 risk to live as they were before COVID-19? Apparently they are, or at least many of them are."

2020-06-26 13:55,"The scary part of the virus for young people are the early studies out of China showing lung damage in young people who had coronavirus but were asymptomatic.  They didn't have symptoms because they weren't creating a significant immune response to the virus (which is partly what makes you feel lousy), but the virus was still doing what viruses do and damaging cells. People who rationalize going out to bars and in crowded places as ""I likely won't even have symptoms"" may rue these days several years down the line."
2020-06-26 13:54,"Young people  - more than grown ups -  don't like to obey rules. They are exploring the limits. That's nature.
Young people are less affected by the virus and without vaccine the pandemia is only over when most of the population has mastered the infection. That's nature as well.
The generation more at risk is wise enough to protect itself."
2020-06-26 14:14,"Physical proximity, indoor or outdoor, and length of time in an environment seem to be crucial. The grocery store seems risky but we're all so aware of space and what we touch, keep moving, and done in 20 min. A bar or party increases the time and proximity to others, touching each other, laughing and talking. Just one person in that room will spread it. In my neighborhood we've all started drinking (illegally) on the beach-- it's cheap, fun, and much safer with our small bubble of friends."
2020-06-26 14:32,"I’m just not sure what the goal is right now. Is the singular goal in the United States for no one to test positive for the corona virus? If so, then locking everyone in their houses makes sense. If that is not the only goal, then that is not the best policy. If young people are generally not being hospitalized and dying, then perhaps we can more specifically target vulnerable populations. During the height of the lockdown poor older people were working at grocery stores and hardware stores while young people quarantined at home and our homeless population grew. That makes no sense. It’s time to start being less myopic, accurately identifying all of our societal goals, and tailoring a policy that best achieves all of those goals."
2020-06-26 13:40,"Doesn't surprise me!  During the SIP, a coffee truck was allowed to reopen and do a pop up one Friday morning.  The owners made it very clear that if you visited the truck to please wear a mask to protect the workers (who are young people).  And there was even a sign on the truck asking customers to wear masks.  When I went to order some coffee there were two young women who ordered before me who were not wearing masks.  I assumed that they were friends from separate households and they weren't social distancing from one another either.  

We follow the protocols to not only protect ourselves but other people.  I don't understand the self-centered attitude of other people that makes them feel exempt from this."
2020-06-26 13:40,"I am confused. 

The headline should read ""younger people account for increased number of infections, health officials notice with relief"". - and the text should say: ""these numbers indicate that more vulnerable people take the disease serious and tend to follow a more stringent protocol of social distancing. This gives hope that the number of death will not skyrocket proportionally with the infection rate'."
2020-06-26 13:46,"As an actual young person (>22), the unemployment rate for people younger than 25 is hovering around 30 percent. Many of us work in sectors directly affected by COVID, and as a recent graduate, the job market is beyond horrific for us struggling to find something to step into. Youth and young adult depression and mental illness has skyrocketed.

We've tried to follow the guidelines, but there's just a fundamental fact that COVID does not affect nor is as severe for people my age. We cannot just stay inside, drink wine, and live off our non-existent savings like the boomers. We're being forced to stay inside, risk financial ruin, navigate a job market, and avoid our grandparents for a disease that many of us our finding out we may have already had.

Older, more vulnerable folks have to take extra precautions and stay more isolated because of these youngsters."

2020-06-26 14:43,"A lot of people seem to think that young people can’t help themselves. But while it is true that younger people are generally more likely to engage in risky behavior, I don’t believe this is inevitable. What is required here is clear direction and leadership so that people understand what they’re supposed to do and why they are doing it. Also, it would be enormously useful if young people would step up and own the issue. If young people would take the attitude that “it’s on us,” I think we could get much better conduct.

I don’t think it need be said to NYT readers but we are not helped by the negative leadership in the White House and much of the GOP.  But, this doesn’t mean that young people can’t exercise their own leadership."
2020-06-26 14:45,Possibly for younger Americans (<60) being infected by COVID may be equivalent to receiving a vaccine.

And then one night I went out and the next thing I know, I wake up in my bed, not remembering how I got home or how I got such horrible bruises on my right thigh.

It was then and there that I decided to stop drinking and going to bars.  

I find it incredible that something like this highly contagious and killer virus is still not a strong enough deterrent for young folks to not go out to bars and drink.

What will it take for people to realize that NO ONE is immune?  ANYONE can get this virus.  Is going out to a bar and drinking really worth that kind of risk?"

First, you do your homework, and find the most palatable of options.  Then present five options to them (at least one of them should be sustainable).  If masks get in the way of their Instagrams, please find alternatives.  

Second, figure out the socioemotional impact of your imposition.  Surely, masks and distancing will trigger stress.  Have medication and counseling services ready.  Ask taxpayers to fund these things.  

Third, make sure there are coaches in uniform everywhere they go; you can follow them in your car - ready to intervene and tell the coaches and referees if they are not performing up to your standard.  But careful now.  You don't want to be hurting their self esteem, or self-worth.  

Fourth, think through the rewards.  Try $100 each time they go near a mask, bonus of $50 for putting it on.  If it stays on for the day, heck, buy them a car.  I mean the sacrifice they are making.

Fifth. And pay attention here because this is very important.  Have you asked them how they feel?  What they think about the virus?  Maybe doctors and scientists say that coronavirus is real.  But, what do they know.  Please pay attention to your genius; s/he knows pretty much everything.

Several Democrat governors and other political leaders aligned with the social disruption movement have supported and marched along side these merry bands of elite malcontents, thus signifying that they are virus free and represent no danger to the population in any manner, particularly Speaker Pelosi and Senator Schumer who even donned colorful masks in support of spontaneously enlightened hordes.

Meanwhile, for the rest, the 99 percent uninfected and uninspired, remain sheltered in place with mask permanently affixed in fear of family and friends as this pandemic panic is now weaponized and soon in full effect driven by media and the mindless.

Fortunately my parents have mostly come around and are taking this seriously but the unmasked crowds outside restaurants in my neighborhood indicate that  people of all ages are letting their guard down.

Why? 

Because we can visualize getting bitten by a shark, and losing a body part or worse.

Ok, suppose I tell you the coronavirus is the thing looking for food (sustenance) and YOU are that sustenance, because once it gets into your cells, it uses them to reproduce, and it may kill those cells in the process.  The result is you get sick, or worse.

Regardless of the reopening orders, if you’re still going to bars while this pandemic is rampaging and while America is far from reducing the number of cases close to zero (I doubt this will ever happen), going to the crowded area without a mask means you’re not doing the best you can.

I often think of the war efforts required of Americans in WWII. trump supporters of today would howl at curfews, gather to shine their cars' headlights en masse at night to 'liberate' citizens from blackout orders. They'd hoot at Civil Patrols as 'tyrannical government', and openly fly the Nazi (confederate) flag, talking about Antifa terrorists, which included our own ""antifascist"" war effort.

Maybe they'd throw scrap metal and tires into the river to protest being told it's materiel for troops. They also might accuse soldiers of selling their (PPE) bullets 'out the back door' when those troops beg for ammo on the front lines.

We don’t yet know whether people who showed only minor or moderate symptoms have sustained permanent damage. Permanent lung damage looks like a good possibility.  Other organs – heart, kidneys – have been harmed in some cases. 

Now consider that a few viruses have a history of “going underground” in the body and then causing illness years later: chicken pox (herpes) reappearing as shingles or hepatitis B triggering liver cancer. It will be a while before we know whether this is in Covid-19’s box of tricks.

What does this add up to? In insurance terms: preexisting condition. 

Meanwhile … Texas’s Solicitor General, joined by Republican officials in 17 other states and the Trump administration, is arguing that the U.S. Supreme Court should strike down the Affordable Care Act. This act stops insurance companies from denying coverage to people with preexisting conditions. 

Let’s assume insurance companies will be clever enough to ask applicants whether they had Covid-19. If Texas’s SG & Co. prevail, insurance companies will be able to deny coverage outright. And don’t count on lying on the form – the old system allowed insurers to cancel coverage back to the beginning of the contract and refund the premiums paid. Cold comfort to someone facing cancer or an organ transplant.

Think carefully before you act. The old person’s life you put at risk may be your own."

I see not just a confusion in our government's response, but confusion within the medical community; that is, ""the experts"".  Or maybe these journalist are just confused.

One thing that is not confusing is that you are better off to stay isolated to the extent your job and your existence can allow it.  When you must go out, put on your PPE and social distance.

So while bars and beaches are definitely a problem, I don’t think it’s fair to assume all young people are just out partying. On another note, in my neck of the woods the young people are the ones who are actually FOLLOWING the rules. I’m in my 40’s and I wear a mask anytime I have to go out (which I avoid as much as I can). But in my town it’s the middle aged “don’t tell me my rights” good-old-boys who are not wearing masks and not social distancing. I went to the auto parts store the other day and the ONLY employee wearing a mask was the young kid in his 20’s. And I see the same thing with customers at Home Depot. All the people under 40 are wearing masks, and all the people over 60 are wearing masks. It’s the people in between who don’t seem to care. I was in the paint section and the guy in front of me asked the employee at the counter “they seriously make you wear a mask all day??” Then this customer went on to brag about how he “never wears a mask” because they “don’t do anything anyway” and the numbers are “all made up” it’s “his right” to do whatever he wants.

Young people are very poor at social distancing and other mitigation measures.  We already knew that before COVID-19.  Mix in a absolutely-must-do protest and a national policy of throwing as much junk science in the air as possible because of a criminally irresponsible president, and very poor goes to can't do it at all.

Our area went to phase 1 a week and a half ago.  Last weekend, we happened to go to a place to purchase something that was across the street from a bar.  They were ""pretending"" to do phase 1, all the drinking was outdoors, all the tables were spaced apart.  But the young people were having a very pre-COVID happy hour with no masks and people congregating and meeting each other and drinking and carrrying on.

It is mind boggling to me that we have become so selfish, so self-centered that we cannot do what is best for our country, for our fellow citizens.

Of course it won’t be handled that way as it was during WWII, when nary a tire, much less a car, came on the market and you had stamps to buy household goods. As unemployment figures suggest “wants” venues comprise 20% of the US economy if suppliers are counted, Imperial Valley farmworkers harvested lettuce dumped to rot because it’d been on contract to a shuttered restaurant chain.

We’re creative enough to ask, “Is this important enough to bet Auntie’s hospital bed on?” Even missing a cure, hospitals greatly improve survival in distress after infection.

We, as parents, are trying to balance the community health needs against the individual mental health needs of our children. Our kids got kicked out of their schools and care facilities; lost access to playgrounds and other family friendly spaces; and now we're watching as adult spaces (like bars) are made safe while kids still have no place to go.  The natural outcome is that many families are looking for social interaction for their kids and a little relief from the stresses of being home full time without support.  My guess is that way more of the spread is happening because parents who are being required to return to work are also trying to find ways for their kids to have some level of normal social engagement, not because people are flocking back to bars."
2020-06-26 15:24,"Worrying excessively about the large  number of younger folks getting infected is taking a very short term view of the situation. Rather, it is likely that this large number of younger folks getting infected will provide longer term benefits. Studies to date indicate that infection provides at least short term protection from reinfection. Based on other coronaviruses, this will likely last for at least a couple years. Hence, these younger infections today will help reduce the spread of the disease next year since you are removing a large number of transmission vectors from the population."
2020-06-26 15:11,"What do you expect? The virus is not going away without either a vaccine or herd immunity and we have no idea when or even if those things will arrive. No amount of social distancing can eradicate the virus fully. The realistic goal is to avoid overwhelming the healthcare system.

 It makes total sense that people who are at little personal risk from the virus are going to resume some semblance of a normal life. Of course people should wear masks in public and be conscientious of personal space and hand washing, but you're saying I should hide in my house indefinitely to avoid something that poses little threat to me?

Although there is no one means of prevention as we do not have a vaccine at this time, we do know that masks, social distancing and good hygiene decrease the transmission.   These need to be accepted as universal precautions for COVID19 at this time.  Everyone must be made to wear a mask and/or social distance until there is a vaccine.  This is not a political issue.  This is a public health issue.  Mayor deBlasio needs to enforce mask use and social distancing.  People are already letting down their guard."

At the same time, I think it's completely irresponsible and disgusting that our state's leadership (and very subtly, this article as well)  is now pointing the finger at youth and ultimately blaming them for what's happening.  It was the state governor who stripped Texas county/city  governments' capability to extend and enforce shelter in place order and masking orders (Houston's county judge attempted to mandate a masking order over a month ago!)  that could have prevented this. State leaders have been asking Texans to take ""personal responsibility"" in mitigating this COVID crisis.  But what about their responsibility as leaders?   The discretion of knowing who to listen to, the strength to make hard decisions for the greater good, ability to provide  clear and comprehensive messaging -- all these were the responsibilities of leaders, and all of which they completely failed to do. To put it simply -- they opened bars and restaurants, parks and beaches. What did they think would happen?

Upon our very fraught return - he had to drop everything, leave his place over there with one bag in hand - we had to quarantine for 14 days per the authorities. 

We’d already been on modified, then full, lockdown in the U.K. Since March 14.

So, what did most of my son’s “friends” in Utah have to say to him when he would not go out to hang with them upon his return?  They called him paranoid, over reacting, told him there are mental issues he needs to deal with, etc. 

One friend got that we had witnessed the virus ravage Italy and Spain and jump to the U.K., where it has killed 20 people in a care home a block from my son’s house there. 

Fast forward - Utah has totally failed to deal with this when it had a real chance. Selfish young people and crazed political zealots are spreading this thing around at an alarming rate and younger and younger people are getting it and spreading it to their vulnerable family members and neighbors.

This morning, my son said to me, “Did you ever think we’d get away from that situation over there (in Liverpool), only for it to be more dangerous here now?”

It seems that we are painted in a corner: we can either lock down the economy and deal with the deleterious effects of a shutdown economy and allow everyone to receive the maximum end of life care that the current medical system can provide, or ration healthcare and let life go on.  Do we sacrifice the economy in order to not overwhelm the medical system with citizens who are going to die on average within the next 6-13 months with or without COVID?   

To prove the irrationality of not opening schools: 5 citizens from 5-17 years have died in MN/WI/IL/IN/OH/PA/NJ/MA/VA/

2020-06-26 14:27,USA reports don’t mention tracing - tracking contacts of COVID-19 victims.   Are there really billions in funds for this being held by Trump?
2020-06-26 14:50,"So massive gatherings, like protests, might not have been a good idea? Who knew?"
2020-06-26 16:17,"To those who criticize the protestors: 

The science of the virus tells us that transmission risk is considerably lower if you are outdoors, moving, spaced apart, and wearing a mask, as the vast majority of protestors are.

The science of the virus tells us transmission risks rise considerably indoors, staying close to the same people for 15 minutes or more, and not wearing a mask, as the vast majority of bar, party, and restaurant goers are. 

The moral imperative of peaceful protestors who demand social justice, democracy for all, and an end to police brutality is strong. They are fighting—and risking—to better society and the lives of others. 

The moral imperative of those going to bars, parties, and restaurants is nonexistent. Their motives are selfish and shortsighted. 

There is no equivalency between the actions of these two groups. Stop pretending to justify your and their selfishness."
2020-06-26 14:56,"Before we blame these 20-somethings...notice how many kids 3-15 years old, go into stores without a mask.  Then home to cuddle with their elderly relative.  That is the more likely cause."
2020-06-26 15:02,"I have a hard time imagining that in my 20s I would have felt so ""invincible"" as to be reckless and endanger others. I'm 35 now. I just don't buy this whole ""young people"" talk. Young people can also be caring and selfless, but many here in the US, they are usually spoiled brats. (I'm not from the US originally)."
2020-06-26 15:45,"This is not news. This is 24 hour 'news'.

Let me rewrite the article: cases are up, the virus is spreading. Done.

""Experts cautioned that the seemingly new prevalence among young people may be, in part, a reflection of more widely available testing.""

Has the number of young people hospitalized as a share of the total changed? If not, this just means, the virus has spread."
2020-06-26 15:17,"Until U.S. society is ready to mandate and enforce some basic Covid restrictions, like wearing masks and distancing, its time to stop being surprised that bad things are happening . Threats, warnings,  etc. don't seem to be enough to convince the ignorant and careless to take personal and social responsibility for their actions.

Trump puts it in economic terms. What is a life worth? Why take the risk of infecting yourself and/or somebody else? What is the long term cost of losing over 100,000 lives? To put it simply, the cost of losing all these lives and the medical care for those infected doesn't balance vs. the cost of a mask. 

Why is it so hard to accept? The time for these mandates to start was several months ago but its not too late to begin. Masking and distancing should be mandated and enforced. Its not a matter of personal freedoms except for the freedom to infect others. Masking and distancing make common and economic sense."
2020-06-26 15:42,"Surprise, surprise !! Every medical/epidemiological expert was predicting this exactly. In the rush to open the economy without strict mandatory guidelines, the Republican governors are mostly responsible for the resurgence of the pandemic and the likelihood of the economy crashing again in the next few weeks. Young people got the message “we’re open for business”. The other person responsible is Trump. He has politicized wearing masks, ridiculed testing and snubs his nose at his experts by holding highly dangerous rallies. As a physician, I have never seen such disregard for human life as we are witnessing now. The Republican Party’s silence has enabled Trump to continue to denigrate our health and the office of the President."
2020-06-26 14:07,"Sure, wear a mask when in lines, in a store, bank, post office, etc.  This is manditory anyway in the Bay Area.  But I'm perplexed and a bit fed up with the ""kabuki theater"" types around here - an area with single family homes, wide streets, etc. where one can easily distance as one passes whilst taking exercise - where (usually women) piously pull up a mask when I pass them for a fleeting 2 seconds at a distance of 6 feet or more because, well, what?  They are so infected that they will infect me?  Or I will infect them (though we're constantly told your own mask doesn't protect you, it protects others so....?)  It is performative""virtue signalling"" and it's getting old.  Be safe but be sensible.  Contact tracers in Germany use a duration of contact of 15 minutes for heaven's sake!  Not 2 seconds!  It's too stressful to see coronavirus in every situation one encounters without somehow filtering first through the facts.  At least the facts as we know them.  I realize this is every evolving.  In a way, the constant photo of beachgoers in these articles in the NYT is misleading.  One is less likely to contract Covid-19 in the open air, with a beach breeze and keeping a distance.  A more illustrative photo would be people in a bar."

2020-06-26 14:44,"I have some advice for the young and (seemingly) invincible. You don't want to catch this. My nephew, a young, tough 26-year old caught it at his work and said it is the most painful thing he has ever gone through. He's better now, thank God, but even if you don't give it to someone else and kill them, you could endure 10 days of intense misery."
2020-06-26 16:07,Why are they going out and not wearing a mask? Because they don’t know anyone that got sick. And that is my problem with this virus too. I don’t know anyone that has been sick from this. I know plenty of people that tested positive though. Perhaps the virus has mutated into something less lethal.
2020-06-26 16:29,"I am sure this is true, and as a thirty something it is definitely concerning. However, when ""statistics"" like this one are bandied about (""In Florida, which breaks records for new cases nearly every day, the median age of residents testing positive for the virus has dropped to 35, down from 65 in March,"" it erodes the integrity of the argument.  That's an apples to orangutans comparison. In March, tests were so limited that of course, the confirmed cases were skewed towards the most vulnerable populations, because they were the only people getting tested.  I am confident that the real story is that young people are putting themselves in a vulnerable position and it's showing now, but it wasn't any less of an issue then.  The severe under testing in this country has endangered everyone by minimizing the threats to all communities."
2020-06-26 16:15,"To too great an extent we are an undisciplined nation, addicted to personal “needs,” justified by a distorted view of freedom. Lip service is regularly given to serving the common good, but substantive doing to that end, regarded in final analysis as unnecessarily inconvenient, is woefully lacking. Why, for the most part if not entirely, is the rest of the world doing far better than we with COVID-19? And we are so “exceptional!” The lie vested in denial has caught up with us. And with a president and vice president like the ones we have, the matter is made worse, as the data ... consider the 40,000 NEW cases yesterday ... show."
2020-06-26 16:25,"While there may be no upside to this story the fact that perhaps 30,000,000 Americans may be infected with COVID-19 indicates we are stumbling forward into a herd immunity. Asymptomatic people are walking around like Typhoid Mary spreading this disease without a care for others. Its when they infect their parents, grandparents, infants, and those with co-morbidities and something serious happens will they realize their folly. Those who disregard history are bound to repeat previous mistakes Those making statements regarding mask use undermining their freedoms are showing lack of regard for the freedom of others who comply with health dept and CDC recommendations. Those who think that God will protect them ignore the fact that viruses are agnostic to your God. Viruses attack with extreme prejudice and impunity regardless of race, color, creed, or religion."
2020-06-26 16:10,"Can only speak for myself and what I've observed, so my 2 cents probably isn't even worth that. There's a private university in my neighborhood. Expensive one. I've been walking the streets with my wife since this SIP started. Doing the whole 'social distancing' thing. We've seen these kids partying at their frat houses pretty much from the outset of SIP.  At first, there weren't many kids because the university closed. A lot more have been showing up lately, probably for 'virtual' graduation ? So yeah, can certainly see why there would be a jump in infections in young people."
2020-06-26 15:38,Another disturbing aspect of the spread of the virus among young people is that the full and long-term effects of the virus remain unknown. A vast uncontrolled experiment is taking place. I don't think an alien intelligence considering the human race would conclude it is rational.
2020-06-26 16:04,I'll probably get some negative responses for saying this but the virus will continue to be reported as getting worse up till election day.  If Biden should win it will magically disappear in the headlines and if Trump should win they will say the virus disenfranchised voters from showing up at the polls.   When the media and elected officials neglected to even mention the protesters lack of effort to protect against the  spread they can't expect the general public to believe them anymore.  I certainly do not!
2020-06-26 15:48,I would have been surprised and questioned our health experts had the tens of thousands in the streets protesting did not result in a spike.

2020-06-26 14:17,"Backwards thinking. Those at the least risk should be deliberately infected via an immune-enhancing system. A dose or two of convolescent plasma from a recovered patient, then a single digits dose of virus along with convolescent plasma, then a double digits dose along with, then a triple digit dose along with, until the isolated low risk person is immune. Then the newly minted almost zero risk person gets back to life"

Everyone I know in this age group are socializing again Myself incluided -- and we're NOT being selfish or self-absorbed. We're being cautious and testing the waters for everyone else. Permanent isolation is NOT sustainable -- but outdoors, with masks, and maintaining relative physical distance. And guess what? It's working. There is an exit strategy. Spread it and hold your state/city accountable.included"
2020-06-26 15:12,"So, a nation divided by race, gender and income inequality now gets to add age to the list. It seems the US is now destined for a vast reservoir of future lethal infections asymptomatically resident in the 187 million people under 45, a population majority. That leaves the minority that’s most vulnerable — 35 million people over 65 — as permanent hostages of the majority. But the minority has, on average, about four times the majority’s net worth. The majority, on the other hand, therefore stands to benefit from the largest intergenerational transfer of wealth in human history on the death of the minority. This is going to be interesting as the invisible — and usually unconscious — hand of self-interest comes into play. Meanwhile, judging from what the story suggests, the most dangerous transmission vector now seems to be flies, um, bar flies."
2020-06-26 14:07,"I think it's important for the NY Times to continue to stoke the ""us versus them"" mentality during this crisis.  Look how constructive it's been!  

Read any European paper, and it's the same thing there as it is here, and the same as it's always been.  People on planes.  People on cruises.  People in bars and restaurants.  People in churches.  People in nursing homes.  It's almost like there's something in common in all these situations.

Note that you can discuss 1) confined interior spaces, 2) close contact with others in those spaces, 3) long durations of that contact, and 4) poor sanitation of those spaces without making assumptions about age, race, religion, political party, etc."
2020-06-26 14:36,"There are conflicts of interest muddying the waters. Ideally we would separate the need for income from the need to SIP, but it's difficult and costly to implement. I believe most of the anti-mask people are really saying they're desperate for an income.

The states need to stop expecting Trump to lead. The president is desperate to win an election, creating another conflict of interest. States are on their own. Let's accept this and move on. We're wasting time by focusing on Trump."
2020-06-26 14:55,"Young people may not get sick, may not think they will get infected and spread the virus, and overall, may not think this will affect them, but it will affect them, as the economy continues to waiver.  If you can't ""do it"" out of compassion for others, at least do it for the money!"
2020-06-26 15:50,"Probably worth remembering that much of this demographic are the people being forced back to work prematurely. It's not just about going out to bars, although that is certainly a factor."

with the passionate pleas of the young.

It is bad enough they spend the Summer trying

I would ask them to keep quarantine,

2020-06-26 16:19,"This is how young people always are, always have been.  They are more likely to take risks and think bad things won't happen.  It's why people sign up for the military when they're 18, not 38.  It's why college kids are so irresponsible with drinking.  It's why high schoolers will confidently tell friends and relatives that, no, drugs really aren't all that bad.

Instead of villifying 20-somethings--most of us were once like that!-we need real leadership, actual rules (not recommendations), and ways to enforce them legally or via social stigma. 

Releasing weak guidelines and expecting young people are going act like they grasp real risk, is a losing idea."
2020-06-26 15:43,"People of all ages may wear masks or not, socially distance or not.  This grand experiment of keeping people safe by limiting social interactions in a social species goes better in some countries than others.  Our independent ""you can't tell me what to do"" streak and our weighing of risks that don't include heavy fines or jail time will increase the financial and emotional costs of coronavirus AND delay economic recovery that depends on people of all ages feeling safe to go to stores and restaurants.

Each selfish act potentially hurts us all.  How long will people's savings hold out while the economy continues to tank?  Will my 93 year old mom who has respiratory problems stay safe?  

Every time I encounter someone who isn't wearing a mask or socially distancing, I cringe.  We're all in this together, and the danger is real.  Today, wearing a mask anywhere in the state of Washington became mandatory.  How many people will still refuse, will threaten the poor store or restaurant employee who tries to enforce it?  Selfishness..."
2020-06-26 16:49,"Wait - isn't this what we hoped would happen? We slowed the initial spread to allow time for supplies/hospitals to catch up (they did), and now the virus is making its way through the populace (which it is going to do regardless, just over time). And now, younger folks who are less affected by it are catching it - many (most?) of whom don't experience dramatic symptoms. I am a fan of masks and physical distancing, but the moving goalposts on this (are we trying to SLOW the spread, or STOP it?) and the overreaction to every number from the media is exactly what has caused so many to be dismissive. How about we isolate those we KNOW are at risk (65+, underlying health issues), and the rest of us do the best we can? All this blame and hyperbole is possibly the largest contributor to where we are right now (both politically and epidemiologically). Yes, it's bad. But it's a fact of life now. As hard as we want to believe otherwise, every once in a while the world likes to show us we're not as in control or insulated as we think we are."
2020-06-26 16:51,"What a want or need is depends on point of view. For example, there are those who consider college football to be more essential than having students in classrooms."
2020-06-26 16:52,"While younger people who are infected with the virus are less likely to be hospitalized and less likely to die, they do face a grave danger which most people overlook. Young people are at least as likely and perhaps more likely to contract a long- term, post viral syndrome such as Chronic Fatigue Syndrome/Myalgic  Encephalomyelitis. I have been suffering from just such a disease since before the pandemic and it has left me unable to hold a job and tied me to my bed for most of the day. Although there are some doctors and medical researchers who working hard to understand this illness (such as The Open Medicine Foundation) it amazes me how most doctors are unwilling to take the condition seriously."
2020-06-26 12:48,"So here's a legal theory: if a thirty-something chooses to hang out in crowds maskless, knowing (from the vast amount of public information) that it creates a non-negligible risk that this activity could spread coronavirus, and then the thirty-something gets infected and unknowingly spreads it to a more vulnerable person who dies from COVID-19, that thirty-something can be prosecuted for reckless homicide, which is defined as engaging in an action despite knowing that it risks serious harm or death to another, which then occurs.  Reckless homicide is state law so state and local prosecutors would have jurisdiction for such cases.  And since local prosecutors are not bound by DOJ's policy of not indicting a sitting president, one could even see an argument that if the thirty-something went maskless because he or she followed the example and the messaging of the President that discourages mask wearing, the President is likewise guilty of homicide because he too was reckless, knowing others would follow his lead and therefore be likely to spread the virus.  If the thirty=something cooperated in the investigation and admitted that the reason for the maskless behavior was to follow Trump's lead, there would be a direct link in the chain of proof to establish such a case.  The current widening spread is horrible and unfair, and sooner or later, some people ought to be held accountable for making it worse through recklessness."

We elected a catastrophy. We are now living in a catastrophy. We are a catastrophy. The experts are wrong. There is no escape. We are in this for the long haul. The sullen crawling of our own length along. We can blame him but we must blame ourselves. What we bought were his haunting hatreds because they are us.

No evidence suggests we can emerge from a pandemic unscathed, we cannot emerge at all.

Casandra says we cannot change either our behavior or the systems that keep the rich alive. Pandora is right behind her. The box has been opened and making the convenient assumption that we have put the genii back in the bottle is called a lack of leadership.

Hollywood has always told us assault will come from bombs and guns. Even dystopia suggests benign authority will save us.

Nothing will.

Not authority or leadership. These are cultural illusions. We can't prepare for the now. We are unable to prepare for the final act. We laugh at the past. People who spout statistics do not know what will happen next.

I’ve talked to many, including two of my very intelligent kids in their 40s, who feel as if since they are “healthy” it’s not that important to use the recommended protections to protect others, we should just stay in.  I have heard this repeatedly.  I guess we older adults, with or without health issues are no more to them than impediments to their ability to socialize.

It’s generally the older generation that is supporting a president who does not wear a mask and a political party that does not want to provide financial assistance to allow people to stay home and be safe during this time. There are comments in this section about how younger people are more progressive/liberal and that they are the ones causing the surges, yet this is happening in conservative states. This continued divisiveness is why America has no clear path to eradicate the virus. We have no guidance from the top, local governments are sending confusing and contradicting statements, and conspiracy theorists are fueling political motivated agendas but somehow this has boiled down to “blame Millenials”."

You get young people marching around, hanging out with their friends/strangers believing they are doing something worthy. It is exciting and stimulating.  Even if you wear a mask during the protest, afterwards you go to 'unwind' at a bar or on the streets with other friends, you take off the mask, you drink, feel inviolable, and there is the spread. Without the push to protest that has been the focal point of this newspaper and most news services, we may have seen lower overall case numbers.

2020-06-26 16:47,"Clearly news reports in the Times and throughout the media have misled.  For months we're heard about most people having no symptoms or very mild ones from this virus.  Young people, we were told, seldom get sick or even have symptoms.  A wiser statement would have been that we don't know yet if some escape the worst or even getting sick, it's too early to know.  Those reports fed the sense of invulnerability that those of an adolescent mind have about themselves and about their friends.  The summer season now upon us will prove those reports to be premature."
2020-06-26 16:47,"I will not excuse ""younger"" people in  their 20s, 30s, and 40s for their reckless behavior endangering others.

When those of us a bit older, when we were in our 20's and higher, there was no catastrophic global pandemic like Covid19 that has killed people worldwide, that has dominated our news, that has disrupted our lives, that has decimated our labor market, that has put small businesses out of business, that has resulted in the federal government giving out billions of dollars out almost randomly and has changed our lives, our world for who knows how long.

Unless, they live under a rock or were on the moon on a mission for the last six months, they have to be aware of the threat  but just don't care about others.  I really have no understanding of nor acceptance of reckless 20, 30, 40 and 50 yr olds' behavior who walk around nonchalantly without wearing masks potentially infecting others.

Not to mention that they also most likely happen to have parents, grandparents, siblings, friends, co-workers (if not now, soon), neighbors and go into restaurants, bars, and stores and want others to serve them, and don't forget health care workers and delivery people and so on. 

Basically, it's a unique time. No excuses regardless of age.  The media has on occasion shown children, little ones,  saying responsible things about the pandemic that would put their ""elders"" to shame."
2020-06-26 17:17,"It really is time to start taking Covid-19 seriously. If we continue our current behavior, we will eventually end up with deaths in the six figures or higher. This is not necessary. We need to take masks and distancing seriously. Right now, politicians seemed to have made a choice for the economy over lives. It is a false choice. We need to be tougher on violations of distancing, masks, and social gathering. Politicians that want the economy opened need to make it clear they will make it as safe as possible. Require masks and distancing. Failure to meet these requirements should result in a fine for the first offense. A second offense should result in some short jail time in a safe situation like an isolated tent in a sport stadium. We all want to save the economy and have fewer deaths. Take Covid-19 seriously and make failure by individuals to work towards reducing its effects have consequences. President Trump, your numbers are in free fall. Even you might get a boost if you reversed course, listened to your health advisors, and acted to reduce the spread of Covid-19. One can only hope and vote in November."

""Is it the governor’s reopening? Is it Memorial Day? Is it the George Floyd demonstrations? Is it going to the beach?” said Eric Boerwinkle, dean of the UTHealth School of Public Health in Houston. “We don’t really know, but it is probably all of those things that are contributing.”

Well, all we have to do is ASK when we test!!! Did you go to the beach, did you go to a protest, have you eaten indoors or outdoors at restaurants or gone to crowded bars, do you wear a mask, do you social distance? Ask the questions, compile and statistically analyze the information, and we can learn a vast amount about this disease and its spread, and then put a hard stop on the behavior that is most conducive to it.

Of course, national coordination and guidance could readily cause the uniform nationwide collection and analysis of the information. But instead we just have to guess and wonder. Or for those in a position at the top to really do something, ""see no evil, hear no evil, speak no evil."" 

It's pathetic how we are now seeing in the new spread states the exact same types of stresses on the healthcare system as we saw in the east in March and April. We learn nothing, even when it's staring us in the face. It's been a long time coming, it's going to be a long time before the dawn."

They started out by saying that older people were more at risk.  That's because nursing homes had the highest rate of infection that we learned about early on.  Then OUR CDC did not require masks because ""there was a shortage"".  Now we have learned that the virus has no ""age"" preference and are learning how many ways the virus attacks bodies of every age, race, religion and political leaning.  Mother Nature does not discriminate.

I am FURIOUS.  I have taken all precautions since I learned about this deadly plague-like pandemic because I have an underlying immune disorder.  Now because of the incredibly selfish/stupid actions of others I may have to end my life in isolation.  

OUR country should have been shut down immediately so OUR leaders could get on top of this.  We should have shared information with China and other countries who knew how to handle pandemics.  Instead The Con Don and his Robber Baron brethren have squelched information and the assistance to states that WE THE PEOPLE pay them to handle and pretend the virus is not important.

I am starting to believe that we are being put in such danger because OUR medical complex is owned/controlled by the 0.01% International Mafia Robber Barons who are making extraordinary profit from this plague.

2020-06-26 17:41,"The CDC estimates that from October 1, 2019 to April 4, 2020 up to 740,000 people have been hospitalized and up to 62,000 people have died from the flu in the U.S.  They also estimate up to 56 million flu illnesses in the U.S. during that same time period.  So why aren't we forced to social distance and wear masks every flu season to prevent susceptible people from dying from the flu?  Are those 62,000 deaths somehow less important than the deaths caused by COVID-19?  Flu deaths don't even make the news.

How deadly must a virus be before we shut society down and force social distancing and mask wearing?  Obviously, a virus as deadly as the flu doesn't do it.  COVID-19 they say is something like 10 times as deadly as the flu and we've shut the world down for that, so is it a disease that is something like 5 times as deadly as the flu that triggers preventative measures and shutdowns?  Or do we have to get to something like 8 or 9 times as deadly as the flu to do anything about it? 

Young people aren't very susceptible to either the flu or COVID-19.  Yet we don't come down on them during flu season for going out and living their lives.  I guess 62,000 deaths just isn't enough for society to care.

Younger folks don't get sick enough from getting the virus to go to the hospital, when compared to older folks who do. Since younger folks aren't getting sick nearly as much as older folks, and since kids are kids, they're not following CDC, WHO, State Health Department, NIH, Johns Hopkins, and other universally-accepted scientifically proven recommendations to wear masks and socially distance themselves.

Some of the language here is ambiguous, and suggests the latter might be a purpose of mask usage. This is important as many folks believe masks are an intrusion on their own right to become infected, and not understanding the masks are there to protect others’ right to live. This purpose has to be driven in to people’s minds constantly until this understanding is second nature."
2020-06-26 20:59,"I think a big detail that this piece overlooks is the amount of younger people that have had to go back to work as the states reopen. It's tempting to blame the entirety of the spike on young people going out to party at bars and restaurants, but the average age of the servers and bartenders waiting on those customers is also under 30, according to nationwide averages from 2018, with over 200k servers and bartenders under the age of 25. We need to acknowledge that while many are choosing to be out and about, that is only possible when states have decided to prioritize the economy over the health of the workers and customers that will want or have to be there. There are definitely a lot of young people making ill advised choices right now, but I'm a little over the 'Millenials killed the flattened curve' rhetoric."
2020-06-26 21:43,"I think a better explanation of the numbers would help.  For example if 10 are found positive after testing 100 that is 10%.  If the testing increased to 100,000 and 10,000 are found positive it is still 10%.  More testing just gives a better picture of who is potentially infected. 
If the idea of self-quarantine should be explained for those who don't show symptoms.  Most people would be more concerned if the number hospitalized or the number of deaths went up a lot.
Most people don't know anyone who died or was hospitalized with Covid-19 so it doesn't seem real."
2020-06-26 21:42,"“Our best estimate right now is that for every case that was reported, there actually were 10 other infections,” according to Dr. Robert Redfield.

Sooner or later just about everyone is going to be exposed to Covid-19. The demographic for those susceptible to serious consequences of that exposure are now well documented. Obesity and Type 2 diabetes, which is directly related to obesity are the largest cohort. Rather than condemning those that choose to live their lives, perhaps it's time to demand that the obese take responsibility for their own welfare and alter their lifestyle."

In March and early April many cases were never identified; so they were never counted. Now a greater percentage of cases are being identified and counted; so it makes things look worse.

A better metric would be to look at the daily death rate which has dropped by 67% since mid April while the daily infection rate has dropped by less than 30%."

2020-06-25 12:41,"The United States, thanks to Trump and red state governors, is doing the worst.  What a waste of precious lives due to selfishness and partisanship.

Savannah’s mayor is going to mandate mask wearing after a recent surge here.  There were about 100,000 people on tiny Tybee Island on Memorial Day weekend, and summer beach numbers are much higher than resident numbers.

The city attorney is working with the mayor but Kemp’s declaration said municipalities cannot have stricter rules than his (which are non-existent).  Georgia has consistently lied about its numbers. Even so, local numbers have doubled in the last few days.

At least we are spared one of those Republican death rallies since they chose Jacksonville for the RNC."
2020-06-25 13:22,"The TX governor's claim that increased cases are the result of more testing is a lie. I live here, and people are actually getting tested less because they have to work anyway. There is no mask requirement and businesses hosting large crowds are open. It's not easy to get a test. Most test centers require a referral or symptoms. Even when we can, the results take a long time and it's hard to get them. 

My wife, friend, and I took tests and never received our results. And now that the case numbers are exploding, Greg Abbott is doing nothing and just blaming us. It's his fault he reopened too fast. It's all about money. Now that it is obvious we should close down again, he is still doing nothing. Many more people will die. My wife works at a hospital in Harris County. Their ICU is near capacity. We will soon be another Brooklyn."
2020-06-25 13:21,"The trading of assertions about what the (reported) data means is completely unhelpful. Until the US as a single nation institutes widespread testing (including those without symptoms) and contact tracing, all the reported data will be at best lagging what’s really happening and at worst useless.

It pretty much summarises our impression of the current situation in the US. I feel so terribly sorry for the many affected by Covid-19 with respect to illness, loss of work and - of course - death. Most of all, it appears completely meaningless that the problems have accelerated so much, far worse than in most other countries.

It's hard to predict where and when a hurricane will make landfall, and how strong it will be. But everyone knows that there will heavy rainfall and high winds in the affected area.

The same thing applies to a pandemic. It is hard to predict how fast it will spread and how lethal it will be. But by now everyone should know that without physical distancing measures and contact tracing hundreds of thousands will get infected and tens of thousands will die.

But the anti-science party clearly believes that the virus and be wished or prayed away. And the GOP 's failure in this crisis won't make them pivot towards science. No, they will cherry pick scientific predictions, and insist that Fauci and others were just as clueless as themselves..."

That's what wearing a mask does.

But when you have an image-conscious president with a massive inferiority complex, and thousands of elected officials and millions of voters who take their cues from him, masks become a symbol of political correctness. And millions of people suffer, endure permanent damage, or die in the process."""

Our leaders, both Democrat and Republican have failed; the first from opening on a downward curve and the second by by opening pre-downward curve. Both cases are providing the fodder that the virus requested.

Add to that, the gullibility and ignorance of the majority of a general populace too eager to show ""bravery"" in the face of an unseen, but omnipresent adversary. 

True toughness would have been the ability of all citizens to adopt a more ascetic posture, such as the likes of New Zealand, to meet this virus toe to toe.

Pictures that I saw of the Trump's Tulsa rally made me shake my head in wonder - a gathering of predominantly white obese people not wearing masks. Such people are at great risk of death.

Now that Pandora's box was apparently opened in China, we have to deal with the problem and our response is important to our well being.

Moving forward we should ask ourselves how we could prevent the next Pandemic.  Curtailing international travel with countries with regulation that facilitates animal to human migration of Viruses is one.  Rapidly shutting down travel at the first indication of an outbreak is another.  Quarantining areas, including parts of the U. S. that have high infection rates is another.  Lastly we can stockpile  PPP and rigorously enforce its public use during a Pandemic."

These places were packed with people at the beginning of May.  It is no wonder nor surprise that Florida is experiencing highest singe-day totals of new cases.

This lack of perspective may be one reason many people feel at this point that the Coronavirus scare may be overblown. 

Though it would be wrong to dismiss the seriousness of the virus itself, it appears that the disease had little to no impact on those who participated in protest marches and the looting of stores a couple weeks ago.

The press must do much better job of reporting on this topic or it will begin to look like they are politicizing it and many more people will continue to behave as if the virus doesn't exist."
2020-06-25 14:21,"And yet deaths in the US continue to fall.  If we assume that the actual Case Fatality Rate (including confirmed and unconfirmed cases) is 0.07% (which matches the rate found in  Hubei province and seems to be validated by serum studies in Spain and NYC), we can then divide the number of deaths by that rate to get the ACTUAL number of cases.

In April, 2,000 were dying/day meaning a case rate of  300,000/day (our limited testing was finding about 30k cases or 1 out of 10).

in June, with about 800 dying/day that means a case rate of 100,000/day (our limited testing finding about 40k cases or 1 in 2.5).  

That's how the pandemic can look worse when it's getting better."
2020-06-25 14:32,"The cases that we are detecting now are infections that happened 7-8 days ago. Given the sharp rise in new cases in places like FL, AZ, TX, there are *already* close to double the number of new infections today as are being detected now, but those people will not be tested and identified for another 7-8 days.

Even if DeSantis were to take real measures today, by July 4th there will be about 10,000 new infections detected a day. That rise in daily new infections is unavoidable, because detection lags infection. 

But I see no sign that DeSantis is going to do anything effective, and he is hiding Florida's hospitalization data and death toll. The Florida hospitals are in for a very very difficult time."
2020-06-25 13:43,"I recall that at the start of this pandemic, in February, medical professionals predicted that at least a year, maybe a year-and-a-half, would pass before Covid-19 faded away and/or a vaccine was developed to wipe it out.

When that time frame was reported, the prospect of having to stay sequestered for that much time seemed horrible.

Now, due to the refusal of scores of people to stay hunkered down to the original frustrating-- but essential -- time constraints, increasing are not only new Covid-19 cases, but also the likelihood that the pandemic will last LONGER than originally projected.

There has been no mandate for wearing a face mask in public, people continue to gather in huge masses at the beaches, parks, bars, etc. and his is STILL going to open the state for business while new cases continue to increase on a daily basis.

I'm somewhat cynical about my fellow citizens and suspect that the rebound will be predictable from things like percentage of college grads in the populations, voting red or blue in elections, and per capita income; i.e. it's going to be a state IQ test.

Cuomo was late to the party. But once the magnitude of the crisis was evident, he followed the science and we were mostly disciplined with face masks and social distancing. Although the protests were not helpful, at least they were outdoors and protesters seemed to wear face masks. New York has been following the CDC guidelines for when and how to open, and is bearing the fruit of science based behavior. However, red state governors (except DeWine and Hogan), along with their residents, behaved like petulant children at a toy store, unable to control their need for instant gratification.

While I agree that this administration is very much culpable in allowing this virus to spread, it is also the failure of not only the administration to dump this on the states without any guidelines and mandatory steps to stop the spread. It is also the American public who is also responsible. 

We can take all the precautions in the world to stop this but when we have Dear Leader going against the sound advice of scientists and not setting the example, or when protesters, while being outdoors were also not as responsible as they could be. I applaud their courage but at the same time I also can't get behind Americans who for all their lauded praise and determination still put the rest of us in mortal danger. Increases are really a direct result of Americans screaming about their rights while endangering others. 

It is pretty simple in its logic. Wear a mask. ALWAYS indoors or even outdoors. For God's sake, stop thinking it is time to party like it is 1999. Get together with friends (less than 5 at a time) at homes. Not in bars or restaurants. With all the social media out there you can't say you can't stay in touch with family and friends. Do this. The logic is simple. If you don't, then mandatory shelter in place will happen again and unemployment will happen again, and lives will be lost... again.

We have some citizens doing everything possible to remain uninfected while others are doing virtually everything possible to become infected. We have one federal government mouthpiece communicating one variation of critical information (a.k.a ""version of the truth"") with another saying virtually the opposite. 

We're told one day we have ammunition that will work. Within hours we are told it won't work. If we were fighting a visible enemy would we be told that casualties wouldn't be as high if we didn't report them? If we were fighting a visible enemy like this war is being engaged, it would be over by now. 

In a word, Americans, we are losing."
2020-06-25 15:16,"We actually need a high rate of spread of the virus in order to complete the clinical trials expeditiously. 

Let’s just look at the vaccine trials, of which there are now about a dozen. In phase III, each trial will need tens of thousands of non-infected subjects. Half will get the real vaccine, and half will get a placebo. 

Imagine there’s no rate of spread and the virus is eliminated. In that case, none of the placebo subjects get sick, and we won’t be able to prove that the vaccine worked. 

If there’s a low rate of spread, it will take a lot more subjects to show a statistical significance. 

But if there’s a high rate of spread, many placebo subjects will get sick, showing a statistical difference with the vaccinated subjects with much fewer subjects, thus accelerating the time to complete the trial. 

Ironically, to all those who hold science out as the “be all end all” of truth, placebo controlled clinical trials depend on placebo subjects getting sick, some of whom will die! 

I’m not sure of the morality in that, but that’s what our “science” based system of drug approvals demand. (Note other countries don’t allow placebo controlled trials.) 

This is an area that people should understand and pay more attention to."

The younger, the better.  I have talked with a very large number of young students, professionals, and college athletes who pretty much don't care about the elderly and at-risk.  Their idea of protecting them is creating assisted living facilities akin to a super-max prison.  One noticed four roughly 80 year old gentlemen seated near us at an outdoor cafe and wondered why they were even out and ""asking for it"".  Another noted that it might open up career advancement as it could force older partners and managers into retirement.  This is clearly a young/wealthy/healthy attitude I've found.  They don't worry about older parents since mom and dad are older/wealthy/healthy and this demographic is pretty well able to protect themselves without huge lifestyle compromise.  One anxious to return to college student said it shouldn't be a problem in his college town if people who were at-risk just ""stayed clear"" of the returning students.  In CT, the estimate is 30% of residents are high risk - sounds like about 1 million people will be in hiding."

Partly this is attributed to reopening the economy - most of CA is in opening phase 3 (out of 5)

But those counties that did not move to phase 3, most in the SF area, ALSO reported an increases, puzzling the experts.   Because,  in CA it is mandatory (as opposed to some Southern States) to wear masks in public.

So why the increase ?   To what degree can one rely on masks during opening ?

It can take out a 90 year old in a nursing home faster than an AK-47. Another person could sail through life, never realizing he has been a victim.

Protecting the life of a nursing home resident requires a different approach to that of a healthy 35 year old. Let’s allow for this.

We are going to have to assume that a lot of people throughout the world are going to be affected. Attempts at prevention are unlikely to be fully successful.

It seems as the virus spreads it is becoming less virulent and deadly so that is a good sign and of course in the 21st Century in advanced nations we have clean water, sewer systems, antibiotics, steroids, anti-malarial drugs, ventilators, etc. which should help keep the death rate from the plague down instead of the death toll of 750,000 Americans who died in the 1918-1920 pandemic and roughly 50,00,000 who perished worldwide."

Cowardly and comtemptuous.

I am sick of the empty proclamations from inepts like Kemp and DeSantis who say, well, we won't mandate it, but pretty please, we think maybe you should wear a mask and use precautions, but do go out and get this economy going. Go to the office, eat out, buy cars and trinkets at the mall, just don't hold us accountable when it goes south. 

There is no economic recovery without a solid proper pandemic response. Experts have said this for months. The GOP ignored these nuts and bolts in favor of their, frankly, delusional insistence that the virus conform to THEIR framework for what they will PERMIT in the way of governance and response. 

Delusional. From the Fed to these states to the people that support and model themselves after these failed leaders.

It's time to enforce social distancing in all businesses, especially bars and restaurants by enforced government mandates and inspections. Words matter little without forceful leadership. The restaurant in Houston would not be allowed to operate here in Rhode Island many other states.

This is nothing more than back door social engineering whereby the virus is allowed to reach a higher infection rate that they hope soon stabilizes without overwhelming the hospitals.   All it does is contain it as a new,higher, infection rate.  It may level off but probably won't decline in the near future. Nothing more than slow culling of the Texas populace.

Of course some states are hit later than others, densely populated areas hit differently than rural or suburban areas. Though the US government acted late and inadequate (some would say deliberately careless), some states, helped by the general US lock-down, never took control of the virus or merely acknowledged the danger. 

It is hard to see how the US can get a grip, having failed the first nation-wide lockdown, lacks adequate test, track and trace in many places plus enjoys a government claiming the pandemic is over.

Many of the newly hit US states still have a chance to get some control, but it will demand much harsher precautions, lock-downs, containment and quarantines in style with the efforts in more successful US states and foreign nations.

The pandemic is not a partisan political game, it doesn't matter the ""blue states"" were hit first and initially hardest, and took too long to react responsibly many places. The failures of others will only help if you can learn from them and avoid repeating the disasters.

But it seems impossible in the US."

We desperately need a national leader to enforce masks for all individuals anywhere out of there homes, masks should also be worn in crowded housing, and at least while the weather is good all stores should be outside only.  Nothing else makes any sense and we have to do this quickly before fall."

2020-06-25 18:29,"The response of the Texas governor ( and other governors) to increased cases reminds me of our work  with USAID in the early 80's in Congo/Zaire.  The goal of USAID was to build barriers on top of the cliff called  ""lack of preventive medical care"" to prevent patients from falling off the cliff only to be rescued by the ""ambulance"" (the  hospital ) waiting at the bottom of the cliff to treat patients.  One of the answers was to train village health workers to do preventive care in their own villages.  The analogy is apt.  Today we are hearing of governors working hard to make sure their hospitals have enough ventilators and beds to ""catch"" those falling off this cliff where there are few barriers against the virus.

On the envelope there is a box to check if the person is deceased and instruction to put back in the mail.  They did this. The check was delivered IN THE SAME ENVELOPE a second time. Now they wrote in big red letters RETURN TO SENDER PERSON IS DECEASED.  The check was mailed back again a third time in the SAME ENVELOPE with the big red letters.

COVID-19 mated with STUPID-45 and the new strain is proving to be very contagious and deadly.

My people have said that the most obvious symptoms are:

• aversion to masks
• aversion to social distancing
• propensity to tune in to FOX and OANN
• difficulty in drinking a glass of water
• difficulty in going down a ramp
• inability to tell the truth

Could it be true? I dunno, you tell me. But a lot of people are saying it."
2020-06-25 18:48,Trump and the GOP viewed the pandemic ithrough the lens of political strategy and gambled that covid would taper off after June. it now appears that the gamble was a massive mistake. The play was about 2 months early.  The strategy of making dems look anti-business and supportive of oppressive government might have worked beyond their most loyal base if they had waited till august or even September. The reality  is that they can't do a 180 with their base and the rest of voters recognize that the GOP strategy does not address and even worsens the raging pandemic.
2020-06-25 18:53,"I left Houston on May 31st to return to Maine for the summer.  

Throughout May in Houston the mood was more 'what virus?'  It was a sign of strength and masculinity to [proudly] not wear a mask.  Forget about trying to social distance when at the grocery store or when out for a walk. At the local HEB grocery store maybe 65% of the people wore masks.  Texas lagged behind other states in testing and that seemed acceptable. 

Here in Maine most stores outside of grocery and drugstores  are still shut down.  When you do go to the grocery store there is a certain tenseness to everyone there.  95% of the people wear a mask.  There is a strict limit on the number of people allowed in a store at one time.   

After bragging about Texas exceptionalism and the early opening of the economy, the TX governor is surprised there's a surge?

I fear the chickens have come home to roost.   Texas is not prepared for what is likely coming their way.  I'm very worried. 

Maine could still see another surge, but I sense the folks here are much better prepared if it happens."

This is the obvious result. Heck, just yesterday afternoon at Central Market in Lamar St. I saw a white entitled male (with a New York accent) plunge his hands into a bin full of mushrooms, and proceeded to handle the pieces. Of course, no face covering. I pointed to him the tissues placed by management to handle produce, but went away with his female companion cursing and making inappropriate comments about face coverings and the virus itself. Both proceeded to handle other vegetables and fruit, oblivious to any preventive measure.  That’s what we are dealing with, Mr. Abbott. The time to force people wear masks is past due!"

This ""temporary pause"". as the Governor likes to call it, is necessitated by his over-eagerness to open his state nearly two months ago on May 1st. And now he and the people of Texas are dealing with the consequences of that.

How can Texans trust their Governor to ""safely enter the next phase of opening our state"" when his first such ""entry"" got them to where they are now.

Yes, I live in New Hampshire, but I have family in Texas and I am concerned about them."

2020-06-25 19:27,We are not the only ones who are seeing a significant increase in coronavirus cases. Europe has also seen many more cases and they were on a downturn. Maybe it’s best that we don’t go to Europe right now with their cases￼ seeing an uptick. Maybe they are doing us a favor by not letting US citizens enter their country.

Case numbers exploded right after he opened the state up because he did it too quickly. In Harris County where I live, our ICUs are full already and the state is business as usual. Waterparks and movie theaters are open. Abbot isn't mandating masks and no one is social distancing. How is this supposed to help? Two extra empty beds in a few hospitals will accomplish nothing."

Yet Trump insisted on burying his head in the sand instead of preparing. Instead of consulting with and diligently working with experts, industry, and the public (like other countries) to control a resurgence he did nothing but deny, deny, deny. Instead of leading by example by wearing a mask and encouraging responsible behavior by those who (astonishingly) look up to him, he flaunted precautions and emboldened stupidity.

In this case, it was in the wheelhouse of bumbling, mealy-mouthed Treasury secretary, Steve Mnuchin, the same guy who, with fellow predator-investors during the Great Recession, bought up mortgages and then evicted the homeowners from their own homes with little or no notice.  

Mnuchin is a classic example of the incompetence and corruption in charge of this administration.

As she was in an Assisted Living home, for the last three and half years we've take delivery of her mail at a NYC PO Box.  But we were out of town most of this Spring so we hadn't picked up mail there since earlier in May.  

So I'm not sure exactly when her ""stimulus check"" arrived.  It could've been before she passed.

Anyway, on the envelope there were instructions to anyone getting it that if the recipient was deceased they should not open it.  Instead they should put a mark in the box on the front of the envelope and immediately re-mail it to be returned to the US Treasury.  They threatened a $10,000 fine if any attempt was made to cash it instead.

So, being a good honest Blue State liberal, I immediately returned it unopened.  I  put a big checkmark in the indicated  spot using a black magic marker pen and put it in a mailbox for return to sender.

A few days later I went to my PO box to get the mail.

Yep, you guessed it.  That same envelope (now with my checkmark on it) was re-delivered to us instead of being returned to the Treasury!

This time I handed it to the clerk at the PO window and told her what had happened.  Still not sure what will occur when I next pick up the mail.

Oh, meantime, separately my Mom also got this nice long letter telling her the check was on its way.

The president can get away with this because our system of government (and all it's ""freedoms"") require respect for the party not in power, and for the public. If we elect a president who doesn't respect these things, there is no mechanism to compel him to. As for November - that is a pipe dream. This country has been bought and paid for a long time ago, through lobbying money, special interest groups, racism, and gerrymandering.

Every needed for humanity to survive has been tied to money; food, water, clothing, safety, health...everything.  Money is also used to manipulate people into believing that their wants are just as important as their needs and to top it off, the people are told what their wants are.

As an alternate perspective, during the great depression, those people who lived in the hills of Kentucky and Tennessee, they didn't even know that a depression was happening.

Today, farmers are plowing crops under (because of money), Milk farms are pouring thousands of gallons of milk into the ground (because of money)... but this administration gave 2 Trillion dollars to companies where very little of it made it to the people so they could survive.

It's astonishing that our federal government didn't use the initial shutdown to create a national testing plan and find ways to massively ramp up testing capacity. If it were free and easy for individuals and businesses to secure regular tests, we could do a much better job isolating infected people while still keeping the economy open. The testing situation in Arizona makes me so sad for the failed state of our country. Trump would have politically benefitted so much by taking drastic, unprecedented measures to have the federal government boost testing capacity, and we would have benefitted as a nation. By trying to make a political calculation and taking little action on testing, he not only risked our nation's economy and health, but he shot himself in the foot too. I don't expect Trump to do what's right for the nation, but I'm amazed that he fails to even look out for his own self-interest.

With that being said, we cannot afford to shut down again. The death rate is remarkably low for adults under 65, and it's clear that half-measures have not succeeded in slowing this virus.

We got a few side eyes in red states but wore a mask every time we stepped out of the car.

Little is said about it either way. Many people wear them, others don't. But the governor is not mandating them, and social distancing isn't enforced either, as crowded businesses opened long ago. 

Abbott's ""pause"" on reopening isn't a pause at all. He merely banned elective surgical procedures, which does not address the cause of the problem.

2020-06-25 22:47,"Socializing outside and, of course , at least 6 feet apart, should be considered as crucial as wearing a mask. Consider shopping at outdoor farmers markets for fruit and vegetables.

 Patronize those market vendors  who  enforce  safe distancing, require customers to wear masks and where the vendors  wear masks too. Ideally, vegetables and fruit are pre-packaged, limiting exposure to many customers touching them.  

Socializing inside, especially in smaller spaces raises risk, although opening  windows will help greatly. A screened porch is ideal. 
And  time matters. If you’re  inside, limiting interaction to a 1/2 hour is best but not realistic for many social visits.A mix of indoor and outdoor activities can permit safe and longer visits. ."

Kudos to Texas' governor, who stopped the re-opening.  He's on the ball, and people are fighting him.

Then there's Egypt, cases ever-rising, they're welcoming tourists?  One would have to have a death wish to go there.

New York is a concern.  They're at Phase 3 of re-opening, but the U.S. as a whole is really infected, and the virus does not respect State lines.  Is New York's 14 day quarantine for  visitors from hotspots enforceable?  

All things concerning Covid-19 should be done with care and prudence, except for supplying masks, PPE, test kits, test sites and respirators.

Even mailing unemployment checks -- this must be done accurately, not with panic.  That $1.4 billion sent to dead people will never be returned...likely, their heirs will claim it.

Time for Mitch McConnell to light a fire under himself and the Senate and pass a generous unemployment package ... another 1.5 million claims were filed last week."

Massive dead is not."

2020-06-25 21:47,"Even as Texas health officials grappled with the surge, the state’s attorney general, Ken Paxton, asked the Supreme Court on Thursday to overturn the Affordable Care Act, which has extended health insurance to more than 1.1 million Texans while protecting state residents who have pre-existing medical conditions.
Remember when the ACA was being debated and watered down by Republicans in Washington, they created the term “Death Squads” to scare people into thinking that the law would enable the government to decide if Granny lived or died. When TX citizens are most likely to need healthcare due to the “too soon to succeed” opening of the TX economy, a Republican TX death squad wants to take away healthcare with nothing in place to cover those thrown off of coverage."

2020-06-25 21:36,"How did our country, once a leader in medical research, become what we are today-a country led by a dolt, local leaders that follow that dolt, and people that believe what the dolt says.

It didn’t take a rocket scientist to predict that if we became complacent the virus would take advantage of that complacency.

Yet we have politicians and many people who failed to listen to scientists that still believe the virus would just go away, it's not worse than the flu.

Just when I thought things could not get worse on Trump’s watch, we read about billions of dollars that found their way to-dead people.  Hmm.  Are these the same dead people that voted?  Given our president* continues to buy votes why not buy votes from the dead in hopes that may pull his polling numbers up (sarcasm, folks).
Imagine the screeching and yowling we would here from Lindsay Graham if the president was a Democrat.

Lastly, as we progress into a resurgence of covid-19 with much of the blame on the shoulders of Trump adherents in our local governments, it is alarming a state would initiate legal proceedings to have the ACA declared illegal-just when many will need that safety net.  Good job."
2020-06-25 22:09,"How is it that Ken Paxton, Texas' Attorney General, ask the Supreme Court to overturn the Affordable Care Act? I thought the Senate voted it to be Unconstitutional? What a mess if the Supreme Court overturns the ACA after millions have died and even more have been sick and recovered with medical bills. Gov. Abbott must be more than desperate."
2020-06-25 22:09,"Thirty-nine people died of covid-19 in Texas yesterday.  Compare that to 700+ per day in New York at the height of the pandemic there.  The death rate could climb 10 times in Texas and it would still be at the level New York was at when it began to open up.

It's reasonable to do things like restrict elective surgery to ensure hospital beds.  It's not reasonable to scare monger."

2020-06-25 22:34,"This is very serious.  We now have measured data that supports what many experts have telling us.  There are about 10 times more infected people than confirmed cases.  

This is highly significant due to the exponential growth of the virus.  With marginal mitigation, and, if the number of infections doubles in 6 weeks, by next Nov., 200 million people will have been infected and one million will have died.  That's enough to generate herd immunity which will then allow the infection to burn out.  But 20 million will have gotten very sick and one million will have past away.  That's a very high price to pay.

We have some serious decisions to make right now.  It is obvious that the nation is fed up and won't tolerate another lockdown.  But the virus is just beginning to take hold.  Do we just let it run wild and suffer the consequences?  Or do we all wear masks and social distance?  Or do we all retreat  to our homes and go stark raving mad?  It would be nice if someone was in charge."

2020-06-25 23:13,"""Cases Are Probably 10 Times Higher Than the Official Count, C.D.C. Says""


In this world where non science believer's like Trump are running wild, who knows what to believe. There a lots of models to estimate the actual number of infections and this 10x higher is just another one. I doubt this estimate is correct,  But if you you want to use a simple way to get within true range of our actual case load. Use data from places that did enough testing early on like South Korea. If you use their data the death rate from Covid 19 is in the 2-2.5% range not the 5.8 % range our data suggests. We have missed at least a  few hundred thousand asymptomatic infected because we have mainly tested the symptomatic. So  here is some simple math : 122,000 Covid deaths/death rate 2%/ .02 =6,100,000 cases.Which is closer to 3 times higher than the official count which actually sounds more plausible than 10 times. So we probably have 3 times as many cases not 10. More extensive testing will confirm who is correct."
2020-06-25 23:15,"More infections than we thought?

This is important, and a very positive discovery. 

Why?

This means the COVID mortality rate is much lower than previously believed."
2020-06-25 23:22,A 10X higher infection level means the mortality rate is much lower than thought - which cast great doubt about the decision to lock down states and destroy our economy.
2020-06-25 23:29,"What is the CDC statement that 5 to 8% of Americans have been infected based on? I wish CDC would do mass random testing of say 1,000 people each in a few selected areas to find out the level of population exposure, but it's too bad this has not been done."
2020-06-25 23:39,"If 90% of infections are not being identified, that means that the denominator for morbidity and mortality is 10 times higher, ie, the morbidity and mortality rate is 10 times less that current statistics show. This is great news, since most untested cases are going to be mild enough that a person shrugs it off."
2020-06-26 0:09,"Are we to assume this finding applies worldwide? That is to say, does the 1 in 10 figure apply to the rest of the world? If so, for the vast majority of the human population the ""disease"" is little more than a minor infection, with symptoms in many cases milder than the common cold.

So then, you really have to ask, has the global response to the pandemic really been the right way to handle this virus? Few other diseases in human history have prompted this level of worldwide restrictions on the free movement of human beings.

Would it not have been better to focus resources on protecting those individuals most likely to develop severe symptoms? A one-size-fit-all response to a virus with wildly varying degrees of severity seems like the wrong way to go. Why hasn't the World Health Organization stepped up to the plate and propose a strategy of targeted prevention and treatment protocols rather than the mass quarantine it has advocated?"

2020-06-25 23:02,"Trump insists that health experts and the media are “exaggerating” the pandemic and deny claims that he acted inadequately. Therefore he blames them for his sagging poll numbers. 

I’d like to compare this to what’s happening here in Ontario, Canada. Our Premier (similar to a state governor), Doug Ford, was being broadly compared to Trump pre-pandemic, even named: Canada’s Trump. His deeply conservative policies were so unpopular that his approval ratings were 31% in February. During the pandemic, he listened to healthcare experts and implemented their suggestions effectively. We have successfully flattened the curve, and our case numbers have been <200 per day for the past week (Ontario’s population is ~15 million). Ford’s approval ratings have soared to ~70%! 

People are not dumb; they can recognize leadership in times of crisis and respond to facts. Trump can keep blaming the media and some of his followers will believe that, but I’m sure that most can see through that and will make their voices heard in November."

Were it only pathetic.  It actually feels criminal.  

The irony is that if Trump had actually mustered even the most basic empathy, understanding, command presence and extolled the advice of the experts and expertise at his disposal he might be enjoying unrivaled support and popularity across the country.  

Instead he bemoans how it has affected his political fortunes, casts himself as the victim and indulges denial while the country burns."

whereas supposedly New York and neighboring states

Simple math --
lower rates usually double faster than high rates.

In deaths per capita,
New York and its neighboring states in the Northeast
still have far higher rates than the national average,
three, four and five times the national average.

Next highest in deaths per capita,
still twice the national average,

In contrast,
other states in the Midwest, South and West

With essentially no national leadership to enforce any of these steps, we are seeing the disastrous results as the virus surges out of control in mostly red states that have followed Trump's  denial and his self-serving push for them to reopen without adhering to his own guidelines that, if followed, would have prevented the calamity in the southern tier from Arizona through Texas and on into Florida. This is a massive failure of leadership on both the national and state levels and the consequences have been and will continue to be fatal for thousands.

C.	Hold mass rallies where few wear masks; model noncompliance with mask-wearing; cut back on coronavirus testing funds; suggest that people ingest bleach; propose other unscientific and potentially harmful “cures;” make racial slurs; politicize COVID-19; and pretend that the coronavirus is just like the flu and quickly becoming a nonissue.

We need emergency plans for viral pandemics always in place.  Anyone, as Trump and Bolton, that try to disband them should be jailed immediately.
People should respect health care and other workers that support us, and pay them accordingly.  I don't see many giants of industry really doing much, although I think they've collected more stimulus money than the dead people.  But, they were trying.

Did a reporter, on the call with Dr. Redfield, ask if this CDC claim is a result of a rigorous CDC statistical study?

You would think that politicians would recognize by now that the approach that saves the most lives and does the least economic damage is to take firm action rapidly and then encourage and mandate responsible behavior, e.g., by mandating the use of masks.

But too many red states governors refuse to take a rational approach, and our ""president"" is so out of touch with reality that he might as well be in an insane asylum.

Too many as well think that life can go back to normal before a vaccine arrives. We can live without movie theaters, we can live without bars, and yes, we can live without in-person church services or any large gathering in enclosed spaces. This is where you get super spreader events.

If everyone wore a mask and took precautions at work and at home, we could likely slow the spread of the disease sufficiently for testing and contact tracing. But with a complete absence of leadership from the White House, there's little chance that this is going to happen."

A complete lock down, coupled with the formula of four Ts, viz., tracing, tracking, testing and treating, could have turned the tide and flattened the curve. I too understand that lock down is not the cure. But certainly it would help the government and medical staff to treat the existing patients and plan an exit strategy.

Gains aren't reported weekly but some hint can be obtained by looking at the insured unemployment rate where the most recent reading is 13.4% down from 14.6% a month ago; it seems more jobs are being created than lost. In fact the preliminary Bloomberg estimate for net June employment out a week from Friday is +3 million jobs.

Look this isn't apologizing for Trump, and sure the recent rise in cases threatens these gains, and may possibly reverse them throughout the summer. But I look at this utterly incomplete report on current job conditions and when I read any other story in the Times it makes me wonder what are you leaving out?"
2020-06-25 13:24,"1.5 million workers file new sate unemployment claims last week. On Tuesday, Republican U.S. Senator John Cornyn of Texas said he would oppose any further stimulus checks to citizens. Instead he wanted government support given to oil and gas companies.

2020-06-25 13:39,"Please call your Republican Senators and demand they draft a stimulus bill FAST. This is a disgrace. 

We need UBI! We need $2K per adult per month until this is all over. Anyone still working (particularly in essential work) gets a nice surplus each month. Anyone unemployed knows they can depend on at least $4K a month to pay their bills.

We have 20M people unemployed and there will be A LOT more as states close down again and corporations get antsy and start laying off  more white collar jobs. People will need cash to sustain this otherwise we are looking at civil unrest as well as an economic crash.

Currently, I am working for 20% less because my public company issued pay cuts across the board and my husband was laid off in March with no sense of return."

2020-06-25 13:40,A virus doesn't care about the economy. It doesn't care about political parties or our cash flow problems. It cares about replication; that's it. And COVID-19 does an excellent job of it. It's so ironic that a country with the strongest military in the world could be brought to its knees by an organism 40 nm in diameter. We have no respect for the natural world. It is sending us loud warning signs that we cannot continue abusing and destroying it without eventually destroying ourselves. Will we ever listen?
2020-06-25 13:47,"Jobless claims really alarming in the US. The Trump administration is also in a state of shock and finding it difficult to address the issue. How many issues can they handle at a time - corona, joblessness, death due to hunger and an 'unexpected' racism issue. But it is their 'job' to find solutions to all the above mentioned issues. Having 'plateful of problems' President Trump  is nowadays concentrating only on his re-election for the second term. In between if gets any time, he is issuing statements warning China or offering mediation to India in its border disputes with the same China. Workers may not have jobs, but Trump has enough jobs - finding a solution to the virus issue and saving citizens from the virus, creating jobs to the jobless workers, finding ways for businesses to reopen, addressing racism issues and so on and so forth."
2020-06-25 13:57,"If we had a competent federal government we could have been reducing the jobless claims instead of seeing them remain as high as they still are. The country ineeds repair of all of its infrastructure. Why not put federal dollars to work rebuilding all of those things that are needed to bring the us into the future instead of leaving us with deteriorating roads, electric grids, etc.  We can do that now while protecting workers from this coronavirus. We have listened to the mantra of ""less government, lower taxes,  and the private sector can do it better intoned by Republicans / Conservatives and, like the incompetent ""president"" they chose, the Republicans are at a total loss about what to do next. TrIckle-down is not good enough. The McConnell do-nothing Senate costs us tax payers more for the salaries we pay them than any good they have done for the country. Only the federal government with its powers of taxation can readjust the wealth distribution to make the economy work for everyone. Time to rethink what so-called ""conservative"" government has done and is unable to do. We can do it if we just wake up and smell the rotting decay coming from those old men in the Congress and White House. Time for new blood and a renewal of ideas to make a government that cares about ALL of us, not just those who pay for elections."

2020-06-25 14:21,"Job ≠ Job

If someone used to work as an engineer at Boeing or as a pilot for a mayor airline and is now working at a grocery store stocking shelves, this person technically still has a job and won't show up in the statistics of total unemployed, but still is making way less money, has less/no benefits and no job security.

Far more interesting than the statistic of total jobs lost/created is the statistic what kind of jobs were lost and what kind of jobs were created - and what the differences in pay and beneefits are. For example: After the financial crisis of '08, we saw a rise in the so called ""gig economy"". People still had/found work, but the condition of their employment - and in consequence their quality of life - was completely different (worse) than before.

Another important factor is where (location) jobs are lost and created: if, for example, a family-owned manufacturing business, deeply ruted in the rural community it was founded generations ago goes belly up during the pandemic, the chances of the same kind of jobs returning to the rural community are very slim. The jobs may come back, but they will do so in a big city, forcing people to migrate. This will take money, diversity and chances for young people out of rural areas - with all the political consequences much discussed here in this paper.

So please NYT, more reporting on the details of jobs lost and created, because like so often: details matter!"

Being in the high risk group with preexisting conditions and over 60, I am only interested in work at home jobs. I’m sure it will be a long slog to find a new job, or a proven vaccine. Either way, this could have been prevented if our government had taken the E.U. approach and guaranteed companies and workers a % of their income until the pandemic is over.

Really? Who cashed them or does Steve Mnuchin even care?
This is what happens when you defund departments and fire supposedly 'unnecessary' staffers.
All to avoid accountability. Trump has never wanted anyone else to know what he has done. And Little Stevie has used the Treasury Dept. to dole out money to the GOP and their donors. And, yes, maybe even big Donnie. No staffers to blow the whistles, conduct the audits, avoid being transparent and responsible.
But Mnuchin loves to fly at taxpayer expense to look at all those bills with his name on them.

""Open our county,"" ""Stop testing,"" are just two of his preposterous goals in the midst of the worst pandemic in one hundred years.  The numbers of jobs lost, the numbers of those infected and subsequently dying, mean nothing to this man.  His fantasy world is crushing those of us who are forced to live and be victims of the real world.  And yet, Congress, i.e., the Senate, does little to nothing to stop this foolishness.

The US congress appropriates monies but it is the responsibility of the president's cabinet to ensure that tax payers are not cheated.

Cutting the Pentagon budget in half while at the same time dragging them before public hearings to find out why they cannot report how over $20 trillion was spent over the past 30 years is a good thing all on its own.

I am astounded that Trump has any support at all for this disastrous economy which he has so mismanaged because his lack of leadership with the COVID pandemic. This economy is in very tough shape and no matter how much happy talk or magical thinking Trump rants out daily, we are in trouble.

-imperiling of key industries and economic sectors

-2.3 million and 121,228 Covid-19 cases and deaths

-destabilized healthcare system

-diminished public education system

-deteriorating infrastructure

-overturning of environmental safeguards

-denial of climate change

-alienation of international allies

-disregard of basic US values such as freedom of speech, press, assembly, etc

-championing of white supremacy 

-increasing civic disharmony

So where might we as a nation be had we a genuine leader, one who

-cared for all the citizens in the nation

-is capable of listening to the disaffected as well as the enamored

-can model good citizenship, such wearing a mask during a pandemic, demonstrating respect of others, promoting honesty,...

-can prioritize and attend to immediate needs and the welfare of citizens and not waste time on dubious projects such as memorializing traitors of the US and their racist heritage?

Perhaps if we had a genuine leader our taxes would be a little higher, but our social good would be so much better and so would our futures. Maybe the reward for this pandemic, for enduring our current neglectful leaders, will be increased regard for others and our collective welfare."

For too long voter apathy, district gerrymandering, and a ""news as entertainment"" has continually dumbed down the citizens.  It has taken a toll and now the bill is due.

Donald J Trump...with hundreds of thousands of Americans dead and 40-50 million Americans out of work...must be soundly rejected in the 2020 election.  He, his family and the corrupt members of his administration must be held accountable and they should all go to prison.  Anything less simply perpetuates the culture of corruption and dysfunction in American government.

Mitch McConnell and each and every Republican enabler of Trump in the House and Senate also needs to be soundly routed out of government in November. Only with a clear, definitive Democratic majority in the House and Senate can this country stop this bleeding and begin the vast national reconstruction that will be required to undo decades of damage wrought by corrupt American governance. Divided government and politics as usual will be the deathblow of our country if Americans don't make their voice heard loud in November.

If McConnell and Senate Republicans play politics and refuse to pass the House's Heroes Act, the BLM protests will pale in comparison to the broad and vast anger of Americans who are currently living on the edge and facing a bleak future of poverty and homelessness."
2020-06-25 16:15,"This is an absolutely unprecedented loss of jobs.  Recall that the previous record for weekly UI claims was 695,000 set back in October of 1982 -- almost 40 years ago! 

Having more than 1 million new claims -- for the14th straight week!! -- that should be difficult for anyone to wrap their head around!

And, for those who still remain employed, there's massive change.  When companies decide to essentially move tens of millions of employees out of offices and into remote work, this represents a fundamental restructuring in our economy.  

Studies point to all kinds of ways remote workers are more productive and more efficient when they work outside a crowded office filled with meetings and casual chit-chats about sports.  So, given this increase in productivity from going remote, why should companies rehire millions of workers?  Hint:  they shouldn't, and they won't.

Note that empty skyscrapers means that companies are saving billions on real estate and facilities costs.... and they don't have to pay the salaries for the jobs needed to maintain all that real estate:  janitors, cafeteria, catering, transportation, retailers, business services, etc., etc."

But, it would not have mattered to her.  She worked at Children's Hospital in Houston, TX where polio was the most dread disease.

Congratulations to these researchers whose methods and capability were thorough and high and without profit motive.

Even more, if we tested everyone regularly for infection and did widespread antibody tests and compared that to flu vaccinations, the amount of data available for analysis would be vast. Without at least some of that data no one really knows whether there is a correlation or not.

Secondly, there are many more people today with suppressed immune systems from all of the new biologicals that effectively treat conditions from psoriasis to cancer.
All of these people would be at risk to develop polio if they came in contact with an attenuated virus even if they were immunized against polio as children.

2020-06-25 12:39,"There is actually a sound biologic basis for this.  When I was in medical school back in the 1970's we learned that infection with some viruses caused cells to produce a substance called ""interferon"" which made cells temporarily resistant to infection by other viruses (one of the discoverers of this substance, the late Dr. Monto  Ho, was  a member of the faculty).  We now know that ""interferon"" is actually a number of immunoregulatory substances that have a variety of different effects, resistance to viral infection being just one of them.  I don't mean to suggest that giving people polio vaccine or infecting them with other viruses is going to solve the coronavirus pandemic, but boosting resistance to infection by manipulating interferon response might be a fruitful area of research.  This is unlikely to yield anything useful in the short term, but this virus is going to be with us for a while, and this will definitely not be the last pandemic virus to emerge out of the forests."
2020-06-25 12:51,"When I got vaccinated against polio as a child in the￼ 60s and 70s it was always the sweet Sabin vaccine.  Easy to administer and loved by children.  I had my daughters in 1995 and 1997.  At that point polio vaccine consisted of 4 separate vaccine doses.  Dr. Teel explained that our first daughter would get the first three doses and Salk injection vaccines because that vaccine was safer and did not result in wild virus transmission.  The 4th dose would be the oral vaccine abuse it would make sure the gut was vaccinated.  There was still a very small risk of wild virus transmission.  When my second daughter was born in 1997, she received all 4 polio vaccinations using the Salk injection.  Dr. Teel explained that the oral vaccine had become too risky because it was the cause of some cases of polio being caught by non vaccinated individuals.  For the notion of brave trials on ones own children, you might come away with a different view if you read about the polio vaccine types that came before Dr. Salk’s success.  Polio:An American Story tells this story so well.  It tells about earlier failed trials and the improper use of institutionalized children as human research subjects.  The story before that exam is what we all need to know and understand."

Anybody can suffer from TMI, Too Much Information), but there is almost zero interest in discernment.  Yes, that boring topic which is about how to tell what truly affects us in the real world vs the imagined.  Even a solid high school education helps sort that out, yet even HS standard are reported to be slipping.  Overall, I am saying that there is too large a disrespect for education and that attitude in practice impacts our ability as a nation to grow, as well as get along with one another.

Correct me if I'm wrong, but using this logic, wouldn't that mean that the coronavirus itself is making its way into water supplies, given that so many people carry the virus?

Either this is true, or repurposing existing vaccines is being subverted.  The cynical side of me wonders if this is because repurposed vaccines carry much less profit for pharmaceutical companies."
2020-06-25 13:15,"As a physician who has seen the results of polio, and who also has a background in public health, my initial reaction was no way am I taking live polio vaccine. But that’s a knee jerk emotional response, and really it’s a statistical question. I’m sure some people have the opposite reaction, and think vaccine, give it to me now!

But it’s the science that matters. If 1/2.5m vaccinated gets a serious polio infection, how many COVID-18 cases are either lethal or have permanent sequelae? We have estimates of fatality, but are just starting to recognize serious lasting deficits in survivors. So we don’t know the long term morbidity of COVID-19. Then, if vaccinated you certainly get the infection, while you may or may not get COVID. So you also need to know your risk of getting COVID. Finally, the live polio needs to be repeated monthly. Is the risk of repeat vaccines cumulative? 

Unfortunately the bar is much higher for vaccines than treatments, because you have to account for the fact that anyone getting the vaccine might never get the infection anyway. Given a “risky” vaccine like this one, it makes sense to test only on people at high risk of becoming infected, maybe health care personnel in areas of high infection, or close contacts of known infections.

I hope cool heads prevail on this one, and the best statistical evidence is used to quantify the risk before charging ahead with a potentially dangerous vaccine. Polio was a bad disease."
2020-06-25 12:32,"Yes, thanks NYTimes; one of the early articles I read discussed the TB vaccine as a possible reason for some not getting as ill as others, or not at all.  Back in....February or early March. Also mentioned? Or maybe it led me to wonder about the pneumonia vaccines, and shingles vaccines; others.

Where are the medical history tracers, comparing the medical histories of those who have died, those who had mild symptoms, and those that have tested positive with no symptoms. What does each group have in common? Surely getting medical records permission from these people, their families, would be easier than asking them to be test subjects. Going back to those early cases on the cruise ships, there has to be a reason a husband gets very ill, and his wife gets..nothing. It can’t all be that sex differential that’s been discussed."

2020-06-25 13:31,"The body's immune system doesn't just lock down from exposure to Polio vaccine alone.  Or, for that matter, exclusively from live vaccines.  It has long been anecdotally observed that children exposed to a natural level of antigens  have less chronic recurrent infections, although I am not aware of a scientific study of the issue (only studies on isolation from potential allergens and subsequent development of allergies -- relevant, but probably linked to different immunological processes.) However, it has also been observed that children exposed to elevated levels of diverse viral antigens in daycares are more likely to end up being seen by pediatricians for multiple colds/ear infections/sore throats in excess of their non-daycare enrolled peers.  (Although it's not clear if the trend continues past a certain age of immune system development -- as again I am not aware of any robust study that compared school aged tweens and teens to home schooled children.)  

By isolating school aged children from natural exposure levels to antigens via. lockdown+ social distancing on ""public health"" grounds, we risk putting their immune systems into a depressed neutral state, from it's normal hyperactive state. This has been done to save grandma from covid when kids hug her (also because grandmas vote, kids don't), but the fact is that grandmas can show some restraint without putting kids in a bubble.

The controversial TB vaccine BCG produced the same effect. Controversial because while it offers some protection against TB, it makes interpreting the PPD skin test impossible. 
By the way when mentioning old vaccines and the Covid-19, the article should have mentioned that preventable diseases like measles and polio are on a sharp uptick, mostly in 3rd world countries, because vaccination schedules have ground to a halt due to a fear of catching C-19. Experts predict measles will kill more children in Africa than everyone killed by C-19. Mortality is only 1%, but it's far more contagious than C-19.

The Denier-in-Chief bragged that stopping travel from China (which wasn't done) helped (which it didn't), but he fails to note that on his watch it is America that is on many other countries' denial-of-entry lists. The one state that seems to have firm control of the virus, Hawaii, has basically seceded from the Union to achieve this. Another state, Alaska, benefits from having Canada between it and the US mainland."

Even here in my state, where all decisions were going to be ""data driven"" guided by health experts--the UNC system of colleges and universities has decided that the best response to our surge of new cases and hospitalizations is . . . to gather in groups of 20,000 in a little over a month."

2020-06-24 15:54,"I thank Maine's lucky stars that we have a Democratic governor now, Janet Mills and a very competent state CDC director who have handled this pandemic well.  Some people are angry but most of us are following the science and being disciplined about staying home as much as possible and wearing masks, social distancing.  If Paul LePage was still governor, I'm sure we'd be in the same boat as Texas, Florida and Arizona.  

Our country, the US of A, is now in the same group of failed states with this virus as Brazil and Russia.

Good going, Republicans.  Great job.  (snark).

Really.  It's time to end the anti-science ignorance in America.  Vote every Republican out.  I, myself, cannot wait to vote for Biden and to vote against Suzie Q Collins who has a furrowed brow and is so 'concerned'.  If we want a country that's truly smart and decent, we must vote out every Republican.  That is clear as a bell."
2020-06-24 15:59,"I suggested, months ago, that the way to contain this was a comparatively short, very tight lock down. The short term (economic) pain would be sharp, but of short duration.  I posited then, that once you “reopened” you could never close again, and you could then never contain the pandemic.  

Now we are (predictably) left with the worst of all scenarios, long term, deep economic pain, long term, devastating social pain, illness and death counts.  

Whose to blame?  Leadership (if you can call it that) at the federal level writ large!  Many governors, such as Jay Inslee, Cuomo, Miller in Maine and Dewine in Ohio for example,did a great job with limited resources and a dearth of support from the feds.

To the contrary, governors like Ducey in AZ, DeSantis in FL and Abbott in TX have been criminally negligent, and are significantly responsible for the politicalization of the pandemic.  The sycophancy of Trump worship continues to prove deadly."

With the increased numbers every day it would be wise to walk back some of those re-openings. I’m also extremely concerned by the numbers and we haven’t even re-opened schools."
2020-06-24 16:04,"As an employee who was instructed to return to the office starting Monday, I am actively pushing back with HR on this as we watch these cases spike in cities that reopened. I am too anxious to ride the subway, go into the office as one of 25% of the workforce of my company, get my temp checked, replace my mask with company issued one and follow the other protocols when I can safely work at home for the near future or even permanently. My company is pushing us to go back to justify their fancy real estate costs. It's very frustrating to feel like a guinea pig to test out this phase in."
2020-06-24 16:11,"My big worry is when the small business PPP funding for paying employees ends. I think this happens in July (I'm not sure). It's been keeping the economy afloat...church staff, restaurants, etc. Likewise with the unemployment boost for the self-employed that runs out after July. 

I can't imagine how bad things will be when this safety net disappears. And when small businesses that have opened up find out they can't keep going with fewer customers coming in. 

We have to be prepared but the Republicans are saying ""let's wait and see."" 

Let them eat cake."
2020-06-24 16:32,"I don't get it - nothing has changed since the virus appeared in February-March, so why would anyone think that we can reopen things and we will get a different result than we did back in March? Of course infections are going to rise again.

It is also unclear on what exactly the strategy is; I get the feeling that we are just winging it with no real plan other than let's try this and see what happens. 

At one time the plan was to flatten the curve which I believe means an implicit acceptance of infections or deaths but try to keep it to a manageable level and not overwhelm the healthcare system. Is that still the plan? If it is, then a rise in infections is not necessarily bad since they were always an accepted part of that plan. Somebody needs to better communicate what our plan is. 

In any event, regardless of what the government allows to reopen, I am not going to any restaurants, theaters, or traveling until infections are almost non-existent. And I am wearing my mask, required or not. At the end of the day it is I who is responsible for my health. I am 70."
2020-06-24 16:11,"This is exactly what happens when there is no national leadership in a time of crisis.

If the government can mandate a nationwide legal drinking age, it can surely mandate mask wearing and social distancing for public health. The coronavirus doesn’t care where you are or what you believe, so why should the rules be any different?"
2020-06-24 16:22,"We can thank Trump and the gun-toting, “I-Want-a-Haircut” protestors of April for the too-early openings.  That, and Trump’s slow-the-testing policies have caused and will continue to bring about the needless deaths of thousands, ramped up uncertainty for schools and businesses, and made it difficult-to-impossible now to rein things in.  The only bright side is that it’s shone a blazingly bright light on Trump’s willful ignorance and callow disregard for Americans 4 1/2 months before election. But at an achingly high price."
2020-06-24 16:36,"Hey, lay the blame for early re-openings at trump's doorstep.  He wanted the virus to go away by denying it exists.  It didn't go away.  What will we all do?  Stay tightly locked in our homes till there is a vaccine?  Things will get worse when the gov't plans expire and people lose their homes and are  hungry.  If consumer spending drives the economy, there won't be much of it.  This ""cresting wave"" after re-opening is going to scare people more than the original wave did.  Again, Mr. "" I take no responsibility"" bears the burden for this ""cresting wave"".  Too vain to wear a mask, too concerned with his re-election to care about people. etc."

2020-06-24 16:34,The White House and a majority of the Republicans in politics are absolutely dense. Their only re-election strategy was the economy. They bungled that one. There should have been a national strategy and a recovery plan to attack this virus and its impact. Lives and jobs would not have been lost. The Defense Production Act could have focused on manufacturing masks and everyone should have been REQUIRED to wear masks when outside. We can still do that and get the economy back in shape. Where are all the medical lobbying groups when you need them? Where is the AMA who spends millions on lobbying each year? Do they not want to protect their very own healthcare workers on the frontline? What a SHAME!!!
2020-06-24 15:48,"yeah this is exactly what the experts said would happen if you open too quickly. The drawn out open and close cycle, and drawn out uncertainty, and drawn out fear are going to be far more economically destructive than if we had done one longer shut down and then reopened correctly instead of this mixed bag of nuts that we have now."
2020-06-24 16:18,"At the risk of being callous, what exactly did this country and our ""government"" expect when they gave into politically motivated theories, ideologies and started opening up this country again without enforcing the wearing of masks?

Someone near and dear, age 42, registered Republican, with no underlying health conditions, had a ""mild"" non-hospitalized case of covid19 here in the tri-state area. They recovered but it was excruciating. 

What sane person thinks a viral pandemic cares what political party you belong to?

The shame for all history is that a global pandemic was treated as a political football here in the United States. Beyond shameful."

2020-06-24 16:54,"This virus is going to be with us forever regardless of our actions in terms of openings, closings, etc. A vaccine will help, but based on the immune response to other similar viruses will not be a cure-all. It is time to get on with reopening and allow people to begin living again. There will likely be additional Covid19 infections and a few more deaths, but the pain of this is much less than the pain of forcing large swaths of our population to live in social isolation."

If people keep proclaiming they are entitled to make others sick by their very selfish behavior, then of course there are going to be more closings.

There will be no full opening of the economy until we all do the sensible thing, and this includes Trump.

Our governor is very susceptible to that faction and so are our legislators, many of whom are running businesses. So don't try to take away their rice bowl even in a pandemic - even for a month.  And the truth is that a more thoughtful, careful opening with more restrictions could have been manageable. But now our cases are over 6000 and deaths are increasing and hospitalizations are increasing rapidly. We have hot spots in Myrtle Beach and Greenville and they are imminent in Columbia and Clemson. And a portion of our population just doesn't care and doesn't want their lives interfered with no matter what. Even the so-called institutions of higher learning are seeking the almighty buck asap by reopening to students in the Fall. God save us everyone."
2020-06-24 17:09,"What is so hard and complicated about wearing masks?  A single order for everyone to wear masks at all times in public would save so much of the economy; any inconvenience or costs associated with it would be nothing next to the economic losses from shutting down.

Look at Seoul and Toyko; neither South Korea nor Japan ever had anything close to full shutdowns, and the select events, institutions, or areas that did shut down are nothing compared to the shutdowns in the US.  Tokyo is a far larger and far more dense city than New York.  Yet all of Japan has under 1000 deaths and all of South Korea under 300, as of today.  What is the biggest difference? Mask wearing from the outset.

The governor of Texas won't order people to wear masks, but then tells them to stay home as much as possible.  So it's not really accurate to say that people like him value the economy over public health.  He values neither.  He could save the economy if people wore masks."

By contrast, look at China, with comprehensive testing and tracing infrastructure in place, universal health care, and life returning to normal.

2020-06-24 17:23,"The idea that this virus can be brought under control is a fallacy. Looking to other countries that seemingly did so and opened is a timing issue, as those countries will not last long with low infections opened up. The only thing we should be focused on managing are hospitalization rates. And given that the virus is a tenth as likely to hospitalize it’s victims as we thought three months ago, we have a very different challenge than we initially thought. Masks and hand washing will prove to be sufficient to limit transmission in an open economy enough to keep hospitalizations under control. And that will bear itself out clearly in places like California in the coming couple of weeks. We will also see dramatically reduced death rates both due to treatments and better screening at nursing homes. I wish the NYT would be more thoughtful is it’s coverage. Because fearful readers feed off of fearful stories to use the fear as a coping mechanism. Leading to probability neglect where the percentages of lethality no longer matter to a frightened readership. So many readers hyper focus on the number of dead and insist on assuming that trend will continue. But all the medical professionals agree that mortality rates are coming way down."

So now we have states with huge surges (and probably increased death rates a month or so from now) such as Texas, Florida, Georgia. What do they have in common- large, virtually uncontrolled protesters in Houston, Miami, Atlanta. And for those who say outside is really safe? I point you to the Sept.28 1918 Liberty Bond March in Philly that led to over a thousand deaths the following two weeks. Want something more current? The first big spike out of China occurred in Lombardy, Italy. It was precipitated by the Champions League Match in Milan on Feb 19, a match now referred to as ""Game Zero"" because that is what set off the pandemic in Italy. And yes, it was played outside. Yes, masks help, but when you have screaming, yelling, socially non-distanced people in tight quarters, you have disease.

Dr Fauci, your leading medical expert, says the states with  accelerating infections have two weeks, just two weeks before the virus is out of control in about 7 states.
So if nothing changes fundamentally in the social and public health management of the crisis, which I expect it won't, all these states will be in the position New York was in. The hospitals and morgues will be overwhelmed. The health workers will be stressed beyond coping. At that point governors will have to re-impose lockdowns until the hospitals can get a handle on the numbers again.
So July/August will be a nightmare for those states.

The solution would seem to be to make wearing masks in indoor public places, and crowded outdoor public places, mandatory not only in terms of law, but also in terms of a social norm and social expectation.  The very idea that wearing a mask, or not wearing one, would be regarded as some sort of statement on political ideology, or masculinity, or bravery, or toughness, or freedom, is just childish and insipid.

Imagine, just imagine, if President Trump for once decided to do something decent and helpful and responsible and emblematic of true leadership:  go on TV and talk up the benefits of wearing masks, and then wear one himself when he's out and about.  Maybe his die-hard supporters, who in many cases hang on his every word and feverishly obey his every pronouncement, would listen, and we could get this virus under control.

And most businesses just go through  the motions, doing the minimum they can get away with intheir particular state. Business models and commercial rents are built around crowding customers into confined spaces. 

If we need disaster aid till it's safe to be ""normal"" again, we need disaster aid.

How were they able to sign contracts - including the one needed to purchase deadly weapons - and hold jobs when they cannot even read? Very puzzling indeed."
2020-06-24 17:44,"I wonder if those so-called conservatives who are advocating for peoples’ freedom are also advocating for people’ freedom not to be infected by other people who spread the virus?

2020-06-24 17:42,"In 2016 when unhappy voters said they didn't like their choices for president and in the end it wouldn't make any difference who was elected, do they see the difference now? We have a leaderless, rudderless Executive Branch pinballing from one issue to another, solving none of the problems facing us. We are still in the first wave of a pandemic and Trump choses to go to Oklahoma and Arizona, two hot spots, to hold campaign rallies. The attendees were packed into enclosed spaces with no masks, listening to the president of the United States lie about the ""great"" job he is doing to test, treat, and eradicate covid-19. If in November we do not retire him and the complicit Republicans in Congress who have enabled him, we will see the end of the great democratic experiment."
2020-06-24 17:37,"If Americans want to return to work, they are going to have to wear masks and socially distance.

Otherwise, we're back to lockdowns."
2020-06-24 17:44,"Trump's poor crisis management has led to all of this. Does the government think that by reopening right away will solve all our problems? Don't they think that trying to solve a problem will cause another problem? I dread this grim idea of coming back to work especially the commuting aspect of it. I heavily rely on public transit and I'm terrified with present scenario of people failing to abide to the safety measures. We may have slowed down our infection/mortality rates here in NYC, but it looks like we are confronted by a floodgate that is waiting for destruction. Employers only look after their businesses, and we are truly considered as a 'statistic' here."
2020-06-24 17:45,"More than 2.4 million infected, 123,000 deaths by far more than any other country in the world. Deeply in debt and deeply divided. Mile long food lines everywhere. Our country used to be admired and envied now they pity us. That is Trump's America."
2020-06-24 17:50,"The problem is not easing restriction.  The problem is easing restriction without a plan to monitor and control the spread of COVID-19.  

If we want the ""freedom"" of no/reduced restriction, we must be willing to wear a mask and cooperate with contact tracing; and the government must foot the bill for frequent periodic COVID-19 testing in workplace."
2020-06-24 17:58,"So what is the plan and/or goal?  Stated goal was to flatten the curve so time was available to build up hospital and hospital surge capacity as well as adequate protection for health care providers.  That appears to be in place.  Now, it feels like the goal posts are being moved to prevent illness and/or deaths ""just a few more months"" in hopes of a vaccine that may or may not come shortly.  The only number that truly counts is the hospital capacity. Sitting around wasting time on the number of deaths is silly.  COVID is not a terrorist act, act of war, or unnatural occurrence.  It's part of nature. There is enough observational data now as to which individuals present the highest risk of hospitalization.  A solid predictive model can be built using real-world data. Create a risk score for risk of hospitalization:  age, obesity, hypertension, diabetes, blood type, general health status.  Score 0-3 = low risk, 4-7 = medium risk and 8-10 = high risk.  Require every COVID test administered to capture the appropriate data.  10,000 positive cases with people in the low risk category - no worries.  8,000 medium risk and 2,000 high risk - start getting the hospitals on notice.  Track and trend the data.  The deaths are a backward looking statistic and only confirm that that person will not be using hospital capacity again."
2020-06-24 18:06,"If we (and NYT) were honest with ourselves, the recent increases in Covid-19 cases are attributable to a number of factors, including premature re-opening, mixed messages on masks, and protests. The combination of these factors may be different from state to state. But unless we are clear-eyed about what behaviors and policies are driving the increase and are prepared to deal with them in a consistent manner, we are not going to be able to mitigate the epidemic."
2020-06-24 18:14,"The best advice would be to wear masks in public when you are waiting on line to get into a store, a public facility, or when you can't maintain a physical distance of 6 feet between yourself and someone outside your family.  Wash your hands often.  Wear gloves if you are grocery shopping.  

Last piece of advice, be patient.  And send emails or call your representatives in DC telling them that we pay their salaries and expect them to do their jobs helping the country and that country means us, all of us."
2020-06-24 18:19,"A particularly interesting aspect of the trend in cases of Covid19 and deaths is the tremendous divergence. Infections had plateaued and now are increasing somewhat, while deaths have continuously decreased. It seems that there are two likely causes. (1) With our increased testing, we are now picking up many more mild and moderate cases that are not of concern to the infected individual. (2) Our treatment of those with severe disease has improved dramatically. For example, the recognition that Covid19 is as much a vascular disease as it is a lung disease."
2020-06-24 19:16,"I had thought that a reluctance to travel (abroad or withing the US) derives from our concern over safety on the plane and at airports. 

I now think that there is an equal (if not greater) risk that traveling carries the substantial risk of quarantines being put into place upon arrival or return. 

I could protect myself sufficiently during a plane ride to/from TX, for instance, but I can't control the behaviors of the people of TX (or PA/NJ) and therefore I can't risk state policy maker's sudden changes of heart. 

There is too much uncertainty about population behaviors far from one's own. You won't catch me on a plane until there is an effective vaccine."
2020-06-24 19:18,"""With guidance from governments hard to pin down, the burden of deciding whether to stay open or shut down again ... is falling on individual businesses.""

And on individuals, on whether to patronize those that are open.  ""Safe"" is not a word to use for any business under these circumstances -- it's more accurately a matter of how well the risk is managed.  Since so many of our government entities at all levels have abrogated responsibility, we're on our own to assess the risk.  Remember in November!"
2020-06-24 19:28,"We're going to handle this the way we handle public transportation - good in a few places, but for the rest - bad service that lurches along."
2020-06-24 17:49,"You don't cure a virus or stop its killing people by pretending it's old news that will soon go away. Nor does it work to only go through the motions of limiting its spread, as most stateas are currently doing. Kinda sorta keeping six feet away from each other, except when we need to get by, of course, and mostly but not always remembering to put on a mask, but meaning to (or not), doesn't cut it. Businesses just aren't set up to operate with people roaming wide open spaces far away from each other, and commercial rents reflect the implicit need to crowd people in.

We are simply not set up to ""reopen"" much of America without killing many more people, a disproportionate share of them African-American and/or elderly. We know this will happen; we're doing it anyway.

You also don't defeat a virus by pretending it's sent to you by politicians, who can make it appear or disappear at will, rather than by (take your pick) God or nature.  Politicians can't very well ""liberate"" anyone from a  virus that is rampant by pretending it doesn't exist or is going away on its own. Perhaps the pleas for ""liberation"" should be sent to God, if one is a believer, and/or by supporting the scientists and epidemiologists who are now fighting nature at its worst."
2020-06-24 19:16,"Please explain why checking temperatures  at stores or work places should be a meaningful, let alone reassuring method for monitoring potential Covid cases. By the time fever hits, the person could have been shedding virus for days. 

My normal temperature is 97 degrees. I start to feel mildly to moderately ill at 98.6 and It I go over 99, I usually feel awful. 

In contrast, a relative’s normal temperature is 99  to  100degrees. Has been for years and she’s healthy, runs regularly, doesn’t feel ill till her temp goes over 101.2-and even then, generally only mildly  sick,if at all. . 

Point being : there is no single “ normal “ or “ one size fits all” temperature . Amd by the time temperatures go up , a person  likely been shedding virus for days.will all those with “ abnormal” temperatures be tested?  Or simply tir ed away at the door?"
2020-06-24 18:20,"We can put a man on the moon but we cannot handle this. We have a strategy for each state. And then a strategy for each county within a state. Then another strategy for cities within the county. What an unforgivable mess. We close the economy down, then open it up too soon. Now we'll close things down again, probably. People are getting sick, and people will die. No federal guidance, no federal anything. This is not the America I understood to be great, this is not the America I grew up admiring. We are Third World."
2020-06-24 19:31,"Where's the miraculous disappearance of the virus that Trump promised us would happen?

2020-06-24 18:11,"The pictures accompanying this story show the problem:  the refusal to wear a mask.  Two guys walk past a masked employee, past a sign saying to wear a mask, and go into a store without masks on.  We need to wear masks or Covid will be with us for a long time."
2020-06-24 18:00,"There must be total complete shutdown, otherwise community spread continues to grow and this nation will see death on an unprecedented scale not seen since 1918.  In addition, wearing a mask is not political statement, but a public health statement. Because Americans are in denial and federal leadership is nonexistent, many many more will die before attitudes change. The question is how many deaths are enough before Americans decide to sacrifice their selfish, greedy and convenient behaviors for the good of the country - 150K, 200K, 300K, 500K, 750K  +1 million deaths?"
2020-06-24 18:30,"Yeah, you think? The day after bars were allowed to reopen here in LA, I saw packed patios with NO ONE wearing masks. No amount of pleading on the part of experts and elected officials will prevent this. We will all be pulled down by the Lowest Common Denominators."
2020-06-24 18:08,"Bungling as far as the eye can see. In most places and on many levels, this has gone on for months. The virus has been been having a field day in this country, and it's far from over--au contraire.

It's wrong to blame incompetent leaders though. People have elected their governments and officials, be it by voting or by abstaining from voting. They also make their personal choices every day. It's a bit like supporting the NRA while also keeping a gun in your closet. If you make poor choices, there will be a cost. The sad thing is that more reasonable and prudent people often have to pay a price for your actions as well."

2020-06-24 19:14,"It is way past time for Fauci and any other legitimate health care professional working under Trump  to quit and start shooting from the hip regarding the disastrous interference the current administration is running in the fight against this disaster, and join with states in an ad hoc national alliance to save our health and our economy (someone like Bill Gates or the equivalent would be someone to head it).  It is time for everyone, including the press, to just totally ignore Trump and the Republicans when it comes to the pandemic.

Continuing to work with him and/or listen to him and the Republicans is just blind or cowardly collaboration, plain and simple."
2020-06-24 18:46,"It is expected that the virus would surge as lockdowns are lifted.  The lockdowns do not allow immunity to develop.  

It is nonetheless probably not appropriate to indefinitely maintain draconian lockdowns.  They are doing substantial harm.  The collapse in the global economy has caused widespread hunger and starvation. Vaccination for preventable diseases are on hold. The US has become  dependent of foreign manufacturing for many essential products and supplies.  Most of our medicines come from China.

Thus, the benefits of lockdowns must be weighed against their costs, which are great.  The good news is that medical treatment of Covid has improved, at the death rates are, so far, on the decline.  This may, of course, change.

Only a vaccine will allow a return to normal.  Unfortunately, there was very bad news in vaccine development yesterday.  A Missouri state court upheld a $2 billion jury verdict against Johnson and Johnson over allegations that baby powder causes cancer.  Most likely, this verdict is based on juror sympathy for sick (or deceased) patients, but the science is likely junk science.  There are literally 19,000  more suits pending, do the math and your talking many trillions of dolllars.

J&J is a major vaccine developer and manufacturer.  Whatever readers may think about big pharmaceutical firms, right now they are essential to developing and manufacturing an effective vaccine.

Given the crisis, the US badly needs Congress to pass tort reform."
2020-06-24 18:11,"The failure to control covid-19 is directly related to the haphazard regionally regulated initial shut down. If it had been properly carried out, the levels of existing virus in the community at large would have been driven down to a manageable situation. The Trump administration, in its effort to pretend there was no problem, in the failure to provide guidance, and leadership by example, has caused the situation to be far worse than it should have been. Ironically, the very concern and focus on the damage a shut down does to the economy, by limiting the shut down, and by not doing it properly, will end up causing even great economic damage."
2020-06-24 17:50,"The payoff from incompetent political leadership. If ordinary folks had been persuaded regarding dangers and protective measures early on and if they saw leaders including clergy, sports and entertainment celebrities wearing masks and acting responsibly, then this would not be so totally out of control. 
What was so difficult about no mask/no entry?"
2020-06-24 18:54,"In a weird way, Mother Nature is warning us and giving us a chance to hit the re-set button on how we do things, especially regarding global climate change, which has a direct bearing on our health and the health of the planet.  Do we really want to go back to the way things were before COVID-19?"
2020-06-24 18:54,"Leave it to Trump to make the simple act of wearing a mask an us vs. them issue.  He couldn't resist, even though fewer cases would have helped his re-election prospects.  

Dr. Faucci noticed this aspect of Trump's nature and he's made a preemptive strike, saying when a vaccine is found, it must be tested extensively.  You can bet Trump will say the virus is no longer a threat the moment a vaccine candidate shows promise."
2020-06-24 18:55,"Without a coordinated & massive Federal effort (testing, tracing, quarantine), the curve will never flatten and the economy won’t recover.  Unfortunately we’ll have to wait until Jan 20, 2021 for that effort to commence."
2020-06-24 19:19,"It's an open-ended situation, and forget about a vaccine that only half of people take, or only works some of the time. At some point discretion needs to be vested back with the people."
2020-06-24 17:58,"When people say that they find wearing masks unnecessary and too constraining etc.etc.,  I always think back to the public safety campaign on television many years ago to convince feckless drivers and passengers that they needed to wear seat belts in cars. In one sequence a young man says that he doesn’t  want to buckle up because seat belts limit his movements- it was followed by an image of the young man in a full body cast with arms and one leg in traction on a hospital bed after a car accident without a seatbelt. Very effective campaign. 

Maybe those who find wearing a mask just too much of a nuisance need to try to picture themselves or their loved ones intubated on a hospital ventilator!"
2020-06-24 18:59,"What this proves (or should prove at the very least) is that we had (repeat had) managed to bring the caseload down through protective measures, but that didn't mean by any stretch of the imagination that the disease 'magically' (to use a certain orange-faced person's word) disappeared.  Even as states might open up, it's essential that everyone remember to be responsible to one another.  Wearing PPE and keeping distances isn't about personal liberty.  It's about whether a person has respect for those around him/her - about whether that person respects the liberties and lives of those around him/her.  Far too often we couch abuse, distrust, violations of dignity, religious bigotry, and various other prejudices behind personal 'liberty'.  Such an attitude is NOT liberty, it's license."
2020-06-24 18:00,"We dare not disturb Trump as he corrals the republican party into helping him achieve his biggest bankruptcy yet - the United States of America.  Month after month wasted with rosy predictions that were proved false before they were even uttered, time we could have used to implement a national plan for containment of the virus and a rational return to work.  Instead, republicans have overseen the worst Covid response in the entire world (YAY we're number 1!!!) and now, again,  we are forced into mass infection, isolation and economic devastation.  Trump and his troglodyte followers have taken a great nation and driven it to its knees.  Let's hopefully, thankfully, finally rid ourselves of this Trumplican stain and (wait for it) make America great again."
2020-06-24 20:42,"As a country we have failed the Covid 19 test.  The U.S. has accumulated more cases and deaths than any other nation, despite the fact that we account for only 5% of the world's population.  The total lack of leadership at the top has prevented us from testing adequately, having standardized contact tracing and even issuing firm guidelines to follow.  We are such an outlier that the E.U. is seriously considering prohibiting Americans from traveling to their member nations.  In watching scenes across the country where large groups are gathering with no regard for the potential spread of the virus, it begs the question are we really this clueless?  The answer as a country at this moment is a disappointing yes."
2020-06-24 20:21,"I'm old enough to remember when seat-belts started coming in, but they still weren't standard equipment. As a high-school teenager in the early 60s, I paid hard-earned cash to have seat-belts retro-fitted to my car. I got the idea because the San Diego PD was doing the same.

People said I was fool because, ""It was always safer to be thrown clear in a accident.""  I always asked, ""Was it better to be thrown clear through the windshield or out a side window?""

They probably would have also turned down a mask."
2020-06-24 17:58,"""""Morally responsible"" are two words not in everyone's vocabulary.  And for many people, those two words are beyond their ability to reason  that slowing down the virus means to stick to guidelines.   ""Instant gratification"" however, seems to be the rule where states jumped to appease Trump in opening too early.   Trump does not even want to be bothered with any virus issues any more.  When you are more worried about the statues of losers than humans, shows you what is in his heart.  Or does he even have one?"
2020-06-24 18:26,"as a new yorker, it saddens me to see how few ppl are masking in these photos. around here, everyone masks, not just because of policy but because we all know how deadly & insidious this virus is. we lived it. 

we know so many who have been sick. we all know a few who have died. we remember the haunting sirens that seemed they would never quiet. we watched each day, with dread, as the numbers ticked up and up and up. 

what these unmasked ppl don't realize is that, like new yorkers, they will all be wearing masks before the end of Covid. many didn't learn from our experience. so now unfortunately they will have to learn from their experience."

2020-06-24 19:41,The sad part is that it would have been possible to reopen a lot of places safely if the process had been managed properly.

Looks like he forgot about that- it guess it is much easier to distract and spend all day watching TV and blasting people on twitter.

But we hardly know all it will do - scans of asymptomatic people who never knew they had COVID show lung damage - damage that should heal - but damage - and we don't even know yet everywhere this disease causes damage and what - as a clotting issue it affects the entire body. 

I find it funny that some are worried about side effects of a hypothetical vaccine that was approved too quickly (and with good cause) - but act like a virus from the wild, where there is no testing at all to establish it's 'safety' is something that they're willing to risk."

2020-06-24 20:00,"As restaurants and businesses open with varying health protocols, I’m seeing a slow but steady increase in risk-taking among even friends with extra vulnerabilities.  

I hear rationalizing like “the chances I’ll die are really low even if I get it”,  even though the growing evidence shows dire health effects of Covid 19 among patients who survive.  

With re-opening, we now must decide how much pre-Covid normalcy is safe in light of statistics showing the virus remains virulent.  Many I know are torn yet often pulled to re-engage in “normal” activities, increasing risk to all of us.

Employers who demand employees work despite continuing health risks also increase the risks of more infections in their communities.  

I blame political leaders of all stripes for undermining public health in this pandemic, but Republicans in office (starting of course with Trump) are pure villains in facilitating reckless re-opening policies.  Now they even want to stop testing! 

My family hears the siren songs of malls and restaurants, but we’re resisting.  Even so, as those around us take more risks, risks to us increase as well."
2020-06-24 19:34,"We must adjust to this new normal. No brainers:
1) Wear mask in any indoor or crowded place
2) Wash hands
3) Physical distance from anyone not in your household, or if cases are down in your area, a very small ""bubble"" with agreed-upon boundaries.
4) Worker protection--SPACE for employees to do their jobs. Ventilation. Etc.
5) Gatherings of more than 25 people should be banned for the foreseeable future, except possibly for school, and children in school should be in pods of 25 to limit outbreaks, with masks worn outside of pod (perhaps in too). Could be good for rethinking education and making it more personal at levels beyond elementary school. Not sure how this would work for middle/high school but I bet there's a way. Maybe teachers rotate instead of students, or you do English class for a whole week and then science the next week. Etc. 
6) Prevalence testing--check for covid in sewage by quantity and/or use randomized testing to catch outbreaks early.

We already see that states which thought themselves virus-proof (“I don’t see anyone getting sick”, “sickness is only for the old”), could only believe this as long as there was a lockdown, and because, yes, there was limited testing.

Cases in those states grew with early reopening, few precautions, while more testing gave us a better picture of reality. Former hotspots like NY and MA drove down numbers not because of less testing (there the same level of increased testing as well), but because of continued precautions; their relative success can be just as easily be undone, but at least most residents recognize the necessity for them, seeing the fruit of their labors.

If it can no longer be denied that the virus is everywhere, then the protests and complaints about liberty vs communism are puerile behavior in the name of ideology (where it has no place in public health, but you can’t convince them of this) and totally self-defeating, achieving neither a return to ‘normal’, nor protecting their health.

No one masked, everyone packed together and celebrating their freedom of choice.  Well, now they have an outbreak and a ever growing collection of top tennis players testing positive, spreading it throughout the world no doubt.  Djokovic is sorry.  

I do not imagine that Trump would ever admit being sorry that any of his mindless fans are made ill by the novel coronavirus.

2020-06-24 22:11,"The suffering, the spread of the virus, the death count, are all the direct result of policy decisions by (what I call) the ruling elite. 

This could have been handled much more differently, better. First, the federal government should have instituted a (temporary) universal basic income, for as long as necessary, whether 6 months, 12, months, 18 months, etc. Second, a robust testing, tracking, and quarantine policy should have been put in place everywhere.

These policies, if followed, would have allowed us to do two important things: safely-reopened certain economic sectors, and give health authorities and researchers enough time to come up with an effective vaccine/treatment/cure.

And here's the kicker: by implementing these policies the U.S. economy (and society) would have been in a much better position once this public health crisis was overcome.

Instead what we have are 40-plus million people unemployed, a rapacious billionaire class cashing in, having increased their wealth by over $500 billion dollars in a few months, and millions of businesses, dreams, and livelihoods destroyed.

For those asking, ""How do we pay for a temporary UBI?"", the answer is simple. You can find it in Econ 101 textbooks: sovereign governments have full control of money printing presses. We could have gone back to ""business as usual,"" i.e., Wall Street chicanery, once the crisis subsided."

It seems to me that's critical data to know, but at least in this state, I haven't found it published."
2020-06-24 14:56,"Of course there is an upsurge in Coronavirus cases: The circumstances regarding it have not changed an iota since March when we all went into lockdown.  We have no cure, vaccine or treatment.  The decision to reopen is based solely on the arbitrary dates on the calendar and the  desire to call it good and get on with our lives.

The disease doesn't care what we want, it will only continue to do what it does- Infect many and kill quite a few."
2020-06-24 14:56,"When are we going to realize that we can’t continue our eternal economic growth without killing our planet outright?  If we used our present contraction to permanently downsize our growth expectations, the Earth might actually start to flourish again."
2020-06-24 14:53,"Everyday the NYT shows the number of cases rising and deaths falling, a seeming paradox. The answer is that increased testing and increasing infections are occurring among young people who are, in many cases, ignoring the guidelines for safety. Their infections are almost always asymptomatic or mild, not lethal. Vulnerables,by and large, remain cautious and vulnerable. The opening up of America is irreversible."
2020-06-24 14:55,“This is about saving lives. It’s about reopening our businesses. And it’s about showing respect and care for one another.” What Governor Inslee stated is what everyone in this country should be saying. Trump's statement on Saturday and what he still defends is an outrage. He's proven he's unfit for the office he holds.
2020-06-24 14:47,"Just the other day, Vice President Pence stated, “We are winning the fight against the invisible enemy.”

If that's their idea of ""winning"" I shudder to think what losing looks like."
2020-06-24 14:55,"I tend to take the optimistic view that we are finally testing to the level that more advanced countries (yes) were, a month into the thing. That's probably going to be a sign of a slow down, as more people learn that they have it and are forced to self-quarantine. This is not to excuse the trump admins egregious response."
2020-06-24 15:04,"There are areas where people are more conscientious about social distancing and mask wearing and there are areas where people aren’t. There are people here who see wearing a mask as an affront to their personal liberties and constitutional rights. I routinely see people in the grocery store who are not wearing their masks correctly and have their noses and/ or mouths exposed. We have experienced crowds of people at beaches and parks since Memorial Day weekend. We had large protests over the killing of George Floyd. People are out and about and traveling more. 
CA is a state of 40 million people who have very different lives, backgrounds, beliefs and opinions. We’re not just farm workers and hippies. Some of us believe COVID-19 is serious and some of us don’t.
I think it’s fair to say the one thing we all have in common is missing how things were pre-COVID. Some of us will continue to social distance and take precautions and some of us won’t."
2020-06-24 15:06,Highest number of cases since April.  Europe is mulling a ban on American travelers.  Have we 'transitioned to greatness' yet?
2020-06-24 15:10,"I wish media would stop reporting rising case numbers as reason for alarm; those who refuse to take this virus seriously simply cling to the idea that more cases are a result of more testing.   What needs to be driven home is that the % of people testing positive is rising, and that hospitalizations are as well."
2020-06-24 15:11,"Waves of increases are inevitable. The goal of our policy (or anyone where the infection) has never been to eradicate, but to limit the scale and therefore mitigate the effects. We're not doing a great job (or even a good job), and our results are heterogeneous amongst the states, but I'm quite amused at the surprise the NYT and other commenters seem to show.

My prediction: we will see big increases in states that dodged the initial outbreak, driven by both spread and more universal testing. California, Texas, Florida in particular (already happening). However, our infection-fatality rate will continue to fall because we're testing many more asymptomatic individuals."
2020-06-24 15:12,"""The U.S. just recorded its third-highest total of new cases, as hospitalizations rise in some states.""

These numbers say more than any possible excuse or blame Trump could drum up in his defense.

This is a direct result of a ""leader"" who continues to defy and disbelieve science and medical experts."
2020-06-24 15:20,"I know it’s a dark silver lining, but we need new cases in order to develop a vaccine and therapeutics."
2020-06-24 15:24,"You have to be careful with statistics.  According to John Hopkins University, the number of tests over the last 3 months has risen from near zero to over 500,000 each day.  The number of positive tests each day has been steady at around 20,000-30,000.  The 7-day moving average has declined from over 20% positive to around 5%, an enormous improvement.  However, on June 21st there were 32,983 positive tests, slightly more than the average.  Hence the sky is falling alarms were set off."
2020-06-24 15:28,"Since money seems to mean more to most Republicans than their own families do, we are at the point now where all we can do is protect ourselves individually. 

My husband and I wear masks and disinfect our hands with anti-viral disinfectant every time we go anywhere. We stay home from non-essential activities, and when we do have to be around people, we stay 6 feet apart if at all possible. 

You wouldn't see me at a movie theater, a large gathering, or a rally now - not for anything."
2020-06-24 15:30,"I was born in 1940 and live in various parts of the country during the war years.  I have vivid memories of night time air raid drills during those years, and of the terror I felt in the total darkness required during the drills. My grandmother tried to calm me by closing  the outside shutters and pulling down a black screen over the only window in a small room we went to during the drills.  Then, and only then, would she plug a tiny night light in an outlet near the floor.

My recollection is that the adult fear was not of attack by air, but of an air raid warden detecting a light inside our house. 
 He could, and frequently did,  issue fines to violators of the ""no lights"" rules.  Adults spoke of some violators having been jailed.

We have a COVID epidemic, not a COVID drill.  Yet there is virtually no enforcement of any requirement to wear a face mask in public.  We see photos of crowds of people without masks--none of them have to pay a fine. Apparently death by covid  is not as important as death by bombing.  I don't get it."
2020-06-24 15:33,"People may wonder why the death count is receding while the number of cases in increasing. Dr. Fauci just explained yesterday that the death count is a trailing indicator over new cases

In other words, the incidence of cases can rise while the incidence of death recedes because dying from the disease can come weeks and months later.

The other reason is that more and more the virus is hitting the younger population, most of whom will recover, even though they may suffer lingering effects, in some cases permanently.

It is also a matter of how they record the ""cause of death."" If a person with coronavirus dies and said person also has cancer, they may put down the cause of death as ""cancer.""

So it is not a ""seeming paradox"" at all, just the way this virus works. For now, just bear in mind it is not going away just yet, and do safe practices."
2020-06-24 15:38,"Trump initially held back and recognized the threat far too late due to his ""it's all about me"" mind-set.  Now he is rushing to open up far too early for the same reason: what's good for him is good for the country.  

In both cases he doubled down and bet against reality - but both times, finally, reality won.  His luck has run out.  He's lost his mojo, is losing his base, and will lose the election."
2020-06-24 15:40,"Almost every one of the Trump and Pence predictions on the virus have turned out to be horribly wrong. I won't list them, it would take too long, but people should stop listening to them.
    There are careful ways to open up and then there is the wild west approach of the Trump administration. The very fact that the President is leading the ""don't wear a mask"" culture war is evidence of his failed leadership. Every health expert in the world says that large crowds in indoor arenas without masks and social distancing is a recipe for community spread and increased cases and deaths. Yet our President ignores them and puts his supporters at risk. ""Don't worry, it's safe, but please sign this waiver."" We have some of the worst numbers in the world. We have 5 per cent of the worlds population but we have 20 to 25 percent of the worlds cases and deaths. If we are doing such a great job how do you explain those numbers?"
2020-06-24 15:26,"Perhaps this simple saying will make it plain to our friends in the South and the West as it has been a tough lesson learned here in NYC. ""Six feet apart or six feet under your choice."""
2020-06-24 15:37,Big Media keeps pushing to close the economy down. No way. Never again. We are not putting another three or four million citizens out of work. I think folks should wear masks and if some want to work from home I accept their choice as well. I am in no hurry to go to a crowded event. At the same time no more Fauci-led hysteria and closing businesses .
2020-06-24 15:00,"I think it's pretty clear by now-- until there is a vaccine, mankind will be in a constant state of infection."
2020-06-24 15:25,"Did these cases just randomly start spiking, or could it maybe have something to do with large crowds of people standing shoulder to shoulder and screaming all across the country? I know people said that they had to put themselves at risk in order to protest, but they have also put everyone else at risk. It’s hardly any better than conservatives gathering which I don’t recommend either￼."
2020-06-24 15:35,We have no reason to believe it's not an open-ended situation. No one can stay in their houses for another year.
2020-06-24 15:39,"Given the (non)response of the Trump administration and Republican state Governors, is it totally beyond imagination that they might actually consider this just another way to suppress the vote?  They have been so consistently bad when it come to protecting the public and the nation that this seems not beyond the realm of possibility."
2020-06-24 15:45,"Obviously some state governments, by choosing to take minimal precautions and open up businesses too early, have chosen to have more coronavirus cases.  New York had the worst impact initially, took drastic measures, and now has the lowest incidence of the virus in any state.  So New York showed how to handle this, if states follow our example they should be able to reduce the cases again.

It's clear to everybody except Trump supporters that this virus will continue to be a problem until a vaccine is in widespread use, which should be happening in the first half of 2021.  Until then, we need to keep practicing safety measures that will reduce the spread.

Whatever happens, it is also clear that the death toll will not come anywhere near that of the 'Spanish' Flu epidemic, and we survived that as a nation, we'll survive this too.  For people worried about the disastrous effects of this virus, the actual disaster looming is the effects of climate change.  We will get through the virus, and a few years from now it will be having no impact at all, although our economy will probably not get back to booming for about five years, at least."
2020-06-24 15:46,"Among the many alarming things Dr. Fauci and the other panel members said yesterday is that they have not met with President Trump in more than 2 weeks. (Redfield declined a specific answer.)

Trump is AWOL. He has taken the last train for the coast.
He has deserted the American people, who have proven in past crises to be understanding and even forgiving of Presidential errors- eg. Pearl Harbor.

All Trump had to do is marshal his forces and show a modicum or empathy and the American people would support him.
Instead he has effectively disbanded his own task force, muffled the voices of experts, eschewed mask wearing and held contagion fostering rallies.

For this betrayal he is beyond forgiveness."
2020-06-24 15:07,"I generally have a lot of faith in NYT reporting but when I see them grouping Connecticut in the group where cases are “mostly the same” it seems that there is some entrenched desire to see this crisis in the worst light possible. All key metrics (positivity rate, hospitalizations, deaths, cases, etc) have been declining in CT. What gives?"
2020-06-24 15:24,"Funny thing, when you have a disbelieving leader and political party who dismiss science and expertise you can’t fight a pandemic effectively. And that in turn leads to rising cases and a stymied economic recovery. 

We did this to ourselves. Or, more correctly, our ignorant, self absorbed buffoon of a president led the way. Too bad he wasn’t removed for high crimes and misdemeanors when we had the chance. Willful ignorance didn’t spare Congress either."
2020-06-24 14:43,"This is strange: I could swear Trump called coronavirus ""a Democrat hoax, folks"" an assured us that it would ""disappear, just like that, folks"" when the warmer weather arrived. I'm so disappointed to learn that the president lied on both counts."

How many at the rally will come down with the virus (if they haven't already)? Of course, we may never know because they will not go be tested even with symptoms. The Lord & Leader has said they don't need testing. Sorry, I am ready to stay home for as long as it takes or wear a mask so that it becomes automatic when I go out. If they don't care, I do.

We are going to be in crisis mode for a long time, thanks to all of the people who cannot afford to stay home, but are instead being forced to return to work by politicians who cannot bear the notion of paying people to stay at home and be safe. I read yesterday that you need eighty percent of the population to stay at home for ninety days in order to get the virus under control. Texas barely made it through a month without unhinged, suicidal Republicans braying about ""opening up"" the state, and rushing to force people back to work, endangering us all just so the state wouldn't have to keep paying unemployment benefits. These people are terrified of any kind of change whatsoever."

I hope American voters remember that President Trump assured us that this lethal pandemic was a Democrat(ic) hoax.

I'm just gonna keep them closed until November 3rd."
2020-06-24 15:17,"Yes, I expected this. I read a story in the New York Times a few days ago that made it clear that things were about to get worse.

The NYT took its eye off the ball, following the lead of Trump and others."
2020-06-24 15:39,"In Washington, which is roughly the size of Switzerland or New York City, the physical distancing policies were extraordinarily successful. Though the state itself was one of the first hot spots in America, the pandemic was largely stopped in its tracks. In terms of geography, Washington's tale mirrors the narrative for the nation as a whole. The early hot spot was King County (Seattle). The new surge in case counts (and positive test proportions) is coming almost entirely from Yakima County which is a two hour drive away. The Yakima County hospitals are already full. Patients are already being sent to Seattle hospitals. But the worst is yet to come. Typically hospitalization counts lag case counts by several weeks, and death counts lag case counts by three weeks. We will soon see an explosion of hospitalization and death numbers for Yakima County, in line with the present explosion of case numbers. The demographics and politics of Yakima Country are altogether different from those of King County. Because Yakima County was not an early hot spot, they were subject to more liberal reopening policies. In the future such reopening policies must also be contingent on the hypothetical risk associated with demographics and politics. On Friday Inslee will put in a place mandatory mask rules. That is certainly the right thing to do.

Instead, if they carry news about his rally, news about his second term, then they would be taken care off well by Trump administration. Now the ball is in the court of newspapers to decide which news they have to give importance."
2020-06-24 15:11,"But President Trump and Vice President Pence tell us that the rising case numbers are entirely a function of increased testing. That’s like saying that if doctors stopped performing colonoscopies, people would stop getting colon cancer."
2020-06-24 15:18,"What else could go wrong? 

The E.U. and the rest of the world are telling Americans they are not welcome because of our incompetent response to the pandemic and our high infection rates. I can’t blame them, I’d ban us too. 

The ineffectual leadership which entails not only the president but governors and business leaders too, continue to place the economic opening above public safety.  With friends like that who needs enemies!

trump continues to hold rallies and super-spreading events that will ensure that not only his own staff but his base and journalists will get sick, possibly die and certainly spread the disease further. With leaders like this do you feel safe?

Black Lives Matter demonstrations continue and become super-spreading events too. Lack of leadership continues to undermine progress against systemic racism and quell the demonstrations and social unrest. Have you had enough of the social and financial disparities in this country?

Republicans continue their assault on mail-in voting assuring another super-spreader event - Election Day, November 3rd. How is it that a single party can decimate the rule of law and deny individuals their constitutional right to vote?

The judicial branch of the federal government continues its duty to protect and defend the president of the United States. Wait, wasn’t that supposed to be protect and defend the constitution of the US? I think I woke up to a new paradigm this morning."
2020-06-24 15:12,"There are many reasons for this increase, most stem from abject ignorance and incompetence within the White House. However, one of the biggest mistakes was to foretell the future by describing this pandemic as coming in waves, and they still are. People then thought summer would be low-tide, and let their guard down. A better analogy would have been, and remains so, that of a forest fire, with plenty more wood to burn. And we are the wood. America's lack of leadership, coupled with incomprehensible public ignorance, and lack of fortitude, will leave us with another 200,000 dead before year's end.

America's response to this pandemic among leaders and a gullible section of the public (sheep mostly) is akin to raising a white flag after Pearl Harbor. The whole situation shows an appalling level of cowardice - as is the refusal to simply wear a mask, distance, or stay at home, because the baby-in-chief has advertised as much.
Why are these shallow, insecure people so eager to further enhance the ego of a narcissistic ego-maniac? It's so un-American, so weak - or certainly used to be."

Their willful malicious mismanagement of the epidemic and their abandonment of their vow to ""serve and protect"" the lives of their citizens should be reason enough for their removal from office. There can be no more dangerous breach of trust than the thousands of deaths that are on their hands."

A large portion of the blame lies with the media and how it portrays this entirely preventable pandemic. Emotional reactions sell, not rational ones. The media can be blamed for an inexperienced and unfit leader in the White House. The media continues to think only about the bottom line, just ask the FB family. Now imagine if the US and EU had immediately responded by sending significant and meaningful aid to Wuhan, or if either the US or the EU, working in concert, worked to prevent transmission at our airports. Imagine a media asking for these measures. Imagine if the CDC had done its job and asked us to close down in January for only one week, and then demanded liberal testing. Then remember someone you know, who died of COVID 19. Go back further, and imagine a society where tax dollars are spent cleaning public places, cleaning schools and subways. Imagine cities where there is clean air and water. Why is this controversial? Imagine health care for everyone, jobs that allow employees to stay home when ill, schools that have ""sick rooms"" for children at school. The media has failed miserably, especially right wing news. This was preventable, but sadly, pandemics sell."

What does this mean?  Hospitalized WITH the virus or BECAUSE OF the virus.  These are not the same things. You're hospitalizing more people because they delayed basic medical care for 3 months and of course you're resting every new patient so you'll find more positives, aka ""cases"". But they may be asymptomatic. Are they in the ICU or on vents?  If so, how many?  It would be helpful to get granular data, like we had in April.  What are the ages and demographics of these patients. Are they 90 in nursing homes or 40?  If you're filling up ICU beds but only had 3 then that's not a big deal. There's a lot of weaselly omission going on here."

Now, some of the openings that were scheduled have been stopped. My son was scheduled to go back to work next week, but that might be put on hold now, thanks to those who claim it's all a hoax. 

People don't stop to consider how far-reaching their selfish acts can be. Someone's actions can increase the number of infections, which affects a complete stranger's return to work. Even if you think it's ridiculous, wearing a mask is such a small thing to do for others. It is astonishing how many won't do it. Depending on the kindness of strangers is a thing of the past."

One of my colleagues put it best in the meeting - health and safety of faculty, staff and students seem to be secondary concerns - the decision process is being driven by Georgia politics and money. Faculty have been asked to make what I will call ""next of kin"" declarations about who will take our places if one of us becomes ill. That speaks volumes to me. There will be infection and illness. I hope nobody dies."
2020-06-24 16:02,"I studied the map of Coronavirus in the U.S.: Latest Map and Case Count and I think some distinctions should be pointed out.

I looked at the state of Wisconsin and saw three countries that were highlighted in red, indicating a rise in new cases.  

Manitowoc County (population less than 80,000) had 3 new cases and Grant County (population less than 52,000) also had 3 new cases.  

That's it - only 6 new cases in two areas of a combined population of less than 132,000.

I realize that an increase in cases is NOT good news, but I also don't think a wave of panic or fear is warranted either.

Sometimes merely looking at a map may indicate one set of results but in reality, those results can be misleading."

But no. That was too much to expect. He won't be seen in a mask and he howled for ""liberation!"" He is a tedious one-trick pony. All he knows how to do is grandstand and stir up grievance. He cannot think critically. He cannot solve problems. He cannot lead.

There you are.....a patient who listened to Trump. 


What do you do in that case when an Asian doctor ( and there are a LOT of them working in American hospitals) comes in to see you for the three minutes he can alot to you....do you say, in Trumpian fashion:  ""Ah So!!! Do I have Kung Flu????""

This virus is not going away soon. So we have to to live with it for some time like other countries.The governors of some states in the South like Florida, Tennessee, Texas, Oklahoma and Arizona were irresistible and careless.

I've seen people saying that ""most all protesters wore masks."" That's absolutely not true. And if nothing else, these large gatherings seemed to give the rest of the country the go-ahead to get back out there.

I know that the protests are playing a role (and I think it's clear that a fair number of people who are testing positive are refusing to disclose their attendance at those events), but still ... 

It's not that I'm surprised, exactly, but given how many people are now working from home, the decrease in use of public transportation, and that fact that a not insignificant portion of the population actually is being responsible and social distancing, wearing masks, and observing good hygiene, I personally expected the increase in cases to be at least somewhat slower. At this rate, where are we going to be in a month? I don't know the precise answer but it seems to me that we are going to not only have to lock down again, and this time more stringently but also that we may be at a level of infection that starts to seriously compromise things like food supply chains and basic services (public transport, health care, fire departments, law enforcement, etc.)."

Surprise, people aren’t doing it, and now the state is seeing faster Covid growth than before their lockdown, but can’t and won’t do anything about it. There’s no political will. So instead of fighting the disease, the health department is trying in vain to semi-prepare hospitals for what they predict will be a complete and utter disaster of overwhelming cases in the fall. In the meantime, my governor, Jay Inslee, has set a mask order for all public spaces indoor and out. People are griping about it, and some jurisdictions outside the Seattle area won’t enforce it.

The structure of the articles always moves from some new data, to the response of the governor (or other politician), and then to his or her party affiliation.

Seems like a more perfect world would leave ""Republican"" and ""Democrat"" off of those articles, so we could just evaluate the response itself. The fact that Governor Jay Inslee is a Democrat as it relates to his decisions on Covid 19 only means something as a tribal marker. His decisions are what they are."
2020-06-24 16:59,"Amazing the the media, this paper especially,  continues to minimize, actually to ignore the deleterious effects of these protests as individuals traipsed through the streets of various cities spreading the virus with little to no concern for their communities and the weaker ones they would infect. So now we have states with huge surges (and probably increased death rates a month or so from now) such as Texas, Florida, Georgia. What do they have in common- large, virtually uncontrolled protesters in Houston, Miami, Atlanta. And for those who say outside is really safe? I point you to the Sept.28 1918 Liberty Bond March in Philly that led to over a thousand deaths the following two weeks. Want something more current? The first big spike out of China occurred in Lombardy, Italy. It was precipitated by the Champions League Match in Milan on Feb 19, a match now referred to as ""Game Zero"" because that is what set off the pandemic in Italy. And yes, it was played outside. Yes, masks help, but when you have screaming, yelling, socially non-distanced people in tight quarters, you have disease. (NY is an outlier in all of this because their virus spread was exponential early on and mostly exhausted at this point)"

We had talented and capable scientists, and access to unlimited resources, but when the man in charge decided, tragically, to politicize the crisis, the results were, like some of our scientists predicted early on, catastrophic.  Would Trump had acted the same way if this was not an election year?  I believe he would had, because in his complicated narcissist and insecure ways, he always saw the Coronavirus attack as something personal, directed at him by his enemies, remember the early weeks wasted with the political hoax conspiracy."

However it will not be enforced by many sheriffs in republican rural areas. These people have confused public health strategies with constitutional rights. In their minds wearing a mask and losing their 2nd amendment rights is the same. Hopefully businesses will include refusing service to “no shoes, no shirt, no mask” and there will not be associated violence as there was in the beginning. Trump is to blame for all of it. Had he embraced science and encouraged mask wearing - instead of turning it political and about him - we’d be in a different place right now."

When the opening up of businesses is not guided by science from a President who cares only of his re-election, its not just US citizens who should be worried, but the whole world.
A dangerous second wave is also now being warned of in the UK  by leading Doctors, as a result of  our dangerous and grossly incompetent PM.
 Yesterday, Boris Johnson gave a Press Conference, on a day when 171 people died from the virus and new infections are still very high, Johnson was declaring effective victory over the virus by giving widespread permissions for  social distancing to be reduced to approx 3 feet and widespread permission to open up high risk businesses. Since 23rd March 43,000 wholly unnecessary deaths have occurred from COVID-19.
 60,000 excess deaths have been reported by the Governments own statistical department. Further a very recent report prepared by leading epidemiologists  has  estimated that at least 20,000 people of the 43,000 who have died a brutal death, would have survived if the UK lockdown had even occurred 2 weeks earlier.
Johnson , has declared that the job is done and there will be no further Press Conferences, so he can go on holiday. His callousness, just like Trumps is overwhelming.

Vermont is one of those states, and I find that family and friends in neighboring states -- Massachusetts, Connecticut -- as well as those from far away (Washington state) have NO IDEA that Vermont has a two-week quarantine period for all out-of-state travelers. More recently the quarantine rules have been relaxed, but ONLY for those coming from nearby extremely low COVID counties -- and even then only if you arrive by private vehicle.

2020-06-24 16:05,"Focusing on the number of Covid-19 cases is not very informative and helpful because the number of cases tends to depend largely (though not entirely) on the number of tests administered and the size of the population being counted (e.g., city, county, state, country). 

Also, since most countries have come nowhere near testing all of their populations, it is almost certain that every country's number of cases will continue to rise as more and more people are tested.

It is much more informative and useful to doctors, epidemiologists  and policy-makers to know and evaluate the per capita rates of hospitalizations and deaths, which are generally gathered by most jurisdictions but not always reported or easily available to the public. These figures are often shown as X cases or deaths per 10,000 population, or per 100,000 population, which allows apples-to-apples comparisons.

For example, Town A, with a population of 20,000 has 100 cases. Town B, with a population of 50,000, has 200 cases. Clearly, Town B has more cases than Town A but, because Town B is so much larger than Town A its case rate is lower. 

The NYT's own Covid-19 website does an excellent job of gathering and presenting detailed information about case and death counts and rates, but the editorial or headline-writing department keeps using case numbers rather than case rates and death rates.

No question the death rate will be lower in this second phase of the first wave, hopefully a lot lower.  Regardless, some areas of the country will face a dire situation with overflowing hospitals and morgues.  This better be a wake up for everyone to understand how serious the pandemic is; at best, the end is still likely another six to nine months away."

On the contrary, we are moving to an advanced stage of re-opening with limited capacity indoor dining, ditto gyms, zoo, aquarium etc. on Friday.
It's a shame the contrarians down south would rather inflict self-harm than take cues from the liberal states who have the spread of the virus under control."
2020-06-24 15:11,"It just appears to me, that many people think this virus is partisan, so it doesn’t infect them, until it infects either them or someone they love. I’m seeing that in certain governors and people that are making decisions for millions of people they’re supposed to protect. Trump has been negligent throughout this entire pandemic. Telling people to “slow down the testing” because the high numbers are hurting his bid for reelection. What does that tell the country or the states? Sure, reopen businesses too soon? As soon as phase 1 or 2 was announced, people thought the virus was over with. Even though they were told to adhere to requirements for reopening, there were high numbers of people gathering in bars, clubs, even in backyards. Trump has caused more people to die, over 122K, than needed to die! He knows his base is going to follow his lead in how he handled the quarantine, as well as his public display of not wearing a mask or social distancing. His example has led to more people showing disrespect for others health. People refusing to wear a mask when walking down the street, going into food stores, even going for a cup of coffee is just unacceptable. People don’t seem to get it, this virus is nonpartisan, nonracial, nonsectarian. It doesn’t care who you are or what color your skin is. Don’t underestimate this virus! It’s sure death to many more if people don’t listen to the experts! Trump is by far NOT an expert!"

2020-06-24 19:06,"Our solution to the pandemic will be to divide into areas that have the situation under control and areas that dont, and restrict travel between them, either formally or (which could get ugly) informally.  Our principle will be that each area must solve its own problems, and those with the greatest problem cannot export it to areas that are doing better.  

The areas that have not brought the pandemic under control must either live with it or try something else.  To try something else, they must admit that what they are doing is not working and therefore wrong.  In other words, they have to accept the scientific method; their experiment is failing and they have to try something different.    

Those areas that are using the scientific method to get the pandemic under control will wait, protecting themselves from the areas where it is not yet under control, until those areas too adopt the scientific method.   

If these areas have to wait a long time, so be it.  It would be a mistake to use force to save the other areas from their own bad inclinations, because these bad inclinations are what make most of our insoluble problems insoluble.   We tried to save the South from its bad inclination towards slavery but gave up long before the attempt succeeded, and the bad inclination reappeared in other guises and basically won over the country."
2020-06-24 19:06,"I had thought that a reluctance to travel (abroad or withing the US) derives from our concern over safety on the plane and at airports. 

I now think that there is an equal (if not greater) risk that traveling carries the substantial risk of quarantines being put into place upon arrival or return.  I could protect myself sufficiently during a plane ride to/from TX, for instance, but I can't control the behaviors of the people of TX (or PA/NJ) and therefor I can't risk state policy maker's  sudden changes of heart.  

Too much uncertainty about population behaviors far from one's own.  You won't catch me on a plane until there is an effective vaccine."

Most of the country, including my red state, shut down soon after the outbreak hit NY. There were only a handful of cases in my state. Our hospitals were all but closed, restaurants, gyms, schools, everything closed. We remained closed, sacrificing and suffering along with NY, yet we had almost NO cases.

2020-06-24 18:06,"GOP blaming Hispanics for spike in Covid cases.

Farmworker advocates called Ron DeSantis’ comments “shameful” after he said “overwhelmingly Hispanic” laborers were spreading the disease.

DeSantis, who was one of the last governors in the nation to issue a statewide stay-at-home order and one of the first to reopen the economy.

Despite criticism and calls for him to stop heavily censoring records, Gov. Ron DeSantis has decided to keep the public in the dark about several coronavirus public interest issues. It’s a misguided move designed to control information — and the messaging on how the pandemic is impacting the state.

What’s the governor afraid of?    That the public would see these victims in their full humanity, that we would feel for them, that we would learn that their deaths could’ve been avoided if only we had reacted sooner, informed them better, revealed data at a more urgent pace than in droplets at a time?"
2020-06-24 18:12,"Republicans think of the virus as a hoax, and at best an over-estimate; that all business should go back to normal with everything opened up.  Privately, they view the pandemic's victims as overwhelmingly old, indigent, Blacks, and Hispanics (i.e., not them).  Hence, they just want all the people back to work so that their economic survival and prosperity is assured. Why wouldn't they?  They feel immune.

So here is the downside of a democracy; i.e., tyranny of the majority when the majority is wrong.  Dangerously wrong.  And the minority is clueless, disunited, dis-organized, and disinterested in voting.

I wonder what it would be like if we plain abandoned all caution and see where the chips land.  What are the long term economic consequences?  Fatalities will skyrocket but I suspect the economy will boom.  Out of necessity, factories mushroom all across America without labor (automated, robotized); driverless trucks will spread rapidly.  All paperwork will go online.  Maybe 40% of current jobs will disappear, and produce new jobs for the educated, smart set.  

Republicans are betting on: ""I will survive this, so I will be rich."" Democrats?  Little other than soft whining."

There is no question that policing in the United States needs some critical improvements (we have know this for a long time), but the fact that the media (this publication included) has failed to report thoroughly on the connections between the protests and the uptick in infections is concerning to say the least. Other than the fact that protests generally take place outside, they are rather obvious breeding grounds for infection: protests are typically large, very close gatherings with ample vocalization -- Covid-19 spreads with shouting, chanting, etc. The op-eds in this paper have included hardly a word. (if at all?) suggesting the prudence of waiting to tackle these issues until our public health crisis is under control."

But oh no, donald Trump had to make it political. In my state, once Governor Baker fully grasped the severity of our transmission rates we stayed in lockdown longer than many other states. Our reopening phases has been gradual, following carefully phased in dates for different categories of business and community care, keeping an eye on data to ensure we don't have to reimpose greater safety measures.

MA has the lowest transmission rates in the country but if numbers spiked, I'm sure Baker would respond.

He could have been a force for good.
Instead he has been a force for ignorance and death and he must pay the penalties of his inaction and lack of leadership at the polls in the next election.

Because people like me who have real medical risks of Covid-19 complications will NOT be returning to our past lives for a long time, at least until there is a vaccine or very good treatments for the virus. If those of us who are disabled, immunocompromised, elderly or who have other underlying health conditions do not feel reasonably safe from infection, why would we risk our health and lives for a restaurant meal or unnecessary shopping or anything else not essential to health and life? Seeing people not practicing social distancing or wearing masks, like the tourists from Texas, Colorado and Arizona currently cavorting in downtown Santa Fe, is appalling, and reinforces my desire to stay away from those people.

But now seeing the consequences of his actions, the more than 120,000 and counting, the drop of more than 8 % in the economy that is projected, his own actions like not wearing a mask and mocking those who do claiming that they only do it to hurt him and his public statements about ordering a reduction in the number of tests  I realize that there is a point there, that it may be true.

The US national government has very little control over its states, regarding health policy, so even in the best of times, coordinating an effective response would be difficult.  But having an incompetent president in denial about COVID 19 clearly worsens the problem considerably.   Add to that the divided nature or American politics, a state in which we can barely agree on anything, let alone how to address such a daunting task, and we face an almost-impossible situation.  
I don't politicians, even those in blue states where people have been more open to regulation, restarting the stay-at-home orders.  One could blame Trump for having such a childish reaction to the pandemic.  But let's face it: Americans just don't like having people tell them what to do.  That tendency has morphed into a general distrust of experts among large swaths of Americans, mainly Trump supporters.
We are in for a rough road.  And realizing that the EU is likely going to block US travelers because of COVID 19 and our inability to stem its spread is embarrassing.  We are become a third world country.  Another result of Trump.  The irony of ""Make American Great Again"" is rich."

What we don't recognize is what we don't see or even hear about, and that is government/public health action. (If you're an orphan, do you even know what parents are?) 

I have yet to hear a plan of action from the Task Force or the CDC. I only hear different recommendations for what WE need to do. To date, I've only heard two statements of what is necessary and neither of them are from our government. One was stated by Dr. Larry Brilliant, the epidemiologist influential in eradicating small pox, on Amanpour & Co. last week: he said comprehensive testing and contact tracing are essential to know who to isolate/quarantine; this allows the rest of us to leave our houses and support the economy. The second iteration is from Dr. Michael Ryan of WHO, and is printed above. Per Ryan, unless we can figure out who needs to isolate/quarantine, further lock downs will be necessary. 

So if you don't like what's happening, keep masking and social distancing because that's all we can do, but recognize we are as orphans without the wisdom and powers of parents."

But in public spaces, on bike trails, during Bicycle Sundays, very little in the way of wearing masks or keeping a distance.  

If the highest levels of our leadership (the Current Occupant of the White House) cannot be bothered to inconvenience themselves by wearing masks in public, are pressuring states to re-open too soon, and don't want to provide any financial support to working/newly unemployed Americans, what are we supposed to think?  

Over 100K people have died because this administration did nothing but bloviate.  If this is what the GOP and Trump consider successful leadership I'd hate to see what they call a failure to lead.  Hint:  it's not Obama or anyone in his administration who failed.  The failure sits on Trump's shoulders and in McConnell's lap.  I didn't sign a waiver absolving our government of responsibility when Trump took office.  Nor did anyone else.  Maybe we should sue our government for criminal negligence on this."

Shutting down the economy en mass has led to millions of unemployed which are now a threat to the nation itself.  The thought that the largest problem the US has at this point is Covid-19, seems short-sighted.  Nations with the number of unemployed and facing severe and continued economic decline, as the US is, need to worry of mass civil unrest on a host of issues.  The US is very much in danger of tearing itself apart.  All is not well, and it's not going to get well any time soon.

The ""very stable genius"" must also think that taking a pregnancy test is what gets a woman pregnant.

Although the protests were not helpful, at least they were outdoors and protesters seemed to wear face masks. New York has been following the CDC guidelines and is bearing the fruit of science based behavior.

the belief that HIV does not cause AIDS, 

that being gay reduces life expectancy, 

that there is a link between abortion and breast cancer, 

and that there is a causal relationship between vaccines and autism.

I have hippie left wing friends who despise Trump but say ""I can't breathe (don't get me started on that one) and it's really bad for me to wear a mask"" and I have right wing friends that say"" it is my right to go out to a bar and not be forced to wear a mask.  If people don't like it they should stay home"". So I do. Sigh. It's going to be a long year."
2020-06-24 21:11,"Reproductive rate is going up in almost 30 states. Almost all are in the south. Rising up again has taken on a whole different meaning. Can't they just quit already with the horrifying legacies? Wear a mask, fellow Americans!"
2020-06-24 22:14,"How exactly Tristate will impose quarantine on people coming from states with high number of new covid cases? This is a serious question. Those travelers will just be asked to self-quarantine, that's all? This is not going to work as people won't be willing to loose income besides vacation days in today's economy.
 I'm concerned because a few of my coworkers booked vacations there in June and July. One of them just came back to work this week after Florida escape."
2020-06-24 21:30,"Republican Governors of Texas and Florida, ""pleading"" and ""begging"" compliance from their citizens, as their cases of COVID overwhelm their states. How about mandatory enforceable orders to wear a mask, socially distance, or be denied entrance into essential businesses?  Fines and misdemeanors for non-compliance? It is that simple.  A little too late. How is all that freedom working out for ya, Texas, and Florida? Good luck with Jacksonville and the Republican National Convention."
2020-06-24 19:15,"In the Town of Yorktown, NY last week it was reported 686 cases and today the map shows an increase to 692 cases. Demographics show this town has many  healthcare professionals and front line workers.  GOP Town Supervisor Matt Slater with his loyal Trump supporters, and GOP Council Members continue to be disingenuous and not utter their leaders name in public.  As coronavirus rages, Republicans still don’t have a plan to give Americans health-care coverage. The town has no hospital and if you do get sick you either have to go to Hudson Valley Hospital in Peekskill which only has 128 beds or neighboring Mt. Kisco to Northern Westchester Hospital that has 245-bed.  Both hospitals are on overload. The local Assembly Member Kevin Bryne who according to his website ""serves as the ranking Minority member on the Health Committee""  is no where to be found. GOP silence is pitiful. Looks like GOP continue to be part of the ""I don't take responsibility"" regime."
2020-06-24 22:31,"Three years and a half years into this nightmare, I cannot help wondering whether, recognizing that the poor, people of color, and urban populations in general are more susceptible to the virus, we are not witnessing Trump incompetence and/or Republican indifference to, or denial of, the pandemic, but rather perhaps their political strategy in response to it. There doesn’t seem to be any limit to how low they are willing to go to maintain their hegemony."
2020-06-24 11:40,"What everybody here and from each other news outlets seem to have forgotten: EU travelers can't come the the USA either. The government of the USA has made no move to allow European travelers to come in.
Europe is opening up for EU travel while within the EU the virus got under control for the moment. Outside of the EU in other countries the virus seems to be contained as well- visitors of these countries are welcome for the moment.
The USA is far away from getting the virus under control."
2020-06-24 19:14,Trump's supporting rate among the coronavirus: 100%.
2020-06-24 20:01,"And what was the president doing on Tuesday? Well, he flew to Arizona to check on the progress (or lack thereof) of his beloved wall. And then he gave a speech  before 3,000 attendees (who weren't social distancing and most weren't wearing masks) where he spoke of being unable to comprehend the variety of names given to the pandemic virus (throwing in a few racial slurs to keep the audience engaged). He then went on to speak of the vast potential corruption of the upcoming election if mail-in voting is permitted (of course, no proof given) while ignoring the fact that he and his family votes by mail. Not mentioned was the racial turmoil across the nation, just so you know.  

And,  just to clear the confusion, he also declared he ""wasn't kidding"" when he advised his team to slow down testing for the virus. That's how he spent the day when the nation experienced the third-highest total of new infections."
2020-06-24 20:15,"I can't vote(not a citizen), so this is not a partisan rant. American's seem to have lost their senses, especially those on the left. They have just one goal. Pin anything bad on Trump.
People should use their common sense. If you don't feel safe, don't go out. Nobody is forcing you to. If businesses want to open let them open. It's not on Trump. Sensible people SHOULD wear masks when going out and avoid crowds. While many look forward to the day Trump is gone, Biden frankly does not inspire much confidence. He is inept and I fear even worse."
2020-06-24 21:49,"I think I'm missing something -- Phase 4 is the final phase, but ""Malls, movie theaters and gyms must remain closed."" That would suggest malls, movie theaters, and gyms are closed permanently, which I'm assuming would warrant a substantially bigger headline. If not, when are they reopening?
I'm NOT pressing for them to reopen soon, they're high risk. But I think either this phrasing or this policy is misleading."
2020-06-24 20:35,"Cases are up.

Shut down, sequester, spread out. 

This is how it's going to have to be until we have a cure and a vaccination."

2020-06-24 21:59,"It's easy to just blame the President of Law and Order for this mess (not defending the indefensible - he and his government has played a (BIG) part). 

It had me thinking, how did we end up here? We live in the current age of ""me, myself, and I"". No one can tell me what to do (and what not to do), and I deflect and find reasons to justify my right: government is corrupt; science is hoax; it's the Dems; it's GOP. 

To quote the book that was held by DJT in that faithful photo op, John 15:13 reads: Greater love has no one than this: to lay down one's life for one's friends. Right now, I can see front line health workers putting this in action, literally. What can you and I do, to love our neighbors as ourselves, in the midst of this pandemic crisis? Our future depends on it."
2020-06-24 22:02,"Just look at all those very young persons at Tr's Phoenix stop.  Not a mask in sight.

With the rising figures in AZ, some of them are likely infected.  And right there, they have passed it all around them and then, hours later, at home.  Youth might not be badly affected, but too late for Grandpa and Grandma in a couple of weeks.  And to all their peer's families.  

Which bit of this don't they GET?"
2020-06-24 22:08,"In the light of the current crisis in Brazil and the US, and of the importance of evangelical support to both Mr Bolsonaro and Mr Trump, I'd love this newspaper to thoroughly look into the deleterious influence of evangelic churches on our planet and its population (climate change denial, destruction of nature, extreme capitalism, women and gay rights, covid19 denial and so on). Their conflation of capitalistic greed and fanaticism and their immense ability to influence governments pose a serious threat for us all."
2020-06-24 19:56,"Trump said no need for masks, social distancing, and testing. All while the virus is still raging with no end in sight and no vaccine.

November 3, 2020 cannot arrive soon enough."
2020-06-24 20:14,"The Governors and political leaders in thrall to Trump and his base who are opening their states too fast or hesitating to make masks required are just like Roman Catholic prelates who looked the other way or swept unfortunate evidence under the rug to protect their institution instead of their youth.  We asked of the prelates ""how could you have let itt happen?""  Well we're watching it happen every day in the Red states of this country."
2020-06-24 20:58,"Seems to me if trump want to consider this a ""war"" and he wants to be seen as a ""wartime president"" then he should be tried and punished for war crimes."
2020-06-24 21:32,"What else can I say America, elections have consequences.  Trump didn't start a physical war, but he sure did botch the viral war against Covid-19.  

Next time, hire someone who is at least in it for the betterment of all Americans, not just a certain few."
2020-06-24 21:18,"the Governors of Texas, Arizona and Florida refused to take this virus seriously.  They put commerce ahead of lives initially, and the economic fallout in the end will still be as bad or worse than if they had required a total lockdown.  Now the virus is out of control.  Young people are blowing it off.  People consider anyone taking the virus seriously to be a ""Liberal"".  You can also lay a lot of blame at the feet of Donald Trump because he has refused to take the situation seriously.  Attending the rallies, making fun of masks, calling it by racist names -they all are ways he has shown his followers they should not take necessary precautions.  The part of my state where the virus is thriving is due to local officials again not taking it seriously, and a large farm worker population working in packing sheds and in orchards and vineyards.  Yakima, WA exceeded hospital capacity a few days ago and had to send patients to Seattle.  Irresponsibility is costing lives and more money than if public health officials had been listed to.  Instead Public Health officials are being threatened and vilified.   What this is exposing is the dumbing down of America and our complete disregard for science and common sense."
2020-06-24 19:14,"Those who are following the president have to figure out, eventually, that he's leading them off a cliff. But I don't think they'll act on it, because that would involve admitting that they made a great many mistakes, and that is more than many people can bear."
2020-06-24 19:51,"By his utter failure to respond to this non partisan threat, the venal and incompetent 'leader' has vastly increased the damage from that threat.  Masks and social distancing from day one would have been almost as effective as a vaccine in limiting the rate of spread of the disease.  But no, the Donald didn't see that as in his self interest.  Every expert has said testing helps monitor and control the disease.  But no, the Donald says testing is bad because it makes him look bad.  This Donald character is fundamentally warped.   The US population must do whatever it can to get rid of both plagues, i.e. wear masks and vote."
2020-06-24 20:37,"Why cannot we be like New Zealand or Japan? Good grief. With sensible hygiene practices (cover mouth and nose while in public, keep 6 feet away from strangers, stay home if you feel sick, wash hands frequently with soap and water or hand sanitizer), 4-week sheltering except professions needed to run the society (health care, law enforcement, utilities, groceries, pharmacies, fire prevention, courts, infrastructure repair, military service, gas stations, funeral services), financial assistance for people who miss work, we could have this disease behind us (with regulation of international travel) in 1-2 months.

With rare exceptions, you will not get sick--I repeat, you will not get sick--unless the virus gets to your nose or mouth, most likely by touching an infected person and then touching your nose or mouth.

I realize this is difficult for many people, including those who live in nursing facilities or those who otherwise live in closely spaced arrangements.

But no. The cat's out of the bag. People need their freedom of mobility and socializing. And so it goes: Hospitals crowded, ICUs limited, increased work absenteeism, reduced tax revenues, reduced productivity. 

I ask again: Why cannot we learn from successful countries?"
2020-06-24 22:05,"Had to go for yearly physical. Driving home I notice people I’ve never seen before camping out on sidewalks and intersections.

If I had my way, I’d ship every Republican I could find to Siberia...one way.

First time Trump would be flying coach."
2020-06-24 21:30,"During the pandemic Trump has demonstrated a monumental failure of leadership. He has failed America since the very beginning, and he is failing us today. 

   He hasn't taken any responsibility for dealing with the Coronavirus. He hasn't set up a science based federal policy that would mandate how and when the states could reopen. He hasn't ordered the manufacture and stockpiling of PPE. He hasn't been honest with us. He hasn't even worn a mask.

   When generations look back at this moment, they will be astounded at how poorly the richest nation on earth coped with Covid 19. The United States should have taken the lead in a global response to this global threat. Instead, we've taken the lead in the number of deaths.

   So the question is, why would anyone reward his abysmal response? There's an old adage that we routinely ask when presidents run for reelection, are you better off now than you were four years ago? I'm ready to give Biden a chance."
2020-06-24 20:24,"I once thought the most bizarre thing about Federalism was that one could be executed for murder in 30-some states, but step across a border to a state without the death penalty  and not risk the same fate.  Now, thanks to COVID-19, each state's elected officials get to decide individually how much to endanger both their own constituents and their neighbors, putting that at the top of my bizarre list."
2020-06-24 20:37,"Please, do not come to Utah.
We have a crisis developing here and the ICU beds are filling fast.
The Governor will not order a mask requirement and the Legislature passed legislation that does not allow local entities to have health requirements greater than the State.
All of our National Parks have limited services and Zion and Arches close early on the weekends due to crowds.
The majority here do not wear masks and many do not social distance."
2020-06-24 20:45,"I find it ironic that New York State now seeks to place restrictions on people coming from ""hot spot"" states.

Two months ago, New York was the hot spot state.  When the Governor of Rhode Island sought to place limitations on the unfettered visitation of New Yorkers (then the worst hot spot in the nation), Governor Cuomo bitterly complained about the discrimination against New Yorkers and the Constitutional right of interstate travel.

Funny how things change when the shoe goes to the other foot."
2020-06-24 21:21,"Lives lost to bad leadership.

2020-06-24 22:34,"Coronavirus cases are up and is Mr. Trump doing anything? That is, besides ignoring the opinion of medical professionals? Why has this president not been slapped with dereliction of duty? If this were a ship we'd have another captain in place ready to take command."
2020-06-24 20:36,"I would like to acknowledge our Massachusetts Governor, Republican Charlie Baker, has done a good job of leading this state through the crisis.  It doesn't hurt his efforts that the people of Massachusetts are cooperating with the pandemic guidelines. I am proud to live here.

Please spare us all responses about a Massachusetts Republican being a Democrat anywhere else. He is a Republican in a state where almost everyone else is a Democrat, we (re-)elected and support him."
2020-06-24 20:38,"Look, a pandemic is a one-way transaction, Virus doesn't know what do you think or do, It has own trajectory, in that trajectory we the humans are the intelligent ones, but If we do not act accordingly, we become roadkill."
2020-06-24 21:52,"The ironic thing is that if Trump et al had handled the pandemic like grown-ups he'd probably be a shoe-in for re-election. But as it stands now, I think November 3rd is going to be the most massive repudiation of the Republican Party in history."
2020-06-24 22:02,So what does the NJ and NY quarantine actually mean?  Am I allowed to travel to NJ and stay with family provided I do not go out to any stores?  Does this mean that I arrive and isolate myself from family for 14 days after which I can then be with them?  I wear a mask and only go to stores here in South Carolina when I have to.  I would arrive by car.
2020-06-24 19:35,"The states that are opening up and letting people gather in crowds with no social distancing, face masks and probably not washing their hands, get what they deserve.

The real problem is that it will effect us all in the end."
2020-06-24 22:06,"The Trump Administration wasted the past six months and now the pandemic is out of control and getting worse. In order to get beyond the current dilemma, perhaps the nation should now freeze in place for about three months to allow the virus to burn itself out.  Of course this will be a great challenge.
  However, bold action is now necessary because otherwise the next three months of summer could be rather tragic; and the next winter will arrive in much of the country by late October."
2020-06-24 21:59,"Kind of makes sense. Been about two weeks since the George Floyd riots/ protests/ looting, so I'd expect a bump from just that. Add in all the retail opening, church services and general disregard for 'social distancing' and it's hardly a shock that the number of cases has jumped. Will certainly be interesting to see what happens if/ when exercising our 'rights' ends us back in SIP."
2020-06-24 19:46,"I am still shelted in place, teaching online, and reading a lot. Thanks to NYT for crosswords and other games!  Love the Real Extate and Arts sections. Love to read comments, it's amazing how similar they all are....a select sample of USA population. .
We'll likey have election results--from yesterday---by the fourth of July."
2020-06-24 22:17,Clearly the US has a leadership issue that has effected our ability as a nation to isolate and contain this virus. But it should be noted that some significant part of the population is just fine with our President's magical thinking.  Why are folks so willing to pretend drilling holes in the boat to let the water out is the best way to avoid sinking?
2020-06-24 19:25,"I don't understand these quarantine measures for out-of-state visitors, how is this going to be tracked and enforced when NYS is having issues enforcing basic mask-wearing out in public."
2020-06-24 20:37,"As someone with “underlying conditions,” I see no end in sight to staying home.  With things now opening up, I’ve reached the point where I’m afraid going to my regular doctor’s appointments, but still go because my life depends on it.  On my drive though, I see people eating and drinking at outdoor tables, no masks, no social distancing.  And yet, I’m lucky.  I am not worried about paying rent or feeding my kids.  There are people who have to go to work despite their pre-existing conditions.  Where is the government support?  What’s happening is criminal.  So many lives lost and at risk for what?  The almighty dollar, a political party, and one man’s ego."
2020-06-24 19:26,"The GOP govenors in the south and mid-west must believe in magic, namely that what happened in NYC, NJ, Conn, and the west coast of the US could not happen in their states. So they opened up their world, so their economies could recover, and now this has happened. The result will be a prolonged COVID shutdown with bad economies, or lots more deaths, or both."
2020-06-24 22:34,"My grandma from Maine said when common sense goes, it is over for a country.  Okay Grandma, It's Over for America Now!

If wearing a face mask, social distancing, reliable testing, and contract tracing have shown to reduce the number of covid-19 cases--while not doing these things increases cases and deaths--then why don't we do do these 4 things?  And if people won't do mask-wearing and social distancing voluntarily, then it must be mandated for the health and safety of the community.

Of course, understandably, everyone is in a big hurry to open up businesses and get back to work--which is all the more reason to do the 4 things, which lets businesses know when they need to do more or shut down.

Despite a recent surge in covid cases where we live (many at a meat packing plant), mask-wearing has gone way down.  Most store clerks and workers wear masks, but not the majority of the customers in the thick of a covid surge.

Of course, there is Trump and those Trump supporters who have politicized and polarized taking medical precautions, and thumbed their Trumpian noses at medical information, medical experts, and sound advice for safety of self and others. And some avid Trump fans have even manned their guns at government buildings to threaten state officials for doing the responsible things to try to control the spread.  
Public health officials have reported getting death threats for telling people how to try to reduce the spread of covid-19.

How do we restore common sense?"
2020-06-24 22:08,"WOW!

I just read that the Trump administration will end funding for 13 COVID-19 test sites in five states, including Illinois, at the end of June, arguing their operating model has become inefficient.

I guess that's one way for Trump to juke the stats to lower test results."
2020-06-24 22:13,"A female relative who was accompanying an elderly chronically ill appearing male to an appointment in our large private medical practice, decided to take off her mask after  being screened on entry to our office with temperature check and Covid 19 related health questions. When confronted by our practice manager she declared "" I know my rights and it is a $65,000 fine if you try to force me wear a mask or leave the building"". She was calmly escorted from our facility without further incident. The irony is that she put our own relative at increased risk of catching this disease and death by her selfish actions. People who feel the need to defy these preventative measures for political reasons should think about the health and safety of their loved ones. Even if they believe they are ""magically protected"" from Covid 19 because they voted for Trump."
2020-06-24 22:48,"Remember when the NYTimes ran an op-ed back in March on how to turn the virus recession into a global depression? Remember the warnings against succumbing to pressure to open too early? Well, here we are, folks. Here we are."

His corruption is a whole additional dimension."
2020-06-24 22:46,"Well.

On his inauguration Trump did promise to fix Obama’s plenty and give us American carnage.

By all accounts, he has succeeded:

• Over 130,000 Americans dead
• Over 60 million Americans unemployed
• Over 50 trillion dollars of taxpayers’ moolah disappeared

On top of:
• The US is the laughingstock of the world & now relegated to third world status
• Our allies have been isolated while we cozied up with despots
• Environmental protections discarded

All thanks to Trump and his Republican enablers.

America First — from the bottom."

He has deliberately exceeded his authority by hamstringing the public health orders of officials of the state's most populous cities and counties, in order to pander to Trump and the radical right. He refuses to listen to the advice of one of the nation's most respected epidemiologists right here in Houston, in order to pander to Trump and the radical right."

2020-06-24 23:02,"I presume that as this pandemic continues, people(all) will finally recognize that this national health crisis will not just go away. We must act in ways to restrict the growth in cases. Even the recalcitrant will recognize this fact."
2020-06-24 23:19,"Interesting that Cuomo did not include California in his list of states from which incoming travelers will be quarantined.

The list seems to be mostly red states except for Washington.

I believe that he will have to include California to be consistent after the data from today are known, although a major rise in cases has been known there for weeks.  

Of course, this is also a very large state and will hurt tourism to New York so I am not betting on what he will do."

Trump botched the initial response & now he's 'moved on' to the election holding his dangerous & irresponsible rallies with people packed inside venues with no masks!! He hasn't even met with his C-19 team of Dr. Fauci etc in approx. 3 WEEKS! Now the virus has increased in over 20 states. Trump's behavior is criminal & any of his cult mirroring his behavior are endangering themselves + everyone they have close contact with. Millions of Canadian 'snowbirds' will not be going to southern USA this winter + millions of tourists worldwide won't be visiting USA until a vaccine is available.  
When the 2'nd wave hits it may be worse than the ongoing  1'st wave & the already decimated economy will implode. Even Trump knows this but his irresponsible actions are his idiotic attempt to downplay the continuing danger as he's in complete panic & he has no clue what to do--again."

A united, coordinated, rational approach would have been successful in limiting death and sickness.  Many more Americans would be living today.

People in some of the States have not been happy with various rules set in their States. It is quite understandable that people expect to have their workplaces reopen sooner. It is a terrible situation, when you cannot go to work, and not receiving your pay check. And, you are not able to go about with your daily routine. There has been much debate, whether you should wear a mask, when you are out in the public, practise social distancing, and to follow the hygiene check list. 
What we are learning from this pandemic is that it is left to each one of us to do the right thing, When we take care of ourselves, we are helping others as well.

We are susceptible to fake news and conspiracies because we lack critical thinking. We have appalling gaps in poverty because we lack empathy.

Given all the protests and rioting in California, the spike was bound to happen. The increased case counts are largely in Democratic dominated areas there, so this isn't just a partisan issue. The growth in Texas is in Harris County and other minority heavy Democratic areas. So stop deflecting and address the problem.

By law, we all need to wear seatbelt and there are no one complaining of restricting his or her freedom on not to wear seatbelt!  Seatbelt is not only a protection but also a public health issue. Likewise, COVId-19 is a vehicle which can be quite deadly, so using masks is a way to reduce risk of infection and also to reduce transmission to others.

Our economy is becoming increasingly evaluated based on the Stock Market, which reflects institutional investors' interests not the American people's, 401k's notwithstanding.

I wish I could go out there and help, but again, where do we start? We have a country that is tired of hearing about this. We have people on the streets unattended to dealing with mental/emotional health issues that keep them on the streets; this virus is the last thing they're thinking about.

Anyone doubt that a disproportionate number of those hospitalizations are elderly? Getting the idea? Life must go on and elderly people need to stay out of circulation, period. If the fumbling public health officials would get their heads on straight they would just come out and say it; remove the elderly from all of the statistics and death and hospitalization figures plummet. How about we start acting accordingly. Folks under 60 should wear a mask when distancing is not feasible and go about their business.

This is beyond a bully's ability to accept as pushing the world around is his life.

If we do not have one, then the only recourse is herd immunity.  If that is the case, the sooner the better that we get this out of our way.  So the uptick in cases might be healthy in that sense.

Older and heart diseased people will self-isolate before either a vaccine or herd immunity is apparent.  Everyone else will get the equivalent of a bad case of the flu with the death rate about the same as in a bad flu year for the younger healthy population."

America is the country where having the right to do whatever we want as long as it doesn't harm others defines our character.  This libertarian perspective has two parts:  1) do whatever we want and 2) as long as it doesn't harm others.  Those who think as Americans we can do whatever we want are the ones who ignore public health warnings.  Those who understand the caveat of harming others are the ones who follow public health instructions.  

Based on what we are seeing across America, expecting a country as diverse as ours to interpret freedom the same way is expecting too much.  Sadly, our distrust of government means we will permanently live with the virus and the virus, indifferent to politics, will continue to live within us."
2020-06-25 2:30,"We really truly have no one of any repute running this Pandemic response. Our goal should not be to open the economy because we've not yet ""filled our ICU's""! ICU care is expensive; it cost Millions to spend 3 weeks intubated in an ICU. Is that restaurant you opened for indoor dining clearing enough to pay for that? Those not intubated are still in the hospital; that costs tens of thousands. Who is paying? People lost their health insurance. The GOP is working on eliminating the rest of the ACA at this very moment. 

Americans need to wear masks! Not cloth masks. Medical grade. They need something to stop the spread and to stop them from getting the virus as well. They also need to stay home unless a Million dead Americans is acceptable to everyone. Add to that an economy in the ditch and hundreds of thousands with new chronic illnesses because of Covid19; Dialysis and Chronic Lung disease ain't cheap either.

 This Country is adding insult to injury and beyond. It is infuriating."

In the 1918 pandemic, the government ignored the warnings of the public health officials, shipped sick solders to Europe and spread the contagion across the world. Then there is the Philadelphia Bond Parade that lit the fuse for the explosion of the virus that devastated the city. 

21st Century America is too polarized to come to terms with the pandemic. So unemployment, foreclosures, and economic fallout are going to continue, as the nation ignores the public health crisis, leading up to the November election. The new infection rate, plus deaths begins to create a scenario for Trump that he can use to his advantage, postpone the election. Then what?"

Thank you for your valiant, but surely trump-humiliated, efforts on behalf every American.  You tried hard to save as many lives as possible.

Will you now please quit working for that monster trump, and do so in a conspicuous way that broadly condemns his deep, selfish failure on coronavirus, and ensures his defeat in November so we can get to work on saving what is left of our trump-shattered country?

Please quit.  I said here two months ago that trump would undercut you, and he has.  We're dying in spite of your best work, because you work for a bad man.

Please quit, Drs. Fauci and Birx. It's the best way to save us."

However, if the broad mass of registered Republican party members took their duties as citizens seriously. And if various elected Republican officials carried out their constitutionally defined duties conscientiously, the damage wrought by the Trump administration would have been held to a small fraction of what has really occurred since Trump took office.
Trump is an impaired individual who has been allowed to strut and fret his hour on the stage. The blame should not go to him. He’s a unfortunate fool.
The blame for the mismanagement of the Covid-19 pandemic and all the rest of “Trump’s Follies” truly belongs to the Republican party. They are responsible."

They didn't care when thousands were dying everyday in New York because the people dying were liberals/black/immigrants, not one of them. They don't wear masks because it mainly protects others and not *them*. The Republican party has been hijacked by talk radio and cable personalities that have honed anger and hatred into a political force that goes crueler by the day leaving behind the politicians with the smallest shred of decency that are not willing to toe the line leaving us with a bunch of spineless opportunists, with Donald Trump at the head of the line. They have knowingly done nothing to prevent the spread of the virus among their constituents because they were afraid to go against what Donald Trump is tweeting. 

The only way these people will learn is if they are personally affected so we better hope enough of them suffer so we can go back to fighting the virus as a country."

Americans have no patience, and evidently the patience and belief in science that might control the virus are lacking, so we will have not a 'second wave', but instead a never-ending first wave, a continuing plateau and ramp-up (look at the 'cases' graph) that ends who-knows-where, but badly. ""Reopen the economy"" belongs right next to ""what have you got to lose"" in the pantheon of incredibly stupid statements by ""leadership"" in this country.

If there is a narrative like blue against red states, we will not master the containment of the outbreak. If we listen to scientists and medical professionals, we will eventually contain the pandemic.

After the election, which, hopefully, will lead to a  sound democratic majority and Joe Biden as president, we as a nation must address many economical issues. This cannot be a short term game as this pandemic is actually a chance to address even more dangerous issues as the climate change.

He has isolated science and accountability from his entire administration - instead of using actual leaders to guide he sees them as threats . He is corrupt and everything he does is guided by reelection or malaise.

  Fauci and birx a memory. And trump continues denying masks are effective, fails to grasp or care about the toll this virus will continue to have and mocks it as the wuhan virus and China virus. He is unfit and a criminal and deaths will be on him and the complicit that could have stopped him."

This reflects frustration, I'm sure, but it also has a lot to do with unclear messaging (Trump and DeSantis with masks off) and very bad planning. For instance, establishments can have 50% occupancy (far too many people), mask requirements vary from city to city (some mandate masks in public open spaces, some don't), and people just don't understand.

He’s absolutely right. We aren’t even close to being out of the first one.

It almost seems like all the republican governors we’ve been hearing from got together in a room and decided to use increased testing as the get-out-of-jail-free card of choice when asked why the rates of infection are skyrocketing in their states. 

More testing is good, but that alone is not nearly sufficient to explain the sharp rise of cases across the country. It’s time to stop politicizing common sense, stop the denial, and take responsibility."

Mandatory wearing, distancing makes medical sense, scientific sense, humanitarian sense. Perfect sense."
2020-06-25 7:35,"Can someone explain why having a negative test on, say, Day 5, doesn't mean the quarantine can end right then?

Why is it so difficult to understand these simple facts?"

Could it be as simple as taking a few steps back and re-engaging with one another in a civil and formal way, enjoying the gifts of the sun, sky, grass, sand, water and fresh air?

I appreciate my newfound personal space (in public), enjoy the air of formality when addressing or being addressed by strangers, ""Pardon me"" or ""Thank you.""   

If each person takes responsibility for him or herself by making intelligent and respectful choices to ensure safety first, then the probability of becoming a carrier-spreader of C-19 could be a non-issue.

Was it too short? Was it not thorough enough? I know that I have family members there, who are at home, with kids out of school, wearing masks when they go out, and they go out very little. They have really been on lockdown--more than I ever was here. What the heck is going on over there?

And not to add to the controversy, but in Denmark, where I am at, no one wears masks. I went to the ER and the doctor didn't even have on a mask. It is policy not to wear them here, for multiple reasons. I do NOT promote this, but I think it illustrates that you have to get the lockdown step right, no exceptions. THEN you can proceed with a bold opening up and go from there.

Seriously, you have to get the lockdown right the first time, or it is all wasted. What the HECK is going on in the US?"

Only I understand very well because I had lived like that in my former country, albeit, we did have a small terrace, and I had lived in poverty for the first few years in the US.  When the government and the private contractors failed, these residents took the matters into their own hands and did a great job, just the people in my country united during the WWII and after Chernobyl blew up.

Even when no one is visible, microscopic droplets left by a host can swirl through the air, soon to be driven through gaps at doorjambs by pressure difference and enter apartments along the hall. This happened at Amoy Gardens during SARS in Hong Kong. An outbreak often begins silently, with hosts who do not know they have the virus.

Most buildings lack plans for managing what's become almost inevitable now. How will sickroom apartments be kept isolated from the others, supplied with food, and watched for tenants needing ambulance? Many people live alone without phones, and unattended deaths have occurred in my building.

I'm not young anymore. I've never been charismatic in the way of a neighborhood organizer. I wouldn't want to handle in-person shopping requests and payments.

After experiencing similar infection peaks, the European Union--which has a similar population--now has less than 6,000 new infections/day; we have 30,000 and are climbing again. Since many in the general population won't wear masks, and with ""conservative"" politicians ""re-opening"" their states, people in other countries rightly assume America's not even trying to control the spread of Covid.

That intersects with the fact that police officers in America feel a profound, uncontrollable need to intimidate. 

Since wearing a mask is an expression of concern towards others, cops basically can't wear them without feeling they'll be less scary (that's bad, from their perspective.) They'll also be ostracized and seen as weak by their colleagues.

So sad to see people aren't seeing that wearing a mask is to be courteous to another person (i.e. not spread it to another person)."
2020-06-23 14:03,"Face it. The civic authorities are afraid of the police unions. Mayors and police chiefs want their officers to wear masks, but are fearful of a rebellion if they try to enforce it. The police themselves likely see the wearing of masks as a sign of weakness (as does Trump), and so it goes. This is far too prevalent across the country to be explained by one force's peculiarities. On a grander scale, this also explains why bad cops rarely are driven out by the good ones. They band together to protect their own, and their leaders take the expedient route for fear of starting a war. The tail wags the dog."
2020-06-23 14:07,"Well, if the police care so little about their own lives, the lives of their families, coworkers, friends, and communities, I suppose it explains how they treat the public."
2020-06-23 13:38,"It's pretty disingenuous to keep complaining about the number of people who test positive.  The real issue is how many die and that is steadily declining.

At this point, not wearing masks is probably a good thing.  It's the fastest way to herd immunity."
2020-06-23 13:37,"I am noticing that some N.Y. C. police officers are not wearing masks.  Why?  Don’t they at least  want to protect themselves from infecting each other when they are together?  They, like everyone else, could be infected but asymptomatic.   They could infect civilians too.  The protests are due to law enforcement showing an indifference to human life.  Doesn’t the failure to wear a mask also show indifference?  Please NYPD do the right thing."
2020-06-23 14:36,"This turns any interaction with the police, who are government employees, into a potential death sentence. Not just for the person they interact with, but anyone the infected citizen could come into contact with later.  How is this ok?"
2020-06-23 14:36,"One of the issues around today’s policing in big cities is that law enforcement isn’t in the communities they “serve.”  In Chicago, officers live in clusters in a few neighborhoods on the outskirts. Many officers vote Trump and FOPs support Trump so it’s no surprise when they won’t wear masks when Trump has made public health a political litmus test."
2020-06-23 14:26,"I walked passed a group of officers by Washington Sq. yesterday. Not one of them had on a mask. I said something and they told me to mind my own business.

That attitude, that their work is not inherently my business, is precisely what we're fighting against."
2020-06-23 14:42,"It's not just cops. I work for a university and literally none of our student athletes or athletic staff have been wearing masks. After the third email to HR about unsafe work environments I've given up.

I hooe every last Trump supporter loses a loved one to the Virus. That's what it will take. Until they personally have to face the worst case situation they cannot be made to care."
2020-06-23 14:09,"It bothers me when any group works hard to reinforce negative stereotypes about themselves.  So, here are police officers, already under attack for a lack of compassion and a disregard for rules of conduct not even being able to protect themselves and the citizens they are sworn to serve.  And they wonder at the growing cynicism."
2020-06-23 14:37,"I live on the block with the 13th precinct in NYC. Both ends of the block have been barricaded for weeks. To get home I’m sometimes asked to show ID or aggressively ‘tested’ about what building I live in. I have to pass through a gauntlet of sometimes up to 10 cops leaning against the barricade. None are wearing masks, nor do they move 6 ft. aside to let me by. When there is a protest nearby, the volume of cops on the block swells. Again: zero masks. It’s shocking that they show so little regard for the lives of the people who live on their block. My husband politely asked one officer lounging against the barricade what the NYPD policy is on mask-wearing. He replied that there is no policy and “we have other things to worry about”. Other things to worry about than the lives of your hundreds of neighbors?"
2020-06-23 14:28,"Many do not wear masks because they do not know anyone who's had covid-19, or, if they have, there have been no serious consequences. Ergo, simple logic says, why inconvenience yourself by wearing a mask?
Mask-wearing will increase only if covid-19 hits more people closer to home with serious results. Like cigarette smoking or the Vietnam War. Then people will be more amenable to wearing masks.
Like so much of life in this covid-19 world, we'll just have to wait and see what happens. Nobody knows. In the meantime, life goes on. Sorta."
2020-06-23 14:17,"San Francisco, where I live, and where everybody is required (or at least told to wear masks by the mayor’s office), is yet another American city where police offers often don’t wear them. 

A week or so ago, in the days after George Floyd was killed, I saw upwards of 20 police officers standing around downtown in groups of three to six, not two feet between one officer and the next. Not one of them had a mask on. 

There’s a phone number you can call to make a formal complaint. I called it, and, upon request, sent the photos I’d taken to the personal email address of the office I spoke to. Don’t know what happened after that. 

When you see police officers ignoring a) the law, b) the well-being of citizens, c) the oath they took (to protect), and d) what should be common sense, it makes your blood boil. 

We used to call them pigs for a reason (although there’s nothing wrong with the animal so named).

I encourage all of us to protest the non-masked police officer—peacefully."
2020-06-23 14:41,"So much for ""serve and protect"".

These individuals are disrespecting their communities and putting themselves above the law - which is exactly the reason for these protests.

I see a slew of justifications for not doing so, but at the end of the day I say hypocritical."

2020-06-23 15:05,"At the protest I attended, every single person wore a mask...the next day, in the course of 4 blocks, I saw 26 police officers. I counted because I was appalled at the police presence, but I also noticed not one was wearing a mask. Second protest, not all protestors were as good at wearing masks, but the majority were. Not a single police officer I saw was wearing one. So the organization that wants to convince us they're here for our safety isn't bothering to protect themselves or us from pandemic."
2020-06-23 15:07,"BTW: When I went to look up how much bulletproof vests weigh, the first site I went to had the following banner across the top:  ""Due to unprecedented amount of orders, we are experiencing 30 business days lead time on armor products.""
I guess we all need to ""gear up."""
2020-06-23 15:44,"In every business I can think of, an employee who refused to follow a safety rule would be fired. 

When they refuse to wear masks, the police are sending a signal that they don't have to follow orders."
2020-06-23 15:46,Have the police just become a protection racket?  Lawless and answerable to no one?
2020-06-23 15:01,"I understand that journalists don't do cultural analysis, but it doesn't take a semiotician to recognize that the police officers who have been declining to wear masks are signaling to the protesters and the world at large that they intend to conduct themselves as they always have and will flout any novel regulations established to protect the public."
2020-06-23 15:05,"More Trump carnage. 

Chaos at any cost is fully supported by the Republican party"
2020-06-23 15:35,"125 shootings during the first two weeks of June, 52 on Father's Day alone, and no mention of it in the NYT. Yet what do we get, another hit piece on the NYPD. Don't worry about the masks, the message has been sent by the spineless politicians that cops should stay far away from the public. They don't act, they're wrong, the act and the politicians throw them right under the bus. 9,000 calls about fireworks so far this month and Eric Adams response to citizens is ""don't call 911 or 311"" talk to them about how dangerous fireworks are. Good, police don't want to get involved anyway. It's only June 23 and a about a month since NYC completely made it known they hate police. By August the carnage will make 1977 look like a cakewalk. Just create a Seattle CHOP zone and all will be well. You asked for this no police utopia, enjoy."
2020-06-23 15:43,"A mask shows a person who cares about others.
No mask reveals those who care only about themselves."
2020-06-23 15:44,"Mask wearing as a political football is just plain stupid.
Went food shopping yesterday, me and my mask...on the way out, a gentleman sneezed (reminds me of a great episode from the tv show Raymond); I was so glad he had a mask on.  
We do well when we protect each other instead of doing what's easy; wearing a mask is not easy or pleasant, but it's better than the alternative.
It is amazing that police don't do more to protect themselves health wise and reputation wise ...a culture that demands respect because it shows respect and responsibility.   Protecting abusers in the ranks does not speak well of the police in general.
Those who wish to see big change should emulate the police departments that have done it already..like Camden NJ..if the media info is correct.  Learn from the best and listen to the people.  How hard is that?"
2020-06-23 15:01,"Have you ever seen cops drive? At least in LA, they regularly roll through stop signs and blow through traffic lights when not on calls. Many don’t think they need to follow basic laws they’d write tickets for civilians for breaking."
2020-06-23 15:34,"Personally, I think the cops want to get sick so they can blame protestors.  They will do literally anything to paint themselves as victims."
2020-06-23 15:58,This is another reason to defund police departments and curtail police unions. They act as vigilantes. They aren’t protecting citizens equally.  They could be SPREADING the virus.
2020-06-23 14:58,"Well, some of the institutional police at the place I work won't wear masks even in buildings. What am I going to do, arrest them?"
2020-06-23 15:12,"Any police not wearing masks are advertising their level of irresponsibility and, possibly, their politics. They might be an essential part of needed changes as they cull themselves out of the herd."
2020-06-23 15:25,"This perfectly sums up the attitude of the police in America, they are above the law and the rules that apply to you and me do not apply to them."
2020-06-23 14:58,"Walking down the street, I've seen lots of police officers without masks.  I guess they think pandemics don't apply to them.  Or the law. 

With that type of attitude, I don't think this epidemic will end any time soon.  At least not here.  The rest of the world can move on, while we will continue to have spike after spike."
2020-06-23 14:59,Sounds like the cops are tired of being told how to do their jobs … a feeling they could avoid by admitting that significant numbers of them don’t actually know how to do their jobs.
2020-06-23 15:27,Why aren't they wearing masks? Do they know something we don't know.?  99% of the police we have seen around the city are not wearing masks even though at the height of this for NYC many police officers were out sick and members have died from the virus. Do they test every day? Its hard to imagine that's it's just indifference to their own safety.
2020-06-23 15:52,"A good friend of mine is a nurse in the ICU at a major Las Vegas hospital. Driving to work one recent morning for an early shift, she was stopped by a Las Vegas police for turning left on a red arrow (no traffic coming, 5 am in the morning). She was wearing her scrubs, immediately put on her mask, and watched as the officer approached her car. As he admonished her for the turn, she told him he really should be wearing a mask. He said he doesn't need one because his encounters with the public are low risk. She notified him that she works at a hospital that is treating COVID patients, and that just by talking with her, he was at risk. He just shrugged and let her off with a warning."
2020-06-23 15:00,If they're going to absorb mass amounts of public money they should have to follow the rules. Seems pretty basic.
2020-06-23 16:22,"The masks that the public wears -- including the protesting public -- are to protect others from the virus they might have.  That includes protecting the police they might come in contact with.

On the other hand, the masks that the police wear -- or should be wearing -- are for the purpose of protecting the public (including protestors) they are supposed to be protecting.

Thus, the police who are not wearing masks are failing in their primordial mission of protecting and serving the public."
2020-06-23 13:25,"Wearing a mask is so basic. How can we respect our police when they continue to defy orders and endanger the very people they are supposed to protect. And why are the politicians so afraid of confronting this cultural issue. Do they believe that some real disicpline  will turn the city into a crime ridden inferno? Maybe they are thinking about themselves.
The solution is simple, no mask, you stay home with no pay for a day. Try it out."
2020-06-23 13:34,"Having a badge or a Criminal Justice degree does not mean one has any functional knowledge of Public Heath or epidemiology.  Bullets (metal or otherwise), clubs, flash bangs, tear, gas, APCs are all useless tools against a strand of RNA Virus.  Nor, can you look at it sternly with the confidence of knowing you have an array of deadly weapons to impose ones will upon it.  

Dickens stated the problem clearly nearly 175 years ago:

Excerpt:
""This boy is Ignorance. This girl is Want. Beware them both,
and all of their degree, but most of all beware this boy,
for on his brow I see that written which is Doom, unless the
writing be erased. Deny it.' cried the Spirit, stretching out
its hand towards the city. 'Slander those who tell it ye.
Admit it for your factious purposes, and make it worse.
And abide the end.' ""

We have apparently traveled no further, only changed the date on the calendar to suit our precious egos."
2020-06-23 14:33,"Here in NYC I’m tempted to contact the police when I see an officer actually wearing a mask to commend that officer. Haven’t had a reason to call yet...

Kind of reminds me of Judge Dredd, “I do not break the law, I am the law!”"
2020-06-23 14:56,"How can the NYTIMES only now be reporting on this? It's evident that a large portion of NYTIMES reporters are out of NYC right now and it's shameful that they aren't bothering to provide better coverage of events on the ground in the city. Streets are still closed off around precincts. The responses Shea gave during the AG hearing were shameful. Where is the coverage? Really. So so so disappointing that the times is leaving reporting on all this to hardworking but smaller local news orgs. The times is being outreported by NYPOST on the burglaries and Gothamist on all that's happening with the NYPD. This mask issue has been brought up for weeks including when the NYPD lied about the situation to the face of the city council during the public safety committee hearing. 
Do better."
2020-06-23 16:11,"Police officers around the nation have had money and assistance showered on them, but now they openly disregard their departmental rules and common-sense steps to protect themselves and the population from Covid-19.

Is the racism and arrogance of these officers so ingrained that they will sacrifice their own safety and and the safety of the people they are sworn to protect just to make a point? 

The law enforcement personnel have gone crazy."
2020-06-23 16:16,If the police don't follow the rules why should the citizens?
2020-06-23 16:22,"So we're going to beat the police up for this too?!  It is summer out there folks.  These are largely middle age men and women doing a job that is sometimes physical.  I job slowly in the nice cool evenings, and it is brutal.  

These folks protect you.  Everytime they get in a confrontation, they have no way of knowing if there is going to be a gun or a knife involved.  They are not sitting on a sofa eating bon bons and watching the video after it has been filmed and we all know the outcome.  They do not know the outcome, and they have to be prepared for anything.  

I am utterly sick of my fellows in the nice comfortable middle class criticizing police for absolutely everything, when the critics themselves could not themselves do the job.  And no, I did not vote for Trump and never will, but if we all keep this up, I can tell you right now that many, many people who have real jobs will.  I do not have such a job, but I respect those who do.  Show some respect, please, please, please."
2020-06-23 16:00,The name Trump is conspicuously absent from this article. Many of these officers are plainly signaling their identification with him.
2020-06-23 16:04,"From other many images of other news agencies, they reveal the police force did wear mask. I believe the public have to understand that the policemen sacrifice their safety for the public and the citizens protection. They need to face unprecedented violence, injury and fatalities everyday. The policemen expressed the health concern in meetings or reports. However, they have to fulfill their duties and allow agile chasing and legit apprehension. There is one reason that they can be seen without masks. Guess what. They are forced to let themselves be seen and their health risk appeases unreasonable rumors and falsified accusations against them."
2020-06-23 16:05,"Police officers should ask themselves why they follow a code, written or not and yet allow themselves to be swayed by another's rampant egoism to the point of placing his/her own and their family's lives at risk?

  Those law enforcement leaders that endorse/encourage such foolhardy behaviour, who refuse to protect the lives of the men and women in their command should have that honor stripped."
2020-06-23 16:09,"We first saw this before the George Floyd/BLM protests, when armed, unmasked ""re-open protestors"" were seen screaming in the (unmasked) faces of police in Michigan.

Also, the excuse that there are shortages of supplies doesn't mean they can't wear a bandana or other covering.  Anything is better than nothing.  Most of the public is doing that, since high-grade masks are not readily available."
2020-06-23 16:20,Further proof the police think they’re above the law. The Police are supposed to protect the public. Act like it.
2020-06-23 16:06,"On the day after Cambridge, MA instituted a mandatory face mask order (supposedly with a fine for non compliance) I walked past two police officers within two feet of each other chatting and 'laughing it up'. Neither were wearing masks. I felt like saying something but knowing the response I would get (certainly not an,  'Oh, I'm sorry. Thanks for reminding me') I kept walking. Maybe I shouldn't have."

They are not the same."
2020-06-23 16:38,"Not only do they not wear masks, but they feel it's their duty as parents to expose their own children to the virus.   Cops support guns, and everything you can tie to guns is where they stand."
2020-06-23 16:52,"Looking at the photo at the top of the article, the officers are wearing visors.  If you have a visor, you really don't need a face mask.  There is little evidence to suggest the vaccine transmits well outdoors.  Not wearing a mask outside seems pretty reasonable behaviour.  People are very keen on self-righteous indignation - how about some rationality instead?"
2020-06-23 16:57,"I'm a 56 year old white man living in New York City and have been frustrated, confused, and enraged by the lack of respect shown by NYPD specifically. While I've seen the Port Authority police and other branches of the police force consitently wearing masks, the NYPD I've encountered almost seem to mock the requirement; tying them to a belt loop, shoving them in a pocket. They couldn't even be bothered to wear them as the disturbingly popular passive aggressive baby blue chin strap. I've never interacted with law enforcement in my 30 plus years living in NYC so was frustrated enough to go up to a group of officers. They were huddled together, chatting, not wearing masks on the edge of Washington Square Park after a peaceful protest was making its way west. I approached one officer and asked if I could ask him a question. He scowled at me and said ""yeah"" so I inquired as to why they weren't wearing masks. Without looking me in the eye, he curtly and dismissively said ""because it's not a law"". I responded by asking whether he thought it was ok to disrespect me even though the governor and police commission required officers to wear masks. With utter disdain, he said he wasn't invading my space so why was I invading his. Confused by his aggressive deflection - I was more than six feet away from him and we were in a public park - I walked away. Here I thought the police are there to serve and protect me when, in fact, this particular encounter tells me they could care less."
2020-06-23 16:58,"Police officers are gods that deserve more respect than the rest of us lowly citizens. Why should they have to wear masks, stop at red lights, park legally, or use a turn signal like the rest of us?"
2020-06-23 16:26,"I have met quite a few police casually over the years. I'm a white, working class guy and I felt unsafe and and uneasy around almost all of them. The job seems to attract or create unstable hotheads that are not able to do the things we ask them to do."
2020-06-23 16:35,"This is partly due to the generally short attention span of Americans, as well as our impatience and denialism of unpleasant facts.

It's also due to cops' resistance to doing what's expected of them by society, to their macho posturing, as well as their broad support for trump-- a man who has eschewed mask wearing and whose supporters see masks as a facial flag of liberalism.

In any case, they should be FORCED to wear masks. This should not be optional."
2020-06-23 16:51,"How many mask-less officers are female vs. male? 
Regardless of what 45 says, one doesn't lose one's manhood by protecting other people via wearing a mask."

2020-06-23 17:03,"Police officers who themselves defy the law, and perhaps especially sound public health orders, immediately should be placed on unpaid leave and/or issued the $1,000 per incident fine most orders allow.  

Police are supposed to be a positive example of lawfulness and of PROTECTing the people and communities they are paid to serve.  

Flouting personal and public health safety measures that have the weight of law is a poor choice of civil disobedience on their part and trivializes & makes a mockery of those (hopefully) rare times when an officer is issued a truly unlawful/unethical order and must decide to put it aside.

Finally, We the People, through our tax payments and special assessments, provide these police officers with their salaries, healthcare & other benefits, equipment & stations & our good will, respect, and general obedience.  Do they really want to further alienate us, the tax payers who ultimately determine not just their salaries & benefits, but also the size of the force (as in how much backup they might have available when in the hottest of situations), & other critically important features of their work?

In the current covid-19 pandemic circumstances, officers refusing to wear properly fitted & functioning face masks IS a form of potentially deadly police misconduct. Asymptomatic or barely symptomatic cops refusing to wear masks may not be knee-vicing our necks, but they’re threatening to compromise our ability to breathe in a more insidious ways: germs."
2020-06-23 16:36,"The police are a macho authoritarian culture. Mask wearing is a (small) self sacrifice of comfort for a greater good. Is anyone in doubt as to why there is so little mask wearing amongst the police? 
Donald Trump immediately decided to ‘pick a side’ instead of working for the unity of humanity on the issue of systemic racism. He picked the police not the protesters as his team. Donald Trump refuses to wear a mask, and by his  repeated actions ridiculed mask wearing. Is it any wonder the President’s chosen team is not wearing masks? My guess would be not wearing a mask is a sign of bravado at this point amongst the police, a defiance of those seeking to curtail their perceived entitled rights and privileges. It’s like skins versus shirts on the streets with the protestors. At this point I would guess the peer pressure on any officer choosing to not  wear a mask would be extreme.
  To serve and protect is a great pr slogan but it’s actually a very hard row to hoe consistently. Way easier to go with the blue brotherhood."
2020-06-23 17:28,"Law enforcement often acts above the law, never for the greater good of the citizens they are allegedly protecting. This is just one of the things I and millions of others have been protesting against for the last month.

2020-06-23 17:35,What hypocrisy.  When protestors don't wear masks they are defended because police brutality allegedly is a health issue.  When police officers wear shields or cover their faces they are criticized for looking too militaristic.  When they don't wear masks they are criticized for being reckless.   We get it.  Whatever the police do these days is wrong because the whole concept of a police department is now deemed to be wrong.  Good luck with that argument.
2020-06-23 17:33,"It seems it would legal to ignore and move away from the demands of a police officer without a mask, as being near one would threaten one’s life. Of course, ignoring them will threaten one’s life as well, so it’s a catch-22."

Todd Trayer, a police spokesman, noting that both types of masks cannot be effective if worn simultaneously.""     Liar or ignorant?  Come on Lt. Trayer,  the police gas mask will filter out equal to or better than an N95 mask.   This is just another example of the bogus blue line.  Please stop defending officer and department inadequacies."
2020-06-23 17:24,"I find it strange that the focus of this article was on police officers not wearing cloth masks--a practice with scant evidence of efficacy at best--while ignoring the part where the San Jose cops couldn't wear masks because they were more concerned about swapping into gas masks while tear gassing people--a practice known to harm humans.

Mask-wearing continues to be a ""partisan"" issue. If you believe that science shows truth, let's have a population-level scientific experiment that shows mask use reduces viral spread and settle it. There is no such evidence; I have read every study cited by the CDC and WHO, and they are all either bad lab studies, syllogistic mathematical modeling exercises, or retrospective garbage rife with statistical snafus that wouldn't pass snuff in a sociology journal. So I'd say let's focus on the things that we know with certainty are horrible, like the dystopian police state in which we are living."
2020-06-23 17:44,"So cops (whom this family usually respect and trust and support) will wear masks to protect themselves from the teargas and smoke bombs they inflict on peaceful demonstrators of late, but they won’t wear a simple surgical mask to help protect themselves, their families, their fellow officers, or the public they are sworn to protect (protect!!)?

And before they claim such masks make it too hard to breathe when worn for hours, they might consider the fact that the doctors and nurses who spend up to 12-15 hours operating on them and their partners when things go south and a cop gets shot, hit/run over by a vehicle, injured in a blast or bad fall, etc. — those surgeons and nurses and techs wear the same kinds of masks and are on their feet and doing physical labor the entire time the cop is in their O.R. and under their knife, with no complaints about impeded breathing by surgeons and staff.

If cops want us to not cough or sneeze into their gunshot or surgical wounds or spread spittle while we talk during surgery or bandage changes, perhaps they should accord us and our families and neighbors the same common-sense, no sweat off your back courtesy by keeping masks on when on the job and whenever off he job but in public.

Cops and others refusing to wear masks or take other infection control measures seriously make out work as healthcare providers much more difficult and much more dangerous for us (given we are the ones who have to face surges of covid infection at close range)."
2020-06-23 17:50,I have often seen officers in NY near Union Square without masks. When I recently approached 4 of them who were standing close together they said they were  only required  to put masks on when interracting with the public (while ignoring the interraction with me.)
2020-06-23 17:09,"Al those deaths, and people who have been seriously ill and will experience live long effects of having had Covid-19.
Cases are surging in the USA.
In those circumstances if even the US police no longer feels like they should wear masks, that is depressing..."
2020-06-23 17:34,"I suspect the officers who don’t wear masks got the idea from observing the recent media coverage of protesters all across the county, the great majority of whom did NOT wear masks.

The highest percentage of mask-wearers was among the looters, arsonists, rioters and other committing violence, more to hide their identify than to prevent the spread of coronavirus."

2020-06-23 17:34,"""Some"" officers aren't wearing masks? Literally the only time I've seen NYPD officers in my neighborhood with masks on their persons, those masks have been around their chins or throats. And there's a permanent NYPD mobile unit right down the street, so it's not as though I'm in a somehow un-patrolled area."
2020-06-23 17:43,"I have already made a personal complaint to local law enforcement agency here in Virginia after seeing a vehicle pileup with multiple victims, mostly ambulatory from what I could see, attended by a dozen (I counted) public safety officers on the scene from different dispatches (police, fire, sheriff)—none of whom wore masks. Repeat: none. But they were forcing motorists to interact with them through open windows to get around the wreck. 

I was driving and felt shocked and concerned for the safety of the victims but instantly afraid for my own safety. I was able to turn around immediately without having to interact with these “public safety” authorities and in retrospect, I still think there was no excuse for their behaviour. 

But what was even more shocking was the attitude of the police officer I spoke to when reporting this. He actually tried to mansplain this to me. His condescension was meant to be demeaning but I took it for total arrogance. The force of his argument for why police officers don’t need to wear masks was that they can do what they want, whenever they want, based on criteria that they alone impose on decision making. He did not see his job as an urgent duty to protect citizens from COVID by wearing a mask. Nowhere in our conversation did he acknowledge the first duty of law enforcement and emergency workers is public safety. It was a disheartening conversation, but at least I felt I had done my civic duty to speak up. Those poor people in the accident."
2020-06-23 17:08,"About a week ago, two police officers came to our door to ask about a neighborhood issue. Neither of them wore masks and one definitely did not socially distance. It was disturbing."
2020-06-23 17:10,"Well, of course, some cops refuse to wear masks even though the government whose laws they enforce require people to wear masks.

What else do you expect since cops are above the law?

THAT is the problem.  The problem isn't racism.  Racism is just often the motive.  But the problem is that cops can act on their racism or any other motive with complete impunity.  Cops can have racist views all they please....their thoughts hurt no one....it is only when they act on their racist thoughts that there is harm."
2020-06-23 17:11,"When did ""serve and protect"" become ""unnerve and infect""?"
2020-06-23 17:24,"Also pay attention to this behavior. I've noticed the NYPD officers that don't wear masks are also the same ones who wear ""mourning bands"" that cover their police ID number. These folks don't think they need to answer to anybody. 

The fact that mourning bands have been around for so long and have always been used to cover up badge numbers, should be enough to fire a police officer."

2020-06-23 18:12,"The failure to wear masks is another illustration of police arrogance, exertion of power over the public, and impunity from any accountability.

2020-06-23 18:16,"If only we had competent contact tracing and adequate testing, we might be able to track infections from unmasked officers, and the lawsuits would flow – lawsuits being the only thing the brings any accountability to the police. Barring that, it's possible that a seemingly inevitable outbreak of Covid-19 among law enforcement communities might convince them to take it seriously, but they take their cues from Trump these days and Trump says it's a hoax and masks make them look weak. 

At any rate, given the contempt so many officers have shown in recent weeks toward the people who pay their salaries, you would think they would want to protect themselves from the people they think are beneath them."
2020-06-23 18:16,The problem is there is no one who is willing to order them to wear a mask. They are putting themselves and the public in harms way. If they get sick it is the taxpayer who is on the hook with sick pay and such. Our tough talking Mayor or Governor can't bring themselves to order the cops to wear a mask? How you going to have police reform if you are afraid to ask your cops to wear a mask? Taking a knee sure makes for good press but doing something concrete to reform policing take some steel in your spine. No wonder cops think we work for them. The Mayor is afraid they will turn their backs on him again.
2020-06-23 18:21,"Police wear body armor to protect their torso from bullets. What are the odds of a police officer getting shot? According to the FBI in 2019 48 officers died as a result of felonious acts, presumably most of them being shot. There are more than 800,000 sworn law enforcement officers now serving in the United States. I'm not even counting National Guard and other enforcers being deployed to intimidate peaceful protests and others like the 16 year old pictured in this story who dared defy a curfew. 

What are the odds of a police officer or anyone else transmitting or contracting Covid-19?  Do the math. I bet they are far higher than 48 out of 800,000."
2020-06-23 18:15,"The police are special, just like the military. We should provide them unlimited funding, give them special perks, and treat them with boundless respect. In pre-1914 Germany, civilians had to give way to soldiers on sidewalks. Right now, military personnel get to board airplanes first. Cops should also be given that privilege. That is the only way to ensure that the Republic survives and flourishes."
2020-06-23 17:44,"Too bad if police officers think that it is ""unmanly"" of them to wear a mask. If tRump does not wear a mask, then that should also be good enough for them. 

Maybe they will think twice about it when they catch the coronavirus and get seriously sick .... and maybe even die.   Too bad, but that's their choice. But, at least, they will get paid sick leave."
2020-06-23 18:43,"I love how the Times and most media outlets will point blame at everybody and anybody not wearing masks, but simply refuses to call out the protesters for not wearing masks.  Clearly some were, but a high percentage weren't.  Now here in California most of our new cases are in the 18-40 age group, it's been about two or so weeks after the protests, yet the media is not calling out this connection.  This is precisely the media bias and selective reporting that has become so prevalent in the mainstream media."

2020-06-23 18:35,"It's frightening. Masks prevent disease spread - that is just fact. Police serve and protect their community - that is said to the the policy of our Mayor who is said to be progressive and community-oriented. And the squads of police occurring Greenwich Village over the past several weeks, as others have noted, are consistently un-masked.

I wish it were possible to say something new and unexpected, but we're stuck in a swamp of police misconduct that we have been working hard and consistently to escape, betrayed yet again by so-called leaders."
2020-06-23 18:41,"Masks have become a political symbol for some people.  Some police must have decided that they do not wish to lose their prior privileges and are publicizing the fact. Perhaps they should change that old motto of theirs, to serve and protect, to something more fitting to how they see themselves and their mission."
2020-06-23 19:22,"""They needed to put on gas masks to keep safe while deploying tear gas, said Lt. Todd Trayer, a police spokesman, noting that both types of masks cannot be effective if worn simultaneously.""

This quote shows everything that is wrong with law enforcement in the US. Tear gas should NEVER be used, especially against peaceful protestors. Chicago PD made do without it during the protests, and they're not exactly known for their restraint.

I'm guessing the quote is post-hoc rationalization on the part of the spokesman. Cops are not wearing masks even when things are completely peaceful and calm. It's not surprising considering how overwhelmingly pro-Trump the police are."
2020-06-23 19:29,"Two months ago the police were begging for masks and other ppe. Now they may wear them as a fashion accessory around their necks. Yes, it's frightening and horrifying that they are so recklessly casual about the health of the public, but what else does this mean? What has changed in the beliefs/cognition of these officers?

Masks add a layer of safety to the public during police interactions, but it goes both ways. Do the police believe they are immune to the virus? What about the families of officers? Do the police think their wives, children, partners, etc are all immune? Two months ago they recognized the danger to their families as well as to themselves, maybe even to their colleagues. 

I've always perceived the police as family-oriented, willing to go to any length to protect them. Yet, based on their current behavior, they seem to hold a higher regard for their reputation among colleagues than for the safety of their closest loved ones. If this is indeed the case, then their concern for public safety is clearly so limited as to be negligible. 

If I was related to an officer, he would have to sleep elsewhere while he ""chooses"" to go without a mask. And if there was any validity to the concern of giving clearly, easily understood commands, they would wear face shields instead."
2020-06-23 20:00,"I know the ""broken windows"" form of policing has fallen into disfavor ... and to the extent that it was used to harass racial minorities, that's all well and good. I have mixed feelings about it, because once you say, ""We only issue summonses or even warnings if it's a felony,"" quality of life for what's left of NY's middle class - subway & bus riders, most of us - rapidly declines.

But I'll admit ""that ship has sailed."" STILL, for a police force (the ""brass"" especially, because the stats make them look good), maybe, they should dust it off and apply it to their workforce. I'm sure if a policeman wore an armband with ""B.L.M"" on it, s/he'd be reprimanded and worse.... Do policemen still meet as a group at the beginning of a shift? Are masks optional for them there, too? ... Or do they just take them off when they interact with the public - to show just what a joke CPR (courtesy, professionalism, respect, I think) has become. And it's the furthest thing from a funny joke, of course.

I continue to feel that every video where a NYPD person in uniform has his/her badge willfully covered should result in the forfeiture of vacation time, if nothing more. Use the hi-priced & dubious ""spy tech"" to ID the maskless offenders!

In a quasi-military force - because that IS what it IS - the breakdown of discipline is Hitlerian. diBlasio got a couple of photo-ops bragging about crackdowns, so he's back to ""see no evil"" - so long as the perps are wearing dark blue uniforms."

2020-06-23 21:45,I just returned home today from a minor fender bender. Two police officers and two paramedics showed up to assist. None of them were wearing masks. All of them got way to close to me. I was more rattled about that than the accident. We are in big trouble.
2020-06-23 21:17,"Somewhere, at sometime, someone told the police that they were special, and they believed it."
2020-06-23 21:16,"Donald Trump has said that wearing a mask is showing a willful disrespect for him personally.

Polls consistently show 80 - 90% of police officers are Trump supporters.

By not wearing masks, officers are showing their loyalty to Trump rather than to the safety and well-being of local citizens who they gave an oath to serve and protect (and those citizens are the taxpayers who are paying their salaries).

It's not just police brutality.  By also snubbing their noses at us rather than covering them, it is little wonder the police are losing the respect of an growing number of Americans."
2020-06-24 0:26,"How would those same cops feel if the surgeons and nurses who remove bullets and otherwise put cops back together when they’re injured on the job suddenly refused to wear face masks while operating on them?  

What, they don’t want the surgeon’s germs floating into their wounds?  They don’t want the surgical nurse sneezing or otherwise getting her snot and spittle and germs on the surgical equipment about to go into the cop’s body or into his/her eyes/nose/mouth while under the nurse’s care (read: under her protection, being served by the surgeon)?   Gee, I’d bet the community members with whom those face-mask-eschewing cops interact feel exactly the same way.

Cops & others who may need Emergency Department or other healthcare services:  If you want healthcare professionals to protect you while receiving their services, start by protecting others around you, whom you serve, from your (and their) germs, lest you contribute to a surge in infections or cause or contribute to even one more covid infection — all of which put everyone else, but especially ED and other healthcare workers at significantly higher risk of disease and death.

2020-06-24 1:32,This country is in trouble when the act of wearing a mask is so predictably partisan.
2020-06-24 11:44,NYPD all have masks. This isn't a supply issue. Yesterday at our polling place in Brooklyn there was a cop with no mask at the entrance. The day before that there were 4 inside my local deli with no mask. They want to infect us.
2020-06-24 11:51,"There was a fire at the building next to mine at the end of April. Of the police who showed up, any who were wearing masks were wearing them around their neck. The rest weren’t wearing them. I had to evacuate my building and was uncomfortable the whole time I was standing near them. I had a mask on. 

This isn’t an issue that started after the protests."
2020-06-23 13:30,"It takes a lot of energy to look busy for 40 hours a week. When you can channel that energy into actually accomplishing tasks - however long they actually take - I'm not surprised productivity is up. 

The real shame is that we've spent decades insisting that 40+ hours is the only way to achieve something in this world, regardless of the lessons other developed countries, and our own lived experiences, teach us. 

And no doubt companies will eventually revert to insist on babysitting employees in an office to satisfy their own need for control, micromanagement, and need to feel useful."
2020-06-23 13:36,I normally work remotely from home. The difference that the crisis  has produced is that our team is reduced due to furloughs and those of us left are critical to operation. We have been working all year without time off. I'm stuck at home alone 24/7 with only a few exceptions walking/biking/running errands. I have much reduced social interaction. I could use some time away to drive to visit family in a different state and see friends. To do that I would leave my client without proper coverage due to the reduced workforce. I want to keep my job. How do I take time off due to me during this crisis and remain dutiful to my clients needs?
2020-06-23 13:45,"Much of ""middle management"" is now seen as not very necessary.....if you hire the right people( those that actually do the work), increase incentives, and lightly manage them.....more gets done, morale is higher and you have saved $ on middle management costs.

All the people complaining their productivity is down are the ones who chitchat and use “personal relationship” to show productivity vs. actually producing something. I hear sales team stating that they can’t sell because no wining and dining and no body language. That’s code word for wink wink, nod nod instead of selling and buying what is best for the client. Collaboration can absolutely happen in virtual world, and lets face it most meetings in the name of collaboration are just waste of time."
2020-06-23 13:56,"The mental health impacts of working from home, particularly with children no longer in care, are real. If other employees are high-achieving during quarantine and a parent of young kids finds themselves not measuring up, they work longer and longer hours into the night or morning because they are never away from work. Productivity is therefore up, yes, but I agree it’s only a matter of time before this situation is no longer tenable."
2020-06-23 13:58,"As a business analyst, a portion of my job is to ""spot"" those I know who have the knowledge I need to complete my analysis.

There are knowledge holders who were difficult to tap before COVID and remain difficult to tap now. My strategies have changed, the difficulty remains.

What I have discovered are the more subtle knowledge holders who are no where near as frazzled and happy to share their expertise.

In the office, there was a cast of dozens with whom I had no acquaintance and no interaction and no real need of interaction.

What remote working informs us of is those networks of people with useful knowledge and skills that we tap over and over again. A good monitoring program (assuming such interactions were forced out of email) would quickly identify the dead zones in the network to expose further productivity gains."
2020-06-23 14:07,"I'm not sure this article gives a balanced look at this important issue. It still feels like employers are very insecure about their workforce, they need to ""monitor"" them to feel productive themselves. Its middle management angst.

I'm also not sure men quite understand how much time many women spend every morning getting ready for work. Once you add a commute, you're easily looking at an hour and half. The return trip and a change of clothes, is another hour. So 2.5 hours a day just because she going into the office?

That time, if given to work, is 31% more time on the job for an eight hour day.

So then there is the ""burnout issue""? Compared to commuting and hair drying/makeup every day? The idea that you have to use your personal time in such a mindless and frustrating way for 2.5 hours a day - and still have all the workload stress? That seems more likely to produce burnout.

There are lots of issues with work from home but this article doesn't begin to peel the onion."
2020-06-23 14:08,"Remote work certainly benefits employees by eliminating commutes that average close to one hour a day. It's a bit early, however, to conclude that remote work will benefit organizations for the long-term. Performance and productivity gains will only be sustained if remote workers' human need for social connection is met. For those who live alone or who rely on work to meet social needs, this requires taking time to get to know their work colleagues on a deeper level and developing in-person relationships in their community. 

The article at the link below summarizes the negative effects of loneliness on individuals and organizations. The growing social isolation from physical separation required to prevent virus transmission makes the risk to organizational productivity and performance even greater today.

2020-06-23 14:57,"There are always pros and cons about this specific subject from both points of view, employers and employees. The fact of the matter is what factors outweight among them. Avoiding to commute, saving money in gas and time increasing your well being, having meals at home, not being disturbed by any colleage telling you what was their weekend like and so on, in my humble opinion outweight the risk of isolation or lack of social relationship. Moreover, I think working from home is gonna become a tendency in a medium and long run. While companies profits keeps their trend to grow, this will go on and eventually, will be settle as our daily routine."
2020-06-23 14:58,"What this article also doesn't talk much about is the blurred line between work life and personal life now that they're essentially the same. For months, my work-from-home schedule has been work 8-9 hours during the day, take a walk and eat dinner, then get back on work e-mail until 10 or 11:00 at night. The e-mails don't stop. Office policy questions to co-workers and questions by clients that could have been answered with a (quick) in-person meeting now lead to a never-ending back-and-forth e-mail chain. My co-workers and I are drowning and our boss doesn't care--she just brags to her boss about how much more work we do. I am single and childless and had a reasonable commute and HATE working from home.  Too bad I work at a university and they have told us it could be 1-2 YEARS before we're allowed to work in our offices again."

""not having boundaries to the workday."" There's good and bad to this. If it means that someone can work those 8+ hours of the day when they're most productive - say 10 am to 6 or 7 pm instead of the obligatory 8 to 4 or 5 - then that's great. If it means that the 8+ hour day now extends to 10, 12, 14 or more hours of the day - because hey, you don't have to commute anymore so now you can do more work - then anticipate employees who wear out, or if the economy improves - bail out for another employer."

It's hard for him to stop working in the evening, so his day keeps extending. I worry about him.

2020-06-23 16:20,"More than isolation, the greatest problem is the lack of separation between work and personal life, even if you set work hours and space.

I was used to working from home and did find it more efficient due to the nature of my job, which requires little interaction with others.

However, once it became a full-time situation, I found that this only held true as long as I did feel productive.  At a particularly tough patch where I couldn’t make progress because I was waiting on others, the sense of being stuck work-wise was conflated with being stuck at home.

I took a mental health day break for myself to get away from emails, analyze the situation (ie separate work issues from pandemic) and remind myself it’s not so bad because I still have a job."

Or a widget of enterprise software development? Or a quatloo of engineering? It's not hard to exceed productivity standards when all you're producing are fundamentally superfluous, ephemeral 'virtual' goods like so many mass-less point particles. The trouble with this huge expansion in telecommuting is that employers are soon going to figure out they no longer need to maintain the fiction of a highly paid, professionally degreed workforce employed at sunny chic-modern office parks. Once that happens and the food bank becomes a way of life for many,  society will wake up to the fact that outfits like Splunk have no meaningful social value whatsoever."
2020-06-23 17:07,"“In Houston, Elysa Nelson, a vice president at Pierpont Communications, a public relations firm, said she had hoped that the transition to remote work might free her up from some of her management duties, allowing her to spend more time focused on clients and less time tending to her more junior colleagues.
But Ms. Nelson, who does not have children, said in addition to managing her own clients, she was helping her employees, in a “momlike fashion,” navigate working from home.”

What does Ms. Nelson imagine management is supposed to do? It seems pretty evident that the employees she manages are more of an annoyance to her than the reason the company produces anything at all. If that is her attitude, for god’s sake reassign those employees to someone else and let her focus on the clients. You know, the REALLY important people. Amazing how she manages to insult both motherhood AND good people management in the same breath."

2020-06-23 17:43,"If productivity has improved, it’s most likely for so-called “knowledge workers.” My intuition, however, is that such gains could be short-lived.  In my own experience, the quiet of home frees up some of my time to work on “deliverables.”  That’s good, but what I’ve mostly been delivering on, are things that were largely conceived pre-COVID.

While I am pleased that my company, and I, have been able to adapt our strategies to COVID, my experience is that meaningful, long-term innovation comes from human interaction — from people meeting formally and informally to share and refine ideas.  Although some of this can be done via phone, or video, or e-mail, nothing beats face-to-face contact.  

At their best, companies are not just means of production, and the people within them are not just economic units.  Companies — good ones, anyway — are social organisms and part of the fabric of society.  “Productivity”  is one measure of business success, but we should not mistake short-term gains as indicators of sustainable (or even desirable) changes.  Some of the most urgent problems we face right now are social, and they are unlikely to be solved by less human interaction."
2020-06-23 17:44,"The increased productivity isn't a surprise to me.   The hour spent commuting is back in my life.   I can throw something in the oven for dinner between meetings instead of arriving exhausted and hungry after a long day.   I don't have to spend time doing the laundry needed to look professional.   I can provide value to my employer more on my terms.   There is a big difference between working a hard 8 hours per day versus a hard 9-10 hours - those 1-2 extra hours are your life and some office employers increasing expect them, and then people get burned out and are less productive.   The WFH covid experiment has given time back.   Covid is a real stress no doubt, but the pressure of trying to squeeze everything into every day was somewhat relieved.    I'm certainly lucky to be employed in a mostly WFH job.   I'm finding I can focus better at it.   Employers take note."
2020-06-23 17:53,"One point I don't see mentioned very often is that these teams who are working from home and staying productive all know each other. On my team, we have personal relationships established, know who to ask for help when stuck, and have trust in each other to get stuff done. I definitely want to continue mostly working from home (saving on lunches out and commute costs!) while also getting together occasionally in real life."
2020-06-23 18:17,"One factor I do not hear discussed in articles about the move from home is the terror with which many of us are currently working.  With all the changes in the economy caused by lockdowns, previously secure jobs now feel shakey and it is clear that if laid off, finding another role will be challenging (if not impossible). 

I am a newly remote worker. My productivity is up, and I am hoping that will save my job. However, I hardly sleep, cry more frequently than ever before, and have started experiencing panic attacks regularly for the first time in my life. I am exhausted and burnt out. But boy oh boy am I productive."
2020-06-23 18:46,I had usually found that bosses and management get in the way of productivity.
2020-06-23 19:17,"If Elysa Nelson is tired of the employees she is supposed to manage ""barging into [her] office,"" there's a simple solution:

Go to your boss, tell him or her that you have learned that you really don't want to be responsible for managing people, and ask to be moved to a position in which all you have to be responsible for focusing on clients.

It's a HUGE issue for companies that moving people up the scale in terms of responsibilities (and titles and salaries) often means moving them into positions in which they are responsible for managing people.  Managing is a skill that too many companies undervalue -- it part, because I suspect too few people do it well.

Companies need to figure out how to incent people who do their technical jobs really well -- both with money and with titles -- without leaving those who are either bad managers or who have no interest in managing others in the position of doing just that.  

At the same time, there needs to be recognition that being a good manager takes time.  Too many people have the attitude that ""managing staff"" is about admininistrtive stuff like approving time sheets and filling out performance appraisals.  If you're doing it right, it's a LOT more than that."
2020-06-23 20:25,"Due to my health issues (3-time cancer survivor, chemo, radiation, etc.), my husband has been working from home for going on 4 months.  After the first couple of weeks trying to find just the right home environment for him to work, we cleared out a spare room, set up two tables and he is able to get more work done at home than if he were in the office.  No interruptions (I respect his work time and the closed door).  No time wasted in commuting (45 minutes each way).  Not very many interruptions and only for work-related issues, not someone stopping by his desk to chat.  Yes, he works longer hours because he's not wasting time on those other things and, bottom line, he likes his job a lot more as a result.  So much less stress for him, and I like it because I don't have to listen to him vent all his frustrations.
We are both over 60 years of age and he was planning on retiring early, but is now saying that he would be willing to work longer under these circumstances.  
Employers take heed."
2020-06-23 21:03,"Going to the office everyday was not a problem when women used to stay at home and take care of the house and kids, but that is obviously no longer applicable for a very significant portion of the population. As someone mentioned in the comments, when you work from home, you can take mini-breaks and prepare meals, exercise, or simply have more time to relax instead of wasting it getting dressed, commuting, etc."
2020-06-23 22:27,"I am certainly more efficient when working from home. And, my office is more productive. One key to that productivity is less meetings and in-person conferences so leadership has time to respond to email far quicker."
2020-06-24 0:37,"of course people are more productive now than they were before the pandemic.

companies are hemorrhaging their capital reserves and laying off workers to cut costs. No one can afford to be in the least efficient quintile.

This isn't a story about more efficient working arrangements. It's a story about incentives, and the power of fear. It's a management lesson Amazon, for one, learned long before the pandemic. But who wants to live in a world where it becomes the norm?"
2020-06-24 0:02,"Ah, worker well-being.  That convenient bludgeon for whatever someone doesn't like.  ""Won't someone think of the workers?!"" 

Yes, someone has, and did, and that's why we're all working from home. If management is freaking out, have you tried a support group?"
2020-06-24 2:39,"I've been working from home for the past 10 weeks or so. The director of the government agency I work for had expressed support for work from home arrangements just before the pandemic struck. About 80% of the agency is now working from home. Productivity is at an all time high, according to all the metrics. 

I personally feel about equally productive as when I was in the office. But even being an introvert, I'm finding working at home to be incredibly boring and lonely. Maybe I would find it less so if we weren't in the midst of a pandemic, which has made other outlets for in person interactions, like going to classes at the gym risky."
2020-06-24 3:07,"Working from home is real problem if you're single and live alone.  I have my dog.  That's it.  I guess you can't meet your future husband at the office.   

The social life at my office wasn't great, but it was something.  

There need to be new forms of socialization now that the social life of the office is gone."
2020-06-24 10:29,"I have found that the people in my organization who are most eager to get back to the office are the ones that make working in the office exhausting. They’re loud, unconscious of their impact on people around them, needy, and far less productive than those of us who actually like the work we do. I wonder how many of the folk clamoring for a return to the old days are equally disruptive to their coworkers and just aren’t cognizant of it? I dread the day they call us back..."
2020-06-24 11:24,"I love working remotely. It does require different meeting prep, time and people management approaches. For those who rank office environment interaction as very important I wonder if they tend to be more extrovert than those who don’t. Regarding the different approaches to:

Remote Meeting Prep: standard meeting management (agenda/objectives, time management, action items, recap, etc) is essential; prepare visuals ahead to support participants understanding of concepts; have a method to visually “whiteboard” (I use Visio since it supports the type of work I do, find something that works for your participants)

Time management: standard techniques apply; create a pattern to start, have breaks, and end your work day. Consider scheduling breaks/meal times (it is important to eat nutritious meals to support your brain). Set blocks of time to focus on tasks (I put these on my work calendar which my colleagues can see as unavailable). At the end of the work day I plan my next day: move blocks to future day that I did not complete. Plan blocks for most important tasks for next day(s). 

People management: if you require support from others, be clear about what you want and identify the right person who can provide. Set a meeting time with agenda/objectives. If you require regular touch points/check-ins, set up a repeating meeting with the right person (if that day you don’t have anything to discuss cancel that occurrence, end meeting early if objectives achieved, end on time)"
2020-06-24 11:42,"While its nice to avoid commuting, after WFH for 3 months I can't wait to get back into the office. Yes for the all reasons mentioned like better collaboration and idea-generation, more connection to my colleagues, fun & laughter (instead of being alone), etc. And btw I will certainly continue to occasionally WFH (and encourage my team to do so). What worries me about permanent WFH is lack of opportunity for growth (esp for women & minorities - you thought it was hard to get a junior woman to speak up in a mtg? Try encouraging her on a zoom call with 14 people...) I think out of sight, out of mind for many execs, they won't give projects or promotions to people who are quietly sitting at home doing work. And while WFH is fine now - ie, we're getting stuff done - that's because we literally transcribed our last day in the office to the home like a template. That is, the culture, knowledge, in jokes, etc are all still relevant. And the processes we had as well. But its static and based on that last day. I don't think it will grow and evolve. Also we've hired 20 new people, they have to try to learn all that over a video call. I don't think its possible. Sure there are many annoying things about an office but lets not throw the baby out with the bath water. When my team and I are back in the office, my focus will be to make it as good as possible - for there and at home."
2020-06-23 13:46,"This could be a canary in the coal mine. 

Here is a company that makes nothing, doesn't resell merchandise, has no factory or storefront---it just moves money. 

But Square is now in financial difficulty because of the slowdown caused by the pandemic. And it is passing that pain onto the merchants it serves just when those merchants need it the most.

Buckle up."
2020-06-23 13:50,"Why anyone would engage, let alone trust with their money and business, to the twitter-sphere is a complete mystery to me."
2020-06-23 13:54,"SQUARE charges more for cards entered manually. Despite repeated requests to alter this policy during the quarantine, when ALL payments were done manually, SQUARE didn't even bother to respond. They made a fortune on these extra fees alone during March through now."
2020-06-23 13:54,"Tip of the iceberg. Next month eBay is taking over it's own payments, and making it mandatory to use if a seller wishes to continue to list on eBay. They have become so powerful it borders on a monopoly.

2020-06-23 13:58,"Thank you NYT for reporting on this.  That a digital payment company could arbitrarily withhold resources belonging to others is a sobering reminder of the dark possibilities of misplaced trust.

I will now know better than to ever consider using Square."
2020-06-23 13:58,"Irony: 
Mr. Dorsey has been praised for fact checking Donald Trump's tweets on Twitter, but If this reporting is accurate, Square is doing what we would expect Mr. Trump to do if he were in Mr. Dorsey's position: place his (Square's) financial interests ahead of his (its) customers.

Paraphrasing Tolstoy: All greedy rich people are alike. Each giving rich person is giving in his own way."
2020-06-23 14:02,"If that money is being held in the Square treasury and not in an escrow fund, this is fraudulent, regardless of the terms of service. Consent to withhold is not consent to co-mingle funds."
2020-06-23 14:04,I was seriously thinking of using Square for my small business. Not now. I rather suspect other small business owners will see the article and say the same. Reputation is everything.

During the pandemic I decided to save on costs by asking clients to send me cheques or cash via Venmo/Zelle. It’s a bit more hassle but in light of the economy I believe it’s the smart move. Knowing what I know now from this article, I have even more reasons to avoid Square and look into other providers with lower fees. Honestly it’s not rocket science and other people can easily provide similar services."
2020-06-23 14:20,"My small company has been on hold since March and we are close to stage 4 where we will start up again. We use Square.

Thank you for publishing this article!"
2020-06-23 14:20,"Square proved impossible to work with for our small business. We switched to PayPal long ago and couldn’t be happier. They have amazing customer service and have taken extremely helpful steps to support small business customers during the pandemic. PayPal automatically suspended loan payments on Working Capital loans in May, eliminated instant bank transfer fees, made it easy to postpone larger loans payments, and have committed over $500M to support Black-owned businesses. They saved our business in this difficult time, meanwhile Square is doing the opposite."

If that's true, why did she furlough 53 of her emplyees. Certainly those furloughs can't all be attributed to Square. It seems like an over statement or exaggeration - perhaps even a subtle advertising plug for Redde Payments. Grain of salt here."

2020-06-23 14:29,"Sorry Jack this is called stealing. The attorney genral of California needs to put a warrant out for Jacks arrest. In addition the US Treasury and its enforcement arm needs to get involved and crack down on this theft. There is no way around it this is a theft. And where is the funds in deposit that one would imagine a processor., just as a bank, should
have in order to legally handle and properly backstop
its operation. Is there an FDIC to protect americans against this type of scam? What is the law? And where are the law makers? Can any Jack just set up as a processor, take peoples money and keep it
as the processor see fit? 

Credit cars processing should be done by a government agency and not a private for profit company. I see their collection of money via a 
manufactured credit card and the collection of a fee as a form of counterfeiting. Now this eposode on top of the collection of fees itself proves what a scam and a shell game credit card processing is. We protest inequities in our society as we should be seems to ignore and let the Jacks run a foul. No justice."
2020-06-23 14:31,"I am sure this won't get approved to post but I'll say it anyway. Jack Dorsey is nothing but a billionaire trying to pass himself off as just ""one of the guys"". He acts like Trump, a spoiled rich kid who is going to take his ball, or block you on his forum in this case, and go home if you criticize him. He has not done nearly enough in the way of censoring dangerous imbeciles on Twitter and is bordering on conducting criminal activity by ""holding"" payment from merchants. A class action lawsuit needs to be filed ASAP!"
2020-06-23 15:01,"I quit facebook 4 years ago, when the data mining was just a rumor. Now, on twitter, on the phone, I block every ad that comes across my scroll. I don't care what company it's for. Until these 'platforms' become more socially responsible, it's the only way to get them to listen. Hit them in the pocketbook."
2020-06-23 15:03,We have a construction company in Seattle. Our problems with Square started 2 months ago when the amount of the service charge on their invoice did not match actual service charges deducted when the deposit was sent to our company checking account. Then two weeks ago they suspended our ability to accept deposits with no explanation.  Thankfully QuickBooks has a payment service with smaller fees. QuickBooks is also easy to get a hold of if you have a question. I am very disappointed with Square.
2020-06-23 15:01,Maybe Twitter is carrying a lot more debt than Dorsey is letting on. Has he given any of that billion dollars away yet? Twitter may end up as a Bernie Madoff copycat.
2020-06-23 15:21,"Square was not completely useless. In a world where almost any business has no choice but to accept credit cards, Square came up with a nifty solution for the smallest merchants. Everything they did was part of the contract that their customers agreed to. Now that there are competing solutions, stop doing business with Square! I certainly will make every effort to avoid paying through them. No one is holding a gun to their heads (unlike, say, Visa or Mastercard).

On the other hand, the fact that Twitter, ostensibly separate, is censoring posts about Square's behavior is completely outrageous. Who knows if it's legal but hopefully Mr. Dorsey will spend a lot of money on legal fees finding out.

The real story isn't about Square. The real story here is the fact that each American routinely clicks him or herself into thousands of pages of legal agreements every week, with no realistic way to evaluate or even read it all. In most cases there is no realistic alternative to ""signing,"" unless you don't want to have a mobile phone, email, credit cards, a bank account, an education, or a job.

It may be far down the list, below fixing our disgraceful criminal justice system and the yawning gaps in income and racial equality, but this issue needs to be addressed. ""Click-through"" license agreements are a joke--and always one-sided. There should be collectively negotiated, mandatory, standardized language for any legal agreement that serves as a de facto gateway to living a modern life."
2020-06-23 15:26,"Carefully buried in the middle of the article:
""It said it had put reserves in place on only 0.3 percent of its millions of merchants...we apply reserves on more ‘risky’ sellers, such as those that take prepayment for goods or services delivered at a future date, sell goods or services more prone to disputes, or operate in an industry that historically receives higher chargeback rates than others.""  
This sounds more than reasonable."

But if they are now replacing those reserves with cash withheld from customers, then the cash withheld during Q1 is going to free up. Add the fact that Square's stock is at an all-time high - which they could sell if they really needed extra cash - and it's hard to justify Square's actions against small businesses who right now need all the help they can get."

It's basically a float. And when Amazon faced a class action from its loyal sellers, it hid behind a confusing (and inconsistent) arbitration clause in its terms of use to avoid legal scrutiny, as will Square."

Square, under Dorsey, paid out $50 million to the actual inventor of square, a Florida U engineering professor named James McKelvey.  Ironically, they stole the company so quickly from him they didn't even bother making him assign his patent rights, so the original patents went to him.  That's why a year after starting they suddenly recalled all their original square readers and replaced them with new ones specifically engineered around the original patents.  Their sleazy attempt to cheat their cofounder failed I guess.  What did Woz say (about Jobs psychopathy)? ""Business ethics are different than personal ethics"".  
However, illegal contracts can't aren't usually enforceable. A judge might punish Square if a lawyer is brave enough to go after them with a class action lawsuit. Customers should crowdfund one. Their self serving sudden unethical change in behavior broke a likely enforceable implied contract."

I’ve donated throughout the past years in support of local animal rights groups/organizations. I’m glad that they are making progress during our pandemic times.

The reading of this article still paints a rather grim picture in a continent-sized country where animals of all kinds (both tames and wild) are being treated in the most appalling conditions, to put it mildly. 
It's perhaps worth repeating here that China to this day remains the main driving force behind the slaughtering to near-extinction of countless wild species across the globe, all for the benefit of a very questionable practice of medicine. 
All in all, it's rather hard to feel overjoyed for such a little drop into the ocean when this represents so little compared to what remains undone as to the treatment of Nature in all its magnificent diversity. 
For that reason, such a measure seems too little too late and merely hairbrushes the surface of a much larger issue at stake. Perhaps, this highlights one small step in the right direction although there is still so much ground to cover. 
With that said, maybe being a dog in 2020 China will be better than being a dog in China of yesteryear."

Based off of that, it may be worth your time to investigate Mr. Zhao and other purveyors of canine meat for foreign influence? And if they're innocent, well, it isn't like some time in a facility or an interrogation will hurt them. Consider it. They may even thank you for it, later."

2020-06-23 19:28,"I fail to understand the reasoning behind fighting for a ban on dog and cat meat, while ignoring the suffering of domestic livestock destined to be consumed. 

Most commenters here who declare they're ""sickened"" by these  pictures are doing exactly that.  

Has any of you looked at your own plate lately? Do you ever ask yourself how that animal lived and died?

A pig, for example, is a sensitive and intelligent animal - it's been established through scientific investigation that pigs are more intelligent than dogs.

Western meat-eaters have no right to demand that any other culture stop eating dogs and cats.   The Chinese clearly regard dogs and cats as food animals, the way we classify pigs, cattle, etc.  We regard them as pets.  The classification is arbitrary. 

We could certainly demand that dogs and cats destined for the Chinese plate be treated more humanely.  But before doing so, we'd better think hard about the animals on our own plates.  Truly humane treatment of food animals often is incompatible with consumer demand for the cheapest meat possible.   

Until Westerners in general decide they're willing to eat a lot less meat and pay more for it, factory farming with its millions of closely confined animals and long-distance shipping will continue. 

Ask yourself if you really care about animal suffering, like you claim to. Or is it just selective sentimentality?

P.S. I haven't eaten meat since 1981, if it matters"

We stumbled upon a couple of poachers going after elephants and rhinos. I couldn’t understand why on earth anyone would want to kill those animals. Our driver, a local man, told me that they sell the ivory to the Chinese. Almost all the buyers of wildlife killed in East Africa were Chinese, he said. I have never forgotten that as I’ve watched wildlife species around the world fall dangerously close to extinction. As horrible as this is to me, I cannot begin to understand how people can eat dogs and cats — who have become members of families in almost every culture around the globe. I wish these brave activists great success. And if there is a way to help support them, I will."

I have seen far worse photos and video of the transportation of the Yulin festival dogs, the boiling of the dogs (sometimes still alive), and the happy consumption of these animals by attendees. I am ecstatic to read that views are changing about eating animals within cultures and around the world. We can live more compassionately and sustainably through plant-based diets. I say this as someone who is not rich, but healthy and happy with lots of furry companions."

I most heartily agree the crude slaughter of domestic farm animals is not only stomach turning but dangerous in it breeds E. coli and other diseases passed to them and us.But there is a way to humanely end the life span of cows, pigs, chickens, and other domesticates. Agriculture industry is not that way. But small scale farms and farmers who raise heritage animals butcher them in a way that the animals are not fearful or stressed, they respect the life and resources each animal gives. Add to that the numbers of animals used for food would dwindle dramatically and the price for those products the animals generate would make meat and dairy products rare and an occasional part of meals. And we , the world and our domesticated farm creatures would be the better for that."
2020-06-23 21:28,"Besides being pets, I think the thing that repulses me about eating dog and cat meat is that they are carnivores. I’m not a vegetarian but I like to think that the local farm raised meat I consume comes from animals that are."

I'm not anti-meat, or ""vegan"", but the humane treatment of animals, even animals we eventually consume is a reflection on our species.  China wants the world to look at it as a first-world nation, this kind of behavior has the opposite effect.  Unfortunately, the CCP views humans as expendable so don't hold your breath for the slaughter and consumption of any animal stop in China.  The decimation of African species like rhinoceros and big cats is directly a result of Chinese exploitation."

Racism is the kissing cousin of animal discrimination.  I have been a lifelong vegan for 77 years and am in perfect health without the toxic trash that animal products offer.

I lived in Guangzhou, a polluted city with delicious cuisine, in the 90’s, and there was an unfortunate but true saying which the rest of the country had for the province: people in Guangdong eat anything with 4 legs, except for a table. Dog meat was a delicacy which made my stomach churn despite wanting to remain culturally open-minded. Truck loads would drive by in smoggy traffic (as would trucks crammed inhumanely with pigs). It felt as though people had suffered so much themselves in the country that no one batted an eye when animals were treated so ghastly.

Having unsuspected consumed a very delicious meat at a friend’s table I almost gagged when told ‘gourou’ – dog meat; but had to admit why sometime consumed, though very expensive --  meat eaters do taste better for those ‘unconcerned.’ 
You do not want to know the story of any piece of meat really."
2020-06-23 23:51,"It's far preferable that the Chinese eat dogs and cats rather than their wildlife, and while I cannot take issue with Chinese activists protesting, eating dogs is no worse than the eating of other animals by those from many other cultures. Protecting wildlife should be a universal human value, and it is not racist for pressure to be put on China to close down wildlife wet markets."
2020-06-24 0:25,"I really wanted to scream when I read this quote a Mr. Zhao said, “To elevate the status of animals is to degrade the status of people, thus violating the principles of humanism.” since when has the Chinese Government cared about people?

They kill students, anyone who dissents, they don't protect their children from pedophiles as Wang Zhenhua, a billionaire real-estate developer and former Communist Party member, was jailed for only five years for child molestation.

So why they should care about cats and dogs or other animals? As a lover of dogs I find this highly offensive. But as I see farmers here in the USA breeding and killing chickens, cows, and pigs with such violence I shutter. Yes there are many mouths to feed in China and certainly the government there has enough foresight and education to bring about meaningful change and to see that all animals are treated with dignity as well as their people. We should do the same here in the USA."

The fact that the Yulin Dog Meat festival is still happening and that China has no laws banning animal cruelty is evidence of how difficult it is to change “cultural traditions” in that country, and how change is so badly needed.

I am obviously unaware that the medical literature is littered with inaccuracies and falsehoods.  They instead get their information from the far superior, crowd sourced Facebook.  

I consider myself to be a reasonably well socialized and companionable individual, yet in these interactions I have been accused of being hostile, offensive, insulting, arrogant and belligerent.  No death threats yet, but that's probably because I am not a clinician.

2. Aversion to loss - a very powerful bias. Wanting to hold on to old ways of being and doing
3. Seeking normalcy - I want to go back, to preserve what worked for me before.

They apparently believe this so strongly that they are appearing, heavily armed,  at the homes of public health officials, as well as issuing death threats through mail, social media, etc.  I am surprised that these people have overlooked another infringement of their freedom recommended by Doctors: wearing bandages on wounds in the skin, from injuries to surgical suture sites.  ""Hey, you can't tell us to wear bandages; we have freedom!""  The mask serves the same purpose as a bandage, protecting a person from infection.  It also serves another purpose, protecting others from becoming infected by you if you happen to become infected but don't know it.  So, apparently we have fought many wars to ensure that Americans are free to fail to protect themselves from infection, and also free to refuse to protect others from becoming infected by them."

Instead of thanking people for their service, it is high time the American public started serving this country by doing the frankly minimal thing of wearing a face shield or a mask. If that is too much for some, then we truly have lost our way. 

Anne Frank stayed hidden for 761 days with no guarantee she would live ultimately, and she did not.  Americans can't even stay quieter for 76 days and wear a simple mask to control a viral outbreak.

The checkout clerk was visibly upset. Our store had done such a great job of systems to reduce this the risk of the virus. We had the sense that the person actually wanted people to die. Outside of bacteria and virus, the deadliest predator of humans are other humans. Perhaps, Mr. Trumps last irrational will be, “I maimed or killed more people than any other person in history! I’m more famous than the Grim Reaper!”"
2020-06-23 14:33,"It starts at the top.  The example set by our president leads to distrust, doubt, and outright disdain for anyone and anything that threatens his position.  He's tired of the virus so he wants to move on and doesn't want to hear anymore about it.  He's ""fake news"" this to his followers so they see any mention of the virus as a direct hit on him, and by extension, on them."
2020-06-23 14:37,"The levels of incompetence in health officials was stunning. Scarier than the virus, even."
2020-06-23 14:40,"Yet another difference comparing the United States and Canada. From coast to coast (BC to NL) our public health officials have been met with respect, praise, even celebrity status (with reserve, of course). Death threats, anti-Semitism, vitriol—unheard of here.

May the border remain closed until the US gets things under control."
2020-06-23 14:21,"I just never knew that there were so many hateful, ignorant people in our Country."
2020-06-23 15:03,"The virus has revealed the level of ignorance and hatefulness in our country.   Threatening healthcare workers or  fighting for personal freedom to not wear a mask during a pandemic is so ignorant it reminds me of the Africans fighting the healthcare workers trying to help them during an Ebola outbreak.  Has our country devolved into such uneducated ignorance?   The truth is, it has and our president is leading the way."
2020-06-23 14:50,"Wearing a mask conveys that the pandemic is real. Followers of the right are told a story of pandemic denial and told to frame the story as a personal freedom infringement, which is nonsense. These people are afraid of change. They don’t object to the requirement to wear shoes and a shirt in restaurants. That’s a health issue to protect others from your germs. So why object to wearing a mask in a grocery store?"
2020-06-23 14:46,"You’all be sorry when there are no public health workers left for the next P.A. democracy or public health crisis. And it’s definitely coming. No epidemiologists left to identify where/how it started or who’s at risk, no public health nurses to advise you and care for you at home or in clinics, no public health educators to communicate prevention or risk reduction strategies. 

Then we’ll see how important your “freedom” is (to be selfish? To be stupid?). To shirts, no shoes, no masks, no service. 

Please let us work together to return to common sense and trust in science, expertise and community experience. Starting with the ballot (almost said voting booth, but we won’t be going into those anytime soon)."
2020-06-23 14:53,"Thanks to Trump, we are not only a nation that eschews science, we are now a nation that threatens to kill scientists. These people need to be found, arrested, convicted and thrown in jail before they act on their threats."
2020-06-23 14:57,"Thank you Julie Bosman and the NYT. 
It is on my list to read the Rise and the Fall of the Third Reich, but we may be living through something similar. The famous Dr. Amy Action, the Director of Public Health in Ohio, whose work has made Republican Governor Mike DeWine look like a hero, has just stepped down according to this new report due to death threats, including armed vigilantes on her front lawn.
While I feel a great temptation to pray to the god or goddess, perhaps we need to focus on making the second blue wave a tsunami of success. Support science, voting rights, and vote."
2020-06-23 15:01,"So why is Trump’s “law and order” agenda focussed on protesters and protecting statues of people who supported and went to war for slavery ... and not at all focussed on hate crimes of threatening public health officials and armed occupation of state capitals.  Protesters are trying to fix decades of injustice whereas militant libertarians are trying to fix (?) merely days of discomfort, inconvenience and lost income. Those protesting systemic racism are working to create a better society whereas those protesting lockdowns and public health guidelines are selfishly focussed only on themselves and the rest of American society can die of the virus for all they care. Hey, GOP leaders, who’s the real criminal here?  Who needs to be caught and prosecuted and get up to 10 years in jail ... statue defacers or healthworker threateners?"
2020-06-23 15:02,"My father told me early in my career that if you join the medical profession, keep in mind the ""witch doctor"" attitude of those who are ignorant and suspicious of your trade.

Once you as the ""witch doctor"" cast an evil spell or portend a disease ,you are banished from the tribe as an outcast.

The minute one member of the tribe gets sick they will all come running....

Yes, human behavior remains as it was 50,000 years ago...."

2020-06-23 14:55,"Who are these people? Who makes death threats to someone that they disagree with? 

Threats are one thing, but these people appear to be heavily armed as we saw in the attack (I won't call it a protest) on the Michigan state house. 

All I can say is that I'm glad I'm old and feel sorry for the kids that are eventually going to have to clean this mess up...if there is a mess left to clean up."
2020-06-23 14:58,This is the forth story I heard like this in 2 days.  It's a shame that they can't be identified and then denied service if they get sick.
2020-06-23 15:03,"It’s unbelievable. But at the rate this is going with some people not taking this seriously, not wearing face masks, going to crowded places, I’m guessing we’re going to have a smaller population once it’s all over. On one hand you want to say “good riddance” to all the imbeciles, but given the nature of the contagion, they could infect who know how many other innocent people who are taking precautions or are on the front line serving them or, if they ever get hospitalized, caring for them. 

This can all be blamed on the chaotic Trump administration with its often incoherent mixed messaging, contradictions, Trump himself refusing to follow guidelines and wear a mask and urging states to reopen on the heels of his experts saying just the opposite; his frequent hateful rhetoric and mocking of officials who tried to follow his experts’ guidelines while he himself contradicted them and urged states to reopen, plus the withholding or rationing of PPE by the federal government making states compete internationally for medical supplies, insufficient testing and contact tracing - the list goes on and on. As Trump would say,  It’s a disgrace. But he should look in the mirror whenever he says it."
2020-06-23 15:05,"This country has gone bonkers. Trump is both a signpost and symptom of this insanity, of the narcissistic, often racist impulses that run through our country in the name of personal freedom. “I take no responsibility.” Exactly. There is a lack of leadership from the President and the GOP, lack of responsibility and care in the masses. Yesterday I was practically assisted in a market by two guys not wearing masks in a store where the sign on the door said “mask required by law.” I hadn’t said or done anything— they simply saw in my eyes the question. And I am immunocompromized."
2020-06-23 15:06,"“There is a cult of ignorance in the United States, and there has always been. The strain of anti-intellectualism has been a constant thread winding its way through our political and cultural life, nurtured by the false notion that democracy means that my ignorance is just as good as your knowledge.” 
— Isaac Asimov

When you mix ignorance and hatred, fueled by social media, the alt right, Fox News, etc etc, and then you arm that ignorance, you produce a type of social cancer that is a growing existential threat.  What well trained, conscientious public health official would take a job under these conditions?  I’m very concerned about what happens if Trump loses reelection, and the Dems take the Senate and keep the House."
2020-06-23 14:50,"""“We’ve never seen this level of vitriol before,” said Kat DeBurgh, the executive director of the Health Officers Association of California. ""
The people in this country have been led down a path lined with hate, doublespeak and self serving dogma. This is the culmination of our current administrations never ending lies and divisive rhetoric meant to manipulate and divide the people. This is the real danger we face now as a Democracy.
 People have been misled and ignored by both sides of our political leadership resulting in an opening for the likes of a master manipulator like DT to step in and take the reigns from one party and put their undemocratic agenda on steroids. Dog whistles have been replaced by blatant and clear normalization of racism, distrust of science and historically acceptable authoritative institutions and the people in them. We are witness to the dismemberment of our government, our society and our security in a very dangerous world. 
November must be followed by a concerted effort to rebuild and establish trust with truth as the standard from our leaders and our institutions. Those who would continue to foment division and hate should be held in check. Social Media must be held accountable for their part in this. It is the only way our country will heal and return even stronger than before this fall from grace. We must return the US to our place as the bastion of freedom and denounce those who would seek to us down the path of authoritarianism."
2020-06-23 14:55,"As enthusiastic as people are for the idea here, the pandemic will NOT be the gateway to the statist utopia they desperately want. There is no appetite for further shutdowns among regular people, and especially among those to lose the most with continued stalling. The people doing these things, however misguided they are, still represent a sizeable portion of the proles that readers here seem to valorize or vilify depending on the time of day, and they have spoken. The applause for the east Asian nations and NZ for their own strict response is always premature because a small number of cases will (and has) always re-ignite that response. You cannot stop a pandemic in it's tracks, learn to live with it."
2020-06-23 14:59,"I wonder how those trespassing on private property to ""protest"" and threaten civil servants would react to the same being done on their property? No doubt firearms would be involved."
2020-06-23 15:02,"Maybe the police could focus on tracking down people who make these threats and make sure that everyone is safe.  It is terrifying that this is allowed to go on.  America has become what used to be called a third world country.   With disenfranchised voters how do we change this?  Jefferson County has 600,000 voters and one polling office.  How did that happen?  What is the education system failing to do when people have such a poor grasp of science they do not understand what is happening with this Covid 19.  Our democracy has been demolished and allows these people to deride and threaten the only people who are actually trying to save save us in this crisis.  We need to look at ourselves in mirror and ask what can we do to stop the rot, and actually work to get democracy back on it’s feet.  The elite of the US who just want to make as much money as possible.  They love the Republicans so they can keep most of their money and shed the responsibilities of great wealth.   They don’t care that the Republicans will do anything to stay in power there is no bar too low for them.   Now we are all paying the price."
2020-06-23 15:06,"Not that I’m making excuses for these people, but I would imagine that some small business owners (especially recent ones) are getting pretty frantic these days. Extreme anxiety make people do drastic things and many of these folks are in it with all they have and failure would be a catastrophe for them and their families. 

While I understand and sympathize with those under such pressure, death threats are just unacceptable."
2020-06-23 15:06,"Conservatives learn by one way....and one way only. That’s through personal experience. 

Conservatives are not going to slow down or shut down, nor are they willing to properly execute a financial plan that could help bridge this crisis appropriately. 

The Southern and Western states are simply going to burn up. Lots of infections and lots of pain. They also are willing to tolerate that pain and have said so publicly. Let them go!

If I was the Northeast, Mid Atlantic and Upper Midwest, I would focus on what harm reduction policies can be put into place as interstate travel resumes."
2020-06-23 15:10,"We have special criminal categories when people attack police and some other people.  We should have them for medical.  In war, medical is the best recognized category of worker that is off limits to violence.  In civilian life, it should be the same.  The same offense that carries a misdemeanor penalty when threatening an ordinary person should carry a felony penalty when the person is part of public health or health and hospitals.

As for the armed thugs who have been threatening everybody and then falling back on ""right to carry"" ""2nd Amendment protest"" as their excuse, they should be booked, charged with felony menacing, convicted, have their weapons confiscated, and just thrown in jail until such time as we don't have enough people who know how to act in public to populate our streets.

Our County Public Health Director has received threats.  If they find those people, I hope they spend the rest of their lives paying it off.  They should be charged with one count of felony assault for each healthy resident in the county whose health they have threatened.  And held without bond until trial. A threat to health during a pandemic is a crime against thousands if not millions."
2020-06-23 15:02,"This is the direct result of the mixed messages coming from Washington. People are angry about the fact that the world has been turned upside down, and the lack of clear, calm, consistent voices explaining the whys and wherefores of the problem has inevitably devolved into a chaos of inchoate, free-floating angst that want to shoot the messenger because they don't like the message."
2020-06-23 15:04,"Indeed frightening that the very people who put their own lives on the line to save others, have to face not only deadly disease but death threats from the very people they are trying to protect. It isn't hard to understand why some choose to walk away, having had enough of this monstrous bargain. Healthcare workers in my own family have endured caring for extremely sick people, and even contracted Covid-19 in the line of duty. They and all the front line people deserve better than this."
2020-06-23 15:00,"We live in a time of people feeling bold enough to harm those they do not agree with. This feeling of emboldened crosses all institutions such as education and healthcare. If a person doesn't want to do something or disagrees with others, they feel that threatening the person who advocates what they don't want is necessary. How did we get to this point? Some point to leaders who threaten those they disagree with in the form of negative language, firing, and even physical harm. As a physician/surgeon/professor, I am not going to always tell a patient/student what they want to hear but what they need to hear. Threatening me with physical harm isn't going to change what I say. I am not going to change what my education and training have taught me whether you like it or not. In the end, you either follow my directions (which you have paid for) or you don't. That's your choice but I don't care if you like what I say or you don't.  The world does not always give what we ""like"" but what it will give. In Ohio, the loss of Dr. Amy Acton is huge."
2020-06-23 15:25,"I would like to thank the health care professionals, particularly Dr. Barbara Ferrer, for their hard work on behalf of us all.  They embody the best of us; they work tirelessly to help thousands of people whom they do knot even know.  

Dr. Ferrer led the Public Health office in Boston, successfully, for many years; she is dedicated to the well being of all.  

Thank you, Dr. Ferrer and all other health professionals."
2020-06-23 15:20,"Our public health officials - those responsible for helping to save our lives, to guide us through this pandemic - are receiving death threats. They are being harassed, not only online or over the phone but in person. They are being hounded and intimidated and threatened by people (often armed) camped outside their homes.

I first read about this yesterday in the Washington Post and I didn't think that anything going on in this country right now could shock me but this did. This is insanity.

And rather than call them off and strongly support the health officials who are working for the well-being of all citizens as a normal leader would, Donald Trump has given these misguided fools and vicious bullies his tacit approval to engage in this anti-social behavior on his behalf. 

The U.S. has reached a level of depravity under Donald Trump and the GOP that will be difficult to recover from. Without competent public health officials, we have no hope of achieving the successful contaminant of the virus that other western industrialized nations have achieved. We have already lost tens of thousands of lives that might have been saved had the US government and its citizens responded adequately and we are on track to lose tens of thousands more for the same reason. But beyond that, we have a sick civil society in which a sizable proportion have lost their rationality, critical thinking skills and sense of decency and humanity. If a public health officials aren't safe here, who is?"

2020-06-23 15:30,I hate to say this but my hope is that the people who live in Yakama county and willfully ignore the health department guidance should have to pay the consequences. Healthcare workers should not go out of the way to help these irresponsible selfish residents. They have learn through pain of loss.
2020-06-23 15:27,"I read somewhere the expected life of a Democracy is about 200 years before it topples. We gave it a good run, but Trump put his foot on the gas peddle and advanced us even closer to the end. I also blame the far right and far left, and Silicon Valley- they are the true creators of WMD.

2020-06-23 15:33,"No only is our country lagging many others in the way we are managing the Coronavirus, but our people are proud of it.  They cheer on the incoherent President who says testing is the cause of growing Covid cases.  They threaten the very people who pull people from the jaws of death and despair from this terrible disease.  

Americans are banned from entering most countries in the world because we are sick nation which is unwilling to take precautions that would improve the health of thousands of people.  America is no longer the beacon of light on the hill.  No longer the land of opportunity where education, health care and jobs give us a strong middle class. That’s New Zealand, Scandinavia, Canada .... When will the President make this country great again?  It certainly hasn’t happened yet and certainly hasn’t happened for people of color.  

Vote.  Please vote in November.  Vote for a better future."

More than anything, this type of  behaviour indicates a fundamental failure of an underfunded education system.  It is ignorance, not evil, that divides and destroys the cohesiveness of the country.  It is a distrust of medical professionals that leads some to attack the messenger rather than addressing the critical message they are revealing.  Those who are attacking medical professionals are doing so on the basis of opinion and 
beliefs rather than established facts.  But their beliefs will manifest themselves in an even greater and more widespread tragedy that effects everybody in the nation."

But, we never talk about the current state of anything, especially COVID 19. Why?  Because, when our Republican neighbors—delightful in every way—say they don’t know who to believe anymore, I realize how deep the national infection has spread. 

Facebook and Fox—those two F’s—but it’s our country which gets a failing grade."
2020-06-23 15:37,"As appalling as these individual stories of harassment and threatening behavior might be, this story is incomplete without mentioning Dr. Amy Acton, who last week resigned from her position as Director of the Ohio Department of Health.

Dr. Acton had provided peerless public health leadership and guidance to the State of Ohio, precisely when it was most needed. But, because she advocated for the early lockdown of the state she became a target of the anti-lockdown minority in Ohio. All while Governor DeWine repeatedly pleaded that they point their ire at him, as the person making the lockdown decisions, not Dr. Acton who provided him with the advice leading to the policy.

Not content to merely stage demonstrations at the Statehouse, these anti-lockdowners repeatedly sued Acton, used vile anti-semitic slurs. But worse was to come. They took up post outside her family home, on her lawn, armed, terrorizing her children. That was likely the last straw forcing her to put her family's safety above all others.

I will not easily forgive the protestors for bringing their vile tactics to her domicile."
2020-06-23 15:45,"How come trump doesn't direct his need for law & order to those harassing & threatening the lives of medical professionals trying to help their fellow citizens?

""Her"" people happen to be American people as she is an American.
As a Canadian, I've heard my PM and his Cabinet members tell Canadians that there is no place for anti-Asian discrimination or blame  in the country several times, so we're not angels, either.
I just didn't know it was so bad that someone would threaten or spit on a doctor.  It's utterly disgusting behaviour. Shame on all of us who think and act this way."

Maybe h1bs or is that a type of flu from Asia.

2020-06-23 15:56,"When I heard that Dr. Fauci had to get security because of death threats from Trumpists who were upset that Dr. Fauci was making their Fuhrer look bad, I thought that was the worst.  Reading this article makes me realize their no depth to which these people WON'T sink.

What's going to happen to the United States?  Even with the best case scenario, where Trump and his minions are all packed off to jail, people like the ones who will stand outside a public health official's house with guns, are still going to be part of the populace.  How can a nation heal with people like that running wild?  

I fear for the future of the US.  There's been talk that the Canada/US border is going to be reopened.  I wish we could shut it up tighter, to keep whatever poison that is infecting our southern neighbour out."
2020-06-23 15:53,I have several friends who are public health officials.  They have worked on infectious disease/public health issues for decades.  I trust their judgment more than someone without any training or experience.  They have all received death threats on their public emails.  This is outrageous.  I put a lot of the blame on Trump and the administration which downplays scientific research and knowledge.
2020-06-23 15:54,"Interestingly, although the article mentions death threats in the title, it does not mention a specific incident that a death threat has been reported to the police, investigated and prosecuted.  Death threats are not protected speech.  Calling someone a nazi, although outrageous is not a death threat.  Protesting outside someone's house is a constitutional right subject to reasonable time place and manner restrictions.  I have read one case in California is being investigated by police because of threats.  So, their is a real question about whether there are ""many"" death threats or there is angry talk which is quite different than threats.  These very health administrators, though their ordres, have tried to restrict our constitutional rights including our rights to protest so it is fitting, and constitutionally protected, that there are in fact protests at their homes."
2020-06-23 15:36,"When I write something in an open forum, I attach my name to it. Here I am! So, why do we not require ‘social media’ to disclose the real name and, at least, city from where these threatening cowards bed down. There is no problem for them to get those names. Just require a credit
card as verification. My hometown newspaper would not run an opinion piece without the writer disclosing their name. It keeps things on a level playing field and allows one to seek criminal charges when someone threatens your life. This, folks, is the biggest problem with the internet - anonymity - and it can and should be fixed. It will have to be forced on the leviathons seeking to control our world - the tech companies."
2020-06-23 15:36,"People in civilized countries would never behave this way. We have a failed education system, and a white underclass that seems to think their violence is always permissible. White skin and an entitled attitude are not equivalent to an education and training for a meaningful career. Unfortunately, these people have spent their limited means not on passports and travel, but on guns and more guns. They expand their guts and their arsenals instead of their minds. Add a platform where death threats are permissible and the weakest-minded feel they can challenge the responsible members of our society, who dedicated themselves to medicine and public service. The medical professionals receiving death threats have worked harder to get where they are than the people threatening them can imagine. So they are attacked, rather than challenged intellectually, because their attackers lack developed intellects. Strong and stable countries are not populated by the dregs, are they."

Dr. Clayton Chau in Irvine is now the interim public health officer and said that face coverings are only strongly suggested and not mandatory. However, California Governer Gavin Newsom has now over-rided this with re-issuing a mandate to wear face coverings for the entire state. It's unclear how this will be enforced. Many are still in deep denial that we are in the midst of global pandemic and openly defying the face mask mandate. I see people in my neighborhood walking around without face masks and need to dodge them as I try to get excercise."
2020-06-23 15:52,"This is all part of the repudiation of condoms and vaccinations. It is scary to think that a sizable fraction of the population thinks the coronavirus is either fake or no worse than the flu, that global warming is a hoax, and that scientists and public health officials are threats to them. How did we fail to educate these people, or how do we reign in the nonsense that seems to inform their views?"
2020-06-23 15:52,"I remember a time when those of us in the medical profession were respected, our advice and recommendations heeded.  These rejections of sound medical science which are leading to harassment and worse are heart-breaking.  What happened to us?  Yes, it is not the majority of Americans who bully and defy and threaten.  But the minority who are vociferous and venomous are more than enough to not only psychologically harm and impugn but also continue and exacerbate Covid-19's spread and metastasis.  I know this has been send many times, and some will say it is hyperbolic:  it is about leadership, from Washington, DC to our state and local governments.  To that end we need to look straight at Donald Trump and his sycophants in his Cabinet and Congress.  You couple that with profound ignorance within the population, and we complete this recipe of national disaster."

How, then, to describe someone who would act out their feelings about something they don't understand by anonymously threatening the life of the person who's trying to help them understand? What word would actually sink in and move them to reflect, ""I've done wrong here"" and ""this is a personal growth opportunity, not a danger, for me""? Until that gets figured out, the acting out will continue, whether with anonymous death threats to healthcare experts or with anonymous tear-it-all-down votes in presidential elections."

Given 4 more years, what remains of any decency, any expectation that there is a common good to preserve?  With public health professionals and scientists hounded out of public service now, there is no going back to regain their talents. In the unlikely event that a vaccine is developed anytime soon, the administration will flop at all the thousands of details involved in the manufacture and distribution. No one competent will be left to get it done."

Social media and Trump are two contemporary phenomena that can (social media) and do (Trump) thwart civil society and overrun all the best impulses of humanity.  Social media and Trump have unleashed too many people to become their worst selves.

When we can rid ourselves of Trump -- by the civil means of the voting box, and not the by the tools of the mob which are the only tools he understands -- one of our toughest jobs will be to recreate our civil society.  

The same fundamental drives that can so easily make us our worst selves are also the drives we as a nation have always harnessed to do good.  That is the urgent task of all the good and rational among us now:  to return those fundamental drives into constructive, community-regarding channels."

Scientists say climate change is real - then there must be some ulterior motive to harm “real” America with a Chinese hoax.  
Doctors say vaccines are generally safe - then they must be lying to promote some secret agenda that harms our children with autism.  
Researchers say there isn’t evidence of widespread voter fraud - then they must be in the pocket of global elites trying to overwhelm decent god-fearing Americans with illegals.
Health officials say the novel coronavirus is dangerous - then they must be lying to take away our freedom, harm Donald Trump, enrich Bill Gates, usher in a new world government, help George Soros, or some other utterly stupid and nonsensical theory.  

These protesters never stop to think that if Bill Gates, George Soros, or the Democrats can get every single country in the world from Japan to Jamaica, Rwanda to Russia, to follow their made up instructions for a phony crisis, then the battle for global domination is already over and these fools shouting death threats at Anthony Fauci and other health officials have already lost the war.  Because anyone with the power to control the actions of every government in the world with a phony crisis, isn’t worried about a few fools crying about a “deep state” or worrying about a vaccine that hasn’t even been developed yet."

There is much anger and despair, channeled deceptively by the media into partisan hatred over cultural differences while the political elite of both parties mostly agree on the need to funnel taxpayer dollars to powerful special interests, like the military and Wall Street. There is no democratic outlet for this despair because the corporate media gatekeepers weed out any candidates for high office who threaten the economic status quo."

This can not continue on a downward trajectory.  The consequences are hard to imagine."
2020-06-23 16:23,"I identify as a political conservative in many respects.  Perhaps I should use the past tense, because the behavior of many of fellow citizens is making me rethink my views.

I'm also done trying to be nice about public health. I'm not an expert, but I also know what I don't know, and therefor consulted my medical and scientific friends. And I follow the guidelines, one and all for the sake of my fellow citizens.

Alas, a public health crisis has somehow turned what should have been a unifying moment into a battle of informed v. ill-informed. And too many of my (former) political compatriots are simply on the wrong side of this battle, the wrong side of science, and the wrong side of what will be the history of pandemics.

This crisis is not about freedom, or commerce, or liberty, or rugged individualism.  This crisis is and should be about science, kindness, a compelling government interest to protect the public, and plain common decency.

We are the laughing stock of the world, and rightly so. Leave our public health heroes alone to do their work.  Stop acting like babies. And just wear a darned mask for yourself and for the good of others.  Think of it like holding a door for someone; a minor inconvenience of common courtesy."
2020-06-23 17:01,"It was ever thus, sadly. As an historian of public health, the first attacks on public health advocates (in Mass.) was by... doctors!  They opposed more public, scientific approaches which disturbed their income from patients. 

It is no surprise perhaps when there is a strong anti-science streak in US society. Remembering that around 42 percent of the population, according to reliable survey, think the Earth is less than 10 000 years old. So much for guarding against communicable disease; communicable ignorance may be even worse. 

It starts with the education system, I have to say. Children need to formulate and debate ideas, concepts and their understanding of reality. So often it is about learning conformism. Frankly, that also why you have Trump as the US president and Boris Johnson as PM in the UK."

I completely get the urgent need to re-open; the fear and concern that people and families are going to get devastated by the economic hardships is very real.

What is wrong with these people?"

Our current ""president"" , who encourages this behavior, is simply the culmination of this attitude. To have a public health system at all, we must try to care about each other. If we can't do that, any attempt to stem the spread of this virus - or any other pandemic that comes along - will be futile."

2020-06-23 16:33,"In every speech, Trump has encouraged this pro-death agenda, minimizing the role of science in protecting Americans, making fun of wearing PPE’s, ridiculing social distancing and, now, suggesting that the pandemic numbers would come down if we just stopped collecting data about deaths and infections. So these attacks on public health professionals are very much linked to Trump’s re-election campaign.  It’s utterly shameful."
2020-06-23 17:05,"This is more evidence of the vacuum of leadership that engulfs the White House and consequently infects the country. An even barely competent President would have taken much of the edge off this crisis by saying and doing competent things. Instead, the uniformed and hostile rhetoric with which the President engages the country has poisoned the atmosphere and made everything seem more intractable than it really is.

Other countries, possessed of even minimally competent leadership, have weathered the pandemic in much better shape than we have. There’s a lesson there."
2020-06-23 16:41,"For those of you who point to a political affiliation...this is not about politics, Donald Trump, the GOP, etc. This is about the great American cultural icon; individualism.

Hey buddy, it's for OUR protection, not yours. Individualism is why we don't have universal healthcare, education. etc. Why should my money pay for someone else's such and such. Typical American."

The personally unaccountable people who choose to intrude their beliefs, for which they have a right underpinned by our democracy, by threatening words and violating actions. into the wellbeing and health of other individuals, ranging in roles local to national news to be stopped.
Quickly. Effectively. In ways which do not (permanently?)violate their bodies, psyches or spirit.These fellow Americans can not be allowed, by the relevant mandated public authorities, to interfere with necessary treatment and prevention efforts which target both selected people as well as families, neighborhoods and communities.Their beliefs, transmuted into random and planned reactions, and not in responses underpinned caring Menschlichkeit, can not be enabled to continue to threaten a range of health systems and sites from being able to be effective. Increases in incidences and prevalences of a lethal virus challenges hospitals capacities and their staff’s strengths.
Relevant policymakers,as well as the rest of us trying to overcome this pandemic are now faced by a double, interacting, toxic reality:the actual virus which currently is inadequately understood, and a virulent “I can do and say what I want,” with impunity, human threat. Both need to be controlled."
2020-06-23 16:41,"I believe our health officials have done an excellent job over the last four months in warning people of the dangers they face by not following the C.DC. guidelines. But, risking their lives by continuing to issue warnings is not worth it. Too many Americans are knowingly and needlessly risking their lives and they appear unwilling to minimize the risk.  What responsible citizens can do therefore is minimize or end our association with them and adhere to the guidelines as best as we can. 

If the deniers care so little about their lives, being fully aware of the risks they are taking, who are to judge?"

Americans are sociopaths hellbent on doing what we want when we want and we will not be inconvenienced by the simply humane act of distancing and masking up.  I have never been cursed at in my life as much as these days when I ask someone approaching me to wear a mask or move aside.  And I have been a social justice activist for over 40 years.

* You have people that prefer denial to truth 
* You have people that only accept facts that fit their particular political or worldview
* You have people that don't accept facts as absolute
* You have people that don't accept the views of subject matter experts
* You have people that use social media as their primary source of information
* You have people that are essentially ignorant but that believe themselves to be well informed
  
(Note the above are not in any particular order and that some people may be in several, or all, of the groups listed).

In short, we are in a period of unparalleled learning, with new advances being made in areas as diverse as particle physics, quantum computing and AI, but where it seems as if the knowledge levels of the general population is regressing rapidly.  This seems to be exacerbated by leaders such as Donald Trump, Mitch McConnell, Bill Barr et al, campaigning by vested interests such as the Koch and DeVos families, and ""media"" such as Fox & Friends, Infowars etc.

Is the 21st Century heralding the decline of the USA despite the advantages of leadership in so many key industries?  Is it entering an age of ignorance where people opt to ignore any inconvenient truths, create their own echo chambers and try to pretend nothing else exists?  If so the decline into irrelevance will be rapid as the rest of the world will have to move on regardless.  

Is Nov 2020 the last chance to save it?"

We are proud of our public health officer because she has successfully led us down the curve. With a population of just over 5 million, we had only 2822 people test positive and currently have only 182 active cases (as of June 23).

These miscreants are going beyond ""free speech."" They are threatening the lives of public officials. They should be arrested, and at minimum be forced to read actual science on the spread of this virus.

2020-06-23 17:48,"I live in NJ, in one of the bedroom communities of NYC. We got hit as hard as NYC (but of course everyone says “NYC”). It was awful, and has been hard to bring the deaths down, but we’ve done it and don’t want to go back. 

I was talking with a colleague in rural Kansas and he casually asked how things were. His tone was light-hearted and kinda skeptical. I told him. In straightforward terms about the deaths, field hospitals, ambulances diverted because of no more room, body bags piling up, whole families losing multiple members, and pretty much the entire generation over 80 gone. 

He was stunned and I think I scared him almost to death. He just didn’t connect what was on TV to real people. 

I then looked up Kansas vs NJ stats on COVID. At the time, they had about 250 deaths to our 12,000 or so. If the death rate in Kansas has been the same as NJ, they would have had over 4,000 deaths. No wonder this feels like an overreaction to some people. 

The next few weeks will be crucial. It takes weeks for the deaths to be reflected after infection. These rural counties are much older on average than the places that have been ravaged early on. 

Will these people finally, finally get it when Kansas loses 5000 people in a month?"

For a while her neighbors formed a protective line around her property in an effort to protect her, but unfortunately, the gun-toting, camo-wearing crowd overpowered them.

It wore Amy down to the point where, for her family's safety, she resigned.

Overall, I have great respect for the way the medical and epidemiological experts have handled this. 

But I continue to object to the lack of better and more consistent information (and product) about cloth face masks. 

1).  Why isn't there better and far more consistent, useful, information available about cloth face masks, re efficacy, construction (like layers), materials,  etc?

2).  Why in the WORLD aren't there FDA APPROVED masks that people can buy with reasonable assurance that they understand to what extent, ROUGHLY, the masks they are buying protect themselves and others.  (With whatever list of  variables / uncertainties needs to be included)?

3).  Instead, the public gets to pick their source, wild claims, filters, layers, sizes, materials, vents, pockets, etc. ALL OVER THE MAP, with little real clue what's actually best.  (Though we have been ""treated"" to a variety of opinions and conflicting studies on what is best -- which from what I've seen is also ALL OVER THE MAP).  

I believe in science.  But this is frustrating enough to me that I can understand why people who are leery about science aren't trusting of the efficacy of such masks, given the state of the data and products, overall."
2020-06-23 18:24,"There is a eye-opening article in the June 22nd edition of Time magazine titled “Which countries have handled COVID-19 best?”

Of course the USA is no where to be found, here are the countries:

Total cases / Deaths

Canada 95,269 / 7,717
Argentina 20,197 / 608
Iceland 1,806 / 10
United Arab Emirates 37,018 / 273
Greece 2,952 / 180
Australia 7,252 / 102
South Korea 11,668 / 273
Taiwan 443 / 7
New Zealand 1,504 / 22
Singapore 37,183 / 24

The one difference all these countries have compared to the USA is they all have a competent leader who listens to the health experts and conveys that to their citizens. Unfortunately, we have a “leader” who is the complete opposite."
2020-06-23 18:50,Why are the police or the FBI not arresting the people who are doxing and trolling and physically threatening our public health officials?

2020-06-23 18:39,"I find it sad to read stories such as this. And it strikes me how different the pandemic experience is in the US and Canada. During normal times the differences between the two countries seem pretty small. But the pandemic sure feels different here and I attribute it to the messaging, the safety net, and the lack of polarization among the electorate. Lose your job? You can still go to the doctor and fill prescriptions. There are no Florida-like horror stories of overloaded websites that deny people unemployment insurance. No UI? There's an alphabet soup of generous new benefits that kick in. Wear a mask? Go ahead, it's not a political statement in Canada.

One more difference: we don't have Fox news."

2020-06-23 19:56,"We can blame this administration for these blatant attacks targeting our much needed health officials. Trump was more concerned about his re-election and Wall Street and not about the welfare of American citizens. 

His Secretary of Education, Betsy Devos’ family helped to finance the ‘liberty protest’ in an effort to re-open the country. This has led to many of the violent confrontation of our health official all over this country.  

Trump and his administration made this pandemic political. And because of it many more will die as many follow his lead as infections continue to rise. Trump promised to run the country like his businesses. He has succeeded because the entire country has become bankrupted by his leadership or the lack there of."

Those frustrated and fearful of COVID-19 are taking it out on the messenger, who is only sharing her data and making her public health assessments based upon the numbers. Dr. Ferrer is responsible for the public health guidelines for more than 10 million people. In a no-win job, she has been remarkable."
2020-06-23 21:50,This attitude starts from the top.  The federal response has been worse than incompetent; it has been nonexistent.  And the public health officials are thrown under the bus. I guess exceptionalism goes both ways.

2020-06-23 22:37,"Everyone who allies themselves with personal freedoms instead of civil obedience to the authority and expertise of public health ought to sign a waiver that they will not seek medical care from any institution of health care.    They can exercise their alternative life styles with the shaman of their own stripe.   

Personal freedoms need to come with a price, not paid by those who adhere to common sense.   When everyone does better, every body does better.    When people splinter off on their own, they bring down themselves and everyone who has to care for them."
2020-06-24 0:34,"Unfortunately, these people will not believe COVID-19 is real until they or someone close to them gets seriously ill.  And by then, that person will have spread the virus.  As long as Faux News ignores the seriousness of the virus, and  keeps spreading conspiracies, these people will continue to go after health care officials.  Remember, they see anyone who's competent as a member of the ""Deep State.""

All we can do is to keep pointing out the facts, the contradictions of their position, and ask if they will not seek medical care if they become ill.  It won't do any good, of course, but it can keep you from going crazy.  And be sure to send notes of encouragement to the beleagered health officials."

We just have to clear away the professional organization lobbies."
2020-06-23 13:28,"Political messaging is a bit confusing.

President Trump is apparently the boogie-man again because he is pro United States and against Obama-era climate change measures and yet the United States has a surplus of food to sell to—pork and soy hungry—China, which is building one coal-fired plant after another. If we destroyed Greta’s childhood, how come our food production is so high? How is it that Chinese coal-fired plants are considered good? 

Meanwhile our friends at PeTA roll their eyes at our industrial pork farming methods, wherein “Pork Lives Don’t Matter”, because we keep them pigs im cages. But, true to the human glutinous race, the only good pig is a dead pig in the eyes of the law. If we only could talk to the animals. Apparently pigs are really good at rejuvenating farmland if it’s done right but they have to be let out of their cages to run around according to a scientific sinus curve.

Now we have to wait for August for former VP Biden to announce a running mate, but by that time Covid-19 (caused by animals) will have probably mutated to Covid-19b, wherein we all can vote by mail from our hospital beds.

Yep, 2020 is special."

Do the markets ""believe"" Trump because so many transactions are now done by computer algorithms that just input ""trade deal reached"" but lack the human understanding of ""yeah...but it's Trump saying that"". I wonder.

 So does everyone realise that Trump is so pathetically desperate that at this point he'll agree to whatever morsel China gives him? Do people understand that he will accept even worse conditions and abuses on trade then we had 4 years ago out of desperation?

Have people puzzled out the correlation of Trump endangering our national security to remove sanctions and criminal charges against the Chinese company ZTE, which got busted funneling our technology to Iran and North Korea, in exchange for Ivanka's voting machine patents? Think those patents have something to do with why Trump is terrified of voting by mail even during a global pandemic?? Congress stepped in to prevent Trump from removing those sanctions. Ivanka still got her patents. Mark my words Donald Trump and the treasonous Republican party will force this country to remove them with a bullet not a ballot. They will tear apart the republic. 

Trump has gone all in with accepting foreign hostile entities to retain himself in office. I don't think he's even trying to hide it anymore. It's in our enemies interest to keep him in the Whitehouse. He makes this country weak and disgraced."

That being said, what innovation is Facebook providing that grows our economy?  Their business model is to intercept advertising dollars from other sources that spend money to create content- Facebook suckers its users into creating the content for free.    Amazon is basically bullying their vendors  to drive prices lower, and bullying their warehouse workers to work harder for the same or lower pay.  Is that real innovation?"

The HI Visa workers are paid about half of what the American workers are paid.  This is why all of the tech companies want it, not because they can't find the American workers, it's they don't want to pay them.  My husband had to train his Indian replacement in his last job. When it comes to high tech workers this is just a game to pay workers less.  If they made companies pay the going wage for these H1 Visa worker you would see more companies hiring Americans!

Today, with the thousands of unemployed Americans, it is preposterous foreign workers come to take the jobs from Americans. Let the big tech companies hire local talent, or better yet TRAIN black and Latino young people. It would be a win-win for everyone. Does the high tech industry really support BLM? Then they should show it in their recruiting and hiring practices to benefit local youth instead of bringing foreign workers."
2020-06-23 15:04,"What about nurses and doctors?  Does Trump hope to exclude them as well and have unemployed pipe fitters from the rust belt take over their duties as the drop like flies from CV19?

Does Trump hope a plan to make health insurance unavailable to those affected by the pandemic will go over in the trailer parks and boardrooms of America?

Is part of his brilliant strategy to make work in the USA for sub market wages and also no healthcare so unappealing that those little brown people won’t even want to come here, cheering the retired farmers of Idaho and Kansas?

Taking a step back, all Republican policies only seem to be about appealing to the minority Trump base.  In fact, the ultimate goal is to appeal to finance casino operators on Wall Street who look forward to short term market improvements as businesses are forced to cut labor costs and institute a modern day serfdom."
2020-06-23 16:02,"Will we see companies spend money on training their current employees if they cannot bring in people on visas? Probably not.  Will we see any progress on improving our wealth care system so it's a real medical care system that works for all of us?  Not while McConnell and the GOP are running things. Will employers provide employees, all of them, even the gig employees, with enough sick time to cover COVID19 and any other illnesses they may come down with in the next few years?  I doubt it.  

In other words, it's going to be business as usual for employers while employees bear the brunt of the costs from using up sick time, being forced to pay for a test to prove they have or don't have COVID19, and also being quarantined if exposed to another person with it.  

Just as the recoveries from recessions hasn't included Main Street or most employees, the protections put in place by employers, coupled with waivers they want employees to sign, will be, at most, cosmetic.  

As usual, America does the easiest things rather than digging in and making the necessary changes that will allow all employees to take time off when they are ill rather than coming into work, and that will allow people to receive medical care when and where they need it instead of when they can afford it."

2020-06-23 17:46,What the pandemic is proving is that remote work actually works for many information technology roles.  Companies like twitter have already announced permanent work from home policies as a new standard. Amazon has shared that productivity for such roles has increased.  I work with smaller firms who are embracing remote work as a way to access qualified talent from a broader labor pool and save money.  More of this is on the horizon and portends massive change in how our society is organized.  What roles truly need to be “based in” a specific city? Furthermore what roles need to be based in the United States?   Cutting off H1Bs will most certainly increase offshoring.  But that would likely have happened anyway.  The market for talent is ahead of immigration policy.
2020-06-23 17:53,"The technology companies have plenty of American talent to hire, so it is not true this will stifle innovation.  I work in the tech industry and H1B workers are used as indentured servants because they cannot stay here if they switch jobs and they are slightly cheaper.  In turn, it creates less opportunity for young Americans just graduating when these visas go to foreigners.  Don’t just repeat tech CEO talking points.  Let’s look at the data in a few months."

The latest developments in distributed and cloud based technologies mean two things. 1. demand for those skills will continue to increase. 2. the opportunity and motivation for US companies to employ foreign workers remotely will also dramatically increase.

Finally, the notion that H1b workers bring down salaries, or take US jobs is a fallacy. No doubt some 'body shops' had been abusing the system, but most of them have been forced out by stricter background checks.

1)  The ban doesn't affect too many foreign workers.  If you are in the US as of June 24th, or have a valid visa stamp, you are not affected.  This is the vast majority of H1B applicants, as they are changing their status from OPT to H1B.  The OPT visa is a much larger issue, as it's valid for a year and renewable for up to 2 more years while the employer seeks to get the OPT employee on an H1B.  Once on the H1B, the promise of a green card is dangled in front of the employee, which then becomes tied to the employer while going through the PERM and I-140 process.  Once the I-140 has been approved for 180 days, the employee is free to switch employers without loosing his or her place in the green card queue.  It takes many years to get to this stage, and *that* is the reason why the employers love H1Bs;  they are essentially tied to the employer, or risk starting the PERM process all over again.

2)  There is no shortage of US based STEM talent.  If there were, the US wouldn't have the leadership in aerospace and defense industries, which exclusively employ US citizens with a security clearance.  Ditto for US national labs; Lawrence Livermore, Los Alamos, Oak Ridge, etc.  Of course, the labs employ exceptional foreign nationals as well.  Foreign nationals who should have no issues obtaining an O-1 visa."
2020-06-23 18:35,"Low paid highly skilled workers pay a fraction of the taxes that highly skilled US workers would have paid. The system defunds Main Street. The flow on effect explains why US teachers are forced to buy their own school supplies by the communities where they work. Maybe US kids can get their education on line, tethered to a screen, from South Korea, or Singapore, or Finland or India so they can compete for jobs in the US, too."
2020-06-23 18:45,"As a h1-b recipient during the 2008 crash, I'm not sorry I potentially took a job from a home grown American. I was a better candidate for the job and got it, despite it being more work for my employer to go through all the legal hoops to get me hired. 

Just also want to point out, I've paid taxes since I started working here and contributed to your social security system. Will I ever see that back when I retire as an immigrant? Nope. But I don't complain, we never do. But while y'all sit there claiming America will be fine without skilled immigrant labor, I'd look at who actually supports your universities, social security and service fields that are filled by majority by immigrants/POC. 

The mentality that others are less deserving of an opportunity, simply because they were born outside of some artificially created border is nationalistic, racist, and self-serving. You cannot call yourself a liberal and agree with these visa restrictions."
2020-06-23 18:47,"The USA is/are awash with holders of the H1 visa who dominate the information technology sector. It is outrage. No other country in the world permits the direct replacement of domestic workers by foreign nationals for literally no reason other than possible the cost of employing the foreign nationals. The H1 visa program should not exist. All one has to do is walk into the information technology offices of large companies, such as large USA banks to see the astonishing dominance of Indian-origin workers. Many do not have any skill whatsoever at speaking or writing USA-version of English. They are incomprehensible in most cases for a native USA English speaker. The arguments about ""innovation"" are laughable. Facebook? Twitter? Other social media? LinkedIn? Worse than the drivel that is broadcast on television. The programming artifacts produced by some of these companies have usually been provided to the world-wide open source community. Many useful artifacts for dealing with huge amounts of data and for distributed computing that have more general applicability. But the useful programming artifacts are a side note to the main goal of exploiting the data for people in order to sell advertising to the same people. Consumer advertising is a bane on any society."
2020-06-23 18:48,I never approved of anything Trump has done but this one I believe he accidentally hit the mark.  The tech companies for years have been abusing the H-1B visas to increase the labor market in the USA so they could force workers to compete in their Hunger Games environment. If the tech companies want the H-1B visas workers then stop firing their staff.
2020-06-23 18:58,"Alternatively, Americans can educate Americans for these jobs  in American Innovation, rather than relying on Foreign Governments to pay to educate their students only to loose them to overseas jobs in American Innovation. The glaring elephant in the room is that Americans refuse to pay for pre-school and 
they refuse to fully fund universities. Wall Street does not want to pay full freight to educate their own people, they want to poach them already educated. The world wasn't completly tuned in to the job linked realities of the US health care system until recently. Maybe VISA applications are down, and Trump is saving face. He lies about everything else."
2020-06-23 19:26,"Tech companies have never cared about us or their workers. They certainly don’t when it comes to using h1b visas to get rid of American workers. In Germany,  for example, companies help fund and train workers so they have a steady supply of qualified people. Here we defund education which leads to a work force mostly unqualified to do anything but flip burgers. Then the tech companies go over seas and get cheaper foreigners to replace the few american workers they employ at a discount rate. This program has been abused for decades and should be ended and our education system forced to prepare workers for US jobs. With record unemployment it is shameful that a program like this exists at all. This is a win for trump and the American worker."
2020-06-23 19:53,"have to say agree with trump on this. i dont think the issue is the students hired from American universities. the h1b issue is when disney or some other company outsources their whole it operation to wipro, not providing severance until they train their replacements etc. maybe the us and business can come to a compromise on this and not give h1b's to the massive outsourcers until they can prove there is not a qualified american candidate for the role , but continue to hire the best candidates from american universities.  and lets see some more stem scholarships to increase the number of American candidates."
2020-06-23 20:06,"What's unclear from this article and I can't find on the internet is how this changes visas for medical education.  The U.S. has foreign residents/internets/fellows who are here on J-1 or H-1s.  They're pretty integral to most hospitals, and a lot of them stay in the U.S. after residency and take jobs in very underserved areas, working toward a green card and, eventually, citizenship.  It's quite a good bargain for the U.S. overall -- you get good foreign MDs, train them up in the American system, and get cheap(er) labor working in underserved areas, plus all the taxes they pay over the years of working."
2020-06-23 20:13,"Just a reminder that our mass unemployment was caused by the pandemic.  No pandemic?  we'd still be at 3.9% unemployment.

2020-06-23 20:52,"Why doesn’t American lobby equally as hard for real education reform and funding equality?

Why do we insist on depending on foreign talent to make up for the appalling lack of it coming from our own education institutions. 

It is amazing that we have to import highly skilled talent being paid six figure salaries in science, finance, tech and services yet....have millions of Americans wanting to turn to socialism because of the lack of jobs and income inequality.

Trump Winery, also known as Trump Vineyard Estates, LLC, is seeking the workers under the federal H-2 visa program, which allows US employers to hire foreign laborers on a temporary basis as long as no qualified US workers want the jobs.

These are by far and away the most vulnerable among us. In this manner, the majority of the population can adhere to social distancing (the number one weapon we have) and wear masks and restart the economy.  In doing so, we can slow down dramatically the human suffering collateral damage that the lockdown is directly responsible for ... according to the Brookings Institute over seven million children now experiencing malnutrition (many will now have lifelong learning damage), skyrocketing domestic violence according to the UN, etc.  Why?"

Whether spreading the disease is a problem depends on how vulnerable you feel.  Clearly, it's a choice between humanity vs capitalism.  Empathy is risky.  And, as Darwin said, nature will eventually prevail anyway. The sick and elderly are always an economic drag and there are plenty of other excuses.  It just depends on what kind of country we want.  Indeed, the country is at risk, but it's not because we are too empathetic."

2020-06-23 12:21,"So what can we expect from doctors Anthony Fauci and Robert Redfield? I expect that the scorned and banned Dr. Fauci, who's now persona non grata from the Trump administration for his frank and candid assessments of the president's indifference to the coronavirus, will answer questions that might be designed to have him removed from office.

When the president jokes about the need for testing, which he did just a few nights ago, he gives the impression that any precaution against the spread of COVID-19 is, to him, a personal affront, an insult of tremendous magnitude. I am hoping that Dr. Fauci will repeat his recent assertions that there should be no college or professional football this fall because the virus is a predator and will not be defeated by anything but a vaccine. That, Dr. Fauci has said often, is months to years away.

I'm more suspicious of what Dr. Redfield might say to contradict Dr. Fauci. The CDC's funding depends upon the whims of an administration that his hostile towards science and medicine and research. Anything that aids the health and well-being of Americans is not something this administration cares very much about.

When the president says ""increased screening was revealing more infections, making the country look bad,"" what he meant was that increasing awareness of my irresponsibility in this matter is eating into my political support.

We must hope that the House subcommittee will ask probing, biting questions of its witnesses."
2020-06-23 12:27,"""He added that while Sweden was not striving for so-called herd immunity, the higher level of immunity “is contributing to lower numbers of patients needing hospitalization, as well as fewer deaths per day.”
   If this is true, poorer countries like India and Bangladesh should remove strict lockdowns, since it is impossible to continue with strict lockdowns and let their people go free and hope for a higher level of immunity or herd immunity to happen. 
  I hope the W.H.O can confirm that the Swedish approach is the right one."

Wouldn’t you want to do everything in your power to protect those you care about?

Turns out it doesn’t take many misinformed people to pack a restaurant or bar. One modestly-sized family party can become a catalyst for transmission.

For tech to have any role here, we would first need a unified electronic health record system, so covid test results could flow to an app. Even then, that would require a huge increase in testing availability. Lastly, we need to focus on testing people with no symptoms and trusting that those with symptoms will either self isolate or go to the hospital if necessary."

2020-06-23 12:52,"Against the rising tide of COVID cases in 23 states and the rising strain on many hospitals’ ability to cope, Dr. Fauci’s testimony is highly likely to cut against Trump’s denial to the virus’ continuing threat, as well as his push for full-scale reopening of “his” economy—and thus to his mind, his re-election prospects.  How could this president possibly stomach such “disloyalty”?  Hasn’t he already signaled that he will do absolutely anything so secure that re-election—from strong-arming the Ukrainian president to investigate Biden to begging the Chinese one to buy soybeans to shutting down any and every investigation into his possible wrongdoing?

When Pence was on board, at least trump’s incompetence could be managed but it now appears the VP has also jumped ship, probably in a useless attempt to save his place on the ticket. Responsibility for fighting the pandemic was long ago delegated to the States.

Instead of the obvious, there should be public hearings about how trump and Mnuchin are spending, or not spending, funds authorized by Congress to fight the pandemic. We know trump is sitting on funds intended for PPEs and funeral assistance for those who have died (many needlessly), while handing out money to those who don’t need it (why ever would that be?). That’s what I want to hear about."

2020-06-23 14:25,"Success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm............. Winston Churchill.

Dr. Fauci has been testifying to Congress for the past 35 years. He has developed a knack of testifying before congress by talking and talking without saying anything that is actionable. Of the 3 major pandemics of this century, the HIV pandemic, Swine Flu pandemic and the COVID-19 pandemic we have not had a vaccine against any of them during the peak period of the pandemic. Yes there was a vaccine against the Swine Flu after the pandemic had almost been booted out and people who were infected either had passed away or people like me just suffered the symptoms of the flu and acquired immunity, the hard way before the vaccine became available in abundance. Reminds me of a warrior who was a great warrior until the war started. Yes the Swine flu vaccine was great after everyone who could have benefited either died or survived on their own. 

COVID-19 is very different; it has caused such death and destruction and if we do not have a deployable vaccine in 100s of millions of doses with the urgency of now, or latest by the end of August, the experts will have failed miserably. If I am one of those in congress before whom Dr. Fauci and Dr. Redfield are going to testify. I would be grilling them like a sheesh kabab. Yesterday I was picking up my omega pearls thru the drive through window and I asked when can I get the COVID-19 vaccine and the pharmacist responded Oct. Hope."

2020-06-23 14:30,"Of course we're seeing more cases - that's what was bound to happen when people come into contact with more people.  We can't stop the virus - it is with us (and the rest of the world).  So, we need to find a way to reopen as much as possible without overrunning the healthcare system.

It's a shame that putting on a mask has become politicized.  It's so low effort!  Maybe if everyone wore masks we would not see such an increase in cases.  No one wants to be shut down.  It makes no sense to whine about personal freedoms with respect to wearing a mask when the likely consequence is greater restrictions on your so-called freedoms when everything has to shut down.

Wear a mask in public.  Try to avoid touching your face in public.  Wash your hands frequently.  If you are not socially distancing for whatever reason, try not to visit with your at-risk family and friends.  This is probably the best we can do without a coordinated national response."
2020-06-23 14:38,"I don't like the lockdowns, don't like wearing a mask.  Nobody does.  But they are necessary and I don't think anything has changed.  We don't have a vaccine, we don't have a proven treatment, and we still really don't know that much about how the virus operates.  

The optimistic view is that younger people may test positive but most will be asymptomatic or have just a mild case, those at risk are the elderly who only need to practice social distancing and they will be fine.  However, do we really know that is true.  And even if it is close to true, we don't know what impact having CV will have in the long term.  

So what makes us think that things will somehow change as we open up, that the virus will simply go away?  The only thing that's really changed is that time has passed, which is irrelevant.  As we open up, it's going to get harder to keep your social distance.  Imagine riding in the NYC subway (awful to begin with) -- you wear your mask but if you're cheek to jowl with others have much protection does a mask really offer?  

To some extent, we're trading a higher risk of infection and morbidity for economic recovery and individual sanity -- and that may be the right trade.  But the infection rate will continue going up."

2020-06-23 14:42,"Our leaders have difficult, perhaps impossible, choices to make as they decide whether or not to lift the lockdowns.  Balance is necessary.

The lockdowns do not allow immunity to develop, so it is expected that case rates will rise as lockdowns are lifted. Importantly, the lockdowns prevented our healthcare system from being overwhelmed: this was their primary goal, and it was accomplished.

The good news is that the death rates due to the virus, at least so far, have not started to rise again.  Medical science has gotten better at managing serious cases, and many of the vulnerable, including seniors and those with chronic conditions, are continuing to isolate.  Most people are, appropriately, wearing masks, and masks are now available.

There are extraordinarily serious consequences to Draconian lockdowns.  The collapse of the world economy has produced  mass hunger and starvation; vaccination programs for diseases other than covid are on hold.  The US today depends on world trade and foreign production for many, many essential supplies and products.  Most of our medicine, for example, comes from China.

So, it is past time to lift some of the restrictions.  Masks should be mandatory in many circumstances, and mass gatherings like major sporting events should be on hold.  Seniors should socially distance more than younger, less vulnerable, individuals.  But in many regards it is essential we reopen our economy, and allow limited social activity.

Let us hope for a vaccine."

People in the Bangor area were, for a while, wearing masks but more and more are not lately.  I went to an area about an hour and a half away (Monson) which is Trump country on Saturday and there was no one wearing a mask at the gas station I stopped at (except me and my partner).  Most of the cars, though, had CT or MA plates.  Went to a Lowes yesterday and it was about half and half.

That's not going to get us where we have to get to defeat the spread of this virus.  But too many Americans have the 'Don't even try to make me' and, of course, our president leads the way on that.

Those in belief of those theories will discard the mask and not practice other recommendations to prevent the spread of coronavirus and that is part of the problem. 
Politicians are a large contributor to the problem in succumbing to the toxic tweets of the President* and his discounting science and reopened to possibly avoid Trump’s wrath. 
We now see the results of the actions of our elected officials. 
I agree the country needs to get the unemployment rate down and allow businesses to allow commerce. But, is the cost too high?

And, I'm the first to admit that he may be ""right"" (to an extent ... and ON OCCASION) ""for the wrong reasons.""

But he and others like him DID have a critical decision to make by April Fool's Day - should we accord a high enough priority to saving lives to risk a decade like the US had in the 1930's ... or should we accord a high enough priority to ""saving the economy"" so that we'd zip up to 100,000 lives lost and the likelihood of many more to come?

OF COURSE, better policies and implementation and staffing in D.C. would have moved the needle, so that we'd have kept the ill & dying numbers way down, ... but I stand by belief that EVERY COUNTRY where the numbers got big simply HAD TO face that choice ... and pick between the one and the other.

Whether Italy will EVER have a viable economy - and my sympathy for them is almost unbounded - is unknowable at this time.

But the fact that Trump still has - look at gambling websites - at least a 40% chance of being re-elected is not JUST an indication of a country with poor education and various forms of mental illness (among his supporters.)

However, as long as we have a president who is stuck, and I mean permanently stuck on NOT believing them, their intel or science in general, then we will NEVER be in a proactive state or even ahead of the curve when it comes to keeping people safe from this virus.

The indifference and arrogance of this president regarding this virus continues to cost more and more lives.  Presently, over 120,000 individuals have perished from COVID-19.  And instead of getting with the program, folks like Trump remain on their rump, in utter denial.

They confined people to their homes except to step outside to smoke. They closed markets, requiring food and meals to be delivered to domiciles. 

Officials automatically detained anyone (infected or not) who left their own city and tried to return, transporting them (infected or not) to government camps for 40 days of strictly enforced quarantine.

If he or any other Federal level public health official leaves their posts, even in protest, Trump will appoint ignorant lackeys, as he did with Azar.  Protests and justified statements of indignation mean nothing to Trump.  In fact, this indignation seems to embolden Trump as well as his followers.  And the smarter, more respected the person is who quits in protest, the more Trump’s followers love it and the more Trump cries victimization.

But then Trump said it would be redirected  towards safety and reopening in addition to developing vaccines and therapeutics (Wikipedia).

I do believe the scientists on the task force only served to mitigate, not the virus, but some of Trump's ridiculous statements. There was no Administration efforts for the task force to coordinate. So the task force was a sham and the scientists on the force should have said as much.

The task force needed representation from the CDC, our national public health institution. Unfortunately, the task force substituted  Fauci's NIH for the CDC. They are not interchangeable parts.

As far as I know there was no masking or social distancing program in place and absolutely no antibiotics to treat the pneumonia that killed so many victims of that flu. She died in October which means it was the reoccurrence of the disease.

In all of the above circumstances, I have seen friends and colleagues die tragically and the greater good steamroll along.

Coronavirus doesn’t figure into the greater good. There is no latitude in the capitalist agenda that allows for it, especially where that agenda is construed by hardline conservatism. So, the response is to largely ignore it, let people die, while maximising the profits. Of course, without people there are no producers or consumers so the economy dies a slower, more protracted death.

America reopened too early, a morbid dystopia beckons. All it took was discipline, cooperation, and compassion to avoid it. Instead Chauvin killed Floyd, Trump gassed protesters in his path. Fauci and Birx let their boss muse about injecting disinfectant into bodies.

Imagine no struggles with shame, not a single one in your whole life, no matter what kind of selfish, lazy, harmful, or immoral action you had taken … You can do anything at all, and still your strange advantage over the majority of people, who are kept in line by their consciences, will most likely remain undiscovered.""

Come November, the American people who will responsibly exercise their right to vote can change this dire picture to one of hope. Installing Joe Biden in the Oval Office and replacing Republicans with Democrats will give us a fighting chance to fix the many, many threats that we face, domestically and globally. 

Russia, China, North Korea, Iran, the Northern Triangle, and many South American and African nations, which are enemies of or uncertain about the U.S., will be watching to see if we get back to being the United States of America that is the strong global leader we were before the destroyer tht was installed in the White House in 2016 by Vladmir Putin."

A society who has a well functional top public educational system, a health care system that is focusing on prevention, an infrastructure that is built to protect our environment, our climate and detects early dangerous pathogens, and most importantly, a society that regards every human being as equal has a good chance to fight against outbreaks like the one we experience right now.

What we witnessing right now is an administration that has lost any(!) credibility because of its unimaginable incompetence and insanity. 

I hope, that Joe Biden will have the biggest electoral victory in US history, that the house and senate will have solid democratic majorities allowing a quick repair of what the current administration has destroyed over the last three years - and yet to work on all the priorities our society needs to have on place in order to start healing."

(And, in the end, many of those resources may prove to have been key elements of a vaccine or cure that will liberate the world from this scourge)

However, with 4% of the world's population, we have had between 20% and 25% of the deaths. This is not a healthy response, because President Trump and the administration are damaging our responses rather than helping them. 

Against every wise admonition and directive, President Trump held a rally on Saturday that was, by far, the largest indoor gathering in the United States in months and said that he told his people to ""slow down testing"" because he didn't want them to find more cases.

Simply put, tens of thousands of our people are dying that would not have died, and our economy will remain in suspended animation longer because President Trump is politicizing truth itself, and vandalizing our ability to serve each other rather than leading."

But put someone as limited as Mr Trump as ""the leader of the free world"" and there is no chance for us. I admit, I thought it would be earthquake or war, those quaint manageable disasters that are geographically limited, but no this is the entire planet. This pandemic has completely upended life, no work, no family and friend contacts, living on dwindling savings. No cohesive leadership leaves people on their own to make their own misguided best guess how to proceed- and I am finding myself, as an older high risk person, at odds with neighbors who have ""gone back to normal"". The responsibility for this is with Trump, this is his legacy.

Narcissistic people often openly admit wrongdoing as they often momentarily forget what they need to hide as the bad act has no real emotional impact on them  (e.g. they will often blurt out details of extra-marital affairs that they forget that they need to keep secret).  What his advisors cover up as sarcasm or humour is usually just the mask slipping.  When Trump goes off-script at a rally you get a chance to glimpse what he is really thinking."

Instead of actual leadership, we get lies like the virus will just ""fade away."" Trump has outdone himself with divisiveness by politicizing social distancing and wearing a mask. Now he's headed to Arizona for campaign rallies where the virus is spiking. He'd do well to wear a hazmat suit, since he's 74 and not exactly a picture of health."

The “community organizers” will then do their part by finding enough ballots to swing the vote in their favor at the last minute—like Mayor Daley in 1960. On another front they’re trying to reduce the impact of the debates by limiting their number and scheduling them late in the season.

In fact, we have a buffoon in our top job who tries to interfere with our medical experts at every opportunity so that: they will attend rallies; spend money; discount the threats they are to huge portions of our population.

His response to the virus was NO EFFECTIVE RESPONSE except that this virus would ""fade away.""

Even as new cases continue to increase, Trump felt the need and urge to have a campaign rally in Tulsa last Saturday.

His words and actions in his alternative reality are finally coming home to roost.  People are finally waking up and NOT listening to his complain and boast false claims.

There is a reason why Dr. Fauci's approval rating continues to climb upwards - he tells the truth, even when it's harsh and brutal. He has always been honest with his findings, assumptions and predictions regarding this virus. He also offers honest and straight forward suggestions in slowing down this virus - the wearing of face masks and keeping a safe distance.

Meantime, Trump himself contributes daily to raising the already huge numbers, especially compared to the rest of the world, of human beings sick and dying--all with the single goal of keeping himself in power.

 ""Mr. Trump claimed that Covid-19 testing was overrated and suggested that Americans were wearing masks not for their own protection, but to demonstrate that they do not support him.""

Trump seems so  fixated on the notion that if you do less testing your numbers will look better that he ignores the corollary - that you then will be blind as to the spread of the virus.

Our lack of testing early on allowed the virus to be spread through the country.  Ignorance is not bliss.

His illogical fixation reminds me of the Roundtable discussion that he had with Big Pharma executives in which he asked each how long before we would have a vaccine.

2020-06-23 18:33,"I think Fauci confirmed that Trump was being sarcastic about testing.  Testing may be actually a positive for Trump because once this is over (supposing that it does end) the more cases you find, the lower your death rate.  It's also good for future mgmt to know the actual risk of infection and morbidity.   

However, we and the rest of the world  have rigged the game a little.  The social distancing, masks, quarantines have made both the natural infection and morbidity risks artificially lower than they would have been.  Unless you want to make the assumption that we can live in lockdown forever, the only thing that will stop the spread of the virus is an effective vaccine or an effective treatment.

Ultimately, however, it's the population death rate (assuming of course that those who recover aren't permanently damaged) that is critical.  Things such as the RO and morbidity rates once infected - if known -- can be used to predict what will happen re the per capita morbidity rate.    Think of it like this.  The risk of dying from rabies in the US is virtually zero.  However, if you actually get rabies death is certain.  That's unfortunate when it happens but the key thing isn't the morbidity rate for those infected, it's the population death rate.  

As for assessing our infection rate now v the ROW, we don't know the testing levels for most other countries.  We may have more cases per capita v ROW but that may be an artifact of lower testing rates elsewhere."

2020-06-23 18:33,Fear monger Fauci back at it again. He adopted a model that 2.2 million Americans would die this year. Wrong. He then pushed to quarantine HEALTHY Americans. This put forty million Americans out of work. Fauci had to then retreat from pushing more shutdowns. Now Fauci today makes no mention that the death rate is falling. Its declined tremendously since March. Fauci ignores this--so does the Left. Instead Fauci terrorizes us about young people testing positive--many asymptomatic.

His supporters believe that.  They still give him high marks.  Right wing junk propaganda on fox, hate radio amplify his venom.  For almost half the country, it's a hoax, it's exaggerated, the numbers are made up.  Most Americans have not seen it first hand, yet.

What's the big deal?""  As the numbers climb in our state I'm a lonely voice in my own household about wearing masks, keeping distance.

However to only blame conservatives for this is absurd.  Remember that liberals had no problem attending protests with thousands upon thousands of people for about three weeks.  Even if they wore masks, they were mostly standing within inches from each other.   If they are justifying this, they are either saying that 
a) They don't care if the protests spread coronavirus, it is still worth it to them to protests.  In this case, how are they any different from people who want haircuts?  The virus doesn't determine between just causes and unjust causes.  
b) They believe it is unlikely to spread coronavirus.  In this case, why is it unsafe to go to the beach with friends as long as you all wear a mask?  Why is it unsafe to even have a party in your backyard with 40 people as long as you all wear masks?  If protests with thousands are safe, why aren't these activities safe?"

How is that not the equivalent of saying “ we ( the Feds) are going to do NO testing.”  He did not need to say slow down testing, he merely had to instruct people to not fix a broken system, or tell them that was not their job.

Faucci pointed out early on the testing system was broken. And it clearly has not been fixed, nor have the feds put much energy into fixing it. Once again, Faucci is parsing his words very carefully."

Knowing however much I know of the sources of information upon which he is drawing his policy recommendations - I would say that he is indeed skewing his presentation of the best possible information out there - in favour of soft-peddling the risks, and in particular, not highlighting  sharply the potential for any ONE individual to forge yet another link in a branching chain of transmissions that will escalate dramatically unless there are other powerful mitigating factors at play.

The Trump MAGA crowd who rarely travel beyond their local community borders may applaud this development.  But any American who understand the key elements of the global economy knows this will have drastic long-term negative economic consequences for the United States.

We are, unfortunately, in a terrible bind.  The Trump Administration seems riven and directionless.  The POTUS himself is apparently incapable of acting as a true national leader who can rally Americans to adequately address this crisis.

Even if we can pin our hopes of deny Trump a second term -- we are talking about nearly seven more months of this dysfunctional disaster of a Federal administration.

2020-06-23 19:55,"""Dr. Anthony S. Fauci told lawmakers that it was important for public officials like him to wear face masks “not only because I want to protect others and to protect myself, but also to set an example.” 

I find it incredibly sad AND scary that Dr. Fauci had to actually announce to Congress the obvious - that the wearing of a face mask protects people AND sets an example rather than common sense kicking in or was assumed."
2020-06-23 20:33,"Our 7 day rolling average of new Covid infections is about to cross  30K per day.  This also happened the first week of April, about two weeks after the start of the national lockdown. We started April with 6K deaths and finished with 63K. 57K people died in April, even though that was the height of our lock down. In other words, by the time we saw the 30K new day infections in early April, the stats for future deaths were already in place, we just needed April to see them play out.
Fauci's statement of ""the following two weeks are critical"" are unfortunately very meaningless at this point. There is no concerted national effort to do anything over the next two weeks. Nothing. In fact, the only thing we seem to be doing is making things worse by reopening.
Think of all the potential deaths that just need to play out over July-August now that we've returned to the 30K+ per day new infections range. Fauci himself said that the stats on deaths lag behind the new infection cases."
2020-06-23 19:55,"Take no new actions based on Dr. Fauci's warning. If you are alive and well then continue to do what ever it is that has kept you infection free and don't travel to Europe, China or Brazil or India any time soon. They don't need your business. Avoid crowds and take long walks in parks, get fresh air and moderate sunshine and have a balanced diet with optimal protein intake. If each person stays out of the line of fire of COVID-19 with common sense and sound science, we do not need to waste time listening to politicians with no background in public health studies or even experts who have no deployable vaccines until cows come home."
2020-06-23 20:02,"Dr. Fauci has been a constant presence and reliable voice whenever public health was at risk .   There is no reason to doubt him now.   On the other hand,  we have a federal government that is known to lie to the American people on matters large and small.   The administration has abdicated all responsibility for leading the country through this crisis.   Trump is fixated on avoiding the day of reckoning by being reelected.

In Pennsylvania,  things have begun to open up,  our governor, Tom Wolf, has his hands full trying to work with our obstructionist, bloated Republican controlled legislature.  My family and most of our friends plan to proceed very carefully until we are sure things are safe.   Everyone is responsible for making decisions based on evidence.  Dr. Fauci warns us because he knows how things work and understands the risk of letting down our collective guard too soon..  He derives no personal benefit  from this."
2020-06-23 20:36,"Can someone please explain to me why Fauci, Birx et al have to date failed to show some self respect and just quit? I know, they keep saying their job is to serve the American people and they have to stay to help keep Americans safe.  But frankly, at this point, are they doing that? The Pres certainly doesn't seem to be following their advice and their messages to us aren't getting through very clearly. Wouldn't they (or if they continue to refuse to step up to plate, some other well regarded docs) be better off addressing Americans directly from a private forum?"
2020-06-23 20:04,"When you have over 122K + dead and 2M+ infected you should start with an apology but what we got was sly, coy remarks by the panel testifying before Congress. ""The next two weeks will determine.."" ""No"" answers the group to orders regarding the President's testing remarks but the order may have been give by someone else?  Watching this panel of experts what I saw was a group of scientist and Drs that have demonstrated that they have no  courage, no commitment, and were as political as they come."
2020-06-23 20:03,"Trump supporters succeeded in marginalizing Dr. Fauci. Public health is a public enemy, they say.

But Mr. Trump and his backers will do anything to save his ""seat."""
2020-06-23 20:14,"NIH was ""told"" to cancel a grant on coronavirus?  Dr. Fauci did not know why and he did not indicate who told NIH to cancel it.  It doesn't seem to have been a decision made by NIH, but rather by someone outside NIH.  This is really odd.  (about 4:13 PM EDT)"
2020-06-23 20:16,"There will be no epiphany. Lieutenant Governor of Texas Dan Patrick put it most succinctly. We are American we would rather die than adapt.

Since he and Pence are tested at least once daily as are all their visitors, here is a perfect opportunity for him to put up or shut up.  No testing at the White House so he can demonstrate just why he maybe shoulda been a doctor.  Since he is already modeling no-mask behavior, why not go all in?  After all, he doesn't kid about this, right?"

2020-06-23 21:13,"Now the EU nations don't want US visitors.

The irony of this is that in April we were scheduled for a three-week bike tour in Spain.  It was ultimately canceled as the Covid contagion raged through both Spain and the greater EU area.

Now, roles are reversed.  No one in Spain or the EU generally want us to visit.

And yet there are people here in this very Comments section who still think a pandemic is a matter of politics!

It's like an entire nation has embraced irrationality."
2020-06-23 21:19,"Can we talk?  Here is reality.  The virus is out there and not going away.  We have two options:  lockdown and destroy our economy or learn to live with it.

The lockdown did nothing to protect us from the virus. Once we emerged from our caves, many are catching the virus. The good news is that it's a younger group with mild results.

We can not escape reality. The virus is here.  The sooner we get to herd resistance, the better. The longer we draw it out, the worse it will be for everyone."

Dr. Fauci should resign and do so while identifying Trump as an unaddressed vector advancing the propagation of this pandemic.

Doing so, would be therapeutic don't you think?"
2020-06-23 21:05,"GOP wants to have power at all cost over 99%.
Trump's goal is to make money so his family can come out of bankruptcy and doom Western democratic system in favor for Putin & Xi.

Both these entities are doing very well in their goals. GOP has sold nation of ours to the benefit of few, who will fly to their private islands when time comes.

And we American people (including citizens of free world will be paying price for years to come)

Add the anti-vaccine lobbies, nationalism about the ownership and profit from vaccines and you have the makings for an even greater public health disaster on top of the worse of our lifetimes.  Oh... there is no credible voice Or authority in government remaining? Well, welcome to public health chaos in a failed state.  Congratulations to the administration and the republicans.

So much better than hearing all the drivel from Trump."
2020-06-23 21:46,"In the history of time a vaccine has never been developed so quickly. And if by some miracle they do have one, it will be produced without usual and vigorous phases of trials. That will make many (including me) wary of the vaccine. And then of course there are the massive production and distribution problems we have been told will come. So to say we will have a vaccine by New Year’s feels pandering. It makes me wonder if the administration didn’t ask him to say it to improve poll numbers and to make that point the highlight of his next rally: I will have THE vaccine developed faster than it has ever been done! You heard Dr Fauci say it! It’s exhausting to listen to all these false promises anymore."

And misleading regarding viral shedding and who can actually infect you ."

2020-06-23 22:04,"Americans need to learn to think about others instead of themselves alone.  The myth of rugged individualism is an obstacle to so many things that need to change in America.  

We need a modern medical care system rather than the fragmented and expensive wealth care system we have.

We need to start to build up the middle class rather than expecting it to support the country while the richest corporations and families demand (and get) tax breaks.  

We need to upgrade our roads, airports, railways, waterways, our communication networks.  Starting any one of these would provide jobs for people who need work.  

We need to see our government officials acting on our behalf rather than on behalf of lobbyists who do not have ours or the country's best interests in mind.  

We need to stop refusing to teach our children critical thinking, about evolution, reproduction, safe sex, our real history which includes how we exploited the Native Americans, used slavery to build the country, etc.  

If we want to be a modern country we need to act like one.  We need to create a better social safety net for all.  We must start to understand that we ARE all in this together.  A bad outcome for one can equal a bad outcome for 10 more people and it multiplies in ways that are undesirable.  

The real question is if we have the will to change.  November's results will answer a lot of those questions."
2020-06-23 22:16,"Why should Mr Biden even think of debating with Trump? There is nothing to discuss. Any debate will feed into a false equivalency: one has knowledge and experience and will be truthful and the other will continue his clown-like assertions and falsehoods, designed to shock and entertain his base. He doesn’t need any help shooting himself in the foot. 
While he’s at it, Vice-President Biden might do well to avail himself of the services of the marketing teams of the Lincoln Project, with their terrific Trump take-downs; and of Mike Bloomberg, whose Facebook ads were superb."

Same goes for our red-state governor who can't man up sufficiently to issue a simple masking order.  

Each of them may as well be watching an out-of-control drunk driver careen down the highway and refusing to call the cops.

Now, in the middle of this pandemic the world looks at the United States with a sense of disbelief and bewilderment, and no one is laughing.

Controlling the spread of this virus takes commitment, diligence and strong leadership based on science. The world looks on knowing the U.S. politicized this pandemic, and we ask why."

Science incorporates facts and the laws of physics/chemistry/economics/... and tests ideas against reality.   Einstein was able to imagine what physic's heretofore unknown rules were.  Even then his ideas were not accepted until experimental observations confirmed his new ideas.  

Trust me, President Trump you're no Einstein."

I am sure the Dr. Fauci  is being honest, but if Trump wanted to slow down testing, for God's sake, he would not be asking Dr. Fauci. He would be giving those orders to the coordination team, not one of his advisors, like Dr. Fauci.

We can credit Dr. Fauci for being literally honest, but we still cannot assume that Trump did not ask Mike Pence or someone like that, to slow the testing. And everything Pence has said about testing indicates he is in agreement with Trump on slowing down testing.

But the literal fact is that much of the reason for the new spikes can be at least in part be blamed to insufficient testing. History will show this."

Dr. Fauci warned that there would be 100,000 to 220,000 deaths with mitigation. And 1 to 2 million deaths without mitigation. 

The states opened too soon. Disregarded the CDC guidelines at the behest of Trump. Now it’s looking like the higher number of deaths may be a reality.

2020-06-23 21:41,"The only thing  that can stop the virus and enable a return to normalcy is a vaccine, and there was some very bad news on that front earlier today. Link below.

A state appeals court in Missouri upheld a $2 billion verdict and against Johnson & Johnson, over allegations that baby powder caused ovarian cancer. The verdict is likely founded on junk science, and juror sympathy to sympathic victims and their families.  There are 19,000 similar suits pending.  A few months ago, a jury awarded $8 billion to a patient who alleged unexpected side effects from anther J & J drug, Respirdol.

Johnson&Johnson is one of the major companies trying to develop a vaccine against the corona virus. Multiply $2 billion by 19,000 pending suits, and your in the multi trillion dollar ball park.  J&J may be a big company, and some readers may not like big pharmaceutical company, but the simple truth is we need them to develop, test, and manufacturer a vaccine.

During the 1970's and 80's, trial lawyers nearly shut down vaccine production in the US, only a last minute no-fault liability law by Congress allowed continued vaccine availability in the US.

If the verdict stands, each plaintiff will receive many 10's of millions, and a few lawyers will become fabulously wealthy.  Ask yourselves, which would you rather have: wealtthy lawyers, or a vaccine against corona virus?

The US badly needs tort reform at the Federal level.

2020-06-23 22:09,Deaths are way down.
2020-06-23 22:45,"From what I understand from the President, if we simply suspend testing for the next several weeks the problem will go away."
2020-06-23 23:06,"The ""surge"" in cases corresponds very closely to the mass protesting that has occurred over the past few weeks. I find it very frustrating that this very significant factor has almost been ignored by those trying to explain the increase in cases, or, worse, has been denied.
Indeed, the cases of COVID 19 are definitely on the rise.
Yes, there have continued to be reopenings which undoubtedly have contributed to this. But, by far, the biggest societal change during the last several weeks has been sudden and massive protests of thousands upon thousands of people close together. During a pandemic, this is a opportunity begging for widespread infections.
Acknowledging this does not in any way diminish the validity of the protests. It simply recognizes that the virus doesn't know if we are at the beach, in a restaurant, or at a protest. It eagerly awaits us no matter where we are. And if we ignore the most basic of medical recommendations - social distancing -the virus will do what viruses do and pounce right on us.
If we are to prevent the virus from spreading, we much  regulate our behavior in everything we do. If we chose to disregard recommendations, then we are also chosing to spread the virus.Large protests spread the virus. I offer no judgment here. It is our choice."
2020-06-23 23:00,"Fauci could have set his hair on fire and it would not have made any difference to the conservatives and Republicans.  They don't care about the unmatched professional expertise that he possesses that informs his opinions about the dangers of this pandemic.  They do not care about the lives of the public, not even their own voters.  

They care about maintaining political power for reasons other than the health and well-being of the public and they believe that ignoring the dangers of this pandemic will help them to do so.

The media is doing the public a great disservice by refusing to plainly state this reality."
2020-06-23 22:42,Thank GOODNESS for the GOOD DOCTORS as well as the rest of our Medical Community. They have the courage to ignore the clown at the top and keep doing and saying the right things. Bravo!
2020-06-23 22:40,"So Fauci thinks the next two weeks are critical, huh?  

Despite a tremendous effort on the part of many, the outright sabotage of their efforts by others, notably Trump and Pence, may end up dooming us in the U.S. against making any real progress at all against the pandemic."
2020-06-23 22:46,"I am fortunate to have traveled around the world.
Prior to the Trump presidency, I was proud to be a citizen of the United States.  In fact upon arriving back into our country, if the immigration officer did not say it, as my passport was being stamped for re-entry, I would ask, “aren’t you going to say welcome home.”
Since 2016 , I have not felt that pride. In fact, when traveling, I have often had to apologize for my country.
I commend the EU for safeguarding the health of their citizens, by banning travelers from the US. 
Trump is not the only one who can “dis” other countries.
It seems this is a stinging rebuke to his management of the Covid crisis in our country.
Another self pity grievance with which he can gin up his “base”"
2020-06-23 22:56,"It’s too late now. Due to the immaturity of our President & a ‘for profit’ healthcare system, COVID-19 has been allowed to engulf America. We are an embarrassment to the world with the most cases & deaths by far. Had the administration acted immediately, we could have saved many more lives and the economy. But Mr Trump and his cronies offered only a false choice: the economy or public health. The irony is that had we taken care of public health, the economy would have followed. Now we have 50 different public health policies for one nation. It really is beyond comprehension how our government allowed this to happen."
2020-06-23 22:44,"So many anti-mask people who “don’t believe in the virus”, or don’t believe it can affect them claim to “think for themselves”.  They “don’t believe the lame-stream media” or the authorities such as professional epidemiologists, because they supposedly think for themselves.  But instead of thinking for themselves they just believe whatever their alternative “authorities”tell them- even when what they say is contradicted by what they can see with their own eyes.  Its about being contrary, and very predictable.  Hardly original or independent."
2020-06-23 23:38,"So Americans were expected to take precautions to preserve their health and safeguard others.

2020-06-23 22:49,"As the virus becomes even more out of control in so many states, thanks in large part to the absence of any leadership from the White House, Trump is chiefly concerned that Dr. Fauci has an approval rating of 72% while his own is only 41%.  If Trump wants an approval rating like Dr. Fauci's, then I suggest he resign."
2020-06-23 22:36,"I am the polar opposite of an anti-vaxxer, but I will not take any vaccine approved or recommended by Mr. Trump's CDC, FDA, or HHS.

2020-06-23 22:49,Perhaps it would help if our ‘leaders’ went to visit a hospital I stead of standing around churches.
2020-06-23 23:14,"Trump is right to say he doesn't get the credit he deserves for his handling of the virus. He should have a favorable rating of 0%, not 41%, a number that reflects the willful and dangerous ignorance of his science and fact averse followers.

On the other hand, he is getting due credit from the rest of the world, since Americans will soon be barred from travel to most places in the world because of our disastrous response the the virus. MAGA, indeed."
2020-06-23 23:45,"Meanwhile, NY is re opening, finally.  It isn't over but not living in denial did flatten the curve."
2020-06-23 23:14,Trump thinks virus denial and an early reopening will help his prospects. The reverse is true. His followers think eschewing masks and clustering instead of distancing will help push to open the economy faster and preserve jobs. The reverse is true. Spreading kills jobs.
2020-06-23 23:23,"To Henry in NYC, about deaths being way down.  I would say, "" Not to those who have died""."
2020-06-23 23:54,"Back in late February/early March, I had already come to terms that Covid was going to be exponentially bad in the USA. I already accepted that I wasn't going to be seeing my colleagues, friends, family or do any recreational travel to America for the next few years. The fractured health care system there, income inequality, anti-government gun-loving folks, 50 states all their their own thing, zero safety net, a defensive mindset of ""my rights and my freedom"": the writing was already on the wall. Seeing any Washington, Oregon or California license plate here in Vancouver brings alarm. It is out of control down there, in more ways than one. Literally the USA can not collectively take care of it's people."
2020-06-23 23:39,"And in this administration who can Fauci count on to co-ordinate a program now that the Federal initiative has been destroyed by Trump so he can hold his childish rallies.  The States will have to do it as Trump left them to take charge.  Those like Texas and Florida led by ideologues who are not able to see beyond Republican politics will continue to endanger their populations.  But eventually even to those who go along with them, it will become clear that their beliefs are untenable and yes, dangerous.  Hopefully this will a turning point from childish leadership ala Trump to good old fashioned common sense.  It is worrisome though that within the Democratic Party there is a turn to a radical left, which will not solve our problems or make the Party stronger."

1) Stopping travel from china the day after the US. did.
2) Had excellent quarantine facilities.
3) Did extensive testing for the virus from earlier on.
4) Had adequate medical support for the seriously ill seniors.
5) The Australian government worked closely with several scientists around the country not just in their capital Canberra
6) Australia followed closely the treatment related research
7) Australian diet is balanced with optimal protein intake of poultry, eggs, fish and meat unlike Italy, Spain and France. 
8) Australians love the outdoors and the outback sporting activity and get plenty of fresh air and sunshine. 
9) They have not seen any new cases after opening.
10) Australian health care covers its entire population.

Gov. Abbott of Texas you have the finest medical schools and health care professionals in the USA. There is no excuse for this spread. I can tell you from my experience in Louisville, KY. Many people don't follow simple common sense CDC guidelines.

1) They don't wear proper masks properly.

Well, as Kris Kristofferson wrote, ""freedom is just another word for nothing left to lose."" It's pathetic, it's globally embarrassing, but these people will soon crawl back under their rocks to live their ignoble little lives.

Abbott contradicted the order saying that it was safe to open the state just to please POTUS. Well, as expected, three weeks later (incubation period included) the covid-19 cases are in the rise. First he blamed the “youth” for not following the guidelines, now he is allowing local mayors to place restrictions. Will they ever take responsibility for their bad decisions?

And if you do go out be sure to social distance and wear a mask - but you’re not required to wear one (can’t drink your martini otherwise).

I can only think of a person who won't wear a mask and bringing home the virus to a person who has health issues. I'd have to wonder if they couldn't override their ego for once to protect a loved one. But this is common throughout America. It starts with a president who, when presented with a mask says, No, thanks, it's not my style. In Nov we need to find a new style."

only supported the feeling of many that Trump was not serious when he said he begged his people to do less testing. However, I do think he was serious when he said more testing means more cases, which is obviously true but only half the story. As usual, the Resistance journalists always go too far in making Trump look bad. The sad thing is you only lose credibility with those of us who still seek honest reporting. And by the way, Trump is perfectly capable of making himself look bad all on his own,"

Congress does nothing to set guidelines for each state.  Governors do.  So why not have Fauci in a room with all 50 governors instead?  Because Congress loves to have televised hearings to play politics rather than do their jobs. 
And why are we asking a virologist about a vaccine?  Why not ask the scientists who actually make them?  Why do we ask Bill Gates about pandemics?

When you then add the rampant increase in the virus in deep red states like Arizona, Florida, and Texas whose compliant Republican governors emulate Trump and refuse to mandate business, church and public gathering closures and the mandatory wearing of face masks, you have a recipe for catastrophe.

So, Abbott decided not to call the fire department until there was a 4 alarm fire that was trapping his family in an upstairs bedroom.

The number of cases in Wayne County, MI and Miami-Dade County, FL is approximately the same.  Miami-Dade has maybe 3000 more.

I am confused why concern for Covid would prompt people to shift the debate to a seemingly far more active hot spot.

Only three other counties in the entire nation seem to be a more active hot spot over the last two weeks than Miami-Dade: Harris, Texas; Maricopa, Arizona; and Los Angeles, California."

Listening to the radio, even in NYC where most people understand the severity of the crisis, there are still radio hosts and callers doubting one aspect or another of the pandemic, even with all the facts staring at them, eager to accept misinformation at face value because it allows them to pretend everything is ok, that their faith in Trump was justified, just as Trump tries to remain in denial.

He said it wasn't Fox lying, it was all those other stations that were lying.  I said, you mean PBS, NBC, CBS, ABC—all of them are lying about the pandemic?  He said yes.  He doesn't wear a mask and will never wear one.

""Texas, our Texas, all hail the mighty state""?  He'd better do it while he still can."
2020-06-24 0:20,"As much as I want to travel to Europe (we go every summer), I want the EU to ban US travelers. Maybe THAT will send a signal to the leaders of this country that US is doing a TERRIBLE job and the rest of the world wants us to stay away. Blow to the ego of an egomaniac may do some good... I don't know. 

I'm desperate and want something - anything! - to help them realize this virus isn't going to wishfully disappear one day. I'm so embarrassed for our country and desperate for actual leadership that can understand science and sensibly guide people out of this mess.

The fact that we have politicized a pandemic and people can't seem to keep a mask on in public is beyond sad and discouraging."

Yet car crashes and seasonal flu are considered acceptable risks.

What's the difference?

Is the difference quantitative, as some have suggested? Is the virus different only because MORE people will get sick or die than will get sick or die from car crashes or the seasonal flu? Is that really the only difference?"
2020-06-24 3:56,"Should the EU distinguish among US states?

""As an American who has traveled around the world, I would welcome the EU ban on travelers from the US.""

I too have traveled around the world, very extensively. It may not be practical, but should the EU distinguish between US passengers arriving from, say, Wyoming, and US passengers arriving from, say, Washington, D.C.? Should Wyoming-based Americans be allowed to travel through Europe while D.C.-based Americans are not? Residents of those two areas are not treated the same in this country (Wyoming has had far few cases and deaths than D.C.). Should they be treated differently by the EU too?"
2020-06-24 4:02,"Gov. Abbott of Texas says that the safest place for Texans to be is home. He said “stay home.” Yet the State of Texas is one of those Republican states that has closed a record number of polling places in high density districts and won’t allow mail-in voting. If the governor is serious about stopping the spread of Covid-19, both now and in the coming months, then he should order all Texans to wear face masks, he should extend unemployment benefits, and he should send every Texan a voter registration form (now) and a mail-in and/or drop-off ballot in November."

Frankly, I don't see that here in SF. Many people don't wear masks outside (I do.), and many of those non-wearers are as Blue as they come.

I would draw a distinction, but not on ""political"" grounds. I would draw it on gender grounds. Here in SF, at least, women are more likely than men to be very strong advocates of mask-wearing and social distancing. Maybe women are more sensible than men; maybe not. However one answers that question, though, the distinction holds."

""But for someone living on the street, where should they hide to shoot up?  Maybe crouch down between a couple dumpsters?""

For those of us who believe drugs shouldn't be outlawed in the first place, the answer clearly is ""No, SF shouldn't bother."" Homeless people in SF often are drug addicts, and this may well bother many people. Not me. Nor do I think that cracking down will make a dime's worth of difference. I recall well my ""druggie days,"" and I don't recall at all that a fear of getting caught, or a fear of others noticing, was ever a significant motivator for me in any drug purchase or drug use. It shouldn't be either for SF homeless people. 

Frankly, I would much prefer that SF's stretched-thin police force be available to respond to a call that someone has broken into my home in the middle of the night than that that stretched-thin police force instead be occupied arresting some homeless person for shooting up in the Tenderloin."

Wrong.
The First Amendment grants you the right to speak without regard to the content of what you say.
It does not allow you to do so in a manner which endangers others -- e.g. by spreading the virus by exhaling it when you speak in close proximity to others.

American are dying or becoming seriously ill by the hundreds of thousands by direction or the lack thereof by men and women elected to public office without the knowledge means or commitment to combat that enemy, while taunting those who disagree with them.  

There are people dying by reason of the politics of their governors, or the geography of their residence; there are people dying because there is a perceived difference between science and religion, or whether they are liberal or conservative.  There are people flaunting laws, regulations, even suggestions of protecting themselves much less other with whom they may contact.  

There are those who decry safety and life deferring to money.  
Flaunting and taunting have become the new cheers of some.

I heard Asa Hutchinson today, still spouting the party line and treating Covid-19 the way conservatives have treated climate change, ""Well, different epidemiologists have different opinions..."" etc. and insisting that there was plenty of testing, and that their skyrocketing numbers were because of increased testing, not community spread. Uh, huh. 

Then he started muttering about how they had all these counties that ""only"" had twenty cases, or twenty fatalities... But when you have 75 counties, it adds up.

Seems like these Republican governors should stop trying to provide politcal cover for Donald Trump, and start insisting that the White House get their act together.  Lives are at stake."

I’m 73 years old, I’ve never gone out unless I felt I needed to go out."

Trump said, “ we have fifteen cases and soon they will be down to zero.” That was four months ago, and now we have more than two million cases.

Hopefully, we will realize we can not continue to ignore issues and bury our head in the sand. We need not only to squash the coronavirus, but to address climate change, and establish reasonable regulations related to the health and safety of our general population. 

The rich may have self interest and short term profits as sole goals but we need  a government that is concerned for the average person and the long term outlook of our nation."

For a little while the violent directed towards authority figures requiring masks seemed to scare officials off from doing the right thing. I can understand the fear when you're dealing with right wing extremists (who have always, always been a huge threat in the United States), but we've got to get more people masked to actually make a difference. It doesn't matter if most people wear masks if some people consistently go around not wearing them. The ones not wearing the masks are the ones taking more risks and those risks pile up everyday and threaten everyone else. Thank goodness Republican governors are finally starting to get it. Now that they're breaking away from Trump's poor leadership example, Trump may have less influence on the public as well."

To this day he has not appropriately advocated for more testing. Something, every other successful country has implemented. Trump, has openly said, he wants less testing. Has there been any pushback from Fauci concerning that?

No wonder right wingers love this ideology so much.  It's positively euphoric and intoxicating, makes me feel like a God.

Masks are essential... when we are breathing each others' air in indoor spaces. The science is clear on this. Outside, there is no need unless you're in a truly packed crowd where the natural movement of air is stilled by many bodies (raising a question: why in heck are you there?). Saying we need masks in every situation is factually wrong, and hurts the cause. 
These pictures of lightly attended beaches and parks don't help either - this is not where people are getting infected. Some of the pics look ""packed"" on first sight but, study a bit, and you see there is plenty of space and often a big ol' wind blowing.

Folks who argue we can't stay shut down or shut down again, I basically agree. But, we absolutely cannot re-open like this.

Many super-spreader events were caused by asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic individuals infecting dozens of people through normal exhalation, especially through singing, shouting, and laughing in an enclosed space, that turned their communities into viral hotspots. Masks, physical distancing, and reducing capacity of a room provide only partial protection.
The enormous political pressure to reopen the economy and confusion on aerosolized covid 19 forces Americans to make impossible choices, risking themselves and their families to make a living or have a normal cultural life. By winter, every neighborhood and medium to large work and meeting place in America will be touched by infection and death, and people who thought they were safe will feel betrayed.

2020-06-23 11:46,"There is a major error in this article. The fact that SARS-2 is spreading in clusters and not homogenous is very good news and doesn't make it harder to control, but easier. A virus with a homogenous R0 between 2-4 on average cannot be controlled without a vaccine or permanent lockdown. Look at Japan or SK, there has never been a lockdown, nor was it necessary. SARS-1's transmission characteristics was more like: out of 10 people 9 don't spread it and one spreads it to 20 people. It's not like this with SARS-2, but similar, with about 80% of infections being caused by 20% of patients. Now, these only happen in super-spreading events. If you control these through testing, tracing, masks, distance etc. you can cut of a HUGE part of thetransmission activity, lowering R0 to 1 or below. That's what SK and Japan been doing, Europe is doing now and it is working. But then again, in the US you neither have masks, a mostly ignorant population and of course, no tracing. So ... yeah."

If people are so fatigued with staying home briefly that they now need to run hog wild everywhere now I don’t know what’s to become of us. A lot of these states don’t require masks either and few are wearing them, especially the young. You would think we’d be having some sort of national reckoning. Why is it that we have the most cases and deaths in the world? Why do we continue opening totally unnecessary venues despite this and why are we unwilling to do the simplest things to try and stop the virus like staying apart and wearing masks? We will never get a handle on the virus until people in this country develop some self discipline, social conscience, and fortitude.

Sadly 120,000+ have already paid the ultimate price for that folly,  with many more to follow.  More Americans that died in WW1, twice as many who perished in Vietnam, and nearly 10% of Americans who have died in all wars.

The bars in my neighborhood that are doing outdoor dining are packed with people on the weekends, and again, no masks in sight.

Yes, maybe in places where protocols mean something and are rigorously followed (along with other strict protocols); e.g., hospitals.  

I wonder what it is going to take before we collectively agree that money can be recovered, lives not at all.  Will a million deaths do it?  How about five million?

I often wonder since so many are willing to do the virus's bidding are we simply zombie hosts where the virus directs its victim to come into contact with well people to spread the virus further? Coming into contact with other infected people does it no good. Why should we be any different than the other animals that viruses and fungi invade and control to their reproductive ends?"

Governors Murphy and Wolfe actually marched without masks

They led by example that it’s ok to defy their own orders.  Which show their orders are nonsensical."
2020-06-23 11:01,"Wisconsin’s Governor Evers wanted the state to remain restricted or closed a bit longer.  The selfish Wisconsin Supreme Court, the same one that forced an election in the middle of a global pandemic, would not allow further days of safety, and allowed reopening.

That same day Wisconsin bars were packed and Memorial Day weekend the bars were booming - never mind what might be dragged out of the bars to infect innocent people unsuspecting.  

But you know, anything for a drink in Wisconsin.  

Wearing masks here is scoffed at too, by many.  Yes, those might just be the same hecklers falling off the barstools."
2020-06-23 11:15,"In mid-March Dr. Birx (on the Covid task force) said that our success with containing and controlling the pandemic in the US would depend upon the millennials — “they are the core group that will stop this virus."" Very prescient. 
Well, we’re now seeing millennials’ character on display and it sorrowful to see. 20% of global incidence is now America’s distinction. 
I asked a shop keeper just yesterday (who was wearing a mask) how many patrons were wearing masks. His response? “Most everyone, but not the young people. They don’t care.”
I don’t know what to think. Is it just blind selfishness, indifference for the welfare of others? Perhaps ignorance? Willful disregard for guidance from experts? Or maybe just a toxic sociocultural mix resulting from a coddled, over-watched upbringing? 
Personally, I believe countries that appear to be getting a grip on the pandemic benefit from a more socially aware, less selfish younger population. Angering ill not just for our success overcoming the pandemic, but also for repairing the damage to our democracy from Trump and his ilk."

2020-06-23 10:56,"I received this email comment from a friend who lives in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. People outside the U.S. are concerned about the damage that Trump is doing to the United States. [Trump: “When you test, you have a case. When you test, you find something is wrong with people. If we didn’t do any testing, we would have very few cases.”] Therefore, ""less testing"" should solve all our problems.

""Hope you are keeping safe and well. Yes we are living in very interesting times so to speak. What's going on in the U.S. is making the rest of us quite worried. However with any luck the real nut bars will catch covid. Maybe even the great Cheato who is not really doing a great job of representing the US? I wonder how that would play out? 
Keep well and enjoy the summer as much as you can.""

2020-06-23 11:34,"Is this a man problem?

It’s not just Trump and his white male appointees who refuse to wear masks. It’s police. It’s evangelical pastors. 

And it’s well documented that men wash their hands less than women.

Personally, I think wearing masks and washing hands projects strength, intelligence and empathy."

2020-06-23 12:53,"The false equivalency drawn between protests and churchgoing sounds like an argument from a 4 year old. 

There are a few key differences between church services and protests, and these differences matter when it comes to disease transmission:

Church services are held indoors, with people in age groups that skew older, and few people wear masks. 

Protests are held outside, with people in age groups skewing younger, and where most protesters do wear masks.

Simple science even a 4 year old could understand."
2020-06-23 12:56,"I work as a dealer in Nevada. At my casino, we dealers have no plexiglass, we don't have our temperatures checked, we weren't tested for the virus. Some dealers opt to wear face shields, but the way they wear them almost as visors and without a mask, I am just waiting for them to become vectors.

If you want to stay safe, don't play at the tables. We aren't enforced to clean the tables, and chips and monies are NEVER cleaned. The machines don't get disinfection treatment after each player, so stay off those too.

New rule: Wear a mask at table games - what a farce, people take them off to drink, talk, and smoke. 

A few casinos appear to keep you safe, but if the chips, money, and machines aren't cleaned constantly, you risk your life for ""entertainment"". Play online casinos/slots and socialize with select friends instead."
2020-06-23 13:00,"It’s really pretty simple. Social mingling and interaction quickly bring about large scale spread of a new virus that, seemingly randomly, has little effect on, mildly sickens, hospitalizes or kills its victims. Staying home and/or social distancing and masking prevent or highly restrict spread of the virus. Until there is an effective vaccine and/or treatment, they are the only things that do. Most people still want to practice these proven, common sense measures. A large handful of a mix of the unemployed and some restive crybabies who can’t take the isolation wants, loudly and even violently, to defy the virus and bring back pre-viral behaviors. The complication is the varying degrees of financial strain put on individuals, towns, cities, businesses, states and the country by huge numbers of workers staying home. What makes the whole witches brew unmanageable is that there is no common sense national standard for what to “open up”, when and how. National leaders just want to open the whole country back up and have everyone grit their teeth until their family members stop dying. Some civic leaders want to - imagine this nonsense - make the degree of opening up dependent on the level of new cases of the virus leveling off or sinking. ALL of the national and many of the state level leadership are immature, greedy, scared children who are incapable of managing and just want to retain power. Some of their constituents just want life as it used to be. The rest is us. Simple!"
2020-06-23 13:03,"What did people expect when they didn't want to wear masks, didn't want to stay home, didn't want to give others a break either?  You'd think that for some of the more affluent, who depend upon the less well paid members of society to support them while they stay home, would be more understanding.  Apparently not.  

It's more important to assert one's freedom by not wearing a mask while on line to get into a store, or while biking on local bike paths, or walking through the crowded town plaza.  All this is doing is extending the run of the virus in America.  We can't keep everything locked down for the rest of the year but if people continue to flout the rules it will be.

There are times when what's good for the group is beneficial for the individual as well.  This is one of those times and if Americans and their leaders cannot recognize it, they deserve whatever they get.  If we want a healthy and prosperous society, what Trump and his colleagues are doing is not what we should be doing.  We don't have access to medical care when and where we need it.  We are not millionaires.  

Wear your masks! Wash your hands.  Limit your social contacts."
2020-06-23 12:50,"I went to see a doctor yesterday.  An osteopath for pain management.  Was told 1 patient at a time in office and we'll be wearing masks.  I wore mine, but when I got there, the doctor wasn't wearing one.  I asked and his response was that he would ""not buy into the fear mongering"".  I decided to go ahead with the appointment as I've been in pain for quite some time.  He did put on a surgical mask during 1 point when I was lying face up on the table and he was standing behind my head working on my neck.  

The entire appointment was about 20 minutes.

I'm a little annoyed about this incident.  Shouldn't a health professional wear a mask at an appointment?  Should he have put one on when I asked if he would be wearing one and that I was concerned about bringing home the virus to my young daughter?  And isn't his claim of ""fear mongering"" belligerent? 

I'm curious what people think of this situation.  To me, if we can't get health professionals to comply with rules, we're doomed for sure."
2020-06-23 13:03,"Just as predicted by public health experts.

Did people really buy into the Trump happy talks about the virus disappearing with the warm weather?  Do people under 50 really think that they can party on without spreading the virus?

Americans can do 4 things to prevent the contagion: wear masks, wash your hands, social distance and vote for a President who is more concerned about the public health than the Dow Jones.

To those who want to see the economy revive, start doing your part.  “Quarantine fatigue” is a pathetic excuse."

I will not be preached to by anyone who cannot cite her advocacy for treating SJWs and rioters the same way she proposes to treat diners."
2020-06-23 13:05,"This isn't a surprising result. And it is perhaps human nature as much as nutty GOP politics. A lot of people view Covid like a hurricane, a finite event.  It hits you or not.  Once it passes, the sun is out and you are safe.  So the lockdown lift became the all-clear signal to go out and play.

For the more cautious, a better ""looks like"" for Covid risk is a hired assassin. Specifically, the one from the 80's who taunted his police pursuers with the gibe: ""You have to be lucky every time. I only have to be lucky once."" 

As any mystery reader knows,  always look over your shoulder and avoid dark alley ways. No matter what others do. 

Just my opinion."
2020-06-23 13:08,"I blame Trump for the recent uptick in virus cases. He has tried very hard to convince the American public that the virus was no longer a threat. This, of course, is totally false. It appears that Trump hopes to ""wish away"" the virus that has killed so many thousands of Americans. 

What is so sinister about this is that Trump's pronouncements about the virus no longer being a threat is a deliberate lie that he is spreading in order to convince as many people as he can that they can now move on to other concerns and increase his chances of winning a 2nd term in office. 

This lie by Trump is so inherently sinister in my opinion as to be more than sufficient grounds for immediate impeachment and removal from office. 

Thousands of Innocent people who were foolish enough to believe the ""Liar-in-Chief"" have lost their lives because they believed that it was now safe to drop their guard -- i.e. no more masks, sheltering-in-place, and no more social distancing.

Trump's term as President will go down in U.S. history as among the absolute worst given his complete disregard for the health and wellbeing of American citizens. His selfish political concerns were more important to him than the lives of gullible Americans who made the mistake of believing the ""Liar-in-Chief"", Donald J. Trump."
2020-06-23 13:06,"The problem is not that Trump rushed and pressured states to reopen their economies to soon ignoring medical experts.  No, the problem is the news media is not staying on message.  Trump is likely meeting with Barr to concoct some emergency to get a federal court to issue an injunction to stop  the news media from reporting any more information on the coronavirus  until Nov 4."
2020-06-23 13:11,"Opening up the economy without getting the population on board protecting each other (thanks Trump! The rest of us don't get tested everyday and surround ourselves people who are also tested everyday) is a formula for disease and death. What did we expect, really?"
2020-06-23 13:25,"What we are seeing is a conversion to the Swedish response to the pandemic. The new cases, reflecting both increased testing and new infections among the young whose prognosis is excellent when infected. The march toward re-opening is almost certainly irreversible. The number of deaths has continued its decline so far and I suspect the number of deaths will perhaps increase at a much slower rate since the young are protected. Those of us that are the vulnerable ones will be prudent, in the main, when we can. The promised vaccine may not be more effective than the flu vaccine (30-50% for old people). No matter who is elected we are in for it for a long time. It's real easy to play the blame game. There are so many to blame and so few who are blameless."
2020-06-23 13:27,"There is clear evidence that the virus can remain suspended in aerosols and active for hours in indoor spaces. 
Establishments will only respond if customers refuse to enter unless masks are required of all who enter and refuse to serve those who do not comply. 

“No shoes, no shirts, no service” practices have been commonplace on at establishments along our shores for as long as I can remember. (I’m in my 70’s.). Upscale restaurants even require dress coats! Surely requiring masks is the simplest solution."
2020-06-23 13:30,Our profoundly immoral Trump owns these new infections and deaths also.  He demanded his belligerent supporters to cry and demand to be open so here we are now.  More bad news.  At least the Dems leaders listen to the scientists and data and look at NY they were getting better but now will be opening more offices and that will not be good.  We need to wait for a vaccine to save our American humanity .  Republicans should not even be elected as a dog catcher any where.

Any plans to test and trace, or monitor for at least 14 days? Any city with an international airport should take head. This virus can be imported from anywhere (not just China); it takes only one person to infect many, and we are unprepared. What measures will be taken by this Administration?"
2020-06-23 13:52,"Yet another article stating the obvious and another comment chain of complainers.  Let's just get real here.  Corona virus is a natural occurrence.  It is not a terrorist attack, war, mass shooting.  It is part of the earth-spinning-on-axis, tides-rise-and-fall, rain-falls-from sky part of life.  It has a high fatality rate and severity for those at risk (>65 with chronic health conditions, <65 with chronic health conditions, over 80).  As a society, we have come to believe that medical procedures will miraculously take care of everything for us.  Bummer is that we have out of ignorance, hope, politeness, laziness, or some combination thereof come to pretend that being overweight, Type 2 diabetic/pre-diabetic, hypertensive is ""healthy"" as long we are ""trying"" or that it is ""well-managed"".  The corona virus is proving that is naive thinking.  Without a vaccine or 100% lock down, it will continue to infect people.  Society has two responsibilities:  1) ensure there is enough hospital capacity and PPE for health professionals.  Then, it is between you, the doctor, and God to sort things out 2) Wear masks and distance to the extent possible.  Could a lot of Americans die?  Yes - a rough, worst-case yard stick is about 2.3 million (70% of population infected with average infection fatality rate of 1%).  Absent a vaccine, that is how nature works.  We can't destroy the economy and educational systems for the remainder.  Society owes a bed, a mask, and some courtesy."
2020-06-23 13:21,"The behavior of citizens who totally disregard facts and those who threaten public health officials who are trying desperately to save lives is definitely not that of the greatest generation. Given the hardships endured daily by millions all over the world, given the suffering so many go through in world wars and epidemics and civil wars, it is despicable how so many Americans just have to have a haircut or go to a bar because they just can't stand restrictions. Really pitiful and very dangerous. Shameful is a polite description. Grow up and face the music."

In initially, there were people who weren't following the mask policy. I would confront them and follow them calling them arrogant and selfish and would then call the police if they didn't leave via SHAME. People saw me doing this and thanked me for standing up...older people, people with families. I'm not a big guy, but sometimes you have to do the right thing. Combine that with Cuomo ensuring that all of NY knew this was a huge problem... Now our numbers are coming down...NY now gets it."
2020-06-23 13:17,"Once the White House decided that the threat of Covid-19 was a political football, and the official position of his supporters was going to be that it was all a hoax, we were all doomed.

And the tragedy is that preventing this entirely was possible, reducing the impact was possible, and the presidents' mismanagement was so egregious that it created the impression that he *wants* millions of Americans to die from it just because he said stuff.

And the presidents' choices also led to terrorist threats against the people that were trying to prevent the worst, such as Ohio director of public health Dr Amy Acton. As in, there were armed men camped outside her house demanding her resignation, with more than a few hints that if she didn't she and her family would be killed, and the police did nothing to protect her."
2020-06-23 13:21,"Although I am an atheist, I can certainly understand the distress religious people feel by not going to church.  What I can not understand is church goers not using masks or not attempting social distancing . The central tenet of Jesus’s message is love, as in love thy neighbor. What I see is selfishness, and unfortunately, making a political statement. I would have expected more caring for members of their own congregation and their neighbors in their town."
2020-06-23 13:41,The latest study from Penn State indicates that the virus is far more widespread and far less deadly than we originally suspected - less deadly even than the flu.

The last three months has not been without value and benefit. We learned we could be patient, practice risk mitigation, and still function. Now, it's time to put that to work for another three month period."
2020-06-23 14:09,"It's very apparent to me that churches are a prime place for virus transmission. Not only do services take place indoors but there's typically a lot of singing, which produces droplets that carry the virus. Thankfully, my church recognizes this and has taken services on-line. We call each other and have Zoom meetings. Younger people, wearing masks, maintain the grounds as needed and deliver groceries to those who cannot go out at all. But the building itself remains closed, and, sad as it is, we understand and accept that it will be a long time before we can gather in person again."

What does it say when you refuse to wear a mask because it is your “liberty” to spread the virus to others who may get very sick or even die?  

And to those who say, “but we need to open the economy,” we could have done that with a true leader who cared more about his country than in his need for a “magic” belief that it would just go away and be to “zero” in short order. A short, strict lockdown, coupled with mass testing and contact tracing would have saved many lives and the long-term health of others, and allowed us to more safely and more effectively re-open our economy .

""Confirmed cases"" is a poor metric. One reason is that depends on the intensity of surveillance.  If folks go looking for CV with their CV Geiger counters, they find it.  No surprise.

A bigger question is: How has CV been dispersed in the population with anyone knowing?  It would be nice to get more reporting about data on serological (antibody) testing.

Meanwhile, CV has yet to peak in Mexico and appears to have peaked in Brazil and Russia.  It's not obvious whether or not CV will soon peak in India."

At the beginning of June, the Times published a series of editorials with titles like ""Protest is Patriotic,"" along with many op-ed columns, encouraging mass public demonstrations, with no mention of wearing masks, and little or no consideration of the ongoing pandemic.

The motivations for the protests was understandable, the trigger was the murder of George Floyd.  In normal times, the editorials would have been reasonable.

But these are not normal times, and in the age of corona virus, these editorials represented irresponsible journalism.

They helped propagate a cavalier disregard for the pandemic.  After all, mass protests, which by their nature preclude social distancing, and which involve shouting and loud voices, are an effective means of spreading respiratory viruses; contact tracing after a protest is impossible.

It is the attitude propagated by the Times' editorials, and similar pieces that appeared in other progressive main stream media, that contributed to the cavalier attitude towards the pandemic we see described in this article.

There is something to be said for rationally and intelligently lifting sanctions in spite of the increasing case rates, but at the same time mass protests and large scale social gatherings without masks are probably a mistake, and the Times made a serious and consequential error in judgement in encouraging them."
2020-06-23 14:08,"We are a nation of stupid, reckless, thoughtless, and impatient people.  Why is it so hard to connect the dots between exposure and getting sick, especially from crowded places?

I disagree. This is all predictable. The one common factor for bar, strip club, churches and Trump's rally in Tulsa OK is "" Crowd "". This is what the public health officials and Infectious Disease expert like Dr. Fauci explained exactly how the respiratory virus spreads. The more the people, the bigger the crowd, the more efficient is for the transmission of the virus in particular without facial mask. We are still in the first wave and with no peak in sight."
2020-06-23 14:34,"Bars and restaurants are the new vectors and 20 somethings are the new spreaders.  But there are plenty of pro Trump codgers that won't wear a mask either.  And a lot of masked are not covering their nose so it is pretty pointless, even employees who are required to wear masks at work are pulling them below nose, under chin, etc.  So it is still just one big petri dish out there folks."

2020-06-23 14:49,"This was completely predictable. With an immunologically naive population and no vaccine, it has been clear that people gathering in significant numbers in close proximity would continue to spread SARS-2 (COVID-19). This is how respiratory viruses spread in a susceptible population: no mystery here."
2020-06-23 14:40,"Clearly the refusal of many to wear a mask is not working and meeting in large numbers in close quarters is playing Russian roulette with lives. There needs to be a national law. If you leave home you wear a mask, no mask no entry to a building and a fine of $1,000. This would also apply to trump and crew."
2020-06-23 14:35,"It is no surprise the numbers rise sharply in US states where precautions are ignored or downright ridiculed. The first wave is merely hitting many US states now. Once it really hits the rural US it will be very hard to control.

The virus is not spreading that fast and was severely hampered by lock-down measures in many states, despite the disastrous and inadequate federal response from the Trump regime and his associated propaganda media.

Many US states haven't seen the spike yet, and likely wont for several months. Likely only a few percent of the US population have met the virus yet.

We have no vaccine and the first small tests for antibodies are not promising for the herd immunity fantasies. We do not even know if a lasting vaccine is possible. And we do not fully understand the damages done.

The way to beat the virus is to starve it of new victims, with containment, isolation and quarantines. But with many states worldwide failing such measures that game is likely lost for a very long time to come. 

What's left is to learn to live with virus, and it will render many businesses obsolete, especially in the hospitality sector, entertainment and the large US ""religious"" belief industries.

The virus has the power to alter our way of life and work, and most probably will for many years to come. No amount of Trump blaming and sulking can change that now."

DJT is not the problem.  He is a creation of the problem - stupid Americans addicted to the boob tube.  Over-entertained Americans together with a national religion that can't stand the test of modern ethics is the foundation of the spiritual waste-land that America has become."

How ridiculous! And now here we are."
2020-06-23 14:14,Somethings you failed to headline in your piece. Could the cases be an outcome of large protests and riots that occurred about two weeks ago. Are these large outbreaks in some communities associated with illegals who are afraid to be identified and share their contacts?
2020-06-23 14:43,"Bars, Churches and strip clubs, what do they all have in common? They attract fanatical tRumpers and the seedy-side-of-lifers. It seems these folks are willing to take the risks of getting COVID-19 and dying to get their jollies. Unfortunately, once infected, they then move on to infect innocent people that just want to survive the pandemic. It amazes me that people wear seat belts, shoes and shirts, and other PPE without question but have an issue with wearing a mask that has been proven to save lives."
2020-06-23 14:54,"Florida's Gov. DeSantis recently decreed the fate of the elders. ""When you have a virus that disproportionately impacts one segment of society,"" for the good of the ""working age people"" he will not consider restrictions as the curve rises.  Said he, ""the negative effects"" of shutting down again would be much worse than ""any gains you're getting.""  No order to wear masks, no reductions in crowding, no enforcement.

""It's the economy, stupid!""

DeSantis did not have the courage to name the affected group.  He is afraid to say it:  the old and infirm.  In the struggle between the lives of the elders and the life of the economy, he chooses the economy.  And so do ""working age"" folks, the young, the healthy, the members of the Me Generation.

DeSantis was clear - the elders are expendable, or as the Nazi said, ""useless eaters.""  And the Me Generation agrees.

We elders are not the only expendables.  People of color, the poor, the young but infirm, all are being thrown to the wolves of Wall Street in the face of the power of the economy.

We have little power, and must suffer those who do, however Draconian.  We want the best for youth, and so we go gentle into that good night, not raging, raging, against the dying of the light.  Dylan Thomas would have old age burn and rave at close of day, but DeSantis would have us toddle off to the mortuary, placid in our sacrifice.

DeSantis is not alone - other states have so decreed.  Thanks, Governors, for your leadership."
2020-06-23 14:52,"And where is Trump going today?  A mega church but they claim they are killing the virus.  Churches are notorious incubators for contagion.  People hugging, shaking hands, passing the basket, holy water fonts, singing, and communion in all its forms.  Then you have the greeting time with coffee, donuts, and maybe brunch.  A few years back the Catholic church I attended wised up and stopped the ""handshake of peace"" during cold and flu season."
2020-06-23 14:55,"So the Seattle region (a 'blue' area, generally) went through the COVID spread, had to clamp down, social distance hardcore, wear masks, etc. and got things generally under control. But the rest of Washington State (like Yakima County, a very 'red' area, by the way) got to do what they wanted and now they have a case explosion. And the solution is ship the people to Seattle to cause that region - the one who did everything right - to suffer more? Maybe it doesn't get into the community there again, but the doctors and nurses surely have suffered enough and could use a break for sure.

What sick real-life version of the prodigal son is this?!?

Na, sorry. You people in rural areas learn, do the right thing, and participate in the mask wearing and social distance thing, or you can suffer in your rural hospitals with 3 ICU beds.

The blue areas should be more than sick of constantly prescribing a better path forward, being ignored, then having to 'save' the red areas yet again when they willfully ignored (and sometimes laughed at) the advice given."

2020-06-23 15:07,"I loathe Trump and his minions, but I wish the Times would explain why cases are surging and number of daily deaths is falling (32%) in today's Times.  Is it because of New York's great success that the national numbers appear this way - i.e., take New York out of the equation and deaths are rising?  is it because many older and vulnerable populations are better protected while younger people are the majority of new cases? Do epidemiologists expect the falling death rate to boomerang upwards?  I'd like to see a little more empiricism in this regard.  And thanks to anyone who can provide links to credible, professional sources that can explain the falling death rates."
2020-06-23 14:53,"Let the fearmongering continue.  There is a solution; if you are in fear of contracting COVID or any other virus, stay completely isolated. Have those at high risk remain as isolated possible.  Healthy people, aside from extremely rare cases, recover from this virus just fine, many without even realizing they ever had it. On the other hand, unhealthy people get sick and die, elderly people, reach the end of their life and get sick and die.  My 89-year-old father came down with the flu three years ago and died. It was heartbreaking, but it is part of life.  

If people want to stay isolated and/or secluded util there is a vaccine (which won't be proven to be effective for at least a year) let them stay home until then.  They are free to do that, but please do not tell me I have to do so.   

As an aside, for all those blaming this on Trump and republicans, don't you see the irony in that the counties suffering the most from the virus (not to mention civil unrest) are predominantly democratic hubs?"
2020-06-23 15:03,"It's June.  The temperature is high, the humidity is high, and the virus is still with us.

It did not ""magically disappear"" in April.

Heat and humidity do not seem to kill enough of it to protect us. 

The national numbers of daily infections exceeded 30,000 on Friday (June 19), Saturday and Monday.  On Fathers Day, Sunday June 21, only 26,000 infections were reported.  But if you look at the records, the reports EVERY Sunday are a bit lower, perhaps because some people are off work.

We have not seen those numbers since April to early May, when NY, NJ and MI were having serious problems. 

If the reported infections continue to increase, we are likely going to see a large wave of hospitaizations and death in a few weeks, somewhere around July 4th to 11th.  If that happens and there are no (or few) changes in ""directives"" from state and local governments, we will be in serious trouble.

2020-06-23 15:33,"This situation just reinforces the selfishness that has taken over.  
 The reason for one to wear a mask is to protect others and people don't want to be inconvenienced. They don't care about the effect that their decision has on others. It is all about the individual's happiness and comfort. 

That means the people who refuse to wear masks are the most protected because the responsible, considerate people wear masks to protect them."

Unable to put up with what is needed for our own and others well being, we cry and whine and use the excuse of freedom to do whatever we want instead of what is needed for the public good.
The problem is that we as a nation have not suffered personally in these present generations. Many of these jerks that refuse to follow guidelines have nice homes they can be quarantined in. We are extremely privileged and don’t realize it or appreciate it. We are spoiled. How hard is it to wear a mask? Such an imposition. People around the world, with much more difficult situations are doing better than we are. We are.not suffering nearly as much as most of the world other than what we now have imposed on ourselves by spreading the virus irresponsibly. 
And our leaders are encouraging this stupidity 
Thankfully we never had to live thru the blitz, the extreme poverty as there is in third world or developing countries, monsoons, extreme droughts leading to widespread starvation.
We have robust medical care. Perhaps to a degree, this gives people a false sense of security compared to places like in India, where people are being turned away at the door of hospital after hospital.

Some call it the adrenaline rush, basically tempting fate. People don't do well with anxiety and stress and seek to eliminate it through various means including drugs ,etc.  Those who believe they are low risk believe its better if they do contract the virus, gain immunity, and then they can go on with their lives. They tell themselves optimistically, that its like a bad case of the flu.  I know, its totally selfish but its reality.  This reality also means that the rest of us who have less favorable odds have to take care of ourselves and not unnecessarily put ourselves in harms way. Always remember the majority rules."

If you're so arrogant, selfish and stupid that you don't care if you're endangering the people around you, then do us all a favour and stay at home when you get sick.

You have to read all the way to paragraph 28 to even find the short 2 sentence paragraph that mentions the 10s of thousands of people who have filled the streets in protests over various grievances in the last month.  And most of those 2 sentences are spent convincing you these haven't played a role in the increases.  Agenda maybe?  So far the studies looking to determine the role of protests have been suspect.  One looking at Minnesota looked at tests of 3300 protesters finding a 1.4% positive rate and showing that was below the 3.7% positive rate of the other 17,000 tests run.  The problem is the protester's tests were run on random asymptomatic people whereas the majority of the 17000 were run in clinical situations on symptomatic people or people with known close exposures.  You would expect to get higher positive rates in the symptomatic group.  But the NYT will find and report whatever fits the narrative they want to report.

In supermarkets, some seniors appear oblivious to social distancing and one-way aisles but people give them wide berth.  Many stores require masks and shoppers just wear them without acting as if the stores are requiring patrons to forfeit a kidney to enter.

Coronavirus, masks, etc are not political here. In fact, the conservative provincial Premiers are generally supportive of the liberal federal government's policies and actions regarding Coronavirus.  Nursing homes have been hardest hit but the government is working hard to protect vulnerable seniors.  Canada is not perfect, and more testing is needed, but the politics are so much healthier.

Putting in a 2- or 3-week lag between case counts and death counts, the trend is still down and has been for a long while.

Fast track a couple of months. We are seeing a downward trend due to distancing, masks and quarantines. Our governors learned from Italy, Spain and China the trajectory of the virus and acted...some not as quickly as they should have but responsibly enough.

Meanwhile, we took a plane in February from Florida to fly home. No awareness of the virus there and beaches were filling with tourists, bars overflowed and the Governor was mute. It took a few months to reach many of these non-believing states but here we are.
 
No masks or quarantines for them, lip service paid to distancing measures. “ Freedom” and “Liberty, the disbelief that the numbers were real, a basic distrust of science and scientists, and ignorance ruled the day.

1. We have a president who is mentally and emotionally incompetent to deal with a crisis as serious as a pandemic.

2. We have a president whose only purpose and objective is to win re-election, and anything that deflects from that is denied and disregarded.

3. We have a president who is aided and abetted by a political party that aligns with the president on reasons 1 and 2 above, because it coincides with their own interest and agenda.

4. We have a president whose followers went into ecstasy at a rally when he proved to them that he is able to drink water from a glass with one hand.

5. We have a president whose name is Donald Trump.

There are other reasons you should feel free to add to this list."

Instead we were treated to a daily airing of grievances by the president with suggestions to take malaria drugs with no proven benefit, stick UV lights up our butts, or ingest caustic cleansers. Add to this toxic brew cosplay warriors with assault style weapons whining because they couldn't get a haircut or buy bird seed and we get what we have today: An entirely avoidable mess if only adults had been in charge."
2020-06-23 15:31,"Stupid is as stupid does: as in not wearing a mask to make some “statement”.  Masks save lives, people!  

Let’s go over this again:  Covid 19 not only kills.  It often causes long term health problems for many who have even moderate symptoms.  Younger patients might not die, but they are showing memory, cognitive and physical declines that last months or longer - it’s too soon to know how long these effects persist.

This virus spreads when tiny invisible droplets pass from an infected to a healthy person.  In most cases,  transfer happens when these persons are closer than @6 feet, and the infected party is speaking, laughing, singing, sneezing or coughing toward the healthy one. Being in enclosed spaces ups the risk.

People can carry the virus with no symptoms, and even testing negative is not a certain measure of safety.  Tests need to be taken and processed correctly.  A false negative often means the test was taken too early after exposure - at least 4 days from exposure is the latest advice.  If you don’t know you’ve been exposed, relying on a negative test to visit grandma has risks.  

But if the infected person wears a mask properly (covering nose and mouth), the transmission risk he or she poses to others drops significantly.  Wearing a mask is an act of kindness to others.  It is the ultimate act of doing to others what you’d have them do unto you.

Not wearing a mask is supremely selfish but above all stupid."

So....don’t congregate in large numbers-particularly indoors, don’t pack together too close and wear a mask.

2020-06-23 16:25,Masks should absolutely be required at religious services. Singing and projecting one's voice loudly is one of the best ways to spread the Covid-19 virus. It causes the release of aerosols that project for considerable distance and persist for many minutes.

2020-06-23 16:33,"Really no surprise.

 Opening up before an area has reached its peak & bent the curve down to near zero is a recipe for disaster.  NY State has successfully bent the curve because it did wait until attaining statistical benchmarks of success before it reopened. If other states follow New York's lead, they can achieve similar success.
 But most of the states in the South & West are now experiencing their surge, & it will be weeks before they hit their peak. Logically, those states should institute strict shelter in place orders for about 3 more months, along with universal mask wearing & conscientious social distancing. If they fail to do so, they will be in danger of overwhelming their hospital systems, running out of ventilators & PPE. The last thing those places should be doing is pushing for more re-opening.

 The inconvenient reality is that this highly contagious, lethal virus will continue to ravage any place where people fail to obey the instructions of medical experts. Following the lead of Trump & many GOP governors will only exacerbate the worst avoidable disaster in modern American history."

My large catch-all category--based as much upon my own anthropology as much as anything--is that people of Western culture like Americans suffer from egocentrism that allows us to think we're less vulnerable than others and to otherwise distort our worldview.  We don't choose our authorities well--many of us--and so we listen to ourselves, our group reps, or to people like our national disgrace of a president. We also justify materialistic pursuits as worthy of risk and allow self-manipulation to determine the right way--instead of listening to that internal voice that says ""maybe this isn't a good idea at all"".

With that many new daily infection no one should be surprised a new clusters. The US still can’t test more than 500,000 a day when Trump had claimed we would be able to test millions a day.

We need easier access to reliable testing.  And we need to get realistic about how life needs to be lived until there's a vaccine and/or treatment.

""I just wish they would not clog up the hospital system for everyone else ... ""

A PA Senator says hospital admissions are down, but I read elsewhere that they're up. Which is it?"
2020-06-24 2:07,"This is precisely why I haven't been tested, even though testing is free and readily available in SF:

""Don't they know that you can test negative one day then get the virus the next day.  What good does it do?""

Indeed, a testee may even have the virus but test negative for it. I'd like to think that ""tests"" are at least reliable when the testee tests positive, but I understand even that is not necessarily so. Reportedly, ""tests"" are inaccurate 30% of the time, which, in my thinking, means that tests are 100% unreliable."
2020-06-24 2:50,"This reader makes no sense at all:

""I hope New York will be the first to send needed ventilators and health care volunteers to Washington state..."" 

Some areas of New York will need ventilators for a long time going forward. If so, why in the world should those NY areas send ventilators to hospitals in Washington State, which may or may not need those ventilators?

West Coast states -- Washington, Oregon, California -- have long been sending ventilators to Eastern states that need them more. 

But why? 

Shouldn't this be done on a hospital-by-hospital basis? If a governor wants to take credit for decisions made by hospitals in his state, so be it, but that doesn't change the salient fact -- that ""allocation"" decisions are made, or at least should be made, on a hospital-by-hospital basis. If a hospital in NY needs more ventilators, it shouldn't be sending ventilators to hospitals in Washington State, or vice versa. The ""receiving"" hospital may or may not need those ventilators more than the ""sending"" hospital needs them, and the distinction between ""sending"" and ""receiving"" should not depend on the geographical location of the hospital."
2020-06-24 3:03,"As many other readers have pointed out, when I stay in my house or back yard, I don't either get or transmit the virus. But I also don't get hit by a car, or catch the seasonal flu, or make it more likely that someone else will. Yet car crashes and seasonal flu are considered acceptable risks. Someone argued that the virus is different because more people have died from it, but that strikes me as a quantitative difference at most. 

Since most ""high virus"" states are ""lockdown"" states, and most ""low virus"" states are not, are the governors of lockdown states misleading residents when they insist that those residents ""lock down?"" Should they be insisting instead that residents of their states behave like residents of ""non-lockdown"" states?"
2020-06-24 2:29,"All this talk about ""flattening the curve"" seems irrelevant to me. 

""Flattening the curve"" simply defines the rate at which ALL people eventually get the virus. It implies that everyone will eventually get the virus, but that it might take longer than anticipated -- i.e., that the ""curve"" might be flattened.

I'd like to think, instead, that I may never get the virus, and I think most people think that. That's not ""flattening the curve,"" though. It's denying that there IS a curve."
2020-06-24 1:46,"No need to wait for what this reader suggests:

""It is 100 percent drawn down Red vs Blue. Loyal Trumpers shout about liberty and their rights while the rest of us try to stay away from them and their germs.""

In SF, though masks have been required since late May, most people don't wear them outdoors (though 100% do wear masks in stores), presumably arguing, if challenged -- as never happens (this being SF, remember?) -- that they didn't expect to be close to other people when they went out and, therefore, didn't bother to put on a mask. Frankly, I don't see any ""Red v. Blue"" politics here -- someone who doesn't wear a mask is likely to be ""Blue"" on most matters."

Sorry, not enough. You can't just say people are asking for it and let churches continue to meet. Plenty of churches, synagogues, and mosques are doing virtual services, and while they don't like it, they know it's a sacrifice we have to make until a vaccine. This is not leadership. Maybe we need a cordon sanitaire around states like WV (and Texas, and Florida...)."
