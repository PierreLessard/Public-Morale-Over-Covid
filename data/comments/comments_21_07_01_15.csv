A major study shows that the longer people are on it, the less chance they have, and many will live less than a year and in a nursing home. It damages the blood and causes other problems. A friend of mine had a double heart valve replacement last month in Phoenix and had to be on ECMO for a week or a bit more. He had had a non-hospitalized case of COVID a a few months earlier, and the autopsy showed it had damaged his lungs so much that they couldn’t provide enough oxygen. His death saved him from a a life in a nursing home and an early death. He was 63."
2021-07-12 13:03,"The ones who could have gotten a shot but refused, should be sent home and told: you are right, Covid is a hoax, it is just the common cold, go home, rest in bed, and take some aspirin."
2021-07-12 13:06,Smokers should be bottom of the list.
2021-07-12 13:15,"At some point Health Insurance Companies are going to start refusing to cover people who refused vaccine and then needed millions in care because of that foolish decision. 

Just like your car insurance company would refuse to cover the damage to your car when you wrecked it street racing."
2021-07-12 13:07,"People who ignore the science, the preponderance of information, and refuse vaccination should go to the end of the line for treatment. Not only are they willfully risking their own lives, but they also increase the risk for doctors, nurses and anyone who comes into contact with them. It also means the nation's economy could go into a second tailspin costing millions their jobs.

Once upon a time there was an expression known as ""contributory negligence"". Those who refuse vaccines, social distancing and masks are criminals and should be treated as such.

I look forward to Trump's allocution where he admits in open court that he knew his bogus cures were nonsense and urges all of his followers to get vaccinated."
2021-07-12 12:56,"Sadly, how many of these patients using a treatment limited by supply did not get the vaccine or take any precautions?  

One other question, why isn't the miracle drug given to Trump more widely available?"
2021-07-12 13:07,"""...clinicians were left to apply differing criteria, with insurance coverage...""
It is our national shame that insurance coverage dictates what medical care a person can get."
2021-07-12 13:19,"We have the data that identifies COVID hotspots in America, concentrations of COVID breakout due to the failure to get vaccinated.

Therefore, the CDC should issue travel advisories that are prominently displayed on the roads leading to these hotspots so the rest of us don't stop for fuel or food. Government has a responsibility to protect people and help them avoid disease. Travel advisories might go a long way towards persuading people to use their head & stop listening to Donald."
2021-07-12 13:15,"My 91 year old mother, a former R.N., is alive in excellent health in assisted living.  She has no systemic or chronic disease.  The only medicine she is on is cholesterol medicine.
She's a normal weight and has never had surgery in her life except for 2 hip transplants.  She is able to walk unaided, bath unaided and eats normally.  She is mentally alert and reads every day and still manages her own finances.

This. article makes it obvious that if she needed EMCO, her age would mean she would not get it.

I have a close friend whose 99 year old mother, who like my mother is ambulatory, never smoked or drank alcohol and still lives in her home, would not qualify either.

The decision not to treat people over 50 or 60 - those most likely to die if they contract COVID - seems random and is largely determined by whether a person is wealthy or has been connected to the hospital community or is a public servant.

This is troubling."
2021-07-12 13:20,"ED doc here. This reporting makes it sound like ECMO is a lifesaving treatment. But the reality is that most adult patients treated with ECMO die, and in those that survive there is high risk of severe disability. The reality is that by the time someone needs ECMO they are probably going to die. 

We are better off focusing our resources on public health, mental health, and access to care— not incredible expensive treatments like ECMO."
2021-07-12 13:30,A little more science and explanation of the procedure and a lot less pathos and story telling  would have been greatly appreciated in this story.  ECMO was not explained until close to the end of the article.
2021-07-12 13:31,Get vaccinated.
2021-07-12 13:31,Start charging $100 for vaccine in a month and stop covering medical bills for unvaccinated. Nothing good is free & stupidly has a price.
2021-07-12 13:28,"And healthcare providers have to decide….

What decisions to have to live with."
2021-07-12 13:47,"It's disappointing that there is no discussion about Dr. Suarez's decision to put his patient on ECMO despite the hospital not having adequate staff to safely care for the patient. How many nurses had to take on dangerous assignments with three or four ICU patients so they could pull a one nurse or two nurses to take care of Dr. Suarez's ECMO patient every day, for what was surely a long course of care? When units are understaffed, things get missed and patients suffer devastating consequences, yet the author of the article seems to suggest that because the patient survived, what Dr. Suarez did was okay. How many other patients already in the hospital suffered consequences due to understaffing because of Dr. Suarez's decision?"

2021-07-12 13:55,These technologies are insanely expensive and distract from the reality that many other less expensive but critically important services could be offered to more patients who could then benefit from them. But this is a profit driven system.
2021-07-12 13:49,"Why is this left up to the family?  Why are scarce resources wasted because the family says so? 
Panels decide who gets a transplant.  Why don’t they decide who gets treatment?"
2021-07-12 13:54,"There are many complexities regarding the use of ECMO and patient selection that this article does not discuss. Patients with ARDS are typically cannulated for venovenous ECMO, which provides gas exchange but requires the native circulation/heart to be intact for perfusion. Venoarterial ECMO, which also provides circulatory support, is associated with higher rates of certain complications (e.g. neurological insult, worsening left ventricular hemorrhage, intracardiac thrombus) but VV ECMO is itself a very dangerous modality rife with complications; many of these are attendant consequences of the blood thinning medications required to keep the circuit flowing, while others have to do with the cannulation procedure itself or failure of the circuit. The rates of certain complications have improved as oxygenator technology has advanced, but the initiation of VV ECMO remains a vexing decision as we cannot adequately predict which patients will benefit and which patients will be stuck connected to the circuit without hope of recovery. Some dual lumen VV ECMO cannulae allow the patients to be taken off sedation to ambulate and participate in PT while awaiting lung recovery or transplant; one can imagine the horror that ensues if such a patient is no longer a transplant candidate or shows no sign of lung recovery and must be taken off. ECMO can be a life saving therapy but it is not always appropriate and its use demands serious contemplation and judicious patient selection"
2021-07-12 13:53,"This article should be required reading for those who ""don't trust"" the vaccine."
2021-07-12 13:39,"The scarcity of ICU beds and the personnel in charge of the critically ill patients brings back memories, back to the early 1970's, when, as Residents in General Surgery, we had to come to the agonizing need to 'choose' what to do when an ICU bed was needed by a new patient...yet still occupied by a dying patient...and the urgent need to talk to the patient and his/her family to 'call it the day', and be moved back to a regular ward...with dire consequences...and ending in death most of the times. Nowadays, however much we have made advances in science and technology, acute patient care remains brittle at best. Perhaps its in the nature of things, when our time is up. Even if justice leaves much to be desired, compassion ought to remain, and patient's best interest in mind. This shall remain a moral calling, imperfect as it is, our satisfying a 'calling' so filled with limitations we despair when the end comes calling...while our hands are tied in knots!"
2021-07-12 13:57,"Regarding the comments about people who didn't vax... That is correct.

To the anti-vaxxers, to the red-state governors... You believe in ""personal responsibility"", liberty, and the freedom to or not do something, even against all available science and evidence?

Well, here it is. THIS is what personal responsibility looks like. Enjoy your freedom, dead or barely alive.

I guess it's just tough noogies for the rest of us that your decisions affect everyone else."
2021-07-12 14:03,"75 yo retired ER doc here. It's time to talk about advanced directives. Because of the long term morbidity from ventilators, My AD directs that any ventilator support must be assessed after five days to see whether I'm a candidate to come off the ventilator. (by five days, it's often possible to tell whether the person will be able to live off the ventilator). If not, they direct that I should be allowed to pass normally, without heroic measures, including ECMO, tube feedings, etc. Take the decision making burden off my family. My 98 y.o. mother still wants full resuscitation, despite my remonstrances that she wouldn't survive. Chacun à son goût."
2021-07-12 14:51,"While this sounds shocking it goes on all the time in medicine.  People self ration when they decide not to go for needed medical care because it costs too much.  How many cases of untreatable illnesses are due to how our wealth care system functions?  How many Americans don't get any sort of medical care because of the cost?  How many lives are lost or ruined because of this?  

Rationing a last resort, extremely expensive treatment does make sense as long as it's done on the basis of need rather than wealth.  But people who need inexpensive medications to keep their blood pressure down, to regulate their diabetes, to regulate their thyroid functions, or to cure an infection should not have to ration their medical care.  If you need treatment for a broken bone the quality and length of care should not depend upon your employment status or what your insurance will cover.  And we should not have to fight with our insurance companies,  health care providers, or collection agencies after or during the period when we need medical care.  

There is nothing more alarming in this country, other than being unable to find a job, when it comes to requiring medical care for any condition.  Our entire system is designed to confuse and wear us down.  It leads to many of us avoiding medical care unless we're dying."
2021-07-12 14:14,"After reading this article I decided that if my life will ever hang on this little threat, that ECMO would be the last option to save me, I do NOT want it! 
Why? Well, I live a life which was not easy but it was so far fulfilling, my age plays not a role, you are as old as you feel. I know we do not live forever, and our bodies age and will one day give up. So why would I want to prolong this when its already coming so far down? To have some more moments with my family? I love my kids and my family and I cherish every moment with them, but It's life and it will  end one day. If a crazy gun man comes my way and shoots me to death, so be it, if I cross the street and a car hits me and I die, so be it. 
""Life is always life threatening"" said my favorite writer Erich Kaestner. 
It's better we care about a better living for us all, good healthcare and prevention to all, better job security for all, and living wages for all, this will make life less threatening but more fulfilling for all."
2021-07-12 14:14,"A person’s vaccination status should be part of the selection ECMO and ventilator criteria. Scarce treatment should be reserved for those who did their part in the fight against Covid. 

The unvaccinated aren’t even trying. Once hospitalized they will want every therapy available. Vaccinated first."
2021-07-12 14:29,"I am 68 years old. 
Two time cancer survivor, many illnesses in my past which I have survived. 
Just had a lone star tick bite me and I am coming out of a systemic wide infection, took the right right antibiotics, rested, lost five pounds, feel weak as a kitten. Three weeks in bed. 
I am vaccinated and now once again, I am afraid I will catch a variant that will kill me. On the rare occasions I do go anywhere, I wear masks and distance. I had the Moderna and I bless the scientists that gave us our lives back.
But the immunocompromised must be careful. 

The people who won’t get the vaccine are like a gun in the hands of a child. 
You endanger everyone. You exhaust and demoralize our healthcare workers. 
You only care about your twisted sense of personhood.
Sacrifice? You couldn’t walk one hour in the shoes of our doctors, nurses and first responders. 
I’m not a cruel person but I’m beginning to think unvaccinated adults should be at the last of the line for the dwindling resources. 

Except for your children…they have the disadvantage of your backward and suicidal ideas. 
If they become ill, we must attend to these kids. They need us. 
At least allow your teens to be vaccinated so they can have a normal life again. 
Don’t visit your ignorance on your kids."
2021-07-12 14:33,The pictures of Covid patients in an ICU make me wonder how anyone can think this is a hoax.
2021-07-12 14:49,"8 months ago, these horrible decisions had to be made because there was no vaccine. Now, 98-99% of them are in this state sue to vaccine refusal. At this point, why not prioritize 
children unable to be vaccinated and anyone who got ill despite being vaccinated?"
2021-07-12 14:52,"Get vaccinated folks.  How many terrible and sad stories do we need to read?  At this point, you are playing Russian Roulette and you know it.  You may not care or maybe you do but you are also putting everyone at risk being a potential variant maker.  Take the shot for God's sake."
2021-07-12 15:11,"Since the beginning of scientific medical care, the use of scarce resources has been a problem. I learned about it 50 years ago in my training. My daughter agonized about it in hers. 

It need not be this difficult. 

Lives are valuable, yes, but in SOCIETAL terms, lives matter in their ability to IMPROVE THE SOCIETY keeping them alive. Is this the RIGHT way? Who knows. Right or wrong, the decision to shift care sometimes must be made. 

Einstein at 22 would be of more societal value than at 82. If all else fails, save the children. They’re the future. 

Navel-gazing is counterproductive in emergencies. Make difficult decisions according to established guidelines and move on,"
2021-07-12 15:22,"As a transgender American, this is a standard of medical care I would never receive, even though my insurance is incredibly good (Obamacare).  Certain types of people aren't considered as worthy of living as others.

I remember when I suffered a back injury.  I went to a few physicians, and none of them even saw fit to order an MRI to determine what was going on.  My PT ""diagnosed"" it as a bulging disk and provided the care I needed for me to heal.  However, I still do not have sensation over part of my back.

Contrast that literally to my neighbor's dachshund that suffered the exact same injury within a few months of mine.  SHE got an MRI, and her PT was covered by insurance, unlike mine.

Two different Americas - one for privileged people and their privileged dogs, and another for the marginalized."
2021-07-12 15:00,"ECMO heroics aside the premise of this story (extraordinary care for all) is suspiciously stupid when vaccinations participation is far short of disease eradication levels. How many ECMO survivors were properly inoculated as a qualifications for the therapy?  ECMO was developed in the US by Robert Bartlett, MD, a cardiac bypass surgeon for NEONATAL medicine at Michigan.  Adult ECMO was then mostly unreliable and technologically difficult to standardize medically.  The ethics of neonatal ECMO is full of potholes as evidence the devastating disabilities associated with the therapy.  The ethics of COVID 19 (Adult ECMO) would fill the page count of the Library of Congress and this report failed to accurately describe the morbidity and mortality of this heroic however problematic procedure.  Every ounce of human energy should go into vaccination compliance and an ECMO patient care video should be required viewing.  ECMO often befuddles even the most ardent physician and nurse simply because of the multiplicity of variables and likelihood of bad outcomes."
2021-07-12 15:13,Not vaccinated?    Head to the back of the line where you can talk about how you made the right decision to the others who made the same choice
2021-07-12 15:20,"""ventilator shortages have largely been averted""

I remember when Cuomo was screaming that he'd be short of ventilators, and Jared Kushner said he was nuts, and people mocked Jared, and Jared was right for once in his life.  I'm still waiting for the NYT story on how the overuse of ventilators in New York early in the pandemic needlessly killed hundreds of patients; on how it was foolish of U.S. doctors to follow China's advice on venting too many Covid patients; of the huge wasteful spending and needless panic over ventilators last year, and how they're piled up unused in government warehouses.   But these stories aren't coming, are they?

Meanwhile, what has been missing and still is missing?  1. An ""Operation Warp Speed"" for adapting existing drugs for outpatient treatment of Covid (how many lives could have been saved)? 2. National random sample seroprevalence testing to determine the true extent of the spread of Covid and its variants.  Instead, what did we get from the government and the press? 1. Trump bad; 2. Vaccines will save us; 3. There are 2 Americas, one smart and one dumb."
2021-07-12 14:57,"This article lays bare many of the problems that our healthcare providers face on a regular basis and that are often worsened by the fractured manner in which health care is delivered in the US. Our health care systems faced a new challenge in the pandemic which they were not ready to face. The federal government's lack of maintenance of emergency medical supplies also contributed to this problem. There is no equity in health care in the US. To those of you who think there is, you are fooling yourselves. The cases reviewed here show how power and extreme advocacy and connections across health care systems and people can result in life or death. The lack of adequate numbers of ECMOs is based on the fact that hospitals do not buy such equipment because it costs too much. Many hospitals are limiting buying even less expensive equipment, including more basic supplies, because it will decrease their profit. Until we adopt a national health care program that removes profit for private individuals and groups, problems such as these will remain. Many people have learned a harsh lesson about our health care delivery institutions during this pandemic. It is probably broken in so many ways. To ""fix it"" will require a paradigm shift that it probably impossible. (Written by a doctorally educated registered nurse of 54 years who studied health policy and bioethics while delivering care to patients with end stage renal disease)."
2021-07-12 15:52,"As a medical student at Columbia Presbyterian in the mid 1980's I recall being sent on a quest to find one of the two new pulse ox machines that the hospital had.

This past fall i bought a pulse ox moniter from CVS for $25.

As technology improves likely ECMO will become easier and more available.

I can recall scores of patients who have died shortly before new therapies were made available that could have helped those patients. 

I think of each of them as a tragedy- time to see patient again."
2021-07-12 15:58,"I have not read a comment that mentions the one thing that seems to me to matter most when extreme treatments are not available to prolong life:  palliative care.  

I do agree that sometimes it will be necessary to let a patient go - not coldly in the service of some abstract sense of ethics, or guided entirely by principles grounded in a political economist's notion of resource-allocation, but rather because life itself forces choices upon us that cannot be avoided.  I see nothing wrong in judging decisions like these in terms of circumstances, with outcomes that may seem counterintuitive.  The nature of existence calls upon us all to accept the need for decisions of that character, with humility and grace on all sides.  We should consider ourselves fortunate if we are not the ones who must decide.

But it is all the more important that patients who cannot be saved are not abandoned to loneliness, pain or terror at the approach of death. Friends, family and hospice care need not be rationed.  We abound in palliative drugs, and should not feel constrained by abstractions against their use.  Of course a patient who does not want these consolations should not be forced to have them.  As for thoose who do, let them go gentle into that good night."
2021-07-12 16:16,"Military and civilian medical triage is about assessing the availability and the risk and the benefit of treatment.  
During this pandemic, most US hospitals were able to avoid going to emergency triage protocol standards.  But the experience has spotlighted the necessity of realistic assessment. 
When an elderly Covid patient in advanced stage dementia is intubated in ICU, that’s an ethical dilemma.  Even if the patient recovers physically from Covid, the risk of psychiatric effects from prolonged ventilation and the reality of the progressing dementia are real.  The effort contributes to the stress borne by the medical staff. 
There is a time to let go.  There’s a grace and a compassion in letting go."
2021-07-12 15:37,"The comments about not treating people who didn’t vax are appalling.  Should we not treat people who drink for diseases linked to drinking? How about obesity? People injured while committing crimes? Maybe we should only help vegetarian buddhists, everyone is on their own. 

How about no treatment or financial help for kids you can’t afford to raise on your own? 

Funny how so-called progressives all of a sudden want to leave people to die for stupid personal choices, when they think it involves Trump supporters (which isn’t even true, on a population basis)."
2021-07-12 15:15,"The anti-vaccine crowd should go to one another’s homes and sing their songs of freedom when they get Covid. They can nurse one another with their strange web/online inspired cures and stay away from the conspiracy driven hospitals. 
Wait…
I have been driven to the outer limits of my sanity because these anti-vaxxer Ameicans won’t get vaccinated. 
They are Trumpers. 
Do they know their King and Queen were quietly vaccinated before their majesties left the White House by the back door? 

For me, this is easy. 
It is a global pandemic. 
People must get vaccinated. 
If this were a measles pandemic everyone would be lined up getting a measles booster to save the lives of millions of people. 
Measles wasn’t politicized. 
But Trump politicized Covid 19 because in his own sick mind he thought he could make it work for him. 
Politicizing a deadly virus should be The Hague’s business. 
Our’s should be finding a way to get everyone vaccinated whether they like it or not. 
A deadly pandemic is not a personal freedom issue. It is a societal crisis. 
Let’s treat it as such from here on in."
2021-07-12 15:36,"When and if the nitwit faction does wise up and see the obvious re: COVID and vaccinations — it will unfortunately be too late. They will need vaccine #1, then wait two weeks, then vaccine #2, then wait two weeks.

There was one example of a skeptical zone of folks (along the Texas/Mexico border?) where COVID was rampant and killed many during the initial phases. When vaccinations became available, people rushed to get vaccinated. They had their proof by then. But that was what it took.

So now the nitwit zones need to repeat the tragedy? (Not really.)

The urgency and frustration from officials is understandable. Delta is already ramping up in problematic areas.


How is it not a prosecutable crime to be disseminating such disinformation? That literally kills people, endangers others, threatens the economy, the stability of the country? How is there no action that can be undertaken against such bad faith/sabotaging actors?"
2021-07-12 15:41,"ECMO is incredibly technically difficult and needs massive amounts of staff to accomplish. Outcomes are mediocre at best. Americans, you can not have everything that you want or demand. Both parties conspire to deny this. At the end of the day, someone is going to have to pay for this."
2021-07-12 15:52,"ECMO is not a lifesaving treatment. At best, it can marginally extend survival at a humongous cost and with a horrendous quality of life. The tiny fraction that survive to decannulation will have severe permanent disability. As with all the Covid coverage, this article is terribly misleading."
2021-07-12 16:08,"Most of the comments here are full of rage at people who refuse the vaccine. Which I get. I really, really do. But it’s really not relevant to this article, which is taking about people who got sick before the vaccines were available. Two of them, a doctor and a cop, got sick serving the public at tremendous personal risk. 

I think people find it easier to be angry at the anti-vaxxers than to deal with the very depressing, very difficult issues of end-of-life care, access, “heroic measures,” and rationing."
2021-07-12 15:52,No Vaccine? No Treatment.
2021-07-12 15:54,Ration it to those who have been vaccinated and those who have medical conditions that prevent vaccination.  Unvaccinated people by choice do not deserve such scarce treatments.
2021-07-12 15:59,"I don’t think it is right or ethical to judge a life based on someone’s job or PERCEIVED value to society.  What’s next?  I am scared to know.  ALL life has the same value.  Period. 

60 also seems very young as a cut off age.  Ageism is real, even in medical care."
2021-07-12 16:30,"At this point, priority for scarce Covid treatments should be given first to those who were vaccinated. Those who rejected vaccines or couldn't find time in the last six months to protect themselves with a vaccine should be sent to the end of the line after the vaccinated and those needing these treatments for other medical reasons. The unvaccinated tell us that they don't believe in medical treatment, so why should millions of dollars be spent each day giving it to them? I am sorry if that is harsh, but at a certain point we shouldn't waste resources trying to save those who wouldn't save themselves or others."
2021-07-12 16:28,"Vaccinated people who become ill, and those who for medical reasons can't get the vaccine should be first in line for ventilators and other life saving methods. Anti-vaxxers and Covid deniers shouldn't get access to these therapies since they don't believe in science and consciously chose to turn down prophylactic care."
2021-07-12 16:48,"This is of course heartbreaking, for the doctors and family.

It does sound like even if you are fortunate to be given this treatment (or any invasive treatment like a ventilator), should you survive your chances of coming back and having the same quality of life are vanishingly thin. How many people understand this, truly understand what their lives might be like? And then how many have communicated to their family what they want.

Honestly I’m in my mid-thirties and healthy, but if I were critically ill and facing a lifetime of needing nursing care, I honestly don’t know if I’d want that.  My husband and I are caring for my mother in law, who only in her mid 60s, is non ambulatory and cognitively impaired due to radiation treatment she got decades ago. She could live many years now but she needs help with all her daily activities of living. I’m not sure I’d want that for myself.

While not a good thing, I hope Covid has helped push people to think about how they want to live if continuing to live means a diminished quality of life, and filling out advance directives and making sure their families know their wishes.

And I hope it prompts doctors to communicate clearly the drawbacks of such treatments to patients and their families - you may survive but this is an arduous treatment to endure and you likely will not return to your previous state should you survive.

I bet more people and their families would be willing to let go if they understood the potential cost."
2021-07-12 16:27,We can’t just manufacture more? Seriously?
2021-07-12 16:40,"Going on two years later, and 5 trillion dollars spent, with millions of lives devastated, educations lost, economies in shambles, we have to ask: 
""How to choose which critically ill patients get it?""

Everyone gets ""lowering the curve"" in March 2020. But now?"
2021-07-12 17:11,"There are worse things than death as some ECMO patients find out with neurological and other issues that remain.

If you wanted to be fair when rationing ECMO, you would have to give it to vaccinated patients only since the non-vaccinated don't believe in science so they probably don't believe in ECMO either."
2021-07-12 17:35,Whenever hospitalised have your family or significant other  make certain that your living will is in the medical records. Your living will is based on your wishes and must be legally followed.  Having worked in health care I have rarely seen a patient regain previous level of function following significant medical procedures requiring vents.  ECMO may be life saving for some but will they resume their previous daily life activities?  It is the not the families' decision to make but rather the patient's as it is stated in his/her living will.
2021-07-12 16:54,"Except for people who are excluded because of health conditions, unvaccinated people should not be eligible for care."
2021-07-12 17:07,"This sort of dilemma has been part of health care since the notion of health care began, really, and it's the reason for triage used in every ER today.  Who needs care the fastest, who has the best chance of recovery, and so on, it's always a tough but necessary choice.  Liver transplants generally aren't done on people who destroyed their livers through alcohol abuse, because spare livers are rare, and because the patient is likely to destroy the new liver too.

In this case, I think the answer is simple enough, although people definitely won't like it.  I believe ECMO should only be done on patients younger than 12, who could not get the vaccine.  Right now, everyone over 12 years old in America has had the opportunity to get the vaccine.  Everyone who has refused to get the vaccine has chosen to risk death by covid-19.  Thus, all of the covid deaths in America today are among people who chose to take that risk, and I don't think any extreme measures should be done to save them.  But this viewpoint is partly because I'm rational about the impact of human overpopulation on the environment; what the world needs more than anything else is fewer humans.  We have to realize that as a society, or humanity will drive enough species extinct that we go extinct as well."

   Providers need to get better training to say to a family that despite their best efforts the patient is dying.  As a bedisde nurse in a MICU during COVID I heard over and over that the medical staff was waiting for the family to ""decide to stop treatment"".  That is unfair to patients and the families.  There was no decision.  The disease had decided already. There needs to be more honesty about a critically ill patient's prognosis and when to stop.  To do otherwise is unethical."

2021-07-12 17:39,"In extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), blood is circulated from the patient's body to a heart-lung machine that removes carbon dioxide and sends oxygen-filled blood back into tissues in the body.  It compensates for severely weakened heart and lung function.  One ECMO machine costs about $220K.  Only 264 of the 6,000 U.S. hospitals have the ability to perform ECMO.   Because of geographic distribution, only 58.5% of the adult US population has access to an ECMO-capable center. 

ECMO's should thus be rationed based based on population.   Attempt to evenly distribute the ECMO's across the 435 US Congressional Districts.  Districts with 70%+ vaccination rates (i.e., VT, MA, ME, CT) will have adequate ECMO's.   Districts with very low (< 40%) vax rates (i.e., AL, MS, AR, WY, LA) will suffer.  But the ECMO distribution will be equitable, and based on science."
2021-07-12 18:23,"When I read articles like this I feel so many things.  Sorrow, love and identification with the Sargeant and his family. All those I’ve know who have suffered. Fear for sure; as an asthmatic I know how terrible it is to not be able to breathe. 

But lately the complete avoidablity of all this absolutely enrages me.  I knew America was in a bad way, but it never, ever for a moment occurred to me that so many Americans could watch tragedies like those described in this article play out 620,000 times and do nothing.

2021-07-12 18:18,"It must be incredibly heart- breaking experience for the entire health team to make life-saving decisions that favor few while denying most the chance for their lungs to rest and recover with ECMO. Arguably the relatives of each patient would consider their loved one teetering in life-death situation to be equally well-qualified to benefit from this gadget. To make these decisions, often several times in the past year must create sadness, and guilt among health care givers. Guidelines will understandably take more time to be refined.  Lessons will be learned before the new epidemic, books will be written and scientific papers published. Data will be collated, parsed from different centers and polished with nuances by medical experts and ethicists from centers of excellence having considerable body  of experience in treating Covid patients with ECMO.    
There are glaring inequities in health care that range from getting a screening mammogram, colonoscopy or basic preventative health care, let alone the prospect being treated by cutting edge technology. Paying the hospital bills must take the life out of survivors 
 if they return home to breathe own their own as insurance coverage is lacking.
Once the epidemic dies down and normalcy is restored with vaccination there would be more ECMO machines that would be idling and the cost of these machines will be the focus of debate."

In a pandemic, a hospital that’s massively overloaded, with limited resources, with an exhausted staff, simply shouldn’t be doing ECMOs. Especially since at best, you’re talking about a fifty percent death rate, with survivors almost certainly looking at months of rehab, permanent serious impairment, and often a two-lung transplant. Which by the way, has a truly lousy five-year survival rate. 

Sorry and I get it, I’d probably feel the same, but this is classic, “cold equations,” stuff.

Consider that these same deniers likely voted for Trump & republicans in congress who are trying to make voting harder, who intend to usurp our elections and hand pick the winners, who deny access to Obamacare in their states, and deny healthcare to pregnant women based on THEIR religious views they would impose on everyone else.

IMO, our society is better off if they are at the end of the ventilator line."

2021-07-12 20:19,"I am disturbed by the number of comments suggesting withholding care from unvaccinated patients. I understand the frustration with and even the contempt for many of the people who choose not to get the shot. However, withholding care from someone who comes to medical attention on the basis of the choices made by the patient is a monstrous proposition that is in contravention of fundamental principles of clinical ethics. Most decisions for most people are really not volitional; people do not choose to believe certain things and disbelieve others, those are processes that occur below the level of intentional or conscious awareness. In other words, vaccine hesitancy is a sociological phenomenon with complex, multifarious causes, and at the level of the population it is unhelpful to boil down these large scale social phenomena to a series of selfish decisions by large swaths of individuals. I am also angry at those refusing to get the vaccine, and I want to grab them and yell at them and show them images of ICU patients clockwork orange style, but conflating individual attitudes with population wide trends is fallacious and does not admit the complexity underlying this issue. It is a serious problem but it cannot be addressed by meting out such cruel punishment to specific individuals who did not get the vaccine. We must be better than this."
2021-07-12 20:32,"The COVID-19 virus is not a “hoax.” If you have not taken the move to get vaccinated, better you do so now before you become a victim of what is clearly not a “hoax.” Leaving it up to doctors to decide if you are the one to get the ventilator, is not a wise decision."
2021-07-12 20:32,"After the first paragraph I thought this was going to be about the difficult triage choices forced upon doctors and families.

But on further reading that the subsequent recipient also died this suggests that perhaps the real lesson here is that complex, cutting-edge treatments such as ECMO are just not efficacious for treating Covid victims?

It appears that the survival rate of critical Covid patients is simply too low to even justify using ECMO."

The rest is - as the expression goes - Darwinism at work. 

Sorry to be so callous, but the information has been out for quite some time now. Been there, done that with smallpox and polio. I've lost compassion for the people who refuse to get vaccinated.

Lack of capacity -  Beds?  Personnel?

Unvaccinated residents -  Does that refer to citizens in the area?  Resident physicians?

Broader utility for lung failure - Broader than what?"

Simple solution when shortages occur and tough choices need to be made. Triage cases with several simple questions; Did you mask?, Did you vaccinate when available? If no to either, then a third question. Were these choices due to medical conditions or politically induced. If political, then send them home to self-medicate."

1.  The staffing resources to provide ECMO are huge.  In effect, providing ECMO may reduce resources of people and expertise to care for a larger number of seriously ill ICU patients.
2.  ECMO has its own complications, including issues relating to blood clotting.

A patient going on ECMO and his family must understand that it is a technique to buy time to allow the body to heal, but it is not guaranteed that it will work."

It looked like there, a patient didn't stand a chance without a family member running around pulling strings to secure their loved one's care, whether it was to get them oxygen, or a hospital bed, or a proper burial.  It's humbling, the recognition that things are actually like that here too."

2021-07-12 23:43,"Obviously, this makes even more troubling the phenomenon of unvaccinated patients (and possibly those who also resisted masks) showing up at hospitals in increasing numbers.  It is one thing to risk one's own life, but to risk those of others, both by spreading the infection and depriving others of necessary treatment in a system in which we have to compete for  options, is unconscionable.  I think for many of us, one of the most frightening aspects of the pandemic is the stark revelation of the selfishness and even narcissism of too many of our fellow-citizens.  Now the masks are coming off and we are still far away from a solution to this nightmare.  Fortunately, the article did not have examples of the selfish ones, as both the physician and the police officer were infected while serving others."
2021-07-12 23:55,"This story is one reason my wife and I have advance directives on file at our local hospital and with our doctors. We decided years ago that we did not want extraordinary measures taken to keep us alive.
 That said, we both have gotten vaccinated for Covid-19. Especially now, it is not fair to put medical professionals in the position of who lives or dies."
2021-07-12 23:57,"This is infuriating. I live in LA, we spend a fortune on healthcare, we have crazy huge health bureaucracies at state, county and city levels and ... we still don't have centralized systems tracking bed or resource availability. 

We are literally still in the 1950s, with nurses calling around to find beds, waiting to get calls returned. With patients losing out because someone was off that day and no one checked their voicemails."
2021-07-13 0:17,What is missing from the whole conversation on those who are unvaccinated and then require hospitalization is the question of who is paying for their care?  I highly doubt that the people refusing vaccinations are adequately insured for the costs of their care should they become seriously ill. Should we all be paying for their “personal freedoms”?  Is is right for our healthcare costs to increase because they thought more of themselves than of the greater good?  I think not.  People who are unvaccinated should pay higher insurance premiums in case they require extraordinary healthcare interventions. It’s not much different than higher premiums for people who choose to smoke.  You make your decisions and you live with the consequences.

2021-07-08 15:54,"I had a mild case of Covid several months ago, and having been in peak physical shape when it occurred, I can say it took me nearly 4 months to get back to something resembling that shape.  There was a clear impact on my heart rate during vigorous exercise (12-15 bpm extra) to the point I dusted off my Fitbit to see what my resting bpm was like.  My resting heart rate is still 5+ bpm higher many months later.

All that said, I had a really bad stomach bug years ago.  Wiped me out worse than Covid, to the point even attempting to exercise in the weeks after was impossible.  I'm also aware, anecdotally, of better athletes than me who had entire seasons upended because of influenza, mono, or something else.

Point being, ""long Covid"" might be a thing, but we don't know that it's any more of a thing than what other illnesses do to us.  I wish NIH would expand these sorts of long term studies or trials to compare Covid to other coronaviruses, influenzas, etc."
2021-07-08 16:55,"Last July, my son had Covid and I may have had an asymptomatic case of Covid. Since July 2020, I have have periods where my skin and mouth break out in sores, my nails are really strong (never the case before) and, I have periods when my average heart rate is higher for weeks on end. I can feel it but since I don’t have insurance, I just struggle through. I have noted during these periods, I am more tired and breathless. I keep up my active routine because, hey, the dogs don’t walk themselves. It worries me but nothing can be done about it."
2021-07-08 20:19,"I haven't had COVID (that I know of) but this story rings true for me.  Years ago I was road cycling nearly every day and could usually use HR to spot a cold coming 1.5 days before symptoms hit, similar to the 2 days cited in one of the references.

No longer doing cardio but you can definitely see the body reacting to a variety of viruses.  Resting HR may go up, BP may go up, weight might drop 1-3 lbs overnight as your body uses more water in various ways to fight a virus. You can also see how fast HR and BP return to normal after exercise.

Taste and appetite may be down-regulated as the body devotes maximum resources (which might involve burning fat and catabolizing muscle, and minimizing energy spent on digestion) in the virus fight.  

That's the body talking to you and if you really want to get fancy you can measure inflammatory markers (CRP, TNF-a, IL-6, sed rate, etc.)  And for those who claim COVID is nothing special, based on the medical research you can see differences in the more esoteric markers (LDH, d-dimer, etc.)

But HR, BP and weight will do just fine and you don't need a Fitbit, IMO.  Although I'd probably get one. The thing you don't know, however, is precisely what (or how many) viruses your system is responding to, and, if COVID, how ""capable"" your immune system is.  I find the body's response can vary a lot.  Just need to establish a baseline and go from there. 

Of course, the other indicator is fatigue; ability to do whatever exercise you're doing."
2021-07-08 23:40,"I'm still suffering from the last of my long-term covid symptoms. The worst now being very disruptive sleep and a now slightly elevated heart rate. My resting heart rate at its worse was 90-100 bpm. My normal heart rate has historically been 60-68 bpm. I still will get mild chest pain, but that is now less frequent than a few months ago. Prior to covid I ran several miles a day and worked out 1-2 hours a day. I now only walk for long distances for fear of stressing my heart. I and other long-term covid sufferers also experienced weakness in our knees which might be caused from lack of activity. 

Some have mentioned other sickness having similar long-term effects. I've had horrible weeks long flus, colds, stomach viruses, but my body has always quickly bounced back. The horrible aspect about long-term covid is in its name. The length of time it is taking to get back to normal is maddening. As an aside, I've read many articles stating that even those with miild symptoms have shown significant lung damage even though they may not realize it. Covid-19 is a new virus beast and we need to understand its long term affects on the body."
2021-07-09 1:39,"I thought I was being paranoid. I had COVID at the end of March. Now in the first week of July, my heart rate - especially my resting heart rate during sleep is definitely higher than it was before. I am out of breath more also. I thought I was just being weak and should buck-up and deal with it. It's definitely not fun but I'm glad to know why it's happening, and that it's not just me."

What is it about ""excellence"" that the IOC does not understand?"
2021-07-08 10:21,How can you have an enormous international athletic event during a pandemic? What is the matter with the organizers? It’s not like they didn’t have warning. This pandemic has been going on for a year and a half with no end in sight. Use common sense people.
2021-07-08 11:26,I read elsewhere about a week ago that there are some athletes participating in the games from some other countries who aren’t vaccinated or planning to get vaccinated! So there isn’t a mandate. Unbelievable.
2021-07-08 11:47,There is no place I wd rather be to watch the Olympics than in my blue recliner in my living room sipping tea or wine.
2021-07-08 11:28,"The current European soccer championships show what can happen if you allow mass spectators: no masks, no distancing, neither in the stadiums nor outside. Cases will surge massively in the UK. They have already surged in Scotland, Finland and Russia, after fans traveled to the UK and Russia to support their teams. This is not only reckless regarding the local population - it is also an incubator for new variants, which may put the entire world at risk. It is amazing how stupid the governments, sport officials and fans are to engage in this type of spectacle. The fans of course believe that it would be safe if authorized by the governments.  But it is not."
2021-07-08 11:37,Why would anyone go to Tokyo for this?  Japan has done a terrible job with vaccinations.  Exposing yourself to this risk to watch an athletic event is absurd.
2021-07-08 11:42,"In the midst of the covid pandemic, the decision to go ahead with the Tokyo Olympics Games is delusional at best.

But we know the ultimate values that top sports attributes - ¥ ¥ ¥ and of course, $$$"
2021-07-08 11:32,"Cancel the Olympics already, and for good. A wasteful, white elephant, with years of declining ratings, run by an organization well known for its disfunction. The Olympics are an environmental and development nightmare and are no longer suited for the 21st Century. Alternatively, find a permanent spot and host them there. Seriously, all the energy, funds, and people power dedicated to this carnival of idiocy could be better spent on accelerating vaccine production and deployment to the rest of the world and solving some of its more pressing problems."
2021-07-08 12:03,"While we would all love to see an inspiring display of unity and internationalism, now is not the time. Some countries participating in the Olympics have yet to administer a single vaccine dose until recently, and we know vaccines (especially the already-less-efficacious vaccines) to be less efficacious against the delta variant.

But perhaps the most convincing reason is that a vast majority of the Japanese public (who, I will add, are consistent mask wearers when they have any respiratory illnesses) think this is a terrible and dangerous idea."
2021-07-08 12:31,"The Japanese public and the medical community don’t want the Olympics, but the sports marketing juggernaut led by NBC are desperate for the games to go on. Throughout the pandemic, TV revenues have overruled common sense at every turn. How do news folks like NBC’s Savannah Guthrie and sports writers rationalize their participation?"
2021-07-08 12:17,"Once again, money trumps common sense."

2021-07-08 12:00,Poor Japan. They got the olympics at the worse possible time.  Dark humor here. It has just been announced that the games will go on but the competitors will not be allowed to compete.
2021-07-08 12:36,“Commerce over common sense” will be the epitaph of the human race.
2021-07-08 12:28,The Olympics should be cancelled. Japan  showed weak leadership in these crazy times.
2021-07-08 12:42,No one I repeat no one wants the Olympics except the IOC and the athletes (some of them). To play these unnecessary games where the athletes are exploited and the host city loses millions in the midst of a pandemic is downright atrocious. Those in charge should be tried as criminals allowing this to occur!
2021-07-08 12:44,"Time to get rid of the olympics as we know it. Events can be held in existing venues around the world. The cost would be minimal. Athletes would still be able to compete. Revenue would be shared by many sites around to world. The environment would benefit from not having the wasteful building. The only ""dowside"" would be the that the tyranical olympic committee would not be able to dictate terms, nor would they get so much money that they DO NOT DESERVE!"
2021-07-08 12:47,"We all remember endless crowd shots during the opening and closing ceremonies of every Olympics within memory -- of stadiums packed with spectators and camera flashes sparkling on the screen, of throngs of athletes marching proudly into the stadiums shoulder to shoulder, and spectators waiving and shouting in support of their teams.  And of course we all remember the opening and closing extravaganzas put on by the host countries, with tributes to their respective histories and lofty symbols of peace and hope for the future.

It will certainly be interesting to see how NBC covers the Tokyo Olympics, and how Japan handles the opening and closing ceremonies in an era completely upended by SARS-CoV-2.  I wouldn't want to be in NBC's or the Tokyo Olympic Committee's shoes right now, but the whole thing should make for some riveting television, with spectators reduced to a smattering of people and athletes practicing social distancing -- or whatever.

Let the games begin!"
2021-07-08 12:51,"The IOC has everything to win, and Japan has everything to lose, so the IOC is requiring Japan to proceed. Contractually, I doubt Japan has a choice. The IOC makes billions off of television broadcasts, merchandise and endorsements, while host countries who host the Olympics typically lose money.

There needs to be a new paradigm for Olympic events. Perhaps they should be held at the same location each cycle, and all participating countries share in the profits that are supposedly generated. Let the arguments begin."
2021-07-08 12:55,"In the big picture proceeding with an Olympics at this time is a reckless selfish decision, based on economic considerations and the disappointment of the athletes. Both of those reasons fail to push forward the world effort to end the pandemic on our planet.  

Since there is a finite chance the games will lead to suffering and needless deaths either directly or indirectly, all I have the power to do is not pay attention to the games this year or ever again - and post my feelings in the NYT."
2021-07-08 12:58,"Mr. Suga pledged to deliver an Olympic Games that would go down in history not as another victim of the pandemic, but as an example of fortitude in the face of adversity.

Viewers will be tuning in from around the world, he said, and “I want to transmit to them a message from Tokyo about overcoming hardship with effort and wisdom.”

PUHLEEEZ! It’s a TV pageant, nothing more. The message that Mr. Suga and the IOC are sending has nothing whatsoever to do with fortitude in the face of adversity. It’s just another tribute to the power of greed."
2021-07-08 13:06,"As a global society we are in that midway scene in the movie JAWS in which the mayor declares the beach is safe because a small white shark was captured. And the people were quick to rejoice and rush to their demise. The corollary between this scene and the global response to covid, which is fast mutating while billions remain unvaccinated and unmasked, strikes this reader as so sadly clear. I feel like I’m privy  to an open secret. 
I’ll be wearing my mask and taking rational covid precautions til the end of this movie, thank you very much."
2021-07-08 13:30,Obviously have to go forward at this point. No spectators seems like a good compromise solution.
2021-07-08 13:46,"For too many, the bottom line is that any risk is too much and any benefit is too little. Those who think this way lack a firm tie to reality. 

These are the first Olympics in 5 years. And the good will that comes from competition  among the best from around the world is immense in so many ways. That surely justifies some level of public health risk. 

Japan’s public health risk is quite low. And if there are vaccinated crowd sections, risk would be quite low. The American trials used vaccinated sections and no superspreading events apparently occurred. 

Can we put this matter in perspective and drop the hysteria?  Vaccinated sections are likely to work in Japan as well as in the US. And the benefits appear to far outweigh the costs. 

Let the Games begin and let them have a soundtrack of enthusiastic fans in attendance. Nobody with unchecked fears makes it to the Olympics. The costs are pretty much known and  have proven small. The athletes will weather the risks and have the time of their lives. There is risk for sure but the fears of many are way out of proportion. 

If maximum precaution were the rule of the day, there would be no marathon and no boxing, no pregnant women could compete, and neither would any athlete from an Ebola country or with HIV. Risks are everywhere. But large crowds of vaccinated fans in Tokyo are worth the risk."
2021-07-08 13:47,"I am not a fan of the Olympics. 

I lost interest when the event moved from amateur athletes to basically paid athletes. 

Japan should have postponed the 2021 event until such a time that the pandemic was under control. 

Unfortunately it is all about the money when discussing the Olympics. 

There will be very limited public attendance at any of the torch ceremonies or the stadium events. 

So why have the Olympics now?"
2021-07-08 13:53,"When the one year delay was announced last year, I thought a two year delay made more sense.  That would have allowed more vaccinations, more education on the virus, and it would have given the world another year to resume 'normal' operations in terms of travel, commerce, and regular human activity.  Now that we are a few weeks away, the games look to be going on as scheduled, albeit severely scaled down.  No spectators probably makes sense; but it will be an awkward sight watching athletes line up for their event starts and see completely empty stands.   I thought I read, though it could have changed, that athletes would need to depart the country shortly after their last event.  That should make a rather odd closing ceremony.  But at this  point, just get the games done and over with and hope it does not turn into a superspreader event.  Fingers crossed."
2021-07-08 13:53,"No spectators seems the best solution. As for the athletes, they will be quarantined and sequestered the entire time they are there. They have all been vaccinated, will be tested daily, not allowed to mingle freely with other athletes in the Olympic village, and only allowed in the country for a limited time during which they will compete. The number of Japanese staff will be limited to those absolutely necessary for the smooth running of the events, and they will also be tested daily. These precautions seem adequate. The athletes have trained for years for this. For some, this may be the last  chance they have to participate. The games should go ahead, and the world will watch and cheer the events on television."
2021-07-08 13:23,Money over people's lives once again.
2021-07-08 13:38,"With the world still in the midst of a pandemic with very few people vaccinated we are going to bring human petri dishes from all over the world and put them all in one location to incubate for a few weeks before sending them all back to their unvaccinated countries.

And, for what??

What could go wrong?"
2021-07-08 13:23,"The world is us an uproar on a variety of fronts;,the Covid pandemic and now transportation industry unable to be accountable.  It would be a death wish to start playing “games” until order and safety in all arenas is established."
2021-07-08 13:32,Cancel it. It’s a disaster in waiting.
2021-07-08 13:44,The world needs the olympics and they can be done safely with all athletes being vaccinated. In-person spectatorship is not necessary; we can all enjoy the event together at home and in open-air parks.
2021-07-08 13:28,"As America and Europe begin to reopen their economies after the tragedies endured during the COVID plague, for some inexplicable reason we've seen that Japan's recovery resembles India's and Brazil's far more than it does other developed countries.  Knowing the Olympics were on the horizon and wanting to press on with the Games, I don't understand how Japan's government could have been so incompetent in rolling out the vaccines.  There is no question that in times of crisis, having a competent government is the difference between life and death.  We've seen this here in the US when during the first half of the plague we became overwhelmed due to a president who did his best to INHIBIT sensible public health policies.  Thankfully with Biden's election, we vastly accelerated our health response and stemmed the tide of death and can now reap the hard won rewards.  WHY has the Japanese leadership, once again, shown itself to be wholly incapable of governing in a MODERN and EFFICIENT manner?  If Japan had started to administer the vaccine en masse when Europe and America did, this wouldn't be an issue that we're all now facing regarding the Olympics.  What an unnecessary and sad state the athletes will find when they arrive in Tokyo.  What should have been a world celebration showing how we overcame, at great cost, this horrendous plague, will instead be a reminder of what happens when people FAIL in their duty to protect each other."
2021-07-08 13:46,"The Olympics are not what they used to be. The number of different sports keeps growing, skateboarding? It's all about money. Sad. Going ahead under the current circumstances is a mistake. Think about how many countries are sending their athletes when the third/fourth wave is hitting. I hope the TV ratings send the message that the world no longer cares."
2021-07-08 14:16,"I am very sorry to read of the sudden spike in new cases of this virus.

I am alarmed and troubled that a similar scenario may occur on this side of the world, especially after the July 4th holiday weekend when so many people continue to act as if COVID is just a distance memory in many a rear view mirror.

Not even half of this country is fully vaccinated.  The Delta variant continues to pick up momentum.  I feel as if it's more of a question of WHEN rather than IF new covid cases will begin to spike over here."
2021-07-08 14:19,"Japan has one of the lowest infection rates in the world. England’s current rate of infection is 41 times higher. Of course there is still risk, but not the risk that England is taking by holding Euro 2020 in packed stands this week."
2021-07-08 14:27,"Seriously, just cancel the Games this year.  Those who made the Olympic teams can be proud of that accomplishment."
2021-07-08 14:29,"Good enough.  Keep out the spectators and let the games go on.  Meanwhile, the euros march forward with barely a whisper of criticism."
2021-07-08 14:33,"As usual, it's all about the Benjamins.  Japan has spent  millions (if not billions) prepping for the Games.  Pulling the rug out from under them at the 11th hour in spite of it being the right and proper thing to do, is simply not an option."
2021-07-08 14:50,"Countries should need to pay a tax (if they can afford it) to send athletes to the olympics. Japans vaccination campaign has been pitiful at best, and the Delta variant is quickly dominating cases in the country. I hope I’m wrong, but am very confident there will be an uptick in cases following the olympics in Japan, and countries sending athletes should take a reasonable amount of responsibility for this.

Japanese citizens will be hospitalized if not worse as a result of them hosting the olympics. Nations that can, should send vaccines, and PPE to the Japanese as a point of gratitude, and recognition of the risk they took in hosting so many international athletes during times like these."
2021-07-08 14:51,"It's easy for readers to say, ""Just cancel the Games again."" We stand to lose nothing from another cancellation. What about Japan? They truth is, countries clamor to host the games for the enormous exposure and revenue it provides and Japan had to cancel once already. And what about the athletes? They've already trained 5 years for it. No matter what their motivation is for sport, 5 years is a long time to train. COVID isn't going away, nor are its variants. Should the Olympics be cancelled forever? Tokyo is acting appropriately under these very trying circumstances."
2021-07-08 14:57,"Why on earth does a wealthy, developed, organized country like Japan have something like a 15% vaccination rate?? 
I read somewhere that Australia has less than 10% vaccination rate. It's all fine and good to have stemmed the tide in the early stages by keeping potential infectors out, but for Pete's sake these countries have the money and organizational skills to roll out a vaccine, why haven't they done it!?"

2021-07-08 13:55,"With a seven per cent vaccination rate, no widespread natural immunity in the population and a highly contagious variant of COVID now predominant, Japan is making the correct decision in banning spectators from the Olympics. I hope this inconvenience jolts the Japanese government from its lethargy and impels it to vaccinate its population. 
Both Japan and Australia are now shutting down because of the threat of the Delta variant. Both Japan and Australia have vaccination rates that are disgracefully low for rich countries. I doubt either Japan or Australia face the extreme social issues that plague our country and both countries could have afforded to prioritize the vaccine as Israel did. Why those two rich, intelligent nations did not pursue vaccination with greater urgency eludes me."

2021-07-08 14:24,"This was of course totally predictable in spite of prolonged Japanese  insistence and rigidity in the face of a worldwide pandemic which is not going to go away soon, especially when  fools are allowed to be encouraged to gather together without masks, and remain unvaccinated.  World wide celebrations of any kind are just not in the best interest of those who value a fully functional future and want to stay healthy and alive...tough love, but that is the way it is.  The sooner everyone gets with the program, the sooner safety will return.  Sorry it is not any different, kids.  Time to GROW UP!"
2021-07-08 14:48,"Time to have a serious look at these transnational organizations, like the IOC. They run amok, without any transparency, including financial, and seem to have a complete disregard  towards other people's interest, but their own profit."
2021-07-08 14:41,"I know that Japan as host nation, and all the participating nations, do not want to cancel the 2020 Olympic Games that have already been postponed until later this month.  It is an extremely hard decision considering the dollar amounts expended, all the preparation and logistics undertaken and the training put in by each competing athlete.

But we're still in a worldwide pandemic, cases of Covid-19 are still occurring and in many countries  increasing, deaths are still taking place, and most of the world still remains unvaccinated.  Accordingly, the Olympic Games should be cancelled for the safety of the athletes, their coaches, judges, media and journalists covering and reporting on the Olympics, and others who will be present in Tokyo in some Olympics-related capacity.  

The Olympics were cancelled in 1940 and 1944 due to WWII.  The 2020 Olympics should likewise be cancelled due to the worldwide Covid-19 pandemic.  It's the only logical, reasonable and safest decision to take."
2021-07-08 14:35,"Now that they’ve banned spectators, they need to ban the athletes. They need to postpone the games until next summer, vaccinate the Japanese people, and mandate that anyone coming to the games, whether to compete or observe, also be vaccinated. This could have been done for this summer, but it wasn’t."
2021-07-08 14:45,"Yes, COVID 19 has its own timetable. This has been the case since the former president first predicted it would just fade away. The Olympics themselves are in jeopardy now, but, of course, the Games have been in jeopardy from the get-go. Gathering all the peoples, infected and uninfected, from around this pandemic ravaged planet may simply be a bad idea. Period."
2021-07-08 14:47,"Japan offers the world an International Public Service. Thank you, Japan!"
2021-07-08 14:48,It’s the right decision. Cancelling the Olympics would be better.
2021-07-08 15:08,"And a month or so from now the members of the IOC will fly off as the pandemic ravages Japan, brought there and sent back out to the world as a more virulent and deadly strain, The leaders will shrug their shoulders and say things like ‘acted on best advice’ and ‘best practices’ absolving themselves of any culpability. 

Where is the outrage? It is not too late to stop this insanity."
2021-07-08 15:09,"No mention here of any pressure being put on the Games organizers by NBC Universal to hold the games this year. From an article in Forbes:

""Comcast reported the 2016 Summer Olympics garnered $1.62 billion in revenue resulting in an estimated profit of $250 million.

In June 2011, Comcast had outbid Fox Sports and ESPN for the media rights to cover the four Olympics from 2014 through 2020. Comcast paid the International Olympic Committee (IOC) $4.38 billion ($1.1 billion for each Olympic). 

In June 2014, NBCU extended their agreement with the IOC to secure U.S, broadcast, online and mobile rights for the Summer and Winter Olympics from 2022 through 2032 at a cost of $7.75 billion ($1.275 billion for each Olympiad) an increase of 16% per Olympic games. 

The U.S. broadcast rights has been a primary revenue source for the International Olympic Committee (IOC).""

At last report, NBC Universal has planned 7000 hours of combined TV coverage across multiple networks. As others have commented, it is indeed ""all about the Benjamins."" Money trumps common sense (and strong medical advice!)"

2021-07-08 14:55,"So the United States let infections run wild in 2020, most people who are tuned in are familiar with the driving forces why (yes, Trump is a child, freedom, 'Merica, Bill Gates all all).  But here we stand yet again and people are fretting over variants and taking the media click bait over infection numbers in a developed nation.  Covid is no longer new, there is ample data where there is truly risk in populations, and it is not going away so it's time to live with it.    

What is the excuse for such a pathetically low vaccination rate in a wealthy and highly-structured society as Japan?   They clearly have done too little too late on that front and people instead want to talk about a problem that has a solution.  'Oh my God so many infections!  Cancel the games!'  Why instead aren't we now, and hasn't there been, a push in all developed nations to get at-risk populations vaccinated?  They also have as many deaths to date as a single mid-sized US state.  Did they plan to manage and just mitigate their way out of this indefinitely?  

Are people going to lose their minds when the next flu 'variant' comes this year?  Speaking as one of the majority who took the threat seriously when it was one, it's about time for the anxiety levels to lower and focus on the solution and understand the problem in today's context - not summer of 2020 - if we're speaking about any developed nation and things like large organized events."

2021-07-08 15:04,"Even without the pandemic, this Olympic was fraught from its inception. When Tokyo hosted the Summer Games the first time in 1964, it did so in October - the time of the year in Tokyo with the most favorable weather.
This time, they're hosting in the hottest and most humid period in Tokyo, all because TV networks that are revenue generators for IOC don't want the games to compete for airtime with football (both American and world) and other major sports.
It's a combination of ineptitude of Japanese officials who don't have the spine to stand up to demands stemming from greed of IOC  (a group of arrogant, old, Western men - sadly, nothing has changed since Commodore Matthew Perry effectively home invaded Japan in 1853).
Athletes will suffer from having to compete in sauna or be taxed from repeated discombobulating exposure to both the AC and outside conditions, as well as majority of Japanese general public who are yet to be vaccinated: there are already reports that some of the athletes and their support staff have tested positive upon entering Japan."
2021-07-08 15:09,Good on Japan for not living in fear.

2021-07-08 15:11,The Japanese public overwhelmingly wanted the Olympics cancelled/further postponed a long time ago. But once host countries kiss the IOC ring all control is lost. The IOC is thoroughly selfish to press ahead with the Olympics during a global pandemic that is far from over.

There are athletes in the olympuc village who have tested positive- hopefully they will not occupy a hospital bed."
2021-07-08 16:10,"Japan is a developed nation with a shared sense of national unity.  So where does Japan stand as far as vaccinations go?

According to Google's tracking, Japan stands at just over 15% vaccinated as of 2 days ago.

I think that just about sums up Japan shooting itself in the foot as far as the Olympics go."

2021-07-08 16:36,"Olympians compete for four years before extremely sparse crowds. But every four years that changes. I go to the track trials whenever I can. The crowds clap rhythmically during the long jump and make more noise if the jumpers request. One competitor in all white and a ten gallon hat got the most noise of all. During the 10,000 the clapping is in waves as the runners go around the oval 25 times. There were two world records and the noise went on and on. And a 17 year old sprinter sprinted past the finish line and just kept sprinting until he was out of sight. 

The athletes and fans run on four years of pent up energy. And the whole thing is pumped up another level because Hayward Field  is a track temple and has been forever. 

Olympic sports crowds tend to be fanatic. They know their sport and its stars and some can tell a world record without a stopwatch or a yardstick. And they make four years of waiting for the athletes worth it. 

Without a crowd, the Olympics are just a big meet. And there’s no way the performances will be the same. The loss is huge. Whatever it means for revenues, it means more for the competition. 

. It’s up to someone else to decide if barring fans is worth it. But I hope they don’t lock themselves in if things get better. If they let in even a small crowd, there will be plenty of noise."
2021-07-08 16:37,"On 7 Sep 2013, Japan won her bid to host the 2020 Summer Olympics.  It is now July 2021. The Tokyo Summer Olympics (and Paralympics) will take place this month and first week September. The Olympic Games were canceled for the duration of World War II. Did anyone predict in 2020 that the Covid-19 Pandemic would still be infecting most countries in the world today?  We can't redo the past. Japan coulda shoulda  postponed the Tokyo Summer Olympics. So this summer's Tokyo Games will take place sans spectators but with a virtual zoom worldwide audience watching from afar."
2021-07-08 16:43,"It’s time to send the sponsors of the games and the tv people a clear message: boycott is in order. I am not watching these games - not for one minute - and will not buy any products from companies sponsoring them. The IOC is simply trying to make money off of the athletes during a time of international calamity. It’s truly sickening. Do you guys think of anything else except $$? Seriously, you really have no morals."
2021-07-08 16:49,"They should just cancel.  Besides the Covid pandemic, the controversy over drug use, and overt political manipulation, does anyone else feel creepy watching pubescent girls prove they are the best in the world at walking on a narrow beam with the knowledge that they lost their childhood and spent their entire life mastering a discipline that has no lasting value."
2021-07-08 16:50,Guessing Los Angeles is seriously reconsidering that $5.3billion commitment for the 2028 Olympics.
2021-07-08 16:46,Time to cancel the Olympics. The evil the Olympics does outweighs the good.  What was once a diversion for the idle rich has become a commercial spectacle.  It is as apolitical as Republican National Committee.  For most it is just another stop on the world tour of whatever sport is involved.
2021-07-08 17:18,"I hope, as all of us do, that Covid-19 is on the wane, but I have this uneasy feeling that this Delta variant, and other variants, one said to be able to infect even the fully vaccinated, may soon scare the heck out of all of humanity.

Fully vaccinated, so for a few days I stopped wearing the mask, noticing that many were doing the same, but now I'm back to wearing it, as are many I encounter.

I think we all need to be very cautious, be aware of our surroundings, and wear the mask all of the time when out and about, and whenever in any gathering that is not immediately family.

We still do not know what this virus may become ..."
2021-07-08 17:36,"A lot of these comments show a complete lack of understanding of the situation. There will be no audience. That means there will be no people exposed to one another. The athletes are restricted to their own housing and dining facilities. They will use train at different times so they are not in venues when other teams are.  The only time they are with other athletes is when they are competing, and many sports don't require athletes to be in close proximity, or are held outdoors. There have been world championships held recently that have observed the same protocols and no covid breakouts have been reported. 

Lots of comments about greed and money being the driving force, but that's not true for the athletes. Most of them have been preparing since they were children. It's easy for people to say the Olympics don't matter, but to the athletes it matters very much. Everything isn't reduced to money for everyone."
2021-07-08 17:47,"The Olympics is pushing the window for a mini pandemic in Tokyo. This is a tough position to be in. So, there will be no in-person spectators. Ok. The Olympics have always been a ‘for TV’ spectacle."
2021-07-08 17:52,"The Olympics should have been cancelled and might have been if not for those who control the Olympic committee and refused to call it off.  Already Japan has lost billions building facilities that assumed spectators.   What some commentators do not understand is that athletes from a couple of countries have already arrived and tested positive for the Delta form of the virus.  It is now in Japan.  As much as one might hope that housing the athletes separately and not permitting them out of their bubbles except to compete will keep the virus from spreading.  It will slow the spread but cannot stop it.The virus is not visible, it spreads despite good intentions.  It has spread already- too few inhabitants have been vaccinated.  That is on the Japanese government's very  slow rollout of vaccinations and it is also due to the fact that one cannot ""contain"" the virus - it spread from the cruise ships kept  in the harbors over a year ago - it does not glow in the dark, it is not visible.  The best one can hope for is for a slow spread and a speed up in vaccinating everyone in Japan.  The government's goal is to vaccinate as many as possible by November.   That is too slow and even now they cannot vaccinate all who want to be vaccinated as they lack sufficient vaccine."
2021-07-08 18:01,"The desire to have the pandemic over has led many to imagine that’s the case. And despite the nature of surges we’ve seen when restrictions are loosened, people continue to do so. It happened in Tokyo. Here, many universities have said they’ll be completely in person in the fall, as another example. With 18 to 25 year olds least vaccinated and least likely to get one. We’ll see what happens in August. We could’ve overcome this lethal illness like polio, but stubbornness and folly abound."
2021-07-08 17:04,"The Olympics closed to fans is like the Met closed to the public, SwanLake, the Nutcracker, Beethoven’s Fifth, the Marriage of Figgaro, Hamlet and Macbeth and Hamilton all performed in empty halls. And not just any performances.  Command performances, each five years in the making. 

It better be worth it."

2021-07-08 17:26,Who was surprised by this? Covid and it's variants have not gone away. I think we're in the eye of the hurricane when it comes to Covid.
2021-07-08 17:07,"So, with the pandemic in Japan expanding, the IOC and various national leaders plan to send thousands of athletes into the heart of the viral surge. One could suppose that wishful thinking is leading to the decisions to risk creating a massive super spreader event. The sad truth is that money is driving the risk-taking. In our time, money is God and our leaders worship accordingly."
2021-07-08 17:19,The Japanese government can improve the safety of the games even further by barring the athletes.
2021-07-08 17:20,"Japan’s COVID current case rate is just 1.5 per 100,000, one of the lowest in the world and lower than nearly every U.S. state. Even allowing for the limited level of vaccination (about 15%) the “spike in cases” comes off of an exceedingly low base."
2021-07-08 17:22,"When I think about Japan and its government mindset, I think of Fukishima. 
The arrogance of building a reactor next to the ocean on earthquake prone land comes to mind. Same kind of arrogance stated that this Olympics is going to be fortitude in the face of adversity. Charming. 
While we castigate politicos around the world, Modi Trump Bolasannaro etc, for their super spreader events which directly caused massive loss of life, here we have the Japanese government's issue with national pride that these Olymoics go on no matter what. 
There have been no lessons learned."
2021-07-08 17:27,"I think it's time that the Tokyo Organizers admit that they gave it their best shot and let the Government and Insurance Companies work out what gets paid to whom.  

No shame in that."
2021-07-08 17:39,"something I read elsewhere mentions that one reason Japn is so behind on vacs is that there is a law that prohibits anyone but doctors to administer the vaccine. 

I would have thought they would suspend that law!"
2021-07-08 17:02,"Well, if they're banning spectators why not go ahead and ban the athletes?  Then there wouldn't be any risk of infection for anyone."
2021-07-08 17:03,"The total failure of the Japanese government in managing the COVID pandemic and, by extension the Olympics, couldn't have been more complete.  Japan's response to COVID is much closer to India and Brazil than the US or Europe or even China.  So instead of showcasing the country to the world and celebrating our surviving this plague, the total lack of spectators will instead illustrate what happens when sclerotic politicians try to manage a country in the 21st Century but that still thinks like a feudal society.  What a wasted opportunity and how sad for the Japanese public to miss out on enjoying this once in a lifetime event."
2021-07-08 17:12,It's clear what is going on with this decision. The IOC will not let anything -- even a pandemic and resulting sickness and possible death -- get in he way of the piles of money they will rank in from the broadcast rights to the games. Follow the money.
2021-07-08 17:33,"My concern is for the athletes. I don’t think that Japan’s, “fortitude in the face of adversity”, can protect the participants. In fact that statement sounds both naive and self-serving."
2021-07-08 18:44,"Japan and other Asian nations have seen far fewer cases and deaths during the course of the pandemic mainly bc they have used a far more reasonable cycle threshold of 35 for PCR testing, compared to 40-45 for US and EU and other anglophone countries. They also haven’t done as much screening and surveillance of asymptomatics, which when done broadly is a well known source of large amounts of false positives due to basic Bayesian logic."
2021-07-08 16:48,Japan and the IOC really should postpone to next summer. Even without spectators there's still the risk to the athletes and the Japanese public that has pitifully low vaccination rates. At this point only greed and pride are keeping the games on (and a good dose of stupidity).
2021-07-08 17:00,This thing should have be cancelled --stupidity
2021-07-08 17:47,"Why are they even bothering, other than to generate millions in TV commercials during the games?  The Olympics have become totally meaningless since they let in professional athletes and especially professional sports teams--not to mention Beach Blanket Bikini Volleyball.

They exist for two things:  commercials and payoffs by cities to Olympic officials to host the games."
2021-07-08 18:17,Sometimes you can want something too much.  This is one of those times.
2021-07-08 18:14,"The Japanese have been obstinate in their unwillingness to cancel the Olympics despite persistent calls for them to do so. Now with Covid unchecked there it's become  a mockery of the Olympic ideal of global cooperation and unity. Instead, it poses a serious health hazard to all the athletes some of whom have already contracted the coronavirus. After the fiasco here in banning athletes who ate a pork burrito or like Naomi Osaka were dealing with major emotional distress and smoked legally available marijuana, the U.S. should withdraw from the Olympics. All the U.S. Olympic committee will be doing is endangering the lives of young athletes and add to the mockery they've already made of the trials and selection process."
2021-07-08 18:06,"Covid has dealt Tokyo a cruel hand. The IOC should award Tokyo the 2024 Summer Olympics, pushing Paris to 2028 and Los Angeles to 2032. Given the extraordinary, unforeseen circumstances of the past year and a half, what would be wrong with Tokyo hosting the summer games twice in a row?"
2021-07-08 18:13,"Most events happen outdoors. In the UK they are holding the Euro football championmships with 60,000 spectators. Everyone is required to have been vaccinated in order to attend. They have been holding similar events for the last month or so and there is no evidence of any event becoming a super spreader. They could do the same in Tokyo, at least for outdoor events. The risk of transmission outdoors is extremely low. For indoor events, ban all spectators if you must. It is ironic, howver, that the japanese who say they should ban spectators still eat indoors at restaurants."
2021-07-08 18:59,Those critical of this decision should first ask what we would do under similar circumstances?
2021-07-08 19:17,"I completely understand and appreciate the drive to hold this event, but clearly circumstances have changed and needs to be reconsidered.  To not even mandate that athletes and all associated must be vaccinated seems ludicrous.  This will be a stain on the IOC, the Olympic movement and Japan's government.

The Olympics need to be reimagined.  For example, many have suggested permanent, yet singular, sites for the winter and summer games.  Why does it have to be one site?  The only events that actually happen where everyone comes together are they opening and closing ceremonies. True, it's awesome to attend and be in the atmosphere (Whistler B.C. was amazing during the 2010 games), but the reality is that each sport has a separate venue, and if the idea is for the entire world to participate, why couldn't we have alpine skiing in France and nordic skiing in Utah?  Olympic-level competitions are already held for each of these sports.  I'm sure there are creative ways to package the overall event and the opening and closing ceremonies and create that warm fuzzy feeling of unity.  It would be much more affordable for an area to simply have to bid for figure skating than every single event."
2021-07-08 19:11,I barred myself from watching the Olympics on TV.
2021-07-08 18:57,"How many signs do organizers need to not have the Olympics this year?
Regardless of the outcome, Pride has won the Gold Medal and Rational Thinking didn't make the finals."
2021-07-08 17:18,Well I guess the athletes won't have a problem hearing the starting gun.
2021-07-08 18:48,IOC only cares about revenue- they feign concern for athletes.  I will not watch any of the coverage.  So for all the advertising dollars big corporations are spending I doubt ROI will not be realized.
2021-07-08 19:08,"The Olympics should have been cancelled.  

However, BIG money would not allow it because they want the television royalties.  Then, because of COVID 19, they will write the whole thing off as a ""loss"" to evade even more taxes.

ProPublica.org has pubished it's latest investigation into how the top 0.01% and their 9.0% operatives cheat to avoid paying their equitable share of taxes.  It's a must read for anyone who knows how the wealthiest are destroying OUR democracy with their greed.

I have often compared professional sports - and any sport played for ""investor/owner profit"" - to the lions, christians and gladiators of Roman times where the wealthiest were ""entertained"" - and enriched - by watching peons and slaves kill each other.  Some have said the athletes are ""well-paid"" slaves.  Read the ProPublica.org articles to see the preposterous difference between owner/player taxes.  It will blow your mind.

WE THE PEOPLE must DEMAND changes to OUR IRS rules to prevent the wealthiest from avoiding taxes while they steal from the rest of us.  
 
NOW is the time,  before they can further destroy fairness and democracy in OUR USA."
2021-07-08 19:24,"The Olympics are a  ridiculous waste of money. Tokyo bet and lost! We still have a pandemic, there are no guarantees. Best to postpone. 

Also, instead of spending millions every four years on new venues, how about a dedicated winter and summer locations, so there’s no waste of money and it’s more sustainable?!"
2021-07-08 19:40,"The Olympics are not likely to be a super-spreader event if the organizers do things smartly. Removing spectators gets rid of much of the risk.

The Tokyo (population 14 million) case count of about 1,000 is roughly the same as what we are seeing here in Washington state--400 cases for a population of 8 million. 

The United States is still not doing the testing that other countries, including Japan, are doing, and so our case counts are almost certainly significant undercounts.  

Whether or not you agree with the wisdom of it, Washington state is mostly reopened already or nearly there. The case rate among our unvaccinated people is still as high as our statewide February spike. 

The Japanese health authorities (who are pro science), the local organizers and the Olympic people will presumably respond to and address the pertinent facts as supported by the latest research, including:

27% of the Japanese have had one shot and 15% are fully vaccinated. One shot alone is probably not very good vis-a-vis the Delta variant. Vaccinated people are becoming infected with the variant (but without severe disease) and are transmitting it. The variant is probably more transmissible and more severe."
2021-07-08 20:06,"Does anyone else anticipate that the US will have to resume actions like social distancing, wearing face masks, and cancelling events? 

Because I do, and it makes me very depressed. 

And, to the Trump supporters: no. I am not 'virtue signaling"". I'm just being realistic, and considering what the future might hold. What we *might* have in common, is the belief that stocking up on food and supplies is a good idea, before another round of supply chain issues and shortages. I just won't go overboard."
2021-07-08 20:11,"I was hoping they would postpone to 2022, the year of the winter Olympics.  In the past, the winter and summer games were held in the same year which was fine.   As a ticket and package buyer, the experience has been discouraging.  A once in a lifetime dream turned into a nightmare.  The ticket broker is retaining 25 % of the price of all packages and 20% of all tickets payments. Has ruined my Olympic spirit."
2021-07-08 19:22,Just cancel it already.
2021-07-08 19:56,"What if you threw the biggest party in the world, but no one attended?  

At this point I’m torn between feeling very sorry for the Japanese people and very angry at the Japanese government for its epic failure to get its people vaccinated."

2021-07-08 19:51,"It seems that the IOC only care about the financial ramifications of calling off or postponing the Olympics. A James Bond could be made about an evil person using the Olympics to spread a deadly virus around the world.

2021-07-08 18:37,Imagine if Japan was actually testing its population as rigorously as the rest of the world. The numbers would be astronomically higher.
2021-07-08 18:01,"Attitudes about the Olympics are changing, and have been since Sochi. The Olympics have always been about corruption, power, and money - not sports. What is the difference between the Olympics, and the world championships in (insert sport here) - nothing. The world is going to remember what happened in Sochi, in Rio, in Tokyo, and next year in Beijing. They will remember the human rights violations, the IOC demands for the most expensive accommodations for themselves, and the absolute selfishness/indifference to human life - not to mention a complete lack of attention to social justice issues by the rich white folks in power. The time of the Olympics, and the relevance of such, is running out."

2021-07-08 15:38,"Vitamin D, Ivermectin and an international travel policy that focused more on health than on political correctness could have both dramatically limited the spread of the Delta variant and even now could limit the seriousness of the illness.

Journalists and health officials might save lives by investigating this."

""overcoming hardship""?
Japan doesn't overcome anything yet.
""effort and wisdom""?
Japan's oppressive Suga government has no also effort and no also wisdom.

They only repeat mistimed State of Emergency, then mere rely on late vaccination.

Main infection measures of Japan only depend on individual efforts of citizen or self-sacrifice of medical workers because government is incompetence.
Moreover, government doesn't enough assistance to general citizen and medical organization who have been exhausted mentally and economically.

Japan's healthcare system fall into overload whenever incompetent government repeats Covid-19 epidemic wave with optimistic politics, and victim had increased.

Japan where cannot yet expand even PCR test doesn't yet solve many problem about infection healthcare.

Holding Olympics with ignoring many opposition will bring new crisis to healthcare system and society of Japan with high probability.

2021-07-08 21:19,"The Japanese, being a proud, discipled people, will forge ahead and do their best to hold the Olympics as promised but it seems a big mistake for everyone involved, especially the athletes.  The IOC should postpone or cancel now, perhaps allow another six months if that's possible. Or do the right thing and just consider compensating Japan for some of the expense and guarantee that they will host the next Olympics scheduled. I know a lot of years go by between Olympic events but could this be rescheduled for next year?  I assume this is summer Olympics so January would not work, I guess, for the buildings and venues already built.  All this is sad but not nearly as if athletes were to get sick with Covid in the midst of competitions. I agree with whoever said it should have been cancelled already. This seems like a really bad idea."
2021-07-08 11:46,Athletes must prove they have been vaccinated in order to participate and the same for spectators attending the events.  Spectators also must wear masks.  Let the games begin.
2021-07-08 15:07,"If I were a citizen or permanent resident of Japan, I would never want the Japanese government to ever again submit a bid to host the Olympics. If there are many Japanese citizens who feel this way, it represents a massive sea change in attitude. Few people over the decades have been more enthusiastic about the Olympics than the people of Japan. 

The leaders of Japan were among the first to understand how being able to successfully host a major international sporting event could display a country's competence and ""advanced"" status to the rest of the world. This is why Japan successfully bid in 1936 to have Tokyo host the 1940 Summer games. Those were cancelled due to Japan's own aggression and warfare, but their leaders didn't forget and in the postwar years a peaceful, militarily emasculated Japan hosted the summer games once (1964) and winter games twice (1972 and 1998). 

Other ""developing"" or ""emerging market"" countries took their cue from Japan, the first country outside of Europe, Australia, or the U.S. to host either the summer or winter games. It was a big deal when a Latin American country (Mexico) first hosted the '68 summer games. For citizens of South Korea and China, Seoul 1988 and Beijing 2008 showed that they could pull off what rival Japan had done earlier. 

All this positive meaning invested in hosting the Olympics is now completely gone. It's just seen as an invitation to getting ripped off by the International Olympic Committee. Who wants that?"
2021-07-08 20:54,"One thing that seems to be lost in stories about spectators at the Olympics in Japan is that the country's ""spike"" in cases still is nothing compared to the number of coronavirus cases in the United States. 

The US is currently averaging 4.6 cases per 100,000 people according to The New York Times.

Japan is currently averaging 1.3 cases per 100,000 people.

In response, there are no spectators at sporting events in Japan. So why isn't it the same here? We have far more cases here and yet sports stadiums are at full capacity with people not wearing masks. Why? 

This is insane. The deadly Delta Variant is running rampant throughout the US and much of the world. We could learn a lot from countries like Japan. Wish we were taking similar precautions here in the US."
2021-07-08 21:55,"The Olympics are so much fun to watch. I’m surprised that Japan, knowing the Olympics were on the horizon, has only managed to vaccinate 15 percent of its people. They wouldn’t have to cancel if they’d really worked at vaccines, and maybe employed some of that famous Japanese engineering to reconfigure stadiums. Instead of excitement, the Japanese seem so dour and grumpy. 
    It seems such a far cry from Japan’s  economic engine that produced such incredible growth in the country’s GDP in the 1980’s and 1990’s. I’ve heard that the Japanese government has become sclerotic, dominated by very old officials. But how the Japanese have handled the Tokyo Olympics in the Covid era drives that message home. 
    Is this marvelous, well-designed, beautifully engineered country now beset by decay and the decrepitude of its aging population?"
2021-07-08 21:24,Should just cancel it. Get ready for 2024!!!
2021-07-08 21:32,With all our  millions of GOOP cry babies saying  i don’t want to be vaccinated or wear a mask why would any person in their right mind want to attend this usually crowded event or even any event in the United States.  They have a death wish and better them than me.  LOL
2021-07-08 22:09,"I am incredulous at the flow of dyspeptic, sour comments here. I love the Olympics, and I can’t wait to see all the athletes who’ve spent years training and peaking for these Olympics. I think Japanese paralysis is profoundly disappointing to the world. Sure, Covid presents big challenges. But as Euro2020 has demonstrated, these are solvable problems. I feel Japan just curled up in a ball and gave up. They showed no drive and determination to safely put on this event, as they had promised to do."

2021-07-08 22:27,"What a bunch of ninnies we’ve become. 

Take appropriate, science based precautions to prevent spread - vaccines, masks, distancing, outdoor vs indoor gathering. Limit crowds. Then get on with life.

We will be living with SARS-Cov2 for a long time.  We can’t play possum forever."
2021-07-08 22:11,"It might be that Japan _has_ to have the Olympics in order to recover the huge costs of setting it up. I don't know how much a ticket is, but I'd guess that the TV-rights really bring home the bacon. Therefor cancelling the Olympics is not an option, money-wise, even if it unfolds before empty ranks. 

Still, I predict a huge loss for the city of Tokyo, and very disappointed athletes. It's just not the same without spectators. They're what makes it a spectacle, literally :-) 

But better save than sorry, and seeing what BoJo is doing in England with the Euro 2020 final amidst a huge surge in Delta infections one can only say ""Kudos"" to the organizers of the Olympics. Surely not a popular decision, but a necessary one!"

2021-07-08 22:30,"With care, Japan could manage Covid risks and put on a successful Olympics for all the world to enjoy. 
   Last fall, I knocked thousands of Democratic doors in North Carolina. I was careful: At a time when Dems prohibited door knocking (probably losing the state in the process) I campaigned outside, wore a mask and gloves, stood 6 feet back from the door. I talked to thousands of people of every background. When I cured ballots, they could track my routes by the incoming votes. I did NOT get Covid. Come on folks. Use some common sense! These Olympics can run successfully, if people would not be such negative drips."
2021-07-08 22:30,"Over a year and a half into this pandemic with variants abounding and low vaccinations, that the Olympics were even considered magnifies the failure to grasp the recurring severity of this virus.  4,000,000 dead worldwide."
2021-07-08 22:42,"It is unbearable for me to watch humans killing themselves in the name of sports.  Likewise, I skip ice skate competitions.

2021-07-08 23:06,"Sadly, this decision, too long in coming, is the right thing to do.  At least it is given Japan's insistence on still staging the delayed 2020 Olympics.

And it can be said that the reality is that for many events, the absence of spectators will be minimal.  Outside of a relatively few, many Olympic events draw low attendance numbers due to the sport's obscurity and limited interest.

But the absence of crowds at both the Opening and Closing Ceremonies will be eerie.  As will those few team-oriented events where spectators from various countries cheer their national teams.

Alas, not ""USA, USA"" chants this year.

On one level one has to feel sorry for the Japanese.  They've obviously spent a fortune on new and improved venues to hold the Olympic.  Venues, ironically, that were constructed in part to accommodate spectators.

And think too of all the hotels that were built, enlarged, renovated etc. to accommodate expected visitors.

Nonetheless, one is left to wonder why these Games are being held at all?

Even holding the Games in the light of Covid seems almost bizarre.  And Japan has not managed its response to Covid well at all.

It's probably too late, and too ""loss of face"" for Japan to just toss it all aside.  But these Games will always be ""exceptional"" -- and not in a good way."

The comments by IOC officials have plucked Japanese nerves one after another, including ""the Tokyo games will still proceed even if Tokyo remains in a state of emergency"" and ""Barring Armageddon that we can't see or anticipate, these things are a go."" The IOC, NBC Universal, and other stakeholders want to hold the Game in any circumstances, in a hot, very muggy season, from money-making standpoints.

IOC chairman, who postponed his visit due to the pandemic, finally arrived in Japan yesterday.  He plans to visit Hiroshima, the world's first city that suffered from nuke-Armageddon and the vice-chairman plans to Nagasaki under the state of emergency.  What a blatant performance they do!"

For him holding them on schedule postponed is a stark appearance of allegiance to his predecessor, Mr. Abe. Mr.Abe is a God in the rulling party with record on the longest term of presiding over Japan and was the head of seizing a right to  postponement of 2020 Olympic games from IOC in those days hoped their cancellation.

I remember going to Salt Lake City Winter Olympics as a kid, and the experience of seeing people from almost every nation on earth was incredible. Seeing them play sports at a ridiculously high level was awe-inspiring. The olympics are an important part of my life and memories, and there are millions of people like me and billions of people who watch and enjoy the olympics. In regards to the pandemic, having no spectators will definitely make it more safe, but the games should go on. We have been playing sports all year like that and it has worked fine. The olympics is highly regulated, these people are tested regularly. It will be safe and a wonderful experience after a difficult year."

2021-07-15 13:45,"Humanity needs for the economy to slow down.

It's impossible to even respect their approach, at this point."
2021-07-15 13:58,"""China reported on Thursday that its economy grew 7.9 percent from April through June, compared to the same period last year, falling short of estimates. Although that pace is still stronger than in many other countries, it is markedly slower than the 18.3 percent leap the economy made in the first three months of the year as it bounced back from lockdowns a year earlier.""
These numbers look normal to me. China was in lockdown from late January to early April 2020. But it was back to normal from April to June 2020. So the year-to-year growth for the April-June period at 7.9% is actually quite impressive, while the 18.3% growth for the January to March period was just an anomaly."
2021-07-15 14:01,"Slowing from 18.3% to 7.9% is not exactly the doldrums implied by the headline and lede. We would be thrilled to have more than one quarter of growth above 6%. So, why act as if China's economy is not roaring along? I would expect growth to continue at that rate or higher as other countries emerge from the pandemic and demand for Chinese products increases."

That is what happened when the Covid-19 virus first was detected  in Wuhan and that is what happens with economic data."
2021-07-15 14:45,"The widely wished for bounce back is based on delusional thinking. Of course economic activity is ramping up and the rate of growth is magnified by the doldrums the economy has inhabited during the pandemic. Businesses are looking for quick profits to make up for heavy losses. Many businesses will never reopen. There is a lot of catching up to do.

However, although savings have increased at the top end of the income spectrum, they have dropped for most of the rest of us. Many have been tided over with the stimulus packages which are being phased out, but overall income has been depressed for the past year while debt has been increasing for most. The loss of 600,000 Americans will have a great impact. Whole industries such as nursing homes, tourism and travel will not be the same. Local governments are bankrupt. Schools are in trouble. Health care has taken a devastating hit. 

It is so premature to worry about inflation."
2021-07-15 15:16,"With supply chains broken and the requirements for resources that have become scarce as a result, China cannot assume their manufacturing based export economy will return to the engine it was. This apparent new reliance on their own consumers and small business to replace that engine of growth may be misplaced. The more manufacturing suffers, the smaller the bank accounts of workers get and the less consumerism will flourish in a land that has such a recent history of want.

Perhaps, China will need to curb their pursuit of nationalism and international power to weather this new supply and inflation paradigm that the pandemic has thrust upon them. The Chinese consumer will not take the place of the American consumer as the engine of main engine of growth in their economy during this accelerated period of economic change. 

Cooperation is indicated or continued growth may be smothered by a cautious populace before supply chains and tourism return to normal, if they ever do."
2021-07-15 15:48,"I am surprised that this NYT report is misleading and biased-selected, this doesn't help us to know more about China.

First, as some people have already pointed out:  GDP changing from 18.3% (Q1 2021) to 7.9% (Q2 2021) does not exactly mean the slowing of economic growth. 

Second, this report argued increase in retail sales could have been partly the result of rising prices of 5.3% in Q2 and cited the number from CEIC data. But the CPI announced by the China government is actually -0.3~1.1 in the past six months. The inflation is partly reduced by the RMB appreciation.

The author also talked about accumulated mountain of debt. OK, but where is the number? And if China should be afraid of increasing debt, what are we America doing right now?

What we should be really care in China's government quarterly report are: first, the huge increase of the product price when leaving the factory is around 6.8~8.8% in Q2. If we compare that to the small change of their domestic CPI, we should concern how this will impact the inflation here in America in the next few months since we import a lot of goods from China.

Second, the huge Q2 increase in production of green car, industrial robotics, IC, and green energy generation are 205%, 70%, 48%, and 13.4%, respectively. The Q2 investment in high-tech industry increases 23.5%. The economic recovery is indeed unbalanced, but these data imply the fast transformation to high-tech industry in China.

Give us a complete report."
2021-07-15 15:56,"It’s becoming abundantly clear that the United States needs China’s export machine to control our inflation, and China needs our raw materials to grow its economy. This reality has been decades in the making, and we decouple it at this most vulnerable time at our own peril. When you have countries as big and complex as these two, there will never be simple truths and pristine realities. We should remind ourselves that strengthening the bilateral economic relationship now does not undermine revisiting the relationship in the future. For the sake of the global economy, these two economic superpowers should cooperate until we are on the other side of the COVID-19 Crisis."
2021-07-15 16:06,"Gordon G. Chang, an American lawyer, predicted in the year 2001 the following scenario in his book The Coming Collapse of China “The end of the modern Chinese state is near. The People's Republic has five years, perhaps ten, before it falls.” 

NYT too published a commentary on Chang’s book <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2001/09/09/books/reckoning-with-china.html"" target=""_blank"">https://www.nytimes.com/2001/09/09/books/reckoning-with-china.html</a>

The prediction did not materialize as the dooms day pundits have failed realize that “Deng Xiaoping was quite clear that the reason economic take off was so important was to enable China to be strong. It was not just economic; it clearly had very powerful political motivation as well.”  Martin Jacques.

It will extremely fool hardy to ignore the remarkable economic transformation China has undergone in decades under Deng Xiaoping’s reforms opening China to the world in 1978.  
 
CPC not only survived the process, but thrived as the driving force behind market reforms that turned a country reeling in the aftermath of the “cultural revolution” into the second largest economy in the world. This undoubtedly is a remarkable feat of adaptability."
2021-07-15 23:21,"Keith Bradsher wrote: ""If China's economy further slows, it could drag down the rest of the global economy. Many countries now depend on Chinese factories and consumers.""

So, it's up to China to calibrate how much economic slowdown is acceptable if dragging down the rest of the global economy could be advantageous. As long as its economy is still growing, why not?

Chinese manufacturers should definitely pass along the increase in material supply costs to its customers. Makes no sense to absorb the inflation if the customers are eager to buy. Reship the inflation back out and share it with the world."
2021-07-12 22:33,"Thank you to the writers of this piece, and for their continued augmenting and updating today.

I have a question / request: could you possibly look a bit deeper into vaccine-induced G-B, either as part of the J&J situation, or on its own, and add any studies or references about developing a dangerous sensitivity to any & all vaccines, even those previously well-tolerated, after a bout with G-B from a vaccine?

And, what, if any therapies are available? The article says most people recover; more on that would be of interest.

I ask this as a wife to husband who was seriously affected by G-B a dozen years ago, after getting the original Shingles (live vaccine) shot. Six months of progress in his recovery -- which was supportive care only: stockings, staying hydrated, avoiding heat extremes, etc., -- was then completely undone in the Fall of that year, after getting routine flu vaccination. 

After that, he was advised not to get ANY vaccines, ever. So we live in a fraught and distressing situation re: CoVid vaxx. He'd love one -- but the downside risk -- 2+ years of recovery based on past experience ... that's not a great choice. 

We continue to query his doctors and ask if any work-arounds or suggestions. No one wants to say 'go for it,'; instead, it's 'continue to follow CoVid protocols as if a vaccine doesn't exist, and hope for some backstop like anti-virals to have at home,' etc., etc. 

Anyway, the whole G-B issue & vaccines is of interest. Thank you for your time."
2021-07-12 22:38,"""Federal officials have identified 100 suspected cases of Guillain-Barré disease among recipients of the one-dose shot.  About 12.8 million people — or about eight percent of the fully vaccinated population in the United States — have received the Johnson & Johnson shot.""

During the same period, 200 people who received the Johnson & Johnson shot were run over by a bus."

2021-07-12 22:51,"Guillain-Barre syndrome is rare, usually mild, and is nicely treatable (with IVIG or plasma exchange); death is exceedingly rare..... Death from COVID is far less rare. Choose for yourself! I personally took the COVID vaccine in December 2020/ Jan 2021 and have been loving life ever since ( other than a transient sore arm and headache after each dose .)"
2021-07-12 22:46,"100 cases among 12,800,000 recipients since it was authorized on Feb 27th (about four months). So that means an incidence of (very roughly) 2.5 in 100,000 per year, compared with between 0.4 and 1.7 in 100,000 in the general population. Average those and you get about 1.05, right? So your risk of getting it because of the vaccine (I.e., you would not have otherwise) is about 1.45 in 100,000. Basically 1 in 70,000. Seriously fretting over that? Watch out for lightning bolts and copperhead snakes, then."

The Russian Sputnik vaccine is a two-shot regime giving the immune system a one-two punch with two different human adenovirus vectors, but most 'two-shot' vaccines simply involve a second shot of the same antigen a few weeks after the immune system is primed with a first shot.

One shot of Pfizer is probably as good as one shot of J&J, and a booster shot of J&J after a few weeks probably provides additional protection - though the best protection seems to come from mixing shots, on the Russian model.

Here J&J is popular among kids, many of whom are keen to shorten the period between first shot and partying (with quite a few disregarding the official two-week delay).

But again, can someone please explain what makes one shot of J&J enough, while  Pfizer, Moderna, Astrazeneca and other programs specify a primer and booster?"

How many products now have there been where after being on the market for years does the general public find out about the certain “attachments”? Sunscreen, sweeteners, ibuprofen, BPA’s, the list goes on. 

What’s the point of having such an agency, when they can just add these “attachments” whenever they find out that oops.. sorry... our bad... this causes cancer, or some nerve disorder.

2021-07-12 23:07,"Guillain-Barré syndrome was a significant complication of the 1976 Swine Flu vaccine. A massive vaccination program was rolled out after a soldier at Ft. Dix died of Swine Flu. 13 patients were eventually hospitalized with Swine Flu, no additional deaths, but 450 people contracted Guillain-Barré syndrome from the vaccine. It was a scandal that may have cost Gerald Ford the election. The feared Swine Flu epidemic did not appear here or elsewhere where vaccination was uncommon."

The fact is GBS has been around for decades and it’s associated with every vaccine ever in extremely low amounts so why now, during a global pandemic, do you put it on the front page.

2021-07-12 23:20,"I would just add to my early, previous post: my husband's serious G-B from 'live' shingles shot in Spring 2009 (plus possibly getting a pneumonia vaccine at / around the same time) absolutely followed the 3-week to significant symptom presentation as mentioned in this piece. 
At that point, it was impossible to ignore. 

But there were earlier warning signs that something was amiss and even with inquiries to his physician before the 'big emergency, Dr. just brushed them off. 

And even when significant symptoms took us to E.R., via ambulance on very scary Sat. night, doctors (hospitalists) there also ignored possibility of G-B and we were sent home. 
It took 3-4 months, different hospitals, several specialists and a lot of tests (with more than one blind alley) -- to get to the crux of the matter. 

By then, the damage was indeed far along and done, and recovery was long. I'm just grateful he had taken an early retirement by then, as this would have ended his work career on its own.

So while most G-B cases may be mild ... either his wasn't, or it just was so all-encompassing, it created a lot of obstacles for years to come. 

Thus --  if you feel even a bit off in the week or two following any vaccine, press for more investigation of G-B. 
Had we known then what we know now, maybe could have staved off some of the worst. 

And by the way, in no way are we anti-vaxxers. Quite the opposite. Just have to be smart about it, or press the pros to be smarter for you."

I was incredibly lucky: after three months in rehab I worked my way back to a full recovery. I’ve never taken one moment of good health for granted in the 35 years since then. 
My parting advice from my neurologist way back then was if possible to avoid stimulating my immune system. Pragmatically, what that worked out to was: no flu shots. So, every year, I don’t get one (and I occasionally get the flu).
When the Covid vaccines became available I had a long talk with my primary care physician. At age 70, I wanted no part of Covid, but I had been lucky with my first experience with GBS and didn’t want to risk a second bout. Back in January, she and I looked at the three vaccines and decided that J&J operated too much like a flu shot: as we understood it, J&J stimulates the immune system to provide its protection. Pfizer and Moderna provide their protection in a completely new and unprecedented way. So she and I agreed to one of these new double-dose vaccines. 
When my health care system offered Moderna I was all in. First dose In February; second dose in March; no side effects; no GBS. 
J&J is as safe as a flu shot. 100 cases of GBS out of 13 million vaccinations. For the general population, the J&J odds are in your favor. For the GBS community, no."
2021-07-13 0:37,"Between the demonstrated inefficacy of the JJ vaccine, and now these severe risks, it would seem like the prudent move would be to simple take it out of circulation and boost production of the remaining vaccines which are demonstrably more effective and less risky.

But undoubtedly the government will put the profits of JJ before the health and safety of the public."
2021-07-13 0:25,"3,000 to 5,000 cases of this disease out of 300,000,000 a year in U.S.
So 100 out of 13,000,000 get it and it's a problem? 
Normal person gets it: 100,000 to 1 shot.
Vaccinated get it: 130,000 to 1 shot.
What's the problem? And why make it more difficult to get everyone vaccinated with this non-event."
2021-07-13 0:58,"I think that the real problem is that a significant number of U.S. residents are not buying into vaccination. While the CDC has a duty to make this information public, it will fuel opposition to vaccination. Biden's recent statements don't help either. Just before Independence Day, he celebrated ""independence"" from Covid-19. The day after the holiday, he did an about face and talked about the urgency of vaccination in light of Covid Delta. This kind of mixed messaging can only fuel skepticism.

The reality is that the U.S. vaccination program is not only not leading other countries, it's falling behind. One need only compare U.S. data with Canadian data next door. Canada's target is to fully vaccinate 75% of the population aged 12 and older:

U.S, 12 and older, at least one shot: 64.9%
Canada, 12 and older, at least one shot : 77.7%

U.S., 12 and older, fully vaccinated: 56.2%
Canada, 12 and older, fully vaccinated: 41.1%

The first set of numbers tell us that the U.S. has a buy-in problem. The second set reflects the fact that Canada doesn't make vaccines and has had a supply problem. Having recently resolved that issue, its fully vaccinated population is currently increasing at the rate of 1% a week. It expects to improve on that in the coming weeks.

As has been widely reported, the U.S. vaccination program is stalling. It looks to me that Canada will get to 75%, but at the moment 75% of the U.S. population looks very optimistic."
2021-07-13 1:00,"I came down with  Guillain-Barre Syndrome in 1976 after a swine flu shot. Therefore, I was very wary of getting a COVID-19 vaccination this year. After much research, I decided to go with the Johnson & Johnson vaccine and developed very few side effects that lasted less than a week. Why is the Johnson & Johnson vaccine being singled out? Why aren't similar warnings being published for the dangers of the other vaccines?"
2021-07-13 1:05,"All that a reasonable person can conclude is that Pfizer or Moderna leaned on the FDA to dis the J&J vaccine or some activist group applied pressure. Since the FDA has lost all credibility with them Aduhelm fiasco we know that its pronouncements are not scientifically based; they are based on politics, pressure from lobbying groups and big pharma, and PR. This is what happens when a supposedly apolitical, science-based organization turns out to be anything but. We simply CANNOT believe the FDA."
2021-07-13 1:30,"2 weeks after my second Pfizer vaccine I couldn't sleep, for 3 and a half weeks.I mean no sleep. I became delirious.Nothing helped.A friend who uses a medical cannabis dispensary,brought me a vial of CBD tincture,with a low THC percentage. I slept. I would have received the vaccine,even if I knew I would have this side effect.That said,there needs to be honesty about possible side effects. The neurological side effect I experienced was also experienced by a small percentage in the trials.Those anti-vaxers won't get it anyway. For the rest of us that want to protect ourselves,our loved ones and our community,please just be up front, about documented side effects.I am so very grateful for the vaccine!Yes I am now sleeping without any sleeping aids."
2021-07-13 1:07,I got the j&j vaccine side affect were sine chills and nausea but all else was good.  Just got back from Branson MO where they say the delta variant is 2weeks back and all good. I am glad with my choice of this vaccine
2021-07-13 0:44,I had the J&J vaccine in May.  J&J sells the shot at cost to the government for $10 a dose.  It's a fraction of the price of the other vaccines and J&J makes no profit on it.  It's by far the most cost effective way to stop Covid-19 and that's why I chose it.  No regrets.
2021-07-13 0:39,"Unlike some commenters here, I don't blame the media for reporting this. But I find it incredibly irritating how so many people have zero comprehension of relative risks. Does the fact that tens of thousands of Americans die in car wrecks every year stop people from driving? No. But for some reason some incredibly rare side effects from some of the vaccines make people fear vaccination when their chance of death from the virus is orders of magnitude higher. The risk of any person developing the severe side effects is lower than your chance of being struck by lightning. Roughly 1 and 550 Americans have died of the virus so far. Your chance of dying from a vaccination are orders of magnitude lower. It's absolutely ridiculous that people won't get vaccinated because they have no common sense when it comes to relative risks. It also shows that math education in this country is sadly lacking."

It's been 4-5 months since my family in the US was vaccinated. It will be at best another 4-5 months before Koreans and foreign residents of Korea are vaccinated. For the poorest countries, they may have to wait until 2023. If this news scares Americans off the jab, we'll be glad to take it off your hands."

2021-07-13 3:03,"I have been suffering from nerve pain for nearly four months after the J&J vaccine. Still haven't gotten a referral to a specialist. Many of us who have been injured by this vaccine are not being counted by the CDC because we lack the health care necessary to receive a diagnosis. I'm not an anti-vaxer by any means and I knew there were risks. But I didn't know I would be totally on my own if something did go wrong. At least now I know it is not just me. I suspect the CDC thinks it's mostly men suffering from this because when women (e.g. me) go to the doctor with complaints like this, it gets ignored. This is much bigger than is being reported."

A lot of excellent reporting by the Times lately.  Keep up the good work!"
2021-07-13 3:49,"After receiving a J&J shot early April, on Friday April 23, my lady felt uneasy and couldn't perform simple tasks. She felt tired and constantly laid down. I remember her sitting on the bed with her head down saying, ""I feel defeated."" I told her to keep her head up and just rest. She seemed disoriented. Throughout that week she lost her appetite. I even fed her that night with a spoon. She is 67 and never had any of these problems.

Anyway, the next morning she couldn't see well...she couldn't lift her right arm or hold onto a spoon or knife and I looked into her eyes and her eyes spoke but she didn't say much except she wanted a peanut butter sandwich. I then proceeded to call her daughter and we both took her to Presbyterian-Cornell Hospital on 68th St & what, 1st Ave? The doctors said it was a good thing we brought her in when we did. She had already felt a bit better because of eating that sandwich. She screezed my hand, as I had told her to, to see what strength she had. I stayed onto late into the night.

I left her in good care of those beautiful, patient doctors. Her daughter visited her on Sunday, as hospital policy was only minimal visitors. All day Sunday I had a talk with God...talking with him and crying like I've never cried before. I requested He allow us both to live a long life. All day I was in a frenzy. 

Monday doctors said Blood Clots/Mini-Stroke/Low Count Kidney. She is fine and well now. (NY Times messaging me my comment is too long)."
2021-07-13 2:51,Can’t this occur with any vaccine?
2021-07-13 4:24,"Let’s do the math:

10 out of a million is 1 in 100,000 (in the general population).

100 out of 12.8 million is 1 in 128,000 (among those vaccinated).

Not sure I’m following why there is a problem here unless the numbers given are wrong.  In any case, the real point is one has to adjust the 100 to allow for the not inconsiderable number of those who would have come down with G-B even without having taken the vaccine.

On the other hand order of magnitude about 1 out of every 100 die of COVID (of course a lot depends on age, preconditions, etc.)."
2021-07-13 5:24,"Reading many of the comments here, I better understand 'vaccine hesitancy', but still fail to understand why many hesitant people at very, very, very low risk of (generally manageable, if sometimes very inconvenient) side effects have so much more fear of the side effects of vaccines, than of the side effects (for themselves AND OTHERS) of Covid.

We are learning fairly quickly of groups at higher risk of certain very rare side effects of each vaccine as they are rolled out, and those at greater, though still minuscule, risk are offered alternative vaccines.

What is it about vaccines in general, compared to many other far more risky things in our inherently fragile lives, that makes many people exaggerate vaccine risk way out of proportion?

I really struggle to understand this."

2021-07-13 6:20,"As a GBS survivor, I asked my GP beforehand if the vaccines represented any risk for my health (in the past I was told to avoid the flu vaccine), and if I should avoid any one of them. I still have the impression I was not taken seriously, but anyway I got a Pfizer shot, and not J&J. I considered the risk real, although minimal.The problem with GBS is that we don't yet understand why it develops on some people, and not in some others. You can be perfectly healthy one day, and the next day you can't walk properly, or have difficulty to eat or breath. Having had GBS as a child, I wanted to be sure I would get a vaccine that was no way related to GBS."
2021-07-13 4:59,"I find it funny how so many commenters here dont even want to hear about side effects from these vaccines. I am kind of flabergasted by this view, which usually is accompanies by some kind of educationally elitist concept that people are too dumb to understand relative risk so we therefore shouldnt even tell them about side effects because they are too stupid to understand basic statistics. I think these elitists would be surprised at how intelligent most people actually are. Personally, Im an MIT-educated biologist. Im 33 and have already had covid. In my risk analysis, looking at actual data there is basically no benefit for a healthy young person with natural immunity to take a vaccine, and given the small chance (70/100k myocarditis for my age group and gender being the the largest side effect that is very serious, along with smaller chances of bloot clots, neurological disorders, and other side effects) of side effects I personally dont believe taking a vaccine is a smart idea. I believe that most Americans can do a risk analysis and decide for themselves, and we should let them do that by providing valuable information such as that provided in this article."

2021-07-13 10:47,"GBS is thought to result from an immune response to a preceding infection that cross-reacts with peripheral nerve components because of molecular mimicry. The immune response can be directed towards the myelin or the axon of peripheral nerve, resulting in demyelinating and axonal forms of GBS. (See ""Guillain-Barré syndrome: Pathogenesis"", section on 'Mechanisms'.)

Campylobacter jejuni infection (food poisoning from undercooked meats or seafood) is the most commonly identified precipitant of GBS. Cytomegalovirus, Epstein-Barr virus (mono), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), and Zika virus have also been associated with GBS. (See ""Guillain-Barré syndrome: Pathogenesis"", section on 'Antecedent events'.)

A small percentage of patients develop GBS after another triggering event such as immunization, surgery, trauma, and bone-marrow transplantation.
It is rare."
2021-07-13 13:35,I received the JJ vaccine on April 8th. I was sick in bed for 2 days with flu-like symptoms. My arm was sore for a week. By the end of April I thought all of that was behind me. Starting in May I developed very bad nerve and muscle pain in my vaccine arm that extended around to my right shoulder blade. I couldn't lift my arm beyond parallel to the ground. I'm still doing physical therapy that I started  in June. The pain is slowly going away for which I am grateful.

The public didn't seem to understand the totally different nature between J&J and the two-shot mRNA (Pfizer/Moderna) vaccines, the anti-vax liars increased their bluster, and the possibility of getting every person in the US over 2 years old vaxed fell apart.
First, it's time, at this point to bar use of J&J in the US and make create a big campaign that only good and safe vaccines are used in the US.
Second, it's time to bring in the FDA Inspector General for a crash analysis of how the J&J product was certified. Was this part of the opioid suit nonsense?
Either officials of the FDA or the J&J Corp. or both  need to go, if only to save lives by restoring faith in the mRNA products."

Up to 22% of people with Guillain-Barre syndrome need temporary help from a machine to breathe within the first week when they're hospitalized for treatment.

2021-07-13 15:13,"By going thru' the history of the single dose J&J vaccine, its trouble , mix up and  its vaccine became a pack of refuse at Baltimore plant, I could see a major faux pas in J&J's policy of going for a single shot vaccine when its competitors went for a two jab regime.
1) Commercial -Every single shot of J&J vaccine sold in the market is a loss to its competitor's earning from their two doses.
2) Technical- by adopting a two shot regimen of a priming dose followed by a booster shot, evaluation in field trial, approval by FDA& WHO and production, J&J could have reached a state of equal or equivalent Covid vaccine producer to its competitors.
3) Having a vaccine regimen of priming and booster shots  could have helped J&J to go for a collaboration with its rivals through 'mix and match' vaccination of J&J and AstraZeneca or   J&J and Pfizer/ BioNtech or J&J and Moderna .
I could see a steadfast- gain in the two dose regimen of Covid vaccine since it gives an inference about the side effects, development of antibodies , widening the gab between first and second doses, and an idea for tweaking of the booster charge whereas the single shot is conspicuous by the absence of its segmental analysis of the vaccine regime to enhance its efficacy and tweaking.
May I request J&J to read between the lines the statement of sputnik V  manufacturer - "" Sputnik Light ,the single dose vaccine is the first component of Sputnik V( two dose vaccine).Sputnik V remains the main vaccination tool""."

Ended up in ICU for three weeks on a vent and then they did a tracheotomy, rehab for six, got Bells Palsy at the same time.  I was lucky, there are two kind of GBS and one can recur.  Mine didn't.  I still have some small effects.  My doctor has told me twice not to get the vaccine, as have the doctors of three other people I know who have had GBS.  I'm really tired of the medical profession promoting the vaccine and saying you may have to think about it if you have an autoimmune problem.  That's not enough info.  You can also get GBS from the flu vaccine. Read the back of the release. In promoting vaccination they are ignoring thousands of people who need more info - and we're not getting it.  You can stay safe, vaccinated or not, and should. Those who are vaccinated are acting like they are wearing a suit of armor.  You're not."

2021-07-13 2:02,"Until there is a lot more information about how long immunity lasts in various groups of people, I think it is wise to plan to increase capacity, wise to remember how to roll out a program, and wise to continue to monitor how bad this is. And wise to not do a third shot for the classes of people who do have robust immunity. For those who do not, yes, line them up. 

Any new variant that can defeat the immunity engendered by the vaccine is a big threat.

And in the meantime, in the rest of the world (billions of people )that cannot afford to buy vaccines, is not favored to have a small percent of their population covered by 'donations' - this will make every unvaccinated person a variant factory, that will before too long travel around the world."

2021-07-13 2:26,"It’s nice that a Pfizer booster boosts the antibody level, but the question is how THIS vaccine helps manage the public health emergency facing the world.

Their vaccine would probably do far more good knocking down the level of disease in countries with rampant Covid and inadequate vaccine availability. 

They still need to solve the cold chain to insure effectiveness, and maybe most 3rd world countries aren’t suitable. But there have to be places where a first Pfizer vaccine is far more useful than a 1st world booster."
2021-07-13 2:27,"The goal of the vaccines, especially the mRNA vaccines, is to prevent serious illness and death. The vaccines do this already. If this changes we may need booster shots. No big deal. Otherwise, this is just more Pandemic Theater. Almost all of the vaccinated have returned to normal life and watch with morbid curiosity as the unvaccinated hurtle toward a cliff looming in the Fall. I wish them the best."
2021-07-13 2:37,"It is terrific that Pfizer is working on a more effective vaccine/booster for new variants. CDC was wrong to bad talk it, especially before even speaking with the scientists. Shows how poorly it continues to operate, they should be on top of all the data just as much as vaccine developers. This booster isn't a surprise to those in the public paying attention, why aren't they? Terrible messaging.

Here is a start to what they should have said: 
""It is terrific that work continues to improve effectiveness COVID vaccines. When the data supports it, newer vaccines having significant improved life saving effects should be placed into use. It may be that only segments of the population will ever need more than the first doses already received, but it is terrific that that scientists continue to strive to improve the effectiveness.  

Emergency authorization is used when very significant benefits address current serious health issues, if new vaccines show significant new benefits they should be put forward for approval.

Currently, data suggests that the existing approved vaccines provide all the protection that is needed. Scientific work should continue, independent of manufacturing activities. For now we must concentrate on continuing the current vaccine rollout for adults and adolescents."""
2021-07-13 3:16,"The government wants to downplay any suggestion that current vaccines are less effective than advertised.  If the Pfizer vaccine receives full FDA approval, does that mean a physician is authorized to prescribe a third dose for patients six months after having received their second shot, as a booster ?"
2021-07-13 3:19,"But are there any studies that show whether the Pfizer/Moderna vaccines diminish or prevent the risk of long-haul COVID in those vaccinated who get a more ""mild"" breakthrough illness?? Over time, the impacts of mild COVID can be devastating and ""severe"" if it induces long COVID, especially in young people who could live with it for 50+ years. So the risk of an initial acute severe illness and hospitalization is far less important to me than this other alternative, which it seems like Delta is inducing in terms of upping mild breakthroughs in those vaccinated by Pfizer. It's very frustrating to me that the CDC stopped tracking 'mild' breakthrough infections months ago, so we could have had this insight. I haven't found much research on this anywhere; if anyone here has come across something, please share it!!"
2021-07-13 3:20,"I think Pfizer is thinking more about shareholder value and executive compensation than public health. 

Hope I’m wrong, but I think it would be far better if they worked on a reformulation that’s easier to store and ship."
2021-07-13 2:31,"It’s important to remember that pharmaceutical companies’ first priority is profit.

Boosters would mean a sure source of continued profits.

Isn’t it a shame that public health is tied to the profits of companies who have proven over and over again that they will always put profits over people.

It’s difficult to trust them, or a government controlled by lobbyists and corporate interests."
2021-07-13 2:59,"And we wonder why people don't trust the Pharma industry. Here they are clearly pushing a vaccine for profit, without sufficient evidence that it decreases death and hospitalizations.

Remember, just the fact that a third dose raises antibody levels after it's administered (which it's obviously bound to do), isn't evidence that it significantly lowers hospitalization and death rates below the levels achieved with the first two doses."
2021-07-13 2:20,"Please don’t emphasize the conflict or difference in opinion. They’ll figure it out quickly and tweak the vaccine as necessary. Pfizer gives their opinion with data to back it. The CDC will make the final decision after weighing varying opinions. It’s NOT conflict. It’s NOT politics, or Pfizer trying to make a buck. It’s about doing the right thing. I trust them, and have a feeling we’ll be getting boosters in a few months"
2021-07-13 3:22,"Right now it sounds like a hard sell from Moderna and Pfizer. You DON'T repeat vaccines just because antibody levels are down. Antibodies are EXPECTED to wear off, but long-term immunity comes from T-cell and B-cell response; these are ""primed"" by vaccines to respond and start manufacturing antibodies when infection is detected. T-cell and B-cell immunity for many vaccines can last a lifetime. It remains to be seen how long these will last with Covid vaccines, but it is likely to be many years, and could well be a lifetime as well. Much too soon to start repeats."
2021-07-13 2:46,"Sadly, we are combatting preventable illness and death created by vaccine resistance. The narrative of booster doses somehow discouraging vaccination efforts is very likely an inconclusive or perhaps overvalued assumption. No one hesitates to get a recommended oil change as conditions warrant, doesn't your body deserve the same consideration? Those who resist vaccine efforts will likely continue absent the introduction of boosters."
2021-07-13 3:34,"I can understand why the government, with the resistance already to even first vaccinations, wouldn’t want to deal with the new problems attendant on boosters, and in terms of costs and logistics as well. I know that people want to simplify things and believe that we’re at the end of the struggle. But waiting for proof in the form of serious infections and yes, deaths in vaccinated people will be, in my view, waiting too long. By then the damage will be massive and hard to contain. Dealing with deadly threats is easier early than late."
2021-07-13 2:36,"the real issue here is there are populations in our community 
that need increased immunity, and individuals with compromised immunity need these boosters."
2021-07-13 4:12,"Peer reviews findings from tudies conducted by Johns Hopkins University with a substantial and diverse population of solid organ transplant patients, most of whom received the mRNA vaccines, revealed that most subjects had a minimal response to the first dose, and while the response to the second dose showed far lower antibody counts than the general population, nearly half of the subjects showed no measurable antibodies. While it is true that studies have yet produce meaningful data on B and T-cell production post-vaccination, there is no demonstrable human study of the extent to which these might confer immunity to COVID19. Large scale data indicates that the general population, with effective vaccination as measured by antibody presence, has a very significantly reduced risk of infection and severity.

The transplant population and other immunocompromised patients are already at severe medical risk. While the studies on the benefits of a booster shot are far from conclusive, studies do show that a booster has not increased the risk of organ rejection and other complications, and if it could mitigate the risk of infection for patients who live in hot zones or are exposed to the virus by caregivers and children,  a booster for these persons deserves FDA approval.

The need for more data justifies not issuing a blank check to Pfizer. Pharm's broad agenda though, appears to have deterred the FDA from acting upon the significant challenge facing millions at greatest risk."
2021-07-13 4:15,"I wonder just how well the benefit of a third vaccine shot is established and for which population?  If that is clearly defined and I am part of a group that could benefit, I am game for a third jab in my arm.  All that, of course, assuming that this third shot for me won't mean that someone else won't get their first or second one."
2021-07-13 3:12,Why not test those who received the mRNA vaccines in December and January for their current level of antibodies? Start with the health care workers in hospitals who were among the first to receive the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines.
2021-07-13 2:20,"I went through days of on-line  searching for the Covid vaccine last Spring.  I certainly hope that if the booster is needed, the Biden Administration will not make us go through another round of days searching for appointments at pharmacies."
2021-07-13 2:58,"“But the final decision on booster shots, several officials said after the meeting, will also depend on real-world information gathered by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention about breakthrough infections — those occurring in vaccinated people — that cause serious disease or hospitalization.” 

I’m pleasantly surprised by their integrity. Key words for us all to remember: real-world information, serious disease, hospitalization. Otherwise, please send scarce vaccine resources to countries that need them most."
2021-07-13 2:54,"Pfizer is providing the vaccines to Israel for free.  In exchange Israel is tracking for Pfizer the results of those people vaccinated.  There is a difference between vaccinating nine million people (in Israel) versus 320 (or so) million people in the United States, and paying for it.  So there is definitely something of a profit motive for Pfizer.  

That said, South Korea, another country that's doing well with its vaccination program, has contracted to buy another 106 million doses (for boosters) from Pfizer and Moderna."
2021-07-13 3:14,Why would the federal government discourage the development of boosters? Isn't that called being prepared?
2021-07-13 3:56,"We have known since the j&j data out of South Africa that variant boosters are required.  None of this is surprising.  

It would be great if I could get my kids vaccinated and if my government didn’t prevent me from protecting myself and my family.  2 hours to design a vaccine and two years to approve it.  Something is broken here."
2021-07-13 2:29,"This is greed , pure and simple.
The Federal Government paid for the development of the vaccine with the understanding that the vaccine would be free for US citizens.
Now Pfizer wants to use that technology to make and give unneeded booster shots which we or health insurance companies will pay them for.
To what viral variants are these vaccines directed at?
What is the evidence that vaccinated people with normal immune systems are falling seriously ill from any variant so far identified?
Of course antibody titers to the virus will decrease but that is a very crude and superficial way of measuring immunity.
The former head of the FDA under Trump is now employed by Pfizer.
That is all one has to know."
2021-07-13 3:51,Is anyone surprised a Big Pharma company is creating demand by playing on people’s fears?
2021-07-13 4:29,"There are many questioning the need for vaccination, yet Pfizer will just motivate them to say NO to the vaccine. 
Already what I'm hearing from those anti-vax is that Pfizer wants to guarantee itself a comfortable and recurrent source of income. Will Pfizer create a booster for any new variant? 
We have to keep in mind that Pfizer is a private company, and would do its best to increase its profit. 
Pfizer made a big mistake by advertising the need of a third shot, while the goal remains to vaccinate most of the country. For those who think we have to keep politics separated from vaccination, you have not been paying attention. There was no need to advertise a 3 shots in a country where some have not even gotten the first shot, for it comforts most anti-vax  that the vaccine is not working as intended."
2021-07-13 3:37,"If needed, let's not hesitate to appease the Flat Earth/Trump crowd who won't even get their first shot.  Do I trust either the CDC or Pfizer to make a subjective scientific decision free of political or economic influence?  

Nope."
2021-07-13 2:59,"This is typical of the American medical system: something is offered and lots of people say ""gimme"" without taking the time to think about whether it is necessary, how much it costs, and so on.

The question is whether a booster is actually needed, or whether it is profiteering. Everybody who gets the booster for free won't care, except that free doesn't actually exist -- whether it is your tax dollars or your insurance dollars, somebody pays for it. And beyond that, there is an opportunity cost if billions are spent on unnecessary boosters when they could have been spent preventing opioid overdoses or on other public health problems."
2021-07-13 2:46,"People, government scientists, are thinking about this without clarity. 
And Biden-Harris keep making appeals to authority and to “follow the science” which reads follow the scientists. 
Here’s what to do:
Just like the flu year after year, there are new strains & variants: Prepare boosters / née shots which include that protection. Authorize a 2021-22 vaccine / booster for those who want it. 
Do not withhold protection from all trying to get some protected, that is not good public policy. 
Biden should be leading the way to get every American the protection they want or need. 
Some want a booster / variant protection. 
Some still want an initial inoculation. 
Some are taking a wait and see. 
Some are not going to get inoculated."
2021-07-13 2:30,I think Pfizer knows far more about their vaccines and what’s in everyone’s best interest than the US government.
2021-07-13 3:01,"The CDC isn't any better under Walensky than when the Trump dude ran it. I am not a fan of any of her proclamations. Why can't she walk and chew gum? We know immunity may wane at 6 months. We know people over 50 have weaker immune systems and even fully vaccinated folks are getting the Delta variant. Why base your advice on the least educated of Americans "" we don't want to scare folks who won't get the vaccine if they need a booster""? Really? Not my problem. My problem is keeping Covid from ruining my health. If Pfizer science and Israeli real time data says we need a booster than let those of us who are responsible get the booster. In the meantime. I am also continuing to wear my mask indoors cuz data also shows that fully vaccinated folks are getting the Delta Variant and getting ill from it."
2021-07-13 3:27,"There is compelling data in Israel that Pfizer is not completely effective against the new varients. My friend's son and his three friends, all in their early thirties, all fully vaccinated, ate indoors at a CT restaurant ten days ago and all came down with Covid. 
It's easy to be suspicious of drug companies, but if we see a huge surge in cases -- which may yet happen -- getting a booster will be vital."
2021-07-13 3:42,It’s not a matter if a booster shot will be needed it’s a matter of when it will be needed. I wish the CDC and others would be more upfront instead of initially dismissing the need. The worst scenario is opening up everything and letting things get out of control again and we’re back at square one.  Based on the fact there needs to be an analysis of the data means everyone is flying by the seat of their pants on this one. I wish for just wants things could be done proactive and a booster shot required
2021-07-13 5:23,"Reading the comments, there are a lot of people who base the need of a booster on fear. The actual need is much more mathematical. The problem is on the lack of transparency and data acquisition. First there is not a one size fits all answer. Risks and benefits are not the same for each group. I see many different groups that would have different answers including three broad categories of prior vaccinated, covid recovered and immunocompromised. Then these groups should be broken up by age. Actually, what better use of artificial intelligence then to analyze hundreds of hard data points and follow groups out looking at hard endpoints and certainly not just mildly symptomatic infection. But hey the CDC is still ignoring covid recovered would deserves to be considered separately."
2021-07-13 5:35,"In March 2020, no one would have believed that we would have a safe and effective vaccine today for anyone who wished to get it. I trust Pfizer more than the CDC, especially  after they lifted indoor masking requirements without a vaccine verification mechanism. I hear of more and more breakthroughs  in fully vaccinated people."
2021-07-13 2:27,They should approve it now.  Just in case.  We may not be done with this pandemic yet.
2021-07-13 5:57,"Could we stop offering doughnuts and lottery tickets to people who have made the willful decision to not get  vaccinated and instead focus on giving those at greatest risk the best possible immunity? Sad to say, there are people out there who really need the vaccine and would take it except they don't know were to go and how to get there.  Too bad there was hysterical push back on people going door to door with information by the people who have decided they will never get vaccinated."
2021-07-13 6:29,"I almost took the Janssen shot, but I didn't due to complications in the week prior to my vaccination date. In addition, it seemed like everyone in New York was taking Pfizer.
Now I kind of regret I didn't take Janssen."
2021-07-13 9:34,"Well, the information coming out is certainly confusing. A week or two ago there were reports that the vaccines might just confer long-term immunity and that booster shots might not be needed or at least not needed for a long time. Now we have other 'experts' saying that immunity 'wanes' in 6-8 months, which seems to indicate that we might need boosters yearly, if not more often. I get that we are early in the process, but those are certainly radically different reports..."
2021-07-13 9:36,"Why, indeed, was this meeting held in private? You want to counter suspicion and distrust with regard to vaccination? Only utmost transparency will do that."
2021-07-13 11:41,"The conversation about whether third shots are necessary or even beneficial shouldn't be intertwined with that regarding how many Americans have received their first and second shots. It's no longer a case of supply in the latter, it's demand.  If there is evidence that a booster helps prevent transmission and disease, especially with Delta, then those of us who have been enthusiastic recipients of the vaccines to this point should be able to benefit from whatever science dictates is beneficial so long as anyone desiring a first round can access vaccination."
2021-07-13 2:27,the chances of dying from covid after being fully vaccinated are similar to being struck by lightning. Until you stop going outside please don't worry about a booster shot.
2021-07-13 2:48,"But wait, isn't the vaxxed mob screaming that the unvaxxed are murdering everyone? 

How do they explain this graph?

And what about the Breakthrough infections when those that are vaxxed get infected?   This is what the CDC says:

“CDC received reports from 48 U.S. states and territories of 5,186 patients with COVID-19 vaccine breakthrough infections who were hospitalized or died.”

Instead of screaming conspiracy theorist!, maybe people will start to believe when I say that the vax does not work near as well as they say.  If you can understand how statistics is misused, you will realize that the 95% efficacy rate, which I've long said is bogus and too-good-to-be-true, is absolutely not 95% — but only 0.7% for Pfizer and 1.1% for Moderna.  Hardly worth getting and mathematically impossible to be responsible for the decline in the infection rate.  

This virus comes and goes as it will - with no concern for masks, or lockdowns, or vaccinations.  And it will be back.

See here for the difference between absolute risk reduction and relative risk reduction:

2021-07-13 4:27,“We are prepared ...”  We aren't prepared for anything.
2021-07-13 5:21,"I'm 74 and on kidney dialysis. I received the Pfizer vaccine in February. If the vaccine loses significant effectiveness after six months, and that effectiveness can be restored with a booster shot, I want that booster shot.

What I do not want is public health officials resisting booster shots because they fear some people will get mad because the first two doses did not provide permanent protection. If vaccines do not protect forever, if booster shots are needed, that's not a big (expletive deleted) deal. It just the truth: public health officials must always tell the truth, the whole truth, nothing but the truth, and not wait to tell it.

If my physicians recommend getting a third Pfizer jab, I'll get it. Meanwhile, I still wear masks, including KN95s from Projectn95, because I live in a county where less than half of the population is fully vaccinated, and almost no one wears a mask in public. They think Mr. Covid has gone away when in fact he's lurking in the shadows, ready to leap out and blackjack unvaccinated barefaced fools."
2021-07-13 5:47,"Trump would just forced the availability of boosters on the CDC, FDA and NIH  and not wait until breakthroughs with hospitalizations occur:  then it is too late.  Trump and Pence would have also attended the meeting.  Notice Biden (and Harris??? - who is that??) are missing in action - the last we saw of them was when they threw a COVID party a few days ago. The Israelis are pre-emptying.  They figure pre-empting is a far better strategy than allowing  the chance of prevalent breakthroughs  generating severe disease  The French are also approving boosters.  We already know how poorly the US government scientists have served us throughout the pandemic. And now it seems they follow the politics and not logic and reason, just like Biden."
2021-07-13 7:28,"Big pharma are snake oil salesmen masquerading under the guise of science. The reason the industry is calling for a booster is because trials were never conducted properly; there are a litany of unknowns. I have a vaccinated friend who recently tested positive. She said, well, so much for the vaccine. Now the suits are recommending the sheep line up for a booster. I'm reminded of David Letterman's outro, ""Sit, Ubu, sit. Good dog!"""
2021-07-13 10:35,"So, let me get this straight.

1. We aren’t tracking breakthrough infections unless they lead to hospitalization even though 10-30% of all infections, including asymptomatic ones, lead to long Covid, which sure seems like a disease state to me. 

2. We’ve essentially dropped all masking, distancing, et al, with less than 50% fully vaccinated.

3. We are currently (permanently?) on the honor system. We won’t require vaccine passports or no jab, no job. 

4. A partially immune-escaping variant is ripping through the country.

5. We won’t consider boosters even though Israel, a first-world nation with very sophisticated, world-class biotech which is way ahead of us on vaccination, has deemed it necessary because we are trying to convince the apparently unconvinceable to get vaccinated. By asking pretty-please.

6. We aren’t bothering to vax the world, either, even though we know not doing so nearly guarantees worse immunity-escaping variants unless by some miracle the virus is already out if moves to make. Because intellectual property…or something.

Gee, it’s a good thing we’re following the science instead of warping our response by kowtowing to the craziest, far-right nutcases."
2021-07-13 3:13,Pfizer is “working the refs” of public opinion because they know half the population thinks the FDA is a political party and that Tony Fauci is anything less than a model public servant. Shame on Pfizer playing games to fluff their shareholders first. Despicable.
2021-07-13 6:08,"In the meantime... cases of Covid in the US almost doubled in the last 2 weeks.... Are long-haul cases going to increase  proportionally?
There are way too many 'experts', with their own agendas in the US.
Maybe Pfizer knows what they are talking about, eh?
Are we  going to be debating the dangers of breakthrough infections to death? Trump is gone, but the same bureaucracy is still in place.
CDC and FDA did not distinguish themselves in either the Covid, or previous health problems, if anyone should remember.
I would certainly pay attention to what Israel is doing - they are doers who protect their people, and not the perennial debating club...."
2021-07-13 6:42,"This is ridiculous. Since getting another dose of the vaccine apparently does no lasting harm, what is the downside of erring on the side of caution and allowing people who want it to get another dose? There seems to be an available surplus of vaccines at this point anyway."
2021-07-13 2:23,"The CDC is a joke and makes decisions based on politics. Fauci is the same guy who told us not to wear masks. Sad to say, but I cannot rely on US agencies to provide reliable directions. Same with WHO, which is compromised by Chinese money."
2021-07-13 7:55,Anyone noticed that covid cases are rising strongly?
2021-07-13 10:34,"I am really concerned that the Biden Administration is factoring in  the reaction of those who refuse  the vaccine,  to any  decision on recommending  a booster shot  for those of us who  are vaccinated. 
Frankly I am not interested in whether these people are put off getting the vaccine  because a booster shot may be  in the offing.  There is far too much emphasis been put on those Americans  who refuse to be vaccinated the focus now  should be on fighting the pandemic globally .
 Such as providing countries who don't have access to the vaccine an opportunity to acquire our excess vaccines  so that their citizen can be given the opportunity to be vaccinated. 
Americans have had ample time to get vaccinated , there are those who for medical reasons can not do so and those people must be protected.  
As for those who choose to not be vaccinated for political reasons  that is their choice 'poor as it might be'  but as a society  we have no obligation to keep coddling them. 
If they get sick with Covid 19 or one of its variants  they brought their illness on themselves by poor decision making., leaving the unfortunate first responders to deal with the results of their  stupidity ."
2021-07-13 3:57,"Rather than use objective data offered by the post vaccine spike protein antibody test, US officials argue that the number of breakthrough infections should be used as the indicator for booster shots. This is ridiculous! The CDC stopped tracking breakthrough infections unless they result in death or hospitalization so their data is severely limited and does not prove efficacy of these vaccines. Astonishingly, the CDC claims to have no data on antibody response months after vaccinations of over 177 million Americans. If this is true is is evidence of gross incompetency. Dr. Fauci, who is not responsible for this type of testing, now says we are gathering data and hold off on boosters for now. I have gathered enough data from simply testing my own patient’s spike protein antibody tests in the last 3 months to confirm the need for boosters based on those results. It is reprehensible that the WHO and CDC now oppose boosters in the US, while the vaccine makers are recommending   them, claiming they are “ following the science”. Ironically the CDC   says no antibody testing is recommended post vaccine because the vaccine maker’s data showed everyone made antibodies in their studies. But now when the same people recommend booster based on their own data, the CDC questions the validity. My data shows over 50% of J&J, 15% Pfizer and 2%Moderna vaccinated had no antibody response and would likely develop full immunity with one shot of Moderna."
2021-07-13 4:49,""" ... federal health officials who say the extra doses are not necessary now.""

Excuse me, but who's paying your federal salaries? 

Don't gamble with our health when we're the ones who'll pay for those shots, not you. 

My brother, who's had both Pfizer shots, just informed me that two fully vaccinated people in his county just died of COVID.

You politicians of both parties need to stop acting like the US Treasury is your party's personal piggy bank every time you win an election. It's OUR money, not yours."
2021-07-13 2:24,"If a third vaccination keeps me from getting sick and dying, I say ""bring it on""."
2021-07-13 2:25,How about the Moderna vaccine? It it perfect or have they not yet gotten around to tearing into it?
2021-07-13 3:48,"Come on, Pfizer wants to 'double dip' and reap the rewards. Who will pay for the 'booster'? If the CDC doesn't support it then private insurance will have a field day of profits. The science needs to call it."
2021-07-13 6:28,Why not work on booster shots with new variants in mind? Let's be real: We're about done in the USA with vaccinating the willing. The others will get their immunity the hard way. Assuming they live.
2021-07-13 10:49,"The CDC should immediately recommended vaccination boosters for the immunocompromised, and that they have not already done so is unconscionable!!  There is plenty of evidence available showing that immunocompromised people do not mount effective immune responses to the virus even after 2 doses of the mRNA vaccines, and that a third dose improves response substantially.  France and Israel have recognized this, but the US stubbornly has not.  Instead, US messaging has almost entirely been on *not* recommending boosters for the fully vaccinated, and has focused on getting vaccines to the not fully vaccinated.  Certainly that is a critical priority, but it does not have to exclude giving third shots to the immunocompromised, too.  By refusing to recommend this, the CDC has consigned this very vulnerable population to limbo, making them live in continued isolation and fear -- effectively throwing them under a bus!!!    Shameful!"
2021-07-13 2:53,I am fully vaccinated without the booster shot. I am very confident in the COVID-19 vaccines regardless of its country’s origin. I am concern about the recalcitrant unvaccinated folks who allow COVID-19 virus to replicate and mutate to more transmissible and deadlier variants possibly evading the current vaccines.
2021-07-13 4:37,"I think Pfizer for their amazing vaccine...  but I would like to see how much money Pfiser made off of it. And I would like to see the evidence that promotes a booster.  And I would like to see what they stand to make from that.  I'm tired of being a taxpaying stooge supporting a corrupt government bought,  lobbied, dominated, and dictated by corporate America.  I think most of us are."
2021-07-13 6:17,Get more people vaccinated with 2 doses and then work on a booster.  Everyone must be vaccinated for everyone to be safe.
2021-07-13 12:14,"People already have access to an effective vaccine booster.  Where vaccination rates are low (under 50%), masks continue to be an essential tool.

Vaccine = 90-94% effective against Delta.
Vaccine + medical grade mask = 99.9% effective.

My mask is my seat belt.  My vaccination is my airbag.  Protected by both.
Don't be the last person to die in this war, or be disabled by long-haul Covid.
I think, therefore I mask."
2021-07-13 5:16,"I say follow the Israelis on this one.  I am learning of more frequent examples of Covid-19 breakthrough cases among the fully vaccinated.  The CDC is a thoroughly politicized organization at this point, despite their good intentions, and they will be late to the game in recommending a booster as they were with most of their guidance since March, 2020.  The tell in their case is when they state that a booster is not needed ""at this time.""  Leaving themselves an out, of course.  The virus has been two steps ahead of us at every turn.  Why would anyone operate on the assumption it won't happen again and plan for it?"

No I have more trust in the scientists at Pfizer , they made their vaccine and they alone would know if a booster is needed. 

Furthermore how dare the Biden Administration base my well being on whether Anti Vaxers will balk at the news of the requirement of a booster shot . 
I frankly could care less about these people or what they think, and I am frustrated by  Fauci and others focusing on their feelings and not on  the science .
Since  we are all so concerned about choice and personal freedom in the country, I am ready for a booster shot if that is what it takes to keep me from getting sick with the Coronavirus, that is a choice I am making ."
2021-07-13 5:44,"Booster schmooster. I was in Green River Wyoming for a stop for dinner and zero people out of the hundred plus, both in  the bar and restaurant, no one was wearing a mask and most likely almost none of the young folks drinking and none of the kids in the restaurant are vaccinated. The real worry is not the booster shots, at least not yet since the vaccine still works. When half the population is not vaccinated and taking zero precautions, given that the R-naught of the Delta variant is double or more than the parent original strain, if half the population is vulnerable the doubled R-naught means the virus will spread as fast or faster than last winter in some places. The regions with lower vaccination rates below 50% are definitely facing a fourth wave looming, that they deny could happen. Since the new variants are both more virulent and infect kids more schools will be hit hard in regions where the kids' parents are vaccine and virus deniers. When the parents play down the danger, expecting rule compliance from their kids is asking too much. This pandemic is not over, despite fools who think it is over."

Then no one will remember the successes of the past Spring, and the Administration will be punished in the mid terms."
2021-07-13 6:09,"Think about how many variables are in play here: We have multiple dueling datasets - Israel’s, Pfizer’s, the UK’s, etc - on different genetic populations with different degrees of exposure risk, different overall health, different age profiles at vaccination, and different timespans between vaccination and antibody counts.

Now look at collinearity. That is, one variable, say health status at vaccination, that explains some of the same things as another, say, antibody production. Or how a new variant showing up late to the party may mimic a time-dependent effect - waning immune response - actually because it’s more infective. 

Then, consider basic immunology. Antibody production is only one measure, and probably not the best, of immune response. 

Finally, take a glance at the moral optics of rich nations getting a third shot when many poorer countries haven’t started. 

Conclusion: Stop doomscrolling."
2021-07-13 7:28,"""Mild"" cases matter. They quite often lead to long covid. Keeping people out of the ICU is not mission accomplished.

2021-07-13 6:56,"The error by the CDC and state or local departs of health to no longer track Covid19 cases unless they are “serious” and to not require or even advise testing for Covid19 among vaccinated people — even after a known exposure — was a consequential mistake that is robbing scientists, policy-makers, and the rest of us of useful data that could help us now and in the future.  This is includes in accurately assessing whether and when booster shots of the vaccine should be given.

What a loss, and what a shame."
2021-07-13 12:02,"It has been made clear in recent reporting that Covid will remain as a infectious disease indefinitely. It has been compared to the flu which requires annual boosters. No one seems to be railing against annual flu shots. Why is a Covid booster so upsetting to the CDC? It was the nonsensical delays and denials of the threat of Covid that got us so infected during the previous administration. As to the anti-vaxxers, they have the right to refuse vaccination altogether. Just as they also have the right to carry a gun. But they do not have the right kill people with those guns. Yet somehow we don’t acknowledge that an unvaccinated person walking amidst us is carrying a lethal weapon and they don’t have the right to kill people. If the CDC can’t get behind the science and present the idea of boosters positively and the anti-vaxxers are free to walk among the vaccinated, it’s s no brainer to make it the law that proof of vaccination must be carried and masks required of those who are unvaccinated. It’s also a no brainer for the administration to start a positive campaign about boosters. Why wait?"
2021-07-13 10:08,"This is a hard one to call. Pfizer has economic reasons for pushing a third vaccine now. The CDC and FDA have reasons to calm people, so that more get fully vaccinated. The Delta variant has made plain what was already obvious to many, half-vaccinated is not vaccinated. Get the two shots, then stay tuned"
2021-07-13 10:21,In every tragedy there is opportunity. Pfizer is certainly trying to capitalize (more) handsomely on this tragedy.
2021-07-13 12:13,"I’m concerned. I’m closing in on one year after my 2nd Pfizer shot, while many other Americans are only half-way there, or less so. I’ve stayed safe by staying home and masking up, and stayed healthy. But do I have the same, or at least the necessary levels of antibodies to still be protected? At age 85 I don’t want to be part of the experimental group."
2021-07-13 11:01,"If it is safe to get a booster, then let us have a booster. There is no downside."
2021-07-13 9:47,CDC will base the decision on the sturdy of breakthrough infections. CDC also has stopped collecting data on breakthrough infections. I have a feeling that people work at CDC because they could not get jobs elsewhere.
2021-07-13 12:56,There is already a lot of evidence out there. CDC needs to expand its horizons and not just look at data it collects.
2021-07-13 12:53,"As usual, every country goes it alone and thinks they alone have the answers. A better question than for Pfizer would be to question Israel, why they agree with Pfizer."
2021-07-13 13:17,"Any article addressing Pfizer’s advocacy for a Covid booster shot should insert information about Moderna’s actions, if any. An informed journalist would be aware that many Americans, if not more, received the Moderna vaccine as those who received a Pfizer vaccine.

This article did not mention Moderna; thus, readers did not receive all the information they should have received."

2021-07-13 13:59,"Meanwhile, thousands of Americans who were on immunosuppressants at the time of their vaccinations are testing negative for antibodies.  When will they be able to get revaccinated?"
2021-07-13 15:54,"We started with the government pleading for vaccine companies to come up with an effective vaccine as quickly as possible. Now we have successful and profitable vaccine companies, riding the wave of their admirable success, pleading with government to allow them to sell more vaccine. Where is the evidence that it's needed? It's coming from the direction of those who stand to benefit financially before we have much evidence for actual medical need. We have seen this Pharma movie before. The industry apparently can't help itself."
2021-07-13 2:58,"The FDA is holding back on fully approving the Pfizer vaccine? Yet they would approve an Alzheimer's drug that barely does anything - except cost $56,000 a year for treatment?  Ah, we forgot, Biogen ""made nice"" to the FDA.  Does Pfizer need to learn how to take the right people at the FDA out for dinner?

This is all getting more than absurd.  Why can't we have the old trustworthy FDA and the old trustworthy CDC back at work?  And we criticize Italy for being corrupt?  We are just beginning to look a bit stupid....of course never corrupt."
2021-07-13 5:04,"So every time Pfizer rolls out a you-need-a-booster, how many $billions profit is there?"
2021-07-13 9:26,"Will I need a booster shot? Most likely. The real question is ""When?"". Is a 3rd shot now ""too much of a good thing""? Is it possible that too much vaccine could cause the body to develop an immunity to the vaccine? I guess we'll have to watch the results of Israel giving 3rd doses now to get that answer."
2021-07-13 15:31,"In any other industry, this would be called ""analysis paralysis."" And a total lack of common sense."
2021-07-13 15:47,"Israel already decided.  In the US, it's all about the Benjamins."
2021-07-13 16:19,"The heroes of the pandemic are the innovators who created the  vaccines and monoclonal antibody treatments.  The zeros are the snail-paced, group-think, boiler-plate advice, risk adverse bureaucrats at the CDC, FDA, and NIH.  Sounds like Pfizer wants to keep ahead of this and are data driven.  Sounds like the bureaucrats want to be red tape control freaks."
2021-07-13 15:28,"I don't want to be an 'evidence point' --  fully vaccinated in February, I would take a booster NOW in a heartbeat."
2021-07-13 2:33,Is this being driven by the science at Pfizer or the Accountants at Pfizer. The latter seems to be the answer. The smart thinking on a booster would be one of a different type of vaccine so that you have a woven immunity rather than a linear one. Mono culture is not effective in the long term.
2021-07-13 20:05,"I'm with the WHO, which is pleading for more vaccines donated to more needy countries. If that doesn't happen then we'll be in a-new-variant-a-week territory, where countries with unvaccinated populations are fertile ground for burgeoning  mutations. And each one is a new roll of the dice for whether current vaccines can keep up.

It seems premature, if not scandalous, for wealthy countries to be debating capturing more of the existing vaccine supply for Vax3, when  millions in poor countries are infected, dying and spreading deadly new varieties of covid for lack of a first dose.."
2021-07-13 21:09,"NYT:  Back in December, before the queen of England and the president-elect of the United States had their turns, the media mogul Rupert Murdoch received a dose of a Covid-19 vaccine. Afterward, he urged everyone else to get it, too.

That says everything about the sins of Rupert Murdoch, Trumper Carlson, and Fox News."
2021-07-13 12:46,"This is stupid. Just make covid shots annual, like the flu shot, which I get every fall."

Americans always know best, too darn arrogant. We've been here before thousands of times...
Doomed to never learn from mistakes....."
2021-07-13 3:47,"Honestly thinking I should just go down to CVS and get another shot. I’m fully vaccinated but why the heck not get a booster? I mean, are they checking to see who is fully vaccinated and who isn’t? Is there any harm in getting a third shot?"
2021-07-09 16:01,This sounds like it is for the benefit of big businesses who want employees in the office. Does it come with hazard pay for the teachers?
2021-07-09 16:07,"I think in most cases, what each school will end up doing will depend upon how things go in each school district and community.

One of my brother's co-workers was fully vaccinated.  She young daughter came home from school and she ended up getting COVID.  Granted, her case was not extreme, no hospitalization was required, but she was sick for almost a week.

The various vaccines are 90-93% effective.  But people can and do still get this virus.

For kids, teachers and staff members to continue wearing masks and keeping a distance, even if vaccinated, can only help ensure a safer work/school/learning environment.

But with the C.D.C., all of this could change once again come Labor Day.  Who knows the kind of damage and harm this Delta variant could bring."
2021-07-09 16:08,"Finally, a bit of sanity and common sense. Somebody finally realized the high toll being inflicted on these kids. This was long overdue."
2021-07-09 16:10,The Biden administration is realizing sticking with the teacher unions will be a death sentence in 2022 with parents who vote. My very liberal hometown's pro-union BOE members will probably be out next election. And it may have consequences for other politicians that stuck with them.
2021-07-09 16:15,"These guidelines are very welcome, common sense and most importantly evidence-based. In person schooling is essential for learning, social-emotional well being/development and in many cases for access to food and security.  1+ years of data has shown that when proper mitigation strategies are put in place schools are very safe, so the debate about whether to open schools or not should be behind us.     The CDC guidelines also highlight the need for everyone who is eligible to be fully vaccinated as soon as possible.  We are very fortunate in the US that everyone now has easy access to the most effective vaccines, which also protect against the delta variant."
2021-07-09 16:15,"My school age kids got the vaccination and I have no issue with them going back with minimal distancing and mask wearing. 
The problem for me, is when 
UN vaccinated people-students and teachers-want to return and adamantly deny that Covid is a threat. I just can’t with that line of thinking. It endangers the entire school community."
2021-07-09 16:20,That will be a nightmare for teachers to enforce in the classroom.
2021-07-09 16:22,"When are we going to make the connection that cases were low in our schools BECAUSE we were all wearing masks??? (My school was fully open for in-person learning all of this past school year.) Distancing is a farce in kindergarten (I have seen it first hand daily), as is effective hand-washing, so it seems a logical conclusion that masks work. So, the CDC says to take them off….this should be fun."
2021-07-09 16:22,"Everything changes so fast with this pandemic. For my unable-to-be-vaccinated child, I'll make a decision about the safety of going back in late August — once I know whether community covid rates stay low or spike with the Delta variant."
2021-07-09 16:23,With a new more transmissible variant.  Masks should not be a choice.  My kids all vaccinated are going back to school and one is off to college.  Have we stopped thinking that covid infection even in the vaccinated could pose long term health issues?  It took only four years to turn us against each other and destroy our own country.
2021-07-09 16:24,"Resignation is what brings peace to the world and restores balance.  Enough presuming, finally.  Let the kids play rather than leading life in a specimen jar."
2021-07-09 16:24,"The inability of the media to properly communicate relative risk during this pandemic led to a collective fear based mania that has been hard to control. Data from countries across the world makes it clear that children are not at risk of hospitalization or death from covid. I mean “not at risk” the same way I would mean I am not at risk of dying as I drive to work, or my child is not at risk of getting kidnapped on his way to school i.e., it is so unlikely that it doesn’t paralyze me into fearful inaction, but I do take reasonable safety precautions for both.  Now that everyone over 12 years old, and especially the over 50 cohort (which in my area accounts for 99% of covid deaths) has been given the opportunity to be  vaccinated, there is no rational, data informed reason to continue restrictions in schools. There is no perfect, risk free solution, but we can't wait for some unknowable date when the virus is eradicated. I hate to say it, but the moment Trump bellowed he was  for schools reopening, a lot of people reflexively opposed it to thwart him. It was one of the worst public health mistakes we made in the U.S."
2021-07-09 16:25,"In areas like ours, with low vaccination rates, people laughed at the mandates when they were required. This ""guidance"" puts the most vulnerable kids at risk- kids with unvaccinated families who take no precautions. A politically palatable, likely deadly move."
2021-07-09 16:25,"""The draft guidance is a sharp departure from the CDC’s past recommendations, bluntly acknowledging that many students have suffered during virtual learning and that a uniform approach is not useful when virus caseloads and vaccination rates vary by region."""
2021-07-09 16:26,CDC continues to issue useless guidance.  How is this supposed to be enforced?  What about variants? Especially in schools which are often unable to distance students and ventilate buildings?  At this point I wish the CDC would be dissolved and a new agency would take its place. And not a government agency at that.
2021-07-09 16:28,"I disagree both with those who say that unnecessary risks are being taken with young children and those who claim that relaxing the restrictions is long overdue.

There is a ripple effect of any decision made, and we tend to ignore the ripples when they are good results and pay attention only when they reflect some kids and families encountering problems.

I think that the approach by President Biden has been reasonable. We need to listen to the experts at the C.D.C. and in the Public Health Corps. Their recommendations have changed, but that reflects more experience and knowledge about Covid-19. Remember when the focus was on wiping all surfaces, before the experts realized that the virus is spread by airborne droplets and mists?

Parents and grandparents are understandably emotional about young kids getting sick. That's okay, and it is the job of the scientists and psychologists to teach families about the long-term damage continuing virtual learning."
2021-07-09 16:30,I work in special education. The 3-feet away rule is an impossibility. I remain grateful for the effectiveness of masks.
2021-07-09 16:39,"It would help parents and officials make informed decisions  if counties would report new cases by age group, so we could quickly see if the virus is taking hold in preschool or elementary populations, who have not yet been cleared to receive the vaccinations."
2021-07-09 16:39,"While some children may have suffered under distance learning, others have thrived. I hoped this pandemic would trigger a mindful, strategic shift away from one-size-fits-all educational delivery."
2021-07-09 16:44,"I am sure that most parents desperately wish that their under-12 kids could get vaccinated. Most also understand the risk the Delta variant poses to the unvaccinated population. But, why is it fair to keep schools closed when literally everything else in town is open? Kids have gotten a raw deal during this pandemic. 

Schools can open safely as long as administrators continue to keep the protocols in place, such as not letting adults inside the school who aren’t employees, and continuing to contact trace when an infection is reported.  If kids keep wearing masks indoors and have frequent mask-free breaks outdoors, I don’t understand why they can’t return to in-person learning. Those who are too scared to send kids back should be able to keep them online. Let parents decide what’s right for their child. And the vaccine makers must hurry up and find a safe vaccine for kids. That should be a priority. Once that happens, I hope that the vaccine will be a school enrollment requirement just like measles vaccinations etc."
2021-07-09 16:45,"The NYC testing site near me in Queens hardly has anybody in line anymore. I tested negative earlier this Spring during allergy season. That was my first test. No waiting in line then, and there were only two people behind me. I have not been tested since then, and continue to mask up in public. 

So if so few are getting tested, how can the infection rate be a reliable number? Are kids going to be tested in schools?"
2021-07-09 16:50,"Our sons senior year of high school was a disaster from a learning perspetive.  Zoom classes, little student engagement, teachers unions more concerned about teachers than students - a waste of a year (one parents perspective).

We moved our son to aother school after having repeated meetings with the school.   As the school was not teaching our son - we moved our son to a better school for him with in person teaching.  Bottom line - the private schools did a better job of teaching through the pandemic than our public schools."
2021-07-09 16:52,"I will say that as a parent of three young children (ages 5, 3 and 1), I feel like parents of young kids have been completely ignored through much of the pandemic. Yes, this is a disease that drastically impacts older adults, but it often feels like parents of young children have been forgotten about in terms of safety and recommendations. 

My own experience is entirely unique. My 3 year old was diagnosed with leukemia in December 2019. Our entire family has been living in quarantine conditions throughout the pandemic. I am so completely tired of hearing how masks are so oppressive and that people don’t want to wear them. I can assure you that no one is more tired of this pandemic than my family. My 5 year old is going to be in kindergarten this year and to me it makes sense that students that are not vaccinated should wear masks. But, alas, masks are optional. The rugged individualism of this country is astounding. At times, I am completely appalled. I am grateful we don’t live in a low vaccination area."
2021-07-09 16:53,"As someone who was homeschooled for half of my K-12 education, raised in a single-parent family well below poverty level (with a mother who worked outside the home), and now holds a doctorate degree after graduating with honors - I have been astounded by the implication that if all children don't have face-to-face education outside the home they are doomed to fail. I am also astounded by the implication that the ONLY way parents can be contributing members of society is if they are able to hold jobs outside the home and therefore have to find daycare (oh, sorry, I mean schooling) for their children. Rather than being emphasized as areas of true education and learning available to all, public schools are being shoved to the forefront as the places where kids can be taken care of while the parents go back to work. 
I am NOT in any way suggesting that schools shouldn't reopen or that public schooling isn't important. I AM saying that humans - including children - are amazingly resilient, we are capable of learning and growing at any age and all stages of life, and we should be (and should have been) focusing on how to make education in ANY format feasible rather than arguing about fully reopening before it's safe."
2021-07-09 16:56,"I’m glad the CDC is being clear that schools need to fully bring kids back, and that school closures cause harm.

But they need to be specific about the metrics for removing masks inside. Leaving it up to local health data and districts will mean more fighting all year, and wildly different approaches based more on politics than public health metrics.

As it stands now, around half of schools seem poised to reopen without masks, and the other half with them. We’re heading into another natural experiment again, and hopefully the data will be clear and the CDC will be swifter in issuing updated guidelines based on it.

It’s worth noting that kids under age 12 have attended school without masks in much of Europe throughout the pandemic."
2021-07-09 17:02,Before returning to school students should first get tested if results are negative then get vaccinated. Bring your COVID-19 vaccination record card and show proof you are fully vaccinated. Encourage all students to support a safe school campus.
2021-07-09 17:03,"Throughout the pandemic, the policy dilemma has been to balance two good things that are in fundamental tension:  decreasing the spread of the infection versus opening society - and this case - reopening schools for in-person instruction.

In my state and many others, school districts take the word ""independent"" in their names quite literally.  I am not being critical, since they can only do what the parents are willing to do.

The war against the pandemic will be won or lost on a far bigger battlefield than just schools.  The science - meaning the balancing of the science of disease propagation AND the science of education - greatly favors resuming in-person instruction.

Bravo CDC.  Bravo Dr. Walensky."
2021-07-09 17:03,"I am a pro-science liberal and am still awaiting evidence that masks should be worn by elementary school kids. It’s clear that masks are useful for adults and older teens, but they’ve been deemed less useful for young children by the WHO and European CDC. Why won’t our CDC acknowledge the inconsistency in their guidance vs. that of the WHO and ECDC?

A recent study of schools in three US states found that mask mandates in schools matter when they are for adults and teachers, but masks for kids make no difference. When will the CDC come out with clear guidance on this?

2021-07-09 17:03,"If the guidance is that unvaccinated persons at schools be masked, and not that all should wear masks, then it behooves schools and school districts to require valid and verified proof of vaccination from any and everyone going without masks.  

Our kids aren’t allowed to be vaccinated, as they are under 12.  Especially for 10-12 yr olds, who are, the CDC has previously stated, at higher risk of “bad Covid” than their younger schoolmates, relying on only the honor system regarding vaccination status  will be a mistake, possibly a deadly or disabling one.

We will hold school accountable for negligence if they fail to require and verify proof of full Covid vaccination just as they do for MMR and chicken pox, and as a direct or indirect result we are harmed."
2021-07-09 17:07,"“For the FIRST time, I really think they hit it on the nose,” said Dr. Benjamin Linas, an infectious disease specialist at Boston University. “I THINK it’s science-based and right on the mark.”"
2021-07-09 17:09,"If there is even a whiff of restricting the school learning in the fall, that will be the political death sentence to those responsible. All children should be in the classrooms, and those who don't want to can avail themselves to the various home schooling programs in existence."
2021-07-09 17:14,"We have 3 young kids with the oldest being 7.  They cannot be vaccinated even based on the current vaccines.  Even ignoring the fact that the vaccines have not been properly vetted (otherwise they would have been FDA approved, as opposed to approved under an EUA process).  We are working from home and have been maintaining a strict no interactions policy.  After all, even the CDC would agree that the best way to deal with COVID-19 is not to get it.  

Why is the CDC insisting that schools force them back to in-person learning without a vaccine?  In light of reports that the Delta variant is more virulent over longer distances, how does it make sense to say that 3 feet is enough?  Does it not make sense to maintain a proper online version for those willing and able to keep the kids at home?  I understand most people can not or will not make the sacrifices needed to do it properly at home.  But for those of us who can and will, why not keep the online option open?  After all, that enables reduced in-person class size with proper distancing.  

Our teacher was teaching both in-person and online at the same time and did an amazing job.  The kids were getting as good of instruction in-person as online.  That requires minimal additional effort.  

Los Angeles will be offering a ""self-study"" option which will not be nearly equal to full instruction.  Why reduce the quality of education of those who are willing to take the hit so that the rest could be properly distanced?"
2021-07-09 17:16,"“We know that in-person learning is really important for school, for children, for their educational, social and emotional well-being, and so we really want to get kids back in the classroom,” Erin Sauber-Schatz, a captain in the Public Health Service Commissioned Corps who helped lead the C.D.C. task force that wrote the guidance, said in an interview.
Since when they know that in-person learning is really important for school, for children?

“Physical distancing is still a recommended strategy,” she added, but she emphasized that if schools do not have sufficient space to keep all students three feet apart, “that should not keep children out of the classroom in the fall.”
There goes danger of the virus."
2021-07-09 17:18,"Physician here at a children’s hospital.  I’ve spoken with some local mental health providers for kids in our sizable school district and they are even using the term PTSD to describe what occurred to kids.  There aren’t that many kids being seen in pediatric clinics for other diseases (relatively speaking), but rather most visits are now mental health, status post ending of lockdown."
2021-07-09 17:19,"In Los Angeles County, public health officials have recommended that ALL individuals wear masks indoors or outdoors in crowded areas.  This is in spite of the the CDC's recommendations saying that vaccinated individuals no longer need to wear masks.  The Delta variant is deadly and there have been at least 4,000 cases of breakthrough infections in vaccinated individuals which resulted in hospitalization or death.  Of that approximate 4,000, at least 600 vaccinated individuals have died from the Delta variant specifically according to recent CDC data.  And this is an underestimate.  While from a public health perspective, these are minimal numbers, they are still human lives.  Mandatory masking should continue in schools at this time.  The virus is not yet under control."
2021-07-09 17:21,"What, exactly, do “unable” and  “fully reopen” mean?  

I fear that schools may misinterpret or misapply the terms “unable” and “fully” as a way to skirt sound safety measures and save a buck.

And that measures such as wearing masks and having adequate ventilation and air purification are now only “guidance” and not requirements leaves us apprehensive about sending 11 year-olds (who don’t have even the option to be covid19 vaccinated) to middle schools, where they must mingle and dine with the other 2/3 of the student body who may or may not be vaccinated.  Without school requirements of verifiable proof of full Covid vaccination from all and students and staff (and vigilant mask monitoring), and/or blanket mask mandates, schools and the CDC may be throwing 6th graders and their families under the bus.  Shameful."

The challenge will be convincing two generations of parents raised on safetyism and knee pads and wrist guards for tricyclists to send their kids back."
2021-07-09 17:30,"I just read the public-facing CDC page -- while the CDC nods toward the importance of in-person learning, it still hasn't really explicitly weighed the costs and benefits of in-person vs distance learning. Covid presents a low personal risk to each child, comparable to other diseases we live with, and children don't seem to transmit it as well to each other either; on the other side of the ledger, the health costs of home learning to children have been staggering. For example, the rate of new pediatric Type 2 diagnoses almost doubled last year, which is astounding! While I think the new recommendations are sensible, I wish the CDC had showed its work more, so that this debate isn't just about minimizing covid spread among children but about all the knock-on health effects to children of keeping them out of school."
2021-07-09 17:30,"If they would just approve the vaccines for school-aged children under 12, this would all be moot. Back to normal, (almost) everywhere. I have no idea why they haven't yet, or why the vaccines still haven't received full FDA approval. What further evidence needs to be collected to prove their safety and efficacy... we, the vaccinated, ARE the study, and we've proven that they're safe and that they work extremely well."
2021-07-09 17:34,"This is the first I've heard of the new recommended school guidelines and I appreciate the news coverage. But where is the news coverage and pressure on the pharma companies to roll out the vaccine for children? 
We need the NYT to continue to cover the news and timeline on the next roll out so these kids can get vaccinated and back to life as we once knew it."
2021-07-09 17:37,"CDC is not only sending mixed signals but also being cavalier. They could have waited till they have more data on the impact of Delta variant given the latest findings in Israel.  Not sure what's the rush, is wearing mask for little longer going to kill more folks than not wearing?

Scientific community is struggling to understand the impact of mutations and is still learning pretty much everyday. I fail to understand the need for this premature chest-thumping by CDC. Does the cost of not learning for a year or two  outweigh the loss of a young life? One can't learn when is not around."
2021-07-09 17:40,"It is SO wonderful to read all the anti-teacher comments. I'm assuming those posters didn't learn anything from teachers. I'm assuming they somehow got the education they needed for the positions they hold without teachers. 

Well, I didn't. My teachers and profs K-grad school have helped me become the person I am. I realize that I owe my career in large part to my teachers. 

Thank you to teachers everywhere. We don't pay you what you're worth. We don't give you the respect you deserve. We endanger you because we refuse to enact reasonable gun control to help prevent school shootings. Now we are exposing you to an illness that vaccines are not 100% effective against. We value people who play stupid games more than we value the people who help us raise our kids, and there is something REALLY messed up about that. Be careful. Take care of yourselves."
2021-07-09 17:48,"Kids weren't made to sitting in front of a computer screen and focus on learning for 6 hours! Children need to interact with others and run around on the playground! My last year in college was one of the hardest things I done academically and my motivation to learn was very low. I cannot imagine the stress K-12 students felt sitting in front of a screen and without having actual human interactions. Let school staff,teachers and students wear masks and alternate between in-person and zoom sessions."
2021-07-09 17:48,"We should seriously consider removing children from the homes of parents who will not send them to school or, when vaccines are available, will not have them vaccinated. It's tantamount to child abuse."
2021-07-09 17:49,"At this point, that this is even up for debate is remarkable. Most teachers I know, like my daughter in the public school system, are fully vaccinated, and eager to get back in front of their classrooms. Unfortunately they face a formidable foe, their own teachers' unions, backed by the full faith and credit of the Democratic party. 

The isolation, depression, and other myriad mental health issues posed to kids as a result of remote ""learning"" far outweigh any risks of Covid itself. Never mind the fact that they aren't learning much to speak of, toss in the economic hit and other disruptions to a household of young children with working parents, and you can see why so many of us are just shaking our heads at this.

There will ultimately be a political price to pay for this, and it's not hard to see what party is going to have significant losses."
2021-07-09 17:52,"If you are eligible to be vaccinated and have no medical reason not to be, you are part of the problem. Absent medical reasons, there is no good reason for anyone 12 and older not to be vaccinated. And if everyone who is eligible and medical able were vaccinated, this story would not even be news. It would be taken for granted weeks ago that in-person school would be open. I’ve had it with the anti-vaxxers damaging their communities."
2021-07-09 17:57,"Emily Oyster needs to stay in her lane. She has done enormous damage to this debate, for which she has no credentials to even participate."
2021-07-09 18:02,"The low risk of covid to children is worth it for the massive benefits that in person education provides. Most kids already lost 1 and a half years of school, we can’t have them fall behind even further."
2021-07-09 18:03,"Why is it that parents don’t have a say in local health department rules. If an unvaccinated teacher comes to work and exposes my unvaccinated child, then my child has to quarantine, regardless of the low risk of severe illness for her? Poll families and ask them if they’d be willing to take the risk of sending their children after a so-called “exposure” from 3-6 ft. I guarantee the majority of parents would prefer to end these strict quarantine measures and send their kids to school. Mental, social and psychological development are equally important and endless quarantines and distancing have very tough consequences on our children. Just visit a local pediatric ER and see for yourself."
2021-07-09 18:05,"When it comes to dealing with the COVID-19 aka novel coronavirus-19 aka SARS-2 aka COV-SARS-2 pandemic the C,D.C,of Trump era Robert Redfield had no more scientific credibility than Biden era C.D C..chief Rachelle Walensky has.

They both keep playing too much politics.

Moreover,  public school education is primarily a local and state governing power and privilege.

Joe Biden is not the head of American local  public school boards.  And the Secretary of Education is not the Superintendent of American Public Schools.  While the head of the C.D.C. is not the American local public school official head health honcho.

We know that masks and social distancing worlk.  We know on- line learning is separate and unequal. We know that 56% of Americans are not fully vaccinated. We know kids under 12 are not vaccinated at all."
2021-07-09 18:11,"Yes.  Students benefit most from in-person learning.  Vaccines provide reliable protection and kids cannot lose another year away from peers, teachers, and school personnel."
2021-07-09 18:13,"I have zero trust in the CDC since it have lifted indoor masking mandates without a vaccine verification mechanism. It's not about protecting those who are vaccinated, although it's unknown whether breakthrough mild cases can have long haul effects. It's about preventing the unvaccinated from spreading a viral load in indoor places that allows the virus to mutate to a variant that will eventually evade the vaccine. That's how science works. Every Corona mutation has strengthened it and allowed it to spread more easily. 

So now, who will check whether students and staff are vaccinated? Masks should be mandated for everyone, not just the unvaccinated. If everyone is back, how can teachers maintain six feet away from the students? 

I teach high school in a high poverty low vaccinated area in the Bronx. We already had lots of cases when most students were remote. 

The CDC ""guidance"" makes no sense, and seems to be politically motivated, especially given delta. I am profoundly disappointed as I had anticipated an improvement after Trump."
2021-07-09 18:15,"Everyone should look into the harmful effects of Screen Addiction on developing brains. I had to write an educational psychology paper on this subject, and it amazed me when I discovered that the rise of mental disorders in kids is directly linked to lack of tangible, real-world stimuli in the learning process. At first, this field was limited to video game addiction, tv addiction, and computer addiction, but with the rise of e-learning, studies have shown that when you let screens take the place of the traditional in-person teaching-learning model, some terrible things happen to growing brains. They can fall down a cyber rabbit hole and some don’t come back out without intensive therapy. Have to wonder how many kids fell down it during the pandemic."
2021-07-09 18:22,"In the last week or so, the numbers have turned around, I suspect because of the widespread belief that the “crisis” is over.
Time to go back - at least to masks for everyone - including kids - before the current increases become the Next Spike"
2021-07-09 18:30,"Covid vaccines should be required for all eligible students and staff, as are other required vaccinations. Period."
2021-07-09 18:31,"And how will schools know who has been vaccinated and who has not? Given that going back in person seems both important for individual students and the community as a whole, it seems that this directive should include giving schools the right to mandate vaccination (as they already do with other types of illness)."
2021-07-09 18:32,"Pfizer trials in children less than 12 are going on now. If it works out, the younger kids will need to mask for a couple of months more max. The outrage over the changing situation is laughable. Viruses mutate. Things change EVERY DAY. The science is always behind conditions on the ground so it's smart to err on the side of caution. I'm not a teacher but my union and employer negotiated a vaccine mandate for us. I don't have all the details yet, so I don't know the protocol for any medical or religious exemptions. There is a lot of aerosol generation in my profession so there could be more frequent testing required, or double masking for some, or perhaps unvaccinated will be reassigned or paid a percentage of their salary to stay home. Vaccinated people are tested every week, and antibody testing will be added in the coming months."
2021-07-09 18:32,"Did you like school?  I didn't.  As matter fact, I really disliked it.  And this is true for a lot of kids￼.  There are good reasons why children feel this way.  But we are ignoring them in our rush to return to ""normal.""

There are studies that suggest a significant number of children suffer while they are in schools, e.g., suicides and suicidal ideation increase for kids during the school year. <a href=""https://upnight.com/2021/02/23/warning-schools-can-be-hazardous-to-health-and-happiness-dont-rush-to-send-your-kids-back"" target=""_blank"">https://upnight.com/2021/02/23/warning-schools-can-be-hazardous-to-health-and-happiness-dont-rush-to-send-your-kids-back</a>/  No one wants to talk about this.  We can't wait to get the kids back in school, even if Delta may mean heightened risks to communities.  

We are too ready to jump to conclusions based on prior assumptions, e.g., kids are stressed because they are not in school.  But where are the studies that differentiate the stress that kids have experienced because of the situations of their parents and country during the pandemic vs. not being in school?  

We are uncritically accepting the notion that schools are good for kids without paying attention to how many children suffer because of them.  And this is often self-serving.  We adults want, no deserve, a return to ""normal."""
2021-07-09 18:34,"This update from the CDC is actually important because it empowers schools (including my son's NYC public school) to say ""we're following the CDC guidance and we're still reopening event even though we're not quite able to meet the 3 foot rule"".

This was a known barrier that many NYC public schools wouldn't quite be able to meet the 3 foot guidance, but they had promised everyone that they'd follow CDC guidance.  Now they can move forwards and reopen."
2021-07-09 18:36,"One expert is disappointed that guidelines are left flexible. 

There are no guidelines that are perfectly safe. In a community of unvaccinated elderly people living in close multigenerational households, separation and masks might be useless. In an area with high vaccination rates and low transmission, masks might be perfectly effective. 

The burden for community protection and safe schooling lies with adults. Get vaccinated and vaccinate your children when you can."
2021-07-09 18:39,"it continues to call for teachers and other staff members to remain at least six feet away from students regardless of their vaccination status — and if they are unvaccinated, six feet away from one another.

This is crazy and has to change. You don’t have the data? Then start studying it.  I was an in-person first grade teacher all of last year. This guidance is impossible and it’s not happening. I can’t teach effectively if I’m six feet away from a student. Not one kid in my class got Covid and neither did I."
2021-07-09 18:46,"As usual, CDC ""guidance"" creates confusion and difficult choices for parents.
All adults need to keep a close eye on vaccination levels and infection levels in their location. 

Ask what plan your school board has for testing symptomatic students.  When is a  cold not a cold?  Are they willing to send children with sniffles home or isolate them at school?

Where vaccination rates are low (under 50%), masks continue to be an essential tool.

Vaccine = 90% effective against Delta.
Vaccine + medical grade mask = 99.9% effective.

My mask is my seat belt.  My vaccination is my airbag.  Protected by both.
Don't be the last person to die in this war, or be disabled by long-haul Covid."
2021-07-09 18:56,"During WWII, Britain closed most of its schools for years. Part of the solution was to evacuate children from the cities to safer outlying areas. But as you might imagine, evacuation was easier said than done, especially for working class families. 

British kids suffered more in the short run. But the 1944 Education Act extended free public education to all secondary schools so that those harmed were remedied. 

Maybe we could pass an education bill ourselves. No, no forget it, it makes too much sense."
2021-07-09 19:00,"Two thoughts

Republicans continuing to refuse vaccinations could ruin this and put us right back where we were, with our kids trying to learn through a screen

Learning with a teacher in a classroom is clearly the best way to learn. We need to invest heavily in recruiting and retaining teachers. Decades of Republican attacks on teachers has created a national teacher shortage. We need to fix that."
2021-07-09 19:04,"Where is the data on the impact of mask-wearing on learning, social development, relationship-building, joy in the classroom, psychological health, etc? Masks are effective in preventing the spread of COVID, but they have other impacts and as an educator, I wish this were more studied and discussed."
2021-07-09 19:11,"One big missing factor in all of this. I have a 2nd grader. My school district here in San Diego county sent an email out saying masks and social distancing are not required outside of the classroom, i.e. while required in the class, they can expect not to eat masks or social distance on the playground during recess.

That really makes no sense. With this rule my daughter can get close to an unvaccinated child who has the virus on the playground and be breathed or sneezed on. Or a kid who just wiped his nose on his hands uses the monkey bars, and my kid follows. Needless to say, I’ll be ordering my kid to wear a mask at all times, and social distance. But the cdc should have said the same.

My thinking is you have to be all in on protection, or just don’t bother. Not sure how the scientists at CDC missed this - kids on a playground will transmit this virus just as easily as indoors unmasked and not distanced given the nature of how kids to play close together, and are generally not careful with hygiene (as any parent who has caught what their kid has brought home from school well knows). 

I’m also wondering how I as a parent can be assured the teacher actually got vaccinated. Though, if I were teaching, I’d be sure to protect myself, but there will be a few who lie about it or claim some kind of religious exception."
2021-07-09 19:11,"Eric Feigl-Ding is a good person to read on covid in general. 

His bona fides are impeccable. It would be nice to hear other opinions in the Times.

2021-07-09 19:13,"An educational loss because of virtual learning is much less than a real loss from the death of a child.  Out of one side of their mouth, they say the Delta variant is bad, but yet say it is safe for young children still not approved for the vaccine to attend school.  I sort of smell some politics here now.  Even this morning CDC and Pfizer are disagreeing on whether a 3rd vaccination is necessary.  Moderna says they think a 3rd vaccination will be necessary.  CDC has had to backtrack several times are more information is available.  I don't think their information is deliberately wrong, but I take issue with some of the things they are stating.  I suspect that a manufacturer of a vaccine knows more about it than the CDC, but then there is a financial benefit for a 3rd vaccination.  Lots of somewhat conflicting information here."
2021-07-09 19:20,Good luck with that. I predict schools will close again as Delta will spread rapidly among the student population. Let's not forget that you can still get COVID while vaccinated. Vaccination should be mandatory.
2021-07-09 19:50,"The new guidance includes ""Localities should monitor community transmission, vaccination coverage, screening testing, and occurrence of outbreaks to guide decisions on the level of layered prevention strategies (e.g., physical distancing, screening testing).""

It lacks any guidance as to what levels of transmission, vaccination coverage, screening testing, and occurrence of outbreaks"" would require a school or district to temporarily return to distance learning. So, the CDC has once again opted to provide general feel-good ""guidance"" without any details."
2021-07-09 19:51,"In the event the delta variant doesn’t burn wildly through the unvaccinated, and break through to too many of the vaccinated, thus throwing the fall school year into crisis, IMHO this is a sensible approach all educational interests should generally work toward. Even with “mandatory” vaccinations, there will always be unvaccinated people in schools. Now the CDC, of course, has to resist the pressures that often seem to make it swerve off course."
2021-07-09 19:53,"The 14,000 ""locally controlled"" school districts in America and each of their teacher unions are hopelessly bureaucratic institutions stuck in the 19th century. Not to mention they are obsessed with ""local control"" which is a low key way of saying ""we'll do what we please with no accountability to anyone at all"". Even now the state of California is still demanding that ALL students wear masks, no matter their vaccine status, because schools are too lazy to implement more nuanced rules. And these are the same people in charge of educating the nation's children. For shame."
2021-07-09 20:00,"Sadly, what parents want for their kids, what school boards want and what the science indicates as prudent  just don't matter. Such matters will be determined by Teacher Unions alone. The pandemic enabled them to consolidate even more political advantage and influence."
2021-07-09 20:02,"Here's an idea that just might work: 
Welcome all children back to school, and provide ample opportunities to socialize outdoors, or anywhere there is ample ventilation. 
Indoors, require face masks when the local positive test rate exceeds n%. [""n"" would be determined by the CDC.] 
Provide separate classrooms for children whose household members are fully vaccinated.
Allow parents to refuse to disclose whether or not they have been vaccinated, and presume that they have not been. 

This might seem discriminatory, or infringing on the ""rights"" of vaccine or Covid deniers. However, choices do have consequences, and those who refuse to get vaccinated aren't a protected class. 

Presumably, adults with immunodeficiency are being very careful. They should be allowed to choose in which classrooms their children spend the day. 

It is definitely in the best interest of children to allow them to return to school, and to socialize with their peers. This might strike a middle ground, while keeping [almost] everyone healthy and avoiding future shutdowns."
2021-07-09 20:08,"I am just puzzled why vaccinations aren't required. We have no issues poking our legislative nose into the personal choices of women, why not when it involves the well-being of an entire nation?"
2021-07-09 20:18,"I live in a Republican strong-hold state, so I'm not sure my elementary-age child will be at a school that is even allowed to mandate masks.  I'm vaccinated, and I plan to get my child vaccinated as soon as he is eligible.  But I am very uncomfortable with him going to a school where they aren't going to social distance or wear masks.  At least until the elementary-age kids are protected via vaccine.  Of course, I will tell my kid to wear one, but what a burden to place on a young kid to be responsible as an individual vs just requiring all the kids and teachers to mask up while in the classroom."
2021-07-09 20:46,"In the very important discussions and reports on Delta, other variants, and the general increase in cases in the US, I believe it would be interesting to your readers to see an ongoing set of graphics that fully separate vaccinated from unvaccinated individuals in terms of these cases and increases."
2021-07-09 20:51,"They had better be checking vaccination status or people will just lie and say their kids have had it.  They do not care about other people.  Clearly many unvaccinated people in my state are going without masks, you see whole families, little kids included, in the grocery store unmasked.  They are making life so much less safe for the immunosuppressed who now must assume everyone is unvaccinated."
2021-07-09 21:07,"Think about this: we are vaccinating the group most likely to have symptoms of COVID (older people) and leaving exposed the group least likely to have symptoms - children. This means that the virus may well spread extensively among children without any signs that would alert us, since in most cases no symptoms = no testing = no awareness of the spread. Add to this the possibility of long-term effects of COVID in asymptomatic cases and we might be putting our kids at real risk, given that their bodies often don't show us they have been infected until the damage is done. I say let's keep the masks on."
2021-07-09 21:36,"""The agency also called on school districts to use local health data to guide decisions about when to tighten or relax prevention measures like mask wearing and physical distancing.""

Tragically, Republican controlled state legislature across this great land have forbid school districts to implement known preventive measures - like mask-wearing - lest they violate the individual rights of students.... to infect others!"
2021-07-09 21:38,"As usual the comments are priceless.
Whole bunch of people out there that want you to wear a mask everyday for the rest of your life."
2021-07-09 21:58,"Well, this is the C.D.C.'s current position.  It's only early July.  A lot can happen between now and the middle of August."
2021-07-09 22:00,"Wow, the teacher-haters are out in full force.  Schools need to be safe for everyone involved. Guess what?  Kids don't teach themselves.  There are adults dedicated to teaching them.  There are paraprofessionals helping them.  School employees making sure the school runs.  Those adults have lives that matter.  The Covid vaccine should be required for everyone eligible, adult and child, in schools. And schools should be ventilated, cleaned, and generally speaking a safe place to be in every way. But as a 22 year public school teaching veteran, let me tell you that is not the case. No other professional would work in the conditions that teachers do.  Mold in classrooms.  Outdated, musty ventilation systems.  Overcrowding. Filthy bathrooms and cafeterias.  No air-conditioning. Pre WWII mismatched, donated desks and filing cabinets.  And I teach in a wealthy district.  I think if most parents saw the conditions in which teachers work, they would be appalled.  Long before Covid, I began showering every day after school because I feel so filthy from the building at the end of the day. Make schools safe, and we will all gladly return in person.  That includes masks for the unvaccinated, mandatory vaccinations for all eligible, and a way overdue investment in the school facilities."
2021-07-09 16:12,About time. The perfect is the enemy of the good!
2021-07-09 20:39,"With week-over-week positive tests increasing--today''s NYT shows a 39% increase in positive tests from  two weeks ago--September should be smack in the middle of the next wave, thanks to all the folks who are too selfish to get vaccinated."
2021-07-09 22:10,"School will open and watch cases rise.   It will happen.   Yes shutting down in person instruction is inconvenient, last time I checked dying was worse"
2021-07-09 22:27,"COVID is never going away. It’s endemic in human populations now, and unless we build a wall around the country, and keep everyone out, it’s always going to be in our country. So what’s the solution? Close schools forever because of the tiny fraction of kids who will die from it?￼"
2021-07-09 22:29,"Uh.... sure sounds safe. The best rebuttal to this article is information from this article.  We’re all complicit in putting our kids at risk. Shame on us all.

Of note:
 
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention released new guidance on Friday urging schools to fully reopen in the fall, even if they cannot take all of the steps the agency recommends to curb the spread of the coronavirus
 
Officials said they were confident this is the correct approach, even with the spread of the highly contagious Delta variant, and the fact that children under 12 are not yet eligible for vaccination.
 
Virtual learning has been burdensome not only for students but also their parents, many of whom had to stay home to provide child care, and reopening schools is an important step on the economy’s path to recovery.
 
“Physical distancing is still a recommended strategy,” she added, but she emphasized that if schools do not have sufficient space to keep all students three feet apart, “that should not keep children out of the classroom in the fall.”"
2021-07-09 22:32,"People!  If you want kids back in school, we need to wear masks and get vaccinated NOW.  Spiking cases just before school is going to ensure that we do another remote year and many of us lose the jobs we just got back."
2021-07-09 22:33,"Here in Los Angeles, I have a tough time believing that public school teachers will go into a classroom full of kids who are not vaccinated. Third of all teachers in Los Angeles Unified School District are over the age of 50. If forced to go back to the classroom, I'd imagine that 20 percent of the teachers will quit or resign. Despite the fact that Los Angeles exceeds the national rate of vaccination, a staggering 31 percent of eligible people have not received their first shot. With the delta variant spreading out of control, I think we're looking at another academic year of hybrid and at-home learning. C.D.C., LAUSD, and other entities can plan and urge all they want. Once a teacher dies from her job, these plans will fall apart from the glare of media attention and call for accountability."
2021-07-09 22:33,"This really doesn’t say anything other than that each school district is basically on its own in terms of protocols… Disappointing. I think the prudent thing to do is require masking indoors, especially for children under 12 for whom there is not yet a vaccine. Teachers (and more recently students 12 and up) have been eligible for vaccines for quite some time. At this point, we in the U.S. should be able to move on from a doomsday scenario - we know how to reduce transmission; we have good quality vaccines available for the majority of people so we need to turn our attention to getting children back in school. The past year and a half of remote school during this crisis has done a lot of damage to children - academically and psychologically and we need to turn our resources to this unfolding disaster."
2021-07-09 22:34,"The CDC can give ""guidance"" but it carries no authority in public, private law, or in any other jurisdiction that could affect institutions. The CDC may issue various effective dicta which however are not binding."
2021-07-09 22:42,"This admin and its CDC seems to be projecting an idealistic ""America"" that does not exist in reality."
2021-07-09 22:44,"Biden could increase the vaccination rate in the lagging-behind red states like Mississippi and Alabama by mandating that if your school’s staff is 100% vaccinated, your school will be eligible for additional federal funding. Like a Christmas bonus. Doesn’t have to be a huge sum, just something better than the Jelly of the Month Club. In rural areas, school systems are often the county’s largest employer. Giving extra federal money to schools who have everyone on staff vaccinated would help these communities in more ways than one."

2021-07-09 18:48,"The undercurrent of judgement against CDCs past recommendations is unfair. Yes, now we see kids transmit less and get less sick. But this wasn't at all clear earlier on. Imagine if COVID was like the flu and easily spread by kids. Stop the cheap shot, Monday morning quarterbacking."
2021-07-09 22:19,"Cue the parents losing their minds about their unvaccinated kids being ""discriminated against"" because they still have to wear masks and quarantine..."
2021-07-09 22:36,Good luck with this. Israel’s recents Covid outbreaks started in schools.
2021-07-09 23:33,I wish the state of California bothered to follow the CDC guidance. It has just been mandated that ALL teachers and students k-12-- even those who are vaccinated and in high schools that are 90% plus vaccinated-- will need to wear masks in the fall. I have a hearing impaired child who has struggled to learn via zoom and with masking. She and the vast majority of her high school classmates are vaccinated. Why should her right to learn and fully access the school curriculum be less important than the rights of unvaccinated high school students? Why are we catering to those who refuse to help themselves?
2021-07-09 23:39,"I taught first grade in person all year.  The younger students adjusted to masks very well.  I had no trouble with compliance.  It will not be a problem for them to wear masks a few more months.  For teens and tweens, not having to wear a mask at school will be a huge incentive to get vaccinated before school begins.  They had more trouble adjusting to the masks."
2021-07-09 23:47,I sympathize with my students and I wish there was more mention made on the strain of teachers over the past year. I have been a middle school science teacher for 35 years and I have never had to work so hard. I find myself both physically and emotionally exhausted. The school I work at is going back full time and is committed to no classes being held remotely and I can't be happier.
2021-07-10 0:04,"At least some prepublished data out of the UK show a much higher prevalence in unvaccinated children and increased hospitalizations in this group.  This is suspected to be driven by the delta variant, and represents data collected may-June of his year.  So why exactly are we picking now to open up? Couldn’t we wait the suspected few more weeks till all school aged kids are expected to be offered the vaccine?"

2021-07-10 0:58,"In the Bay Area the media was pretty one-sided on the school issue, generally demonizing the teachers’ unions and ‘standing up’ for parents of underrepresented groups whose kids were suffering the most.

Turns out it was mostly a loud minority of rich white parents who wanted their kids out of their hair so they could focus on high-powered zoom calls. Underrepresented groups were generally supportive of remote learning in polls.

Meanwhile the teachers were portrayed as selfish because they refused to be guinea pigs. Pretty much anyone who could work remotely was allowed to, but they needed to go back to in person prematurely. This was particularly tragic because the hybrid options presented further disrupted an already messy year, all with a vaccine in sight. What a waste."

People who are fully vaccinated can resume activities that they did prior to the pandemic. Learn more about what you and your child or teen can do when you have been fully vaccinated. Children 12 years and older are able to get the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine.""

It is beyond me why Covid vaccines cannot be required for all eligible children, teachers and support staff—as they are for a roster of other childhood diseases—who wish to attend public school, or work there.

As a child, I had to be vaccinated for a number of childhood diseases, if not previously infected and naturally immune, before I could attend school. 

What has changed? Apparently a small minority of anti-vaxxers are allowed to dictate public policy. The majority of taxpayers  who find that unacceptable need to speak out."

2021-07-10 4:11,California is going to require masks in schools this fall. The rationale is that they don't want kids who haven't been vaccinated to feel ostracized. This is the most absurd thing I've heard in a while as the solution is to require all children to be vaccinated if their parents want them enrolled. This is a straight pandering to the anti-vaxxer crowd and as a teacher I find it appalling.
2021-07-10 4:54,"I am in a county with a low vaccination rate, where masking is not the norm, Our state legislature has already made it illegal to add any new vaccines to the list required for schools.

When we brought all of the kids back at the end of the year, masking was still mandated but more than half of the boys refused to wear their masks over their noses. It was a farce. With the Delta variant, we are going to have a tragic school year if masks are no longer required. Yeah, kids are going to hold to that honor system. We are seeing how well that’s working in people who are supposed to be adults.  The pandemic is not over and, because so many people are trusting sources of disinformation regarding vaccination, it will likely never end."
2021-07-10 10:12,As a substitute teacher this past spring it's imperative the kids go back fully in the fall for in person learning. The hybrid model to me didn't work. The kids seemed to be more engaged when I was with them.

I mean, people died last week in LA from overdoses than died of covid. Plus, Im 33 and unvaccinated. Ive traveled to Detroit, Portland, and Nashville in the last three weeks and interacted with hundreds of people. Im not afraid of covid and it doesnt affect how I live my life. If you are scared or old or have some condition then get the vaccine. For all the rest of us, let us be. I dont live in some communitarian society and I have the right to live how I want to in America. There is nothing wrong with that. In fact, I believe id rather live this way than under some Chinese system where I rely on government to be my mommy and dont get to have individual choice."
2021-07-09 17:36,"It’s dismaying to me to see so many of my fellow liberals lose their minds over kids and covid. The panic I see in these comments shows how thoroughly we’ve exaggerated the risks of covid to kids.

 Covid swept through our colleges and universities and their communities last year yet even now with the assurance of vaccines these same states among others, have few if any colleges and universities requiring vaccination. 
 As a parent that lack would weigh heavily on any decision to support a child's education in a school so unconcerned with their students and community's welfare."

1. Everyone over 12 who wants a vaccine can get one.
2. Any one  under 18 (realistically, under 30) is at such low risk from severe illness that there are many many other things they should be worrying about. For example, a UK study of 469,982 kids found a survival rate of 99.995%!

That leaves the immunocompromised. But these people have been at risk from all kinds of illnesses. And any benefit we may derive at that end needs to be weighed against the enormous damage we are doing to our kids mental and physical health through closing schools.

I'm afraid that some teachers unions and some folks here are looking for ever more far fetched reasons to keep schools closed. I'd like to think most Americans are more rational."

It is not obvious that the FDA will — or should — grant emergency use authorization to vaccinate kids under 12 later this year.  Then what?  Are younger kids, for whom the risk of COVID is lowest, going to be masked and distanced and tested in perpetuity?  If we’re not dropping these restrictions now when hospitalization and death numbers (the key metrics) have plummeted, when does this end?  COVID is not going to be eradicated; with the miracle of vaccines it has become and will continue to be a managed and controlled risk that we will need to learn to live with and not fear, just like the risks of drowning or car crashes for kids as other commenters have noted."
2021-07-09 17:17,"I am disgusted with the CDC.  Yes, the majority of children in the US (and their parents & families) would prefer that their children attend school in a classroom setting.  Yes, we are all stressed and working hard to make life ""as normal as possible"" but returning to the classroom is not the solution BECAUSE:  The Delta Variant is active & increasing in many areas throughout the United States.  A major reason this has happened is because too many people refused to get vaccinated.  They didn't have to pay... medical teams allover the country continue to work tirelessly to vaccinate people all over this country.  There are many states in this country where teachers and educational assistants are not required to get vaccinated and refuse to do so.  If you think life is stressful now... let's see what life is like after Labor Day and our hospitals are once again full because too many people in this country DIDN'T listen to the majority of scientists, epidemiologists and medical professionals who were saying... get VACCINATED.  Your 5 year old may not contract the virus but teenagers and young adults all over this country are vulnerable.  WAKE UP AMERICA!   People should be forced to watch videos of  Americans of all ages... in their last moments of life as they struggle to breathe as they succumb to this virus.  On line education is not ideal but it protects life."
2021-07-09 17:30,"I asked a late friend once if adults freaked out over measles when she was a kid.  I told her that where I lived, families would even bring healthy kids around the sick ones so we could all just get measles and get on with school.  It was the 60's and literally every human I ever knew there had measles, mumps, and chickenpox by the fifth grade.  It was our rite of passage.  

She said that they did the same thing in her country (Samoa).  ""Head lice, now THAT freaked the adults out"", she said as we both laughed.  

If I still had school aged children, I would be more concerned about head lice, unwanted pregnancies, and guns in school at this point than COVID.  In my day, the first thing we did after the Pledge of Allegiance and the Lord's Prayer was practice Duck and Cover.  There is still no vaccine for nukes.  

One can always home school and I have a nice desk you can borrow.  I quit crawling underneath it long, long ago which was one of the more important lessons I learned in school."
2021-07-09 18:05,"It's embarrassing to see teachers still acting as though they are victimized by this policy. 

There is ample research now showing that teachers faced no higher risk than other workers during the pandemic, including remote workers. Teachers were prioritized for vaccines over these groups, and the vaccines are extremely effective at protecting them.

It really seems that some teachers have embraced an exaggerated view of the risks posed by children and by their occupation."
2021-07-09 23:10,"Unfortunately the teachers unions will be the biggest obstacle to reopening schools, no matter what the CDC says the unions will fight it so their members can continue to stay home, they only pretend to care about the children during contract talks."
2021-07-09 23:17,It is quite simple. Teachers and parents have had more than enough time to get vaccinated. Children are at very low risk of health complications from COVID. They are at greater risk of mental health issues from extended stays at home. Get back to in person learning.
2021-07-10 2:00,"Folks,

There are real costs to remote learning. Certainly, social and emotional costs are real. Additionally, immunity debt is real too. Children are being hospitalized in large numbers with flu and RSV (including our 4 year old). The risk of COVID in the below 12 age group is incredibly small. It is time to recognize that the risk of no childhood greatly exceeds the risk of COVID in this age group.

With this in mind, the CDC guidelines are better. But, it is time to bring school back to normal. Our kids will be healthier for it."
2021-07-10 14:21,"4 million children have tested positive for Covid-19. The current CDC Director has a platinum gold education in medicine. Doctors, medical leaders, and all professionals need also to have common sense, good judgement, and wisdom. Earlier CDC recommended reopening the schools before teachers could be safely vaccinated; an earlier wind-tunnel study showed the virus can travel indoors as far as 21 feet; parents and children should have the option of their child repeating their current grade level of school - this is not as bad as it sounds - it may be disruptive of some peer relationships; schools could offer different classrooms for vaccinated and unvaccinated students above the age of 12; the CDC Director may want to recuse herself from decisions about managing Covid in the schools since she has school age children which may make it hard for her to look evenly at all sides of this quixotic issue. Yes, children need to be back in school - but safely."
2021-07-10 16:07,"Once again, with the school guidance, the CDC has capitulated to the pandemic deniers, anti-maskers and the anti-vaxxers, and thereby abdicated their responsibility for public health.  Of course the goal should be (and always has been) to fully re-open schools.  But the primary obstacle to doing so safely lies with the people who haven’t followed the public health guidelines and, now, aren’t getting vaccinated, along with the public officials who have encouraged defiance of public health measures.  The CDC guidance should clearly recognize that fact, for instance that opening schools with nearly complete safely is a readily achievable goal to the degree that everyone who is qualified to get vaccinated gets vaccinated.  Instead it urges opening the schools with guidelines that are so flexible they aren’t guidelines at all.  It will continue to be up to the responsible people to try to protect the community against the irresponsible people, with no real guidelines to back up the hard decisions they have to make under the conditions they are dealing with."
2021-07-10 17:25,"These comments are madness. The WHO recommends against masks for under 12 even where vaccines aren’t available. The vaccines failed to get emergency approval in Europe for 12-16 because COVID doesn’t constitute an emergency for that age group (exceptions are to be made for at risk kids per their doctor). An EUA here for 5-11 id total madness and we should be ashamed of ourselves morally vaccinating kids while high risk adults elsewhere don’t have access and tens of thousands are trapped out of closed borders. 

This comment surely won’t be published but this entire comment section is appalling. My more conservative friends have been warning about this holding kids hostage for vaccination rates and dragging this out with endless fear over variants and case counts. I thought they were completely nuts. Clearly, they were right. 

Schools should be fully open like 2019 and failure to do will ensure the backlash at the voter booth. Happily voted for Adams and will vote for any reasonable moderate Republican governor and likely for Ron DeSantis in 2024 if this nonsense continues. This is complete madness at this point, and can never be allowed to happen again."

2021-07-10 19:43,"Schools and in-person classes must reopen. But caution and vaccination are a must.

It is very very hard to understand why there is so much push-back against mass vaccination. For this issue, the solution is quite simple. It's OK, really OK, to have the choice and make the personal decision to get vaccinated. Totally fine really. BUT if one chooses not to get vaccinated, one will be denied health coverage and will need to pay for their care if one gets sick from COVID. It's simply assuming the consequences of one's decision.

I am vaccinated and still wear a mask indoor, though not at home. I am for the liberty of choice and free will for everybody. I still don't want to pay for people who are stubborn enough to avoid vaccination and will cost health insurance tens of thousands in expensive ICU care, leading to a serious increase in premiums.

The explanation towards the end of the article, about what the ""Rights"" are, clears it up about as well as you can.  Bravo for that!

I've received my vaccines, lived like a hermit and dutifully wore my mask for over a year, but I am done worrying about COVID-19. Moving on to global warming, dissolution of the republic, and the impending alien invasion as news of which to be terrified."
2021-07-09 10:43,"I was vaccinated with the Pfizer vaccine and I will take the booster or a JNJ shot or whatever is recommended.

The only people hospitalized with covid today are the unvaccinated.  The vaccine works- period-full stop."
2021-07-09 10:44,"I'm surprised that it's taken the Delta variant to prompt work to develop a booster as I thought work on a booster was already ongoing. Even without the variant, a booster was likely necessary for something like this."
2021-07-09 10:45,Tell me the downside of taking a booster- even if I have to pay for it. Check please.
2021-07-09 10:53,"Such hysteria about Delta. Largely this is fueled by half-baked news stories. Journalists always jump on news that sounds threatening or bad as opposed to good news (this has been often proven). The fact is that variants are a normal part of a viral cycle, but also that the vaccines work against variants too. Just get vaccinated folks, and stop worrying about it."
2021-07-09 10:54,"Sounds like a ploy to make even more profit than they already have. Let's not forget Pfizer posted multi-billion dollar profits last quarter because of nations buying the vaccine.

Greed is a virus."
2021-07-09 10:56,the only way anyone should take this is if Pfizer makes it available at cost.
2021-07-09 10:59,There they go again.Cashing-in or peoples' gullibility  and the emergency.
2021-07-09 11:02,"It's a no brainer. If a booster shot becomes available it should be provided to anyone who wants it.
I assume that vaccine against covid 19 will become something like flu shots. People will need boosters every year."
2021-07-09 11:03,"Opportunistic? Perhaps. (It’s a pharmaceutical company.)

Doesn’t hurt to be prepared. Delta is not the first or last variant. So far the protection has been excellent. So far it’s predicted to remain that way.

Who knows what’s coming?"
2021-07-09 11:03,Pfizer needs to make a huge profit.
2021-07-09 11:06,"I assumed this was already the plan. Doctors and nurses and other health care workers were vaccinated in January. People over 65 were vaccinated in February and March. Time for boosters is now. 
Get all that refused unused vaccine from southern states and start giving boosters to those who want and need them now."
2021-07-09 11:07,"I wonder what the risks are from repeated injections of spike protein into your body.  Despite assurances that this new form of vaccine is safe, we should remember that it is still in the experimental stage and that long terms studies have not been conducted.  I certainly wouldn't give anyone, particularly a profit motivated pharmaceutical company with blanket immunity the benefit of the doubt.  Honest research needs to be performed and fully disclosed.  That is the only way that confidence and trust in this new vaccine will ever be achieved."
2021-07-09 11:08,"People in red states refuse to even get the first vaccine dose so a booster is out of the question for them. It's time for Congress to impose a tax penalty on those who refuse the Covid vaccine. Private insurers should be able to levy a surcharge similar to tobacco on unvaccinated people in private health plans. Using the GOP mentality of ME ME ME, I don't want my tax dollars being spent on Covid Medicare patients who refuse to get vaccinated, nor should I be subject to premium increases from private insurance because insurers are paying claims for unvaccinated Covid patients."
2021-07-09 11:12,How else are we supposed to know what to do? I guess the drug companies cut out the middleman and took on a leadership role. CDC has taken a laissez fair approach and with Delta surging and as a parent of 3 children under 12 without access to a vaccine I’m left in the wilderness.
2021-07-09 11:14,The “experts” who declare there is no need for boosters are wrong! There are 12 million people who received J and J vaccine and are either completely unprotected or under protected and the CDC has released no data on which vaccines account for symptomatic breakthrough infections. They claim collectively that they all are effective and many cite the 50-60 % efficacy of the flu vaccines as the benchmark vs covid vaccines. This is flawed logic. The flu studies were done without face masks or social distancing that has been in effect when they studied the covid vaccines. The flu vaccines would be 99-100% effective if studied during the pandemic. I know of only 1 case of the flu documented in my 100 + doctor group practice last flu season. My data using the recently available spike protein antibody test shows starkly different results than they are claiming. Could millions of doses of defective J and J been inadvertently sent to us? My data suggests this is possible because only 33% of J and J vaccinated had detectable antibodies vs 85 % of Pfizer and 97% of Moderna. I assume the CDC has looked at this easily testable data but I am not sure. Boosters are needed in most J and J vaccinated now. There are a significant number of 2 shot Pfizer vaccinated who need boosters also and Pfizer seems to be aware of this and likely their real rationale for a 3rd shot. My patients who received a 3rd shot of Moderna after failed response to the 2 others had a the robust/max response in 3-4wks.
2021-07-09 11:17,"We are at the beginning of a major surge again. While vaccination will protect against hospitalization and death from Delta to some degree, the vaccine is not nearly as protective as it was against the D614G variant that it was designed for.

The way out of this is crystal clear: 

1. Make vaccination a requirement for commercial flights, for entering government buildings such as the DMV, for entering public schools and universities, for hospital and nursing home employees &c. 
2. Reinstate indoor masking requirements as they did in Israel to keep transmission as low as possible. 
3. Give boosters over the fall and winter. 

Then we will can take off the masks, but

4. Continue developing boosters to new variants, as needed.

Otherwise, we will continue to be behind the curve as new variants arise and spread. We just need to get ahead of the curve, and that can simply be done by making the vaccine mandatory in as many settings as possible, which will increase vaccination rates, and requiring masks until we are there."
2021-07-09 11:18,"Mandate vaccines for school, work, private health insurance, Medicare, and Medicaid coverage. 

Allow open licensing for generic versions so that countries with vaccine producing ability can ramp up production to meet world needs. 
Otherwise the virus will continue to evolve and necessitate constant boosters… oh wait. That’s what big pharma wants."
2021-07-09 11:19,"every day we are getting severely contradictory information.  Are those of us who are fully vaxxed safe or not safe from Delta?  Is it 95% or 64%?  Maybe dont hype one ""sky is falling"" study until you get more information? And you wonder why people are still anxious?"
2021-07-09 11:21,"""Every unvaccinated person offers the virus additional opportunities to mutate into dangerous variants, Dr. Gounder noted.""

Correct.  And it is for this reason that, despite being fully vaccinated with Moderna, I will continue to wear a mask in enclosed public spaces and practice social distancing when outside of my home.  

I am in my early 60s, two years into retirement after working for more than 40 years, and I have NO intention of getting sick with Covid and risking in the slightest the possible long-term side effects of that disease because of other people's ignorance and stupidity.

The more things change, the more they stay the same. 

How true."
2021-07-09 11:22,"It is a great idea to pursue vaccines that require less often booster jabs. Covid will be around for decades before it can be eradicated, so any research that can abreviate that period should be a top priority. Politicians and end consumers have to admit that wet markets are a very significant threat to global economic security and avoid importing from countries that allow wet markets. In the end, end consumers allow China to proceed as if nothing had happened, by continuing to buy Chinese products. It is very easily possobile to avoid Chinese produce and other food products if one is determined. It is easy to avoid buying Chinese clothing. Problems only arise in the computer/high tech sector, and that is wiser policy makers need to diverse away from China. China is a top security threat, economically and health wise. Thanks to Biden, China is now officially a state of concern to NATO. Macron is wrong, dead wrong, by perceiving Russia as a more important threat."
2021-07-09 11:25,"The government should order all government employees to get the shot and all on Medicare and Social Security to get the shot immediately  or lose their payouts , jobs, and benefits. Anyone who still has not gotten a shot is going to spread the new variant. The society can not just print currency  infinitum for a few million are refusing to get vaccinated. They need to understand that their are repercussions."
2021-07-09 11:27,Unfortunately it sounds like the developing world cannot pay enough for vaccines for pharma to care about focusing their efforts there. Instead the less wealthy countries will turn into Petri dishes to create new variants while pharma focuses on making never ending booster shots for wealthy nations.
2021-07-09 11:34,"Ah Pfizer….you were doing so well until now. These latest statements about boosters seem to be more about making money. Pfizer has been profiting from their vaccine from day one whereas J&J is making no profit from their vaccine during the pandemic. Pfizer will also charge more for the booster, and it’s likely to be unnecessary."
2021-07-09 11:38,"The variants are driving the spread of the disease around the world.  There are many billions of people who, as of yet, have not received a single shot.    They form a fertile breeding ground for the next variant.  Delta is bad, but it's Epsilon or Zeta that we need to worry about.  The world must redouble its efforts to get the lower income countries vaccinated or this Covid thing will never end.

Pfizer is correct in continuing to develop new vaccines in an effort to stay ahead of the virus.   If a Delta vaccine becomes available, I'll get it.  If the scientists determine that a third shot of the original vaccine is needed instead, I'll get that shot.  But if we don't get the rest of the world vaccinated, get ready for Epsilon."
2021-07-09 11:48,The Pharma Advertising Marketing and Public Relations Departments are burning the midnight oil. Early morning meetings with sales and then on to push their scientists throughout the day. Repeat and rinse. (The greatest advertising copy ever written. Doubled shampoo sales)
2021-07-09 11:48,"First, the vaccines are effective.  Against variants.  The issue is the 6-8 month range (post vaccine).  The vaccine's efficacy drops to around 85% from around 95% (according to early studies, more to come, no doubt.)

Second, it's important to distinguish between getting the virus and experiencing disabling side effects. The vaccine is very effective against the latter.  The greatest risk is to the elderly.  They might need a boost to protect them from experiencing side effects."
2021-07-09 11:49,"Of course they will. They have to keep this money train rolling for years to come. It's all about the Benjamins. These companies are making untold billions off of this virus, At some point they figured when the regular vaccines would be enough, They'd need something else to boost profits. No pun intended. It's about profits over people."
2021-07-09 11:50,"It doesn't seem like so much trouble to get a booster shot to preserve your health.  Even if it was 2 x a year.

I got the J&J vaccine and I would love to have a booster shot.  This is so I can have the same protection everyone else has.  Why are we second best?

The article says that the pfizer doesn't need a booster.  Reason? 
 Because the study that says it is 64% is flawed and actually it is higher.  

What if it was 64%?  Would people need a booster?

Best estimates  the J&J really _is_ in the range of 60% against the delta.  

If 64% is unacceptable for people who got pfizer, why is it acceptable for people who got J&J?

 J&J needs a booster to get to the same level of protection everyone else has.  The mRNA shots will expire unused, people will get sick for no reason."
2021-07-09 11:51,"Pfizer, as referenced, in the article looks very opportunistic in marking the announcement based on unpublished Israeli data. Let be clear there is a huge financial upside to Pfizer selling booster shots. I also don’t understand why Israel is being so guarded around its unpublished data. There was published research (Nature) about 10 days ago that said the opposite to Pfizer - that the immune response was very strong after 6-8 months. I am skeptical of Pfizer and Israel’s claims at this point as it feels its premature and motivated by other reasons."
2021-07-09 11:56,"Finally the NYT mentions natural immunity, an improvement from last weeks article.
Unfortunately they just had to slip in a normative statement under a positive one.
""One dose of vaccine significantly boosted the sensitivity, suggesting that people who have recovered from Covid-19 still need to be vaccinated to fend off some variants.""

VS from the linked nature study

""Sera from convalescent patients collected up to 12 months post symptoms were 4 fold less potent against variant Delta, relative to variant Alpha
Administration of two doses generated a neutralizing response in 95% of individuals, with titers 3 to 5 fold lower against Delta than Alpha.""

I'm no math whiz but 4 fold less vs 3 to 5 fold less does not suggest that those with natural immunity need to get one dose. If both the 2 does and natural immunity are just as bad as dealing with the delta variant I'm not sure that means a jab in the arm for the latter."
2021-07-09 12:03,"It’s amazing to see how quickly Times’ readers jump on the anti-Pfizer and anti-pharma bandwagon without deeper thought. What if the new Pfizer and Israeli data are correct? And even if not, does that give us confidence another new variant won’t develop that is resistant to current vaccines? Wouldn’t it be a good idea to have companies like Pfizer experimenting more and learning how to develop variant-specific vaccines and others that may provide lasting protection?

I think back just several months ago when Pfizer, with no government assistance from Operation Warpspeed, developed and distributed its current vaccine. Then everyone was grateful. It saved millions of lives and helped us get back to a near normal existence. I tend to give such companies the benefit of the doubt until they clearly stop helping me. That point is not here yet."
2021-07-09 12:04,"Boy is this complicated! I have followed this closely in part since as a minimally immunocompromised person who has been advised by my doctor and the CDC not to have an antibody test since there is no CDC guidance on receiving a booster for the 10 million Americans like me. There is limited data that it would be helpful. Meanwhile 30% of Americans refuse or are reluctant to take any vaccines and this is delaying herd immunity and exposing neighbors, family and contacts to infection. There is no political will to impose a mandate. No one should discount the role of money in Pfizer's seeking to give a third booster. If this nation cannot manage to meet Biden's goal of 70% of adults by July 4th is it up to giving boosters to 330 million Americans? And I took note that not a single vaccine dose has been given in Haiti. Complicated!"
2021-07-09 12:06,Weird. By August there will be another new variant. And then another. Are we going to take boosters every three months? I won’t. Calm down about Delta. The current vaccine works just fine.
2021-07-09 12:07,"My partner and I have been fully vaccinated since May. We went out to a crowded bar over 4th of July weekend and both woke up this week with “colds”. Our symptoms are exactly what is being described for the delta variant. Though we haven’t been tested it’s pretty clear we got covid. We’re both young, healthy and were vaccinated with the Pfizer vaccine. I’m guessing this is spreading rampant even among fully vaccinated people. I stopped wearing a mask about a month ago but back on it goes!"
2021-07-09 12:08,"Clinical research takes time. I think it’s smart to start working on new options. I actually feel better knowing Pfizer is going to comb through the data on how the virus is evolving and try to come up with a solution. Obviously, the US government had taken the side of individualistic citizens and business owners who don’t want to follow any public health based mitigation strategies."
2021-07-09 12:08,"A news article a few days ago told that all the three approved vaccines in the US do provide long term immunity against Covid19. There are reasons why so many people loose trust on Govt and science when personal interest of ""scientists"" and greed of such companies with deep pocket influence not just scientific literature but also public policy."
2021-07-09 12:14,"I teach in a large public high school, in a red part of the state; I am fully vaccinated. Many local parents refuse to have their teens vaccinated and don't want them to wear masks either...you know, that violates their rights.

2021-07-09 12:18,"So-called experts contradict the company's findings not because they have evidence of efficacy, but because our reopening is based on vaccination only.   So, the government now appears to be a 'Pusher' peddling snake oil.   

The evidence is clear, masks and social distancing work.  Vaccines with limited studies borderline on quackery and endangers people's lives.  Desire for a pre-covid should not be the rationale to put faith in vaccines."
2021-07-09 12:19,Start sending extra doses to other countries. The US will not be rid of the virus until the whole world is rid of it. Stop hoarding booster shots that are not needed.
2021-07-09 12:23,"Hrm, I wonder why the people who sell vaccines are telling us that we need third and fourth vaccines now.

If there's data - from someone other than Pfizer - to suggest that it's a good idea, I'll get one."
2021-07-09 12:23,I seriously think that republicans work against the vaccination programs because they saw it as a stealth weapon against people they didn’t care for. Now that their base is at risk with the delta variant their minds will change slowly but they have to overcome what they have already done and said.
2021-07-09 12:24,"If we don’t focus on vaccinating the unvaccinated in America, and even more so, in the rest of the world, it’s not just Delta, but Epsilon, Zeta, Eta, etc. that will potentially create more waves of Covid infections, hospitalizations, and deaths around the world, including in America.  

Tens of millions of Americans still refuse to get effective, easily available, free vaccinations, while billions people around the world are desperate for vaccinations as Covid deaths continue - reaching 4 million total and many countries devastated by Covid right now.
We may be ready to move on from Covid in America, but SARS-CoV-2 is not done with us.

Pfizer-BioNTech at $20/dose, 2 doses, minus 94 degree F storage, was and is a vaccine for wealthy nations. I get why Pfizer-BioNTech wants to focus on market for 3rd dose/booster in wealthy nations. More revenues and profits - that’s why companies exist.

But the US should focus on getting the Janssen (Johnson & Johnson) vaccine - $10/dose, only one dose, standard refrigerator temperature storage (36 to 46 degrees F) - to everyone that is unvaccinated worldwide. So for only $70 billion maximum ($10 x 7 billion people) in vaccine cost (vaccination costs would be higher), we could end Covid and SARS-CoV-2 right now (based on ramping up and distributing and getting those shots in billions of arms around the world - a tremendous logistical challenge).

We can stop Delta, Epsilon, Zeta, Eta ...
Or not."
2021-07-09 12:27,I fear is that we are going to experience a Delta surge in the fall because there are so many Americans who are refusing to be vaccinated due to misinformation and a perverse pride that Indicates their fealty to a twice impeached disgraced former President. How does one get through to this cohort?￼
2021-07-09 12:29,It's disconcerting that both the CDC and FDA are being challenged so often by the scientific community especially when so many Americans are unwilling to get vaccinated.  Once you lose trust it is very difficult and takes a long time to regain it.  Do we need an independent committee of rotating scientists volunteering their services to vet the vetting by the two agencies?
2021-07-09 12:31,"Are we really so morally bankrupt that we are debating giving people in wealthy countries third boosters when less than 1% of people in low-income countries have received even one dose? Certainly there will be a case for immune-compromised and the elderly, but we are otherwise the prevention of mild illness (since our vaccines have uncoupled viral infection from hospitalization) while we let people (who are overwhelmingly people of color) die in other countries. If humanitarian reasons aren’t enough, then our concerns for variants should compel us to utilize our scarce vaccine resources in other parts of the world."
2021-07-09 12:31,"Well, then, what about Moderna?  I have taken that one and my friends who also took the Moderna virus.  Do they need a booster?  If so when?    Then there was the ""one and done"" from J&J.  That turned out to be a bust, at least in my opinion because of the quality control issues in Baltimore.  Then there was the Astra-Zeneca.  I know that never even got provisional approval in the USA.

This is all getting very confusing to me, and I have a college degree from a school people have heard of.  Imagine the confusion that the majority of Americans must have?

It would be good if we could just get one voice on this and simply require EVERYONE to get vaccinated each year, for COVID as well as for the Common flu vaccine."

2021-07-09 12:37,"Why this push to discredit the Israeli results? Part of the reason that country had such ready access to Pfizer vaccines was so that they could serve as a bellweather for its efficacy for the company and the rest of the world. And we were happy to cite their successes before.

It seems pretty obvious to me that, based on the best available data, the vaccine is meaningfully less effective against delta. The company wouldn’t invest r&d in a delta-specific version if otherwise. 

Just shows that no side is blameless in politicizing science. Here, the powers that be want to keep our reopening and vaccination drive on track. This study doesn’t fit that narrative, so it must be wrong….unreal."
2021-07-09 12:41,"I fully support providing as many vaccines to the world as the US can produce. Presumably the original version is still being produced and offered worldwide. It seems that vaccine demand is plateauing in the US because of ignorance. Those refusing shots should not be given charity care if they become infected with Covid.

If Pfizer and others can produce an updated version, why shouldn’t it be offered? Do we prohibit updated influenza vaccines each year because new variants emerge? The scientists quoted in this article are free to refuse a booster. I prefer to be fully protected. 

Finally, I hope the government approves a new vaccine because it will be available ahead of the increasing proliferation of the Delta variant and will allow Pfizer to make money, too. After all, these are private, for-profit companies on which the public relies, not public charities. Look at the low efficacy of the Russian and Communist Chinese vaccines to see how superior capitalist companies are to state-run enterprises."

There should be a big, parallel push to vaccinate as many willing recipients in the Global population of 7 Billion Plus. But it's not truly a Zero Sum Game. Billions of Doses can only be produced with the manufacturing base available in nations of the West, and this entails considerable subsidy, ultimately from the taxpayers of these relatively few countries. Right now, the issue with vaccinating the 3rd World lies both with increasing the supply of Doses, and in efficiently distributing them. Simply producing Billions of shots of vaccines, then allocating them to countries on the basis of population, does not ensure that these shots will end up in arms.

Finally, nobody really knows the future vector of Covid, and it may transpire that 3rd Shots are absolutely crucial to preventing serious ""Breakthrough"" infections. Ironically, while in the U.S. demand for receiving the 1st Shot of the vaccine has been waning, there is already strong demand among the ""Double Vaxxed"" to receive the Booster

Even if the most vulnerable part of the world has not received one dose. Does this have anything to do with vaccine patent’s suspension for the poor countries  ? Do they want just to double the profit ? 

But maybe this is a ...conspiracy theory ...

I got my vaccine by the way .."
2021-07-09 13:16,"Profit driven medicine and ‘science’ is a conflict of interest and gives the public good reason not to fully trust what they are advised. I’m vaccinated, but when companies make billions on vaccines, the profit motive conflicts with the goal of public health."
2021-07-09 12:24,"“It’s impossible to ignore the global situation,” said Natalie Dean, a biostatistician at Emory University in Atlanta. “It’s hard for me to imagine getting a third dose when there are frontline workers treating Covid patients who still haven’t been vaccinated.”

Oh please. Unvaccinated people have made their (terrible & selfish) choice. At this point, any American who wants the vaccine can get it.  This is rubbish."
2021-07-09 12:28,"a virus does not travel by magic, therefor it is obvious that America is infected by delta, etc, because of selfish people, americans, who travel by plane and cruise ship, and being unvacinated, and not wearing masks and not distancing adds to the infestation in the US (not funny is how most of these selfish people are also republicans)."
2021-07-09 12:51,A prime example why our Pharmaindustrie is great. Others talk while they have a new vaccine ready.
2021-07-09 13:17,"The science indicates otherwise. In fact it now appears that mRNA vaccines may last for years, even decades. 

But from a business standpoint... Pfizer badly wants it to be true that people will need regular booster shots.

The whole world needing your product year in and year out forever is a Bio Tech Firm's Dream Scenario.

Unfortunately in their greed to try and make what they want true to be accepted as true contrary to all the data and science they are increasing the resistance of the already vaccine reluctant by adding confusion to an already confused situation. 

Despicable behaivor."
2021-07-09 13:18,"Now its starting to sound a tad political.  Its also possible that authorities can’t deal with a booster shot campaign because of the problems with getting people to take their first and second shots.  Kind of like no more masks needed inside if you are vaccinated (or unvaccinated), open everything up and whatever happens happens."
2021-07-09 13:19,Still no lyme disease vaccine.
2021-07-09 13:21,All pharmaceutical companies should be non-profits. This fearmongering and clear desperation by Pfizer to sell shots on a yearly basis is despicable.
2021-07-09 13:21,"Before promoting a booster,  perhaps we should aim at getting 75% off the US population vaccinated.   Pfizer might want to use their massive marketing engine to help reduce vaccine skepticism!"
2021-07-09 13:22,"Once again, no guidance for people who received the Johnson and Johnson vaccine, even though the CDC, Fauci and everyone else said take that vaccine if it's available to you.  This really makes me angry--we're abandoned by the scientists."
2021-07-09 13:25,"I'd argue that in general vaccine skepticism is completely normal and just. This is really true for any medical intervention. *Any* medical intervention has the burden to show us why the risk of upsetting the natural state is worth it. And in many cases, it is! 

The evidence compelled me to get vaccinated against COVID-19 in the first place and to push past any natural discomfort I had. The evidence for booster shots, at this time, does no such thing. I'm happy to keep an open mind, but I think it's unwise to jump headfirst into any medical intervention that doesn't provide a solid risk/reward framework. 

Making this claim now also does nothing to build the case for those who remain skeptical to get initial vaccine doses (at least here in the US - I'm sure many folks in other countries would accept one in a heartbeat). Without a solid scientific base showing why boosters are necessary, proposing some endless parade of boosters is only going to make people more hesitant. 

I also see so many people worried about breakthrough infections that rise to the level of a cold. I got vaccinated so that I could stop worrying about severe disease and live my life again. And the minor symptoms show...vaccines are working!"
2021-07-09 13:26,"In response to all the dogpiling on Pfizer, it takes a long time to develop these vaccines. We didn't initially know how long the vaccines would last - they needed to start work on them now rather than sit on their hands for a definitive answer (which if it came back as yes we need them, it would be too late).

Delta will be the predominant strain so further mutations will be based off of Delta as the new baseline. A vaccine based on Delta will better protect against future variants that might escape a vaccine based on the original virus. We need to have this in development now, not when/if they are truly needed."
2021-07-09 13:26,"The data from Israel is not widely replicated.    They have seen hundreds of people come down with the delta variant after inoculation.   It's not clear which vaccine or the dose that failed to work.    The Pfizer vaccine requires strict supply chain chilling and proper handling.    The data may not reflect the mRNA itself, but the complete process of delivery and administration."
2021-07-09 13:30,"Pfizer has proven prophetic in pursuing its course so far with its mRNA SARS-CoV2 vaccine. The science is still out whether we will need boosters or not, however. It will be months before we know whether Pfizer pursuing a new vaccine focusing on the Delta variety is, once again, prophetic, or a greedy push to create a need where one doesn't exist."
2021-07-09 13:31,"So far the delta variant seems to be controlled by current vaccines. Any new vaccine should be shipped asap to health care workers on the front line of caring for infected patients, NOW. We must stop mutations by vaccinating every susceptible individual on every continent. 

As for the ""vaccine hesitant"" in the U.S. They will fulfill the tenets of Darwinian evolution. There will just be fewer Trump supporters and their offspring when all those throwbacks in red states with low vax rates succumb to a preventable infectious agent.."
2021-07-09 13:31,"The reason that Europe is far behind the U.S. is because they delayed to see what was really necessary.

They found out."
2021-07-09 13:33,Pfizer is developing a vaccine against the Delta variant.  They are in the developing stage and then will be testing. That’s different then mass producing and selling. Isn’t that better then being totally unprepared? That does not take away from the vital need to get people vaccinated here and abroad.
2021-07-09 13:34,"I suspected that boosters would be needed for Covid and its variants. When they announce that boosters will be needed, I will get right in line. Viruses love nothing more than to mutate."
2021-07-09 13:34,"If it weren't for: 1) Donald Trump's malfeasance and the horrible politicized examples he set; 2) the impervious-to-facts Republican base who inexplicably worship that self-absorbed liar, scam artist, and complete failure of a human being; and 3) spreaders of anti-vaccination crackpottery, the COVID-19 virus would likely be under control in the the U.S.

But no.  

As is stands, the consequences of their malicious behavior has led to the development of variants, which not only pose continuing risks to people's health but also threatens to dampen or derail the nation's economic recovery.

The vast majority of responsible Americans who sacrificed and did their part this past year to beat the virus should not have to tolerate the selfish, ill-informed, and/or politicized behavior of the unvaccinated any longer.

It is time for the needlessly unvaccinated to face consequences of their own."
2021-07-09 13:38,"It isn't a question of IF we will need a new round of vaccinations,  it is only a question of ""how soon"".    At the rate the virus is mutating,  it is more than likely that we will need them as soon as this Fall, and it is a very good thing that they are in development now.   If the vaccines cannot keep up with the variants,  we face endless waves of death and disability from Covid."
2021-07-09 13:38,"I am fully vaccinated, but my trust regarding these vaccines is starting to erode. First we have news articles saying that we will most likely need a booster. Then we have news article saying that the vaccine will be effective for possibly years and there's no need for a booster. Then there's articles saying that the mRNA vaccines are effective against the Delta variant. Now there's an article saying that the effectiveness will decline after 6 months and you need a booster. This is ridiculous. 

You are losing people's trust not only in reporting, but also trusting the science. I for one, will not be getting any more of these vaccines since there is a plethora of contradictory reporting, and we are constantly seeing new side effects to these vaccines like the casual correlation of pericarditis and myocarditis in 18 to 24 year olds.  We're also seeing reporting how some countries distance the inoculation period for 8 to 12 weeks compared to in the United States of 3 weeks. We're also seeing reporting of some countries mixing vaccines, once considered a bad idea. We're also seeing reporting that the younger age groups should probably only receive a smaller dose or only one dose since their immune systems are more robust. Everyone should use their own discretion when taking these vaccines, but it appears that we can't even trust the science on this one."
2021-07-09 13:42,"While it is good to be prepared to have booster shots available if deemed necessary, I think it's much wiser to make sure that as many people as possible receive their 1st and 2nd shots, in the fight against further variants developing.  Pfizer should continue to mass produce current vaccines and make sure that there is a robust distribution network to places (like Africa) that are barely vaccinated."
2021-07-09 13:43,"Since the CDC stopped tracking breakthrough cases of COVID in vaccinated people, how on earth do they know whether protection is waning?  Are the breakthrough cases in those who were first vaccinated?  What are the breakthrough rates for the 3 approved vaccines, and what variant are they infected with?  Does contract tracing support the (very) early assumption that breakthrough cases are unlikely to transmit the virus to others, vaccinated or not?  I'm not an immunologist, but how can these things be studied by the CDC if they don't care about non-critical infections any more?"
2021-07-09 13:43,"I don't think so... I went for my two shots, doubt you'll get many back for a third."
2021-07-09 13:44,This announcement may be seen as self-serving- but I don't think so. Vaccine makers know they are in a race- as this virus- genetically engineered or not rapidly mutates and transmits.
2021-07-09 13:47,"Understandable there would be suspicion about big pharma’s motivation. On the other hand, there is a pandemic and I’d rather they work to get ahead of things than get caught on their heels."
2021-07-09 13:48,"It’s all about money, money and more money. They must have found out the vaccine is more or less fine against delta variant. Only a slight drop in efficacy.

However, they need a reason to milk federal money and continue selling the costly vaccine to various countries. The best thing is do it is to market it as a delta variant booster so that the fearful may take it again.

All done in the name of profits. Even if this theory is wrong, then they are walking back on their claims that their vaccine is effective for years and years to come. Why make those claims without sound scientific backing. The research community is just doing a disservice to the society by talking about half baked ideas and theories."
2021-07-09 13:52,"Vaccination rates would rise and people would line up for them if people felt like they could trust anyone or anything that is being told to them. But the fact that this has been so politicized, that information is censored, and that Americans are being lied to, led to people not trusting anything, even vaccines."
2021-07-09 13:53,We are worried about new variants and thus justifying the booster.  But the new variants are not likely to come from the US - but from the third world countries!  We should concentrate on vaccinating the world!  How long will it take for us to understand that we are on this earth with 7.5B other people!
2021-07-09 13:52,"Why all the drama from commenters about the possible need or usefulness of a booster shot. Every year for the past 25 years I get a flu shot. Seriously, it's time to grow up and realize that it will take time to fully understand this virus and how best to protect oneself. It could be months, years or decades. Impatience might get you sick or killed."
2021-07-09 13:55,"So far,the Israeli statistic that the effectiveness is declining has been viewed with suspicion given no data has been provided to back it up (apologies if that happened in the last hours to day).

But one might see a financial motivation for a pharmaceutical manufacturer to glom onto anything that might result in more doses getting into arms.

This is premature and disruptive.

At least see if that one number is an outlier before creating a demand for a third dose."
2021-07-09 13:58,"If we could take political grandstanding and profit margins out of the vaccine information equation, what would be the bedrock science about  COVID 19? Something like “wear masks, Social distance, get vaccinated” perhaps?"
2021-07-09 14:00,"The virus is spreading rapidly in countries/regions without vaccine access. Africa has 1% of its population vaccinated, with long lines in several countries of people trying to get what limited supply there is. All the while I can walk into any pharmacy in the US and get vaccinated, no appointment needed. The first and only goal right now should be to increase access to people in regions without the vaccine. Sure continue to develop boosters, but not at the expense of vaccinating the rest of the world, especially when there is little evidence to support them at this time."
2021-07-09 14:01,"Let the drug companies develop all the vaccines they want. If we find that we need them, they will be ready. I don't see this as opportunistic, but proactive."
2021-07-09 14:04,"So Pfizer is doing more development, partly on our dime, that is good no? I am thinking they are back at the well for more money and to make more money, they have proven that money is all they are about. Which is also good isn’t it? That is our system, they are doing well."
2021-07-09 14:06,"Excellent science reporting - thank you for a balanced, thoughtful, accurate, and well researched article."
2021-07-09 14:11,"I find some poetic justice or ""it all balances out"" in this article. The  non mask crowd (Cavalier Crowd) was inadvertently spreading the virus to the masked (Cautious Crowd) and harming people. 
But now the vaccinated (Cautious Crowd) could inadvertently pass it to the unvaccinated (Cavalier Crowd) and harm people."
2021-07-09 14:11,"@A I agree there are many non-Republicans who are refusing vaccinations, but the majority of them do indeed live in Red States with the lowest vaccination rates, resulting in the belief that his supporters are among those least likely getting vaccinated. I disagree with the statement Trump led the initial vaccine development. mRNA studies have been going on for over a decade, so the foundation for the vaccine was set for Trump to authorize funds to accelerate the process of these studies, which were already showing progress by 2018, if not a lot sooner. 
What I don’t understand is why Trump didn’t make a fanfare of he and Melania getting vaccinated in January at the WH before he left office. If this was such a miracle, why isn’t he campaigning for others to get vaccinated? Especially his supporters? Maybe it has something to do with herd mentality (aka Scott Atlas) or perhaps he’d rather leave it a decisive issue so Fox and other right-wing networks continue to have something to whine about."
2021-07-09 14:14,"So, under Trump, the CDC especially and FDA and other government organizations in general, lost all credibility.   Israel is highly vaccinated but still having a problem with the spread of the Delta variant.  Given all the above facts -- I'd take a booster any day.  It's a real pity when you no longer trust your government -- thank you, Trump.  He's the poison that will still be infecting the country long after Covid, I'm afraid.  Is there a vaccine for that?"
2021-07-09 14:17,"I do not understand the negative tone of this article and why it was only stacked with opinions of those against boosters. We absolutely need development of improved vaccines against variants, before they prove necessary. The CDC is being incredibly znd dangerously short sighted with this. What happens when the vaccines no longer work - neither here nor in the third world? That is still very much in the realm of possibiliyy as mutations are known that sidestep T cell immunity and no one knows what will happen shpuld Delta acquire one (and there is now a strong selective pressure for this in breakthrough infections themselves). Vaccine makers need to act fast and generate a vaccine more specific to the variant currently overtaking the planet.

They can do R&D on new versions while scaling up manufacturing of the original one at the same time. We need to be prepared and I'm glad Pfizer/BioNTech are more on top of this than our useless government entities. CDC is not even tracking breakthrough infections and all our knowledge comes from countries that do (UK, Israel)."
2021-07-09 14:17,"Great, standby for the FDA to approve another unnecessary drug. Gotta ignore scientists and line those pockets, just like they're doing with the latest Alzheimer's drug."
2021-07-09 14:17,"I don't care how much money Pfizer is making. The fact is that they and Moderna developed a vaccine that has saved countless lives and has allowed us to return to a semblance of pre-pandemic life.

However, the CDC should not have lifted indoor masking mandates without a vaccine verification mechanism. It's not about protecting those who are vaccinated, although it's unknown whether mild cases can have long haul effects. I have since lost trust in the CDC. That decision seems to have been political, especially in light of the transmissibility of delta. 

It's about preventing the unvaccinated from spreading a viral load in indoor places that allows the virus to mutate to a variant that will eventually evade the vaccine. It's also about protecting children and the immunocompromised who frequent these indoor spaces such as stores, theaters, etc. Masking for the 20 min in the store or 90 min a theater is the least we can do to prevent dangerous mutations. 

Private entities and entertainment venues should require proof of vaccination for employees and customers, or masks to compel those who continue to refuse vaccines and masks to do their part to stem the virus. School districts should also require vaccination for eligible students and staff, just as with polio and other childhood vaccinations. 

And if Pfizer and Moderna are developing boosters and vaccines to deal with delta and future variants, good for them. Better now than after the fact."
2021-07-09 14:22,"""The companies described their plan to develop a new vaccine against Delta as a sort of backup effort in case boosters of the original vaccine should fail. The new vaccine will target the entirety of the spike protein, as opposed to one part, and the first batch has already been produced.



Targeting the entire protein spike  sounds smart.. if it is demonstrated that the dangerous mutations are all altering the spike protein ..  maybe this could take care of all future variations and we would be done with Covid -19  

This time produce enough for the world lets get on with the post pandemic!"
2021-07-09 14:22,"The information out from Israel is concerning.  I am grateful for Pfizer being proactive.  We all have been caught with our pants down throughout this pandemic.  If I need a booster, you will find me at the front of the line.  FDA, CDC, what is the issue here?"
2021-07-09 14:24,I’m trusting Pfizer more than the FDA and CDC at this point. Bring on the boosters.
2021-07-09 14:25,"This needs to be clarified quickly.  Last thing anyone needs now is confusion over whether or not a booster is needed and if the current vax is effective against Delta.

I'm coming up on the six-month point since the first of my two Pfizer shots.  And I want to know with a great degree of certainty: Do I or do I not need a booster?

I've respected Pfizer and hope to continue to do so.  But they are Big Pharma and accustomed to making gobs of money.  So I'm skeptical, to say the least, whether a booster is necessary or just a way to sell the Government (and me, the taxpayer) more vaccine.

We need clarification now!"
2021-07-09 14:27,"The problem is the great number of people refusing to have the
vaccines. That won't change with a ""booster"" shot. 

""Please"" isn't working."
2021-07-09 14:30,I see no real downside of developing a booster. Better safe than sorry. Every month we have more data. It would be a shame to realize we need a booster later this year or next but to have not developed it.
2021-07-09 14:33,"I gladly went for my two Pfizer shots but I am skeptical of a third at this point in time. For one, the CDC has stopped tracking breakthrough cases so how can we know if this is justified? After Delta, there will be more variants of concern until we get larger portions of the world's population vaccinated. It seems the number one priority is still to get vaccines into arms of the unvaccinated - everywhere. If new variants keep arising as quickly as they are now, boosters won't even be able to keep up with them."
2021-07-09 14:35,"""Vaccine efficacy may decline six months after immunization, the companies said in a news release, and booster doses may be needed to fend off virus variants.""

MAY??  Unproven, looks like a sales job to me."
2021-07-09 14:35,"There is a mounting fear that already vaccinated people will need a booster as vaccine efficacy wanes.  Science does not support that.  Pfizer could be profit taking based on fear mongering.  All our resources need to go to getting the rest of the world vaccinated instead of supplying a little-needed booster shot to the wealthy nations.  It’s more important to help the poorer nations.  The wealthy nations should instead invest in world wide vaccination programs, starting with all health care workers.  We need to protect health care workers around the world if only to have enough trained people to help everyone.  The only health care workers refusing shots are those in the U.S. stupid enough to believe Fox News propaganda.  Billions of people world wide would take the vaccine readily if it were offered, reducing the chance of a more deadly variant developing.  WHO needs to tell the wealthy countries what it needs to carry out this program, if it hasn’t already, and our under taxed wealthy should chip in significantly as well instead of buying yet another over priced status symbol."
2021-07-09 14:36,"While it is fitting for vaccine companies to have an 'updated' vaccine available IF one is needed,   it is entirely wrong for them to claim efficacy WITHOUT also advising the R value for the specific variant(s).

R value is the infection rate.    IF a vaccinated person is in an area of low R for a specific variant, the probability of that person contracting the variant is lower than IF another vaccinated person were in an area with a high R for the variant.

An excellent scientific video produced by Vox entitled ""Why you can't compare vaccines"" is available on YouTube.     This is well worth the watch and is more illuminating than one would expect."
2021-07-09 14:36,"Pfizer and BioNTech do what I would expect a pharma company would do: They see a potential market, and start developing a product, a booster specifically against the Delta variant.  Maybe we'll want or need it, maybe we won't.  However, the important part of this news is in the word ""booster"": One can only boost something that is already there.  In this case, being fully  immunized against COVID-19.  Waiting for this booster to get vaccinated is like waiting for the add-on supercharger to come before I buy my car to boost;  and, in case of the COVID vaccine, that's downright dangerous."
2021-07-09 14:41,"It's surely a good thing for everyone that research anticipates possible future need for boosters.  If this research isn't done, not only the US but the world could be vulnerable in case of more threatening variants.

Unmentioned here: People with autoimmune conditions, in treatment for cancer, and those with otherwise compromised immune systems will need these third shots to achieve the protection that others receive from one or two doses."
2021-07-09 14:46,"Kudos to Pfizer and Moderna for working on boosters.  While the ideas expressed in the article are targeted toward the average person with a healthy immune system, there is a currently an underserved population of us with immune suppressing conditions (including age) that also need to be addressed.

I look forward to the development of reliable tests to determine whether a new version of the vaccine, or another dose of the existing vaccine is indicated."
2021-07-09 14:49,"I don’t know who or what to believe.

There are the pharmaceutical companies who want to make money.

There is the government which wants to reopen.

There is the CDC which seems incompetent and/or political.

There are scientists who say contradictory things who have conflicts of interest.

There is the credible press that doesn’t seem to be willing or able to do real investigative reporting.

There are scared and/or misinformed Americans who refuse to get any vaccine and whining entitled others who refuse to get a booster or even wear a mask.

There are billions of people on Earth who can’t get a vaccine.

The FDA still hasn’t approved the vaccines.

There are variants we know about and those that don’t yet exist.

I have absolutely no idea what’s going to happen and I am officially giving up.  Maybe I’ll take a survivalist course."
2021-07-09 14:52,"Virus is not simpleton microorganism. It is smart as we are or may even be smarter. As long as there are unvaccinated folks, it has petri dish to happily replicate and mutate to more transmissible and deadlier variants. Only robust mass vaccination and durable immunity are scientifically proven methods to prevent spread of disease and its complications."
2021-07-09 13:20,"Thankfully, the science and scientists are  able to respond and adapt to change.
 But you still can’t fix Stupid and Ignorant “know-it-all’s” that don’t read, listen or process anything past lunch.
 There will likely be a day, relatively soon, when we will wish we only had a delta variant to deal with. There will likely be another lockdown because the anti-Vaxxers will take us there.
 They will get sick , they will be hospitalized and they will die from Covid. 
If you don’t get the vaccination , does it really matter which variant kills you?"
2021-07-09 14:02,"Happily twicely Pfizer-vaccinated here: hugely disappointed in Pfizer for their shameless opportunisticism. Their bad  faith will turn many reasonable people like me into antivax ones. My body and my government's wallet IS NOT YOURS Pfizer!

The coronavirus crisis is not an opportunity to turn billions into being your slaves without an end date."
2021-07-09 14:36,"By the way, the point is that refusing to be vaccinated when vaccines are very available, and not having access to vaccines when they aren’t, increases these￼ questions and everybody’s risks.

You want to help things settle down, get yer shots. Help others get theirs. 

Otherwise, you’re contributing to a vast, uncontrolled, open-air experiment that runs forever. 

Which is pretty darn stupid."
2021-07-09 14:16,"Lets face it, this is the result of overzealous scare mongering media which never wants covid to die, hence giving opportunity to the likes of Pfizer and other companies to keep selling stuff! Equally culpable are people, many of them 'liberal' readers of Times, who crave for zero covid risk and keep on wearing two masks after a vaccine for which enough evidence has been submitted that it works against all variants in terms of serious illness and death. Chances of you dying after fully vaccinated is less than you walking towards a parking lot to get your car! But fear mongers will still keep on harping about this variant and that variant and breakthrough cases etc! Pandemic is not gonna be over until  these people grow up!"

2021-07-09 14:01,…smells like blatant profiteering to me.
2021-07-09 14:58,Thought I saw an announcement in May that the CDC is only tracking breakthrough infections where there is hospitalization or death. No data being collected on breakthrough infections where symptoms are mild or if it is asymptomatic. The Israelis seem to be counting all infections. How can we in the US even begin to make informed decisions on a personal or policy level without adequate data to work with?
2021-07-09 14:59,"It would have been helpful to include discussion of what ""Delta"" changes in the virus.  

From other reading part of the changes to Delta are additional copies of a gene suppressing interferon, a signal to the immune system of illness.  

Reformulating the vaccine would have little impact on this."
2021-07-09 15:01,Anyone still doubting that the almighty dollar is driving the obscene amount of vaxx coercion?  Now they are coming back for those already vaccinated.  It seems the strategy is to sell to the low hanging fruit.
2021-07-09 15:06,"Once again another story about vaccine efficacy, variants and further testing that makes zero mention of the J&J shot. Millions of Americans, myself included, were urged to get this vaccine but since then silence. Silence at a time of ever changing realities while other vaccines are being tested and proven to be effective. It’s all about the mRNA vaccines. Please don’t ignore the unfortunate Americans that got this other one-shot vaccine. This article further makes me believe every individual who received the J&J vaccine should be eligible to receive a mRNA booster. We only received one shot with a much lower efficacy against the original virus and deserve to have the same protection the majority of Americans now enjoy."

During this pandemic, we must be more cautious and knowledgeable of the events going on around us. In the case of vaccines, understanding what is the best approach in neutralizing this virus is key. Therefore, questions asked in this article such as, whether there should be a third dose, concern for variants, and how should vaccines be distributed, are questions we must face to eliminate this pandemic together. Preparation and research is fundamental in fighting back this virus, so we must do our best to support this. Though not all of us are scientists, we can still educate our selves through reading articles such as this. I hope that companies that do develop vaccines look beyond making profit and focus on the human aspect. As said in the article ""our best protection is to get the rest of the world vaccinated."" The faster we vaccinate the rest of the population, the less likely this virus will continue to spread.

Eliminating this pandemic is truly only possible through combined effort from each and every one of us. Each of us has a role in this battle against the pandemic. Whether the role be simply getting vaccinated, social distancing, wearing your mask, researching the virus, developing vaccines, or administering vaccines, every effort counts towards eliminating the pandemic."
2021-07-09 15:14,"A few of the comments here are concerned about Pfizer making money. However, common sense should tell us that if we have the Delta variant of Covid-19 that is more potent than the original Covid-19. How long until Covid-19 mutates again to  start hurting children and/or those already vaccinated??"
2021-07-09 15:16,"The simple rule of viruses, as I understand it, is that they continue to spread and mutate as long as they are allowed to circulate freely around the unvaccinated populations. And each variant becomes more contagious and lethal compared to its previous version. Pfizer and Moderna are considered to be the best vaccines that provide over 90% protection to fully vaccinated people.  However, Pfizer's efficacy, according to Pfizer, lasts for only six months. After that, Pfizer is recommending a booster shot. As it stands, Pfizer's announcement could further add to the confusion about the vaccines at large. While Pfizer contends that the effect of two doses becomes weak after six months, the CDC and many health experts argue that fully vaccinated people are protected for a much more extended period than six months. This contradiction between the vaccine producer and the leading experts on virology throws a wrench into the entire vaccination process. It makes people suspicious of the motives of the vaccine producers and the government authorities that are desperately trying to get over 70% of the population vaccinated in the shortest possible time for economic and political reasons. The vaccination process has already faced roadblocks by the supporters of Trump and the Republican Party. Not to mention those apprehensive about the after-effects of the vaccines.  As such, the recent controversy does not bode well for the vaccination process in North America and the world as a whole."
2021-07-09 15:18,"I am 72 years old diabetic scared of COVID to death. I am fully vaccinated with 2 two doses of Pfizer vaccine. I am willing to take the booster shot as soon as possible. The Delta variants seem to be very dangerous. Pfizer  a private pharmaceutical company , is a business entity doing fantastic job saving lives. I do not mind if they are making money or profiteering. Nothing wrong for any business to make money legally and ethically."
2021-07-09 15:19,"There is data emerging that Covid is behaving like the Flu virus in some aspects. The portion of the spike protein that is highly immunogenic, meaning stimulates the most amount of antibodies, is the portion that is mutating the most. It would mean our current antibodies may not be as effective as new variants emerge. The variants of concerns have emerged every four months or so unlike the flu virus which seem to have taken 12 months on an average. The faster cycle is probably because of high number of infections and replications across the globe. I think a booster dose is inevitable. There are experts and then there are those of us who actually see Covid patients. I think if the safety levels of mRNA vaccines  remains as good as they are now I would gladly take a booster dose in the coming months. It has been more than 6 months since I took the second dose of mRNA vaccine."
2021-07-09 15:22,"I had my second dose of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine in mid-January.  It is now almost mid-July.   With so many unknowns about the current and emerging variants, a booster shot seems like a reasonable idea to me.   I'm ready!"
2021-07-09 15:23,"And cha-ching goes Pfizer's vaccine making cash register. This is a cash cow like no other. People can't afford the new drugs Pfizer manufactures so they keep buying generics, despite their massive ad spending. But the government is paying for the vaccines so all Pfizer needs to do is convince Uncle Sam we need repeated boosters and they'll make billions of dollars each time they release another one."
2021-07-09 15:23,"The increase in Delta infections is caused by those misguided folks who refuse to get vaccinated.  If they had been around in 1954, when the Salk polio vaccine was available and refused polio vaccination, then polio would still be around today. What fools."
2021-07-09 15:25,"So glad we have made great vaccination progress in many parts of the US, yet we are on the verge of once again being too insular and self absorbed. Look at vast swaths of the world around us where deaths are spiraling out of control, because that’s where even more vicious variants are likely to incubate and proliferate out of control.  Many Indian Americans have been keeping tabs on their families and friends in that nation where sickness, hospitalization and death abound. A sad tale indeed. The delta variant’s ability to evade single jabs of AZ in India is worrisome.
 
The marvel of mRNA is that it can almost instantly be reprogrammed to optimally immunize against nasty new variants, so next year’s covid booster shot should be able to block delta and more. I’m glad that Biden recently called upon a global set-aside or relaxation of patents on covid vaccines because he can exert muscle of the fact that NIH co-owns the patent on mRNA itself, which presumably they’ve licensed to bioNtech/Pfizer and Moderna for their own patented vaccines. 

We’ve gotta get the rest of the world vaxxed and that’s a huge challenge. Otherwise vicious new mutations will continue to incubate elsewhere and we’ll keep playing whack-a-mole in the US when they inevitably infiltrate here. In the meantime we should mask-on in public indoor settings and avoid gathering in throngs.

2021-07-09 15:25,"I think nobody knows and your article lacks any humbleness. 
In my opinion research must go on, especially since the first to be vaccinated were the elder and the healthcare workers. If the delta or lambda( Peru) can breakthrough enough to make the healthcare providers sick we are back to square one.
Unvaccinated people, travelers(for vacation or immigrants), rioters, rally goers and people throwing away  all cautiousness  are all fueling new infections and new mutation possibilities. Each party took a political approach defending some of this behaviors and demonizing others. The media and the politicians are all gambling hoping that it will not be too bad, and any casualties will be seen as the fault of the “ others”."
2021-07-09 15:35,"1. Okay, they’re doing research. Whoop-de-do.

2. I seem to recall reading that boosters might be needed and that Pfizer was looking into them.

3. If you live in an area where case rates are climbing, I would wear a mask when I went into a store or an airplane or a bank.

4. I see some of us would still rather yell at liberals and they science and they oharma rather than act like adults.

5. It doesn’t surprise me that people have a hard time with the concept that vaccination and masking up in risk areas can’t guarantee their safety absolutely, but is one heckuva lot better than nothing. After all, we would rather know that there was no risk at all.

But I do get tired of the dolts who use this to justify doing exactly as they please and skipping vaccination, as they are increasing my small risks quite a lot."

Yet, many of the commenters on this article are expressing skepticism about getting the latest version of a booster to update protection from a virus that can kill you or those you love. 
I do agree that we need to vaccinate the unvaccinated to prevent spread and mutation of COVID, but we need to move forward and look to prevention of future mutations, too. 
Also, the FDA needs to update the approval of a vaccine that so many of us are being encouraged to receive. Emergency authorization should be updated to reflect the current knowledge of vaccine risks and benefits."

I am grateful to them every day for creating the vaccine that is keeping my family and many others safe. BUT ... as a drug company, their primary goal is profit. Government agencies like the CDC should be giving us unbiased information to keep us safe. BUT ... the CDC was shamefully compromised during the trump years; the loss of public trust in them will be repaired very slowly. So, who can we trust??"
2021-07-09 16:18,"What I am not seeing is urgency to build capacity to produce enough vaccine. We need 6 Billion doses produced in six months to achieve the goal of achieving herd immunity globally. Distribution would still be a problem, but now we are not even close to using available distribution capacity. Current global vaccine production capacity is inadequate and cannot produce more than a fraction of the necessary number of doses. What will we do when the next pandemic hits? The next could be much more virulent."
2021-07-09 19:16,"The immunocompromised are not considered in the article.  Boosters may or may not be needed for the general population, but many of us with weak immune systems (cancer patients, organ transplant recipients, etc) still don't have full protection from the two shots we got.

However, I did notice this para in a news article this AM:

""Pfizer announced in May that it projected global sales of its coronavirus vaccine to reach $26 billion in 2021.  The company has also been frank that its current pricing -- in the United States, $19.50 a shot -- is temporary.  On an earnings call in February, Frank D'Amelio, Pfizer's executive vice president of global supply, noted a more typical price for a vaccination was $150 or $175 per dose.""

To this  day the CDC official mask stance is that the N95s are not recommended for general use, even though they are the ones the really stop the spread.  In the begining the CDC botched the testing roll out and cost 5 weeks.  After outstanding phase 3 trial results in late October, the FDA took way too long to grant an EUA to the Pfizer vaccine and Moderna.  Now these two agencies are scolding Pfizer for being proactive in using data to show a third shot might be beneficial.   The report published by Pfizer showed a 5 fold increase in antibody response after the third shot.  This would be great for  immuno-compromised people and elderly.  The real heroes of the pandemic have been the creators  of vaccines and monoclonal antibodies.

But we also have to be honest - those who claim, the vaccines have trackers, or are poison, or too quick, or covid Is False will not vaccinate even if you go to their home - do we really think Rand Paul will vaccinate if a nurse goes to his home?

I am afraid that some workers who go will get harmed, some ,ay even be shot - I wish this was not the case, but it may well be

If you ask me, we also need to start having real restrictions on those who choose not to vaccinate (not the ones who can't for medical reasons) - what those restrictions are I do not know and clearly any will be challenged in court, no doubt some will be banned but also many will be approved too

2021-07-07 10:42,"Why isn’t there more research and reporting about the impact on the virus’ evolution into new and more dangerous strains by people getting only half a vaccine dose (as in just the first of 2 shots)?  

Doesn’t such a practice — of neglecting to get the full dose of vaccine — while perhaps somewhat limiting the speed and breadth of mutations leading the virus to evolve, also make it more possible that vaccine-resistant variants will arise?  

Or do viruses not respond to unfinished vaccine doses that way they and bacteria sometimes respond within the bodies of people who slack off on any-vital and antibacterial medication once they begin to feel better, disregarding doctors’ it phatmacies’ important instructions to complete the full course of medication, lest multi-drug resistant variants arise and spread?"

Some reports say that people living in the worlds’ poorest countries may have wait until 2023 - yes, that’s 2 years from now - for the vaccines to reach them.

Assuming it’s the same vaccine for humans and animals (as is likely for, say, chimpanzees since they are closest to us genetically), shouldn’t we be sending any surplus vaccines to our impoverished and underserved brothers and sisters before we send them to zoos for use on animals, especially since those animals, kept in cages or behind high barriers many yards away, aren’t getting close to anyone save a small number of keepers, all of whom should wear N95 masks if there is any concern for their own or the animals’ health?"

We don't permit reckless or unthinking or misinformed people to: run red lights and stop signs; put their children in our schools without inoculation for mumps and measles or threaten our safety on airplanes.  Perhaps the sheer availability of reliable vaccines make it now reasonable to refuse hospitalization for those who cannot show they are vaccinated?"

At this point, if you're not getting a vaccine, but can, and refuse to on matters that are not directly tied to a personal health issue, you're the problem and perhaps it is time for your healthcare premiums and other medical expenses should you get sick, to be taken into consideration and given a hefty raise. The Biden Administration can only do so much. America also has a great, well organized military complex that can readily be deployed to further the ""wartime effort"" required to assure even greater vaccination rates.

Money and politics are clearly at work here. The President does not wish to antagonize political supporters and undermine those Democrats in Congress who are in political peril and need every vote.

Millions upon millions have received the vaccines, with no major adverse effects reported yet. And while it's true that we can't know the long-term effects of the vaccines, I would argue that you're taking just as big a risk, if not bigger, just going out your door every morning and walking your dog.

If this was cancer and the vaccines represented the best shot at remission or a cure, none of these people would be hesitating. They'd beg for the short; get it immediately; and then hope for the best.

But when it comes to COVID - well, all of a sudden they're leery of vaccines, side effects, experts in white coats, and a conspiracy under every bush. 

That's their right - to a point. Now their selfishness is literally holding back the entire U.S. I'm out of patience with them.

I wouldn't waste another second trying to coax these people to get vaccinated. It only strokes their massively-inflated sense of self-importance. Instead, allow them to ""choose"" to remain unvaccinated. In return, make them pay one heck of a price for that choice.

Announce that Americans have until the end of July to get vaccinated. After that, Medicare and health insurance companies should decline to cover the medical bills of anyone who refuses the vaccine and gets COVID (exceptions will be made for those that, for medical reasons, can't be vaccinated). Employers, universities, businesses, etc., all need to MANDATE vaccination."

Or, those that have gotten vaccinated should get HUGE tax breaks--and those not--NONE. These selfish individuals are serving as mutation factories. Vaccine passports are a step in the right direction, but checking them will create potential issues with angry unvaccinated individuals. 

Reminds me of the story of two people in a boat. The person at the stern is drilling a hole in the floor. The other person looks on aghast and says, ""what are you doing""?! The drilling individuals says, ""it is my side of the boat, I can do what I want"".

It is a slippery slope to mandate (think abortion--on established law they ought not to be able to mandate or disallow on the basis of saving a life). I'm not sure how it could work vis-a-vs public/mass consideration. The best they can do is make it mandatory to enter government properties, or for businesses to make it mandatory.  Proof should be required. Masks are a different issue--easily mandated a la seatbelts or traffic signals.

Many kids being home-schooled and yet allowed to take classes like gymnastics or go to camp in public places. (and their unvaccinated parents coming and going)."
2021-07-07 12:41,"I have zero empathy for anti vaxxers who are not auto immune- there must be a cost or consequence for their unpatriotic actions. 

Maybe they lose infrastructure dollars since we need to spend more to get them vaccinated."
2021-07-07 12:48,I can just imagine how some people in my rural area will respond when someone knocks on their door offering a vaccine. Hope they can run back to their car fast before the dogs and guns come out!
2021-07-07 12:42,Full FDA approval would probably mandate vaccination for all military members plus additionally many businesses would step up and do the same. What’s the holdup? No question this would save lives.
2021-07-07 12:43,"Why do we have vaccination cards if no one even asks for them? If Biden was serious about vaccinations then he use an executive order making it mandatory for all health care workers, teachers, students, and first responders to get vaccinated. Then he would he would require proof of vaccination in order to fly.  We can't afford to have our political culture held hostage by people who don't care about their own health, let alone the health of others."
2021-07-07 12:53,"I've had several medical and dental appointments here in NH in the last two months. Prior to arrival, I'm asked by the providers, ""Do you have a fever or cough? Have you traveled out of state in the last two weeks?"" When I inform them that I'm fully vaccinated, they say, ""That's wonderful to hear. We're not allowed to ask you that.""

So if _medical_ providers (!) at this stage of the pandemic are not able to inquire about patients' vaccination status, I don't have much hope that the private sector is going to take the lead in requiring Covid vaccinations.

My only problem with this is the cost to my finances caring for them if they don’t have health insurance. These kinds of people will always exist, in both parties. So, stop trying to change nature, let it take its course."
2021-07-07 13:08,"In terms of behavior, what we are seeing with the COVID-19 vaccination rates is similar to the annual flu vaccine. Many people don't bother to get that one either. Some refuse to get it simply because they can. Speaking from experience, it takes much time, effort, and resources to move the needle from where we are currently to a rate exceeding 70%."

2021-07-07 13:09,"The key message for the US public that is not pushed forward hard enough is:

""COVID Vaccination is to protect the entire community in this nation, and not to yourself alone.""  

Unvaccinated individuals allow the virus to continue to multiply and spread to others.

US social media and Gov need to push this patriotic message as hard as possible."
2021-07-07 13:14,"Yes.  Door to door, like the Census, with people who can verify people's existing status.  Those not immediately vaccinated should:

1) NOT be eligible for further government benefits (medicare, social security, food stamps, welfare etc).  The threat of getting removed from the free handouts would solve 90% of the problem; 

2) pay higher taxes (if not eligible for the handouts in #1 above);

3) should be required to wear masks at all times in public; and

4) should be listed in the local papers and on the web as unvaccinated, so that others know to stay away from them.

Mandatory vaccination could follow by October 31, if steps 1-4 above did not solve the problem.

When the polio vaccine came around, no one was squalking or claiming bias or anything like it.  No one remembers this, but the Times had a good article about it a few months ago.  

We don't have polio here, but other countries are not so lucky.  Do we really want to be dumb and let these non-vaxxers put our children and the old folks at risk?  No.  Therefore, get the vaccines out to the people and don't be afraid to get shots in arms (or into tuchuses, if they want)."
2021-07-07 13:05,"The great clinics, research universities and medical associations need to reach out more aggressively, not just to deliver shots, which they did very well, but to push the need for them.  They need to shoot down rumors."
2021-07-07 13:26,Health systems and all care facilities need to mandate vaccines now. Call your doctor/hospital/assisted living facility and complain today. You and your family members are not safe there. It is their chief duty to put safety of patients first. Put pressure on them.
2021-07-07 13:28,"My son, who does administrative work for the US Army, says the number of unvaccinated soldiers is very high- at least half. He says it is because they can't force them to take the vaccine until final FDA approval. Meanwhile, we have tens of thousands of military personnel running around at risk of illness, incubating variants. What insanity."
2021-07-07 13:33,"More large hospital systems. as one example, need to follow the example of Methodist Hospital in Houston and require people working in health care to get vaccinated, particularly with cases rising again (especially in unvaccinated areas).

As many have already noted, it is difficult to imagine getting on top of this pandemic without vaccine mandates (even just one shot, given some recent concerns). It is difficult to see why we cannot require the nation's schools (primary, secondary, colleges and universities). To require vaccinations. Masks won't be enough for grade-schoolers and with college bound children living in dorms and other close quarters, it is difficult to imagine a comparable safety step for public health. 

If the FDA were to finalize approval of several of the existing vaccines, that would help the process--particularly in terms of the political and legal fights."
2021-07-07 13:48,"“Mr. Biden said his administration was not giving up on persuading people that vaccination was in their best interests, and in the interest of the country.” Given the fact that half the country continues to support a party that works against their best interests, I have little hope that they will be persuaded by this strategy. If we have any hope of achieving widespread vaccination, it will be because universities, corporations, and other groups make vaccination a prerequisite to employment and other activities. And it’s about time that the FDA moves beyond emergency authorization to full authorization; that will at least remove the fig-leaf that ‘justifies’ vaccine reluctance."
2021-07-07 14:02,"More people, especially people in minority communities, will be homeschooling their kids this year because they aren’t happy with the way the public schools are handling vaccination requirements among other things, Everywhere I go, I see Black people in masks and white people not in masks, as a general rule. Black people are just not ready to trust that the white people around them are getting vaccinated. Just like they’re not ready to trust that their kids will be safe at the schools run by white people. 

An article about the rise in Black homeschooling in Alabama and Mississippi during the pandemic would be so illuminating. Many Black parents have decided to stick with homeschooling because they feel that their kids are getting a better education from them, from someone who looks like them and cares about them. As a white educator and a product of Alabama public schools wherein I didn’t have a Black teacher in my K-12 career until 9th grade in the 1990’s, I will say that they are most likely correct. Racism is alive and kicking. Case in point: Tucker Carlson and his white supremacist ilk suggesting we put cameras in classrooms to make sure teachers are “ideologically pure” and not teaching CRT. Who wants to teach in such an environment, and who wants to let their child “learn” in it?"
2021-07-07 13:38,"It is  Republican led states with the lowest Covid-19 vaccination rates, so it appears to be the fault of the Republican Governors in those states. A lack of leadership at the state level is the root cause for the new Covid-19 deaths, where only the unvaccinated die."

That way, it is still a choice people can make for themselves, but not a choice without cost."
2021-07-07 14:24,"To be fair, if a vaccine is not fully approved it shouldn’t be mandated either. Rather than fretting over why people aren’t getting vaccinated, the government should accelerate the full approval process without compromising safety. After full approval we can discuss mandates."

This kind of vaccine is less likely to cause problems because of how it is made and because the vaccine does not last long in the body. Assuring people of it’s relative safety among people who are not just being paranoid can be successful but will take some time."
2021-07-07 14:26,"Tough enough? Really? The problem is mistrust about the motives of those who insist that vaccinations are necessary. Even talk of forcing people to be vaccinated will confirm the fears and create more resistance. Then what? Everything that has been done has been voluntary, all of it. Does anyone who is not just fighting mad think that all who choose not to be vaccinated can be threatened into compliance without some totally made outcome? Biden can do his best to gain trust and to convince, that’s it."
2021-07-07 14:44,"Ideally, vaccinate enough people to stop the way the virus can spread, end of pandemic. However, he pandemic will spread less quickly as more and more people are vaccinated. Slowly the spread reduces the opportunities for new variants. If you cannot achieve the perfect, go for the better. Make the vaccine available where it’s wanted, now. In the end vaccination campaigns work because people decide to be vaccinated."
2021-07-07 14:13,"We were in trouble the moment Covid became political, almost on Day One. Then Trump told us is would magically go away, so not to worry. Now, mandating vaccinations is the only way out unless we all mask up and start all over again. Anyone want that?"

We need to televise advertisements that show the devastated husband or wife or son or daughter who has lost their loved ones due to the virus .  They need to tell the audience how sorry they are that their loved ones did not get the vaccine and have died.  At this point only fear will work to get some anti-vaccine people to change.
2021-07-07 14:56,"Haha.  So, the Biden administration is saying the exact same thing for which Trump was trashed -- it's volunatry.  In addition, now NYT agrees with Trump that the power lies with the states.

But, this seems to be the only thing that Bidenfolk think is up to the states -- not medical care in general, not guns, not crime, not nuthin'.  Except now this because... uh, because.  Well, because the election is over, and it's not going to be our fault when things turn south."
2021-07-07 14:50,"The door-to-door approach will work for the fraction of unvaccinated people that lack access.  But anyone claiming they are concerned about safety at this point won’t be swayed by full FDA approval.  These folks aren’t experts on clinical trials or safety studies.  People who are experts in these areas have been vaccinated.  People claiming concern for safety are hiding their real reason for vaccine hesitancy.  

I am sure the real reasons are varied, but I’ll bet the Venn diagram for people refusing the vaccine and those with certain political affiliation is almost a perfect circle.  Look at the vaccination rate maps. 

It will take a concerted effort by leaders that are respected by these folks to persuade them to vaccinate.  They’ll trust Trump, their pastors and their favorite media personalities over scientists, public health experts and the government.  

If Biden pushes for mandatory vaccination and vaccine passports, it will be seen as autocratic overreach, an infringement on state and personal rights.  Heck, a lot of these folks are outraged because they think he’s already done it - that’s what they read on Facebook! 

Let the free market insurance industry address this issue and be the ‘bad guy’.  Keep vaccines free, help the hospitals, but stop covering COVID-related treatment for individuals that could vaccinate.  It’s like living in a flood zone - you choose to live there, you pay the repairs.  As the bills come due, watch the stampede for vaccines."
2021-07-07 14:56,"Is all Covid-related care — medications, physicians, hospitalizations, assistive equipment, etc. — free to patients, as are vaccinations? If so, will that last forever? Will Covid be considered a pre-existing condition by insurers for decades to come for an infected person, possibly preventing them from obtaining health insurance? If there is a chance that a vaccine-hesitant person might have to bankrupt  themselves in the “unimaginable” possibility of contracting Covid, perhaps he/she would reconsider the free vaccine."
2021-07-07 15:13,"President Biden can't overcome the forces of willful resistance to facts and truth. We are a civil society and as such want to protect one another as best as is possible. It seems those who refuse to be vaccinated against the Covid 19 virus based on political ideology are defiantly telling the rest of us that they don't want the vaccination for their own protection or for the well being of their  fellow man. We should then not feel sorry for them if they do become infected. Perhaps health insurers including Medicare and Medicaid should be allowed to deny health coverage for those who willfully refused inoculation.  We know the vaccines are effective in preventing death or serious illness from this virus. If you willfully refuse vaccination, then you should bear the financial and health burden if you become ill or die. Admittedly this us not a compassionate answer but those who willfully refuse vaccination at this point don't deserve our compassion."

2021-07-07 12:36,"I don't understand why we just don't make the vaccines mandatory -- like seatbelts -- or needed for all jobs, buses, Ubers, planes, buildings with security, government buildings, etc.  Yes, the anti-vaxxers, Trump insurrectionists and GOP nuts in general will claim loss of freedom, but they do that anyway.  This is a public health issue.  And if we value the economy, it's for the best.  Seatbelt laws caused an awful ruckus and you still see press when one rare life gets saved by NOT wearing one.

To not be vaccinated has been a choice.
Irrational, but staunchly made by many.
Blithely amongst us now.

Please lead the charge to shore up our spaces. Homes. Work. Community life.
Then, these folks will have another choice.
To wantonly infect us all will not be one.

Bring on the vaccine proof requirements. The ID system.

2021-07-07 15:53,"Those of us who are vaccinated but live in Red States feel abandoned by the President and CDC. No one can or should force a needle into anyone's arm.  However the President could issue an executive order that all Federal employees must be fully vaccinated and all businesses should require masks of employees and customers until the country achieves national herd immunity. - CDC jumped the gun with its ""masks off"" policy. Before, when masks were required - if someone in a store did not wear one - customers could give that person a wide birth - not so any more. - At Xmas 2020 the airlines canceled flights - effectively shutting down air travel during a dangerous time. Madison Square Garden and the Bruce Springsteen Broadway show require proof of vaccination for admission. Perhaps it will take private industry to get the country to herd immunity of 70-85%."

There may not be much that US public policy can or will do to ensure our public safety until ""full approvals"" remove the EUA tag from our vaccines.  In the current climate of ReTrumplican opposition to anything that might be considered public health measures, the political motives for requirements will limit what we can accomplish vis the virus."
2021-07-07 16:27,The only way you’re going to get Alabama and Mississippi to meet the 70 percent threshold by the end of the year is by telling people here that college football season will be cancelled unless more people get vaccinated.

Or perhaps, it is merely a sad commentary on the readiness of the modern military force that service members are given an option on vaccinations.  As Commander-in-Chief, it is an easy problem to solve:  two lines one for the shot or one for administrative discharge ---  

If you can't get the military on-board, it is doubtful you can get the public to get on-board.   Perhaps, denying Medicaid and Medicare and insurance coverage for the unvaccinated after 90 days’ notice might change some minds.  People tend to think about protecting their pocketbook."
2021-07-07 17:07,"Read comments to this story on the Fixed News website and weep. Politicizing Covid may well be Trump's most significant offense against the country. His supporters are stalwart in defending their right to die and risk the lives of others by rejecting vaccination, even as Trump takes credit for making vaccines possible. Kudos to Biden for his continued efforts to defeat the virus by protecting all the people...not just those who voted for him. That's called leadership."
2021-07-07 17:07,"Agree with the experts wholeheartedly. Biden’s advisors are absolutely wrong with their current strategy. We have lost over 600,000 lives. How many more need to die before they open their eyes? First and foremost, put pressure on the “FDA the snail” to approve the vaccines thru regular channel asap so that federal employees can be mandated  to receive the vaccine. We have robust clinical data and there is no reason for the FDA to sit and watch. Second, mandate vaccination for those on Medicaid to resolve low compliance in this group. Third, put indirect pressure on private employers to mandate vaccination. Fourth, require all health systems to report vaccine compliance asap. Tag less than 90 % compliance with lower Medicare payment.
Enough is enough. The variants are dangerous and vaccination is the only way to save our nation. Our nation will be completely destroyed with another escalation which we observed in 2020 and early 2021. Time is running out. We elected Biden for good governance and now is the time for him to deliver."
2021-07-07 18:17,"Dr. Ezekiel Emanuel recognizes that requiring vaccinations as a condition of employment could backfire, but what about requiring the Covid-19 vaccine as a condition for an employee to participate in their employer's health plan?

The ""vaccine"" is not a vaccine - it is gene therapy.

If I have to get a third booster shot  to increase immunity against the Delta variant or the one to follow it that is brewing in our large unvaxxed population so be it. The only thing I would suggest is that a deadline be set to be fully vaccinated and all those who remain unvaccinated after that date get charged for hospitalization, no insurance coverage."

My husband and I, both over 65, got our shots at a major hospital system/chain this winter. The intake person recorded all of our insurance info (traditional Medicare and supplement). We even get fundraising letters from the chain now so we're definitely in their system. We weren't billed, didn't get an EOB, and our online Medicare records have no reference to the vaxxing.

To date, there has not been any discussion of those that acquired natural herd immunity to this illness (which if people would understand contributes to overall herd immunity) and no discussion of effective alternative treatments (ivermectin-low cost and currently being banned and information on it suppressed)for those that cannot or will not be able to vaccinate. I have a family friends child whose doctor already forbid the gene therapy for her son. Moreover-there is ZERO discussion of the bioethics of new technology used on children who will likely bear the cost of unapproved medical gene therapy. This door to door program is unpractical. If people want to vaccinate, do it, leave those that don't other alternative treatments such as ivermectin, etc. Not everyone can take gene therapy nor is everyone comfortable with such technology. Its incredible that this great country with a wide range of research capacity and resources can only rely on a product that still does not prevent transmission of said illness. And lastly, there has been no discussion of the overall health of the citizens of this country that needs help."
2021-07-05 11:38,"I think Biden deserves full credit for the literally unbelievable rapid development by American companies of the vaccines that have saved America from Covid.   As a senator and a candidate, he pushed hard for getting the government red tape disregarded that had caused the fastest previous vaccine, the mumps vaccine, to take 6 years to get to market after research began.   Joe knew that this time was different, that the CDC and FDA could be sclerotic in there requirements with little disregard for the risk reward calculus of vaccine safety versus benefit.   He knew that drug companies were the real heroes that would safe the day as they pursue massive but well earned profits from a successful vaccine.  Joe know that a decentralized vaccine rollout use state and local governments and private pharmacy chains would be way more successful than the centralized government approach Europe failed with.  Joe deserves the credit.  He is a formidable intellect of outstanding action."

2021-07-05 23:08,"Indeed! Perhaps for the first time for years I've  relished  to hear the politician numbered  one in the country, spoke in instinctive tone of credibility and righteousness; seen him  humble, humane, down-to-the-earth, no demagogy, gerrymandering, vaunting and dejavu! When Joe Biden took over the Oval office, January  2021, the country reported record number of Covid-death exceeding 79000 and Covid-hospitalization over 108000 in seven-day-average! Ever since the President went all out to fight off the scourge, number of cases of infection and death with the disease on last June in seven-day-average, came drastically down to 32,411 and 560 respectively, according to the CDC. The President minced no words to reflect  his mind ""Today while the virus has not been vanquished, we know this: It no longer controls our lives, it no longer paralyzes our Nation. And it s within our power to make sure--it never does again."""
2021-07-02 16:20,"No, you have to take into account that the CDC estimates for every one case detected 3 go undetected. Based on that a huge number of Americans have immunity due to having had covid. Sure there is some overlap there with vaccinated people, but it’s not a total overlap. Then take into account that covid barely registers in the vast majority of young kids. Together should be a significant percentage either immune or at extremely low risk."
2021-07-02 16:21,MMR vaccines are mandated for schools - why shouldn't Covid vaccines be mandated (with exceptions for health reasons)? No one complains about vaccines for polio. This country will not be out of the woods until considerably more citizens are vaccinated. Public service messages and local bribes (lotteries etc.) have pretty much done as much as they can. Public health should not be a political volleyball.
2021-07-02 16:22,"All the Science is quite clear on this subject.

If you are fully vaccinated and basically healthy your risk of infection is very low, your risk of any kind of serious illness infinitesimal and your risk of passing it on to others similarly unlikely.  

Moreover children under 12 are far less likely to contract or spread the disease and really unlikely to have serious illness. 

Given vaccine is available everywhere the only adult people at risk are those who foolishly refuse vaccine. 

And because when you account for natural immunity we essentially have roughly 75% of the population with immunity at this point there will be no more widespread out of control COVID 19 outbreaks that require shutdowns and mask mandates.

The President is not ""getting ahead of himself"" or ""over his skis"" to declare America is entitled too a well deserved victory lap. 

This is Science, not Politics."
2021-07-02 17:00,"Too soon?   I don't think so.

 There are vaccines available for everyone 12 and up; I'm hoping that all school-age children can be vaccinated by late summer so that schools can safely have full classes next year.

Like others, I hope these vaccines receive full approval soon so that employers and school districts can require them just as they require other vaccines."
2021-07-02 16:14,Unfortunately we aren’t “back together.”  We haven’t been this divided since the American civil war.  Trump did a great job of dividing us into warring tribes.  Some president.
2021-07-02 16:23,Do we have to see again the banner “ mission accomplished “ prematurely? Biden administration did good job with COVID vaccination but only 50% or little more Americans are vaccinated. We have not acquired herd immunity. Tourists and foreigners are bringing Delta variants. CDC has not explained everything. We are confused and apprehensive.
2021-07-02 16:27,"We will only be independent from the virus when 70-80% of ALL Americans are vaccinated.

We are not even close to independence.

As usual, the republicans are botching our independence by not getting vaccinated, and we still need to vaccinate eleven year olds and less.

Never mind that the rest of the world is still a mess and vaccinations are too far behind the U.S. to fully declare independence."
2021-07-02 16:30,Do you realize how many people already had Covid ? It’s an alarmingly high number. News flash they’re also protected. Add that to vaccinated and you have few vulnerable remaining most of whom are choosing to be vulnerable.
2021-07-02 16:34,"Let’s listen to the experts.  As far as I know, the Prez is not a virologist."
2021-07-02 16:43,"I guess as long as Nevada is left out of the party...

News item (today):
LAS VEGAS (KTNV) — Over the last two weeks, there's been a steady increase in the number of daily COVID-19 cases throughout Nevada. The state's test positivity rate has also been on the rise, now up to 5.5%. It's even higher in Southern Nevada at 5.8%.

Meanwhile, the more contagious Delta variant is spreading in Clark County. The Southern Nevada Health District (SNHD) says it has diagnosed 146 cases so far, which accounts for 16% of all cases since the variant was discovered in Southern Nevada. Officials say they are not currently considering bringing back restrictions like capacity limits and mask mandates."
2021-07-02 16:59,"Joe Biden has made great strides forward in tackling COVID19, however all world leaders need to be mindful of the danger of the Delta variant and any other potentially more deadly variants which arise in the future.
You cannot just declare victory against the virus when the Delta variant is so contagious and deadly. Just look at the huge loss of life and trauma in India. Look also at the UK, where the Johnson government, who failed to introduce quarantine measures in April against travellers returning from India, has seeded an escalating infection rate of over 27,000 cases per day, with continuing deaths and hospital admissions. This is a very serious crisis which is getting worse every day.
The Delta variant is deadly to those not vaccinated and can make other people very unwell. This is not a dose of flu which the UK government keep pushing in the media in an attempt to brainwash the population into accepting that COVID19 cannot be defeated.
The responsibility of governments is to keep people safe."
2021-07-02 17:09,"Of course Biden and the rest of the country are jumping the gun and eventually will be gravely wounded by it. The country is less than half fully vaccinated. The Delta variant is going to burn through the other half, just as Trump originally wished for the whole country. Meanwhile, Americans are flying off abroad and sailing off on cruises. NBC and the rest of the sports marketing juggernaut are cramming the Olympics down the throat of Japan which is less than 20% vaccinated; is Samantha Guthrie going to cover it from home in upstate New York? No one wants to pressure Republican vaccine holdouts with mandatory shots through vaccine passports or outright mockery because it may hurt their feelings and keep them from doing something they never intend to do. Reading between the lines, by now the minority of Americans who are vaccinated and relatively safe from Delta are saying let the chips fall where they certainly will for those unwilling to get free, fully accessible vaccines. They will only  have sympathy and pity for long-suffering health care workers who will again be slammed by beds full of patients, this time mostly ignorant ones."
2021-07-02 17:10,"We have two Americas right now. One America is full of people who have listened to the science and have been vaccinated. The other America is full of people who either think the virus is altogether fake or that God will protect them from it. 

If Joe Biden wants to declare victory, he needs to have a serious national discussion about reality. My county has a 26% vaccination rate and surrounding counties are at 20% and 24%. The vaccine is widely available here and has been for 3 months now. What’s going on right now in this alternate universe that overlaps the real universe is not okay. These people are putting everyone at risk by not getting vaccinated! What are we going to do when the virus keeps spreading and mutates into something that evades the current vaccine?"
2021-07-02 17:25,"The problem in the U.S. is that a substantial part of the population is not getting vaccinated even though it is free. As a result, we are not meeting targets, and are not only not ""independent of the virus"", but vulnerable to both the main strain and variants, especially delta.

The problem can be illustrated by comparing vaccination buy-in in the U.S. and Canada next door.

Biden's target was partial vaccination of 70% of people 18 and older by July 4. By mid-June, it was clear that this target would not be met. Consequently, on June 23 the Administration trumpeted that 75% of people 30 and older had received a first shot and declared victory.

Meanwhile, on the same day Canada, which had tight supply because it does not manufacture these vaccines, had already partially vaccinated 75% of the population age 12 and older. With the resolution of its supply problem over the last few weeks, it now appears that Canada will pass the U.S. on percentage of the population fully vaccinated sometime in July/August.

The question here is, how do we get to ""independence from the virus"" when the rate of vaccination is not only not increasing, but slowing?"
2021-07-02 17:26,"While I sympathize with the celebratory encouraging notion the President is trying to convey, I do think that declaring the pandemic over at this point is premature and politically likely to blow up in his face as the numbers of cases and deaths tick upward and vaccination rates stay stubbornly flat in big parts of the South, Midwest and rural West. Most states are fully “open” but not because they have met targets for vaccination. The risk is still substantial in places. It isn’t too late for President Biden to dial back the “return to normal” talk and instead celebrate progress so far.

I also note that it seems tone deaf when our neighbors in Central and South America and in most of the rest of the world are still being devastated by COVD and don’t have access to vaccines that work. If we were so exceptional as a people, we would be focused on improving the logistics and delivery of vaccines way beyond what we are now."
2021-07-02 17:28,Anyone who wants the vaccine can get the vaccine. That’s about as close to “mission accomplished” as the Biden Administration needs to get in order to celebrate.
2021-07-02 17:14,This goes either way. Whichever direction he played this undoubtedly criticism and doubt would follow. The script NEVER gets old with unlimited rewrites and sequels
2021-07-02 17:27,"If this was Trump declaring victory, dems and liberals would be all over him for ignoring the medical professionals continued warnings and recommendations. Politics and economics seem to still be steering the bus. Peoples’ criticisms and reactions just come down to whether the bus driver has a red or blue uniform."
2021-07-02 17:33,"On December 2nd Dr. Fauci predicted that by late March to early April, every American who wanted to be vaccinated could walk into their local pharmacy and get vaccinated.  That was basically accomplished thanks to the pharmaceutical industry in conjunction with the CDC and other federal agencies.  Yes, Trump was president during Operation Warp Speed but he had little to do with it.

Likewise, President Biden was president during the incredible efforts to get the most vulnerable Americans vaccinated during 2021.  Again that was due coordination of the CDC and pharmaceutical industry.  Yes, Biden has been president during this period.

For either president to act as if it was their personal victory indicates more for their own ego satisfaction and mental problems while diminishing the fine efforts of our CDC and pharmaceutical industry."
2021-07-02 18:56,The pandemic is over for the people who are vaccinated. I don’t feel bad for the adults who choose not to get vaccinated. It’s a very simple choice.
2021-07-02 19:02,"I am fully vaccinated and, in my opinion, I now speak of the pandemic in the past tense. I no longer need a mask, to enter my office, to shop, or to walk around. Everything I did before March of 2020 is now allowed, free of any restrictions. The pandemic is undoubtedly over, regardless of what some may think."
2021-07-02 19:06,"We should be celebrating the fact that every eligible person in the US who wants a vaccine can get one. We should be celebrating the fact that the vaccines are highly effective. We should be celebrating the great progress from a year ago.

That doesn’t mean we aren’t also mourning the dead and those permanently scarred by the pandemic or that we aren’t paying attention to the concerns of the variants and the frustrating hesitation among so many Americans to get vaccinated. 

President Biden and Dr. Fauci and the CDC are not saying COVID is over or that all precautions can be thrown out the window. They’re saying we’ve come a long way. And we have. That’s worth celebrating."
2021-07-02 17:49,"Biden is absolutely correct to celebrate the winding down of the pandemic.

195,032 -- Seven-day average of new infections in US on Jan 20
12,809 -- Seven-day average of new infections in US on July 1

(Biden took Office on January 20, 2021.)"
2021-07-02 18:43,"Can't say Stolberg and the Times didn't put  us on notice that celebrating at half time won't win a game. 
Stats reveal that a better vaccinated UK is on a vertical Delta virus surge now 6x the case count of a hardly a month ago.
July 4th celebrations, like peeing in one's pants, produce only a brief warm feeling. 
Biden should read this and temper his half time speech to a nation that in truth is quite a few touchdowns short of victory while playing with half the squad on the bench in denial that there is even a contest in progress. 
Joe should warn the bench warmers that it's ""game over"" unless they get off their back sides."
2021-07-02 17:38,We'll see in several months.....
2021-07-02 17:40,"Sorry, but I have no burning desire or need to be with a group of unvaccinated people this holiday or any other.

Some people are looking for the easy way out of this horrible pandemic and just don't want to do what has already been proven to work.. masks and vaccines. 

Those who defiantly refuse masking and vaccines get no sympathy from me.   I certainly understand there are people who are unable to be vaccinated.   They too are at risk from those who spout anti-vaxx propaganda and are trying to make a political point by risking their lives. 

As much as President Biden would like us to be at the end of this pandemic, I don't think we are. 

It is certainly not his fault that those areas with low vaccine rates refuse to take advantage of any of the vaccines that have been made available. 

Science seems to prove that those low vaccine rates and non masking equals higher infection and mortality rates.

My vaccinated self and family refuse to take that chance.

😷😷😷😷😷😷😷😷😷"
2021-07-02 18:06,"At the risk of sounding crass--where's the downside to vaccine refusal? Those too lacking in mental or emotional acuity to protect themselves will face a higher mortality rate than those of us who are sensible and paying attention. I suspect that many or most of the unvaxed are Trump supporters. If so, then there's the icing to that cake.

Again, I realize this sounds positively, icily uncaring. But, my attitude is the product of a simple reaction to the arrogance and--frankly--stupidity of many who consciously chose to support a narcissistic, psychopathic, sexist, racist demagogue. If these people choose to put themselves at greater risk, why stand in their way? Let them have what they want. Evolution stands poised to start selecting against them. To put a spin on Edmund Burke, in this one particular circumstance, the only thing necessary for the triumph of good is for good men to do nothing."
2021-07-02 18:17,"It seems that politics dictates: Trump, Biden... what a disaster of government eaders we have."
2021-07-02 18:19,"Half the country wants to live in the Middle Ages, when the sun revolved around the earth and the earth was flat. Perhaps they'd like to bring back the leeches. It's time for an amicable divorce with the border wall that they want. But they  can't cross the border without proof of vaccination."
2021-07-02 18:33,"You know, negative reporting isn’t really reporting, it’s just poisonous rhetoric. Kushner said in 2020 that we would be “rocking it that summer” and thousands of Americans died. That is where you should put your energy, in making those who detailed our response accountable. The delta variant is because of them, the lies and falsehoods that cause vaccine hesitation. Biden delivered what he promised, it’s nothing his fault that Republican voters bought into the lies and are now paying with their life. Maybe write an article calling on Republicans to take care of themselves instead of questioning the opportunity to celebrate success to date. Do better. Report the news down try to create it."
2021-07-02 18:57,"Remember the Covid superspreader event the former guy held in the Rose Garden on 26 September to announce his nomination of Judge Amy Coney Barrett for the SCOTUS? So many maskless guests fell ill with the virus. Even #45, First Lady Melania and their son Barron caught it at the White House.

President Joe Biden is hosting Independence Day celebrations at the White House on Sunday July 4. Is our divided country free of the virus? Chances are great that Independence Day will be another Coronavirus superspreader. The 2nd year of the Spanish Flu was more virulent than the first year."
2021-07-02 17:33,He's not wrong.   COVID vaccines are wildly successful.  What's wrong is too many people not getting themselves protected.  I hope the vaccines get regular FDA approval soon so that vaccine misinformation can finally be drowned out.
2021-07-02 17:48,"Until my elementary school aged daughter is vaccinated, our family is on full alert. Thankfully we are so used to wearing masks that it shouldn't be hard to go another few months this way. Her school is already stating they are no longer requiring masks on the playground - what good is wearing a mask in the classroom to only have some child with COVID cough in your face on the monkey bars? Really have to watch every step of the way, people forget the less-than-12 year old ground has no protection, and assume they can go back to normal. This doesn't end until we get a shot in her arm."
2021-07-02 18:13,"I don't know why I expected Biden to be different from all the other presidents we've had. I'm gullible. The guy voted for the Iraq War and Clarence Thomas. 

I think he's failing as a leader in the global fight against the pandemic. Sure he's shipping out vaccines albeit rather slowly and often with the vaccines that no one wants (J&J sent to Mexico). That's easy. America has the ability to spend tons of money on credit. 

But he's incapable of showing leadership when it comes to the hard things like a global push for vaccine passports, requiring Americans to be vaccinated before leaving the country, and even requiring Americans to test negative before leaving the country so that they don't infect the rest of the world. He doesn't know how to talk to Americans about their own responsibility. This pandemic isn't going to end for a looooong time. 

His playbook with China is the same as the one Trump used and it's moving us into another Cold War. For most Americans poor relations with China is unimportant, but for those like me who work in international education, it is a huge deal."
2021-07-02 18:20,"Hubris is hubris, no matter who indulges in it. 
I’ve just returned from India, where I nursed various fully vaccinated family members through the delta version infection, before getting sick myself. 
While we only suffered mild illness, it drove home how vulnerable we really are. 
I cannot help but be reminded of how Modi was crowing in January, and the country suffered for his hubris. Hope it isn’t a pattern repeated in the US."
2021-07-02 18:54,"As long as the vaccine protects me, I really do not care about those who refuse to take the vaccine.

I used to care, but when they stopped caring about me, I stopped caring about them.

That is Trump's ( who if not President probably would have died from Covid) legacy.

At the moment, Biden should be declaring, and make a point, that the vaccinated have ""independence from the virus"".

Everyone else refusing to be vaccinated?  You have the independence to play Russian roulette with your lives."
2021-07-02 18:58,We are insisting on making the same mistakes over and over again. That is the definition of insanity.
2021-07-02 18:39,"I get why Biden’s doing this: he has to, politically speaking—and don’t dismiss that; politics should be there to help the good guys get stuff done—but, and it’s a big but, my cheap soothsaying is that we will inevitably see a combo of England and Australia.

Let me be clear.

We WILL see big areas where the Delta variant spreads very quickly, and these WILL mostly be areas where vaccination rates are low.

One hopes that the way vaccinations jumped after January, plus a lot of folks who were infected and have at least some temporary immunity of some sort, has gotten us to herd immunity levels. More or less, anyway. 

But we ARE going to see a bunch of very sick, and very dead, Americans. It’s just that this time, the main culprits won’t be the President and his staff."
2021-07-02 18:29,"Touting ""partly vaccinated"" numbers as a measure of success is insidious.  It deceptively encourages some to forgo the second shot with dangerous results.

Studies show that the first shot provides only 10% of required antibodies and no T-cells.  It is the second shot that counts, providing 90% of antibodies and all T-cells.

I am saddened by this PR tactic by the new administration, whom I had hoped would be as pragmatic and grounded as they aspire to be.

Yet another PR-created problem: not including all humans in the 70% goal.  That includes American children as well as adults and children world wide.  That's what herd immunity requires when we share a planet.

We are nowhere near the end of this tunnel."
2021-07-02 17:15,"Highly effective vaccines that remain strong against all variants are available to anyone over 12 in the US. A large amount of people here have been vaccinated, and a significant amount have immunity from natural infection. Cases have been decoupled from hospitalizations and deaths, and it seems very unlikely, at this point, that covid-19 is a major threat to US hospital capacity, which is why we had unprecedented, large-scale government restrictions on our lives in the first place. 

With how effective our vaccines are, and the fact that immunity from natural infection also seems to be long-lasting, it’s absurd to call this “halftime” for covid in the US. Let’s not allow mission creep to happen and fall for the tempting, but entirely unrealistic, zero-Covid, one-case-is-too-many type of thinking, and instead acknowledge that in the US we’ve defanged the virus and turned it into a seasonal respiratory illness that’s just another ordinary risk that we live our ordinary lives against. I think that’s worth celebrating. The vaccines are amazing!"

2021-07-02 18:23,"Yes, it's time to move on. A substantial percentage of the population has been fully vaccinated, especially those in the at-risk age categories. And except for youngsters, nearly everyone has had the opportunity to become vaccinated.

To those who refuse to be vaccinated, you assume the risk. But it seems foolish to allow those refusing the vaccination, often for political reasons, to hold hostage the economy and a return to normalcy.

And to those who say we need to maintain mask mandates and social distance a bit longer until the vaccination numbers increase, I would suggest that the numbers are never going to reach what some had hoped for."
2021-07-02 18:27,In this period where elections are often very close wouldn't it be interesting if Republicans fail to achieve control of the House and Senate in 2022 because of COVID. Republicans have a far greater percentage of anti-vaxers and viral variants with increased infectivity are expected in fall and winter months. A larger number of  deaths or of voters to ill  to make it to the polls could therefore effect results in close races. Republican attempts to limit voting by mail could also conceivably cost them as many of the sick could have otherwise voted in this way.
2021-07-02 18:41,"Less than a majority of Americans have received full vaccination, but much of that is because the 22% of Americans under the age of 12 do not have an approved vaccine to receive. Fortunately for them, covid has been more of a bad flu year than a pandemic.

Of those 12 and over, more than a majority have received full protection, and almost two thirds have had at least one shot. There is llenty of vaccine supply available to provide for everyone e,se, so to say that those who have done the responsible thing should not enjoy its benefits is simply ludicrous.

And besides, a vaccine is not the only way to receive protection. Over 10% of the country has already covid, and the actual number is probably more like 20%. Some of them have undoubtably taken the vaccine as an extra precaution, but many have not.

Better to slowly open up for those protected, keep up the pressure for the others to get vaccinated, and spend some resources to help neighboring countries."
2021-07-02 17:32,"No. Anyone who wants to get vaccinated either has been vaccinated or is going to get vaccinated. The vaccines work against the variants, and case numbers and deaths keep dropping. Anyone who wants to keep wearing a mask and stay indoors can do so, let the rest of us get on with life."

With all due respect to Joe Biden, this opening sentence is something Donald Trump would have done and would have been vilified for.

What the heck is this Administration thinking?  Only 47% of the country is fully vaccinated.  Now is not the time to act with such reckless abandonment.  

Wishing and acting this virus away will NOT help eradicate it nor prevent the spreading of it or the Delta variant.

I think this is a terrible mistake by President Biden."
2021-07-02 20:00,"The pandemic isn’t over yet.  I’m afraid we’re only in the bottom of the 5th/top of the 6th inning of a 9-inning ballgame.

The Delta variant is now in every state in the US, and it will spread in those communities with low vaccination rates.  I’m very concerned that those communities will see a significant increase in hospitalizations and deaths in approximately 6-8 weeks.  Just like it spread through India and then the UK, it likely will do so here in those communities with low vaccination rates.  The Delta variant is more transmissible and leads to more serious health issues.

And then I read in The NY Times recently that there is a new variant now in India called Delta Plus.  If Delta is  Covid on steroids, Delta Plus is Delta on steroids.

Unfortunately, the pandemic is not close to being over yet."

I want to thank the NY Times collumnists for calling all of us litearlly millions who couldn't or still can't get vaxed, ""ignorant,"" ""un-American"", backwards, hateful, and many other jeers. It's peopel like you that let Delta run free with no maskers and don't give a damn about the 50% of the country that is still unvaccinated for one reason or another - half of them kids who aren't allowed to yet. Delta is especially bad with children.  Israel - half of the poeple with delta were fully vaxed. UK - 75% of the population vaxed and seeing a horrible delta outbreak.

Half of the country is still not vaccinated and there is an incredibly infectious (RO can be as much as 8) variant that is spreading.  We still don’t know what long term effects even a mild infection can have on the fully vaccinated.  There are 600,000 dead Americans, so far, and the virus is spreading domestically and worldwide creating new variants that could be even worse.

This moment should be solemn and serious.  

You are the President for ALL Americans … even the crazy unvaccinated ones.  I don’t know who may be pushing you to do this but I think you should stop listening to them."

2021-07-02 21:03,"There are still on average 300 Americans a day dying of COVID.   That is 100,000  a year dead.  I’d say this pandemic is far from over. If you aren’t vaccinated you need to make that appointment."
2021-07-02 19:41,"America needs a celebration of the progress we’ve made, July 4th is the perfect time to do it. Joe and his team have done an amazing job fighting Covid, and outdoors events have long been shown to not have much threat anyway. At some point the country (and journalism) needs to move past the doom and gloom narrative."
2021-07-02 19:49,"Anyone who wants to be vaccinated in the U.S. can get vaccinated, so it is Independence Day for those who choose to be responsible.  Most Trumplicans will NEVER listen to science or President Biden.  Rational people need to get vaccinated so that they are healthy enough to vote in 2022.  With the Delta variant out there, within 3-6 months, the rest will see the light--albeit involuntarily and possibly from the River Styx."
2021-07-02 21:34,"Why don't they have vaccination campaigns ala WW2, Big posters everywhere, DO YOUR PART, GET VACCINATED, BE PATRIOTIC GET VACCINATED, CARE ABOUT YOUR FELLOW CITIZENS, GET VACCINATED. If they posed it as a patriotic duty to get your vaccine and wear a mask, then maybe more would do it. 
It isn't over yet, but the Government need to get people who are knowledgeable in phycology to better convince people to get vaccinated. The people in the government needs to infiltrate QANON and start spreading the message that vaccinated people have better sex or something. LOL"
2021-07-02 21:36,"White conservatives in the Southern states seem the most obstinate against vaccination.  Well, it is not surprising, and I thought it could actually be worse:   I thought they would get vaccinated but do everything in their power to stop blacks from getting vaccinated too."
2021-07-02 21:43,"I am a physician who takes care of Covid patients, and also a medical researcher. The public needs to understand:
1) Viruses mutate. There are billions of viral particles circulating of this Covid-19 virus, some of which develop vaccination resistance.
2) As long as the Covid virus is being transmitted from person to person, even with those who are not infected, the virus continues to have the ability to mutate and resist control from current vaccines.
3) Although the Covid cases in the United States are remarkably low right now, it is summer. When people spend more time together in the cooler weather in the coming fall, greater opportunities to spread the disease will occur.
4) Other countries have atrocious numbers of persons with the disease. Due to the lack of airtight isolation of the United States from international travel, the virus and its mutation variants will continue to enter the US. 

I expect there will be a resurgence of the virus this fall. New mutations may be unable to be controlled by the current vaccines. I therefore expect increased disease, long-haul survivors, and deaths, to say nothing of congesting our hospitals, straining our medical care personnel, and havoc on our economy, education system, public services. There are sizable pockets in the US of people who refuse to be vaccinated, including here in Alabama. People from pockets will continue to travel about, spreading disease."
2021-07-02 21:27,"Our family is fully vaccinated, as are our friends. Yet my doctor advised me to continue to wear a mask when shopping indoors and, when eating out, to choose outdoor locations.

Why is that? That is because, particularly for people in my age group, the Delta variant is causing breakthrough infections, albeit not serious enough to require hospitalizations. Nonetheless, fevers as high as 105 degrees have been reported - this from my MD, a senior physician at a major NYC medical center.

Given that possibility, as well as the risk of new variants posed by the many NYers and other Americans who, for irrational reasons, refuse to be vaccinated, I believe that, yes, it is “too soon” to declare victory over COVID.  Assuming no vaccine-busting variant develops, fewer people will be hospitalized or die - but even the vaccinated may get sick. In areas where vaccination rates are low, the risks are higher, due to the increased potential for exposure to an infected person.  

As for the people who refuse vaccination - a good friend, a scientist, remarked recently, “The sooner they are gone, the better.”  She was, of course, speaking from a public safety, not moral perspective. But are people really willing to sacrifice their lives in the service of political conviction? Or are they just stupid?

Ironically, many of those who refuse to acknowledge the reality of evolution - survival of the fittest - may soon become new evidence of that theory."
2021-07-02 19:34,"Over the past several weeks as the Delta variant has become more widespread daily Covid deaths in NYC are  in the single digits and the number of new hospitalizations has been relatively steady.

In England, where the Delta variant now accounts for most cases, epidemiological data released on Thursday showed that it was not driving any surge in the rate of hospitalizations.

So for all the fear mongers, take your nervous energy and direct towards people not getting vaccinated. That's where the trouble lies, not with vaccinated people celebrating."
2021-07-02 20:49,"I was ecstatic 1/20 thru 7/1 because Biden never sounded like 
Trump.  But now he starts with the happy talks.

News flash:  No virus, let alone this sneaky monster, pays any attention to happy talk.

Fortunately, the tools exist for every adult American to protect her/himself.  

Vaccine = 90% effective.
Vaccine + medical grade mask = 99.9% effective.

Mild COVID breakthrough cases have already led to long-term COVID symptoms

My mask is my seat belt.  My vaccination is my airbag.  Protected by both.
Don't be the last person to die in this war, or be disabled by long-haul Covid."
2021-07-02 19:41,Two words:  Vaccine mandates.
2021-07-02 19:39,"It is political malpractice to declare “victory,” while Americans are still dying."
2021-07-02 20:06,"President Biden is just recognizing reality.  The Covid infection rates are way, way down.  Mask mandates are being removed.  It's becoming safe to resume activities that we had to abandon the last year and a half.

It's necessary to remain vigilant, to keep encouraging people to get vaccinated.  We certainly need to help the rest of the world get vaccinated to prevent mutations from spreading.  But we also need to move on because we can't sustain a level of high alert forever, and trying to do so will end up being counter-productive."
2021-07-02 19:01,"I blame the media partly. When Trump was President they were announcing every day deaths from the pandemic. When Biden came in all pandemic deaths disappeared from the headlines . More than 200,000 Americans have died from the virus since Biden took over. But you don't hear boo about it.  Without those headlines people may believe the pandemic is over.   Of course the White House doesn't want to remind people about bad news, doesn't make to good politics."
2021-07-02 20:21,Biden the great has ended the virus or at least he is trying to take credit for what his predecessor left him which was a working vaccine program that only became available much sooner than the scientists predicted because of Presidential prodding coupled with financial incentives where needed and Operation Warp Speed that included a distribution plan in place that was ramping up as Biden was sworn and reached 1 million doses per day administered and rising daily.
2021-07-02 21:25,It’s hard to muster any concern for the willfully unvaccinated — my heart is with the medically vulnerable children who could be hurt or killed by their selfishness.
2021-07-02 20:42,"Too soon? A matter of opinion I suppose.  If I contrast Biden's manner as POTUS versus Trump's regarding the pandemic it's night and day.  Trump got Covid in October 2020 - he was in the hospital for 3 days.  He also refused to concede that he lost the election and January 6, 2021 the symbol of our democracy was overtake by our citizens who desecrated and destroyed property and lives were lost and bodies were maimed.    

A sense of celebration is appropriate now and I plan to celebrate this Fourth of July especially since we have returned from the brink.  President Biden, it has a nice ring to it."
2021-07-02 21:16,"Vaccines are free and widely available at this point. Those who don’t have them have decided to risk infection, and we owe them nothing, and they have no right to expect us to protect them. Conservatives love “personal responsibility” and those vaccine skeptics will simply have to live, or die, with the consequences of their choices."
2021-07-02 21:26,"I am so sick of the Times not publishing my comments. 

This is our ‘ new normal’. Risk has always been part of life. Those of us who are vaccinated shouldn't have to  continue to miss out on things in our lives bc of the choices of others. 

Everyone ( except children  under 12)  has now had opportunity. It is fair game to have things open. 

As an aside, life is short. Enjoy what incredibly short time you have left. There will and always has been, risk. The idea of things being ‘ safe’ Is an illusion. Things might be ‘safer’ but one needs to be very specific as to what they are referring to. Safer than what exactly?"
2021-07-02 21:37,"Bidon is right to move on.
While the pandemic goes on in some sense, the major risk was over 2 weeks ago, and no longer exists for the vaccinated.
There will be reservoirs of Covid in various forms somewhere on earth for the foreseeable future, and a flight a day will land from there near all of us.  This is not a reason to keep masking up.  This is a guarantee that everyone will be exposed again - the vaccinated will become even more immune, the unvaccinated may get sick, perhaps severely sick, but as long as numbers are low we should go on with life.
This is the desired result we all worked towards - sad the vaccine hesitant can’t get themselves seize victory with the rest of us, but they will end up immune through disease."
2021-07-02 22:44,"Most folks who are vaccinated are indeed mostly independent of the virus. Those who choose to not get vaccinated are on their own and I care not a whit about them. I am concerned about those who cannot get vaccinated, and still practice social distancing, and wear my mask in grocery stores, doctors’ offices, and other places where I might come into contact with those folks. I can only do so much…"
2021-07-02 23:05,"This article is timely as I was just writing to my friends about this. As a professional molecular biologist with a degree in Microbiology, I was informing them that now is *not* the time to let our guard down as the Delta variant is increasing exponentially in the USA. Delta is increasing even more quickly in states ""under-represented"" for vaccinations, e.g., Alabama,  Louisiana, Arkansas, Tennessee, Wyoming & Mississippi. There are statistically valid correlations with these states & the increase of Delta. You only have to look at the increase in the U.K to see what will happen here. 

By my math, we are about 1 month behind the curve shown for the U.K. My prediction is by mid-July, 50% of cases will be Delta variant in the U.S., and by early August, it will be close to 85-90%. All this is due to one simple thing: significant proportions of USA not being vaccinated. My guidance to friends: mask up when out & about & don't know the vaccination status of others. I personally don't agree with current CDC guidance, issued before Delta became prevalent, that fully immunized individuals do not need to wear masks in public. LA County DPH recommends everyone, even vaccinated people, wear a mask indoors, noting Delta variant accounts for ~ 50% of variants in the county. They're correct. In states w/o motorcycle helmet laws, where someone can drink & jump on a motorcycle w/o a helmet & ride off, we can't trust the public as a whole to do the right thing. Because they don't."
2021-07-02 21:56,I wouldn't worry about sending the wrong message to people.  The people who are at risk this weekend and into the future are those who refused to acknowledge the earlier message about vaccination.  They will continue to tax the healthcare system in red states.  They will live and die with the consequences of their decisions.  Myself? I plan to enjoy the holiday with vaccinated friends and family.
2021-07-02 22:02,"“We’re still in the middle of this marathon,” said Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious disease expert at Vanderbilt University. Despite considerable progress in decreasing the number of coronavirus cases and deaths in the United States over the past few months, he said, it remains too early to “unfurl the ‘mission accomplished’ banner.”

Just pay attention to what is happening in other countries. 

While I’m certain that Trump supporters will mock me, I plan to continue to wear a face mask indoors."
2021-07-02 22:41,"I hate to say this but you can bet your bottom dollar that you will not be reading such positive articles as this 2 to 3 weeks from now . Other countries with high vaccination rates and populations that respect the rules and restrictions that their governments have put in place are now seeing cases increase in large numbers .Many Americans do what they think is best for themselves regardless of the rules and now those same rules are being relaxed . Newcastle in England had a great start to the vaccination process but now that the vaccinations have slowed they have moved from being a success story to 10th worst at the start of this week to the worst hit in England today , and judging by postings in the local paper many are treating the information as fake news .Bars with outdoor beer gardens are packed with people watching the Euros and hugging and kissing with every goal , London stations were packed with Scots coming down for a game .So if celebration and travel in the UK mean such a high increase in cases why would we presume that the same will not happen in North America . Canada has passed the US in total vaccinations after being well behind and the UK has done 17% more total vaccinations than the US . So take care and get vaccinated if you have not done so and don't let what has happened elsewhere happen in the US ."
2021-07-02 22:42,The Biden Administration has implemented vaccine program developed by the Trump Administration. Credit should go to the pharmaceutical industry( especially Pfizer and Moderna) the health care industry and the specialists who organized operation Warp Speed.
2021-07-02 21:55,The “all clear” status that the fully vaxxed believe they have seems premature.  The breakthrough infections and widespread abandonment of masks and social distancing are concerning.  I suspect lockdowns will reappear in this country by late fall or winter.
2021-07-02 23:06,"Way too soon, Joe. America may be somewhat back together but the rest of the world is not even close. There's no declaring this a done deal til a reasonable amount of the rest of the world is vaccinated. Otherwise we are just reinforcing our usual isolationist stance."
2021-07-02 22:29,"Biden is doing the right thing under the circumstances.
The places where the pandemic is NOT under control are all in Trump country, where the governors refuse to listen to Biden and have already opened things up.  
It is still essential that people in MS, LA, WY, ID, and AL, where less than 40% have even one dose, get vaccinated.  But we cannot let their paranoia and irresponsibility prevent the rest of the country from recovering."
2021-07-02 22:02,"When it comes to viruses like this, vaccines and the mantra of, ""prevention is better than cure"" is insufficient. The cost and personal sacrifices due to expected behavioral change are just too high. Especially if prolonged. For once, we actually need bona fide cures which can be applied to the relative handful that actually get hospitalised. This way, everyone can just continue living their lives as normal (the real normal we knew). The question is, can innovations in medical science keep pace or is the primary ""solution"" going to cost the world tens of trillions of dollars each time (including millions of deaths too anyway)."
2021-07-02 23:24,"Less than half the country is fully vaccinated because, ummm.... ""freedom.""  That is freedom to be ignorant, arrogant, indignant, indecisive.  There is no excuse for the vast majority to not be vaccinated by now.  Freedom to get sick and die appears to be a closely-held American value."
2021-07-02 22:54,Is Biden declaring independence too soon? Answer: No he is not.  Everyone who wants to can get vaccinated. End of story.

2021-07-02 21:58,"""Mission accomplished""!

41% of TX is fully vaccinated; in my county, 52% are fully vaccinated. 

Rarely do I see people wearing masks. 

I guess this means that when delta arrives, properties will become more available (if Blackstone doesn't snap them up first). I keep hoping for property taxes to go down.

Biden is jumping the gun. Hopefully he'll take Abbott down with him."
2021-07-02 23:19,"The Biden Administration is taking a big risk for the future of the Democratic party with his ""America's Back Together"" celebrations if the celebrations only become super spreader events for COVID-21 Delta when a large group of people --especially unvaccinated children under 12--might not be hospitalized or die, but are disabled as long haulers. The administration is continuing on the dangerous road of politicizing COVID which the Republicans will use against the Democratic party in the future."

If you resist vaccinating, and don't mask and distance indoors, you deserve what's coming to you. I just feel bad for your innocent victims like little kids and your immuno-compromised parents."
2021-07-02 23:28,"Once we get under 12 approval we’ll pretty much be at the point where if you get covid, it will be your own fault. Vaccination rates of 65  are high enough everywhere to make another death wave very unlikely. Biden is right to be declaring victory."

What if they’re as fit as a fiddle???  I know that science says they will all die in droves, but what if they don’t???  Can you imagine the political— and geographic — divide??  Unvaccinated people will be very contemptuous and defiant.  Sometimes I think that’s what people really fear most.  That all these people just won’t be vaccinated and get away with it.  Maybe that’s why insistence on mass vaccination grows ever more strident.  We’re afraid of what will happen if so many millions defy the peer pressure.  Great job guys.

Funny, but when whatshisface was in office, it was clear that he tacitly wrote off communities like this one based on political, racial and socioeconomic factors.  However, the Democratic Party -- of which I'm a member -- often seems more interested in burnishing their cultural sensitivity creds regarding vaccine hesitancy in communities of color than in dealing with the situation on the ground. Honesty is key.

The law prohibits me from asking about a client's vaccination status.  But I find an opening to share that the vaccine is safe and effective.  I remind mom and dad that the life they save may not be their own.  My family and I got our vaccines in town, and I tell them where.  I don't pry or lecture. Neither the virus nor the vaccine makes any distinctions based on life experience or race, a misconceived argument that, for differing reasons, seems nonetheless to appeal to whichever party is in power.   

Love Joe Biden, but he's kinda ignoring reality if he thinks we're done with covid."
2021-07-03 2:29,"The vaccines work and are widely available, the other people who are not vaccinated yet (not talking about the children here) have made up their mind to not take the best preventive measure (AKA vaccines), so we should respect their decision and move on with our lives, they can get the virus and take care of themselves. they've had every chance of taking the vaccine by now."
2021-07-03 2:32,"While most unvaccinated people will not suffer serious illness from Covid and may chuckle and say it was no big deal (for them), the same will not be true for those others to whom they have passed the virus and who suffered serious harm and/or died.  Many Americans act like we are out of the woods – but the number of cases is increasing again.  Watch the news on Al Jazeera, France 24, or the CBC and learn from the experiences of other nations that have thought the virus had run its course and reduced Covid-related restrictions too soon –only to see another resurgence.  Why is it that 600,000+ deaths in the U.S. and millions more across the planet isn’t sufficient evidence of the danger we face and to cause us to accept the danger and act responsibly for the benefit of all?"

2021-07-03 4:05,"No. In the same way different measures are required to contain spread in regions with higher/lower population density, different vaccination rates are necessary to protect people living in cities or  rural areas. 70% vaccinated across the board was never gonna happen,  but the proof is in the pudding: cases and deaths lowest they've been since March 2020"
2021-07-03 4:18,"Today the Times reports 20,000 new cases, an increase of 17% over two weeks ago. We bottomed out at 11,000 new cases ten days ago, and that number has been going up ever since. 

The delta variant is twice as infectious as the original virus, and the vaccines are slightly less effective against it. RNA viruses mutate fast, and all it takes is a few people with a vaccine-resistant strain to put us back where we started. 

I’m still wearing my mask indoors. I’m vaccinated, but could still get infected (though not necessarily sick), and pass the virus on. I don’t want to do that.

The wisest course right now is caution, not a victory lap. But a large number of people aren’t interested in caution and never were. This situation can still get out of control again, and that scares me. And btw, I have two graduate degrees in virology."

Yes, COVID will continue to spread. This is particularly in areas where vaccination rates are low. But 1) cases are less important than deaths/hospitalizations, and both those metrics are down dramatically, and 2) virtually anybody age 12+ can take a miracle vaccine that is incredibly effective at preventing COVID (and even more effective at preventing severe cases of it).

The midterms will be here in 16 months (likely having been decided 2-3 months earlier), and a president has got to tot-up his victories as they arrive, or as he asserts that they've arrived.

The bottom line is that the country is once again open for business, Joe Biden is the president, and, therefore, it is he who is entitled to claim credit for the goodness of that fact.

It's farcical and so self-serving. We live in delusional times due to a decline in common values and collective will, and common sense and decency. Those of us stationed in South Korea have been in various stages of lockdown continuously since late February 2020. Our priority is to support the mission and to follow the lead of our host nation, which has done a superb job of containing the pandemic. But then serving the collective will is culturally ingrained here. We used to possess it as Americans as a matter of civic duty but not nearly enough anymore. It is not even mandatory for our men and women in uniform to be vaccinated, though most have been at the encouragement of their units or of their own volition.

I will never forgive TFG for the great injustice he did in not serving and protecting the people of the United States.

President Biden has made a valiant effort; many GOP politicians such as Mike DeWine (Gov of Ohio)got shots in arms by creative programs such a 'Vaxamillion', community groups went out and had 'pop up shops', corporations and universities have required their employees and students be vaccinated to attend—not an infringement of individual rights but because  when you are in a life boat and you're trying to get everybody to survive, there are rules to abide by.

2021-07-06 18:02,"“Our product is safe” - says the maker and marketer of the product. 

The TINY number of participants in this “study” is noteworthy, and a strong signal that this is simple PR spin from a company trying to control the narrative in the face of growing concern about J&J ‘jab-ees (myself included), who are factually not as well protected from Delta. 

I for one, regret not getting an mRNA vaccine, and hopeful I can get a booster of Pfizer or Moderna in the coming days. 

At the end of the day, not all vaccines are equal. 

And protection from infection still matters (i.e., avoiding Long Covid, and the endless variants that spin out of areas with high prevalence).  

The silence from the CDC is deafening."
2021-07-06 19:39,"This ""story"" is based on information released directly by J&J that antibodies were identifiable in the blood of 8 participants. This is hardly newsworthy--more company PR than science. Eight participants is too small to be generalizable. This purported study also provided no information regarding the efficacy of protection against the more contagious Delta variant. The biggest concern here is the overall lower efficacy of J&J and the stubborn lack of transparency by public health officials and the media in acknowledging such. Vaccine makers defined COVID differently in trials: Pfizer and Moderna collected data on all infections, including mild infections. J&J only considered moderate or worse illness, which was plenty sick (66% effective moderate to severe, 85% against severe to critical illness). Insisting that ""we cannot compare vaccines, trials were conducted at different times, etc."" along with concerted emphasis on ""J&J prevents most serious outcomes"" ignores more recent evidence of high rates of disability/long-term impacts from even a mild case (15-30+%). mRNA vaccines continue to demonstrate higher efficacy in real world conditions against all symptomatic illness. When will those of us who reluctantly accepted J&J because it was the first available be given equal opportunity to protect ourselves against potentially devastating health impacts?"

2021-07-06 22:57,"‘ “Seventy-two percent is of course lower than 95 or 94 percent,” said Florian Krammer, an immunologist at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York.’

As a scientist and retired medical researcher, I’d like to know what data Dr Krammer is basing this judgment on. Because the data I’ve reviewed that matches the numbers he is quoting come from phase III clinical trials for each of these vaccines. Each trial had different design, different endpoints, was conducted during different phases of the pandemic, enrolled different demographics, and in different countries wheee different viral strains were dominant. In other words, the raw numbers (which are not single numbers anyway, but statistical approximations of probability ranges) are completely and entirely not comparable.

I really wish New York Times writers had sufficient understanding of the stuff of science to push back on such ludicrous statements.

Some vaccines may work better than others. But we simply don’t have enough data to conclude which ones and in which ways yet. We are still learning and statements like the one quoted do a tremendous disservice to truth and to the billions of people in the world who could benefit from a vaccine that is safe, effective, is easily stored, and requires a single dose.

Let’s stick with science and avoid the creation of brand-specific vaccine hesitancy."

I remain concerned about the lack of information about Delta and how much protection the J&J shot actually provides. 

The metric seems to be prevention of hospitalization and death for all vaccines, but I wonder if the long-term effects of mild to moderate illness are also going to be worse with Delta. I have certain pre-existing conditions that could potentially worsen with infection regardless of severity so I would prefer the most protection possible."
2021-07-07 3:18,"Cheer up, Ms Young. I waited for J&J because I have shell fish allergies and felt a one shot deal would be preferable especially if there were a reaction. Happily there was no noticeable reaction aside from the usual soreness in the area of the shot. The follow up news from J&J seems good as well."
2021-07-07 3:27,"As a mother to two young children, I jumped at the opportunity to receive a vaccine as soon as it was offered. In my case it was the J&J shot.
Hearing numbers, however incomparable or misleading, that suggest J&J is only moderately effective at preventing moderate to severe illness, when the mRNA vaccines are 80-90% effective at preventing any symptomatic infection, makes a person wonder about all the assurances that one dose of J&J is a good choice.
Now I have apparently cut off an avenue to even more protection, but the medical establishment (or at least J&J) seems intent on pointing out that since I'm much less likely to be hospitalized, all other considerations should be left aside and I should just be grateful.
I mean.. I am grateful for a vaccine of any kind. But I think I deserve more information (and choice) with regard to what receiving J&J really means."

We’ve had results from the 1-dose trial used for their EUA for over 4 months. Shouldn’t we have at least preliminary data from the large parallel 2-dose trial by now? 

As a participant of the original Ensemble study this is the statistically robust data I’m (anxiously) waiting to see to inform a decision on getting a booster. I’m holding off for now, but when flu season starts in the fall I plan to get a booster one way or another in the absence of better data. 

From JnJ’s 11/15/20 press release:
“In addition to the single-dose regimen ENSEMBLE study, Janssen has now initiated the two-dose regimen ENSEMBLE 2 trial. ENSEMBLE 2 is a complementary, planned, pivotal, large-scale, multi-country Phase 3 trial that will study the safety and efficacy of a two-dose regimen of the investigational Janssen vaccine candidate for the prevention of COVID-19 in up to 30,000 participants worldwide.

Thinking empirically would obviously lead one to seriously consider what the experts think, that is, science.

""Based on past investigations, many of the needles were found are likely from diabetics flushing their used needles down the toilet.""

Never have I heard of such a stupid thing.

2021-07-09 9:41,"This is going to be the long-term toll and healthcare disaster that Covid brings. Everyone is so focused on how many people die and yet this flies under the radar. Stories like this are important and hopefully convincing younger people that they are not invincible from this virus and really need to get vaccinated to avoid outcomes like this.  Covid is not the flu, in the long term it may prove to be more like polio with lifelong disability.  The second it was turned into a political wedge issue by the last administration it virtually guaranteed that this virus was going to be with us for a very long time and cars long-term devastation to peoples’ lives.  It’s too bad it’s not prosecutable."
2021-07-11 9:57,"Doctors treating long haul Covid 19 patients need to consider the possibility that at least some of their patients may be progressing toward or already have ME/CFS. The full name of this debilitating and devastating disease is Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome. Most patients prefer just ME.  Exercise is contraindicated for people with ME because it results in Post-Exertional Malaise or PEM which one of the patients mentioned seems to have.  Pushing yourself to exercise or as we say ""overdoing"" is followed essentially by a collapse of fatigue and many other symptoms for an extended time. The more often this push/collapse cycle occurs, the worse patients get. Those of us who got sick decades ago didn't know this but doctors should know this now. There is a window of perhaps 3 to 5 or 6 years in which recovery from ME/CFS is possible, though rare. But it requires Aggressive Rest Therapy (ART) which essentially means resting ad nauseum, then resting some more. It scares me to hear that patients at risk of or with ME/CFS are being encouraged to exercise. Just at the time when NICE in the UK is about to declare Graded Exercise Therapy harmful for ME/CFS patients, it is sad to hear that Long Haul Clinics are doing the exact wrong thing for those who may have ME/CFS."

Unfortunately lots of people not getting vaccinated - the numbers will increase in the fall and next winter."
2021-07-11 14:47,"Good article. I was a long-hauler for a year, and what fixed it for me was getting vaccinated (J&J). I was able to start running again without the fatigue and didn't experience any more problems with the headaches, etc.  I didn't see if she was fully vaccinated or not in the article, but if not, I highly recommend it.

I recommend that everyone get vaccinated, you definitely do NOT want to get the coronavirus."
2021-07-11 15:20,"In adults, POTS rarely improves with exercise and lifestyle measures alone. Medication is usually necessary. And, as another commenter pointed out, exercise isn’t always appropriate for everyone, as it can lead to severe PEM and deconditioning. (Deconditioning doesn’t cause POTS, ME/CFS, or Long Covid.) 

While I appreciate the efforts of many of these long covid centers, many have been formed at institutions and by people without expertise in autonomic medicine (Northwestern included). I hope everyone with this devastating condition gets the care and treatment they need."

It’s a really big risk that knowing what I know now, I would never take. I had brain fog and fatigue and heart rate irregularities and pushed myself to go on a very mild 2 mile hike last October.

2021-07-12 14:21,"This is heartbreaking to read, on a number of levels. First, it's awful to think how many people, including many young people, are becoming disabled from this virus.

Second, it's distressing to see that the long-Covid clinics are not using the expertise of POTS and ME/CFS specialists, who would inform them that encouraging exercise in these patients is very dangerous and will almost certainly lead a subset of them into lifelong disability. I have a friend whose post-Covid symptoms have been growing steadily worse under the care of one such clinic (in NYC), and who has recently been forced to take full disability leave. 

Third, it hurts to read about the huge medical teams assembled for the care of these new post-viral-syndrome patients, when thousands of us who have suffered for years and even decades from related syndromes can rarely find a single specialist to manage our care. Of course, if these teams are ignorant of the syndrome they are dealing with, these resources are worse than wasted."
2021-07-12 15:57,"Is this post viral syndrome?
Is it not  true that some  viral or bacterial  illnesses cause long term dysfunction. For example many  Polio  survivors  get  post Polio syndrome which may kill or cripple them  even 30 years  after initial infection!
Thousands of people especially women  suffer from most of the same symptoms as Long Covid and are  without a diagnosis.  They have an exhausting  journey going from  specialist to specialist  for help. They have to direct  their  own health care journey with no support. 
If only these types of centers being established for Long Covid patients were available to the thousands of undiagnosed exhausted people seeking help with no place to go."

2021-07-13 0:21,"As long as the drug companies that want to make boosters will accept the economic consequences if they're not recommended (and not ever widely used), I don't see the harm. 

Given what Delta is doing, and what Lamda and Delta plus exist, and no telling what else is coming or already circulating at low levels, I'd rather be safer and sorry. 

But at the end of the day, the authorities like the CDC and guidance from peoples' doctors should determine if the booster shots end up being given to various groups, or not. 

And if drug companies want to aggressively spend money on that before it is recommended and THEN congress bails them out (i.e. pays them a lot anyway) if it isn't needed -- that's when as a taxpayer, I get very angry and start changing voting decisions."
2021-07-13 1:16,"The CDC and FDA has had a lot of false starts, errors, and corrections during this pandemic and are saying we don't need a booster now.

When we do need one, there won't be any available so why not prepare one now?"
2021-07-13 1:30,"Manufacturer allotments and production should not be misdirected to booster shots as long as a significant portion of the world's population is not receiving sufficient stock for their first vaccines. 75% to go in receiving their first shot.

In light of that, in particular, no sidetracking for booster shots in the USA where barely half the population (55% with a single dose and only 200 daily shots per 100k - Canada is at 1250 daily shots per 100k) appears interested in being vaccinated.  The community public health priority must be upon vaccinating those who are not inoculated.  That will not only add protection to the unvaccinated but also to those who have already received their vaccines. A booster shot to a few will not end this phase of the pandemic.

Community outbreaks must be mitigated. Since the USA has prematurely rushed to re-open and shunned mask use, all that is left for you is to dramatically increase your inexcusably low rates of vaccinations. As of tomorrow, with Canada hitting 70% of the population with a single vaccination, the USA's current vaccination rate put you 6 months behind at attaining that 70%. That is a gross failure in public health and your fight against this pandemic.

As long as outbreaks continue, all populations remain at risk from current and future variants.

Vaccines for those without vaccines before sidetracking to the greed and pandemic fighting waste of booster shots to the privileged."
2021-07-13 1:31,"My husband and I are both fully vaccinated (Pfizer). Last week, while we were on vacation Provincetown, my husband tested positive for Covid, among dozens of other breakthrough cases there. My husband’s case was not mild; it felt like a severe flu with all the trademark symptoms of Covid, including loss of taste and smell. I’m confident that without the vaccine, his case would have been more server, which is both terrifying and reassuring. I agree that the vaccines are working well, but not well enough against these variants. We need boosters and we need them now."
2021-07-13 1:44,"I'd really like to see a version of this discussion focused on the (one dose) J&J vaccine.  I know that the company tested their vaccine as one dose, and got good enough results for emergency approval, like their two shot competitors. What I still don't fundamentally understand is why it's more effective in a single dose than the similar Oxford/GSK one is (which provides only limited protection from a single shot)."
2021-07-13 1:48,"More and more friends and friends/family of friends, etc are reporting ""breakthrough"" Covid cases, in spite of being fully vaccinated.  And these are not a-symptomatic cases - one friend ran a fever of 101 for 3 days, could barely move, and struggled to breathe.  How are these breakthrough cases being tracked and interpreted?  Do they indicate a need for boosters?  Is the NYT and other media investigating or reporting on this phenomena?  Is the public being clearly informed of risks?  Or will the pressure to declare the virus vanquished and fully re-open prevail, no matter the cost?"
2021-07-13 1:49,"We should pay for doses in low vaccination areas before we Americans get third doses.  We are probably paying more per dose than other countries, otherwise, why would Pfizer try for a third dose here so soon.  I was fully vaccinated only 5 months ago, and I would rather other countries get vaccinated.

Pfizer should cut  us a deal on price for poorer countries like Honduras."
2021-07-13 1:52,"The immunocompromised need a third shot.  The rest of us can wait.  And yes -- we need to vaccinate the rest of the country and world. However, without the masking indoors mandate, those with  little to no antibodies post-vaccine are in a more precarious position than before, as they are not protected by others' masking.  Back to wearing our kn-95 masks indoors-- and worrying that a passerby could be infecting us with Covid-19."
2021-07-13 1:53,"Just the other day in this paper, I read about the incredible difficulty in convincing many people in the US to agree to be vaccinated and how this is hindering herd immunity. 

The other week, I read about how some doctors  vaccinated by J&J chose to get mRNA boosters on their own. 

I consistently hear about long Covid and how, even with a mild case, you could be suffering with this disease for a year or more, so bad that you'll be on disability and unable to work. 

And now, I am reading that we don't need boosters because the goal of the vaccine is for us not to land in the hospital, and we should be concentrating on the unvaccinated all over the world, especially so new variants don't emerge.

Everyday it is something new and it is overwhelming to the general population. Should I be worried that I got J&J and its not as effective as the mRNA vaccines? Should I be concerned that I live with a child too young to be vaccinated and an immunocompromised spouse? What about the fact that my employer is not requiring vaccines and though masks are required for those not vaccinated, there is no way of policing this?

One thing that we could do as a country that would be a step in the right direction would be to make the vaccine mandatory. Take away emergency authorization and make everyone get it. Then boosters will be less necessary since herd immunity will be closer, and vaccines can be shipped elsewhere."
2021-07-13 1:53,"For Pete’s sake, we don’t need boosters. The two doses of the vaccine are extremely effective. Yes, there are breakthrough cases, but these are mild colds. Even with our less-than-ideal overall adult vaccination rates in the US, the elderly have mostly chosen to vaccinate and deaths have consequently plummeted. In this context, case counts are no longer relevant; it’s deaths and hospitalizations that we should be mindful of.

For the love of Pete, get the vaccines to adults overseas who are still crying out for them. Our embarrassment of riches is truly an embarrassment."
2021-07-13 1:55,"I'm leaning on the side of Pfizer here as they are seeing the real-world data first. As I am in an elevated risk category, I will certainly be one of the first in line for a booster jab (if) when it is made available to me."
2021-07-13 2:04,"""The New Epsilon variant has three mutations on it’s spike protein that result in a dampening of the effectiveness of antibodies from current vaccines or from prior COVID infection. This reduction of potency is on the order of 2 to 3.5 times. That’s concerning, because it could mean a sharply reduced effectiveness of vaccination against this particular variant."" Daily Kos 7/12/21

New variants of concern are occurring all the time so boosters should be on the horizon."
2021-07-13 2:04,"The most burning question relates to those with J & J vaccination. We need to pull apart the mRNA vaccinations from J & J which has many problems. 

For those with J & J a booster is a 2nd shot not 3rd. I would urge research to hone in on this gap in protection ( for those with  J & J  vaccination) & then move on to mRNA booster question."
2021-07-13 2:05,Doesn’t Pfizer stand to make huge amounts of dollars from selling booster shots?  Do you think these profits might lead them to interpret data in the manner they are doing?  Don’t believe anything Big Pharma tells you…
2021-07-13 2:06,"I remember reading in February 2020 of an epidemiologist predicting that Covid-19 would become like the flu — a persistent but mild threat, as long as people got their annual (or however often) shot. 

Once you’ve framed it that way, it all feels very expected and reasonable."
2021-07-13 2:17,"I don't feel like waiting for the FDA to get evidence in the form of extremely sick or dead vaccinated people before I get a third shot as a booster. My second shot was 6 months ago, and my age and other risk factors make me want to play it as safe as possible, not to mention the fact that roughly half the population is running around unvaccinated in a state of ignorant denial, spreading the Delta variant and making it more likely that even worse variants will arise before the FDA figures out what to do. It seems to me like much of the country is living in Fantasyland thinking that this pandemic is somehow over."
2021-07-13 2:34,"The position of the CDC the medical establishment of ""leading experts"" is based on their assessment that the 30% of the population that is unvaccinated comes first and that doing what Israel is doing: giving it to the immunocompromised will complicate things for them. As of now they are correct that fully vaccinated people who are not immunocompromised have no reason to worry now. However there are 10-15 million Americans who are immunocompromised. We need boosters  if our antibody levels are low. Is this country unable to care for us and seek out the unvaccinated too? Full transparency: I am a doctor and am immunocompromised."
2021-07-13 2:35,The mRNA vaccines as very effective. I am not sure the J and J vaccine is that effective. Today for the first time I saw a patient with severe covid disease after receiving J and J vaccine in May. He was young and had no risk factors. I also a patient with mild disease after J and J vaccine. I assume both have been infected with one of the new variants.
2021-07-13 2:42,"If it's free, I'll take it.  The government does not want to pay unless absolutely required, and Pfizer will not want to want to ""discount"" it any more.

Go figure."
2021-07-13 2:45,"J&J'er here (when the early picture on it, plus avails all the way 'round were still very regimented) and I'd be very grateful for a booster -- or full course -- of the mRNA. 

Not to be greedy. I fully realize am fortunate to have anything at all. And will continue to take extra precautions. 

However, with all the J&J issues, and reading the SridharC, dr/nurse/other med pro (?) in NY post -- about starting to see J&J patients with significant breakthrough illness -- 
yeah, I'd be up for a Pfizer right about now."
2021-07-13 2:49,"The entire pandemic has been a combination of balancing emerging scientific data and important social considerations.  Ideally, we would all know our own antibody and cell-mediated immunity levels to determine if additional vaccine dosing is even required.  This is not practical.  

For now, vaccinating the unvaccinated will help everyone.  Consider the third dose for the immunocompromised to make them ""vaccinated.""  The rest of us can wait."
2021-07-13 2:58,I got a third Pfizer after reading about booster shots.  I figured it couldn’t hurt and might provide a boost.
2021-07-13 2:59,"CDC recommendations are highly political. There is an 
admittedly small population where booster shots would 
be needed -- the two shot vaccination did not produce 
antibodies, but the third shot is likely to do that."
2021-07-13 3:20,"I can’t help feeling a certain level of suspicion that messages come with ulterior motives. We saw that with masks last year and again with activities recommended as safe for vaccinated subjects this year. Frequent conflicts between players have been a feature of the coronavirus game. But I agree the many Americans who haven’t gotten their shots yet are at least part of the reason we are seeing a hike in cases now. The 59% adult vaccination uptake, though encouraging, isn’t good enough for this highly aggressive virus. We really need everyone on board here."
2021-07-13 3:28,"For most people that think a booster shot will help them, they are not thinking about the percent chance that it will, but they want the shot to be on the safe side.  Pity the world doesn't think the same way about putting more CO2/CH4 into the atmosphere.  For example in the U.S. what difference does it make if a switch to renewable energy is done through unions and the biggest power monopolies, or done through contractors and homeowners putting solar on their roof.  It will take both.

Just like fighting off this pandemic, it should be done in the cheapest way that it can be done quickly and most efficiently, which would be every means at our disposal--through regulation, homeowners, R&D, utilities, a carbon tax, Chinese manufacturers--anything to get the job done as quickly as possible.

What we have now is a fossil fuel industry that is stalling any action at all--nothing to less than nothing being done while we barrel towards the ice caps melting and 60' sea level rise, and with a tipping point when it will be too late to do anything .

And once solar is installed, the energy is free.  The Democrats may now have the only opportunity we're going to get to do something dramatic about climate change through budget reconciliation that will really make a difference.  Why don't they just do it?"
2021-07-13 3:28,"What we really need is an effective PR campaign to get the people in the COVID hotspots vaccinated. Nick Saban recorded an ad telling Alabamians that we want a packed stadium this fall, and that we have to raise the vaccination rate for that to happen. Since Saban is the only living soul (besides perhaps James Spann) who could defeat Trump in Alabama, this is going to be an effective campaign. States really need to figure out how to reach their unvaccinated population. In Alabama, it’s as simple as college football. I feel like a vaccine lottery would also be effective across red states, and I don’t really understand why more haven’t done this."
2021-07-13 3:34,"Honestly, who are these public health experts who are saying this?  If you read their statements it seems that they are actually saying we will need them but they would rather prioritize the unvaccinated.  The CDC has politicized their messaging to point of losing my trust.  Next month they’ll be telling us that we need to get a booster for Delta or some other variant.  What a mess."
2021-07-13 3:40,"I am a kidney transplant patient, and I have had two doses of Pfizer.  I also have a complete absence of antibodies. Many of the  immune-compromised, some 11,000,000 Americans, need three doses. Some of us will need four. Johns Hopkins has done the research that revealed that almost half of us. didn't get antibodies after the second shot-- and also that a third or fourth dose could help the situation. France and Israel have acted on that research, while our country continues to tell us to isolate ourselves. The current attitude is both ironic and maddening. Meanwhile, doctors like Dr. Del Rio should remember us when he makes blanket statements that no one needs a booster. One problem for America is that if people like me get  COVID, we are more likely to end up as long haulers. who unfortunately incubate new variants. It is probably even more important for the health of the country to give us more doses than it is to give them to unvaccinated Americans refusing the shots."
2021-07-13 4:23,The fact that many around the world are in need of the vaccine does not eliminate the scientific fact that the vaccinated may soon need a booster.
2021-07-13 4:27,"It feels like the American government and health authorities and media outlets have forgotten that children under 12 cannot be vaccinated against covid-19. As a mom of a young child, the filter I am reading through is that of protecting my unvaccinated-able child. Would appreciate more attention to how the variants, policies and public health can help me keep my toddler safe. Also, we need earlier American reporting / news from around the globe on how the variants are impacting other cultures’ communities as the variants will inevitably make it here; we can learn much from others’ experiences. I started reading online newspapers from India to learn about Delta. Would be great to have a more centralized professional effort with a filter."
2021-07-13 4:38,"It is worth remembering that a few months ago, the CDC announced that it has stopped collecting data about Covid infections that do not lead to hospitalizations. This makes it essentially impossible to track cases among the fully vaccinated who got a mild infection but still suffer the terrible long-term effects of  ""long Covid"". So for the CDC to now say that they have no data that would justify booster shots is rather disingenuous. The surest way for not finding an effect is not to look...."
2021-07-13 4:56,"Although someone who has certain immune system problems may have had two injections of the e.g. Pfizer vaccine, is it really accurate to use the language ""fully vaccinated""?  Clinical research has already been published showing that methotrexate, a widely used immunosuppressant drug, reduces antibody generation.  Although the authors of that study suggested that temporary suspension of the methotrexate should eliminate the problem, there was no guidance to that effect when many people were getting vaccinated.  If one or both of their doses was consequently likely to have been only partially effective, it seems reasonable to allow them a third dose."
2021-07-13 4:57,"Given the snail’s pace of federal bureaucrats, it is not too soon for the vaccine makers to lay the groundwork for a booster shot down the road—or, indeed, a second round of vaccinations using a readjusted vaccine aimed at the new variants. Status quo is fine for now, but we must prepare for the future."
2021-07-13 5:09,"Everyone has to start dealing with the fact that a lot of people in the US aren't going to get vaccinated. Wagging fingers at them, calling them names, accusing them of negligence toward their neighbors, etc. is not going to help.
  So, considering that, boosters for those most at risk are certainly reasonable. The ""experts"" are wrong.
  Perhaps its time to get back to a more normal routine; a prescription from your doctor and approval from your insurer..."
2021-07-13 5:10,"It occurs to me now that the recent news concerning Pfizer applying for approval of a covid-19 booster shot and the FDA and CDC declaring that at this time they don't think a booster is necessary has a subtext, that being that these federal agencies do not want to contribute to the doubts of the unvaccinated. Vaccination rates are crucial in controlling the pandemic in the USA. If a booster is approved (e.g. in Israel, it's been approved for people with compromised immune systems, etc.) what will an unvaccinated American be thinking: ""Dang, I have to get 3 shots now???"" They don't want that, so they are saying 2 shots is adequate to protect you even from Delta variants.

The minute I can get a booster, I will!"
2021-07-13 5:21,"What is to stop someone who wants a third, or maybe a fourth, shot from just going and getting one? It is my impression many, if not most, of the pharmacies in NYC giving shots have not been submitting data to state database, because people applying for those Excelsior passes have not been able to get them for that specific reason (and have had to return to pharmacy to get it straightened out). So you just go to a different vaccine site.

Furthermore, even if you ARE in your state's database, we have no national database, so it should be easy to just go to another state for another shot or two, no? Just don't give them any insurance info you used for initial shots. Say you don't have any insurance."
2021-07-13 6:32,"Am I the only one who feels both grateful for the vaccine and concurrently weary of big Pharma and their inevitable push for vaccine, vaccine, and more vaccine?

I got both doses despite trepidation that these medicines have not been fully vetted and time tested, because I felt that the risk of Covid was bigger than any risks from the vaccine.  However, I'm really disturbed by the trend of shutting down any discussions that raise questions about it's safety.  You can't tell me that doctors and scientists have not been wrong with regards to meds deemed safe.

Ads for Zantac were all over T.V. for years and taken like candy before being recalled. Xanax has its own dangers we're now aware of.  A drug for osteoporosis was recalled after finding that it caused brittle bones that shatter, on and on... All of this is to say, I can't help but see the push for boosters with a certain degree of skepticism."
2021-07-13 6:34,"We have maybe a third or more of the adults between 49-60 in our country running around without masks, unvaccinated, and they aren’t getting injections.  

Then we have immune compromised individuals who don’t know if the vaccine is working for them, who are trying to stay alive despite the cavalier attitudes of others.  

And we have a recommendation from the CDC that’s telling us, despite an increasingly identifiable number of breakthrough infections, that no one needs a booster at this time.

So, who do we believe? The CDC?  Or the policies of countries with first world healthcare systems like France and Israel?"
2021-07-13 6:36,"It is quite obvious that the stark disrecommendation of a booster shot is not because the science does not support one, but because of vaccine shortage - inside and outside the US.

It would be far better communication and improve trust if the powers in charge would say so in plain English as opposed to putting up a smokescreen of pseudo-arguments."
2021-07-13 6:39,I had covid and am a long hauler. I had extreme allergic reactions to the Pfizer vaccine. I’m terrified to get another one. Sitting in the cvs with the nurses getting panicky my body was saying didn’t we already do this?! They’d really need to convince me.
2021-07-13 6:54,Can we be checked for antibodies to see if a booster is necessary? I was tested as an adult and ended up needing an MMR because I did not have sufficient antibodies.
2021-07-13 7:06,This crisis has so much to teach us. Thinking in terms of countries competing for doses is typical but insane. We have to get all of humanity to realise that we are most literally all in the same boat. Viruses don’t stand in line to have their passports stamped.
2021-07-13 7:06,"""Mild"" cases of covid lead to long term health consequences -- so-called long covid -- quite often, with estimates ranging between 10 and 30% of cases. The public health establishment is making a grave mistake if it judges the need for booster shots solely on the basis of hospitalization and death rates. If failure to boost against delta and other virulent variants leads to a long covid epidemic, the Biden Administration will be punished for that in the midterms. All the goodwill garnered from the Spring vaccine roll-out will evaporate."
2021-07-13 7:12,"I did everything I was supposed to do regarding this pandemic and really didn't do anything in public until two weeks after my second dose of Moderna. I still wear a mask in public indoor settings. I am young and completely healthy, but not only did I want to avoid getting sick and infecting my family, I didn't want to infect anyone else. Obviously we need to see if the science warrants a booster of the same shot or a totally new vaccine, but both Israel and France are providing boosters for high-risk patients. But I don't want to be in a situation where I or a member of my family ends up infected, while the CDC is once again navel gazing or trying to figure out how to play this situation with boosters so that antivaxxers don't become more resistant. They are scientists and they should stick to the science. CDC stating that mask mandates could end did not convince the antivaxxers to change their minds. All it did was drive up transmission. The country would have had much lower Covid infection numbers now if states had kept mask mandates in place. Exactly two weeks after the mask mandate ended in MI, we are seeing our numbers go up, even though we have a pretty good vaccination rate."
2021-07-13 7:13,"Could it really be that Pfizer and the other drug manufacturers are redirecting their resources to producing a booster when most of the people of the world are suffering and dying from this pandemic for lack of access to even the first jab?  

And for those without the most basic compassion for others, consider this: so long as a substantial portion of the world's population is unvaccinated, this planet remains a breeding pit for emerging variants that will continue to threaten us all.

What common sense and decency dictate is that Americans have had sufficient privilege and opportunity to get vaccinated. President Biden should set a deadline of one more month, at which time all unused vaccines in this country should be donated to those countries with the most need."
2021-07-13 7:29,I’m more inclined to go with what Pfizer recommends over the CDC. I know Pfizer is motivated by profits but also heavily regulated so any exaggeration on their end has to be backed by evidence. I have no idea what drives CDC’s decision making— politics and pacifying over evidence as far as I can tell. Never thought I’d say I trust a drug company over the CDC!
2021-07-13 8:19,"The desire to have simple messaging means at-risk people lose easily-provided safety. 

* We've long known the immunocompromized (IC) risk more severe illness 
 * We're able to measure antibodies: even after 2 shots IC's can be low (or zero)
* The medical systems in France and Israel aren't irrational and
* If we worry about stopping new variants, the IC need extra protection.

Add all of that together, and it would seem needlessly cruel to ask the IC in the US to wait. An additional dose merely gets an IC person to where others already are. 

To choose to not test them, to choose to prevent them catching up, is to choose a real continuing risk for them out of fear that this will confuse others. 

It's not confusing to want everyone to get to the minimum acceptable Vaccine Efficacy (VE) level of protection. Instead it's flabbergasting we'd knowingly choose to leave the IC out of this level.

Similarly with J&J. Pfizer's reduced VE with Delta is still higher than the initial VE for J&J. Why ask J&J recipients to stick with their 6x risk of getting Covid (vs Pfizer, pre-Delta: 94% vs 64% VE means 6% vs 36%) when the vast majority of recipients have the mRNA level of VE?

If you don't know anyone with long Covid, perhaps a non-hospitalized case doesn't seem so bad. People have lost their livelihoods, not from the mild case, but from the months of symptoms afterwards. J&J recipients have an increased risk of mild cases. Why leave them there?"
2021-07-13 8:50,"I’m vaccinated and believe full and well that it’s the right choice for everyone who is eligible to do the same. That said, call me cynical, but this effort to promote boosters reads more like Pfizer trying to boost share holder earnings than to act on empirically driven findings. What a shame that greed and capitalism has created such a mess that this even enters my thoughts."
2021-07-13 9:35,"I so much would like to believe the doctors about not needing a booster shot now but because there is a shortage of vaccines in other countries I wonder if they want these booster shots to go to those countries.  I say this because I remember when the virus started in America and the doctors told us we didn't need masks.  The reason for telling us we didn't need masks at the onset of COVID-19 in America was because of the shortage of masks.  The health care workers didn't have enough of masks so any masks that were available were given to those workers first.  It wasn't until there was an abundance of masks that the public was told we needed to wear them.
Even though I have been fully vaccinated I still wear my mask indoor stores, etc.  I sincerely hope that we are being told the truth about a booster shot!"
2021-07-13 10:02,On CNN Dr. Fauci said the CEO of Pfizer telephoned him to apologize for not consulting with the CDC first.  When I was in college for score and twenty years ago I think they called it Demand-Push in marketing.  They might not even use that term anymore.
2021-07-13 10:16,"The CDC/FDA joint response said they would recommend boosters when the, ""science"" demonstrates a need for it.  Under Trump, no one would dare use the word, ""science"" in the announcement.  Actually, Trump would have unleashed the IRS to audit Pfizer for the last twenty years."
2021-07-13 10:58,"Another large question relates to US citizens that have gotten vaccines like sinopharm and sinovac. Both have lower antibody levels, may not have long lasting immunity, and are associated with minimal effectiveness against symptomatic disease according according to WHO. Evidence from Indonesia says that they are not as good against delta variant and may not protect against hospitalization and death. Data is scant because the Chinese may not be forthcoming. The CDC needs to make a recommendation on booster shots for people who have gotten Chinese vaccines. Sooner rather than later!!"
2021-07-13 11:01,"My partner is immunocompromised and at even greater risk because of people who refuse the vaccine.  I've seen the research so far on a third dose for the immunocompromised and it's very promising.  In our family, we are still basically living in ""lockdown"" due to his health.  It's time the CDC thinks about people like us and allows the third vaccine."
2021-07-13 11:04,"In other words, we are waiting for a surge in hospitalizations among the vaccinated."
2021-07-13 11:22,"it s not even half a year since the vast majority of people had been vaccinated, even less for thise with 2 doses.. there must be a problem with vaccines if a booster may be needed so soon, or something suspicious regarding the vaccine companies.. I am a vaccine sceptic and this certainly doesn't change my mind..."
2021-07-13 11:27,"I think that Pfizer is taking the responsible approach in readying booster vaccines.  They don’t seem to be needed just yet, but may be essential in three to six months when new variants arrive, such as the lambda variant, which are more capable of defeating the current vaccine.  I don’t understand the CDC’s reluctance to take this possibility into account.  Without ongoing research and available booster shots, Americans could be facing a return of lockdowns again, and putting us back to square one.  The CDC needs to plan ahead to prevent another disastrous virus wave."
2021-07-13 11:33,I dunno. I dunno. I'm standing by with my sleeve rolled up. It wasn't that long ago the health experts were telling us we didn't need masks because there there weren't enough of them.
2021-07-13 11:36,"I’m fully vaccinated and No Dr.delrio , Pfizer does not decide nor does the CDC and FDA decide.  If we’re being honest here they were partners in this whole mess.   So for a booster No enough.   We are opening up and cases are soaring.   We are celebrating victory while we are still in the middle of the game."
2021-07-13 11:37,"This kind of article,  mainly focus on booster shots, just increased the anxiety of the public. 
As Dr. Jha said: . “Even if you take a very narrow lens that you only care about the lives of Americans, there’s still a very compelling argument that a first shot for an Indian person does more good for America than a third shot for an American.”"
2021-07-13 11:40,"I do believe in the science but not the FDA or CDC.  I think booster shots are needed.  I will never forget government agencies saying ""masks won't help."" Never.  For the 50%+ who believe in the vaccine, a booster is desired. I'll take the shot MO residents don't want."
2021-07-13 11:51,"Line me up fo a booster. 

It is not that I don’t trust science. It is just a public health officials a different remit than I do. 

Avoiding hospitalization and death it’s just my starting point. I don’t even want mild or asymptomatic Covid at all. Those numbers ranging from 64 to 88% effectiveness just suddenly don’t sound that great. 

I agree, it is super important  to vaccinate everyone. We need to surges, stress on the hospital system, and reduce the likelihood of additional variance. In the meantime, if those shots are sitting there because millions of people decide not to get one,I’m happy to get it."
2021-07-13 11:51,"How are booster shots counterproductive to vaccinating the world? Most of the world cannot administer the mRNA vaccines. 

Also, the US has a special problem with the 20% of population refusing vaccines. We need booster shots to protect ourselves from these people."
2021-07-13 12:07,"We have seen a lot of actions by drug companies in the last few decades that show a significantly larger concern for their profits over the health of people in this country.  Two rather stark examples come to mind, Purdue and Insulin.  Therefore, I am rather skeptical about this drive from Pfizer concerning booster shots.  

Added to that is the simple fact that vaccine refusal/unavailability is by far a larger concern for public health because of the simple math about the creation of variants.  The higher percentage of people in our global population who are unvaccinated or who are are refusing to get vaccinated creates a much higher risk that eventually variants will develop that can get around the current vaccine.  That is simple probability math (a difficult concept for many people as evidenced by the number that seriously play the lottery).

As for the C.D.C. and the W.H.O. playing politics, well, they are made up of humans, and some level of politics will be there, but look at their record.  The C.D.C. was created in 1946 and the W.H.O. In 1948.  Has life expectancy increased since then? Yep!  Did they play a role in that? Yep again!  The ability of medicine to help people has skyrocketed in those 72 years.  When they have missed the mark, it is usually due to outside political influence by people who should know better.  Given their record on getting things right vs someone like Tucker Carlson, I’ll pict the former, any day."
2021-07-13 12:08,Would a booster be the same shot as the ones we already have or would it be comprised of something different?
2021-07-13 12:15,"Since the CDC in its ""wisdom"" has decided since the end of May to only follow breakthrough cases that lead to hospitalization or death how will they know  the true number of breakthrough cases?  It is known that mild and moderate cases can lead to ""long covid.""  Do the vaccines prevent long covid in breakthrough cases?  We need to know that.  Shouldn't the CDC want to know as well?"
2021-07-13 12:18,"There are parts of the World where people are not even willing to get the (much less controversial) Polio inoculation. The reason that people are slow in getting vaccinated has little to do with the amount of doses being produced. That's only one part of a long, complicated, supply chain. The most serious bottlenecks have to do with the transport, storage, distribution, and administration of the Covid vaccine. Let's not discount the fact that vaccine reluctance is a global phenomenon--although differing national populations have their different reasons-- and that in some countries, the majority of the population is opting out.
For Americans who do desire to get the protection of the 3rd Dose ""Booster Shot"", there are fewer hurdles and less severe bottlenecks constraining access to shots. As of now, it looks like the bureaucracies of the CDC, FDA, and WHO are the major stymie. The reality is that Covid is probably already endemic, which means that sooner or later there will be a need for a 3rd shot, a 4th Shot, a 5th Shot....
I can't help but think about the initial CDC guidelines which suggested that the public need not wear masks, that it was only essential for frontline Medical workers to do so. It was indeed the Government's obligation to ensure that all Frontline Medical workers had adequate protection, but it was sheer folly to try to dissuade the public that it was still necessary to take whatever measures they could to protect themselves against airborne viral particle"
2021-07-13 12:22,"Whatever the thoughts on booster shots, remember.
The vaccines do not guarantee you will not catch the virus.
My wife has had 2 shots, she contacted the delta variant 4 weeks after receiving her second shot.
I had both shots a little earlier as I am older, but have not caught the virus. 
What the vaccine has done in her case is keep her out of hospital, nine days on now since contracting it (she caught it from a grandchild) she is recovering from what has been a short but debilitating illness.
We do not know yet what the long term effects may be of course.
We continue to isolate, but should be free to get on with our lives in a few days.
Keep wearing those masks people."
2021-07-13 12:30,Shouldn't the focus be on reformulation of the vaccine to specifically target Delta and variants with similar mutations?  That would far better address the current threat.
2021-07-13 12:31,Staying out of the hospital is such a low bar. I had Covid at the very beginning of all of this and now I have to take a pill every single day for my heart. How serious was the illness? Seriousness enough to go to the hospital? No. But serious enough to affect my health for the rest of my life.￼￼ Why is the bar so low? Surely we can do better than merely avoiding death.
2021-07-13 12:33,"Why can we not get the rest of the world vaccinated and give ourselves booster shots? If rich countries get besieged again, we’ll be in no shape to help anyone."
2021-07-13 12:33,"What I think I'm hearing in the comments from experts is that, while there is little doubt that a booster will have some benefit, it's not as great AT THIS TIME as the benefit of getting equivalent doses into the arms of those in largely unvaccinated populations. If those of us who have been fully vaccinated the best things we can do is to continue to mask (when appropriate) and encourage everyone else to get vaccinated. There will come a time when a booster makes sense, it's almost certainly not now, with the possible exception of those in imuno-compromised situations."
2021-07-13 12:37,"Pfizer is looking to boost its bottom line and reward their shareholders is what I see in their motives. 
Their approach is offense is the best approach is what I read here. 
Using Israeli practice of a tiny nation for our country is  unwarranted."
2021-07-13 12:40,"It seems to me that when the CDC and WHO says we should leave the decision to scientists - they don't believe that. The real reason is the optics of giving additional doses to people in wealthy countries while large parts of the world have very low vaccination rates. 
Once again, they are forgetting the health care workers who treat people in their offices, clinics and hospitals every day."
2021-07-13 12:42,"My concern is that people go out in droves with no masks and no social distancing in restaurants, grocery stores, and other public places.  It seems that they are invincible of any virus attack after two doses of vaccination. I don't think people are aware of the breakthrough cases that could happen to them.

FDC or CDC never disclose the symptoms of breakthrough cases.  NY Times did report that more than than 10,000 cases occurred till April this year. Since then, we learn nothing further from CDC or FDC. People need to know. Since this Delta variant becomes active, we need to learn and protect our self better."
2021-07-13 12:44,"The accompanying pic is revealing. Even in a health care setting, this patient is not wearing her mask correctly and may as well not be wearing a mask at all.

I take immunosuppressants, got double vaccinated with Pfizer, but as per medical advice, still err on the side of acting UNvaccinated.  Israel is strategically giving its people with weakened immune systems a booster shot with good reason: many of us had no-to-low vax response, and studies show a booster amps the antibodies. To our U.S. government:  stop messing around.  Let immunocompromised U.S. citizens/residents have a shot at a Pfizer booster, and with it, a shot at Covid protection and normalcy."
2021-07-13 6:31,"What doctors such as Dr. del Rio fail to realize is that all the cajoling in the world is not going to increase the vaccination rate to reach herd immunity because half of Americans are too uninformed and ignorant about the advantages of vaccination due to extreme right-wing anti-vaxxer propaganda. Vaccinations have essentially plateaued. As a patient with an immunological disorder and one who is very concerned of catching Covid, I have no patience for these people. I will be asking my doctor for a third shot as soon as he can give it to me."

2021-07-13 12:26,"Pfizer and Moderna are real scientists in the real World who in fact invented the vaccine, mass produced it and shipped it to the States for administration without any help whatsoever from the bureaucrats who make up the FDA and the CDC, who by the way has been giving everyone poor advice throughout the pandemic. I would put my trust and faith in Pfizer and Moderna not in the FDA and the CDC. I am 77 years old and immunocompromised because I have rheumatoid arthritis and take methotrexate an immune suppressant medication which has been known to reduce antibody response in vaccines. The FDA does not even recommend that people like me who were not included in the drug trials get the special antibody test to see if my antibody production is adequate. Essentially, they left me and millions of others who are immunocompromised out to dry.

The alternative, COVID, is worse."
2021-07-13 1:21,"Does anyone who follows Covid really trust the CDC with this decision?

From an article in the LATimes about delta.

“Breakthrough infections can occur for a couple of different reasons. If your antibody levels decline over time, you might be susceptible to breakthrough infections. The other type of breakthrough infection scenario is where the virus itself has mutated, so that the immune response you have doesn’t work as well. So those are two different potential scenarios, and both of those are being monitored.”

Really?  Who is monitoring breakthrough infections?  Necessarily in the U.S. it’s not the CDC.

“What’s the takeaway for people worried about being infected with the Delta variant?

Yang: The takeaway is that we can’t rely entirely on the vaccines, because they are probably not going to be as effective in preventing the virus from spreading around. We can’t just jump back to “normal life.” We have to realize this virus is still a threat. And we have to take reasonable precautions to protect ourselves from getting infected even if we’re vaccinated.

Even though the vaccine may make it so that illness is milder and that we may be personally protected, we have to keep in mind that there are many people who aren’t vaccinated who are vulnerable. There are also people in whom the vaccine doesn’t work who are vulnerable.

As a society, we need to be responsible about protecting everybody.”

We’re all in this together?  Then why did the CDC tell us to take off our masks?!"

I consider that a snapshot of the contemporary four i's: inequality, ignorance, idiocy, and insanity. You can stick a needle in someone's arm but what about the four i's and the balance of the world's pressing problems? Indulge no illusions. Safe we are not.

But you can't control epidemics, only stop by testing and quarantine, vaccines weren't needed for SARS and Ebola here. 
Taiwan was  stopping it.  Till they let some foreigners from careless countries slip in unchecked, now they're only 1000+ times better than us.

Pfizer, the CDC, Israel, France, experts like Dr. Carlos Del Rio and Dr. Paul Offit and even the WHO have all identified a key question regarding how to optimally protect already vaccinated individuals from Covid. One thought to consider which could mistakenly put under the antivaxer  rubric. The immune system is not inexhaustible, has regulatory mechanisms and is vulnerable to excessive stimulation. Bottom line is that there may be a sweet spot regarding both vaccine efficacy and safety that could even vary somewhat with age and other cofactors such as immune compromise. Notably, younger patients possibly due to “stronger” immune systems may be more vulnerable to heart inflammation post vaccine. So giving extra doses may not be benign. On the other  hand some immune compromised patients may benefit from an extra dose. It is crucial that we proceed carefully, thoroughly in collecting lots of data and strategically (making decisions with less than optimal data). This usually cynical observer of the health care system is impressed how all parties including Pfizer, the CDC, the FDA, and experts such as Dr. Del Rio and Paul Offit are proceeding. At this point they don’t need to agree! One note if caution is that infectious diseases experts and even vaccine and public health experts are usually not immunologists and often lack the expertise and experience to understand this important issue regarding vaccine immune system interactions for better or worse."

This is ridiculous! The CDC stopped tracking breakthrough infections unless they result in death or hospitalization so their data is severely limited and does not prove efficacy of these vaccines. Astonishingly, the CDC claims to have no data on antibody response months after vaccinations of over 177 million Americans. If this is true is is evidence of gross incompetency. Dr. Fauci, who is not responsible for this type of testing, now says we are gathering data and hold off on boosters for now. I have gathered enough data from simply testing my own patient’s spike protein antibody tests in the last 3 months to confirm the need for boosters based on those results. It is reprehensible that the WHO and CDC now oppose boosters in the US, while the vaccine makers are recommending   them, claiming they are “ following the science”. Ironically the CDC   says no antibody testing is recommended post vaccine because the vaccine maker’s data showed everyone made antibodies in their studies. But now when the same people recommend boosters based on their data, the CDC questions the validity. My data shows J&J vaccinated had <50%, Pfizer 85% and Moderna 98% positive antibody responses. Those with levels less than 1 need boosters now and a single shot of Moderna will likely work in most people"
2021-07-13 6:00,"The CDC advisory committee listed worldwide vaccine equity as a factor to be weighed when deciding if seniors and the clinically vulnerable should be allowed a booster shot.

I ask them the following:

""Are you folks on the CDC advisory committee, who are under 65, willing to take your upper-middle-class incomes and divide them absolutely equally with the rest of the world?   That would mean that you will agree to live on an income of  $4,129 a year.   Remember, poverty kills a lot more people a year than covid ever will."" 

Until they agree to do this, they should refrain from volunteering the elderly and other vulnerable citizens the right to a booster vaccine.  I've had it with the CDC advisory committee's ""equity for thee but not for me"" approach.

2021-07-13 6:31,The FDA is muddling the waters by not fully approving the vaccines. Perhaps Israel in recommending 3rd doses does not feel restrained by the red tape at the FDA.
2021-07-13 11:17,"Now even the medical ""experts"" are arguing amongst themselves as to the best course of action.  Of course don't you dare question their wisdom if you are not a ""scientist.""  If you do be prepared to be labeled as an anti vaxer, anti-science.  Never mind the profits that are made and endowments to medical schools by Big Pharma that may sway the public universities to mandate shots for all the students before they return to campus. If your not in a high risk category, have no underlying conditions, you must get the shot and if your injured from the injection, well this is an insignificant statistic."
2021-07-13 11:38,The number of vaccines you get should simply align with your covid fear level and your trust in big pharma. People on the left having these things in spades should probably be getting monthly vaccines.
2021-07-13 1:09,Yeah …just like masks weren’t necessary until they were…
