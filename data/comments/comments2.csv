2020-01-30 16:35,This is exactly why we don’t allow the outing of a whistleblower.  This is the kind of fear-based authoritarian country the Republicans are actively attempting to create.
2020-01-30 20:24,"""The government refused the change the culture...."" First of all, can the Chinese government ""change"" a ""culture"", especially this ""culture"" is something that lasted for thousands of years? The show makes it sound like the ""culture"" is introduced by the communist party which refuses to change it, but is it true?

Is this really just a ""culture"" in China? How long has the Flint government know about the water issue but not reporting? for years! Is that local rulers afraid of losing their power a ""China culture""?

The exact same thing happened 17 years ago. Actually, 17 years ago, it was much worse, and at that time that the city wasn't Wuhan, but Beijing.17 years later, the same thing happened but the country is acting much faster than it was in SARS. 17 years, it wasn't Xi in control. The podcast tried to say how Xi made things worse, but they fired the gun at the wrong target... 

Wuhan and Hubei government already know they made a huge mistake and at this point, entire China knows that they will lose their jobs. Tons of articles and posts shared in all Chinese social media. I was expecting BBC will provide something new, but what I heard is just something Chinese media posted a week ago. 

Now what Chinese people care and talk about is the nationwide surge of grocery prices, how they are blocked from normal activities, how Wuhan and Hubei people are discriminated against. But BBC doesn't care about the people, all it wants is find ways to point fingers at the government..."
2020-01-30 21:21,"Eight people shared the news via wechat group about the dangerous virus before government admitted ""human to human"" transmission. The eight people are all doctors. Unfortunately, police shut them down and accused them of spreading rumors."
2020-01-31 3:19,"This biased reporter makes me so mad. It's irresponsible to take pure hear-say or information gathered on social media as facts! The opinions of an ambulance doctor, an architect? Where is your prove?
You cannot make accusations and conclusions by justing talking to a few, or by guessing. We are not under house-arrest, we are under self-house-quarantine, willingly. It not ""not allowed to go out"" in cities other than Wuhan. The reporter sounds like we are forced, it's not all true. We don't want to go out to cause anymore troubles for the already over-worked local government staffs and other people. We take it as our civil duty. We are normal human beings, not savages.
Yes, initially, there are delays and cover-ups. But it's not the hospitals refuse to test patients for the new virus for the scares of finding out unwanted results, it's lacking of resources and proper testing tools!!!
I do not know which hospital has a respiratory department with thousands of empty beds just waiting. Be reasonable, please!
It's sad, the overwhelming negativities."
2020-01-31 9:33,"Coverage of this in China continues to come from such a negatively biased perspective. The bias that looks to further criticize China, looks to continue to try to force a western culture on China and expect them to approach everything as the west does. It’s easy to criticize and look for stories to reinforce the same old American biased criticisms of China. It’s disappointing to see the New York Times jump on the band wagon of “us versus them” and further the divide in extremely biased reporting."
2020-01-31 14:25,"Hi! 
I was just listening to the Guardian's Today in Focus (<a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2020/jan/30/the-race-to-contain-coronavirus-podcast"" target=""_blank"">https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2020/jan/30/the-race-to-contain-coronavirus-podcast</a>) where they praised China for the way the country has handled information this time compared to the SARS outbreak. 
Their claims seem of how China shares information in this case seems to be oposite to New York Times' claims. What is one to make of this?"
2020-02-01 1:18,"Love your podcasts. Well written, well researched and to the point. But Javier Hernandez’s angle on stories like this is becoming dull and repetitive. Do you have any local, Chinese journalists that could give us a different angle? I love the informative nature of your podcasts. But this one was extremely lacking. It seemed to focus more on rhetoric and hearsay rather than facts. And it ended with the same old authoritarian government angle we are well familiar with. Surely, you could address some more compelling questions people have about the outbreak?"
2020-01-31 0:45,"I feel very upset after listening to this episode. I generally like the daily. However, I feel this episode is not appropriate. This cronovirus is devastating for Chinese people. In my opinion, this episode should focus on the situation in China and how to save the people from the disease there, instead of criticizing the government. It makes me feel the daily is very inhumane and indifferent and try to find every way to play politics. Although the analysis is reasonable, it does not feel like the right time to express it. It feels to me that criticizing Chinese government is more important than people’s lives there. That is why this episode focuses on the government instead of how to fight the virus. I wish the daily could consider this in the future. There is a right time to express these views. Maybe after the virus is over. Right now does not seem like the right moment. This is especially hurting for your audience who cares about the people there."
2020-04-05 20:34,"I'm returning to this podcast in early Apr. after the US's numbers have surpassed China's. I'm trying to figure out if any of us imagined it would reach the US and that our citizens would also succumb to the disease. Barbarro makes one comment questioning whether the same lockdowns could be done in the US, so apparently, yes, it was a fleeting thought but at the end of Jan., I don't think any of us were thinking realistically about the possibility of it being as bad in our towns--even as it was in real time in the process of traveling to the US (and the rest of the world). Trump does bear a lot of responsibility for acting slowly, but based on the lack of alarmism (for the west) in the report, there were a lot of people who still thought it would remain a Chinese epidemic. As it turns out, US, local municipalities, and many other countries (Italy) reacted in exactly the SAME way as China (minimizing/denial, cover-up, then scrambling). 

This was a new thing for all of us."
2021-03-06 14:51,"It’s now March 2021, and I’ve just listened to this podcast. 

Oh my God, the 6,000 deaths they speak of sounds so .... tame. Insignificant.  The hundreds of thousands of deaths; the world crisis we now know of. It’s just so disheartening to think the Chinese government could have handled this better and saved so much suffering. 

As the saying goes: there’s a special place in hell for those decision makers who hid the real story. 

* I understand any deaths are not “insignificant.” Yet compared to today’s figures, it sort of feels that way."
2020-01-31 14:16,"The percentage of deaths is NOT the issue.  This article misses a key point, and that is that 20% to 25% of the cases are severe requiring hospitalization at a high level of care and isolation procedures.

Now...Do the math for ANY city.  If you have 200,000 people and 25% are infected, that is 25,000 people.  25% of that is over 6,000 people.  How many cities of that size have over 6,000 high level care beds available?  How many have over 6,000 beds of ANY type available?  THAT is where the problem lies.  By sheer numbers this virus overwhelms the medical resources available to treat patients.  The hospitals in Wuhan, a MAJOR metropolitan area, are already overrun with less than 2,500 reported cases.

Do NOT take this virus lightly by comparing the death rate to other illnesses.  What happened in Wuhan could happen in ANY American city.  I am a volunteer who serves with a local emergency management agency.  I have seen the plan to place social distancing..A polite way of saying a quarantine...Into American cities of all sizes."
2020-01-31 14:18,"Thanks to NYT for the excellent, timely, comprehensive coverage. Very informative and valuable."
2020-01-31 14:19,"I'm curious about the source(s) the authors used to get the mortality information, like the <3% mortality rate statistic and ""many of those who died were older men with underlying health problems"". Perhaps I missed this information in the New England Journal of Medicine and Lancet articles."
2020-01-31 14:22,The graph is informative and puts this in context.  The range also helps me understand that there are still unknowns.
2020-01-31 14:30,Thank you for this article. It offered all the clarity that I was seeking and put the outbreak into context. Let’s all hope the Wuhan Corinavirus falls in the bottom left of the pink box and not the top right.
2020-01-31 14:32,"It is fascinating and somewhat reassuring to see how sophisticated epidemiology has become over the last few decades. I hope this corona virus' mutation rate is low so that the mortality rate and contagiousness do not rise and most important, a vaccine will work well."
2020-01-31 14:32,"As an immunologist, there are some misleading stats in this article. First, it appears that Wuhan coronavirus is spreading at a much more rapid rate than SARS and has already exceeded the total number of people infected during the entire SARS outbreak. It increased 10-fold in the last week alone and is continuing to rise in a nearly geometric progression. It is unlikely that it will continue at that progression for a variety of reasons (although it has tracked extremely well up to now with predictions) but if it does, there will be ~100 million infections worldwide by the end of February.

Second, the mortality rate is very difficult to calculate. Yes, there have been ~200 deaths and 10,000 cases, which would imply a mortality rate of ~2%. The problem is, most of those 10,000 cases have been identified within the last couple of days (9,000 within the last week). Those patients are likely at the early stages of disease and we have no idea how many will survive and die. I would estimate that the mortality rate is probably in the 5-10% range, similar to SARS."
2020-01-31 14:42,"The 2d plot with number of people infected by each sick person (X) and mortality rate (Y) has a log scale on the Y axis. Given the enormous spread in mortality rates (bird flu ~75% to seasonal flu 0.1%) a log scale is the obvious choice but this requires some explanation for a reader who isn't a scientist/mathematician or else people will miss the point that the bird flu is 750 times more deadly the seasonal flu.

Also the bottom vertical axis label of 0 is simply wrong (unless the vertical axis is infinitely long ;-) ). The common cold and chicken pox must have a non-zero mortality. I guess 0.01% was the intended axis label which would be consistent with the other labels."
2020-01-31 14:44,"This is a good article about the disease and comparison with other viral respiratory disease.  

I would like to note that the deaths from these infections are likely to occur in older people or those already ill. The article alluded to this group. Death rates in subgroups are difficult to accurately predict with general models for disease spread. There may be a lot more deaths if and when it spreads through a population with a high percentage of people in the second half of life, for example, in the US, Japan, and Europe.

The second is that pneumonia makes people very sick even when it doesn't kill.  Patients in the working-age group are likely to miss days or weeks of work.  The economic effect of sickness like this is likely to be significant if recovery times last weeks. 

Morality from this virus is certainly being hyped, primarily on speculation and lack of information at this time.  People who get it do seem to be sicker than with usual influenza and that's something public health officials in the US may have to deal with ."
2020-01-31 15:13,"This is a great article.  The analysis is excellent, and it allows the reader to compare the threat of the Coronavirus to other well-known diseases.  It was interesting to note that the Chickenpox has a near zero fatality rate.  Is that prior to or post the vaccine?  It is a bit of a relief to see the relatively low death rate for the Seasonal flu, although there have been about 8,000 deaths reported this season.  Does the flu shot actually help with this, or do the elderly and immune- compromised populations die regardless?"
2020-01-31 15:17,"I have a problem with the estimated mortality rate.  I do not believe we will ever receive accurate information on this because (1) I do not trust the Chinese government to tell us the full truth, (2) I believe medical authorities in many areas including personnel inside of treatment facilities are deliberately misdiagnosing causes of death in elderly patients and patients who had other medical problems to which death could otherwise be attributed, such as ""severe pneumonia,"" ""chronic heart disease,"" etc., (3) because of cost and shortage of supplies, not all suspected cases are being tested and it appears that family members of both confirmed and suspected cases are not being tested, either.  Many estimates that I've seen of potential spread of the virus, the total number of infected and the death rate are much worse than what is being pumped out to us.  Could the experts at universities around the world (outside of China, that is), ALL be that far off in their analyses?"
2020-01-31 15:22,"It sounds like China has been proactive  trying to contain the virus. It also sounds like it might be a little late due to the number of people who travel from Wuhan to other areas of China, other Asian and western countries. It also appears that the elderly with existing health conditions are more vulnerable to succumb to the illness. If it is too late and the virus is spreading outside Wuhan, we might face a pandemic with high mortality among those with other conditions. 
Somehow being an optimist and after the SARS and the Ebola outbreaks, I doubt this will be the case. This is probably not the Spanish flu. That being said, we have had warnings that China needs to more proactive about the handling and consumption of food to prevent a Spanish flu in the future. All being equal, humans are due for a pandemic  to contain our numbers. Unfortunately, this is one of the ways how nature contains populations, including us humans."
2020-01-31 15:24,"All good -- and thank you for the graphics in particular -- but the projection of a <3% fatality rate *can't* be right.  

With 10,000 infected and 200 deaths reported that's already a 2% mortality, of course...and the illness, quite clearly, has certainly NOT yet run its course for those 10,000 victims.

Better estimates will probably be upwards of 5-10%.  The WHO is clearly lowballing this one, and it like any 'government' will revise its 2019-nCoV statistics over time (as judged convenient) to lessen the impact on public reaction, just as they delayed in declaring an emergency.  

As the WHO has stated, the less sophisticated a country's medical system is, the worse the outcome.  Were a North Korea to have a substantial outbreak, for instance, there'll be a revision or two to the mortality rate.  And any country's healthcare system can be overwhelmed to the point of breakdown, with the same effect.

That all sums up to a call for deliberative & appropriate action.  I actually haven't met a person or even seen anyone who's panicking, with the possible exception of those who feel the need to jump on a soapbox and blare out ""Don't panic!"""
2020-01-31 15:43,"Thanks for sharing, except that October-November's travel data is pretty skewed when comparing to December - January due to the seasonality. There's a 7-day holiday in October and Thailand, Japan are top tourism destination, whereas when it comes to December, many international students travel during the winter break. I'd expect US has much higher passengers traveling since December, and hence I hope to see more reactions to the virus in the states. The pending number hasn't been updated since 2 days ago on CDC website."
2020-01-31 15:52,Thank you for an excellent overview.  I do have an issue with the last point.  I think there will be vaccines available much faster than a year - if needed.  They need to find some good candidates and prove a lack of toxicity.  Then they can deploy that vaccine in massive clinical trials concentrated on areas of high infection rates.  They would have to state that it is not certain it will work for everybody - however it would likely be effective enough to help contain an epidemic.  Yes a fully tested approved and guaranteed effective vaccine may take a year - but if needed you can cut corners and still get the desired epidemiological effects much earlier.
2020-01-31 14:56,"It has been brought to my understanding that this virus started in a transportation hub...correct?Now the question i ask is were did the virus come from?And i ask this question because this could be a plan of the government...to possibly lower the population rates, the pollution rates, the crime rates? This could be something that the government has put into place, and let us not forget that we are still in debt with china this could be there way out us helping china and paying the debt that way it sounds crazy but just think were did this virus come from and it started in a transportation hub out of all place what would a virus like that be doing in a transportation hub on a random day china fell to an epidemic that nobody knows were it came from or how it was started this virus for all we know could have been created in a lab. And they are talking about a vaccine in a year. You might as well forget it because as it said bye the time they made a vaccine for sars they had the virus under control after it killed infected so many people. In my personel opinion i do not believe that this epidemic/virus was no accident."
2020-01-31 15:01,"Really bad decision to use the log scale for mortality.
Most people don't know what a logarithm is and will think that this virus is possibly half as deadly as Ebola.

In other words, get ready to see it replicated in social media with the explanation or labeling of the scale removed.  Panic material.

Scientifically accurate, poor choice for a mass communication."
2020-01-31 15:38,"How are Spanish Flu and SARS rated at the same level on the fatality rate axis? Considering the under reporting of SARS, it seems disingenuous to put a recent virus that reportedly killed 774 with an infamous virus that killed between 20 and 50 million. Give us another graph that shows actual death tolls, so we understand the impact of quarantine and precaution."
2020-01-31 15:07,"I am pleased that the article mentioned a comparison with typical influenza: ""For instance, even though influenza has a case fatality rate below one per 1,000, roughly 200,000 people end up hospitalized with the virus each year in the United States, and about 35,000 people die."" 

I wish that the New York Times and other media outlets would publish graphic depictions comparing infection and death by coronavirus and influenza. This might bring a little more attention to a disease we have here in the U.S. that would appear to have far more serious consequences to public heath--though apparently causing a great deal less concern."
2020-01-31 16:01,"If the control measures work, this pandemic will fall into the mists of memory ... and people will call it much ado about nothing. What other field is a success if nothing much happens?"
2020-01-31 16:04,"I love these in depth NYT assessments. As someone who works in public health, I appreciate this excellent evaluation of the facts and relative risks. Well done!"
2020-01-31 16:06,"It might be good to point out for those not used to look at graphs all day long that the death rate (y-axis) is on a logarithmic scale!

Maybe add a graph with a linear scale for comparison - much easier to grasp for most, and will also serve to NOT stoke more fear than necessary."
2020-01-31 16:17,"How does Coronavirus compare, on these same measures, to the Zika virus?"
2020-01-31 16:11,Now's probably a great time to go sightseeing in your own nation as there will be less tourists around. People have to eat in China so there will probably be more demand for food from our nation. You can get just as much vitamin k from meat and dairy as you do from veges. We have a smaller population in NZ so less chance of it spreading here and developing into some other virus before a vaccine is developed. There's a shortage of masks worldwide and I read all the people buying up masks and hoarding them to sell by price gouging are causing shortages for hospital workers.
2020-01-31 16:14,"As an ID doctor, I think this is a fantastic piece with useful visual information! thank you."
2020-01-31 16:14,"I'm not a medical professional but I'm curious, is there any specific reason the times chose to use a log scale to represent the mortality rate axis on some of the charts accompanying this article? Using such a scale could be misleading to passive viewers, the distance between the projected mortality rate of the coronavirus and far deadlier viruses such as Ebola appear very close to one another despite the initial reports (as outlined this article) that suggest the coronavirus has a morality rate 1/20th  of Ebola. Part of me wants to believe there's some academic justification for this but I feel this may have been done to intentionally fuel further press of the outbreak."
2020-01-31 14:26,Telling people not to go to work or school if they are sick is not helpful. I have had a cough and runny nose for 2 weeks. Am I suppose to sit at home during all of that time? Seriously? I wish I could.
2020-01-31 15:21,This article as well as the article about bats in the Times made me curious if there could be any relationship between the African swine epidemic in China this past year with its increase in pork costs could have perhaps made other meats more desirable compared to normal and perhaps increased the likelihood of a new virus crossing over to people than it would have otherwise.
2020-01-31 16:09,We are still left with no information about those who seek immediate medical attention after they experience the earliest symptoms.  One can surmise that being vigilant and going to the doctor at first symptoms will greatly reduce any chance of serious complications or even death but I have seen no articles regarding this.  Can you please publish an article about what to do if you feel symptoms coming on and how that will affect your chances of defeating the virus.
2020-01-31 15:16,"Pls stop calling the 1918 influenza pandemic the ""Spanish flu""

Good helpful article and very interesting comments. Thanks. Traveling to UK soon. Feeling better about it, but still taking an N100 mask."
2020-01-31 15:40,Really glad I'm flying for work this weekend. And next weekend.
2020-01-31 16:21,"Under #2, the fatality rate vs infectivity graph comparing corona to other infectious entities was very well presented. Thanks."
2020-01-31 16:25,"..Given the rate at which the disease is spreading (much more quickly than SARS)..its seems that new cases will rise to the tens of thousands within the coming weeks..  
 If that is the case, then from that point it would likely become a true global pandemic.
..-- Which means the necessity to stop the spread now is all important."
2020-01-31 15:55,"The data visualization in this article negligently uses a logarithmic Y-Axis while use a data point that does not function on logarithmic scale. Percentages are tightly defined from 0 to 100, each percent and decimal between those two numbers is inherently defined by the equality of weight and position over other numbers. Reducing the Y-Axis in size via logarithmic scaling irresponsibly shows the Wuhan coronavirus as near other diseases, which are, in fact, separated more than 80%. The New York Times data team should work with subject matter experts when creating visualizations to capture more accurately the data they wish to represent. If the Y-Axis is too large to nicely show the comparison you would like to make in a visual, might I recommend reconsidering that idea."
2020-01-31 16:31,"Fantastic graphics, especially the fatality vs transmission one. This allows us to consult history and historical fiction as we track the coronavirus and make plans (I’m checking my shelf-stable food just in case.)

The strap hanger graphic also solves a mystery for me. I’m on public transportation every day and never know how far to move away from the coughers and sneezers.

I’m not terribly worried at this point. Nevertheless, the article in today’s Guardian about all the American workers who have zero sick days could point to an ominous reason that the anti-regulatory, pro-employer USA would be less prepared than any other first world country to respond to a pandemic."
2020-01-31 16:33,"""China was not nearly as well-connected in 2003 during the SARS outbreak. Large numbers of migrant workers now travel domestically and internationally — to Africa, other parts of Asia and Latin America, where China is making an enormous infrastructure push with its Belt and Road Initiative.""

Africa and South America - no data available, or no reported infections?"
2020-01-31 16:36,"Seems like the growth rate of the Wuhan virus is actually unknown since local authorities were keeping quiet about reporting cases early on. I'm guessing the actually line looks more like SARS but will be bigger because, as the article states, it began in a major transport hub and early measures to contain it were not taken."
2020-01-31 15:29,This information is what I pay for.  Thanks NYT!
2020-01-31 16:39,Excellent!  Graphics tell the story so well.  Really appreciate this approach to presenting a lot of information in an easy to comprehend fashion.
2020-01-31 14:23,Wuhan is also river hub and you make no mention of this factor.
2020-01-31 14:42,"Once the corona virus gains a foothold in the United States, Trump can use the crisis as reason to suspend the elections in November. Thus he will be on his way to being the first American Emperor."
2020-01-31 15:22,"These numbers are problematic because they are dependent on numbers given by the Chinese government on infection and mortality occurrences in China.  Even your own reporting from Wuhan and other places note undiagnosed very ill people and unreported deaths attributable to the virus.  Xi is creating a cult of Xi and desperately trying to downplay this epidemic to cover up the crisis.  Illness, suffering, economic slow downs, deaths are a sure way to lose the Mandate of Heaven, and the Communist Party knows that as well as anyone.  I would take these numbers coming out of China with a boatload of salt."
2020-01-31 16:41,"If you take the last five days of confirmed infections and you plot them and the trendline that runs through them, the value for describing the fit of the line that runs through the data points is extremely close to 1. The actual number of confirmed cases should be growing exponentially. What the linear increase over the last five days means is that the confirmed cases probably reflect a limitation in the number of tests that can be performed in a single day."
2020-01-31 16:47,I think fomite transmission is another big unknown not mentioned here. I'm curious about the type(s) of pneumonia that go along with this virus. If they are all viral that is extra bad but if they are mostly bacterial as sequelae that's better since we have vaccines (Prevnar) - and I'm happy to have done both of them. Even without a pandemic the pneumonia vaccines are much better general protection than getting the  flu shots they try and force on everyone in every situation like this.
2020-01-31 16:40,"The log chart on the Times home page( which will lead to the article) is very confusing. The size is too small,  compresses the data and eliminates some of the digits on the side.  The actual chart reproduced in the body of the article is better, but could use an explanatory note.  Otherwise, it is a very informative article, with some good comments."
2020-01-31 15:52,Good detailed reporting. This is the kind of fact based articles that I want to see from NYTimes.
2020-01-31 14:52,Well done. Thank you.
2020-01-31 17:15,"A co-worker is hosting a couple visiting from western China, don't know what city. They arrived on Tuesday night in Los Angeles before connecting to another flight. They were not checked for fever, nor were they given a ""health card"" at the airport. I met them, chatted about their vacation. Lovely couple. 

Now I'm worried."
2020-01-31 17:15,Of course it can always mutate in quite unexpected ways. Presumably the more people it infects the higher that probability.
2020-01-31 17:22,"I am always interested when the fatality rate from Spanish flu is compared to more recent epidemics. Of course the entire nature of the disease was poorly understood. More importantly the widespread use of IV fluids was still decades away, and severe dehydration was unavoidable in many patients. In addition we essentially had no treatment for secondary bacterial pneumonias, ear infections as well as other complications related to congestive heart failure or diabetes.
     Wouldn't want to see a return of Spanish Flu, but seems possible the fatality rate would be lower."
2020-01-31 17:27,"Very useful explanation of a phenomenon that can needlessly frighten the public.  

One issue, however: I know the infectivity/mortality chart is logarithmic, but I doubt varicella (chickenpox) has zero mortality and, as such, should not be placed at the same level as the common cold."
2020-01-31 17:36,"While the article is informative, I think that the chart is less so.  People just can't understand a log scale easily, like the one used here for fatalities, unless they are used to seeing one and understand how it works.  In this case, it's use mostly just distorts the data.

No one is going to take a look at the chart and quickly understand that Ebola has 5 times the fatality rate of the Spanish flu."
2020-01-31 17:38,"Question for the experts: What, if any, is the risk of contracting this virus via objects one handles, specifically, products shipped here  from China, such as Amazon purchases? Are there precautions one should take in handling these items?
Thanks."
2020-01-31 17:45,"Are there environmental limiters to these viruses, like humidity, temperature, ? Do outbreaks subside on their own?"
2020-01-31 17:55,"The chart is interesting but confounded by two key environmental and population factors. The Spanish flu was very deadly in 1918 but the same virus might not be as deadly today since advanced medical treatment is now available. The Spanish flu also occurred during WWI which aided its spread and there were no reliable detection methods in 1918.  MERS infected a population that is, as a whole, less healthy than the Chinese population. A very high percentage of deaths due to MERS were in people with underlying medical conditions. 42% of MERS patients died in Saudi Arabia while 16% died in South Korea. Over 75% of MERS cases occurred in Saudi Arabia. This inflates the risk of death due to MERS."
2020-01-31 18:02,"Little is gained by using the log scale here, and it makes the information look much scarier than it should."
2020-01-31 18:10,"The scatter plot seems misleading. If you calculate the mortality rate by dividing the number of deaths to the number of confirmed cases, this number indeed stays constantly between 2-3%. However, it is a well-known fact in epidemiological literature that the mortality rate underestimates the case fatality rate (the probability of a disease to kill you throughout its course), because in the early exponential growth stage of the epidemic most patients are still in early stages and are not dying yet. For me, it is extremely hard to believe that the case fatality rate for the virus is less than 3%. I would put the estimate to something above 5% and closer to SARS. 
Also, WHO estimates the transmission rate between 2 and 3 and higher than for SARS. On the graph, the transmission rate range is mostly to the left of SARS. The lower transmission rate for the new virus also does not make sense given a much faster growth in cases as compared to SARS when so many preventive measures were taken this time."
2020-01-31 18:16,"Mostly nice graphics, BUT too bad you couldn't work out the y axis on the scatter plot comparing fatality and transmission rates. The acceleration makes Wuhan look more devastating than needed. You could have used equal intervals and done an inset for the details."

2020-01-31 18:51,"While the graphics are nice, the figure showing mortality vs transmission rate is a bit misleading. People can die of the common cold, often due to similar underlying conditions as people dying from coronavirus.

MERS is 30% 10 times more deadline than Cornavirus and yet on the image they look to be only twice as bad.  This is misleading.

Additionally, drawing a circle of 8000 people covering 1/10th of the US is also misleading.  There is no relationship between the number of people arriving from Wuhan and the size or scale of the US.  This is also misleading.

Then, follow them and see if it prevents them from getting the Wuhan strain or if it attenuates it.  The difference may be slight but could be the difference between life and death.  At least it's something to try until a proper vaccine is created and vetted.  Also, the scientists probably need to try that SARS vaccine as it was made and tested but never used."

Two steps should be taken quickly:
(1) Quarantaine. Minimize travel. Even if this probably does not stop the spread of the disease, it would by slowing it down at least lessen the chance that national health systems are overwhelmed.
(2) Prepare the health system for a big sudden demand. Consider and decide on the triage for all eventualities. Also, plan for all eventualities, for instance for the use of public buildings as temporary hospitals."

""The authors of the letter in the New England Journal of Medicine, who are from Munich and Berlin, said it was “notable that the infection appears to have been transmitted during the incubation period of the index patient, in whom the illness was brief and non-specific.”

“It does mean that transmission is more readily achieved than it was in SARS,” an earlier coronavirus disease, said Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious disease specialist at Vanderbilt University Medical Center. “The report from Germany indicates quite conclusively that spread during the incubation period when the person is not sick themselves can take place.”

The counter argument is that without the log scale the graph would not be readable. My view is that  the graph as printed will lead many people to believe the virus is more deadly than currently known leading to higher (unsupported) levels of concern and panic. In that case the graph should not have been printed at all. There is more than enough misinformation about this virus without the Times adding to it."
2020-01-31 21:46,Thanks for spreading so level headed und neutral information. Most newspaper articles about the disease here in Germany crave from for sensation that trying to really inform.
2020-01-31 21:49,"There are a number of ways of looking at this virus and its fatality rate.  What can be said: It’s way too early for actual facts because there are so many unknowns!  

If you take the number of confirmed infected and compare it to actual deaths, then the virus has about a 2% fatality rate.  Currently, this isn’t a very accurate method!

If you take the number of people who were admitted into hospital, then the fatality rate is 20% (using the same standard for the current flu season gives us a 7% fatality rate.)  The numbers are meaningless because people, who are dying, as a rule, had pre-existing medical conditions.  It is also not that scientific!

What is certain:  A large number of people developed pneumonia before dying.   There is also preliminary evidence of a large number of Cytokines in the bodies of the victims.

So we have a virus that not much is known about, hard to detect without blood tests, possible transmission by people showing no symptoms, and victims with pre-existing medical conditions developing pneumonia.  

Generally healthy people seem to fight off the disease.  It's victims with compromised immune systems dying!

The important thing, use reputable websites for information like the CDC/major news sources, avoid websites like Facebook/Twitter/Blogs, get updated on vaccinations, avoid touching your face and wash your hands frequently!"
2020-01-31 21:58,"If you don't know what a log scale is, the cartesian plot of deadliness vs. contagiousness could actually make you panic more than is warranted.  I get why it was compressed, but it seems like a bad choice in this case."
2020-01-31 22:15,"The mortality rate of the new corona virus is important to note— it is relatively reassuring that “only”  about 2.2% of those infected die.  Not good but better than SARS or MER.

What is worrisome is according to WHO figures, approximately 20% of cases are categorized as severe.   Given that this seems to really be a pneumonia virus, I am concerned about the long-term morbidity in survivors (more so after reading several articles from the Lancet and NEJM).  Will those who survive severe cases end up with badly scarred lungs and diminished functional capacity post infection?"
2020-01-31 22:17,"Well, it was bound to happen. Humanity has modified considerably the natural ecology: China has four times more travellers than ten years ago. In its booming human population, contacts are much more frequent, enabling the evolution and explosion of much more virulent viruses, and other microbes. Besides the gathering global warming provides microbes with new ecological niches in which defenses against them have not been evolved. 

The solution is of course to fabricate a vaccine within weeks, not months. Thus, we need much more investments in fundamental biological research. Having preliminary results on the nature of the virus, already, is encouraging.

This situation with corona viruses is a particular case of a much more general problem: humanity is messing up its nest,  while, at the same time, booming in population and travelling. This brings increasing opportunities but also increasing dangers. The solution is to push research to solve these problems ever faster, fast enough to avoid catastrophe. Thus, we have to invest ever more in fundamental research, because it is intimately tied to pursuing basic rights like life and happiness. 

Fundamental research in science and technology is not just what it used to be, a possibility, a calling, or contributing to civilization and honoring the human spirit. The very success of this enormous human population and the Anthropocene it has created has turned fundamental scientific research into a moral obligation."
2020-01-31 22:23,"The first reports that NCOV bearing persons are contagious before symptoms appear is weak-and probably invalid. These first reports were not documented properly. It now appears, after a few weeks of activity, that this virus behaves like other know viruses and that persons who are asymptomatic are not infective. 

In China, first hospital cases were those with compromised immune systems. It now appears that many of confirmed infections are mild and do not need hospitalization. To date, there have been no deaths in cases outside of China. 

The virus will run a course in China with many new infections but those will diminish in a few weeks and drop off drastically. As newer infections become known the ratio of deaths to infections will decrease-which speaks to morbidity of this virus-which is low. The diagrams on this article are misleading regarding morbidity. 

For US to ban entry to travellers who have been in China is overkill and unwarranted. The US heath policies are just acting out of fear and not out of good science."
2020-01-31 22:41,It is interesting that there were no quarantines for Ebola in Western Africa a few years ago.

2020-01-31 23:21,"I read in Science, a few years after the Sars epidemic, that it was spread in an apartment building that had bathroom floor drains that were never used, resulting in the traps drying out and leaving a direct air connection between apartments and sewage leaving the building.

I saw the flight details of the passengers arriving into NZ from Wyong days before it landed. The Government let them land.
Then they then have since travelled around NZ and some tourist spot owners have been shocked when hundreds of people leave their holiday in a rush upon hearing of their arrival.  Up until 2 days ago we had to send our testing to Australia which took 2 weeks for a result. 
We didn't have compulsory testing set up from flights that have landed from affected counties and we still don't.
Everything is about if they 'feel ok' with being tested. How would someone 'feel' if their own family were affected?
Nothing is compulsory here. 
The other thing is that we are still taking passengers from these areas. 
Lastly, we have had to work with the kindness of Australia to get our own residents out and as far as I know, they are still there currently.

Overall my questions are-
 Is the Tourist dollar really that important? 
What will the cost be on the health system? 
Why is NZ not looking after its Kiwis?"

Assuming 20% of case are acute and require hospitalization, that is 27,890,200 inpatient confinements and assuming an ongoing 2% death rate despite the overwhelming of available supplies of healthcare providers and hospitals, that means possibly 2,789,020 deaths.   Now if we start looking at infection rates of 20% to 30% and mutations as the virus evolves tho  above numbers become plague like.  Yes it is not the Black Death, but in our day and age, it might as well be since no nation can handle the strain on its healthcare delivery system and anarchy and severe economic and social disruptions could occur resulting in political instability."

It detailed people who have tested positive for the virus but not confirmed because of a lack of the confirmation testing availability. Apparently there are thousands at home who are positive but not counted in the official count. The caution remains in the fact that this is a novel virus. It mutates the more it spreads and the lethality could change. The fact that it has spread to over 10,000 confirmed cases in less than 30 days is alarming. It took MERS several months to reach the total number of cases which was just over 8,000 cases."

2020-02-01 0:39,"I think your estimate of the fatality rate is, unfortunately, far too low.  The reason is that the high proliferation rate (reported cases are going up a factor of 10x every week) skews the naive estimates lower.

When the case load is growing exponentially, you can't just divide the deaths by the total cases, because those who have died got the disease earlier.  You have to divided by the number of fdiagnosed cases, when they were diagnosed.

Estimate the mean time between diagnosis and death and work backwards to get the corrected population size. 

By my calculations, if the diagnosis to death time is 7 days, the fatality rate is around  29%.  If it is 10 days, the fatality rate is 84%!  

That is still a crude model, but at least it's not obviously biased.    The right way to look at siurvival rates is with a Kaplan-Meier Graph with patients sorted by age, gender, and any other prognostic indicators.

I'm afraid this epidemic is going to be a bad one.   

That is not a sign of panic or dispair.  It's just what the data is telling me.    The sooner we understand and accept that unpleasant reality and adapt to it, the better our odds for long term survival will be."

We’ve been warned about a potential superbug outbreak for years, and now we can see how the response will look like. No doubt the Chinese government is busy taking notes on what it could have done better.

“Not to mention, I don’t think most Westerners realize just how big Wuhan is, just how significant Chinese New Year is in terms of people moving around and just how many people go in and out of those wet markets every day. That’s like, tens of thousands of people leaving the wet markets, taking public transport then going home to expose all their visiting relatives, and all those people in turn going to all sorts of crowded areas too. With a high enough contagion rate, we’d easily be at 1 million infected. The fact that we haven’t reached such numbers means that this virus isn’t That bad.”"

I used to think that, eventually, laws of political gravity would catch up to him, as they have to most presidents in my lifetime. But I now realize that only applies to Democrats, given the new reality of the FOX News gaslighting era. There have indeed been things that should've weighed on this president, like  unexpected consequences of trade wars described here. But when FOX and Limbaugh, et al., unfailingly blame others and laud Trump, no matter what happens, I'm not sure luck and normal political consequences matter anymore.

Every one of their policies can be traced to an agenda of a GOP friendly donor or interest group.
Ross' economic views are informed by his (and many Trump supporting businesspeople) that their wealth and success means that they are qualified to pronounce policy on issues they imagine they are qualified in. ""I am wealthy thus I am smart"" is scarcely the credential Americans want or need.
This is, of course, not limited to economic and fiscal policy but extends to immigration, climate change, health, tax policy, the environment, free speech and so on.
In short, the policies of this administration are driven by fantasy, superstition, bigotry and greed promoted by tireless media blitzes promoting their untruths."

In their xenophobic eyes, it seems, America should be isolated from all other countries in manufacturing, trade, research, and every other endeavor. They don't seem to understand that an isolated America would fall behind the rest of the world, which would happily be enjoying progress through collaboration. America would become like the Soviet Union in the 1980s. And given Putin's influence over Trump, maybe that is precisely the program."

Simply claiming he will bring EVERY manuafacturing job ""back"" to America is unrealistic because so many of the component parts of everyday devices have NEVER been  made in USA, and never will be.
  Trump has been happy to take credit for ""great economy"" when EVERY growth chart showed the economy has, so far, continued to grow in a straight line since 2010.

I don't think fear will help with the scientific challenge."

But speaking of appalling, there’s an issue here that is much bigger than economics. This virus has already killed hundreds of people, and it will probably kill thousands more before it's contained. Yet we don't even know for sure if we CAN contain it, and the death toll could be much worse. And even if you believe the deaths of Chinese people somehow aren't important, at some point it will also kill some Americans, and maybe many.

Our skilled scientists and health official are working hard to help contain the virus. Yet all one of our top government officials can do is breathlessly speculate on how these deaths can help us make a few bucks by manufacturing a few more widgets.

The impeachment hearings in the Senate are helping us see how evil the Trump administration is, but Secretary Ross is just pouring gasoline on that fire. How could our once-great nation have sunk so low?

(The right answer to the discussion on Fox News was, of course, “Hey, our fellow human beings are dying; it’s hardly the time to discuss how this could in any way now or in the future help us to make money.

I have a suggestion for everyone here.   Rather than just complain about Trump,  if you are not already doing so, get out of your comfort zone and work to change who is leading our government at both the state and federal level.   This means door to door canvassing, making phone calls and talking to friends as if your life depends on it  - - because it may.  If not for you, for future generations.  Don’t ignore state government.  State house and senate races are often a good place to start if you have never worked on a campaign before.  You might like it and even make a few new friends.   We are already canvassing in Kansas despite snow and low temperatures.

If you live in a blue state and have no one to work against, consider helping out good candidates in red states by sending a small donation.   For example, the Democrats in Kansas have a great candidate in Barbara Bollier for US Senate.  We have no choice, we must take the Senate back to stop the damage on the Supreme Court.

“Ah,” says Maria Bartiromo in reply, “that’s a good point.”

No, in fact, it’s not. It’s an astonishingly wrong-headed take that is barely human. I’ve long believed that the basic business philosophy of the American corporate class is fraud.

For example, when Wilbur Ross says a circumstance will be economically favorable, it doesn’t mean it will benefit the economy, nor any sector of it.  He means it offers an opportunity for some elderly and obscenely wealthy industrialists and financiers to make a killing on investments of a type ordinary working Americans cannot even understand. Think of the secondary market ripples for futures  contracts on your oil depletion allowances you get for indirectly owning a string of obsolete Texas oil refineries, for example. Just imagine what a word salad Betsy deVos could make of something that benefits the owners of private, religious-affiliated schools if they can get their hands on more of the money that’s supposed to fund public schools, for example. Or the many ways to sing the advantages of increasing the rate of despoilage of our water resources or the air we breathe, in comparison to something you can really sink your teeth into like the overnight rate banks charge each other on short term loans and how much you can skim off before you brush your teeth tomorrow.

So what the net on jobs might be I don't know enough to guess. But I suppose if I were a Cabinet Secretary and ignorant enough to think manufacturing jobs could be 'turned on' like a light switch, then I might not be aware of the downside risks of shutting down a key part of so many global supply chains.

They 'appear clueless' because they know they cannot appear smarter than Trump. Those who appear to be smarter than Trump (Flynn, Kelly, Comey, Bolton, Manigault, and so many more) all get shoved out the door, sometimes via Tweet.

Given this administration's woeful lack of compassion and comprehension of the world as it is now, I fear that their only response will be to ignore the problem until it's too late.  

We're all connected whether we like it or not.  We don't have be friendly with a nation to assist them in a time of great need.  Our common humanity suggests that we will.  Of course the way Chris Christie behaved about Ebola gives me second thoughts but I think that it's time we got over our ignorance about how disease is spread and stopped destroying our environment.  A great many of the newer diseases that are dangerous to us are zoonotic.  They've jumped from an animal like a bat or a mouse to us.  We are invading their space.  

After this, if there is an after, it's time for us to look at the world we are creating and decide if we want a disease ridden existence or one where the animals carrying those diseases can remain within their ecosystems.  But that's another editorial/story.

Mr Krugman is probably right that it will be more disruptive. One woman testing positive on an Italian cruise ship just emptied a vessel of 7,000.
And she could still have only the common cold strain and not the new strain."

Of course he sees a pandemic as an opportunity for our nation to get rich."
2020-01-30 23:23,It is breathtaking that Mr. Ross said such a stupid thing. Obviously he does not understand the problems of secondary and tertiary effects from a massive health emergency.

2020-01-31 1:33,"Wilbur Ross has already (and repeatedly) shown himself to be woefully out of touch with most day-to-day occurrences, and not just about jobs returning to America because of the Coronavirus.
But like every other tragedy or natural catastrophe, it's actually ""good"" for Team Trump because it serves as yet another distraction from the impeachment trial which will probably vote to acquit him.
And in spite of the galloping death toll and no known cure in sight, it's just business as usual for a president who has mastered the ability of self-preservation."
2020-01-31 1:34,"Trump's cabinet continues to demonstrate not only that he and they are incompetent but incredibly dangerous.  Their undermining of science and journalism for political purposes puts us at increased risk when real crises like these come up.  Their is lack of critical and especially of honest thinking among all of them.  they make decisions for personal gain, personal biases rather than for the benefit of the American or World community.  Hopefully, the children and grandchildren of his supporters will not suffer the consequences of their actions but I fear, it may be too late."
2020-01-31 1:38,"May I ask how those who do not have health insurance will fare if the coronavirus or something else similar, or worse, is not contained? From what I understand China has more accessible health care than the USA. It means possibly that many more Americans could die and how is that good for any economy?"
2020-01-31 1:41,"As usual, outstanding analysis from Mr. Krugman, not to mention excellent prose. Does his wife edit his commentary perchance? In any case the animal to human transmission of viruses that have the potential for world-wide death in the millions is one of the many downsides of Chinese culture, in this case the existence of so-called ""wet markets"", i.e. outdoor markets where animals are slaughtered on demand from buyers. Chinese culture ancient of course and admirable, but the existence of ""wet markets"" disastrous for the overall Chinese population, not to mention derivatively when viruses therefrom spring, for the Chinese government."
2020-01-31 1:44,"I write again for the umpteenth time:  Today's Republican businessmen seem to know NOTHING about business.  They don't seem to understand that wealth does not come from being the King of the Hill and stuffing all the money in your mattress.  Wealth comes from the FLOW of money, from the cash to cash cycle, from Cash > Materials > Inventory > Sales > Cash.  

And note:  Everyone is involved in that cycle.  It is not a cycle of businessmen bouncing up and down on their pile of cash.  It is a cycle of investors putting their cash to work, employing workers to mine/produce materials, which are transported by transport companies to workers who produce the inventory, which is transported to sales people who sell the goods to consumers who put more cash into the cycle.

Wilbuurrrrrrr isn't the worst businessman in the world.....unfortunately, he's just a representative businessman."
2020-01-31 1:53,"""These days we live in a world of global value chains, in which much of what any given nation imports consists not of consumer goods but of “intermediate” goods that it uses as part of its own production process.""

Great article.  As usual, Wilbur ""Cyprus"" Ross earns his vacant look by his comments, as if manufacturing were still like it was in the 50s when countries specialized in making things from A to Z.  

Clearly the world deals in suppy chains and just in time sourcing and inventory in order to reduce overhead.  But Ross whose true experise isn't in global economics but in shorting storks based on Trumpian tweets about how quickly China is going to ""come around,"" is going to be left holding the bag when China grinds to a halt.

Flights to China are stopping, and I""m sure that incudes freight transport flights.  That will disrupt other countries economies, dragging the whole global economy down.

Kind of tough to short stocks on that news, right Mr. Ross?"
2020-01-31 2:05,"Wilber Ross can put his money, or our money as it is, to ramping up mass production of supplies that would be needed if we do have an epidemic. I would brainstorm with the known established manufacturers to lead the effort to buy factory space and equipment and get going. If the Chinese can erect a couple of hospitals in Wuhan in just two weeks, we can certainly compete in that regard. Roll up your sleeves and get to it, please."
2020-01-31 2:17,"These companies have far more than two countries to choose from.   Some economic questions might be a 2- or a 3-way race.   Others are countless choices for a given company (like Amazon's corporate welfare auction last year).  According to Forbes & WSJ - 3 months ago - tariffs had caused companies to relocate to Vietnam more than anyplace else.  At last count, Vietnam had fewer virus cases than the U.S.  Why Ross imagines this might go differently, I don't know.  Or maybe just to remind us how they perceive a global pandemic simply as a chance to get ahead."
2020-01-31 2:24,"Paul, I was with you - until your last two words:  “Be afraid.” 

Ok, I’m afraid.  But I’m not sure what to fear.  Unless it’s the sheer incompetence of the current “administration” (put in quotes because it’s a word that seems to be the exact opposite - for the Trump regime - of what it usually means).

So now I’m afraid.  I’m anxious.  And could you be more specific about what exactly I should fear?  Or is our broken Republic and Constitution on life-support exactly the answer?"
2020-01-31 2:30,"Correct that in the world of supply chains we live in China’s disruptive virus is not a blessing likewise a curtailment of China’s potentially massive consumption, first being notice in tourism, is likewise no blessing for America unless pursued. 
Unmentioned of course is when did previous administrations reasonably deal with the lingering effects of China’s rise as, now according to the world bank, the world  largest economy? 
Time for a new generation of policy makers to bring us in line with the world as it is come 2021."
2020-01-31 2:31,"45 decriminalizes accidentally killing birds.  He has thrown out the landmine protections.   And there are mostly climate deniers in the WH.  45 is unfettered from any boundaries and his cabinet and Congress do not care.  These two I mentioned do not represent any agenda ad much as someone or some persons who work with him find these items and push a paper in fromt of him and he signs.  The leap from landmines to birds is too odd.  He does not read or have interest in regulations except to undo them, and he is not that into research, so who are these people?
I think 45 does not like himself and he is insecure about himself.  Doing what other people say has gotten him far.  Any body feel some concern?"
2020-01-31 2:32,"There's another economic vulnerability and another reason (as if life and death of Americans weren't enough) Team Trump and should worry about when leaving the country's doors relatively open to the coronavirus, one with a lot of political traction to come this year: the inadequacy, complexity and un-affordability of our healthcare system.

Already, there are those who won't go to a doctor until an illness has become life-threatening, revealing that private health insurance is not a good way to prevent epidemics as it is. Plus,  illegal immigrants may hesitate to register themselves at a hospital.  Then, there are the gaps in Medicare and Medicaid.  

Then see what happens if, as a result of the spread of the virus,  there are more patients than hospital beds and waiting rooms, not to mention more than our ER's can handle.    

And then look at the red ink on the balance sheets of medical providers, and the personal bankruptcies of patients who literally could not afford to get sick.

Could someone (please) points out to ""Team Trump"" that this is no game, and there's no victory lap in it for anyone.  It's is one hot potato of a calamity in the making, and accounting for it will come home to roost in November at the expense of the party whose leaders failed to prevent it.

If you think you can shoot someone on 5th Avenue, think twice about effectively shooting thousands."
2020-01-31 2:42,"I am in Beijing.  I am beginning to get more afraid of the fear in the United States than of getting coronavirus in China, which at the moment is .0000005 of the population infected, and a much smaller number of deaths. Some perspective please?"
2020-01-31 2:45,"Wilbur Ross was the guy who said steel and aluminum tariffs didn't matter because aluminum was such a small part of the value of a can of beer. 

But it turned out (surprise, Wilbur!) that steel and aluminum are much bigger components of farm equipment, cars, trucks, oil and gas pipelines and other stuff. How is a Commerce Secretary supposed to know stuff like that? OK, he did have some experience selling a US steel company off to a foreign steelmaker, while foisting their pension obligations off on the US government. 

But steel price increases over 30% led to US manufacturing slowdowns and quiet tariff rollbacks to the biggest importers to the US, South Korea, Mexico and Canada.  

But Wilbur has earned permanent immunity by bailing out Trump in his casino fiasco and allowing him to retain control. 

That is how the Big Money Club works."
2020-01-31 2:45,"It’s good for the mega-wealthy, who will get top care and survive. Those are the only folks Team Trump has ever cared about."
2020-01-31 2:50,"There's another part to the economic impact - the threat of a global pandemic is ever present and real.  It probably won't be coronavirus but new bugs will keep popping up, eventually we will be faced with a new Spanish flu.  Meanwhile we're cutting CDC funding and weakening our public health capacity.  It's sad that our leaders don't care about safeguarding American's safety and economic well-being from a potential catastrophe, but only how to line their own pockets if it occurs."

Include the animal kingdom in the equation and the odds of having to confront a virus we can't ward off becomes highly probable.  The climate crisis is bond to make matters worse.   

The fact that the Trump Administration is in the process of rolling back environmental protections, while preventing proper medical care for residents , citizen and non-citizen alike  means that we are not prepared to deal with eventual pandemic when it does arrive.  Believe a pandemic can not happen here,  read about the Spanish Flu of 1918. This is no time for apathy."

Think of derivatives tied to YUAN, YEN, DOLLAR, further tied to interest rates, mortgages of intl real estate, industrial metals, oil, and the reduction of velocity of circulation, coming from international financial paralysis .

2020-01-31 3:31,"There are other aspects of economic impact that are not quantifiable and thereby outside the realm of Wilbur Ross and Paul Krugman---that is the impending loss of intellectual capital for China.  Educated Chinese professionals and students who were the backbone of China's economic miracle will emigrate, and further the ones in US schools will be less likely to go back, making it difficult for China to compete in the long run."
2020-01-31 3:33,"At the risk of repeating myself: ""If Trump said the virus is under total control in our country, I'd be very, very concerned since he is ordinarily under-informed and generally dishonest. Only someone who routinely neglects details communicates judgements of that type. He's exactly the type of leader one does not want in a real crisis."""
2020-01-31 1:32,"Hard to fathom how news media and governments are crying wolf over a virus that's a blip on the mortality radar but continue business-as-usual with the climate crisis, which is already upon us and wreaking havoc that will eventually disrupt all life as know it. 

Colossal devastation will follow a small rise in global temperature, with frightening preview trailers already playing across the globe, including the bush conflagration in Australia, which is in the death grip of the fossil fuel mafia and their bought and paid for political apologists. 

While the bush fires rage close to Australia's Capitol city, corrupt politicians yawn in response while dramatically dispatching jumbo 747s to fetch a few Australians from a viral panic to be quarantined on an island like the non-white refugees sequestered until some other country takes them. 

Forget ""roos"" and koalas, Australia's future icon is an ostrich, a creature not known for its intelligence but so far has proved smarter than Aussies and their preferred leaders. 

The UN health agency, WHO, today declared a global health emergency, which sounds significant but only if we ignore the fact that the UN declared a similar global emergency over climate change years ago. 

Wilbur Ross, a multi-millionaire notorious for fleecing tens of millions from his employees, is America's answer to Scott Morrison, the Aussie dunce of a prime minister. 

When the world needs smart, all we get is stupid while a tiny few get very rich."
2020-01-31 2:09,"Paul reports:    ""Last week the White House basically admitted that tariffs on steel and aluminum have done more harm than good, ... the administration’s answer isn’t a reconsideration of its policies — it is to impose more tariffs, on a wider range of products.""

Your Administration is saying:  ""The whippings will continue until morale improves.""

Both thoughts come from the same kind of unilluminated mind."
2020-01-31 1:41,"If you are an entrepreneur to ponder on building a new factory here in the USA or in China, you might be a little more biased to the USA after this unfortunate outbreak to everyone in the world, and especially to Chinese.

Wilbur Ross is the chief sales officer in the USA and he might want to sell more products and services made in America at all costs. It surely is not a good timing to show such desire, but we can regard this as his focus and passion for his job at least. 

Now, I can see he is working for the country as much as he did for his own fortune without doubt."

Nicholas Kristof blames the virus outbreak on the authoritarian nature of the Chinese government. Yes, China has an authoritarian government, but, NO, having an authoritarian government was not the cause of the outbreak. WHO, and others have praised China's response. Our own democratic government was  monumentally slow to respond to the AIDS epidemic."

2020-01-31 3:20,Secretary Ross probably thinks that the destruction of Europe and Asia in World War II was the greatest thing that every happened for the American economy.
2020-01-31 2:06,The commerce secretary did not just fail microbiology; he failed decency. But we shouldn't worry about Donald Trump failing at anything. His base is secure in the knowledge that he's a genius. And that means that if the bug really became a problem here no one wearing a MAGA hat would get it.
2020-01-31 2:34,"Forget about economics. What kind of a inhumane jerk talks about an outbreak of a deadly disease in terms of how  favorably it will impact job growth here? 

But in fairness to Ross, at least he didn't gleefully design policy to maximize separation of families and put children in cages, like Stephen Miller. 

Is there even a shred of empathy or decency in the entire Trump administration?"
2020-01-31 2:52,"trumpists, especially their Savior, have a bizarre fantasy that there are two places to do business - China and the US.  If they aren't in China, then they must go to the US.  Wrong.  There are in fact other places:  India, Pakistan, Indonesia, Vietnam, Thailand, Philippines, Bangladesh, even European places like Bulgaria, Poland, and Romania.  

So trumpists, if you were a business owner with a plant in China, assuming you want to move, what would you do?  Move from China, a low cost location, to the US with among the highest costs in the world?  If so, why weren't you there in the first place?"
2020-01-31 2:36,"Honestly didn't know who the Acting Surgeon General was until today.

2020-01-31 2:13,This callous administration is more worried about the economy than they are about the vast number of people who have already and still might contract this virus.  Unfortunately China kept this virus a tight secret before they  finally realized  just how hard it would hit.  Also unfortunate is that we might have to do without a few things that come from China.  Small sacrifice considering the alternative.

2020-01-31 1:44,"I was horrified to see the ""committee"" of people in Washington gathered over the virus.  Many were smiling and it seemed more like a photo op than a serious consideration of how this virus could impact our citizens.  American Airlines still runs a plane back and forth to China.  Really?  That is just crazy.  Someone who is an informed health official needs to take charge of monitoring this epidemic and keeping people safe.  Republicans can get this deadly virus as much as Democrats.  Plus, Trump does these huge rallies, and who knows if someone will be carrying the Corona virus."
2020-01-31 3:54,Some day in the future historians will write about this administration and how detached they are from reality.  Donald J Trump has a way of underestimating a crisis.   The only thing that he seems to care about is using a crisis to attempt to further his hollow political ambition.

Now, imagine that this (relatively, for now) small outbreak balloons and, more than just disrupting supply chains, seriously  tanks the Chinese economy. 

Ya think they'll call in their loans to make up for it? And then what happens when the US defaults on those loans? The Treasury's credit rating tanks. And then you can say hello to the next Great Depression."

""Ghastly as it may seem to say this, the terror attack -- like the original day of infamy, which brought an end to the Great Depression -- could even do some economic good.

So the direct economic impact of the attacks will probably not be that bad. And there will, potentially, be favorable effects.

The driving force behind the economic slowdown has been a plunge in business investment. Now, all of a sudden, we need some new office buildings.""

It always seemed that they were all about selfishness and greed. 
Over the years all of their policies appeared designed to benefit the rich at the expense of the country. 
The country’s infrastructure has been crumbling  without any concern. 
Republican plans always involve “privatization”, meant to benefit the rich. 

The Republican Senate voting against the truth, country, and Constitution unfortunately doesn’t surprise me at all. 

It fits a pattern, and I would have been shocked if they would have done the right thing. 

We have found the swamp."

But where will it come from?  The U.S. Center for Disease Control, with its newly enhanced Division of Thoughts and Prayers?

Or will it come from China?  And if so, what happens to the value of U.S. medical technology when the premiere U.S. institution is eclipsed?

Wilbur Ross is a failure as a human being, but we’ve come to expect that. What’s genuinely worrying is the potential failure of the U.S. medical system to protect the U.S. public. No one knows if this might happen, but it has an economic cost that can’t be offset by an uptick in cremations."
2020-01-31 5:51,"Whether the virus turns out to be a boon or bane, this immediate situation reminds me of a fact that is almost never addressed and seldom considered, apparently. What happens if the ""value chain"" around the world suddenly stops working? What happens if you can't import teddy bears and micro-video cams and everything else from China and Asia generally?

We have made ourselves all but utterly dependent on shipping schedules, international flights and high speed communication links. A war could break all of that overnight. This epidemic, if it blows up into a complete threat around the world, could have something like the same impact.

This is a warning to us and a warning to companies like Apple, Dell and hundreds of others that are completely at the mercy of having other people half a world away assemble the products they sell. The corporations and their CEOs don't care...at least, they don't care until they have to care and then they could go into a complete panic.

Watch this situation very carefully and keep your hand on the sell button on your stocks. China could be the hardest hit but all the world could share in the misery."
2020-01-31 5:51,"Agreed, ""he has faced essentially no crises, domestic or foreign, that weren’t of his own making"", but even here Trump has shown his callous ineptitude and cruelty as shown by Hurricane Maria and Puerto Rico.

The excellent and illuminating performance will be shown again  in theaters across the country on Saturday."

People are up or down, disposable or valuable, higher or lower than others. When respect for one another replaces both unfounded rejection and unlimited reverence we can think differently.

2020-01-31 11:31,"Sure Wilbur Ross' cluelessness about economics is concerning, his vulgarity in wishing sickness and death on the Chinese people revolting, but coronavirus brings sharply into focus how truly dangerous Trump's ignorance and hubris really are.  Too early to know for sure but it appears that coronavirus is unlikely to go pandemic, perhaps less dangerous in the end than SARS or MERS.  Let's devoutly hope and pray so.  But if America faced a real pandemic can you imagine this administration, for that matter any GOP administration or politician, leading a successful or effective American response?  Economics are important.  We all need to provide for our families and that's economics.   But Trump should teach us that intangibles like honesty, decency, compassion, intellectual curiosity, the humility to listen to others and especially those with knowledge and experience, and at least a modicum of intelligence are far more essential characteristics to look for in our leaders than the candidates supposed  personal economic success."

2020-01-31 12:40,"The new corona virus poses a much bigger potential threat to the economy than disruption of imports if it reaches pandemic proportions.  If it's no worse than, say, a really bad seasonal flu year, millions of Americans will become ill and 70-80,000 will die.   In addition to not understanding this, Secretary Ross seems not to understand or care that these (like the Chinese victims!) would be actual human beings suffering and dying.  

Given the level of competence of the upper levels of the administration I have little confidence that the government will have an effective response should a pandemic occur."
2020-01-31 12:44,"I don't trust Wilbur Ross or the Trump administration with economic crisis either. However, may I offer an alternative perspective?

Perhaps the low prices associated with global economic supply chains don't reflect the true risks associated with global economic supply chains. We should consider this question carefully in the context of global climate change.

China is dealing with a epidemic which will ground workers indefinitely. Said workers can't arrive at factories to produce widgets used in XYZ US production. US production therefore for suffers and prices rise. Okay. We get that.

The bad news is the epidemic is happening at the peak of Chinese travel worsening the impact of the disease. The good news is the epidemic is happening at the peak of Chinese travel meaning most supply chains have already planned for shipment delays due to Chinese New Years. The factories are mostly closed this month anyway.

However, lets imagine this were a flood or a drought or some other severe climate related event. What happens to US production and/or consumption when extreme weather events happen elsewhere? 

Japan’s 2011 tsunami was caused by an earthquake but the experience provides a telling example. Natural events like disease or weather emergencies are already becoming more likely with climate change. The more extended your supply chain, the more vulnerable your industry. You need to diversify each piece your supply chain geographically.

Smaller scales. Prices rise anyway."

It is a really funny show. 
On the serious side China is trying to prove it has 21st technology to showcase its advancements. In the past few years America has fallen behind in research engineering technology, with current administration giving science further demotion. (Except for rocket science meshing NASA).

2020-01-31 13:09,"Krugman's point about how interdependent manufacturing is, with pretty much the whole world's economy involved in making one product, raises, for me, the issue of how fragile the world economy is. Disruption in one place, like a disease in China, disrupts economies everywhere. 

With the climate crisis coming as a huge disruptor, one that the Pentagon speculates could cause the collapse of our economic infrastructure in as little as a couple decades, all this global interdependence could end rather badly. We don't just need to switch to renewable energy and regenerative agriculture, we need resilient economies, economic relationships that can handle the slings and arrows of the climate crisis. 

The disruption from the coronavirus is telling us something, how fragile the world economy is."

Willbur Ross sees a gold lining in this for america and maybe if it helps focus attention on the meed for ""health care for all"" it will be. 

The disruptive capacity of pandemics is not new news, but the idea that the disruption can be quarantined or held at bey by high walls is medieval thinking. The only way to address the disruptive effects is to have healthcare available to all in danger of falling ill. A fever and a cough will not select out people with the right health care coverage, it can find its way to someone without insurance , underinsured or just visiting America. 

American hospital emergency rooms can easily be overwhelmed by the worried well and fearful of having had contact with someone known to have been infected. Intensive care units can filled rapidly placing hospital resources under severe strain. In short Ross does not understand the economics of health care and does not understand why an emergency health insurance system needs to be organized and yes...funded.  It is clear that America is not prepared economically for the effects of a pandemic on our medicals system. It is also clear that our medical system is putting us in as much danger as the coronavirus itself!"

Paul Krugman makes the accurate and factual observation that global supply chains can't be interrupted without a lot of bad fallout. 

Let's be even more simplistic. Just how fast will we be able to build factories to make steel, phones, washers, air conditioner condensers, and countless consumer products, sub-assemblies and other goods so that we can take advantage of China's deadly epidemic?  Factories don't just pop-up. If they did, they'd pop-up in Bangladesh, Malaysia, the Philippines, Korea, Taiwan - close to where supplies of things like ore are taken out of the ground.

With the impact of air travel, no country can guarantee isolation from such a virus.  Not only will a pandemic of this nature harm China, it will disrupt production there, and it will disrupt supply chains.  Once such a virus appears to any extent in the US, disruption will be magnified, because people will decrease shopping, decrease face-to-face business, and if they are caring for anyone with a fever, they will need to put themselves on quarantine.  With the SARS threat, in the context of specialty medical care, we planned to eliminate all but strictly necessary office practice care, to limit hospitalizations to urgent/emergency only, and to protect the health of our physician and nurse staff by limiting overall contact with the public.  You do not know who is incubating a virus, so you limit potential exposure.  Obviously, you wash hands as normal practice, but in an epidemic situation, you wash even more.  Conventional face masks are of limited utility to prevent infection, so you need the inconvenient HEPA mask, but that still does not fully prevent transmission by droplet into the eyes.  So, the cost of coronavirus in the US will be profound, a disruption of normal activity, time and cost for re-education, certainly disruption of elective healthcare."

here in Europe we acknowledge that approx. 30-40% of the population somehow seem perfectly happy with a corrupt Republican party and a narcissistic psychopath as a President.
Here a small number (approx. less then 10%) are also very happy with the situation (extreme right mostly) but for the most people in Europe remain flabbergasted how-in-God's-name-this-is-possible in the USA.

Nevertheless there seems to be a majority of US citizens that disagree with most points from Trump and his cronies and oppose the destruction of the democratic values by the Republican party.

The big questions here for us are:
Why aren't people massively protesting against this?
Why isn't the Democratic party mobilising the people who do care about a sane version of the USA?
Can anyone explain this? It sometimes appears to be as if people already gave up. Disheartening and worrisome."

If thousands die from this virus and factories in China are affected, um, there are billions of people over there.  a willing and able worker pool from which to back fill any openings.The coronavirus won't affect this situation anymore than the flu affects ours.   Workers in China  are MORE THAN WILLING to work for $5/hr.   The calculation that must be made for American corporations is : What is the labor cost where bringing those jobs back here would be cost effective and profits will not be impacted?  I sincerely doubt we are anywhere near the point where it makes sense to bring jobs back.  The one thing that will most definitely happen as the virus spreads....immunity will follow.

It all works to their financial benefit. Indeed, coronavirus will be a boon to the healthcare profiteers who are sure to stay immune behind their gated communities, mansions in the sky and isolated yachts and private islands.

When asked how he could make a profit, he replied: ""Volume.""

Should the public actually hear Ross's words and react in horror at the Ebeneezer Scrooge (""then let them die ..."") sentiments, I imagine that the Administration will trot out Lawyer Dershowitz (and I really enjoyed ""Reversal of Fortune"") to argue that Ross said something completely different. The press, present paper included, will report that opinions differ about what was actually said on a live recording, as if Dershowitz were speaking a dialect of Esperanto for which there is no definitive lexicon.

I wonder how many people in the US who would have mindlessly pulled the R lever this coming November have been jolted into rethinking their position.

My second thought: it has been reported in the NYTimes that one of the reasons for the Corona virus's lack of containment is the nature of the Chinese dictatorship. It - Xi - are so concerned with maintaining control that Xi forbade the dissemination of information that could have led to containment for fear that it would indicate that his government is not fully in power.

At the moment we have no way of knowing whether the Trump administration's response is excessive or too little.  It LOOKS like the coronavirus is quite infectious, but it also looks like the death rate is small, around 2% for people infected.

Whether its the fact they burn 49% of the world's consumption of coal or their incredible addiction to plastic wrapping that ends up in waterways or human rights or international debt traps or the latest pandemic that has originated from China or financing US academics to steal intellectual property at its source or Huawei.

I am, like I assume is the case for most people, concerned first about the health threat of the corona virus. However, based on what I learned nearly 40 years ago, in some undergraduate classes, my second worry has been over the global economic impact of the coronavirus outbreak because of how globally interconnected manufacturing supply chains have become. So this is how abjectly incompetent William Ross is. He knows less about how manufacturing supply chains in today's global economy work than does a guy with a nearly 40 year old business degree. I would never apply for a job at any business involving any kind of oversight of manufacturing because I am not qualified. Wilbur Ross knows even less than me. Appointing someone that incompetent to Commerce Secretary should result in an additional article of impeachment. Trump's administration can only be described as a kakistocracy."
2020-01-31 15:59,"I may have missed the answer to this question: are Americans willing to trade an increase in manufacturing jobs for higher prices or, the corollary, are Americans willing to trade lower prices for lower wages/standard of living?  The administration wants to bring back manufacturing jobs but has no conception of the consequences because of the potential impact on prices and/or wages if they were to succeed."
2020-01-31 16:01,"This will be useful in educating the billionaire class, if they are educable, a debatable proposition. 

Wrapped in even more luxury by Trump's tax giveaway, they have not publicly criticized the seeds of recession planted by Trump.  Perhaps the immorality of Wilbur Ross's a pandemic in China is good for us will wake them up.  

At an rate, Bernie and the other Democratic candidates must  commit to renewed investment in pandemic prevention and mitigation.  Pandemics, like climate change, are a matter of national security, neglected by Trump."
2020-01-31 16:21,"Dr. Krugman:

With or without Coronavirus the manufacturing would be down, as the companies used the tax cuts to buy their own stock, distribute profits and activities unrelated to additional investment in production; by the way, you said that before."
2020-01-31 16:42,"It's always tough to accurately estimate the contagiousness of a new disease because the rate of contagion is number of cases at time 1 divided by the number of cases at time 0. Mathematically, as the denominator shrinks (fewer cases at time 0), the rate of spread grows. But at time 0, no one has seen the disease, it's very likely to be misdiagnosed, so the real number of cases can easily be much higher than the number reported, thus real rate of contagion much lower."

2020-01-31 16:53,"One of the oddest things about ""official"" US reaction to the coronavirus crisis is Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross's hypothesis that it will create more US jobs.

This claim seems to only further confirm that the US Secretary of Commerce has absolutely no understanding of global economics and corporate supply chains.

It is a fundamentally flawed analysis based on the erroneous and antiquated notion that American companies still source Chinese-produced goods from overseas American-owned plants.  That model doesn't exist anymore.

American manufactures for a long time now have relied on Chinese-owned manufacturers of parts and finished goods.  There are relatively few American-owned plants in China nowadays that somehow can be ""repatriated"".

If there is any likely result of an outflow of capital investment from China, it will be by Chinese manufacturers building plants elsewhere in Asia or, increasingly, in Africa from which they will supply their American and other Western buyers.

Our Secretary of Commerce should at least be wise enough to realize that the security concerns of allowing Huawei to construct 5G networks in the US and Europe arises because they produce the equipment and software using their own technology.  This fact alone should inform him that this is not the 1990's and we are no longer living in a world of ""runaway US plants"" operating in China that can somehow now be brought ""home""."

Our small village closed school, some businesses had to because everyone got ill, and life was miserable for those who did not get ill because they stayed away from us or helped us and put themselves in danger.
When I think of that time, and hear someone make remarks as this man has, I have great fear that if we have an epidemic, nothing will have changed from 1957."

I am more critical of Trump than Krugman could be on his most hateful day.  But ultra-partisan readers have filled these pages with opposition to a travel ban prohibiting every non-US citizen from entry to the US if they had been to China recently (and returning US citizens require to quarantine).  Your political/social agenda prevailed over your intelligence and your desire to prevent a very serious disease from afflicting Americans.  

And now that you have welcomed this virus to the US, Krugman has the nerve to find fault with Trump even though he did exactly as you wanted by his refusal to impose a travel ban and quarantine returning Americans.

Trump betrayed all Americans just like you wanted.  I suspect he did so in order to avoid losing the tourist business).  He betrayed all Americans just like your hero, Obama, betrayed all Americans by welcoming Ebola to the US by refusing to impose a travel ban then because, as he admitted then, he wanted to protect Africans from economic loss (which doesn't even make sense since there is no economic loss to Africa when Africans cannot make pleasure trips to the US)."
2020-01-31 16:40,"“Sure enough, Wilbur Ross, the commerce secretary, appeared on Fox Business on Thursday morning to declare that he “didn’t want to talk about a victory lap,” but that the coronavirus “will help to accelerate the return of jobs to North America.” By saying this, he demonstrated a couple of things: (1) why Gail Collins’s readers voted him Trump’s worst cabinet member, and (2) why Trump’s trade war has been such a failure.”

And how about:
3) What Wilbur Ross really means- “Sure humans will die from the coronavirus. But who cares? Isn’t our economy going to be great?!”

4) When the admiration of business overrides empathy (and sympathy) toward your fellow human beings it reminds me of this exchange between Scrooge and Marley in Dicken’s “A Christmas Carol:”

Scrooge: But you were always a good man of business, Jacob,' faltered Scrooge, who now began to apply this to himself.

Scientists Were Hunting for the Next Ebola. Now the U.S. Has Cut Off Their Funding.
Predict, a government research program, sought to identify animal viruses that might infect humans and to head off new pandemics.

Dennis Carroll, the former director of USAID’s emerging threats division who helped design Predict, oversaw it for a decade and retired when it was shut down. The surveillance project is closing because of “the ascension of risk-averse bureaucrats,” he said.

Because USAID’s chief mission is economic aid, he added, some federal officials felt uncomfortable funding cutting-edge science like tracking exotic pathogens.

Congress, along with the administrations of George W. Bush and Barack Obama, were “enormously supportive,” said Dr. Carroll, who is now a fellow at Texas A&M’s Bush School of Government and Public Service.

Of course, these two industries are in a natural decline, but he has accelerated the decline. The issue, as with everything with Trump, goes to the issue of trust.

What's scarier to imagine is how the Trump administration might react during a full-blown pandemic and its aftermath.  Imagine getting your pandemic news via presidential tweet.  Imagine Trump disagreeing with CDC and other leading scientists and his own scientific and disaster-relief advisors.  Imagine what enemies Trump might identify as responsible for illness and deaths, e.g., immigrants, China, and what actions he would take against them.  Imagine what actions his administration might take so it looks like it's doing something, e.g., close hospitals to immigrants, launch investigations of political scapegoats, investigate university science departments, etc.  Imagine how the administration would impose a news blackout to ""prevent panic"".

In fact depending on the severity of the Coronaviris Chinese imports of U.S. products may fall.

The Chinese have been building at an unprecedented rate and this has poured money into economies around the world.  Germany's economy, for example, has been strengthened by its exports of machinery to China with consequential benefit to the economy of Europe as a whole.  Would a contraction of the Chinese economy, in part by over-building and possibly as a result of the coronavirus, lead to the recession we've all been waiting for?  I'd like Mr. Krugman's opinion on this."

Hand washing is your first line of defense. Look up isolation precautions levels. 
Look up types of respirator masks that will prevent inhalation of virus and biohazards. 
Stay out of public places unless you must go to work / school. If symptomatic call your healthcare provider. 
At this point I don’t think we have an antiviral medicine that is being administered to general public anywhere. 
For fever/ chills take acetominiphen
Every 4 to 8 hours. Max. Dose in 24 hours no more than 1500 to 3000mg. In doses of 500mg. Tablets . Discuss dosing with your pharmacist. This drug can damage your kidneys and livers if taken long term in high dosing. 
For nausea get a script for Compazine suppositories or a script for Zofran brand antiemetic which is used for chemo nausea. Again ask your doc and pharmacists about it’s dosing etc. 
Stay hydrated with fizzy waters. Ice chips. There is a two week incubation period for illness to express itself. In other words you may be infected and infecting others without knowing u are ill yet. 
This is serious and measures to protect yourself and family should be your priority. 
Call your Senators and Reps. Express dismay.

War against Wuhan Corona virus (WCV) will go in full swing not that the sleeping giant China has been awakened and taking the right steps. China will shovel not the just the grounds to build its infrastructure of hospitals for isolation and treatment but will shovel billions to combat the Corona virus. The battle of the dragon against the electron microscopic Corona virus will only be won by the economic might of China ready to eradicate WCV by all means possible. 

As a Virologist I strongly feel that the eradication of the WCV from the face of the earth at all cost is possible within 6 months if there is a global investment not just of money but a multi pronged strategic approach by effectively deploying the currently available broad spectrum antivirals that are present in all continents except Antarctica. I am referring to the potent broad spectrum antivirals against enveloped viruses from pomegranates that I have with my own hands shown to be potentially capable of giving any person exposed to the deadly enveloped virus like the WCV to have a fighting chance to mount an effective immune response to clear the virus. 

With the signing of big bipartisan trade deals in recent days, the commerce secretary has hardly flunked any test. Only an arm chair economist would have ample time on his hands to say that"

It's the same callous mentality that doesn't connect the effects of Climate Change on immigration, migration and world poverty that leads to graft and corruption world wide. 

It's the same selfish mentality that decides to give farm aid to Corporate Farmers, leaving out the small farmers and putting tariffs  on soy and corn, thus making it even more impossible for small business to thrive in America.  
And then cutting regulations on coal and oil production to make our citizens sick with lead, chemicals and thereby, increase the need for health care, which he would like to put back in the hands of Big Pharma and Private Insurance.

This kind of a view is fairly common.

What is overlooked is that often the same people will claim  we should coddle the rich because the rewards trickle down.  That's false, according to their own mind set.  Which is, for the rich to succeed, everyone else must fail.

2020-01-30 22:45,"I live about 20 miles from Wax-Mart headquarters. They like the cheap good from China, and Americans like them, too. We're not too concerned about whether China puts Muslims in prison or whether they have any human freedoms/rights, and we don't really care if the Waltons have over $100 billion while most of us move downward on the standard-of-living, quality-of-life scale. Nah, we're kinda less than interested.

Americans are bad at citizenship. We'd like to think differently, but as an old high school US Government teacher, I can assure you, we are not good citizens. Good citizens really need to be aware and informed on so many issues. It's not an easy task. Maybe that's why most of the founding fathers didn't trust democracy, including installing the electoral college to make sure one-person, one-vote wasn't really real. 

To talk about economics in the same breath as people dying from a disease is incredibly immoral. Trump is incredibly immoral. And, if we continue to look to him as leader and guide, we too are. Too sad for words.

The Republican argument that a President can do anything if 'he' thinks its in the national interest is a crime against humanity. It is a crime against democracy and truth. It is a crime against the very soul of America. 

There is a great and destructive sickness going around this world. It is a virus of greed and selfish acquisition aligned with apathy and disinterest. We'll see what we're really made of. We're on the precipice. Our move."
2020-01-31 19:54,I've thought since 2016 that it would take an economic crisis to dislodge Trump. Now I'm sure of it. So maybe the silver lining here is that there is such a crisis on the horizon. The fly in the silver lining however is that Trump has a ready-at-hand excuse-- coronavirus.

The announcement from Mr. Ross -- who settled a lawsuit filed by his former law partner for ?$9 million for funds he pilfered from that partner -- appointed by a world-renowned con man in the Oval Office, is DISGUSTING. 

The USA once helped nations in their national stresses.  We now see an economic killing to be made if we pounce on it now.  APPALLING.  MORTIFYING.  I know why friends who travel identify themselves as Canadians, when asked."

  Ethan went on the Web and did his OWN research & saw the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) confirmed NO link between Vaccines and Autism.  Ethan got vaccinated in early 2019, at age 18.

   Ethan's own parents, especially his Mother, still do not agree with his decision.  But he never questioned her as a Parent.  He said: ""I question her sources.  Misinformed people are not evil, but misinformation till isn't OK"".

    The most egregious example of the War on Science, is Climate Change Denial.  
     Oceanic Acidification, lowering the Ph of the Oceans from 8.1 to a projected 7.85, makes the Oceans more Acidic, threatening we eat, like Clams.  Soon, there may only be Jellyfish in the Ocean.  They tell me Jellyfish are tasty on a Cracker, but I am in no rush to try that.

     Oceanic Oxygen Depletion also threatens us, as a Nov 2015 article in ""The Bulletin of Mathematical Biology"" pointed out.  The warmer ocean threatens Plankton that makes 66%+ of our Oxygen.

Will underinsured or uninsured Americans visit a doctor when they feel unwell? Will those who end up in the hospital (many of the patients in China require around the clock ICU care) emerge bankrupt?

It's clearly spread to a number of other countries, but even now sum total cases outside of China remain less than 2% of the total.  This suggests both the primacy of a non-human source within China, and the absence of significant person-to-person transmission.

I think the anti vaxxers on line are mad but as someone who writes about the philosophy of science I think modern medicine needs an epistemological rethink from the ground up to be more about what is scientifically workable and sustainable and less about creating markets for chemicals that started in C19th Europe.

I'm reasonably confident that diligent public health procedures will prevent this disease from becoming epidemic in the US, but there is no absolute certainty of that, or that another disease, more lethal and contagious, will leap across the firebreak. Or absence of a firebreak, really, since the problem is that we don't have one."

No country could have managed to do better with a corona virus because no country outside of China has had such a problem. 

The world must understand that pathogenic viruses will arise in human populations from time to time and especially where there is species contact with animals able to carry viruses. All human viruses arose from other species and human DNA carries the signatures of viruses from long ago. Humans cannot escape viral existence. What we can hope for is to limit and control the outbreaks of new types of viral organisms which have pathogenic aspects for humans."

A strong central government that can enact and enforce a vast quarantine can surely find the means to police and inspect its food supply in these meat and wildlife open markets-before these diseases take root. 

By the way, I love Chinese food and culture. But this outbreak and previously SARS indicate that the government there needs to bring food handling laws and standards way up."

""Trump's unwarranted distrust in science and institutions could be a major problem if the outbreak worsens""

It is counterproductive to insinuate, even if unintentional, that science bears any responsibility in the incompetence of governments that result in further spreading of highly contagious diseases. Science, particularly under this administration, is already getting a bad wrap based on  disinformation for political power and profit. It is sad that our scientific institutions have to devote precious resources to defend themselves against baseless accusations and general public indifference. Our once highly vaunted scientific institutions, the envy of the world, are being challenged by foreign entities on many fronts, and yet each year since his election President Trump has submitted budget proposals that severely cut funding for nearly all federal science agencies. Only the temporary will of Congress has countered these disastrous cuts and modestly raised science funding. And these modest actions are taken at some of the best economic and productive times in recent memory. I dread to contemplate an economic slowdown under this or similar administration at a time when we face the threat of climate change and reversal of decades-old environmental gains. Even casually hinting that science may be a problem will just stir further resentment at a time we need the resources and aspiring new talent to solve the problems facing humanity."

I hope government officials here in the States, around the world, and in major cities such as New York are working on ways to quell potential public panic if this continues to spread. 
In my opinion, there would need to be a concerted joint effort by major media such as the Times, public and private institutions and governments, to quell public anxiety if this continues to spread. I think that mitigating potential panic is almost as important as developing a cure."

Is it due to the Chinese penchant of food and culinary (specially non-veg.) experimentation that brings closer human-animal/bird contact, or as the conspiracy theories suggest, it is China's global power obsession that forces it to embrace the biological weapon development with the fallout like the  uncontrolled virus epidemics?"

I think it’s failing with this virus too.  It’s messages to the public are confusing and do not reflect the seriousness (and the small window for containment). While public health measures may create inconvenience for some people, it’s nothing compared to an epidemic. The Chinese government acted faster than for SARS, but took a month to raise the alarm and really start trying to contain the virus.  It’s no wonder people are losing faith in institutions."

Trump is scientifically illiterate and that willful ignorance encompasses the field of medicine. His varying pronouncements over the years  about the necessity of childhood vaccinations,  have never had anything to do with science, but everything to do with politics. I fervently hope that with the informed advice from the CDC we are able to stop the spread of the coronavirus, but Donald Trump saying that “the outbreak is totally under control” wouldn’t reassure me one iota - especially if he has a Sharpie at hand."

The 4500 proven cases are those are sick enough to tolerate waiting in line at a Wuhan hospital, or who are seriously ill enough to get emergency services.  There are probably tens or hundreds of thousands of other cases going under the radar.  

Interestingly, a planeload of 200 Japanese evacuees arrive in Japan yesterday, all were tested for the virus, and of those 3 were detected to have the virus.  Only 1 of them showed symptoms, and the other 2 showed no symptoms.  If the population of Wuhan infected at that same rate, that would be 150,000 cases (out of 10 million population).  If death rate were 150, that would be 1/10 of a percent.  

There are still many unknowns, but I predict that within a month or two the majority of Wuhan will have developed resistance, spreading the slow of new cases in Wuhan, followed similarly by the rest of of China in 3 months, and the USA in 6 to 9 months (will the election be postponed?).  

There is really no quarantine policy that can  slow the spread that wouldn't result in even more deaths from a breakdown in services and supply lines - which depend upon international trade.  Vaccines won't be fast enough this time, but we that might improve in future outbreaks - better to focus on vaccines than spread unfocused panic."

2020-01-30 9:43,"As far as distrust in science is concerned, there is ample reason to be extremely wary of the Chinese scientific and medical institutions and their professional and ethical standards of conduct.

This outbreak comes on the heels of a major recent scandal involving human experimentation by Chinese researchers using genomic modification (CRISPR-Cas9) in an attempt to suppress vertical HIV transmission - a non-existent problem in China, but one the Chinese state bears considerable financial exposure to in their African client states.

One therefore has to wonder what other covert virology research programs are underway, especially involving the same family of coronaviruses responsible for the earlier SARS outbreak.

If this novel virus -- never before seen in nature -- had in fact jumped from an animal host to humans, one would have expected to see a more dispersed initial pattern of spread. The single point source identified - one local live animal market - seems suspect. 

It is more likely that a spatial cluster of multiple such markets within the region would have served as entry vectors, and that one also would find sporadic cases within the rural population living in proximity to the reservoir species.

On the other hand, a single virology research lab seems like a more plausible point source, if that is in fact the actual epidemiological pattern here, and the ensuing lockdown would make far more sense as a containment protocol."
2020-01-30 9:47,"We will know in a couple of weeks as to the real mortality rate of the illness as the 14 day incubation period runs its course.  My suspicion is that we have gotten lucky in regards to the mortality rate.  Distrust of institutions runs deep not just in the USA.

Because the point of evolutionary fit DNA biological natural selection survival is to leave the most best adapted offspring over time and space. 

Running ahead of our vaccines and antibiotics and medical paraphernalia is a constant struggle. Becoming a natural part of our biotic regime from birth to death is their ultimate victory."

For sure once we learned this virus can be transmitted by asymptomatic people we needed to have rethought this. 

Do we have a policy for those returning to the US from China? I know Middlebury College in VT has students in China that they are planning on bringing back to VT; will they be quarantined?  Or are they just going to have their temps taken and told to stay in their rooms, wink wink.?

We're not getting a lot of info here in the US. While I don't want to see sensationalist coverage and fear mongering, we do need the facts. Some are just discounting this virus as so many get the flu and the death rate from that is high. But they are forgetting that there is a vaccine for the flu one can obtain. In addition, the mortality rate for the Wuhan virus appears to be much higher than for the flu. If people don't know the facts they will underestimate it which is also an issue. 

As for masks, I don't think it's a bad thing at all to acquire masks but one needs to know what type, how/when to use them and what number is reasonable vs hoarding."
2020-01-30 11:25,"As someone stated earlier,  those numbers seem scary until you consider the flu season we experience in the U.S. every year. For the 2019-2020 flu season to date, the CDC reports 140,000 flu-related hospitalizations and 8,200 deaths. Millions more flu cases did not result in hospitalization or death. And this flu seasons is about average compared to the last 10 years.  Coronavirus news might sound scary, but the flu season we experience every year is many times worse.  

The media is blowing this WAY out of proportion."
2020-01-30 11:34,"What comes to mind for me here is that in any emergency/unknown situation trust in the government, trust in the information provided and action taken are vital. Problem one is that has been lost here at home and in most of the world. My second take on this is that science/health care/prevention and education are very important than ever before because of the very rapidly changing world we live in. Problem two is we are cutting back and mocking this at least here in the US."
2020-01-30 11:40,"Of course we are not ready and we will never because we refuse to make tough decision when something like happens,
We have a press who to focus on hype and sensation, world health organisation that wait to long to act but what worst if we know nothing about this but allow people to travel freely, is doing a quick scan at the airport an answer NO,  put anyone who arrived from these areas in quarantine, so what a few people lose their rights for a couple weeks, better then the rest of us dying from them.

People rush to buy medical supplies they may not need or worst they do not know how to wear a mask correctly, kind of defeats the purpose of wearing a  mask if you have it on wrong"
2020-01-30 12:05,"The world is ignoring this at its peril. The comparison to to influenza is a fallacy and ignores the seriousness of this epidemic.  Yes millions get the flu but it has only a 0.1% mortality, compared to 2% for corona virus by current analysis. That is 200 times as deadly....also up to 20% of victims have severe respiratory issues, far greater than for influenza. The number of institutions maintaining that we should be more concerned about influenza are ignoring the porous nature of borders once this becomes a worldwide phenomenon."
2020-01-30 12:32,"We need to worry. In a world of global climate change there should be some concern. What about changes to the animal kingdom that affects interactions with humans? Lyme Disease is one example. Rising rates of frightening mosquito born viruses are another.  Will a warmer planet increase rates of mutation? Scientists talk about pathogens ""jumping from animal to human species"" but how has climate change caused this calamity? We cause our politics. Climate change will affect any virus, any vector, and in the end, we must pay attention."
2020-01-30 12:43,"I realize that almost every article in the NYT, especially the opinion pieces, is supposed to bash Trump for whatever he does or do not do in any given situation.

If it is possible to set politics aside for just a moment, please consider what individuals can do about the coronavirus outbreak.

Using face masks can fill two important functions: 

1. They generally reduce the number of virus particles one inhales, not by 100%, but by a meaningful amount. 

2. Masks also reduce the number of virus particles expelled by infected persons when they cough or sneeze, not by 100% but by a meaningful amount. This is why you see pictures of infected patients wearing masks even in isolation wards, to reduce the chances they will infect others. 

Thought for the day: If you are on a plane or train or subway and your seatmate starts sneezing or coughing, put on your own face mask and offer your seatmate one, too. 

Due to the coronavirus outbreak I have started carrying several masks with me when I travel in order to deal with just such eventualities. 

And, while washing one's hands frequently with soap and water is a good idea, it isn't always feasible, so be sure to carry hand sanitizer in the pocket/purse size bottles or in those tiny packets that are even smaller."
2020-01-30 13:09,"I believe the federal government would respond to a serious epidemic. However, under the Trump administration, I'm concerned the response would be asymmetrical. As we've seen before, Trump constantly seeks to reward loyalists and punish dissenters. This is the story of disaster relief in the Trump era. Even rules for climate mitigation are designed to exclude non-Trump states. California is begrudgingly receiving funds only because the Trump administration couldn't find a way to exclude them.

This is how I suspect coronavirus would play out in our present moment. If the outbreak occurred in Texas, state officials would receive fawning attention and limitless funds. If the outbreak occurred in California, the response would be late, reluctant, and inadequate. Hurricane Harvey versus Hurricane Maria. And of course, universally dishonest throughout. ""Best disease response ever,"" as people die in unnecessary numbers. That's what I expect from our federal government right now.

Fortunately, I live in a state with robust health services and strong public support. I'm relying on local government in an emergency, not Trump. Putting your life in Trump's hands seems about as smart as sticking your hand in a blender. I trust that man in an emergency less than I trust board walk bottle games. I seriously hope some else is in charge when disaster strikes."
2020-01-30 13:14,"I understand the new  Coronavirus has yet to be formally named according to reports. How about calling it the Trump Disease? His symptoms spread pretty fast. I can't imagine how many people are truly emotionally suffering the last three years and now this? 

Besides the predictable preceding writing, there is the fact of people's concern. I'm reading about it here and I don't watch the sensational television. I'm cool as can be. I bought a few boxes of masks to share, bar soap, and hand sanitizers, and I'm not panicking at all. I'm simply being prepared, and you should know that the mask hording could be doctors offices as well, and I plan on sharing my masks with neighbors and my doctors office. Relax about what you refer to as a panic. It puts demands on manufacturing who recognize the need, can estimate needed production requirements, and figure in production lead times and distribution times and they will meet demand, a necessary function. So any panic will actually better prepare the public. I have 250 regular masks and some N95 NIOSH masks for myself I've gathered since a serious illness last Spring. I plan on sharing my ""Horded"" masks. That's why I bought so many, because there are always more people unprepared."

Lord only knows how mankind will survive this new virus."
2020-01-30 13:23,"This is a pandemic.

It is appearing all over the world.

Many countries and commercial enterprises are halting operations with and in China.

Russia just announced a border closure.

The Chinese economy is being destroyed.

The Chinese Communist Party, which attempted to cover all this up and deny and stonewall, is now under the gun.

What millions of people who tried to bring democracy to China could not accomplish a virus will.

This is the end of China as we knew it."
2020-01-30 13:52,"Plague maps throughout history show similar patterns.  Seemingly healthy people flee the infectious area, taking the disease with them to infect new populations.  We've added air travel and fast trains to the mix, so the spread can happen faster and further.  Something like this seems inevitable, this time, next time, etc.  Maybe it takes the die-off of 2% of the world population to convince us all that we're on a tiny livable speck - together - in the middle of a vast universe."

2020-01-30 13:56,"One of the fears surrounding the threat of this Coronavirus is that it is new and its potential impact is yet unknown.

Lack in familiarity with this particular virus plays a large part in our fears. Such is not the case with the Seasonal Influenza virus which affects bout a billion people per year and can account for deaths in the vicinity 650,000 yearly.

A pandemic is the worldwide spread of a new disease. Influenza is a yearly pandemic of an old disease and therefore does not raise the fears a new one does. It is so familiar to many that they don't even bother to get vaccinated for it."
2020-01-30 14:04,"China's wild meat markets should have been permanently closed. Of course, there would have been illicit trade but perhaps not in congested settings. Illicit trade would make  it hard to source viral appearances but perhaps not.  Chinese researchers had already identified this virus in bats and found people with antibodies.

Ultimately, there will be a pandemic in part because of excessive human population density."
2020-01-30 14:05,"Unfortunately ""the world"" is a very big place that a pandemic makes small remarkably quickly. The question ""is the world ready"" is clearly rhetorical.   

If Trump said the virus is under total control in our country, I'd be very, very concerned since he is ordinarily under-informed and generally dishonest. Only someone who routinely neglects details communicates judgements of that type. He's exactly the type of leader one does not want in a real crisis."
2020-01-30 14:27,"Global warming has only a tangential effect on the prevalence and spread of disease. A warmer earth provides a hospitable environment for harboring and maintaining all organisms. An epidemic and its worst case outcome, a pandemic, is preventable through open, honest and concerned scientific communications between nations. These latter points are obviated by the leadership in principal countries such as the US and China who are vying for economic and political dominance. We, the world population, is at constant risk with the likes of Trump and Xi at the respective helms of their ships of state."
2020-01-30 14:40,"There are a lot of commenters here with no apparent expertise in the medical field who are bandying about statistics concerning the transmission rate of the corona virus. Supposedly, the Coronavirus is twice as infectious as the flu (another corona virus). The fact is that no one knows for sure how infectious this new virus is. 

The one thing we do know is that it attacks the respiratory system and kills the old and immunologically compromised. The 1918 pandemic killed young healthy people, which is why it was so deadly. It almost killed my 2 year old father. 

So, we don’t know how infectious this virus is, but we do know that like the flu, the only people who will die from it are the old and people whose immune systems have been suppressed. 

There is no need to panic. I remember the Swine Flu panic. Millions of dollars were spent for nothing. SARS only killed 800 people. This is not the 1918 flu. The press has an obligation not to contribute to hysteria, but stories about new viruses sell."
2020-01-30 14:45,"if this new strain of coronavirus cannot be contained in China and somehow moves into the U.S. population, the dire consequences of prioritizing multinational corporations over people will be laid bare. 

this country is led by a political party which has worked to a) slash health investment, from personal healthcare to healthcare research; b) foment public distrust of science and medicine for its own gain; c) alienated and punished the urban centers which have the highest population density; d) isolated the U.S. from its allies and weakened the UN and other global bodies; e) used lies, deceit and hyper partisanship to score political points and maintain power. 

given all of the above, i cannot imagine a president or a political party less prepared to deal with a potential global pandemic if it arrives. god help us."

I disagree that there is distrust in science and institution. There is unjustified panic because how fast the outbreak is spreading. Scientists are not gods and no previous Corona virus infection does accurately mirror the current WCV. 

There are a lot of unknowns right now and partly because the isolated virus from patients for study. There is a report from Australia from the Nobel laureate Peter Doherty Institute of Infectious Diseases in Melbourne, has a WCV  in the laboratory. If the virus is made available for research by others who have the appropriate BSL 4 facilities and antiviral candidate to test for treatment against WCV. 

The Edi board should not jump to conclusions like distrust of Science. Give Scientists especially virologists a chance to play a role in eradicating the WHC. C has plenty of public health officials and medically trained personnel but considering that C had recently a swine virus that wiped out 1000s of pigs and now this. There is a global shortage of Veterinary and human Virologists and that is a primary reason why the WCV infections will get worse before it gets better. Those of us who know how viruses jump across species will tell you they are often too clever for human comprehension."

How about no Chinese goods coming into our country and how about no flights  coming in from anywhere in China and no flights going into anywhere in China.   We cannot, nor should we risk the health and welfare of our citizens.  Don't let trump get away with calling this a slight cold the way he dismissed our servicemen suffering brain damage as just a headache."
2020-01-30 15:04,"@Sari - The problem is that with ""no Chinese goods coming into our country,"" we will quickly start running out of a great many things. We are far too interconnected with the rest of the world for this type of isolation to be possible. 

For instance, as just one example, there are some critical drugs that, even if made in the U.S., rely on ingredients that are only produced by one or two factories in India or China. Shut off the supply lines and our ability to make those drugs disappears. 

Globalization has made us far too vulnerable. Every aspect of our lives relies on the global machine running smoothly. The disruption and domino effect from suddenly shutting down China's part in that would likely be as bad, if not worse, than the coronoavirus itself."

On top of that, we have the discrediting of our science community for the sole purpose of massaging the president's ego, and massive cuts to science and research.
It's not use raising the alarm when it seems to fall on so many deaf ears."

Viruses are a potent component of the arsenal and we have seen their ravages for as long as humans have existed.  In our instant-gratification age where we pomp ourselves overmuch about how extraordinary our medical knowledge is, we see the shabby reality of our beliefs and will face our demise, individually and as a race, with a rather poor ability to acquiesce to death."
2020-01-30 2:33,"“The Chinese market at the center of the deadly coronavirus outbreak sold live animals — including wolf pups, foxes, rats and peacocks — to eat.  Other wildlife sold at the market included crocodiles, giant salamanders, snakes, porcupines and camel meat. The wild animals were among 112 items that were peddled at the Huanan Seafood Market in the central city of Wuhan,. “Freshly slaughtered, frozen and delivered to your door,” said the price list for the vendor, “Wild Game Animal Husbandry for the Masses.”

Hindus and Buddhists strongly believe Karma  “word meaning the result of a person's actions as well as the actions themselves. It is a term about the cycle of cause and effect. According to the theory of Karma, what happens to a person happens because they caused it with their actions”.

All of our actions, including our choice of food, have Karmic consequences. By involving oneself in the cycle of inflicting injury, pain and death, even indirectly by eating other creatures, one must in the future experience in equal measure the suffering caused."
2020-01-30 5:37,"""Distrust in science and institutions"". Not really. It's more ""distrust in institutions"" particularly, the governing class and its attendant media. Most people are fine with ""hard"" science.  The distrust of institutions and attendant media comes from observation of how the ""preferred narratives"" of these ""institutions"" evidently impact the interpretation of the ""science"" their attendant media attempts to get the general public to swallow.  See Iraq War, Afghan War Libyan intervention, African military presence etc... domestic news coverage of the 2008 financial crisis added to recent  coverage of institutionally preferred political candidates presented like unappetizing must eat vegetables before unruly children. ""No socialist candidates for you!""  All this has made it pretty clear on most days and most subjects the US media serves its role as ""mouthpiece"" of America's establishment as well as China's People's Daily serves its own. 
In the case of the ""mysterious"" corona virus suspicion of US media reports and analysis produced have to be read with an eye to the US media tendency to use any China news (and that news is certainly carefully selected) to score cheap points in the ""systems competition"" the NYT and several other US media outlets have several times proclaimed the US is in with China.
In fact, it's hard to disentangle the US coverage of the crisis from its need to constantly hammer China.
So. Yes. Uphill road ahead for the ""institutions""."
2020-01-30 3:15,"China should have put Wuhan under quarantine weeks ago, but they waited too long, till the virus spread to all their major cities. The reason for the delay, wishful thinking and fear of social and economic disruption. Now the virus is being transmitted from person to person in all Chinese provinces.

The rest of the world should be putting China under quarantine. That will limit further spread of this infection and give us a much better chance of containing it. No one in, no one out without a strict two to four week quarantine. But of course this will not be done. Every one knows that money is more important than lives. A potential death toll in the millions is unlikely but still possible, and governments bury their heads in the sand."

But the Chinese (Communists) have historically - and with this healthcare crisis - suppressed information and made it more difficult for doctors and hospitals to share information and control the spread of SARS, and now this new Coronavirus epidemic. Their motive? Money! Trade. Tourism. (Sound familiar?)

And, meanwhile back in the jungle...this is when a functional national healthcare system in the US - infrastructure, medical training,  affordable (not rip-off) healthcare - might come in handy.

Trump and his GOP stalwarts would have us dismantle all of it, turn it over to ignorant and dividend-crazy investors putting their money into corporations run precisely to return ""value"" to those selfsame investors. Lives like my spouses are so much collateral damage in such a blind system, since her life or death would be immaterial to the bank accounts at issue.

The coronavirus outbreak has the attention of the investors now, of course, since a worldwide plague would not be especially nice to the global economy (We know just how much the stock market dipped, down to the hundredths, while the names of the dead are known only to their grieving families.)

Trump, a leader with subzero credibility, has gotten out his sharpie and scribbled that everything is under control, by which he means, ""vote for me."" No help coming from that quarter.

We're all in big trouble, but not nearly so much as the sick, injured, and vulnerable among us should the libertarian fever dream of a neutered government serving only money and those who possess it. Thank God my wife got help in time."

Whenever animals are crowded problems develop. Evironmental degradation, disease, food shortages, fighting, etc.

We can accomplish this over a few decades using some proven methods. First, educate women. This leads to fewer births and healthier children. We now have excellent birth control so people can still enjoy intimate love relations. Etc.

2020-01-30 2:33,"The administration deserves zero credit for the infectious disease experts at CDC.  Ninety-nine percent of these are career scientists who are devoted to protecting the public's health.  They do so in spite of the Trump administration, and not because of the administration."
2020-01-30 3:26,"There are more than 27 million Americans who have no health insurance and millions more who are underinsured. It used to be about 45 million before the ACA. 

A single night in a hospital observation unit can cost over $10,000, and that's not including doctors' fees and the cost of tests. So these people are incentivized to tough it until they become quite ill. In the meantime, if they are infected, they're spreading bacteria or viruses to the people they come in contact with. Which could be you or me.

To halt or at least slow an epidemic, people who are infectious need to be detected as early as possible and quarantined. Just as vaccination provides herd immunity, a medical system that allows everyone to seek care when they first develop symptoms would protect all of us, not just the people seeking care. 

The rapid movement of people made possible by air travel, the declining effectiveness of antibiotics, and the increased likelihood of the spread of tropical diseases because of the climate crisis, all argue for a medical system that doesn't leave anyone out in the cold.

When Medicare for All is criticized as being too expensive, I doubt that the costs of expanding the reach of an epidemic are being taken into account."

They would tell you that hysteria always walks hand in hand with epidemics. They would remind people of that scene, in Huckleberry Finn, when fear of contagion supersedes compassion (read the comments, most of us are no Huck Finns). Certainly, they would suggest we reread Camus, whose description of a plague epidemic quite fits the times. Also, they'd remind us of Shakespeare, and poetry."
2020-01-30 15:29,"I'm always happy to see the international community jump to work on problems like this. Despite a faltering start, hopefully this will lead to a quick containment of the problem.

It is sad that the United States can not equally apply itself to the tens of thousands of injuries and deaths each year that are due to acute lead poisoning, a situation that face masks, hand washing and even condoms cannot seem to halt."
2020-01-30 15:39,"The US public have never accepted the scientific viewpoint as religion usually gets in the way. 10 years of data shows that over 4 in 10 Americans think the planet is less than 10 000 years old. Hard to credit of course, but it also shows how desperately poor, and uncritical,  public education is. How can such people possibly understand the cause and spread of viruses? If this gets a hold its going to be a bumpy ride."
2020-01-30 15:47,"Now Trump seems also to be made accountable for the coronavirus spread? I don’t like him at all, but Trump doesn’t hold the communication monopoly in USA! So, he might try to keep the information for himself, or to make it look positive when it isn’t, but there are other institutions responsible for warning and protecting the Americans. Not everything’s going through Trump."
2020-01-30 16:01,"Why is all the media avoiding the elephant in the room?  If the virus can be transmitted by those that have it but are unaware they have it, then it can not, repeat NOT, be controlled until a vaccine can be developed for it.  Look for a geometric increase in the number of infections.  And pray you don't get it."
2020-01-30 16:12,"I know the coronavirus is ""news"", but seriously, more than 8,000 people have died in the US alone during this current influenza season, for which there is a readily available vaccine that is substantially effective. We are worrying about the wrong thing. Fearmongering."
2020-01-30 16:19,"Some of the commenters sound like Greta Thunberg, urging us to eschew plane travel and take buses or trains. Last time I looked it is impossible to get from NYC to London or Paris or New Delhi or anywhere outside North and South America by train or bus. Who knew? Pretty much everyone, I think.

Also, if international flights are significantly curtailed that will mean disaster for travel- and tourism-related businesses and major attractions around the world, leading to significant shrinking of the economies of the cities and countries where the attractions are located.

Significant reductions in flights would also make it very difficult for companies to manage foreign subsidiaries or offices and conduct normal business relationships, another recipe for financial constriction.

Video-conferencing can do only so much, and would not really solve the problems noted above.

The answer is not to curtail plane flights, but to make their engines more efficient and less polluting."
2020-01-30 16:27,"Some commentators here have noted that Trump is “anti-science”. He’s not. It's worse than that. Let me explain why.

Anti-science suggests that he has a particular position against or opinion about scientific matters. He doesn’t even have that. He’s largely uninterested in (or incapable of) forming an opinion in such matters. That would require some minimum level of intellectual ability or epistemological foundation.

2020-01-30 17:01,"One of the research teams calculated that in its early stages, the epidemic doubled in size every 7.4 days. That measure, called the epidemic’s “serial interval,” reflects the average span of time that elapses from the appearance of symptoms in one infected person to the appearance of symptoms in the people he will go on to infect. In the early stages of the outbreak, each infected person who became ill is estimated to have infected 2.2 others, according to the study in the New England Journal of Medicine.

But, having witnessed the blatant corruption of many American institutions by so many horrific Trump appointees,

Well, I’d say you are lucky then that it wasn’t confined to the elderly or it would have taken much longer to identify its virility among humans. I vividly recall how long it took for medical scientists and U.S. society in general to recognize that HIV was not an act of a jealous god.

“But global health experts say that over all, the country’s response still leaves much to be desired.”

There is not much we can do in the short-term about overpopulation but wait for natural population control events, such as widespread famine and war, to save us. Water under the bridge.

Globalization results from conscious choices made by politicians and the captains of industry in the last third of the 20th century to emphasize short-term profit over sustainable human welfare. Because it has brought higher standards of living to much - but not all - of what we used to call the 3rd World and has led to the exponential growth of stock markets and wealth disparity in the developed world, there will be much resistance among the wealthy and powerful to walking it back, though a few feasible limits on worldwide trade and travel might not ruin our lives.

Germs have an alarming way of piling on to a sick human.  For ex., roughly 30,000 Americans die yearly of the flu.  But they don't typically die of the flu virus itself--they die of a bacterial pneumonia that follows the flu.  Their immunity has been driven low so that any onboard germs may multiply; their nasal passages & lungs provide goopy environments congenial to new germs.

This corona virus may supply the same circumstances.  So have you gotten your pneumonia vaccination yet?  (And of course, your flu vac?)  Here's the CDC guidelines.  Your insurance, will likely cover it.  And for Pete's sake, if you have or suspect any chronic conditions, get this done--and soon enough for the vac's immunity to take effect!

CDC website:
""Vaccines help prevent pneumococcal disease, which is any type of illness caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae bacteria. There are two kinds of pneumococcal vaccines available in the United States:

Pneumococcal conjugate vaccine or PCV13
Pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine or PPSV23
CDC recommends PCV13 for all children younger than 2 years old & people 2 years or older with certain medical conditions. 

CDC recommends PPSV23 for all adults 65 years or older, people 2 through 64 years old with certain medical conditions, & adults 19-64 years old who smoke cigarettes."""

Then there was chortling about how right these armchair experts were when ""no one died"" (other than the 774 who did, of course). 

We were to take their word for it. The WHO & CDC were the deep state intent on making a ""mountain out of a molehill"" just to ""inconvenience"" all of us and make money (?). These were not outliers...there were hundreds of posts to this effect.

It doesn't seem to have dawned on these posters that the only reason SARS was not more deadly was precisely because of the precautions taken. I'd hazard a guess that these helpful warriors would be the first to scream bloody murder if it was one of their loved ones who died or if a true pandemic broke out, even though they'd be the same refusing to take the precautions, get vaccinated, or abide by instructions designed to keep everyone safe.

The school I was in also had a crazy policy about head lice, where kids could stay at school if they had nits in their hair. It was so gross. Obviously, when kids chronically have nits in their hair, we’re not dealing with people with good hygiene practices. The germs in this school just about killed me. That coupled with anti-vaxers made the environment one where people were always sick. Teachers and kids alike were often sick. It was maddening to not be able to make it through a week without getting coughed on, etc.  I realized I could not remain in an elementary school environment after that year due to my health concerns, but it’s not just a problem for people with weak immune systems.

Hospitals are especially dangerous as sepsis accounts for 30% of in-patient deaths, as well as, 30% of the institutional costs.  Soon, elective surgery will be performed only on deserted islands after a two week quarantine period.  This particular virus is as tricky as Nixon was and certainly as deceptive as Trump (asymptomatic incubation phase with contagion).  Hand washing two hundred times a day with lye soap might help but otherwise stay away from crowded football stadiums and anywhere the idea of zoonosis seems plausible. No bat or alligator snuggling. Seriously though, everyone needs to be hand washing freaks and stop using dish towels to wipe your face."

China should have followed scientific advice and completely re-engineered the structure of its meat markets to isolate them from known dangerous sources of infection after the SARS debacle.

They did not. Therefore history repeats. It’s that simple.

One hundred years from now, surviving human beings will curse the generations alive today for not following scientific advice in respect of decarbonising our economies to prevent catastrophic climate change.

Let's be clear, humans are a dumb animal and are unable to adapt without first suffering severely. Which means we will be too slow to adjust to climate change. Any wars or epidemics that happen now may slightly delay the inevitable end of humans. However, it's not likely that humans will stop breeding uncontrollably, because, like I said, we are dumb animals, and growing dumber all the time as far as I can see."

2020-01-30 19:00,"A worldwide pandemic is an eventual certainty. If it is not this outbreak (which seems unlikely), it will be another. It’s a matter of when and not if. We are woefully underprepared and death tolls will likely exceed the totals of the 1917-18 outbreak by a significant multiple. 

Nature has a way of controlling excesses and human population is clearly expanding beyond the planet’s carrying capacity.  We tend to take things seriously only when we are in a crisis and by then it is often too late.

2020-01-30 20:09,"The underlying sobering fact is that China is less than ten hours away from our shores by jet travel into our major cities.  We are not yet sure how  this virus operates (incubation, infection period) or how many infected people are already here. There is no guarantee that it will follow the same, manageable course that SARS did.  This is a terrible work in progress and could have devastating implications for the entire planet including severe social and economic disruption."
2020-01-31 19:53,"The 14 days are the maximum for how long it takes from exposure, before a person show actual symptoms.  However we have molecular techniques that can detect just a single viral particle (long before they have enough virus to be symptomatic).  To hold everybody locked up for 14 days is an absurd overreach.  This is populist panic over scientific knowledge - I am sure that order came from the White House.  

If it was simply just the matter of holding a small number of (this time white) people in cages for a few weeks the damage would be limited - and possibly even justified to control mass hysteria breaking out amongst the ignorant masses.  But a much larger danger comes from the fact that anybody who are convinced they have something important the MUST come home for will now attempt to get around public health care.  The last thing we want is a group of potentially infected people doing all they can to hide from the doctors."
2020-01-31 20:01,"That's as it should be. I'd be upset, too, if I had to remain in quarantine with other possible infected passengers. But there is far bigger picture developing here. Apart from the fact that 2 weeks is very short in the scheme of things, letting people free based on only 2 days of quarantine ignores that 1 or 2 people may come down ill later. There seems to be no mention of how these passengers would be released and physically taxied home. If given the possibility that only one person, who didn't show symptoms at the time, eventually sickens, that entire household, house, utensils, furniture, clothing and anything they touched, symbolizes a fresh ground zero. If only for 2 days, why do it at all?"
2020-01-31 20:12,Better 14 days than the chance of 14 (or whatever the number may turn out to be) more infected and continuing the cycle.
2020-01-31 20:29,"Think of this from the view of an informed citizen who may have been in contact with an infected individual.  

The probability that they are infected is VERY low (each infected person has hundreds of contacts with known or unknown people yet infects only 2-3 people on average).  Even if they have been infected, there is less than 20% chance of serious illness and less than 2% chance of death. If they were among those extremely, extremely unlucky people, the medical system cannot help them much anyway.  So being “found” and diagnosed has no real upside for that person (except for helping others).

Mandatory and excessive jailing of people who may have been infected creates a huge downside to being found and diagnosed with this virus.  If you have an important business, family or personal event coming up within the next few weeks will you come forward to a certain 2 weeks in jail – even if there is a less than 1% chance that you have the virus.  Even if you had the virus you could take precautions against transferring it to your loved ones.  

If we give mandatory 2 weeks jail to anybody who may be infected we will make it very hard to get the transmission rate down below 1.0 and we will almost certainly end up with a real epidemic and a serious problem."
2020-01-31 20:50,"There is a lot of second guessing going on by many who have the luxury of hindsight. Already, we have sequenced the virus, have a rapid test for it, and know how it is spread. We also know that a certain number of cases are relatively minor and a crude death rate. This is because of superb global epidemiologists and not because of thoughts and prayers.  Think of that next November when you vote for reps and Senators, as well as president. This knowledge is valuable and only if we decide in this country it is worthwhile, will we continue to have it.

I was in the first Sabin vaccine cohort, after I got the Salk vaccine.  I'm alive today probably because of that, vaccines, and penicillin for my multiple strep throats."

No tests or screening yet she had the symptoms listed.

2020-01-31 21:43,"There is a back story to this evacuation that seems to have escaped the attention of the media.

In a related NYT article earlier today, one of the US evacuees quarantined for 2 weeks at March Air Reserve Base described the flight:  “They were trying to keep us calm, but they had these guys covered from head to toe taking your temperature. It felt like a C.I.A. cargo plane.”

The plane used was in fact a windowless 747 cargo plane into which rows of passenger seats had been inserted.

The airline, Kalitta Air, was formed in 1967 during the time the US was using off-brand airlines, some of them funded or hired by the CIA or DoD, to transport weapons, personnel and materiel in the Vietnam theater and Asian.

Kalitta continues to carry cargo for the US government and others, with regular destinations including Bagram Airfield, Afghanistan; Guantanamo, Cuba; Medellin, Colombia; Osan Air Base, South Korea; and two UK air bases. Kalitta Air also serves non-military airports.

Other nations evacuating their citizens from China are using regular passenger airliners rather than cargo planes, which makes one wonder why the US government chose to take the extra time needed to re-fit a cargo plane, and whether such a plane will be used when the US evacuates more citizens from China in the next week.

While an interesting story lurks somewhere in the details, all of us of course owe Kalitta thanks for rescuing our fellow Americans from the hot zone of the coronavirus outbreak."

This all rings true, and echoes and re-echoes.

But, does America, and what we once called the ""free world,"" or whatever is left of it, have a viable strategy for containing, pressing back and clearly demonstrating a better way?

Absolute power corrupts absolutely, and even relative absolute power corrupts at least relatively, but a strategy counting on such corruption to trip itself up or stumble, or backfire more than it fires, is unwise and imprudent, to say the least."

We are likely to see more such mistakes and will be required to absorb their costs. Sadly, things are going to have to get worse before they get our attention in the many ways required to produce change."
2020-01-30 2:14,"Despite our monkey curiosity and inventiveness, our inability to prioritize our group survival over our individual aggrandizement--something that one would suspect an existentially conscious species could do--makes it more and more likely that homo sapiens is an evolutionary dead end.

Perhaps something just as intelligent but more altruistic will eventually evolve to inhabit the planet, assuming that we haven't poisoned or heated it sufficiently to preclude that."
2020-01-30 2:24,"Having received letters from Chinese friends on the mainland I can say they are scared. But I have not heard them complain about the government's handling of this crisis. 

It seems like many in the media will take every opportunity to criticize China's dictatorship. I would just say that China is not an easy country to govern.   

Years ago, the government decided to do away with the customary two-hour lunch.  The government thought they could dramatically increase productivity without this long lunch period which many Chinese use to nap.  

The response from the people in this country we always hear as a brutal dictatorship was immediate and decisive--strikes across the nation from students to farmers tying up traffic in the big cities with their tractors.  The government backed off that idea, quickly and never brought it up again.  

Once in a while, it would be gratifying to hear, especially from a responsible and wise columnist like Mr Kristof, some words of support and wishes for a quick solution that protects us all. 

I know, and I believe Mr Kristof knows also, kind words of support from the West would be much appreciated and long remembered in China."
2020-01-30 2:29,"Dear Mr. Kristof, You generally are very careful with what you say and thus what you say is usually true, but it is absolutely inaccurate for you to say ""China's economy is now as weak as it has been in 3 decades"". 

I mean are you really saying that China's current economy is not better than the 1990s? Maybe you are confusing the growth rate on the wealth instead of the wealth? In any case, there is no doubt that per capita, the Chinese are much much better off now than they were 30 years ago, even if growth is now lower."
2020-01-30 2:46,"This feels like a fairly simplistic analysis of China's response, a smug comparison where democracy always appears to win. 
If we had a similar virus that originated in NYC, what makes anyone think that the President--any President--would shut down the city like the Chinese have done?  More than 50 million people under quarantine?  It's impossible to even imagine, outside of massive fatalities, not simply hundreds. One could more easily make the argument that the Chinese, after a slow start, have been extremely decisive, in a way that would be almost impossible here.  
The American political leadership would face the fury of every business group that stood to suffer by a mass shutdown of cities. I suspect the first thing any leadership here would be thinking is: what happens to the stock market if we project fear? What happens to business confidence?  I'm certainly no fan of the Chinese dictatorship, but let's not kid ourselves about the superiority of our system. In the case of another existential threat, the lords of business here have been extraordinarily effective in making sure that we don't combat climate change if it hurts the bottom line.  Precaution is not a word in their lexicon."
2020-01-30 2:59,"We have now entered to age of world-level threats, without recourse to powerful and effective world-level coordination and governance (WHO is the most effective part of UN, and even it has no power over sovereign states).  So we have lived with the ever-present threat of nuclear annihilation, and now face disasters from climate change, just as ill-prepared. 

But with the density of humans in our largest cities worldwide, and the prevelant unsanitary conditions and practices spawned by economic or other constraints, the introduction of a deadly superbug that can evolve faster than we can tame it may indeed be the way civilization as we know it may end. An epidemic is a world-wide threat, and we need powerful world-level organizations to deal with them. In this context, powerful, authoritarian regimes are an impediment to making progress on global issues."
2020-01-30 3:08,I cannot say for sure whether Xi used his tight rule to control information of an epidemic. Thats is just a wild speculation. I don't think there was sufficient information to control. That and Coronavirus spread faster than anticipated. Whats important now is that China is doing everything to control the spread and has also invited International experts to contribute their expertise to stem the tide of the spread of this deadly virus which is just now being characterized and understood.
2020-01-30 3:11,"The west's response has been little better.  There is only one way to contain this and it is through quarantine.  A health check should be mandatory for those coming to the west.  And for those coming from China a two week quarantine for those failing the test. 

Quarantine worked throughout history.  We need to overcome the absurd PC objections to it, and do it again. Problems solved."
2020-01-30 3:11,A century ago the Spanish flu infected 500 million people (about a quarter of the world's population at that time) with a death toll that might have been as high as 100 million.  What if this coronavirus has the capability of inflicting such a global toll?  It should be considered a crime against humanity to have withheld vital information about it for so long.
2020-01-30 3:26,"This seems a little hyperbolic to me.

This is a very serious situation, but not to the point of hysteria.

China cannot continue to not regulate wet markets given their impact on the globe, that is for certain.

That said, the World, and especially the  USA  based multi-national corporation, has definitely benefited, economically, from China's dictatorship.

So much so, in fact, that we are institutionalizing a dictatorship in this nation as I write this.

So Mr.K  nice article and as usual  a little too late.. try 25 years too late. We needed Clinton back in 1994 to do what Trump has done in 2020  but even he has gone far enough."
2020-01-30 4:01,This is not what I was seeing . The details were known in December and there was a lot of research done at the time as scientists tried to understand wat was happening. Its easy to blame China for this but the reality is it is doing a phenomenal job right now to contain it at a massive cost. I doubt whether if this had happened in the US things would have been any different.
2020-01-30 4:10,"""And act decisively they did — not against the virus, but against whistle-blowers who were trying to call attention to the public health threat""
     I cannot agree more, the Chinese officials have not moved fast enough to contain this epidemic.
     This illness has already spread all over China including Tibet, killing more than 130 people, that is the Chinese official count but you cannot trust the transparency of the Chinese government in this matter, the actual death count could be much more than that.
    At this point, a quarantine in Wuhan is not enough to stop the spread of the coronavirus in China.
     A scientific assessment of the spread of the disease, assuming an optimistic 90 percent quarantine, still predicted more than 59,000 infections and 1,500 deaths — twice the toll of the 2002-2003 SARS outbreak.
      China’s health minister said the coronavirus is increasing in virulence and now could be contagious even before people exhibit symptoms, making apparently healthy people possible carriers.
     This illness is a tragedy for China and the rest of the world. Unfortunately, there is no vaccine to prevent this illness and it will take more than a year to develop a vaccine by then who knows how many more people will die."
2020-01-30 4:22,"It’s a bit funny (but not ha-ha funny) that while health authorities in the United States (e.g., CDC and state and local health agencies) say we need to stop falling for social media rumor mongering and disinformation, Mr. Kristof is saying that the average Chinese citizen’s lack of access to social media discussion of this outbreak is a sign that things are rotten there.

I work in public health information and we try as hard as we can to be first, be right, and be credible (the mantra of public health communications in times of crisis). While it’s quite possible Chinese authorities failed on the first two, thus adversely affecting the last one, the solution is for them to do better on all three, not to just toss everything to the winds of social media.

And while we’re pointing fingers at governments over this crisis, let’s not forget that our own government, in the first three years of this administration, has sought to slash CDC’s budget for overseas disease surveillance, a course of action that is mind-bogglingly ignorant and short-sighted. 

Imagine how much better off we’d be if Chinese authorities had had a robust relationship with CDC professionals in China to help them out, from the get-go. This failure is on us."
2020-01-30 4:32,"It is eerie to see photographs of the now empty streets of Wuhan approximately the size of Chicago, and Beijing is also notably free of traffic.

Perhaps it is fake news, but the leader of China is apparently willing to have international relief agencies help the residents now ensconced in their homes.  

Regardless of this highly contagious virus plaguing China and beyond, people remaining in these cities are in need of medical supplies, water and food.

Transportation to the Wuhan Red Cross Hospital is not enough to sustain others who are fortunate not to have succumbed to Coronavirus.

Granted it takes courage for humanitarian workers to enter these red zone urban sites, but funds are needed for The International Red Cross, UNICEF, and many other caring agencies and non-governmental organizations to be on hand with life essentials.

Remembering the elderly English teacher at our school in France, born of missionary parents in China, surely there must be beneficial ways of placing aside our differences, a moment in time, where America leads the World in caring for others trapped in these political essays."
2020-01-30 4:37,"A government that resisted reality because there were fears for its reputation.  Doctors disciplined for giving truthful warnings - I hope the world can see where this kind of thing can lead.

2020-01-30 4:56,"Donald Trump, realizing that the 1st Amendment and the ballot box pose minimal threats to his grip on power, flaunts low employment and the Dow-Jones average as justification for his second term. In a similar manner Xi has convinced the average Chinese that according him the power to enforce whatever draconian measures are needed to stifle dissent will ensure that county maintains economic growth. Research has satisfactorily proved that no curse exists in Chinese about ""living in interesting times,"" but the times we live in have certainly become interesting."
2020-01-30 5:29,"Mr. Kristof:

I am sensing both hypocrisy and cynicism in this column.

Hypocrisy, because the United States has faltered several times in the past in meeting public health emergencies: during Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans and more recently during the hurricanes that befell Puerto Rico. What was that about people who live in glass houses?

Cynicism because I think that you are trying to exploit this emergency to advance an anti-Chinese agenda. Whatever you want to say about the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), there is no denying that it has unified a very fractious and divided country and has provided the discipline and focus necessary to lift 800M people out of poverty and create the largest middle class and most billionaires in the history of the world. All within the span of just over 40 years.

There may have been an initial false start, but it is clear that the Chinese government is now laser focused and determined to control this emergency. It is generally unwise to create a panic in a city the combined size of New York AND Chicago until you have a good idea of what you are up against. Required resources have been rapidly mobilized and deployed. Two 1,000 bed hospitals are being built and will be up and running within one week. Physicians, nurses and other personnel have been brought in. The US couldn’t pull that off. 

Although Wuhan is under quarantine, basic necessities including food are readily available.

An authoritarian government does have certain advantages."

But at the same time China is generating all this anxiety in a US fearing it will be inevitably be displaced as world leader by this definitive ""other"". (God help the US once the economic cushion to print money provided by the ""Petro Dollar"" system is gone - and it will be.) China is at once a major strategic threat on technology, military (mostly asymmetric the Chinese will never be stupid enough or enough under the thumb of their MIC to spend like the US does on the military), and economic grounds but also very much a developing country very much divided into developmental tiers comprising hundreds of millions. Jetson's style first tier 21st Century China (Shanghai/Beijing/Tianjin etc..) often exists beside 1990s China of the 2nd tier cities and 1980s China of the rural areas. One thing though they are all moving forward. All boats are visibly floating up and spending on infrastructure/education for the general good is everywhere. Hence despite income inequality historic satisfaction with government. Let's try not to get giddy when it stumbles. It's not
a good look."
2020-01-30 6:04,"A great deal of credit must be given to the scientists, from both China and the US, for the international cooperation in freely and very quickly sharing information on public databases about this virus. The complete genome was quickly sequenced and uploaded to GenBank by China. Our own CDC has likewise uploaded genomes of all US patients. They have also developed an RT-PCR assay that they are making freely available to international repositories. Behind the scenes, behind all the politics, have always been scientists who have managed to keep information like this available to anybody in the world because they know it is the right thing to do. We take this for granted today, but in the earlier days of biotech there was a movement towards privatizing sequences for profit. I doubt that many people in Washington realized what GenBank meant, and we are all better off because they didn't figure it out."

It’s only natural to China-bashing. But the media and internet response towards coronavirus really is something else. To mainstream media this is simply another opportunity to slamming China and its government. And to internet it just unleashed gate of the racism and bigotry towards the Chinese. I have seen views such as virus as god-send to eliminate all dog-eating Chinese, culling of the undesirable, and other much worse sentences. I have never seen similar sentiments when a disaster reached US among Chinese internet.

As far as people here they generally very supportive of government efforts and showing incredible solidarity. And the government is indeed very focused on this issue. Tens of thousands of trucks carrying medic supplies and food into the cities that’s been quarantined. Of course those is not known in the west as this defeats the objective of bashing Chinese government. Sure government has flaws in its approach(authoritarian).

And our U. S. president does not ""squelch"" the independent people around him, he totally ignores them or he abandons them and ruins their lives, sometimes permanently.

Really Mr. Kristof? When was the last time you met an American who 'admired' Xi's authoritarian model?

This virus is not the result of China having an authoritarian government. The outbreak happened in China because 'live markets' are an ingrained element of the culture. China needs to ban this trade if they want to prevent the outbreaks.

Was the poisoning of Flint's water supply the result of our having a Democratic government? No, it was the result of corruption. It could have happened anywhere where corruption exists.

Was our 'Democratic' government responsible for the AIDS epidemic being ignored for so long? No, it was politicians who were derelict in their duty to protect Americans. It wasn't a failure of the Democratic system.

China is not happy about this outbreak. Many Chinese are worried for themselves and their families. I hope the outbreak ends quickly. Mr. Kristof sees the outbreak as one more opportunity to criticize the Chinese government. Yes, it's an authoritarian government. NO, the outbreak wasn't caused by authoritarianism."

The current, Republican US government cracks down particularly hard on those who do and report science and facts.

China has an actual dictator.

The US has a wannabe dictator.

Democracy can spread much like a virus; however, both countries are doing more to suppress democracy than the coronavirus. And both countries make relatively little effort to prevent the conditions, mostly in unsanitary places with lots of animals, that causes real viruses to mutate.

And these are two countries with among the largest economies in the world, whose leadership and cooperation are critical to minimizing climate change.

God Bless"
2020-01-30 12:08,"Dear Mr Kristoff, your article is a cautionary tale. Would that our Republican Senators read it and take heed, as they vigorously  attack the safeguards of democracy in our own nation, e.g. free press, balance of powers..."
2020-01-30 12:08,"Mr. Kristof,

My own perception of the current coronavirus outbreak is:  The outbreak emanated from a public meat market where, in parts of China, live animals were/are sold, and, probably bats were part of that market.

This type of market exists in other countries as well including India and Mexico which are democracies.

Indeed this kind of market even exists, in small enclaves in the United States, which is still widely viewed as a Democracy.

My own perception of Xi's response is that it was fairly rapid, and, fairly aggressive and much information has been communicated by his government and social media has also helped.

The origin of the coronavirus is really not President Xi.

Rather, the origin is crushing poverty brought on by overpopulation and past Chinese governance that produces crushing poverty.

Any place where overpopulation is rampant and the population is dense and very poor can produce this kind of outbreak.  

To blame a single man, no matter your impression of whether he is a capable ruler or not (indeed, his country has accomplished a lot compared to the US in the last 10 years), 

is really not fair or correct interpretation of an outbreak that has origins in poverty and dense population and hunger, which, is sort of a global phenomena."
2020-01-30 12:15,"""Dictators often make poor decisions because they don’t get accurate information: When you squelch independent voices you end up getting just flattery and optimism from those around you.""

This statement just sent a chill down my spine.  We have a duly elected president, not a dictator, at least not yet.  But he sure behaves like Xi and he admires Xi and yes, makes decisions like Xi.  

It makes me wonder if it's only a matter of time before we face a similar kind of crisis due to the same kind of behavior."
2020-01-30 12:45,"Mr. Kristof always comes across as well informed.  In this piece he shares his considered opinion that China's dictatorship bears much responsibility for exposing the world to a greater threat than was necessary.
In elementary school (I graduated) it came up that when judging presidents, or kings, even governments for that matter, some consideration need be given to the the cards they are dealt, the situation they inherited.
What is the motivation for taking a dark view of China's response here.  Is it to prevent a shift away from a globalist agenda?
We cannot know.  
China once again is the source of a possible epidemic, the world will have to protect itself as well as possible.  
Without really knowing all the facts and all the relevant factors shaping policy, fault finding seems empty.
Not that it isn't motivated by that non guarantor of bliss, good intentions."
2020-01-30 12:49,"""Coronavirus Spreads, and the World Pays for China’s Dictatorship""
We can blame Dictatorship but don't we have the ability to robustly control the problem domestically through travel restrictions?

Perhaps one of the prices of planning travel to or doing business with a country with a reputation of originating SARS and Corona Virus is the possibility of disrupted travel.  Robust travel restrictions might also make this a business and tourism issue for China and help motivate them to improve their health practices."
2020-01-30 12:52,"Dear Nicolas,

I am just wondering, how much did Xi really know about the outbreak from the start?  No where in your article is able to prove this link.  My suspicion here is that the local government of Wuhan knew about this and tried to cover it up, passing it off as a flu outbreak rather than a novel coronavirus.  They only reported it to the Central Government when it got out of control.  This occurred much later.  And as some of the comments published here mentioned, your article ignores the fact that the Chinese response has been a vast improvement from how SARS was handled more than a decade ago, and several virology and infectious disease experts have praised its response.  I think the Chinese people -- and government -- should be praised, in some ways at least, for their selfless response in many ways to the events that have happened.   I felt your article neglected all the above facts, but thank you for sharing your opinion."
2020-01-30 13:10,"A completely unwarranted attack on China!

The Chinese authorities swiftly identified and confirmed the new virus, provided detection and treatment, and quarantined millions of potential spreaders of the disease.

Such a response was possible because Chinese cities and provinces are highly organized, and the central government is decisive. 

I fear you mistake talk for accomplishment, and loose speech for profound communication. 

Just imagine an outbreak of a similar disease in Kentucky! The CDC would spend several weeks studying the situation and drafting recommendations to the Administration. Trump would denounce it as a hoax. Various members of Congress would speculate and postulate. The lack of medical personnel and facilities would limit effective diagnosis and treatment."

2020-01-30 13:20,"I just wanted to enquire whether anyone from China was actually interviewed about the reaction to the unknown virus. I stayed in Beijing, China from November to January as part of an exchange programme and the word of an unknown virus from Wuhan was already blowing up in early December. I think it's misleading to imply that the Chinese population were blind from this issue and that the government ket it secret from everyone. Many knew, and everyone was telling their children to wash their hands and to take caution due to the existence of the unknown virus - and this is in Beijing where there were no reported cases of this unknown virus anyway. Obviously my experiences don't speak to the whole population of China, but I realised if I already knew about it in probably around December 4th to 5th, surely a huge proportion of the population would have heard about it...SARS still is a scarring memory for everyone and when word got out of an ~unknown patient with an unknown virus~ (you get the ghist of what happened). Of course I'd expect the Chinese government did underestimate the scale of it but I do feel this article is heavily critical of Xi and gives a sense that there is no sense of freedom in China, without praising the vast improvement it has made since the disastrous SARS effort, its transparency over the deaths and infections etc. Living in China is completely different than what is written all over in the media."

The speed of the revelation about the outbreak of corona virus and for the world health alert is laudable given the location and form of government. Going back a generation, how did the Western media react to AIDS and reveal the truth about the transmission of that deadly virus prior to its global spread and casualty rate? It was years before reaction and medical information was forthcoming and it continued under the shadow of political correctness rather than science and truth, leading to infection and death for countless innocent victims.
 
Limiting and suppressing the dissemination of information Mr. Kristof attributes to Chinese dictatorship is systemic to the left regardless of location. It mirrors the suppression of a free press whether couched in political correctness or unapologetic communism."

2020-01-30 13:40,"The place to stop epidemics is at the start. Most of the flu, SARS, and coronavirus outbreaks of the past twenty years began in southern China because of the confluence of humans, pigs, ducks, and certain species of bats that live in vast numbers and close quarters, producing an ideal environment for contagious viruses to mutate and jump between species. The solution isn't arm-waving, it is that China must modernize its agricultural sector, which will disrupt the lives of over a hundred million small farmers. Unfortunately there is no choice."

About this: ""Viruses are challenges for any country, and it’s only fair to note that China does a better job protecting its people from measles than the U.S. does."" One has to assume (no link is provided) that this is due to the government's authority in China to mandate vaccinations -- if we made them mandatory we'd do better as well."
2020-01-30 13:42,"As Kristof put it, with a dose of humility I want to get over the misplaced admiration I had for the Chinese model of governance!

Zhang’s book China Shock and Sashi Tharoor’s book Pax Indica: India and World of the 21st Century are study in contrast of India and China.

These two public intellectuals show how India and China both see themselves as alternative models of development and world order that challenge the prevailing western-dominated international system.

But they offer different sorts of model as a replacement. China sees itself as an alternative to the US, and its liberal democracy and neo-liberal capitalism. India, on the other hand, presents itself as an Asian democratic alternative to China’s authoritarian capitalist model.

Zhang’s book is characterized by negative much more time criticizing India while Tharoor talks of the human cost of the China model, “because China’s breakneck speed of development has meant that ""some necks have been broken"". He concludes that while China has successfully built the ""hardware"" of development (infrastructure and industry), India is better at creating the ""software"" of development (technology, law and services)”.
But we’re now seeing the dangers of Xi’s authoritarian model, for China and the world. 

More important, this crisis should provide some decisive inputs on China-India debate on  the merits  of democracy, providing an interesting twist to the popular thesis that sees democracy as ""western"" and order as ""Asian""."
2020-01-30 13:56,"Kristof makes a valid point.  In retrospect it is a powerful point.  If medical professionals sounded an alarm in early December, as he states and if their voices were silenced by their government, then an early opportunity to minimize danger from this virus was lost, at the hands of government officials, although I suspect lower level officials afraid of displeasing their bosses.  It reminds me of the willing obliviousness in this country, discounting the findings of scientists, a trend that may soon backfire and cause serious harm to us."
2020-01-30 14:07,"Mr. Kristof, you're observations on the Chinese authoritarian model are spot-on, especially concerning this virus outbreak. And I hate to be the one to point out the elephant in the living room, but how can Americans observe the pitfalls of authoritarian government in China while simultaneously allowing the US to take giant leaps in the same direction? All of the mistakes you mentioned in your editorial are things that we are barreling toward at breakneck speed: suppressing dissent, punishing whistle-blowers, curbing the free press and social media, which would be immeasurably helpful in fighting the spread of the virus. 

Yes, Xi allowed himself to be dragged, kicking & screaming, into doing the right thing - eventually. And perhaps the US, too, will somehow find a way to eventually work toward finding solutions, as we finally did with the AIDS crisis. But how many lives have to be lost in the process, while we're all stumbling around, trying to decide whether the authoritarian model of government is a good idea or not?"

By my second teaching stint, I could get the Times on the internet, whereas in my first year, my only source were friends who emailed me articles.  There was a real thaw with Taiwan, and although students and friends would not talk openly in public, they did in private.  It was clear that Xi's actions in Hong Kong would hinder any chance of Taiwan making a deal to become part of the mainland.  Other than this, I have thoroughly enjoyed your books with Ms Dunn."
2020-01-30 14:38,"If China were a democracy, would it have been able to contain this epidemic better? I honestly can't think so. At a local government level, officials in China have not, and would not, be experienced enough to recognize and take significantly more effective action. If anything, the crackdown on holiday travel by the central government would likely have occurred slower in a democracy leading to much faster spread around the country. 

I understand the argument that the silencing of doctors contributed to a late response by the Chinese government, but I still find it hard to believe everything would have been much better in a democratic style government. China has such densely populated cities. I just hope they can contain it."
2020-01-30 14:39,"No matter what, not just this virus but the influenza viruses themselves emerge, year after year, from Southeast Asia, most often historically from China, due to the animal farming and marketing practices. Keeping multiple kinds of animals together in close quarters with slaughtering and food production in the same proximity, leads to the intermingling of viruses and the greatly enhanced ability for them to mutate and develop new and stronger strains. We have known this for many decades and the Chinese government, which is authoritarian and has had and still has the power to do something about practices, has neglected to do so for all these years, spawning MERS, SARS, the swine flu epidemics, and this coronavirus. One can only hope this will move them to finally crack down decisively against their dangerous farming and market practices once and for all. It would have been so much easier and less expensive than building new hospitals in a matter of days or decimating your entire GDP for weeks or months."

2020-01-30 14:46,"Why is it that most people believe by default that an authoritarian government will gradually increase individual liberty and that the government will gradually become more accountable to the people it rules?

For decades, that has been the assumption regarding China.  And the richer China became, the stronger was that assumption.

But I see no reason for such a belief.  It seems to me that authoritarian governments become more authoritarian as time passes, especially if they attain diplomatic and economic successes since those seem to the dictators to confirm their belief in their own dictatorial legitimacy.  There does seem to be a limit as eventually the authoritarian government is overthrown.  But it is usually the case that an overthrown authoritarian government is immediately or soon replaced by another authoritarian government rather than one that guarantees individual liberty."

The major of the problems arise from China's government controlled centralized economy, and China's highly centralized health care system.

You don't have to go to China to learn about such systems.  All you have to do his read the policy statements of Sen. Elizabeth Warren.

This of course is not entirely fair; unlike China, Sen. Warren supports the democratic election of our government.  And ""medicare for all"" does not, at least initially, mean a government takeover of the practice of medicine.  But there is nonetheless some truth to my analogy."

Aside from issues of cruelty to animals, how many epidemics, or even pandemics will occur for people to make the associations, determine how many things are wrong in animal agriculture as we now know it, and then decide there is a better way to produce food for the world?    1.4 billion that love their meat (I noted your mention of the incredible cost to the pig industry, and a lot of pork is eaten in China) ...well, it takes a lot of intensive confinement of millions of animals to meet that ""meat"" demand.

In our age of misinformation, even with a free press, I shudder to think how an outbreak here in the US would have been spun by wingnuts in social media. Look at the vaccination debate.

In regard to the slowing growth rate in China, really there are two factors that drive this: 1. as their economy matures, their growth rate will slow; 2. the one-child policy has set them up to have a rapidly aging, and then shrinking population. The latter will drive down domestic growth even further."
2020-01-30 3:27,"Kristoff is right, and since Chinese state media cannot investigate the failures of its censorious communist system, we who live in freedom must constantly shine a light on the fruits of Xi Jinping  Thought. All the more when people outside of China get infected and die. Indeed, turning a blind eye to authoritarianism constitutes a greater danger than Coronavirus."
2020-01-30 12:57,"Thank you to Nicholas Kritof for this excelent column. I just wanted to point out that the pig epidemics he is refering to is probably not flu (influenza virus) but african swine fever, a severe disease of pigs induced by the ASF virus, which, in contrast to flu, is not a zoonotic agent (this virus does not infect humans)."
2020-01-30 1:33,"Mr.Kristof, I'm no particular fan of China's government and  I'm sure there are many shortcomings with their model. I'm also not going to defend what the Chinese government did relative to the outbreak of the coronavirus. But your column seems to be obsessed with president Xi Jinping being a ""dictator"", and perhaps by strict definition he may be. But the Chinese government doesn't seem to function that much differently than many governments. I certainly would not trust THIS government at the local, state or federal level to respond to a  civil crisis in an expeditious manner; Hurricane Katrina, Puerto Rico two recent examples.
""Dictators often make poor decisions because they don’t get accurate information:"" well, so do American Presidents, even in an alleged Democracy, i.e. Iraq, Vietnam. I'm not sure what your'e trying prove with the article, but for any and every miscue, falsehood, lie you find with the Chinese government, given time and resources, we can find them in the US government and virtually all others. It's human nature, right?
It's great that you keep us apprised of what's going on around the world, but be careful about throwing stones at other countries while your'e living in the glass house of America."
2020-01-30 16:05,"Why should we actually believe the coronavirus narrative. The CDC/WHO have been wrong (crimi8nally wrong) on pandemics so often that they need to provide real evidence. Remember the zika pandemic? Where are the vast numbers of microcephaly cases that never happened? Remember the swine flu pandemic? Another flop, with the CDC claiming tens of thousands of casualties that never happened but numerous cases of narcolepsy from the vaccine. The list goes on. Maybe this time they are right, but consider that the terrible air pollution in Wuhan and other Chinese cities has caused weakened the respiratory and immune systems of the population, making them more susceptible to infection.

Let me also mention Kesan's disease in China that ultimately was found to be the result of selenium deficiency in the soil. Pellagra was thought to be the result of some pathogen ,but was the result of niacin deficiency. We look for viral causes first (vaccines make money, after all) and ignore environmental and nutritional causes. To our peril but profit for the pharmaceutical industry."
2020-01-30 1:49,"Can't argue with the op-ed about dictatorships, and how they control the narrative. It can and does lead to events such as this new virus breakout.

But then you have a Democracy that is murdering thousands and thousands of citizens year in and year with guns. And this democracy does nothing about it. Then this crisis of opioids that was spawned by the pharmaceutical companies and medical community. And thousands are being killed by that too. 

We really need to clean up our house too."
2020-01-30 1:49,"Thanks sharing another worthwhile piece.   I seem to read everything with a myopic lens these days because the quote that stood out most to me was: ""...When you squelch independent voices you end up getting just flattery and optimism from those around you..."" because that is exactly how it appears many of our current leaders would prefer it to be here too.  

Also - it is a credit to China and rather shameful for the US if ""a baby born in Beijing today has a longer life expectancy than a baby born in Washington, D.C."""

Donald Trump is about to become acquitted without witnesses because the true patriots of the US, the whistleblowers - were made into and depicted as criminals.  Trump is the most authoritarian president in our history, and another 4 years will only allow him to use his power even more excessively.  Please people - look at what's happening in China because it is a true harbinger of what could eventually happen to the America we know and love."
2020-01-30 1:56,"Having received letters from Chinese friends on the mainland I can say they are scared.  But I have not them complain about the government's handling of this crisis.

It seems like many in the media will take every opportunity to criticize China's governing mechanisms whenever there is a problem there.

I would just say that China is not an easy country to govern.  First, there are five times as any people there as we have in the USA.   There are many ethnic groups and hundreds of dialects, and lots of natural features like mountains and rivers to keep people apart.

Once in a while, it would be gratifying to hear, especially from a responsible and wise columnist like Mr Kristof, some words of support and wishes for a quick solution for us all.

I know, and I believe Mr Kristof knows also, kind words of support from the West would be much appreciated and long remembered in China."
2020-01-30 3:15,"A little perspective is needed here.  Experts in virology and epidemology, as opposed to pundits with a ideological ax to grind, have all praised China's response. In the middle of flu season, the Chinese were able to identify, isolate, and sequence a totally new virus in two weeks--an incomparable medical hat trick; able to trace it down to the first outbreak;  shut down the probably cause; implement prophylactic measures; while mobilizing 1000's of doctors to the afflicted areas--and avoid a panic.  Note also, nocebo effects are real; and a panic based on rumors could have created the epidemiological equivalent of a bank run.  
Compare that to what the US did for Southern California 2009 H1N1 A flu: allowed to it spread rampant with no concern for borders or for its neighbors.  At the end of that ""democratic""-capitalist-laissez-faire experiment, between 150,000-575,000 people--80% under 65--lay dead in hospitals, mortuaries, and streets, mostly in the impoverished South.   
Or if memory  fails, more recently, the 8200 people who have died since last October, or the 1400 people who died last week from the flu in the US.
But to consider the above facts would mess with your narrative of White, American, Capitalist supremacy.  So you prefer, when human beings are suffering--and trying their absolute best--not to pass up an opportunity to bash China and the Chinese.  And people wonder why we are headed towards war."
2020-01-30 16:06,"And adding salt to injury, China is hellbent on blocking Taiwan, a country which can be a proactive participant in containing corona virus, from joining World Health Organization under United Nation.   For a health organization that should be building an effective global health network, WHO's political kowtowing to China is not only unfortunate, it is dangerous."
2020-01-30 6:37,"While reading this my mind kept wandering back to our present political environment. What would make us think that Trump would not react similarly as Xi if allowed to. After all, Trump not only admires this modern-day dictator, but also, I believe, aspires to be like him. And I am seeing - and barely enduring - his own Party too cowardly and too afraid to rein in their mercurial and unstable leader. Yes, we are not suppressed...yet. Yes, thank God, our freedom of speech, the press, and assembly are not taken from us...yet. But let us not be naive or ignorant to the fact that under this administration the days of a thriving democracy and strong Constitution are being threatened on a daily basis."
2020-01-30 10:15,"Gorbachev has said that the Chernobyl disaster was the beginning of the end of the Soviet Union.

There, too, the nuclear physicists were afraid to tell the truth to their higher ups. And, disaster ensued.

China has had a long history (centuries) of political instability. This “Communist Party” era shall too pass, and only be remembered in the dusty history books.

And, remember how we thought Japan was the rising power back in the ‘80s. Ha! China power, too, will be seen as a temporary chimera."
2020-01-30 12:07,"How will president Trump handle the Coronavirus epidemic in America? We are witnessing today an epidemic like the Spanish Flu that decimated populations around the world in 1918, as the Bubonic Plague devastated Europe in the 1400s, 50 million people killed.

Nick Kristof, you say that Xi Jinping's dictatorship in China has crushed civil society and allowed the Coronavirus virus to spread.  Wouldn't President Trump's unlimited executive powers of his presidency (as Alan Dershowitz advocated virally in Trump's Senate Impeachment Trial yesterday) make Donald Trump America's first President-Dictator? And how many people will die in our hemisphere when this 21st century plague hits us?"
2020-01-30 14:17,"Yes, of course, a system of government in China that allowed more freedom of expression rather than too often punishing those who speak up or might be “whistleblowers” would benefit their nation and the world. Sadly, we don’t need to look far to see that our government is quite flawed. When you have a major U.S.  political party attempt to discount and hide the truth about Ukraine (and “out” the whistleblower and discredit every other person who has testified) or even more troubling for our world call climate change a hoax America has significant “sins” of its own. 

I am sure many of the comments published in The NY Times would not appear in any paper or online in China. But, with many legislators refusing to listen to our voices, our cries for government assistance or at least encouragement regarding health care, climate, gun violence, opioids, etc.,etc. it is almost as bad. Yes, vote!"
2020-01-30 15:59,"Excellent column. I travelled to China about 40 times between 2008 and 2018 to improve air quality. On that issue, they've gotten right. But, like Nicholas, I've also witnessed the increasing strangling of information. Even with a VPN, it is almost impossible to access the NY Times website in China. And, to get a sense of how you are monitored, after I published a supportive comment on a Keith Bradsher article about China's efforts to reduce pollution, I was blocked from the NY Times for 24 hours. One should assume that every keystroke is monitored. On Skype calls, my wife and I would joke that we should pretend to be engaging in wild and dirty sexual talk just to get a rise out of the people that we knew were listening to us.

The One Child Nation movie shows the complicity of Chinese people to simply obey orders, even when they know they are wrong. (that didn't work for Lt. Calley either..). Xi is known as ""Mao Version 2.0"", and he has broad support from the people. 

But, I believe a combination of how China is reacting to this virus, coupled with the horrible construction methods (I routinely saw 1 inch by 25 foot cracks in new concrete in luxury hotel stairways), and the lack of a population to support the elderly will accelerate the speed with which Xi will be unable to stay in power. And, we know from history that those results can be very ugly for a time."

China's rigid information control has undoubtedly exacerbated a terrible crisis, but even with good information, is the US health system ready for an outbreak?  

Millions are without health care, millions more have poor access to care, and still more are not financially stable enough to endure a serious illness in their family-- and all are terrified of the financial consequences brought by the emergency room.  When the crisis is a virus, that's a recipe for disaster.

At the same time, the White House is occupied by the man least prepared to handle a crisis.  (I would predict video of Trump throwing paper towels at people, but he is too much a coward to actually visit a site hosting victims.)  And if the virus spreads to a City that he believes is a ""Democratic city"", will he even pretend to help?  Or will he just tweet vindictive bile?"
2020-01-30 3:07,"- Xi is also imprisoning/killing corrupt bureaucrats, greening vast portions of the Gobi desert, converting the country to sustainable energy, and setting up a trade infrastructure that will guarantee Chinese economic dominance of Asia and Africa for the next 100 years.  

- They have a terrific night life in China, where women, children, and the elderly are free to roam the streets at night without fear of getting shot or mugged.  

- Drugs, gambling, and guns are all illegal.  

- They have the best train system in the world and new highways everywhere.  

- Phone payment for all manner of goods is ubiquitous.  

- Their people are extremely hard working and save much of what they earn.  

- Their education system completely blows the U.S. out of the water.  

- They have had +6% GDP growth for over 30 years.

2020-01-30 3:39,"Mr. Kristof, thank you for having the courage to elucidate what others seem far too afraid to report, and to the NYT’s for printing. Waiting almost a month to even alert the WHO about a novel corona virus and then doing nothing while 5 million people left Wuhan should not bring kudos from around the world praising XI. Allowing the deadly live exotic animal markets to remain open so long after SARS occurred was a disaster in waiting.  I’m glad someone with your extensive knowledge and experience in China has the guts to call this secretive and oppressive regime what it is."

2020-01-30 10:39,"I think your criticism of Chinese Government is fair. I would hope that you praised healthcare workers who are bravely doing their best. I think in epidemics such as these you have two main problems - managing the disease and managing information. You do not have to be a dictator to mess up the later. Many African leaders who were not necessarily dictators mismanaged the Ebola outbreak. I think it is also fair to question certain practices of a society which increase the hazard many fold - handling the dead in Africa, eating wildlife in China etc. You also failed to comment on the governmental structure in China where bad news is kept away from the central leadership as they tend to shoot the messenger."
2020-01-30 3:15,"One lesson I hope the Chinese finally learn this time: it’s a really, really bad idea to eat wild animals. The DNA of the coronavirus ultimately derives from viruses from poisonous snakes, offered for sale in the Wuhan seafood market. The Chinese government regulates so many aspects of its citizens’ lives; maybe they should try to eliminate the marketing of wild beasts for food. (Sure beats cleaning up after yet another epidemic and hoping that we won’t get another 1917 flu.)"

2020-01-30 11:39,"We humans have had over 100 years to correct the error of referring to the pandemic of the misnamed “Spanish flu” that infected over 500 million and killed over 50 million. 

That also originated in China in the mid 1910s, but, then, as now, Chinese authorities (reporting ultimately to the Emperor, NOT Communist Party officials or a “dictator”) suppressed the information and punished those who tried to get the information out. 

So we have an apples to apples comparison of a non-communist and non-dictator led China in a pandemic crisis with a Communist one, 

I think the Communist government response is 100x superior. Don’t you? Wouldn’t everyone who knew this? 

It’s worth pointing out the Chinese Communist Party does not get enough credit for the lives saved by instituting the One Child Per Family policy. I think the CCP should get receive the Nobel Peace Prize for this. 

A western style democratic government would have allowed a currency population of 2.5 billion people to be in an area with only 6% of the world’s fresh water. And I doubt that country would be the world leader in both manufacturing and installing solar photovoltaics and other types of clean energy. 

The alternate history China of 2.5 billion people in 2020 would not have lifted so many its citizens out of poverty. It would not have become the world’s largest creditor to the developing world, extending $5 trillion in loans. It would be a source of far more pandemics, and be far more quiet about them."

Humanity needs objective assessments of the worsening situation including what could be learned so far to contain the virus spreading. The measures that China has taken are historically unprecedented. Xi is depicted as dictator for good reasons, however, the crisis this time had more to do with the greediness of those ""experts"" sent to Wuhan by central government to investigate and monitor the disease. They withheld critical information about the high propensities of man to man spreading of the coronavirus for personal gain of publishing data in top journals. This, in no small part, led to the delayed actions. The entire world scientific community needs to learn from this hugely painful lesson."

Have to agree with Kristof on this point: USA is in no position to lecture anyone about health. China is by no means flawless, up and down Chinese society they still have a lot of problems to solve. But China has demonstrated by its track record as a fast learner. Kristof will be disappointed just like other predictors of China's pending crash."

2020-01-30 3:34,"President Xi, despite his mistake in handling this matter, is still WAY better than the dictator currently undergoing an impeachment trial here in the US. 

With a lot more clear, scientific information, and decades of data, Trump can't even admit that climate change is real. In doing so, he puts the entire nation, indeed the entire planet at great risk for consequences much more dire than the coronavirus.    

Xi suppressed information, probably to avoid panic.  It was a bad idea.  But Trump promotes massive amounts of disinformation.  His favorite ""news"" channel is Faux Noise because they're willing to push his disinformation campaigns:  ""Windmills cause cancer!""  Together, Faux Noise and Trump have effectively brain washed about 40% of America with a non-stop depiction of alternative reality.  

Republican presidents have a terrible track record of handling epidemics, too.  Reagan would not even use the word AIDS at the height of one of the worst epidemics in US history!  Much less did Reagan do anything to prevent the spread and find treatments.

Forget China's dictator.  I'm MUCH more worried about America's dictator.  He's way more unhinged and unscrupulous than President Xi could ever be.  And Trump will end up causing more death and destruction than Xi could do."
2020-01-30 3:50,"Don't worry Mr. Kristof, Trump is doing everything in his power to control information in the Senate rather than resign and stop the corruption. Once Trump is fully ensconced as a dictator he will make sure that information doesn't flow.

Note that it was not some ""illegal"" bringing the disease over our borders either. So that's another GOP talking point downed by reality.

Don't you remember the old adage: People in glass houses shouldn't throw stones."

I'd just like to add that ending the disgusting and dangerous trade in dead and increasingly endangered wild animals for food or medicine use in China is very much in President Xi's hands. I fear such is felt by him and other Han Chinese to be essentially tied in the past, now and for all time, with people of his and their ethnicity, when such is actually a big, fat lie. It is merely ""traditional"" and some ""traditions"" need to die. If he doesn't act it will die anyway through the extinction of the various species concerned.

We're bad at real and honorable citizenship. We don't talk about so many issues of importance. We love our shows and sports and anything besides politics and economics.

Quarantines always leak; the classic case of Mary Mallon (aka Typhoid Mary) resuming work as a cook (and spreading more typhoid) merely by changing her name applies here as well but only on a larger scale.

One other questions occurs to me.  How did the Chinese learn 2019-nCoV even existed?  They must have had a concern based on their experience with SARS.  And what surveillance system exists in our country's CDC what with the deliberate lurch of our current administration away from science?"

Our country is not in good shape to fight this coronavirus. We have millions of people with no health insurance. We have millions more who can't afford their deductible or co-pay.

What about the fact that the origin of this disease as well as most other flus is located in China’s wild animal meat markets as well as in its animal farming methods putting humans in close contact with farm animals. This has been known for decades and the Chinese no longer have the excuse that they are poor backward country. The main thing backward in China today is the government."

2020-01-30 1:42,"It is both curious and instructive  how authoritarian regimes (or authoritarian wannabees) handle these types of crises ... the lying ... the silencing of the truth tellers ... the sheer obviousness of the cover-up.

Did Xi really think that no one was going notice a break out of a deadly virus? Did Gorbachev and the Central Committee think that no one would notice the world's worst nuclear disaster at Chernobyl? Does Trump and the Republican Party really believe they can cover up climate change indefinitely? That no one will notice the eventual relocation of millions of people from coastal areas, the unending wildfires and all the rest? 

In two out of three cases mentioned above we are talking about intelligent leaders who are not easily fooled. Even domestically, the fool in the Oval Office and those in Congress have access to the truth.  Ultimately the cover-up isn't really about convincing people that what they can see with their own eyes isn't happening. It isn't even always about money. 

It's just authoritarians (and our domestic wannabees) reasserting their power to replace facts with fictions, replace thought and learning with blind obedience, and to define reality as they see fit always ready to attack those who dare to speak the obvious.

2020-01-30 16:29,"As far as I am concerned, the horse escaped the barn long ago and it isn't completely the fault of China.  If this virus really does have such a long--but apparently infectious--incubation period, so many people would be infected before knowing it, spread it around similar to other virus infections (who here can say they always stay home when they are sick?!), and may have recovered without ever knowing they had a coronavirus infection.  They may have just though it was another upper respiratory virus. And since it is possible that many people were actually never sick enough to warrant medical intervention, just coping with their illness with tea and sympathy.  

The current fatality rate is around 2% which is lower than the 2019 U.S. flu rate of 2.6%.  Not to downplay death but if there are many people with limited symptoms that weren't diagnosed with coronavirus, the fatality rate may actually be lower.  Fast spreading viruses are scary, especially with modern global reach, but let us just practice standard methods for prevention an infection.  Wash your hands frequently and do't go out when you are sick.  But mainly WASH YOUR HANDS!

We just don't know yet."
2020-01-30 16:40,"In addition to the points raised in Mr. Kristof’s article, China should be severely reprimanded for allowing conditions to exist that promote the inter species exchange of virulent pathogens and their concomitant potential for creating novel and potentially deadly disease.  China has long been on notice that its trade in illegal wildlife as well as its handling and processing of exotic fauna in the name of gastronomic delicacies poses a severe and wholly foreseeable risk of creating the situation the world finds Itself in today.  Even if Chinese officials somehow missed the implication of SARS in 2002-2003, how could they not recognize what eventually became a common, even stereotypic, scenario for the creation of a deadly virus with the potential for killing millions worldwide?  See, e.g., the Hollywood movie Contagion which made crystal clear the wholly foreseeable risk posed by wet markets.  Such markets bring together normally disparate species under one roof creating what amounts to a unique, man-made laboratory for the creation of new, exotic, and potentially super-deadly viruses.  China should get its act together and stop these practices.  If raping the natural world is not sufficient incentive, one would think the disease and death of its own citizens would be."

He’s a preening dictator, and with this outbreak some citizens are paying a price.""

Doing anything about the dictatorship in China is a ship that has long since sailed.   In years past forward thinking individuals in the US have claimed the US has no business interfering in the internal affairs of the PRC.  Western powers had done that for over a century and we were informed those days were over.  The PRC  was and remains a dictatorship.  The opening of relations with China and its integration into the world economy was hailed as a step forward for the world in general. But no one should have expected anything different than the governance model we see in place today.

We have the China we have and no one should have expected anything different.  That includes the citizens of Hong Kong.  Any transient observations you had should have been understood to be short lived - your surprise in 2003 notwithstanding.

""Education"" and ""criticism"" have been tools used by the PRC for years, actually for as long as I can remember.  I used to complain about those actions  but that was labelled  ""Cold Warrior"" rhetoric.  I was an active participant in Cold War V1.0.  I'm sitting out Cold War V2.0 but am getting a good laugh at all the ""Oh the humanity"" rhetoric.

But you did get in a dig at Trump and Bloomberg so there's that."

It's also infuriating to learn how local officials were denied the right to speak, putting a huge blockade for free flow of information. 
International Communities should come together in condemning Xi's handling of Coronavirus and there should be accountability at global stage to let Beijing know its mistake. Such measures will send a strong message to all the countries to treat Coronavirus-like-situation in utmost transparency and emergency.

I would not ascribe to malice what can be ascribed to wishful thinking and ignorance. As @ACH has mentioned, China has moved fast in sequencing the genome and making it available to the worldwide community. I for one am astounded that the spread of the virus is as limited as it has been in a country of a billion plus people and travel to and from China is on an unprecedented scale."

The ineptitude and sheer ideological stupidity of that era is manifesting today.  And why not?  The political structure in power during that time is the same one in power today.  In the end none of what they do is about their people.  It is about maintaining their grip on Power.

And you're taking this opportunity to lob political criticisms at the Chinese government? You sound like Trump, except even Trump isn't using this crisis opportunistically.

How is the WORLD paying for China's dictatorship? Every single death has been in China. Chinese people are the ones suffering.

I don't even understand what your argument is. If China had a democratically elected government it would have acted more quickly? Our government has spent the last 10 years denying the existence of climate change, how's that for quick? 

""The government finally ordered a lockdown on Jan. 23 that effectively quarantined people in Wuhan. But by then, according to the mayor, five million people had already fled the city.""

You think they should have quarantined Wuhan when there were only 10 cases instead of waiting to see if it was an epidemic? That's making the case for more authoritarianism, not less. You think our government would quarantine New York City? Half the city would need to be infected to make something like that politically palatable.

""One reason for the early cover-up is that Xi’s China has systematically gutted institutions like journalism...""

2020-01-30 17:23,"Regarding the Wuhan doctor who was reprimanded for raising the alarm in December : I immediately thought of Dr Bennett Omalu, whose career was destroyed by the NFL when he published research on Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy in football players. Our government stood aside and said nothing, even though thousands of children, teenagers, and college students continue to play this dangerous sport. Or the years when the CDC has been forbidden to compile statistics on gunshot wounds as a cause of death, in this case because our government acts as an enforcer for the NRA. There's plenty of blame to go around when this type of thing occurs. I agree with ACH from Berkeley, who argues for a bit of perspective."

It also acts to muzzle or discredit scientific consensus about the dangers of rising temperatures and the millions of climate refugees that will inevitably result, all for the short term economic gains in fossil fuel industry. Even now, the current administration is attempting to punish the entire state of California for its more stringent auto emissions standards. 

And then there was the decades long controversy about whether or not tobacco use causes cancer, when the medical professionals and other activists had to fight the government to act. Again, our government sided for years with the tobacco industry against the welfare of the people, just as it now sides with the NRA to prevent sensible gun legislation."
2020-01-30 3:07,"Mr. Kristof, 

It's always easier to say what should've been done retrospectively, than what to do when you are actually at that point making decisions. 

I'm all for free speech and the free flow of information. But sometimes this type of ""freeness"" has its shortcomings - it also allows the free flow of MIS-information. We have certainly experienced this during the 2016 election, where misinformation was spread perhaps faster than the virus today, and worse, with no gatekeeping insight (some would call it, censorship), which was exploited by the Russians. 

I'm no fan of an autocratic government, nor that I think punishing news breakers is right. What I can only guess is - when no one understood what this new virus really was at the moment, what one can do is to stop the news becoming a rumor unless we know the magnitude and the impact for sure. Otherwise, causing panic in the public without solid confidence would only make things worse. 

We did see the Chinese government share the genetic profile of the coronavirus, the daily countdown of infection, etc., after they understood the problem better. They shouldn't be praised for doing what they are supposed to do, but it's certainly missing in this article. 

On the contrary to our media, the news organizations here compete to be the FIRST to break the news. Therefore, I think your article is one-sided and partial, as if the outbreak happens in a free country, the situation would be much better. Would it though?"
2020-01-30 2:54,"This is a cautionary tale for our own country.  When Nicholas Kristof points out that leaders who surround themselves with yes men and flatterers aren't in touch with what's really happening, he whows what that leads to: chaos and an inability to stop a growing crisis.

The role for good journalism and agents of accountability has never been higher in an era where these items are becoming ever-scarcer.

I dread contemplating what we'll face here if disaster decides to hit, given an eerie similarity between the  disdain for journalism and science  shown by President Xi and that of our own president."

I beg to differ.  Cordoning off such a large population and taking decisive measures to limit the mingling of people, building hospitals in a matter of days, and apparently trying to contain the virus as best as they can is certainly not an indecisive action.  All written for Xi holds but they are trying hard."

They repeated my e-mail conversations back to me and imitated my physical mannerisms.  Etc.  You try that on for comfort when you compare the US to them.  A totalitarian communist state is no joking matter.  As for the premise that Xi gets bad information.  He wanted to become a member of the Communist Party so bad that he applied 8 times.  He wants what he's getting in some respects.  And empirically, this has happened before.  Mao starved at least 30 million people to death during the Great Leap Forward.  He confiscated nearly all the grain produced by his agricultural commune system, including seed for the next crop, because cadres kept overestimating the size of the crop to please him.  But he knew the consequences and refused to return surplus grain because he wanted to trade or sell it overseas for military and industrial equipment.  He knew this was happening.  You people who think this is a respectable political party are fools or willful propagandists for communism.  In the 21st century, who in their right mind stands up for this system anymore?

2020-01-30 18:06,"The following is from today's South China Morning Post.  It should be noted that no panic resulted when the outbreak was reported.  Disorganization maybe but not panic.

Responding to criticism that authorities in Wuhan, the epicentre of the outbreak in central China, were slow to inform the public about the illness, Zeng Guang, from the Chinese Centre for Disease Control and Prevention, said government officials always had to factor in political stability.
“They need to consider economic factors, and issues like family reunions over the Lunar New Year. So what we [scientists] said was only part of their considerations,” tabloid Global Times quoted Zeng as saying on Wednesday.
Critics and internet users in China have said that the Wuhan government was too slow to respond, focusing on the illness as “preventable and controllable” until it became too widespread.
Zeng stressed that he was not criticising the municipal government, but said lessons should be learned and science should carry more weight in such decisions.
“If a scientific perspective is not given sufficient weight, other considerations will be meaningless,” he said.
Wuhan mayor Zhou Xianwang told state television on Monday that he waited for approval from more senior officials to release updates.

The director-general of the World Health Organization (WHO) said on Wednesday that China deserves the international community's gratitude and respect for having taken very serious measures to contain the novel coronavirus outbreak and prevent exporting cases overseas.

Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus thanked the Chinese government for the extraordinary steps it has taken to prevent the spread of the new coronavirus.

Tedros reiterated that almost 99 percent of cases and all deaths have been within China, with only 68 confirmed cases and no deaths in 15 countries and regions outside China. ""For that, China deserves our gratitude and respect ... China is implementing very serious measures and we cannot ask for more,"" he said.

The WHO chief returned to Geneva on Wednesday from China and thanked China for having identified the pathogen in a short time and shared it immediately, which has led to the rapid development of diagnostic tools.
""China has been completely committed to transparency, both internally and externally, and has agreed to work with other countries that need support.

I generally find your articles informative but I don’t agree with your assessment of the situation in China nor your criticisms of President Xi. I’m not his fan but it’s getting so tiring to read the endless NYT articles bashing China and its reactions to this virus. For example, you stated in a response to another comment that 5 million had fled Wuhan. You do realize those people were part of the annual mass migration for the Chinese New Year holiday. To state that they fled implied public panic. And didn’t another NYT article state those who punished the whistleblowers were reprimanded by the Chinese court?  Please don’t be a part of the problem with providing misinformation. It doesn’t help. You’ve left China so long ago that I don’t think you have its heartbeat.

What sort of political system is that calls a doctor on the hot seat for talking publicly about a potential epidemic disease, esp. when it was one that had broken out in 2002?  Chernobyl.  That comes to mind.  This is a government that claims to be achieving utopian universal equality, but has to shut down its people because they don't believe that it will happen.  Thirty million dead in a famine.  Remember that.

“It might have been a fortunate thing if the public had believed the ‘rumour’ then and started to wear masks and carry out sanitisation measures, and avoid the wild animal market,” the judge said, referring to a market believed by some scientists to be the source of the outbreak in Wuhan.
Zeng also said he supported Wuhan’s decision to lock down the city, adding that it was an effective way to stop further transmission of the virus.
“We shall be able to see a turning point around ... [February 8],” he said. “If that turning point appears, we will have to thank the people of Wuhan.”
Zhou said that despite the public outcry about the lockdown he stood by the decision and was prepared to pay a professional price for it.

1.  The most rigorous study so far (published in The Lancet medical journal) shows the FIRST KNOWN CASE of 2019-nCoV was NOT exposed to the Huanan Market. 

2.  The fact that China's only bsl-4 lab happens to be in the virus epicentre could be a coincidence, but... 

3.  The fact that the Wuhan institute of Virology was researching Novel Bat Coronavirus is a 'coincidence' that stretches credibility. 

4.  In 2017, international scientists expressed concern about the Wuhan lab and China's lack of expertise/transparency in handling deadly pathogens.

2020-01-30 18:08,"And the parallels to our own nation under Donald Trump are obvious and chilling. Everything that occurs, and every opinion expressed by anyone is judged by one criterion: does it help Donald Trump? This is what being a textbook sociopath is all about. The terrifying part is that this pathetic shell of a man: refractory liar, racist, serial sex offender, demagogue, aspiring autocrat, should now command not only a large mindless cult but one of our major Parties.
We have one chance to repudiate Trump and Trumpism  in November. God help us and our children if we fail."
2020-01-30 3:07,"""But we’re now seeing the dangers of Xi’s authoritarian model, for China and the world.""

Perhaps you and your fellow journalists are just now seeing the dangers, but the rest of the world, especially China's neighbors, saw those dangers a long way off.  You all chose to ignore the ham-handed threats to Taiwan, the hauntingly familiar herding of Uighurs into concentration camps, the gruesome euthanizing and butchering of the involuntary Falun Gong organ donors, the aggressive and unapologetic spying, thievery, and bribery, and the militarism.  Rather than call it out, you all often embraced the Chinese Communist Party's explanations for their actions and you faulted our own leaders, our government, our workers, and what you regularly characterized as our own narrow-mindedness.

Only you could be surprised at China's inept mishandling of this outbreak."
2020-01-30 13:04,"""Preening dictator""  Perfect description."
2020-01-30 13:14,"Dear Nick, so, what else is new?  Although you make an important point, it is an old story.  The first nation that came roaring out of the great depression was Nazi Germany.  Dictatorships are often very efficient; it is their goals which are undesirable."
2020-01-30 14:20,"Please send this article to Mike Bloomberg. I don't think he'll get the Dem nomination, but then, I didn't think 63 million people were stupid enough to vote for Trump (and to still support him), and I want him to be aware of the despot running China."
2020-01-30 14:46,"Yeah, right! The US did such a great job of controlling AIDS back in the 80's."
2020-01-30 16:21,"Taiwan should be a permitted member of all international health organizations.

Why is it not? Xi and the Chinese ""Communist"" Party."
2020-01-30 13:18,"Stuff happens: No matter which political road you choose, especially in a huge country, mistakes will be legion and egregious. National embarrassments for England, Russia, Brazil, and America are countless.

Yes, China dropped the ball, hoist on its own petard.

But such mistakes are tragically unavoidable: The map you're using, whatever it is, will ineluctably take you into some rough patches. Now if we could only get our hands on a perfect map, say, Plato's Republic, but, no, that won't work either, which Socrates admits at the end of the thought experiment. Human governments are forever saddled with human fallibility. All we can do is remediation when the dam breaks, and it will.

Our problems are serious; our solutions, mediocre."
2020-01-30 3:10,"I think of Kristoff as The Times' columnist who's the heart of compassion and the activist of empathy.  His conviction is palpable: that the Human Condition isn't inevitable and if we see clearly and care we can change things and ease suffering everywhere.

That's why this column disappoints me.  Kristoff knows China. Instead of his insight into China's unique and unprecedented circumstance -- a population larger than all of Africa combined, with a modern history of political, social and economic development that's a fraction as long as America, facing headwinds of Western hostility, colonial oppression and cultural isolation laden with millennia of feudalism and dynastic rule -- Kristoff retreats to a stiff ideological view that isn't helpful, not in the face of a health emergency.

There is no precedent for China nor an ideal form of governance that's commensurate with the gargantuan challenges facing 1.2 to 1.6 billion Chinese.  The last time any Western nation attempted such a massive undertaking was British imperial rule of India, which ended in hasty retreat that left a lingering legacy of dysfunction, division and destitution. 

Arguably the only ""democratically elected"" leader more dangerous and devious than Trump is Modi.

Others have noted America's glaring public health crises -- opioids, AIDs, measles, obesity, gun violence, racism, tobacco, homelessness, military spending and war.  

We are a shining glass house on a hill. We can do better than throw stones."
2020-01-30 1:57,"Nicholas Kristof, bravo sir. This piece of journalism provides a welcome reminder that democracy still — with all of its faults — will always win out over a dictatorship. Thank you for the well-researched honesty. I took a big deep dive into the situation with the Uighur minority in Xingjiang as well, thanks to this piece."
2020-01-30 4:12,"I am surprised and disappointed to see Mr. Kristoff capitalizing on the coronavirus to make a factually false and logically unsound claim about the Chinese government. Not everything in China has to do with Xi Jinping! 

The Wuhan government did not make perfect decisions, but in rapidly identifying the virus as completely new, reporting it to the WHO, promptly shutting down the seafood market, closing the city right before China's largest holiday, and rapidly constructing two emergency hospitals, it has consistently shown the efficiency and evidence-based decision-making that few governments process. I challenge Mr. Kristoff to name one government that would perform better.

I read Chinese social media myself. And in spite of the NYTimes cherry-picked quotes about anger towards the government, I see overwhelming support towards the front-line medical workers, scientists and construction workers building the new hospitals. For every tweet against the government, there are a hundred more encouraging Wuhan, soliciting donations, and expressing hope."
2020-01-30 14:37,"In addition to your wise comments, the communists have a serious propaganda problem, because if Xi wears protective masks, they are saying, yes, he is also vulnerable, he is not God, and if he doesn't, then t the people would say: What? Is he stupid? And if he does not appear on any media or ceremony, then the people would say: Is he sick?  For a dictator this kind of situation is misery."
2020-01-30 20:10,The time has come for the international community to come together and ban all flights out of China.
2020-01-30 20:13,"W.H.O. tarried, but, finally spoke-up. Every moment is a defense from potential infection, epidemic and pandemic. South America and Africa have reported no incidents of Coronavirus, as yet. We pray none arrive there. The W.H.O action is welcome and must be taken seriously."
2020-01-30 20:10,"Too bad John Bolton got rid of the guy who was an expert at dealing with pandemics in this country.  There's no one in that position now, and the CDC has also lost needed funding under trump.  

I guess ""thoughts and prayers"" are in order now..."
2020-01-30 20:16,We need an International Block of any Flights to or from China.  We owe this to other Nations.
2020-01-30 20:22,Closed borders and no international flights. Abandoned airports. Slowing down trade. Sounds like the beginning of the 2020 Recession.
2020-01-30 20:23,I listened to the first couple W.H.O. conference videos when this first became a concern and thought it was odd how they would begin the update with 10 minutes of praise to the Chinese government about their handling and openness about the situation.  Quite strange and suspicious for what their priority should be.
2020-01-30 20:31,"Ross' statement, in addition to being extremely uncaring, is incorrect.  This epidemic has the potential to spread widely within the U.S., which would not be good for business ultimately.  This is why the stock market declined due to this news. 
 
If officials are going to comment, why not limit it to what we can do to prevent the spread of the virus, what kinds of preparations the U.S. is making, etc.  Preparation helps prevent panic and may help avoid the worst.  That's the job of these public servants.

Although washing your hands frequently seems like mundane advice, for some viruses it's quite good advice.  It might help the economy, selling more soap and hand sanitizer.  Though hand sanitizer doesn't work well and soap and water plus proper technique does.  This is a PSA from me.  Let's hear it from them plus more."
2020-01-30 20:33,"For those who suggest cutting off all transportation from China, do they also suggest prohibiting US residents from traveling anywhere because flu exists here?  Per CDC website, since Oct 2019 there have been over 15 million flu illnesses, 7 million  medical visits, 140,000  hospitalizations and more than 8200 deaths, just in the US.  The numbers suggest the flu is a much more prevalent and dangerous health risk to US residents and a little common sense and rational perspective is warranted."
2020-01-30 20:23,"So China did the right thing at beginning, locks down a mega city. 

2020 really didn’t start well for the world, too many bad things happened in the first month. Hope people no matter where they came from can learn to love and help each other and pass this hardness all together."
2020-01-30 20:48,"For people that show death rate compared to the ""flu' and say we are overreacting don't understand a few things.
1) Early in the risk assessment, the numbers suggest death rate is low, so okay, to soon
2) Why the virus mutation and transmission and death rate could change, too early to tell.   Since it is same family as MERs/SARS if it mutates to MERs like it could be a huge issue.   

Would you rather be safe or sorry, the costs to be safe are indeed high and we see China take that approach.  Or they may know something they aren't saying!"
2020-01-30 20:41,"The horse was out of the barn, so to speak, so China & WHO decided to throw in the kitchen sink. After all, flights were canceled and quarantines enacted. When all the bad news is out, any incremental improvement or even less bad is good news going forward. Smart play, really. The Chinese have learned from their failed stonewalling tactics with SARS"
2020-01-30 20:42,"Why isn’t the flu considered an international emergency? 

I bet you this years flu is going to kill far more people that this new virus."
2020-01-30 20:28,"Finally.
Now let’s all realize this is truly a big deal and, realistically and without panic, start dealing with it. Let us listen to the experts. Let us not listen to trump & co. This virus is not, and will not, be contained anytime soon. I welcome the day we have a trustworthy president who can lead with wisdom, great care, and a humble manner."
2020-01-30 20:47,"A bit of perspective:

In the US, the Centers for Disease Control influenza statistics estimates 9–45 million illnesses, 140–180,000 hospitalizations and 12–61,000 deaths annually since 2010.

At this moment, there’ve been around 8000 cases and some 180 deaths worldwide (but most or all in China) from the new corona virus over the past month.

Certainly, there’s reason for caution but not really a need for panic just yet. I definitely think we need to be vigilant but it kind of feels like the media might fueling some of the worry."
2020-01-30 21:09,Better safe than sorry? How effective will be the future control of spread after the W.H.O. declaration.
2020-01-30 21:15,"This had to happen simply because if it got out of control and they didn't then they would be held to account.  If they announce it and it turns out to be what it likely will end up being they can say their rapid response helped limit the spread.  Honestly it is a win/win so really hard to take anything from the announcement on its own.  Without being an expert but with looking at cases with previous related viruses this will likely run it's course and be the end of it (like SARS and MERS).  Obviously how contagious is a big difference but at this point healthy people are recovering, which is probably masking the true number that are sick.  If it hit healthy people hard it would be a much bigger problem."
2020-01-30 21:15,"coronavirus wasn't a zoonotic disease but after virus reassortment process , it has recognitioned in human body . Avian influenza virus can act much similar as coronavirus . we should find a way to prevent virus shifts that made them a dangerous type ."
2020-01-30 21:28,"Excellent report outlining the different meanings of a WTO declaration of global emergency. As for the epidemic itself, if it can be successfully subdued in time, it might bring many important positive changes."
2020-01-30 21:28,"It is self-evident China did not do the right thing quickly enough to contain this potential pandemic. In a dictatorship based on fear of severe reprisal for unprotected whistleblowers, saying something and doing the right thing in a timely manner is again, self-evidently impossible. 
I hope you also see the essential lesson for us here, in this moment? Especially if we intend to avoid becoming a dictatorship...?"
2020-01-30 21:29,"Bear in mind that the statistics we're reading are unreliable, and not for China's lack of trying.  Especially at this early stage of the outbreak, the numbers we're reading - 170 dead out of 8000 cases reported - are notoriously unreliable.  The 'cases reported' statistic especially, first because many cases go unreported when symptoms may be mild or even nonexistent.  As a result, the cases reported statistic - the denominator - is likely much larger, while deaths - the numerator - are, of course, much easier to discern and therefore report.  So it's likely that the rate of death is overstated and will fall.  Already it's lower than SARS.  This does not mean at all that governments should be complacent.  But it does mean we should consult reliable sources for information and, so far at least, exercise the reasonable, flu-prevention precautions that the CDC recommends."
2020-01-30 21:39,"I think the WHO is being realistically cautious. People are underestimating the strength and mortality rate of this virus. In China the number of cases and mortality rate is underestimated due to the lack of hospital beds and availability of testing kits. You do not get tested if you present with systems and they do not have a bed or hallway space for you. The people getting tested and support are those that can afford it in tier one hospitals. In other words the wealthy. 

I am likely that the cases will explode in the west and other parts of SEA as the virus has time to take hold in the millions of tourists from China traveling the world in holiday for the Lunar New Year."
2020-01-30 21:03,Looks like it's the Yeas of the Bat.
2020-01-30 21:07,"Some information from People's Daily:
""The latest 7 new cases in Beijing, cumulative diagnosis of 121 cases. From 8 am to 2 pm on January 30, 7 new cases of pneumonitis infected with new coronavirus were added to Beijing, 2 of which had contact history in Hubei and other provinces, and 5 were close contacts of confirmed cases, all of which have been sent to the city Designated medical institutions for treatment.

The effects of traffic regulations will be felt in the coming days
Traffic control creates a barrier between the source of infection and healthy people, blocking the spread of the virus. The epidemic data may be worrying, but imagine that if no measures are taken, there may be several ""Wuhan"" in the country."""
2020-01-30 20:56,still will cause less harm than viral fake news on facebook
2020-01-30 21:01,A week too late.  How many more people got sick and how many more will die?  You did not have to be an expert to see this coming.  They were too concerned with the politics to actually save lives.
2020-01-30 21:14,"What power does the W.H.O. have over nominal scientific, technological, diplomatic and military sovereign nation states like China and Russia to deal with the coronavirus by declaring this emergency?"
2020-01-30 20:56,What scares me is the total incompetence on display daily of the Trump administration. Sooner or later smart people have predicted a crisis somewhere that Trump will have to deal with and now he has successfully surrounded himself with sycophants and people as unqualified and incompetent as he is. Could this become that crisis? I don’t know but what I do know is that it could be and I have no confidence in our current administration to handle it.
2020-01-30 21:24,"If the best that we have for our survival is hand washing and face masks then we are in big trouble.

China is the epicenter of this pandemic.

It is rapidly spreading elsewhere. Today cases were announced in the United Arab Emirates. Soon it will be playing in a location near you.

There is no treatment.

Many people will die.

Our vaunted healthcare system is powerless to deal with this tiny virus that is killing so many people."
2020-01-30 21:30,Finally. WHO has been praising China for their swift action. Since when WHO is also controlled by China! Should have declared global emergency days ago!
2020-01-30 21:23,"This took far too long. Also members of WHO going on about how great China has been to how they have been transparent was  a joke. When I think of transparency, I don't think of China jailing journalists trying to bring attention to this virus. I don't think of the local government being blamed for following the national government's protocol. I don't think of the government creating an environment of fear for speaking up how things are worse than what is being reported. Their fawning for Xi and the CCP was disgraceful. Having said that, at least they finally took action since the incubation and human to human transmission is a grave concern."
2020-01-30 21:15,"Compared to a list of a scores (hundreds?) of other diseases and maladys causing people to get sick and / or die, the statistics on this are not alarming in the least.

Can someone please explain why this is more than filler for a slow news cycle?"
2020-01-30 21:29,"I don't understand the problem. 61,000 people died of the flu in the US alone in 2018 according to this source- <a href=""https://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/burden/2017-2018.htm"" target=""_blank"">https://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/burden/2017-2018.htm</a>/

Compare that to the 171 that have died worldwide so far from coronavirus. So why the panic?"
2020-01-30 21:03,"As a physician I just don't see how the facts match the hysteria.  So far all we know is that 100 people out of 2 billion have died.  Last year alone 34,000 people died in the USA from the flu according to the CDC. Yes 34k! Our hysteria is really displaced.  Until we get more information about the Corona virus, we should just chill and protect ourselves from the flu."
2020-01-30 21:10,Coronavirus as if I needed another reason not to eat bat.
2020-01-30 21:40,We were just at a hospital in Northern California and a Chinese family believes one of their members has the virus and the entire family wanted to be checked out. This virus is here now. If this virus is spreading so easily how do we not know now these hospitals might be infected. There needs to be more information by our government about this. Should we move our family member out of this hospital immediately?
2020-01-30 21:48,"I just went to the clinic to get a routine lab test.  Before I could get the test, I was instructed to put on a mask for the duration of the process.  We have a county-wide order for that in force in Santa Clara County, CA.  I specifically asked if it was because of the coronavirus from Wuhan and the answer was, ""Yes."""
2020-01-30 21:45,"Since I was a boy, when I understood what the human population growth curve was, I have been aware that life cannot sustain itself according to this data. So what will give? Will we really end up with 30, 40, 50 billion people on this planet? I think not. I think that is beginning to play out now. Climate disasters, unchecked disease (whether it’s Coronavirus or the next, more invasive and deadly one) habitat competition. That the US is currently led by persons who see they have a way out of this that we regulars don’t, or they are just blind, plain stupid (which is their front now), doesn’t really matter. That they don’t give a gosh darn about anything other than their self interest, that’s enough for me to at least determine who the ‘enemy’ is. They don’t live in far lands, with exotic needs (you know, a roof, adequate nutrition, education for their kids and some sense of personal safety - you know, exotic), no they live right under your noses..

So the guy who writes this article: sure don’t panic. Do a whhatsboutism with it and ignore the fact that the underlying disease is not the threat. It’s that the next one and the kne after that will, sooner or later, in a cull of large proportions. Blame the deniers, the minimizers, the stupid."
2020-01-30 21:46,"The SARS (coronavirus) outbreak took 1,150 lives in total, worldwide.  Influenza has taken between 12,000 – 61,000 deaths annually since 2010, in the USA alone! 

Is the coronavirus a big deal?  

Kinda, but this is being blown WAY out of proportion."
2020-01-30 22:01,"Just think in eight months if this spreads we may be in the midst of a global pandemic, complete with a global economic recession and closed borders worldwide. This definitely could have a huge effect on the election, with Trump wielding emergency powers during the election."
2020-01-30 22:07,"I wish I shared the optimism of the posters claiming this is less damaging than the flu. From my perspective, I’m afraid it’s an order of magnitude greater. The flu doesn’t kill 1% - this year I believe fatalities are 0.006% - infectious, but not as deadly. By contrast, this new virus has now reported 172 deaths out of more than 8,000 cases - that’s a fatality rate of more than 2%. It appears to spread extremely rapidly and of course, the population has no immunity. The real fear of pandemics is that they overwhelm and crash the very medical systems that are designed to provide us protection. This appears to be happening in Wuhan - hospitals are turned to sites of cross-contamination. As for the magnitude, 2% may not sound like much - until you apply it to the American population of 327 million. 2% would kill 6.5 million Americans, overwhelm our healthcare system and spread panic and economic stagnation. God forbid that should happen. For my part, I’m just hoping that China and the WHO’s response is strong enough."
2020-01-30 21:59,"The coronavirus crisis is exacerbated by the Chinese government’s withholding or suppressing of vital information necessary to limit the virus’s spread.  

As the virus has already reached our shores, what confidence can we have as Americans that the misleader-in-chief and his corrupt administration will be truthful with us about this evolving pandemic?  Especially, God-forbid, if that information is damaging to “trump’s economy” or his re-election campaign."
2020-01-30 22:22,"And what is the Grifter’s plan to make America safe from this virus?
Not a word yet but rest assured that when he travels to Iowa tonight, he will not mention it."

2020-01-30 22:00,"People saying about the flu kills more people than anything... yes it’s true but....
I’m pretty sure they have the flu in Wuhan as well but they don’t shut down the entire city full of millions of people. Maybe this a lot worse than what Chinese government is telling you. Or what our doctors here in the US who have not even seen this virus yet are saying. China is very advanced now so this should be taken seriously. It seems there was way more people initially infected before we even were told about the situation."
2020-01-30 22:16,"As an ardent reader and active participant in the column for comments of The New York Times about one and a half decade, I could experience the contribution of NYT has been praiseworthy in alerting the concerned whenever there is an outbreak of the virus of Ebola,Corona or any other natural disaster in any part of the world.
On the day of outbreak of Corona virus,the probabilities of the carriers highlighted by interacting with the scientists who are on the research to pinpoint the source of this corona virus, 
Bamboo cats (impressive you tube) ,bats,snakes -- by NYT was a main thread to further research on the subject.
When we caution about the tape worm in an inadequately boiled meat of a pig, why don't the scientific community review the mode of cooking of many of the items starting from cockroach,bamboo cat to big cat for the safe heaven of the virus that is cataclysmic threat to the human life on the planet. Need of the hour is a research on the various incubators of the deadly virus in the animal kingdom who are tempting the inhabitants of the land of the origin of the virus as a source of delicious for dining  in its form but destructive  in its function."
2020-01-30 22:21,Hopefully the appropriate global responses are not politicised now that the WHO have taken this step and that medical and associated subject matter experts are left to do their jobs without blockages and interference.
2020-01-30 22:04,"This epidemic doesn't scare me.

My fellow americans scare me, particularly the ones in Washington DC employed by the government.

For the past three years, despite 50 million americans being without health insurance they have tried to add another 25 million to the uninsured ranks by repealing the affordable care act. Only the lonely thumbs down of John McCain saved those people and we lost him.

The other group of Americans that scare me work for the media. They constantly present the idea of America having a system similar to Germany, France or the Netherlands as ""Communism"" The call second tier candidates blatantly pandering to big insurance for the cash they have to offer — ""moderates.""

I'm sorry but the time for universal healthcare was several decades ago and we have just been skimming along on luck and a prayer for the past half century.

If there really is a serious pandemic (this doesn't look like te one) our system is so riddled with holes, with tens of millions falling through the safety net that, well come on — it won't hold up in a real emergency, even if we had intelligent people in government who understood the science, and we don't do we?

The fear being generated here is from a very sound understanding of the american system by the american people themselves. We know we haven't done right by each other, and we know we aren't going to. We just never thought we'd have to pay a price for it."
2020-01-30 22:27,"A woman returned to Chicago from China on January 13. She showed symptoms of coronavirus 3 or 4 days after her return and was hospitalized on January 24.  Today January 30 it was announced her husband has symptoms.   So I infer that this disease has almost a 2 week incubation period.   

Many people think the seasonal flu kills 1 percent of those it infects.  That is not true.  The flu kills .1 percent.  That means one in one thousand sick people will die.  

The coronavirus kills 2 percent of those infected.  That means 2 in one hundred, or 20 in one thousand will die.  So the coronavirus is 20 times worse than regular flu."
2020-01-30 22:29,"Abolish, not just temporarily close, live animal markets. WHO must work with China to educate the population that buying and eating rare and endangered animals doesn't promote virility or indicate high economic status, but rather spreads serious illness!"
2020-01-30 22:38,"There is no way to contain this to China. This one or the next one. Just like the common cold or the flu, the transmission is not in the air, it is when it is on a hand, the hand touches something, and then another hand touches the same thing.  How many Chinese hand prints are all over almost every consumer item. We are so dependent on world trade, from phones to food ingredients. So, we are all in this together. And it is time to face that, and be thankful the Chinese Government is sharing info and asking assistance of the CDC. Now we have to hope that our own medical researchers have not been too diminished by the retreat in funding and support of our GOP controlled government."

2020-01-30 22:35,"The WHO calls this virus ""Novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV)"" as the official name. By calling this ""Wuhan coronavirus"" you are perpetuating a false name, false information, and fanning the flames of xenophobia."
2020-01-30 22:36,"And why does the WHO still show China as very high risk and the rest of the world as ""at risk?"""
2020-01-30 22:23,"I grew up in an era where we thought we knew all the infectious diseases. Then we had Legionnaires. Then AIDS, Ebola, Marburg, SARS, and others. Nature is firing shots across the bow of humanity.  We would do well to take everything seriously, because we hav no idea what is going to come next, and one of these will have a high infection rate, a high mortality, and all the money in the world won't help a bit. It's one way nature controls population."
2020-01-30 22:34,"We have a person who is currently quarantined in a local Las Vegas hospital that may be infected.  LV has a large Chinese population and an international airport with millions of Asian visitors each year, that isn't being monitored for the coronavirus.  It's only a matter of time before the virus spreads everywhere.  Very frightening in so many ways (health, world economics, etc).

Forget about a nuclear bomb ending the world, a rouge virus will do the trick nicely."
2020-01-30 22:55,"Wonder what our leaders are doing at such a critical time other than wasting time on an impeachment case that was a lost case from the get go. 

Need to take the measures to prevent the spread the virus. Need to ramp up manufacturing of masks, hazmat suits, protective supplies.  Researchers should be working around the clock to find a vaccine. Need to think about the manufacturing and supply chain for the vaccine. Need to anticipate disruptions to food supply and critical supplies. Need to anticipate overloading of medical facilities. What is the US government doing today to protect the American people and to help people in China and elsewhere? 

The media is not even reporting that more than 1300 passengers are in critical condition, which is in the minutes of WHO meeting today. Wonder if our government is aware we live in year 2020, and we expect better performance on dealing with epidemics."
2020-01-30 22:49,Is there any way to guesstimate the real number of deaths? We only hear China’s official stats—we know they’re fudged. Don’t we have any spies over there? Any intel?
2020-01-30 22:59,I have  a feeling that this virus has been around much longer than the Chinese Government is acknowledging. A friend from Hong Kong told me that there were rumors of a new virus in mainland China as far back as the end of October and beginning of November. This virus has had a huge head start. I fear that what we're seeing in Canada and other countries around the world in just the tip of an incredibly dangerous ice berg.
2020-01-30 23:05,"The last WHO situation report (#10) on the coronavirus was updated just after midnight on the 30th, here: <a href=""https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/situation-reports"" target=""_blank"">https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/situation-reports</a>. 
the risks are still listed as high risk in China and at risk for the rest of the world. No global emergency here

The current CDC report shows 92 untested samples. On the 29th, it was 73, as it was the day before"
2020-01-30 23:05,Why no references to the fact that Tedros praised China’s prompt actions to limit the spread and reiterated that WHO is opposed to any trade or travel restrictions???
2020-01-30 21:38,"Why the article does not mention the death rate is pretty typical of useless fear mongering.  My best guess yesterday was about 1 to 2 percent. Highish but not panic worthy. The real value the Chinese authorities and the rest of the living things on the planet may reap from this will be a long overdue willingness of Asians to accept a crackdown on ""wild meats"" and accept rules about not ingesting everything that creeps, crawls, and wiggles if it some crackpot claims it enhances beauty or sexual virility.  If they want to be members of the first world, then they can darn well learn to exist on a diet of high-fructose corn syrup like the rest of us!"
2020-01-30 20:50,"Oh my, by my count we now have the following emergencies:

Health
Climate
Political
Trust
Economic Inequality
Truth

I'm sure I'm missing some, can you think of more?"
2020-01-30 20:04,"And Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross says this is good for the US economy.  

As a nurse of many decades, his words are inhumane and indicative of the demeanor of our current administration."
2020-01-30 20:30,My heart goes out to the Chinese people.
2020-01-30 23:46,Quick thought- will air filters in all the planes that provided transportation to/from and within China  be  changed or disinfected? Not just a 'cleaning' of the interior of the plane?  Viruses have an ability to survive on surfaces.
2020-01-30 23:56,"I don't buy it. such drastic measures for what? so, there is a virus. we survived lots  of them. this is more politics and over the top news cycle  than health ."
2020-01-30 23:32,"Wow, Dr. W.H.O. that took quite a long time."
2020-01-31 0:02,"The South China Morning Post( HK’s lead newspaper) just reported an increase in the confirmed case total to 9480 from the previous 8,236 and more importantly the death total jumped from 171 to 213. This 42 death increase is significant because the total had been at 171 for a few days.

Not good at all!"
2020-01-30 23:21,Why does this whole thing sound like the plotline from the movie Contagion. Hearts and prayers with China and all of us.
2020-01-30 23:46,"And 8,000 people have already died in this country of ""regular"" flu just this season."
2020-01-30 23:54,I'm just here for the xenophobic trolls
2020-01-30 20:54,"Watch the documentary Pandemic on Netflix

It speaks of exactly what is happening right now in China

<a href=""https://www.netflix.com/title/81026143"" target=""_blank"">https://www.netflix.com/title/81026143</a>"
2020-01-31 0:19,People who compare the threat to modern flu outcomes where we have treatments and immunizations must have graduated from Trump University. Coronavirus is like the flu in terms of symptoms and fatalities but without the treatments or immunizations available. That means pandemic coronavirus today is like pandemic flu in 1918 when 30% of the world population was infected and 10% of those died.
2020-01-30 21:30,"As ever, let’s hope the dopey Republicans and especially their leaders, get this. Don’t worry censors, I mean I hope they understand.. You know.. they get it. But good."
2020-01-31 0:06,"Well you can rank the response of the governments by the rate of their infections.  

Thailand with 14 cases of infection; Japan, 11; Hong Kong and Singapore, 10; Taiwan, eight; Australia, Malaysia, and Macau, each with seven; France, five; South Korea, Germany, and the United Arab Emirates, each with four; Canada, three; Vietnam, two; and India, the Philippines, Nepal, Cambodia, Sri Lanka, and Finland, each with one.

It would be good if they compete to keep the numbers down."
2020-01-31 0:18,"It's a man-made disaster created by the Chinese Communists trying hard to suppress info about the outbreak, arresting doctors who just shared info among private online circles. It was further exacerbated by the a WHO that has been basically bought off by the Chinese government and fought its own experts tooth and nail to delay the warning. The water is also muddied by Western media, exemplified by this report, that never take the above parties to task on their behaviors. These Western media that have been cowed by the Chinese government's denying of access or simply gone gaga over the Chinese government because of their own leftist leanings.
It's high time for us to realize the evil nature of the Chinese government and cut it off from the civilized world. It's high time for us to do away with cultural relativism that has done so much damage for over half a century and purify international organizations' top leaderships of corrupt officials from non-democratic nations."
2020-01-30 21:15,"Containment has failed and since the virus is contagious from asymptomatic person to asymptomatic person during the pathogen's incubation period, containment efforts are too little too late as the virus has spread to every province in the PRC which has a population of 1.3 billion.  Anyone who rationally thinks the virus can be contained to mainland china is simply foolish as flights from China continue to land all over the globe.   Waiting until you have confirmed cases to embargo travel is like closing the door to the barn after the horses have left.  Screening people at airports for fevers is better than nothing, but given the 14 day incubation period when persons are infected but subacute or asymptomatic, it is like putting one's finger into a dyke to stop a leak while all around you water flows under and over the dyke.  Unfortunately, no nation is prepare to shut down commerce to contain a virus even if they could enforce such restrictions.  In the US, the people flown back from Wuhan are only be quarantined for 3 days which is madness given the incubation period.  Tests for viral loads yield false positives and false negatives and are never dispositive in regard to the presence of a pathogen in an infected host."
2020-01-30 21:59,"Don’t worry, under King Lord Trump, he’ll be able to shut things down in the US at will. Maybe he’ll colonize diseased people from the border, further ghettoize some democrat leaning city, and then
let the colony go in the new ghetto? Just saying."
2020-01-31 0:20,Trump said is was only a little headache and snuffy nose no big deal.
2020-01-31 0:28,"The comments seeking to trivialize the danger make very little sense.

Does anyone really believe that the Chinese Government with the most data and the closet to the actual situation would have taken the drastic measures it has undertaken and suffered the damage to its economy and worldwide embarrassment  if this were not a clear and present danger--a deadly threat?"
2020-01-31 0:48,"Here in the Philippines, the President just recently banned the flights from Wuhan today. The first case was confirmed yesterday (A Chinese mainlander from Wuhan who have just died travelled to three different places.) Most of the population already demanded a travel ban since the start of the confirmed case from China as it is a given prerogative in our constitution (Art. 3, Section 6, 1987 Constitution) but the whole administration including most of its sycophantic believers from Congress are hesitant because it seems that they do not want to offend their treasonous diplomatic partnership that has already cost us our islands in the West Philippine Sea. 

It will just be another class war between the poor and those who are privileged considering the state of our healthcare and our government that cares more for their Chinese diplomacy."
2020-01-31 0:51,"So why didn’t Donald Trump immediately stop the Planes from coming to the United States. If Obama had been President, citizen Trump would have been tweeting up a storm on the first day demanding all Planes from China be stopped. Trump as President made a conscious decision to weigh the economic cost of a travel ban with all possible outcomes and advised by his medical specialist decided There was no reason to ban chinese visitors and their deep pockets , In other words he took an educated gamble. If the a virus takes off in the United States and panic and economic turmoil is the result Trump will be blamed. The presidency is like a ship at sea, when the weather changes and the sea gets bumpy everyone looks to the Captain. The wars of the future will not be between humans, but between humans and microbes, and if we don’t get smart and proactive , and pick the most educated leaders the human race doesn’t stand a chance."
2020-01-31 0:58,Another United Nations related organization that is now obsolete.
2020-01-31 1:05,"The WHO has lately been showing a very troubling tendency of favoritism toward a certain government - first by endorsing questionable traditional medicine, and now by soft pedaling the appropriate response to the coronavirus."
2020-01-31 1:18,"The ordinary flu kills at least 12,000 people each year in the U.S., and at least 290,000 people worldwide. If some new virus comes along and kills a few thousand people, it causes a worldwide panic (and perhaps rightfully so, since we have a flu vaccine and we do not yet have a coronavirus vaccine). But I think it is appropriate for the WHO to give a measured response, rather than a hysterical one."
2020-01-31 1:28,"Green, Yellow, & Red warnings are apparently instantly understood due to the popularity of the game of soccer. 
Overall I am impressed by the international role soccer plays.  About the closest thing to an army Uruguay has is its soccer team.  I admire Uruguay because it is much like what old hippies believed the United States would be by now.
Anyway all nations of any legitimacy do two things: Defend and Educate.  Defense from disease is as profound a duty as defense from invading armies.  
I am sorry for those who have contracted this disease or many other diseases.
It is life changing and miserable to lose friends and relations from aggressive and mysterious diseases and our international cooperations ought mimic cooperations between national postal services."
2020-01-31 2:01,"New York had a totally preventable  measles outbreak due to ineffective vaccination. Yet when a new virus which closely resembles the common flu strikes,  posters here expect China to have identified and contained the virus within days."
2020-01-31 1:49,This is mother nature's remedy for overpopulation and disrespect for the planet by the human species. Let mother nature work her course.
2020-01-31 1:12,"For all the comments about how many Influenza deaths we have compared to this Wuhan coronavirus...and that we are panicking for nothing. Etc. 

Please keep in mind those flu deaths result from people who refuse to get vaccinated or are seriously health compromised. There is some personal responsibility in that. 

This novel coronavirus is new so responsible citizens can’t get vaccinated to protect themselves and their society. 

Which means that the irresponsible Chinese government put humans beings lives at risk, including non Chinese citizens and we the responsible citizens of the world who do get vaccines have no way of protecting ourselves other than to restrict all travel to and from China. This should have been done 2 weeks ago. 

The Chinese caused this, and this is not a trivial matter. 
The W.H.O should not be pandering to the Chinese communist party leaders and their economic needs."
2020-01-31 1:14,I believe the operative phrase is “kow towing”
2020-01-31 1:04,"Countries making decisions (to bar travelers from China, is this case) not based on science, but panic and potential underlying xenophobia?! Utterly shocking."
2020-01-31 1:14,"China is regularly found to be dealing in illegal animal parts, for 'traditional' medicine that address such things as virility.  So, elephant ivory, rhino horns, etc. are often found in Chinese markets.  The government does nothing about this. One quarter of the world's pigs, were infected with African Swine flu virus, which started in China, but also spread to other parts of the world.  This virus jumped from wild animals to humans, yet no one is screaming about the fact that these live markets, continue in China.  I have been to China, every single day was a challenge, trying to find safe food, trying to avoid being spat upon, trying to walk around people defecating on the street...yes, in Beijing and Shanghai. If the W.H.O. is going to declare an emergency, then they have to address these issues and hold the Chinese government to account.  Animals in these markets are held in horrible conditions, these need to be shut down.  And this extends to other countries, where over crowded Chinatowns flout local laws.  It's not enough to take people's temperatures, there have to be efforts to educate and stop allowing the torture of animals for human consumption."
2020-01-31 1:22,"The level of hysteria, conspiracy theories, and outright nuttiness in some comments is perhaps more frightening than the unknowns of the CoronaVirus.  Every year in the world the flu kills between 300K and 600K; U.S. figures are about 60K annually. The Corona flu has been around about two months and has killed about 200 people. Will it get worse?  Probably, sadly, but thus far, we see no reason for outright terror. Someone here brought up the flu of 1918 which killed about 50,000,000 people worldwide. That flu, in a more nightmarish fashion, killed mostly young healthy medically sound individuals. It spared the infants, the elderly, and many of the sick. It was the cytokine storm of the person's own inflammatory processes that led to the deaths in millions of cases. In other words, the immune system went into overdrive and overwhelmed the otherwise young and healthy bodies of those who were ill. The CoronaV has thus far followed the pattern of most other flu epidemics which kill the old, and medically compromised. Of course, this flu may mutate again, but at this point, it does not provide any evidence of doing so. So everyone should just chill, and, yes, wash their hands with soap and warm H2O."
2020-01-31 1:47,"This whole epidemic is really important. Yes, it may seem dramatized because of the Flu statistics, but this is spreading way faster than that infection, and is killing faster than the Flu ever has. Also, the Flu has a cure, and Chinese doctors are working round the clock, having to turn away patients with the amount of effected they're getting, with no cure or treatment plan in sight. Please don't disregard the vitality of the issue with claims of dramatization."
2020-01-31 1:26,We are depending on the openness of the Communist Dictatorship of China to make the world aware of the danger of the most recent coronovirus.  The fact that China is now admitting  that control of the virus is problematic probably means that the situation is much worse than is being reported.  This coupled with the incompetence of the Trump Administration should give us concern that the information currently provided to the public is probably less than complete.
2020-01-31 1:30,"I don’t think it’s 10,000 cases. There are probably 10,000 people in an average Chinese mall. Hate to sound totally paranoid, but I bet the numbers are much higher."
2020-01-31 2:10,"The death rate of the coronavirus is probably much lower than 2% as is computed from the current number of confirmed cases and the number of death, because there is likely to be a much larger base of people who have been infected, but have not been tested because their symptoms were not severe enough. This puts the new coronavirus closer to the flu than to other more deadly virus like SARS, MERS, Ebola. We should be prepared for the possibility that this new coronavirus cannot be contained and we have to learn to live with it. Attempts to eradicate it will be futile and extremely costly, just as any attempts to eradicate the flu will be."
2020-01-31 2:09,"I am hoping for no panic in the US. From what I read about the Spanish Flu, there was not panic then, and hundreds died in my city. Schools and theaters were shut for a while.

But they didn't have social media in 1919 to spread misinformation. 

Could get ugly."
2020-01-31 2:31,About time.
2020-01-31 2:30,"The title of this article is scary and alarming. .
 "" W.H.O declares Global Emergency as Wuhan Coronavirus Spreads""
  ""The announcement came as nearly 10,000 cases have been reported worldwide, almost all of them in mainland China"".
   10,000 is not a small number.
   Also, the WHO says ""  The declaration comes now because of fears that the coronavirus may reach countries with weak health care systems, where it could run amok, potentially infecting millions of people and killing thousands.""
   I started worrying about India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Afghanistan, the African countries, all those countries with huge population, weak health care systems and poor sanitary conditions This illness can really run amok in those countries. How are they going to handle that?"
2020-01-31 2:34,"Apart from being considered one of the great acrobats of the time, Bruce Lee was also a very early campaigner for gay rights (a fact which seems to escape the public consciousness).
In an incredible coincidence, Mr Lee described himself as being  ""fully confident and capable of winning the battle against this epidemic"" of homophobia.
One wonders whether Bruce Lee's heroic stand against prejudice might be applied in the effort to contain this coronavirus epidemic.
As the great Buce Lee said, ""Let the love of good men fill your void""."
2020-01-31 3:15,"I sat down tonight and did some research and found the following:

-video footage of an overworked Chinese hospital medic in a hazmat suit having a meltdown because he's terrified of this
-video footage of Chinese medical workers carrying corpses off the streets of sick people who have literally dropped dead in public
-video footage of Chinese soldiers with machine guns and hazmat suits enforcing quarantine policy. Looks like a scene out of half-life. If the virus isn't a big deal why the hazmat suits?
-statistically the disease is spreading rapidly. Much faster than SARS. On Jan 20th there were 278 confirmed cases... now there nearly that many deaths.

This is not your average virus, and for whatever reason the US news is not giving this the attention it deserves. I guess impeachment brings in more traffic."
2020-01-31 3:21,"As an objective and responsible mainstream media, NYT, please make the name of the coronavirus right - it’s called novel coronavirus, not “Wuhan coronavirus”, not “China coronavirus”. We already have enough hate in this world."
2020-01-31 3:32,Wasn't yesterday that it was reported approximately 800 cases & only 16 deaths? Now they're saying 200 deaths. I can understand why people are freaking out.
2020-01-31 3:39,"Great article; however, it states that “No deaths have yet occurred outside China.” It would be much more accurate to say that “no deaths have yet been REPORTED to have occurred outside of China.”"
2020-01-31 3:40,I have not been to the specific animal markets that this article mentions but I have seen others.  It is the most horrible place I have ever been to. In every instance there are animals of all species with absolute terror and frenzy in their eyes and I simply will never go back to these places of death. Is it possible this  virus is mother nature’s payback for inflicting so much misery on animals who simply want to coexist in the same world that we live in? As much as we congratulate ourselves as being masters of the universe there needs to be a larger voice for these animals and their rights to live too.
2020-01-30 23:27,"Dear All, 
What you need to focus on isn’t death rates because the virus didn’t run it’s course, what is important is survival rate 2 percent so far"
2020-01-31 4:19,"It's high time we inform all the medical institutes for finding a medicine. though health experts from WHO said that, it would take a month or two to manufacture and test the medicine, a good medical student would suggest a immediate solution with their fresh thoughts. Just like Vikram lander found by an Indian engineering student which was sent on to the Moon and lost its communication with us."
2020-01-31 4:18,"Apparently, any criticism of the Chinese Markets is considered hate speech, hate writing....whatever."
2020-01-31 4:22,"So far the response from all governments and other organizations has been remarkably consistent. It has always been too little, too late. And it shows no sign of changing. 

The only country that seems to be taking this outbreak seriously is North Korea. They had the sense to close their borders at the first sign of trouble. 

Whereas the WHO wants to encourage the Chinese to go on more international trips for the vitally important reasons of tourism and promoting cultural understanding, in the middle of an epidemic. 'No travel restrictions, no flight cancellations' they bleat, while the death toll keeps mounting."
2020-01-31 4:27,"China finished building a level 4 biohazard lab - The Wuhan Virology institute - in 2017.  Concerns were expressed about this facility's location and security at the time.

Research on corona viruses is being conducted at this facility. 
As of November they were seeking to hire one or two post-doc fellows, who will use ""bats to research the molecular mechanism that allows Ebola and SARS-associated coronaviruses to lie dormant for a long time without causing diseases.""

More information on this facility and the work being done there seems warranted."
2020-01-31 5:22,"The Chinese Communist Party knew about it yet chose to keep quiet <a href=""https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2001316"" target=""_blank"">https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2001316</a>. Plus, abolish the WHO. It has long become the CCP’s creature."
2020-01-31 5:48,"Don't know how fast the virus is spreading or how well the health authorities are reacting to the situation across the globe. What is obvious is misinformation, panic and unreasonable and hateful comments are spreading thick and fast. WHO has reacted appropriately - they had stated the situation needs review when they initially declined to declare a global emergency and now they have done so after the virus had been found in more countries. WHO is not there to speculate. They act based on measurable facts. If the WHO's response was late and inadequate, it is because facts about the infection has not been placed before if by the authorities.  It doesn't help to be cynical about anything and everything especially at this hour of crisis."
2020-01-31 6:56,"With now 10,000 cases and 200 deaths, we can safely assume the case fatality rate of the new coronavirus is much lower than 2% given the probable large number of undiagnosed cases. Compared to SARS (11%), Ebola (50%), H5N1 bird flu (60%), this virus hardly seem worth the constant media and medical attention. 

Statistically speaking, people are so much more likely to die from the common flu (12K-61K deaths annually in the US, more than half a million deaths globally every year, CDC data) than this virus. Every year, fewer than half of all Americans get the flu shot.

But alas, few will pay attention to these clear statistics that point to the little danger posed by this virus in our daily lives. Many more will believe the conspiracy theories and the ""experts"" they find on Youtube telling them to drink bleach. Panic rules the day, fanned by the constant unneeded media attention, including from the NYT. I'm sure there's gonna be a run on masks at my local Walgreens soon enough but no shortage of flu vaccines that people actually need..."
2020-01-31 9:07,"The world has met many such challenges and I am sure, this challenge too would be met effectively. What is required is sharing of even minute details, both ways, viz., weakness and strength of the virus. Instead of seeing this as an opportunity to make some quick money, pharmaceutical companies too should come out with cheap and affordable medicine to tackle this virus. May the Almighty show us the way."
2020-01-31 9:18,"It is being reported that this disease originated in a 

""wildlife"" market.  What is a wildlife market ?"
2020-01-31 9:19,"Like China, the W.H.O. has done far too litter, far too late.  Even now, they are hedging their bets at a time when lightening speed actions, following Hong Kong's example of halting border crossings from China until the coronavirus is better understood. 

Iceland is an example of a country at great risk but is still grossly slow in responding.  In spite of its enviable position of being a remote island with its own energy supplied, the number that visit  Iceland has surged from 4,000 to over 130000 in just 6 years.  Because of its economic dependency on Chinese tourism, Iceland has so far been unwilling to put any pause on entry.  

Meanwhile, the country has only one hospital that is already overtaxed and would, I believe, collapse under a coronavirus outbreak.  And following the W.H.O. politically correct lead is not helping any!"
2020-01-31 12:20,"The reaction to this epidemic has been too little, too late, beginning in China and spreading to the rest of the world as it allowed plane flights to continue.

We have to avoid the unreasoning panic of the kind we saw with Ebola, but we have to avoid a pandemic as well.

A quarantine period should have been required for flights from China, which would have protected those who needed to travel while discouraging unnecessary movement. Now there is a real danger of a pandemic."
2020-01-31 6:29,"When the news of the outbreak could no longer be contained, China moved quickly to show the world their aggressive measures.  But the entire problem lies with China's lack of news transparency, party mentality including but not limited to aggressive coverups.

Had the world jeard about the ""rumors"" in late December (started by certain informed doctors and low ranking officials) that China tried very hard to conceal, an entire population could be on high alert on things like personal hygiene, putting a stop on the eating of wild animals, implementing early hence effectual medical isolation etc., we'd all be in a vastly different situation."
2020-01-31 10:19,"This is the Year of the Rat in Chinese Lunar calendar.  Coronavirus is a bad start of the year for China.  However, this crisis will be over regardless.  Things will get better.  Being a good friend of Xi Jinping, the successful reelection of Donald Trump will be a friendly ending of the year for China."
2020-01-30 21:29,"This is starting to look like the 1918-1919 flu pandemic that killed 50 million to 100 million people worldwide, including several of my father's older siblings and other relatives.  And that was before widespread international air travel."
2020-01-30 23:36,"Just look at all the people in these comment threads doing backflips and twisting arguments like pretzels to downplay the risk from this disease.....all to prevent adoption of strong efforts against the diseaser from getting here.

My favorite of their ridiculous arguments is when they say we shouldn't fear or fight this virus because the regular flu kills more.  By that absurd illogic we shouldn't do anything to prevent regular flu either since more people die in car accidents."
2020-01-30 20:14,"Finally, W.H.O has done the thing that should have been done in the first place; calling Coronavirus an Emergency of International concern and a public hazard."
2020-01-30 21:39,"Better late than never, they should have done that over the weekend. Stop all flights, it's ridiculous to spread it and then worry about how to 'control'."

“As of 12:00 on January 31, 245 suspected cases have been ruled out in Shanghai, and 135 confirmed cases have been found. Among the confirmed cases, there were 70 males and 65 females; the oldest was 88 years old and the youngest was 7 years old; 89 had a history of living or traveling in Hubei, 2 had a history of living or traveling in provinces and cities outside Hubei, and 42 had a history of contact with related confirmed cases 2 cases had no contact history in Hubei; 62 cases came to Shanghai from overseas, and 73 cases lived in Shanghai. The specific situation is as follows: Currently, 120 cases are in stable condition, 5 cases are in critical condition, 9 cases are cured and discharged, and 1 case has died. There are still 200 suspected cases under investigation. : New Coronavirus 2019-nCoV
Source of infection: Wild animal, possibly Chinese chrysanthemum
Transmission routes: transmitted through respiratory droplets, or through contact
Vulnerable population: The population is generally susceptible. The elderly and those with underlying diseases are more ill after infection, and children, infants and young children also have symptoms
Incubation period: Generally 3 to 7 days, up to 14 days, contagious during incubation period.”"

If we ignore these people, if Twitter can shut them down, if Facebook can police the nonsense memes, then we might do well in managing the real infection."
2020-01-31 16:42,"With approximately 200 deaths in about 10,000 cases of the coronavirus, the lethality rate is about 2%. But, it is a very small RNA virus with a high mutation rate. Is the probability that the virus evolves and mutates into a more lethal virus, very likely? With the development of a vaccine estimated to be at least one year away, does this current pool of coronaviruses act as a pool to feed inputs into an environment which possibly generates additional mutations? Is the time delay a critical, risky variable?

As with the slow development of the Ebola vaccine, the underfunded development of new antibiotics to treat more resistant bacterial strains, and now the delay in developing a vaccine for this current virus, makes you wonder if current medical funding is disoriented, as indicated by these examples of neglected vaccine and bacterial work? Big Pharma often develops very expensive and individualized immune-system based drugs, or mental health drugs to be taken over a lifetime. These are drugs with big monetary payoffs. 

But, for vaccines and other ""one and done"" drug dosages, the profit incentive to invest in such drugs is small. Profit- wise, in cost/benefit comparisons, patients' infrequent usage of such drugs means there is no money to be made in the long-run to recoup the initial, costly investment.

2020-01-31 18:01,"One of the reasons American manufacturers bring their money to China is because there are few if any regulations. No need to pay workers living wages, no need for watchdogs guarding the safety of food and medicine and the environment . Watching whether citizens say anything against the regime rather than watching out for their safety and health is what China does. Supporting China and its treatment of its people just to get the lowest price possible is immoral. Their lack of regulations doesn’t just effect them these days. We are all vulnerable."

 so I want to tell the Chinese people you are welcome in Pakistan anytime this is your second home we are decent Nation.

 I want and expect all Pakistani people to welcome any Foreigner especially Chinese who are good neighbors, if they are sick we will take care of you and treat you as best as we can we are Muslim and we are not racist towards anyone."
2020-01-30 16:22,I’m no fan of the Chinese authoritarian regime but the country has gone to great lengths to get this virus under control and is cooperating with world health organizations in its effort. A display of knee jerk xenophobia against Chinese people in general is disgusting. What’s needed is to identify and isolate and treat carriers as quickly and efficiently as possible.

2020-01-30 17:07,"In an article elsewhere today it was noted that two Japanese being repatriated from Wuhan to Japan refused to be tested for the new coronavirus and were admitted without being quarantined.

Apparently such refusal is permitted under Japanese law, though I would have thought such a law could be suspended for the duration of the coronavirus epidemic (or at least quarantine allowed).

I certainly do not want to see the Japanese experience an epidemic, but if they aren’t careful they may be creating grounds for anti-Japanese sentiment along the lines of the anti-Chinese feelings discussed in this article."
2020-01-30 17:15,"Ignorance, use of sentiment downplays the racism that is underlining these behaviors. Any Flu outbreak is as dangerous as this particular one, once the vaccine is found to be effective all the noise will go away, it is also the duty of journalist to keep people informed of what is rather than trumpet just the side effect of any outbreak especially if the source is not from our zones"
2020-01-30 17:04,"There is genuine primeval fear of death from virus which has no known cure .Chinese government steps of quarantine large population of 40 million also contributes to the fear.

2020-01-30 17:30,"It’s always the very worst that exemplifies the absolute best in us.  
The government of a China could actually try and learn from this second major outbreak and institute public Health on a national level that works.  A public health department as strong and influential as their Ministry of Public Security. Unfortunately they will need to curb the vast corruption that plagues local governments."
2020-01-30 17:27,"It’s pretty impressive to see an article about casual racism towards Chinese and many of the comments casually telling the Chinese what to eat and that they’re apparently backwards for having different culinary tastes developed over thousands of years. Could improvements on hygiene be made in these markets? Absolutely. But just because they eat something different than you doesn’t mean they’re “threatening the world with viruses”. America is one of the top consumers of pork in the world, pigs are by far one of the most dangerous virus carriers that could spread something to humans, but no one labels us as a viral threat. Not because we don’t eat this meat or that meat, but because of hygiene standards at the point of sale. 

So maybe before you knock an entire culture because they don’t eat what you want them to, dig a little deeper to get to the root cause."
2020-01-30 17:45,"As an Asian-Anerican I have certainly wondered whether people are now looking at me differently because of the viral outbreak, though Trump and his base had already been flaming anti-nonwhite sentiment.  It does not help when Chinese nationals have just been arrested trying to steal American technologies (so much for that recently signed ‘trade deal’ with China!)

Fortunately I live in a very liberal state, but I find myself now trying to make sure that I am seen as American who has nothing to do with China. (In fact, I had been afraid to go there because of the total surveillance before this crisis - surveillance that is, ironically, not so total)"
2020-01-30 17:21,"Am I the only one bothered by claims by other readers that the diet and culture of the Chinese population is ‘disgusting’? This is an entirely subjective evaluation. What makes the food consumed in Western societies superior? There are numerous example of cuisine and foods that may be viewed by non-Westerns as questionable. I think the easy attempt to vilify another society overlooks other realities that are somewhat out of our control: zoonoses has existed for millennia. With the increase in human populations, it is more likely for diseases to jump from species to species."
2020-01-30 17:29,My sympathies with the Chinese people. Nobody understands hatred and xenophobia more then the Muslim people when the entire community gets stigmatized for the sin of a few.

What they don’t report is the approximate number of infections population wide. These are probably younger, healthier people who don’t want to fool with going to the doctor unless their condition turns grave. We actually have no idea how widespread this virus is or the percentage of people who are just having a bad flu and recovering."

2020-01-30 18:11,"Fear of the unknown is a very human emotion. Right now, we know very little about this new disease, so it is scary. Hundreds of thousands still die every year from diseases like malaria, tuberculosis, dengue and others. But they are old enemies and we know them well.

How easily can this virus spread? We don't know. Can apparently healthy people infect others? We don't know, but initial reports suggest that it is possible. How widely has it already spread? We don't know. The reported numbers of infected and dead are only a fraction of the true numbers, because no country is routinely testing everyone with a fever and cough. How lethal is it? We don't know yet, but will find out soon. Initial estimates suggest a mortality rate of 2 to 3 %. How many people are going to get this virus? We don't know. How many are going to die from it? We don't know. Could be hundreds, could be millions. 

When faced with the unknown, it is better to assume the worst and take every possible precaution, until you get enough hard data to take more informed decisions. International tourism is not a basic human right. Money is of no use to you if you and your family are dead. Viruses don't care how politically correct or non discriminatory you are."

What the article does not mention is that a majority of those parents are Chinese! It seems then higher ups are trying to make this about race, but is about safety. They are asking any child who has just visited China, not only the Chinese ones to avoid school as to not spread this virus. Common sense people."
2020-01-30 18:05,"The reaction is to some extent similar to when AIDS began making headlines and killing hundreds.  At the start, many people in Manhattan were terrified: we didn’t know exactly how it was transmitted.  The attitude transformed into massive one-on-one help and support when thousands became infected and the CDC reported it could not be transmitted through the air.  The US banned also HIV  people from entering the country.  That this coronavirus and others like it might be airborne. Well, that’s a whole new ballgame."
2020-01-30 18:15,"Maybe there would be less fear-driven bigotry if there were more education about the roots of epidemics. In the case of the Coronavirus, it’s about animal-to-human transmission of a virus human bodies can’t handle. The same was true of SARS. Why the transmission? Cruel live animal markets. Why does this continue in China and elsewhere? Also, how is Climate Change and despoliation of the natural world opening the door to new viruses? Yes, this has all be reported. But keep reporting it.

2020-01-30 18:56,"I think it’s naive to condemn Chinese xenophobia without explaining the why people are skeptical of China. During the SARS epidemic, the Chinese government was slow to respond and initially tried to cover it up. Even at the start of the current epidemic, the Chinese government punished 8 people for discussing the virus on social media. The government seems to be generally responding better this time, but China lies constantly. 

A lot of the blame for the xenophobia against Chinese tourists lies with the Chinese government. Adopt Western levels of openness and accountability. Then maybe other countries won’t be constantly questioning if they can trust China."

2020-01-30 18:32,"Unlike anti-Chinese sentiment in the West, which is perhaps mainly driven by racial and fear of a dominant China economically and militarily, the anti-Chinese sentiment in many SE Asian countries mostly is a result of recently Chinese tourists flooding into these countries.  As I have traveled extensively in the region, most of complaints from local people is about the attitudes and behaviors of Chinese tourists.  It reinforces the unfavorable stereotyping of Chinese.  Western tourists and locals tend to avoid establishments catering to Chinese tourists.  The Coronavirus should be a lesson and wake up call to Chinese traveling aboard."

2020-01-30 18:29,"In the US, they'd claim racism, but now it's just xenophobia because other Asians are equally unhappy to have Chinese people around.  Is it really xenophobia, or fear of catching a deadly, fast spreading disease with China as the epicenter?"
2020-01-30 19:07,"I don’t think it’s fair to direct ire at Chinese people, but to the Chinese Communist Party? I’m all for it. 

It’s no surprise that a regime that maniacally pushes censorship and propaganda is charge of the country that saw this outbreak. On this morning’s episode of The Daily, the Beijing reporter talked about how at the hospital in Wuhan, doctors refused to test a woman who died of what may have been coronavirus. 

Only a culture for censorship and against transparency, even when it puts human lives at risk, could have prompted such behavior from medical health professionals, who are generally trained to put health concerns first."

2020-01-30 19:17,"I was just at a car repair center this morning where an elderly white woman asked me if I were from Wuhan, China. More than a bit annoyed with the obvious racial profiling, I told her that indeed I just arrived in Los Angeles from Wuhan and came directly to the repair center. More than a few people were staring at us with a combination of anxiety and amusement. The woman laughed, apologized, and said that she herself is a second-generation Armenian who grew up on stories of anti-Armenian discrimination.  I said something to the effect that gallows humor might be one of the things we need to get through this crisis. Some people in the room chuckled, others seem not so amused. On reflection, I wondered how things would have been if I couldn't speak English, and had I really recently arrived from central China, or if the elderly woman screamed in horror and ran out of the shop. In this time of anxiety, we would be advised to learn the lessons from ""The Monsters Are Due on Maple Street"" episode of the Twilight Zone: ...the tools of conquests are not bombs and explosions, they are attitudes and prejudices in minds of people."

2020-01-30 18:34,"Nicholas Kristof posted an opinion piece today that is essentially xenophobic toward China.. just focused on China leadership (dictatorship was his term) in a political diatribe that is classic Anti-China. 

The NYTs regularly posts anti-China articles and opinions.. and regardless of their intention and narrative.. what they do is draw out a lot of very clear xenophobia by NYT comment posters. 

My point?  NYT is the glass house here and has no business casting stones about xenophobia. 

China... by virtue of hard earned experience with prior coronavirus outbreaks.. has handled this current crisis very well... as have it's people.  This is not my personal perspective, but the perspective of virtually ALL world health organizations. 

But you know what.... xenophobia in human beings is never far... and only needs virtually any alleged trigger to pull it up to the surface.  Then again... Americans are like this in so many ways internally American against American too... so it goes to the selfish, hateful, and tribal characteristics of human nature."

I don’t know the extent to which xenophobia is involved, but people are overreacting. This new disease will almost certainly kill fewer people than the normal seasonal flu or the 2009 swine flu that originated in Mexico and killed 12,000 Americans yet did not lead to a travel ban on Mexicans."

2020-01-30 19:33,"I think people turn to racism and stereotyping at times like these because they think it gives them some control over the actual threat.  People label the coronavirus as a Chinese thing, thus if they avoid Chinese people entirely, they will be safe from the virus.  Of course, this isn't true in both directions, plenty of Chinese people have no possibility of transmitting this virus, and plenty of non-Chinese people have contracted it and can spread it.

It's unfortunate, but this is something humans seem hard-wired to do, find differences with other humans and then discriminate against groups they consider to be different.

The most ridiculous thing in this case is that the coronavirus is nowhere near as deadly or as widespread as the common flu.  The flu is worldwide, can be spread by anyone, and kills over 600,000 people every year.  But since we're so used to it, it doesn't seem to have sunk in with anybody that this coronavirus is no threat at all compared to a virus we've always dealt with."
2020-01-30 19:46,"We're all going to hear much more about the mysterious coronavirus over the coming days and weeks. Let's hope the authorities and medical professionals the world over work together to contain and eliminate it as soon as possible.

Moving forward, can we agree, as members of the homo sapiens family, not to eat bats and snakes, and the like -- no, I'm not being xenophobic -- unless stuck in the wild and facing a life-or-death situation?"
2020-01-30 17:35,"The Chinese certainly don’t deserve abuse for this virus, but it might make sense to steer clear given the nature of the virus.

Still, there is a parallel in what the Chinese have done to countries such as Cambodia, where they chewed up a charming beach town to build Chinese-only casinos, employing Chinese workers, and sending that revenue to Beijing rather than building the economy of the country they are colonizing. A common phrase there: The Chinese are coming! does not mean anything good. One can probably imagine the Cambodians gloating over the irony."

Darkness at noon in America."
2020-01-30 21:02,The terror and fear the Chinese people must be feeling for themselves and their families. Their government let them down in their initial response and now they are paying the price. It’s alright to be wise and cautious but cruel and racist NO.  My heart goes out to the Chinese people .... you will get through this ... we will get through this.
2020-01-30 21:19,"This is ridiculous!

If you want to find cases of sickle cell anemia, you don't indiscriminately test people at random....instead you test black people.  That absolutely does not make you a racist because it is pure logic and mathematical probability that accounts for your behavior.

Similarly, this disease originated in China and still primarily affects only Chinese persons (over 99%).  I think even most of the victims of the cases that occurred outside of China were Chinese persons who traveled to other countries.  This near exclusivity to Chinese persons will persist until non-Chinese persons start exhibiting the disease in substantial numbers.  

If you were in China, then it would be illogical to try to avoid Chinese people because over 99% of the population you encounter would be Chinese.  But if you are in a place where only a few percent or less of the population is Chinese, then you could avoid all Chinese people with little inconvenience to yourself.  

Our government has stubbornly refused to ban non-US citizens from entering the US if they have recently been in China.  And, such visitors don't wear signs indicating they came from China.  Therefore, it is convenient and logical to avoid a small percentage of our population which has a higher chance of containing some members who are recently arrived from China.  That is not xenophobia or racism.  It is logic and mathematical probability used for the sole purpose of avoiding a very serious, sometimes fatal, disease."
2020-01-30 20:28,"SARS is a good historical parallel. However, SARS petered out and didn't seem to become endemic.  That would be an optimistic outcome today.

However, if this virus becomes endemic, a more apt parallel might be AIDS.  The initial link between AIDS and gay men made it convenient to call it a ""gay cancer"".  Rather than study and treat AIDS, it was easier to blame the victims and be done with.

Consequently, a disease that might have been contained with aggressive early effort now afflicts nearly 40 million people worldwide.

So even if one is not compelled by compassion for fellow human beings, out of sheer self preservation, one should lend a helping hand to contain this novel coronavirus."
2020-01-30 20:46,"I hope people will read this article and realize so many of their calls of 'racism' in many (not all) settings are absurd.  These are Koreans/Japanese (Asians, last time I looked) who are calling for bans or restrictions of Chinese people (also Asians).

Many of the animals reported for sale in the Wuhan market are critically endangered—eg., the Chinese giant salamander. The Chinese are eating endangered animals into extinction, especially for traditional medicines. And zoonotic diseases are much more likely to spring from exotic vs domestic animal consumption.

Obviously this isn’t about Chinese Americans who haven’t recently traveled to China nor Chinese citizens of Canada, Australia etc. It is about tourists, students, business trippers etc of any race or nationality who may have been exposed to the virus in China or in their travels . 

People are frightened and it’s much easier for them to just brand all Chinese as potential disease threats rather than take the time to figure out if they even are. Here in the US I would expect that many can’t tell Chinese apart from Japanese or Koreans so anti-Asian distancing might well pop up if the disease threat here worsens.

This isn’t at all unprecedented though. Just recently the outbreak of measles within the Hasidic community of NY resulted in reports of lots of people rejecting the presence of Hasidic Jews on buses, in stores and other venues. Essentially all those who appeared to be religious Jews were presumed to potentially be a measles carrier.

Unfortunately, that doesn't stop bias on the part of people who are afraid.  I remember nearly 40 years ago when AIDS was more and more prominent in the US.  The mere fact that initially, the disease 'appeared' to be affecting gay men got people all bent out of shape because so many were terrified of dying, and because most people's experience with disease is the airborne variety, they led themselves to believe that even being in the same room as a gay person would potentially expose them to the disease.  All these fearful responses actually detrimented good scientific response to the disease and set back research by years.  If not for that initial panic reaction, AIDS/HIV might already be cured now.

For those of you who deem articles like this as anti-China, xenophobic, or racist, go to Twitter and Reddit to check out videos of how people from Wuhan and Hubei are being received in other parts of China now.

There have been occasions where people rounded up cars with Hubei plates and forced the drivers out of the city they were trying to enter. Also, Wuhanese are being illegally rejected by hotels and public facilities elsewhere in China. A video I watched today shows that a bunch of people violently sealed the door of an apartment which housed a few residents from Wuhan without their permission.

In fact, the majority of Chinese people, especially the young ones, are rather dissatisfied with the way the government handled this crisis. Many of us feel that the CCP and the Chinese state media it has direct control over should have disclosed the severity of the corona virus and mobilized all those necessary measures to counter the spread of it much earlier than when this matter has escalated to a more precarious level."

The timing of the emergence of the virus is unfortunate coinciding with the holidays and Chinese New Year when millions of people who normally wouldn’t be travelling have.

It would seem to me that most of us have mentally placed a big quarantine sign on the doors of mainland China. 

It's not Xenophobia, it's WuhanCoronavirusPhobia."
2020-01-30 23:03,"One fundamental thing is missing in this ad hoc collection of episodes of varying degrees of seriousness.  That is a simple and familiar fact that CCP's control of flow of informaction has been and still is a major factor behind this epidemic.  Jumping to xenophobia issues is easy, but the ubiquitous manipulation by CCP of the populace makes some people on many different locations almost feel the Chinese are another species."
2020-01-30 23:41,"17 years ago, the kids in my neighborhood coordinated to wear masks one day. They then shooed the one Asian, me, back home. ""You're going to give us SARS."" At that time, I had not been out of the country for several years—not that it mattered to them. I remember it like yesterday.

I can only hope I do not have to experience that again."
2020-01-30 23:02,"I'm a Chinese-American who has planned to fly to Japan on Valentine's Day. I'm seriously thinking about canceling our trip. The thought of a ten hour flight scares me. Should we wear our face masks? 

I don't know how we will be treated in Tokyo, and the virus is spreading there. At the same time, we won't get a refund on our flight tickets since we booked with Expedia months in advance... 

I am more fearful of angry people than the virus, frankly. More people die from the flu virus and choose not to get vaccinated. More people die from gun violence, and our gun regulation laws are terrible. More people die from smoking, and big tobacco is now pushing vaping. Climate change, pollution, cancer, heart disease-- all of this will claim more lives than coronavirus and yet fear and panic have infected the world. What a scary place to live in these days."
2020-01-30 23:40,"According to the WHO this is now a global health crisis with no known cure. I would have thought keeping the movement of people, particularly those at or close to the source of the outbreak, to a minimum would actually make very practical sense. 

But i also realize that running for the handbook on political correctness in order to wave the racism/xenophobia card makes for compelling reading these days too!"

2020-01-30 23:05,"Some groups in America are perpetually discriminated against, despised, and ostracized (African Americans come to mind.) Even when they’re virus-free. We’re a world that thrives on hate. No virus seems capable of wiping that out."
2020-01-30 23:23,"Regarding the xenophobic Kwong Wing Catering in Hong Kong. Unlike your discrimination against your fellow Chinese from the Mainland, the Wuhan coronavirus does not discriminate. Hong Kongers, Mainland Chinese, Taiwanese, Cantonese-speakers, English-speakers, the virus does not care. It gets them all."
2020-01-30 23:44,"Edited from earlier posting:

This isn't xenophobia .. It's about fear of getting sick. I see it as no different than when I was a little boy with measles in the 1940s watching a yellow quarantine sign being placed on our front door. Do most countries still require ships to anchor out in the bay and fly yellow quarantine flags when they have people aboard who have contagious diseases? I suspect the answer is yes.

2020-01-30 23:45,Chinese netizens should compile a database of businesses by countries who are xenophobic to Chinese. Sooner or later this coronavirus will blow over. Let potential Chinese tourists and customers remember which country and which business simply hate them. Help save the racists the embarrassment of making money off Chinese customers. Don't patronize them. Take their business elsewhere.
2020-01-30 23:53,Good grief. Firearms kill far more people in America alone than the virus has been killing in China. Ban guns instead.
2020-01-30 23:54,"I certainly can't tell the Chinese what they should eat,  but the bill for these delicacies are now in the  millions, actually billions if you account for the lose of productivity, and has cost almost 200 lives so far. The Chinese government needs to do a cost benefit analysis and see if eating these wild animals is worth the cost."
2020-01-30 23:56,"The original analysis of the origin of this virus was a live animal market.  SARS I believe was of poultry or avian origin.
The Chinese embrace killing and consumption of undomesticated wild animals, as well as the domestic dog and cat.  
China consistently is the source of life-threatening viruses over the years.
Maybe the Chinese need to change their eating habits so the world can be safe?"
2020-01-30 23:58,"if the chinese people do not want to be tarred with the same brush the rest of the world paints the PRC government with then they need to do something about the mendacity, maliciousness, and rapaciousness of their government.  at some point the people of a country have to be held accountable to the government that they tolerate."
2020-01-31 0:00,China with their latest animal/human borne virus threat to billions of innocent people around the World is not making any friends but is making lots of enemies. What the heck are they doing? They must get up to sanitary norms for the 21st Century if they want to be taken seriously as a world power. If they keep up with what they are doing they will be spurned after this especially if it gets out of hand and tens of millions die making the 1918 Flu Pandemic of 50 million look like a bad day.
2020-01-31 0:17,"Almost every tv station has covered the story of the Chinese lady who was sick, got on a plane, and then evaded being checked so she could eat at 3 star restaurants in France. All the Chinese government did after she bragged about it on Weibo is talk to her. That was not enough, and will do nothing to alm people down."
2020-01-31 0:21,I wonder if those same xenophobics - if they became infected with the  coronavirus - also refunded to be treated by a Chinese Doctor who didn't have the disease.
2020-01-31 0:29,"A few observations I would like to share after following this story on NYTimes, DailyMail, YouTube, Facebook, Reddit, and an assortment of Asian news outlet.

I notice the rumor mill online seems to be driven by a few country/area that shared a few common traits: some English proficiency, existing anti-China sentiment, and raising nativism/nationalism. Most of the outrageous rumors seems to be from the US, Hong Kong, Taiwan, the Philippines, and India.

These countries/areas also have low trust in their government which I believe is why their population not only refused to trust official Chinese figures but also WHO and western media. Less than 2 days ago I was witnessing a fight among conspiracists on YouTube comments section on the actual death toll in Wuhan with the most outrageous claimed that 1 million infected and 150,000 dead. He based this on the empty streets from a video taken at 2 AM.

Then there are the viral videos that somehow become much more creditable in a crisis. A lone medical worker complaining of exhaustion, a no-context clip of hospital corridor, some guy fainting, and a woman eating bat soup all became “what’s really happening”. In normal circumstances the credibility of these videos would be called into question but in time of crisis, a lot more people blindly believes in doomsday prophets."
2020-01-31 0:34,"Instead of judging the entire nation for eating “disgusting food” and being judgmental about ethnic cuisine, one must keep in mind that this virus didn’t come from national cuisine but from unregulated, black market food. If US had outbreak from non-FDA regulated food like illegal alligator farm, you wouldn’t blame the entire eating habit of all Americans and the FDA."
2020-01-31 0:39,"Western food superior is funny joke. Diabetes, stroke, cholesterol, heart attacks kill more. And we spread western food around world. 

Our junk, fast, instant, fried, garbage is more civilized than Chinese food? Laughable. Hygiene is inferior but the history and culture of Chinese cuisine is vastly superior"
2020-01-31 0:44,"In 1918 the Spanish flu, which also started in China wiped out one third of the world's population. Sufferers had a horrible demise. The epidemic was covered up by the USA  - not unlike  what China is doing now - however since Spain was not involved in WW1 they freely reported it. People are terrified of a repeat which is more likely now with global travel. It's hard to contain a virus such as this but containing it is essential to prevent it spreading."
2020-01-31 1:08,China in many ways is a threat  to the whole world
2020-01-31 1:04,"The coronavirus hysteria is overshadowing a yearly epidemic that is much closer to home...the flu virus! Thousands affected yearly around the world with many deaths, please see CDC website for exact details. Let's get our priorities straight."
2020-01-31 0:53,"Viruses are dumb - they can't tell what ethnicity you identify with. But humans are stupid - they think they can tell your ethnicity and rush to all kinds of judgments based on that. 

If even 10x as many people in China are afflicted with the virus than their government claims,  it's still such a tiny fraction of the people as to be a statistical blip.

The flu is more dangerous than this virus, and yet flu vaccines still aren't mandatory. There must be something about human nature that causes us to overestimate some risks and underestimate others. It seems like perhaps news organizations and NGOs haven't done a good job at elucidating the actual risk factors and helping people better inform themselves."
2020-01-31 1:09,"Welcome to the Brave New World of the Internet!

This will be the breeding grounds for international conflict in the future.  It is already disrupting successful economic and political structures (just look at Brexit).  

Facebook, Twitter, etc will be the modern tools of 'Divide and Conquer', the proven strategy of Caesar and the Roman Empire.

Every narcissistic moron who can use those tools to his advantage has an opportunity to take over the world.  

It is only a question of time until one of them manages to pull the wool over the head of the voters and become President of the United States...."
2020-01-31 1:15,The infection of Donald Trump’s régime is a far greater threat to the world than this virus. Why do we not see “Americans stay away” signs in stores and restaurants around the globe?
2020-01-31 1:10,"Very unfortunate reaction. This crisis should be dealt with diligently, but also with compassion towards Chinese populations, home and away. In the mean time, Americans should not be giving anyone, anywhere food/diet advice for all the obvious reasons, but especially the de-regulation of food standards (see: pork) under the Trump administration."
2020-01-31 1:21,"Too many people have been exposed by now.  I doubt that the virus can still be contained by quarantine measures alone.  It seems to be moderately contagious, perhaps a little less than the flu judging from the spread so far.

Of course, there will be the possibility of vaccination, probably in the not too distant future, but we do have to consider the sensibilities of the anti-vaxxers, won't we!?"
2020-01-31 1:34,"Social media and news reports of the coronavirus, particularly dead bodies, masked village residents, and mayhem, certainly incites fear and panic in the general public everywhere. And fear is always lies behind discriminatory behaviors towards others."
2020-01-31 1:36,"The global economy has been slowing for a while, partly because of Trump's tariffs and go-it-alone trade policies. The lackluster U.S. GDP numbers just released reflect that. The coronavirus, along with a quarantined China, will slow it even more."
2020-01-31 1:36,"The Chinese just have a different set of standards than we do in the U.S. as to what is edible and what isn’t, but that doesn’t make them bad! 

Hope this crisis gets better and the sanitary conditions at wet markets improve. The regime needs to enforce their sanitary codes as well."
2020-01-31 1:50,To date about 8200 Americans have died of the flu and people droll on about this. Get a life
2020-01-31 2:00,"The Chinese are the first to proclaim how special they and their culture are. It's not xenophobia to hear and believe them. Anyone who has visited China can tell you it is one of the most racist and xenophobic places on the planet. So the worldwide reaction is, in a way, very ""Chinese."""
2020-01-31 2:01,"@Paul while I agree with you, your comment had nothing to do with Allen’s comment and clearly was made out of some kind of prejudice towards Americans."
2020-01-31 1:48,"Never an article about the pervasive xenophobia that exists in China towards “westerners.” But westerners are fair game. Notice how 19 reasonable and concerned people in Toronto substitutes for “xenophobia” in all the West compared to millions in Japan, Vietnam, Thailand and other Asian countries. I find this article to be prejudiced and offensive."
2020-01-31 1:38,It’s the Chinese today. It will be another nation tomorrow.
2020-01-31 1:53,"The Coronavirus as serious as it is has caused 200 deaths so far, yet influenza, flu and related respiratory diseases account for anywhere from 291,000 to 646,000 deaths worldwide each year.
Our media has created a panic environment that's far beyond the real risks of the epidemic.
Most Asian countries have China as their largest trading partner and their economic rise in the past decades was in great part due to China's impressive growth and Chinese tourists are an important source of revenue for these countries.
It would be ill-advised to treat Chinese citizens unfairly, There will be retribution for Chinese consumers can also boycott these countries. Let's not forget China is by far the world's  largest economy with a purchasing power parity GDP of $27.9 trillion.
In so far as eating habits let me point to exotic tastes such as Kentucky Burgoo which has as recipe that may include  squirrel, possum, assorted birds, racoon, venison and even muskrat not to mention French culinary delicacy snail (escargot).
So let's look in the mirror before bashing China and Chinese  citizens."
2020-01-31 2:06,What is far more frightening than this minor virus is that Republicans and the Trump Administration in the US are creating a government that looks more like the Totalitarian Chinese State than American democracy.
2020-01-31 2:06,"I do not care what the Chinese eat. I just want them to be present day regarding their sanitary standards. They are very careless in that regard. In many ways, they remain backward."
2020-01-31 2:10,I'm sure the Uighurs would agree.
2020-01-31 2:19,"suspending flights to from a location properly determined to be likely to have infected people in incubating stage who would be selfishly motivated to leave that area surreptitiously is unfortunate but a rational response basically the same as the enforced quarantine of wuhan and nearby cities by Chinese govt. 
Being afraid of coming in contact with an Asian person outside China is irrational and unjustifiable. any person who has been at risk of having contracted the virus would have sought medical care by now and you wont find him randomly riding the train trying to infect others"
2020-01-31 2:21,"Quick to judge, quick to anger, slow to understand.
Ignorance & prejudice & fear go hand in hand.

Fear is the path to the dark side. Fear leads to anger. Anger leads to hate. Hate leads to suffering."
2020-01-31 2:38,"Yes, let's all be politically correct and wipe out the entire planet!"
2020-01-31 2:49,"Virus or not, why do people hate Chinese?"
2020-01-31 2:49,"Cutting to the quick, some Chinese people eat all kinds of things, things some of us might consider unimaginable as food -- bats, dogs, etc. They do not become sick by consuming well-cooked animal flesh. Rather, as there is a market for such combustibles, the *handlers* of live animals become infected, and transmit their infection to other humans.
Compare India, a land of comparable population density, pressure. Why is India not more often the source of viral pandemics? Might it not be because most of them do not consume meat, let alone bats, dogs, monkeys?
Culinary tastes are no reason for racial discrimination. If people are educated about the risks involved in what they eat (NB McDonalds!), their behavior may change. 
Let's educate each other, to the best of our ability."
2020-01-31 2:38,"We certainly live in different times now. You are immediately labelled a racist or not culturally sensitive for making any observations regarding demographics, especially nationality from some Asian countries.
I agree that the term Coronavirus is preferred, and not China virus or Wuhan virus.
However, the terms Spanish flu, German measles (rubella), and Marburg virus have been used for many decades. Perhaps those terms are not appropriate either"
2020-01-31 2:55,"Let's note that 'Chinese' and 'Asian' are mostly synonymous for Westerners. Second, third generation and biracial people are going to be submitted to the same ostracism as Chinese people, even if they have never been to Asia. My daughter was called 'Chinese' at school, my husband gets asked if he speaks Chinese.  At first, I thought it'd for once be an advantage - cough a little and wait for the crowd to thin - but the preeminently hysterical comments I have read in the NYT - and it's the NYTIMES! - have convinced me that we'll need to be careful, I don't want my family to be the next scapegoats."
2020-01-31 3:14,"Not too long ago some in China were proudly & happily calling this new virus outbreak a ""patriotic virus'.. because they believed it was only affecting people in other countries.
  Now we (and they) know the truth.. The outbreak has always been centered in China, but the lies & hubris from within the country hid the the spread of the disease..and helped make it worse...
--- In light of this, perhaps its natural and good-sense for other countries to seek a little 'distance' from China."
2020-01-31 3:20,"There are many things to criticize about China and the practices of Chinese as they make their way around the world.  Think of the takeover of Tibet and the subjugation of the Tibetan people and the attempt to destroy their cultural and religious identity.  Think of the Uighurs and the millions that are currently in re-education camps.  Think of the military build up of the Spratleys.  Think of the crack down in Hong Kong.  Think of the all the intellectual theft.  Think of the surveillance state within anywhere where Chinese control.  To not want to be taken over by Chinese is not xenophobic.  On the contrary, to not want to be taken over by Chinese is a desire based in freedom and the rights of global minorities to exist.   Many, if not most, of the worlds epidemics have originated in China.  That the desire to not be taken over by Chinese in terms of population, economics or in any other way is a normal desire, devoid of any xenophobic content.  To not be infected by a virus emanating from China is not to be xenophobic at all.  That these two desires may be acute right now and reinforce each other, should not be taken as xenophobic.  On the contrary these desires should be considered normal and worthy of praise, that is, if you like freedom, liberty, democracy, cultural/religious diversity and physical health.  We should be taking the ethical high ground and attempting to help the world defend itself against the practices, and in this case the disease, coming from China."
2020-01-31 3:21,"Good grief, there are people dying. Had this started in the USA I doubt we could lock down, New York, La or Chicago to prevent the spread. This really ticks me off... there are human beings suffering. I am scared witless, my son and his family live in Beijing. My granddaughter just one year old, are over there. Luckily they have been away from Beijing due to the New Year, but he has to work at some point. I think China should be commended on the unprecedented actions to prevent the spread. Just pray, send healing vibes out, these things will help more than increasing tensions with protests and petty words."
2020-01-31 3:31,"I feel it is a natural reaction to be wary of a group, of whatever ethnicity, known to be the current major vector of a new infectious disease. It so happens to be the Chinese, a visible minority, which is even more alarming given the density of their population, but any group would have been singled out.
I do not think this is xenophobia, it would call it a manifestation of our survival instinct.
Because the Chinese are involved, we must nonetheless consider another contemporary underlying issue; the current industrial espionage done on a global scale by Chinese citizens, mostly students and engineers studying and working temporarily in host countries, which they are legally bound to do by the state. 
For those who are unaware of it, the Chinese government, in 2017, passed a law requiring any of its citizens, residing in any country, to collect information for the state, if requested to do so, or risk persecution: <a href=""https://www.canada.ca/en/security-intelligence-service/corporate/publications/china-and-the-age-of-strategic-rivalry/chinas-intelligence-law-and-the-countrys-future-intelligence-competitions.html"" target=""_blank"">https://www.canada.ca/en/security-intelligence-service/corporate/publications/china-and-the-age-of-strategic-rivalry/chinas-intelligence-law-and-the-countrys-future-intelligence-competitions.html</a>

Given the above, I fear the situation is much more complicated than just the current pandemic."
2020-01-31 3:32,"I don’t understand the hysteria over this Coronavirus, where is the hysteria over the flu. Which has killed more than 80,000 people to date. If you take care of yourself with a virus you have a complete recovery with the exception of those with other afflictions. Flu on the other hand is deadly and very much more contagious to people around you. Especially in Churches, doctors offices, transportation, schools, and other contained places. They tell you to wash your hands and cough into your elbow. But how often do you see this happening. Get your flu shots and wash your hands and cover you mouth. Makes sense to me even for this new virus. Good luck and good health."
2020-01-31 4:01,Stop the disgusting wildlife trade in China. That would be a good start.
2020-01-31 4:04,Vi rus didn’t distinguish borders. Human beings do.
2020-01-31 4:16,"Xenophobia makes a good story. It looks more cultural, more sophisticated than the basic animal-like instinct of preservation. 
A basic universal human reaction is to avoid risks of catching a life-threatening virus. Given the current situation, this means avoiding contact with China. How much of the “xenophobic reactions ” are based on our primal instinct of preservation? 
Why do journalists need to frame people’s most basic fear as xenophobic? Who wins by doing this? This makes a good headline but communications between people of different cultures who barely understand each other is already hard enough, why undermining it even more?????"
2020-01-31 4:30,"The Chinese government is to blame, quarantining tens of millions of people across large areas. They are obviously quite scared, why wouldn’t everyone else be the same way? Of course, nobody should be giving people who haven’t recently visited China a hard time."
2020-01-31 6:12,"The Chinese deserve nothing but contempt. They knew about the Wuhan China condone-virus outbreak yet chose to keep quiet.

It has long become the CCP’s creature."
2020-01-31 5:43,"It is likely that this virus was first transmitted to humans at an open hair animal meat market. Many different types of animals are kept in close quarters to one another, and slaughtered on site. It is very unsanitary, and inhumane. This is unacceptable. The animal cruelty is as unacceptable as the risk of virus outbreaks we are seeing. And, the Chinese government is trying to downplay the extent of the outbreak. Inhumane and disgusting."
2020-01-31 5:52,"This article has a great thesis: ‘Xenophobia against the chinese is increasing as the Coronavirus spreads’. But it fails to present convincing evidence. We all have to be cautious of racism directed towards the Chinese as a result of a disease that has afflicted their country. 
However the Toronto example is completely misunderstood. It is logical to want people who have traveled to china to be cleared of having a pandemic contagion. This illness has touched every province of China. I believe every precaution should be exercised in preventing its spread.
Precaution is so much more of a concern when the individuals in question border the outbreak country. People in Bangkok have every reason to avoid chinese tourists. These are people who have traveled straight from the pandemic zone. And yes this is officially a pandemic. The disease has been recognized by the WHO as an international crisis. Neighboring cities such as Hoi An in Vietnam and Seoul in South Korea have every single right to prevent themselves from contracting a deadly disease. 
Racism against the Chinese is most likely going to increase and will become a problem. Racism against Chinese may have even been fomented. But this article provides all the wrong evidence in proving that point."
2020-01-31 5:59,"This article fails to note that many of us, including Hong Kong Chinese, simply have empathy for our citizen neighbors to the north. We completely distrust the ruling CCP hence the agitation about the information being released. The coronavirus has turned everyone in HK against the CCP by proving what many had alleged, no march of 2 million needed."
2020-01-31 6:18,"The reaction of the world to the coronavirus epidemic is not Sinophobic. This is a global health emergency that, like SARS, originated in China. I too lived through the SARS epidemic in Hong Kong, a virus which was attributed to the eating of civets (a wild mongoose like animal) in China. The reality is that to very many people in China the eating of wild animals is a cultural fact. The more exotic the better - endangered songbirds, wolf pups, salamander, bats, porcupines, civets, cobra, yak, rodents, minks and sadly, the gentle, critically endangered pangolin. I have seen restaurants in Beijing where bear paw and camel paw are on the menu. The Chinese government allows 54 wild species to be bred on state-licensed farms and sold for consumption. Of course the government knows about the illegal markets also. Everyone in China does. The Chinese government has just announced a ban on wild animal trade until the crisis is over. What it really needs to do as well is to step up and use its authoritarian power for good by stamping out the breeding, trading and eating of wildlife, not only for global health reasons, but also to save these animals, some of them endangered, from the brutality of these food markets. And while they're at it, they might stamp out the trade in ivory, rhinocerous horn and tiger bones."
2020-01-31 8:13,"Ironic that those in northeast asia who make such statements about the Chinese would likely be treated like them were they to travel abroad. Maybe that's what it would take to learn a little tolerance, and to stop blaming the victims of the Chinese government's penchant for secrecy and control."
2020-01-31 9:54,"People are afraid of a very serious infectious disease for which there is no cure. Some of them, such as the parents of children who attend a school that includes young people who recently returned from China, are concerned for the safety of their children. To equate that with racism is ridiculous, especially since their proposal of these parents pales in comparison with the measures the Chinese government is taking. 
Let's not play the identity politics card at every turn."

2020-01-31 12:37,"I guess we are not as backward as these other countries despite our Muslim ban. Some of these countries or places like Hong Kong are really stirring up old grievances against mainland China due to certain prejudices regarding behavior and other acts they resent from mainland Chinese. Sad that people are not looking for a scientific means to deal with this but fall back on brute prejudice and isolation. And France, of all countries, after getting lots of Chinese tourist revenue over the years have shown their true colors by using the term ""Yellow Alert.""

Maybe the author of this article should refrain from the classic race-based retorts to honest criticism.
Maybe the ""outright anti-Chinese sentiment across the globe."", is actually outright anti-2019-CoronaVirus-started-and-covered-up-in-China sentiment across the globe is what is occurring?
The communist dictators and violators of Human Rights do not have even an acceptable level of transparency when it comes to things that out them in a bad light. SARS? MERS?

Like many other Chinese, I came to know there are people eating bats - and SO MANY other wild animals - in China only very recently. The pictures of bat soup horrified me.

The Wuhan government tried to cover up the disease so that we missed the crucial moment to curb the epidemic at the very beginning. Many Wuhan citizens didn’t know there was this terrible virus and they may be carrying it until after January 20 when government released emergency alerts and the city got locked down. People are angry at the government officials.

People lost their loved ones because of the disease; doctors and nurses are working days and nights under a lot of stress and have to use their masks and disposable coveralls, which are supposed to be used only once, multiple times - because there is a huge lack of medical supplies especially after the lockdown so they have no choice but to clean the overalls and use them again; people from Wuhan have been treated with hostility and rejected from cities, hotels and highways all across the country - some in the end had nowhere to go but to stay on the street in this winter time.

I guess what I’m most angry and sad about this is that many, many of those who are being hurt - those who got the disease, those medical workers risking their lives in the hospital, those being discriminated against, or encountering xenophobia, whatever you may call it - are not those who bought us this disaster."
2020-01-30 13:02,"For the record, I walk away from anyone who coughs on the subway, if the cough is particularly rumbly and not accomplished according to strict school nurse protocol. I just can't see sitting in the direct line of someone else's lung molecules. 

It must be uncomfortable for our Asian neighbors to be singled out, though."
2020-01-30 14:22,"All those taking issue with whomever coughs or sneezes in public thinking it's the result of the Coronavirus, might be forgetting that even under the best circumstances, it's still cold and flu season.
And unfortunately, the current flu strain is not covered by the vaccine. 
No doubt. Tough luck for us all. 
But nothing that hand sanitizer (if one is unable to wash one's hands), a quick escape from anyone who sneezes or coughs (if possible), and a pair of gloves (my favorite) won't fix.
And oh yes, maybe some garlic..."
2020-01-30 16:10,"While the current coronavirus outbreak is certainly something to be aware of, it is not something to be afraid of. Yes, there are a large number of deaths in China, but we must also remember that there is a HUGE number of citizens in China. The percentage is relatively small. Of more concern is an influenza outbreak, in particular because so many refuse/neglect to get immunizations. The flu has caused, both numerically and percentage wise, more deaths that coronavirus. That said, I would also avoid those that appear to be ill (coughing, sneezing). Unfortunately, with mass transit, that can be a daunting task."

2020-02-01 21:33,Thanks for this article.  Earlier coverage of how China initially responded was too complementary to China to be credible.
2020-02-01 22:24,"Wold health organizations, including CDC.. are consistently praising China for both fast reaction to a new novel virus as well as transparency in disclosing their findings.. AND the genome of the virus (which enables a world wide full court press to get a vaccine up and ready)... and of course pundits want to opine up a brush fire. 

Sometimes.. it's better to just stay quiet and let health professionals and governments sort it out.  It requires patience and objectivity though."
2020-02-01 22:57,"If things are that simple, we would be free from flu, cold, and/or infectious diseases.  And we wouldn't have the 2008 Wall Street melt down or the 2018 & 2019 Boeing 737MAX disasters.

In reality, things are very complicated.  Rules and regulations are also deeply intertwined that knowing when to do the right thing is tough. One needs proof to correct the conventional thinking.  Words are useless.  One needs convincing evidence.  Proper communication with evidence in a timely manner requires skill and thoughtfulness in a big governmental organization.   I will not be surprised to see mischief happening in this case.

This is not the first time nor the last time that bad things happen.  We need to look forward to solving this crisis, not blaming the individual, company or government."
2020-02-01 23:02,I’m concerned about the American strategy to contain the virus. At least health authorities should announce that people getting symptoms should put aside any concerns about the insurance  coverage and bills from visiting the Emergency Room. China has declared that all treatment from this virus is free. I’ll bet that visiting an ER will cost more than a plane ticket to China.
2020-02-01 23:12,"This is why China must change course and once again allow civil society to develop. Unless qualified spheres of expertise independent of political command and control are allowed to speak and respond to emergencies everyone is afraid to respond until those really not qualified but have political power issue commands.  China had been making great strides in developing spheres of expertise and independent engagement, but now it is officially forbidden even to mention 'civil society'.  Were the doctors allowed to respond immediately based on their expertise and not waiting for a political officer's approval this scourge could have been checked and many lives saved."
2020-02-01 21:48,"In Wuhan, the sale of the Chinese horseshoe bats at markets as a food may surprise people who have not visited China, but in virtually every city in Central and Southern China items strange to western tastes are eaten. While that practice once probably reflected a paucity of sources of protein in Chinese diets, today when China is much better equipped to feed its population, people buy and eat odd items because of tradition and because they are tasty. Huge fried cockroaches on sticks are enjoyed in the street markets of Shanghai.

Bats as the biggest mammalian source of viral zoonoses for humans, and that fact is critical. 

Westerners know from our literature about Transylvania and the ancient legends of Dracula and vampires. If rabies is the one of the few viruses to which bats have no effective immunity, perhaps that knowledge could lead to design of an effective vaccine against various bat-carried types of coronaviruses.

Was the government of Wuhan too embarrassed about local food practices to stop the outbreak before it threatened people around the world? Apparently, so."
2020-02-01 22:20,"If this doesn’t convince China’s government to shut down those markets once and for all, then nothing ever will.

As another poster commented, this would very likely force the sales of unregulated exotic livestock to go underground as an illegal black market.

If that happens and China still does nothing to curb those activities, then it is intentionally turning a blind eye and another health crisis is sure to be on the horizon.

The WHO has no teeth and is too slow to respond effectively.
Another NY Times article cited a proposal that the WHO institute a tiered alert system that would be much more effective than the all or nothing approach they take now.

It’s like watching smoke billowing from the windows of a burning building and doing nothing until it’s burned down to the ground like poor Notre Dame Cathedral.

But the WHO is a political creature as much as any other, and as the aforementioned article stated, their praise of the Chinese government’s handling of the crisis was “lavish”.

Yes, unfortunately, politics is always #1."
2020-02-01 22:41,"It is totally unacceptable that The Chinese government knowingly endangered the lives of millions of visitors, own citizens and populations across the world when it knew that cases of the Corona virus started being diagnosed in early December 2019 but failed to acknowledge the epidemic until January 20, 2020. This act has further eroded trust in the Chinese government. The international community should send a clear message to the Chinese government that their handling of the initial phase of this emergency was utterly negligent."
2020-02-01 21:24,Informative article on coronavirus from Mr. Buckley and Mr. Myers. Please give us updates on Dr. Li. He should be hailed as a hero for the people of China and I surely this opens their eyes about the government.
2020-02-01 23:14,"Dr. Li's before and after pictures haunt me. As a hospital based physician, I am the first line of defense. I do not want to die for a country that either ignores or takes advantage of physicians' ethics and opinions ( AMA, politicians, lawyers) or decries physicians supposedly huge salaries (regular folks, thinking our many years of education are worthless, and we are to be sued and blamed). This nation grieves over the accidental loss of a millionaire celebrity athlete. Will it grieve over the thousands of doctors and nurses lost in the trenches? Maybe I'll just stockpile meds, water and food, and save my own. Physician, take care of thyself."
2020-02-01 23:14,"Let's see, the article says that the market was closed Jan 1. Then nine days after the market closed, a man who shopped there became the first fatality. It also says that his wife had developed symptoms five days after she did, and she had never visited the market. That shows they knew, as of Jan 9th or 10th, that there was human to human transmission. 

Later on in the article, it says medical workers were getting sick by Dec 25th, more evidence of human to human transmission. But that fact was not acknowledged by the Chinese government until Jan 20th. That's when they finally admitted that one patient had infected at least 14 medical workers. 

So this case is yet another example of the harm caused by government lies and secrecy."
2020-02-01 22:33,"""At critical moments, officials chose to put secrecy and order ahead of openly confronting the growing crisis to avoid public alarm and political embarrassment.""

This has always been China's modus operandi, why is anyone surprised this time around?"
2020-02-01 23:02,"Hardly surprising from my point of view. Why they are being praised by everyone for the response is beyond me. They do not deserve such praise and while no one outside of China has been no reported deaths outside of China as yet, this could have easily been the case as it was with SARS."
2020-02-01 23:05,"For a time, it looked like the Chinese government was going to be a little more open and communicative in the 21st Century.  But, like the Trump Administration, they acted irresponsible, cruel children -- albeit, children with weapons and no morals -- creating, in the end, a larger problem for themselves, and the world."
2020-02-01 21:54,"If there remains any doubt that communism itself is the worst virus in human history, at war against humanity itself, this story, with its parallels to Chernobyl should put such doubts to rest.

Atavistic hardliners in China seem to believe that they can pocket the benefits of modernity and treat their people like cattle.   

When was the last time an important country has had so many disasters in one year, all due to the political incompetence built in to their ideology?"
2020-02-01 22:33,"What a timely illustration of what happens when the party line trumps inconvenient truths, when dishonesty in politics is tolerated.

A lesson for all Republicans."
2020-02-01 22:20,"Easy to ""arm chair this from pundit land..particularly with the typical anti-China government rant.  Yet you are fine with the CDC and WHO dragging feet to react to some pretty timely and transparent data on the virus and it's genome (in record time by the way.. and much much faster than back in SARS timelines. 

Fact is.. it took some time to A) identify that a new virus was at play here, and 2) to have kits that could test for it...because you first must isolate and identify the genome.. and then produce tests that react to it. First cases were not confirmed by definitive testing until around the 19th of January. 

Keep in mind.. people get sick all the time with cold like or flu like virus.. even in China.. and especially in winter season. 

/eyeroll."
2020-02-01 23:51,A senior scientist in my country who has significant responsibility for dealing with this virus was very positive in praise of how China reacted. I'll take his word for it.
2020-02-02 0:02,"But didn’t Trump tweet that China was handling it just fine? Hasn’t he also cut the public health budget? And as for Chinese authoritarianism- how about rule by the rich in the US, with a pretence of meaningful democracy?"
2020-02-02 0:06,"If the United States still has a clear chain of command for pandemic response, the White House urgently needs to clarify what it is—not just for the public but for the government itself, which largely finds itself in the dark.

In 2018, the Trump administration fired the government’s entire pandemic response chain of command, including the White House management infrastructure. 

In numerous phone calls and emails with key agencies across the U.S. government, the only consistent response [Foreign Policy Magazine] encountered was distressed confusion."
2020-02-02 0:08,"The response is typical in China, at first try to sweep it under the rug and hope it goes away and then when it doesn’t, act with over the top draconian measures like cutting off an entire city.  Dare I say both responses are based more on politics than on science.  Nonetheless, Chinese society is starting to wake up to their systems shortcomings and there is a genuine political will to fix these amongst both the top leaders and the population at large.  

It’s impossible for a country of 1.4 billion people to do everything right all the time.  I think what they are doing now, however, is trying their best.  This is more than I can say for the Senate of my own country."
2020-02-02 0:29,"Small clusters of viral illnesses are not uncommon.  I have two relatives who were infected in different years by viruses in central Alberta.  Both ended up with a disability and one died prematurely.  My physician also had a patient who died of a rare viral illness that was part of a cluster (statistical anomaly or communicable was unknown).   We can hardly go to  WHO level emergency every time a new viral illness emerges in a cluster of fewer than 10 patients (all of the three aforementioned clusters were under 10 patients, occurred in Alberta, Canada and did not prompt public warnings).

What we can do is tell the Chinese government that these live, multi species meat markets need to be shut down permanently."
2020-02-02 1:06,"Since most of the funding has been cut for US response to a pandemic, a lot of people are going to be suffering as this runs it's course.  It's only the beginning of it here.  I don't think we can predict the severity, but people should start brushing up on their hand washing skills.  Especially those who have compromised immune systems (young, elderly and those with other serious health issues)."
2020-02-02 1:12,"There will be plenty of time to examine what China did wrong and what China did right.  But at this time our attention should be focused on examining our own weaknesses when it comes to dealing with this disease and with emerging diseases in general.  

Even with full knowledge of the situation, I read yesterday that a person had returned from to San Jose from Wuhan without being put in quarantine.  What's worse, he had been sent home after seeking help for a respiratory problem at a clinic/emergency room, during which time he   obviously exposed people.  That seems like criminal negligence to me.

What, for example, are our plans for dealing with the homeless during a pandemic?  Mini-cities within our largest population centers who are living in the open in crowded, unsanitary  conditions with no toilets, no plans for identifying and isolating them, no easy way to identify their contacts, etc.  This is a disaster in the making for the homeless and for the larger population.  

What are our own plans?  What are we doing wrong?"
2020-02-02 1:19,"I am surprised that anyone thinks it is a surprise that China did anything except what they did. There are no examples of China having been transparent on anything to date so more of the same should have been the expectation. 

Unfortunately I also think it very likely that many other nations would have been in the same net predicament, just that the underlying reasons for inaction would be different."
2020-02-02 1:07,"Nothing must be allowed to threaten the Chinese Communist Party dictatorship of the Chinese proletariat.

I lived in mainland China several years back. When I asked why Mao, who killed many millions of Chinese in the name of the People, was still revered and why his crimes were not better known, my informant, a university student in engineering, told me, Mao is our Jesus. We must never criticize him.

Totalitarian dictatorships value absolute power over everything else.

Tough thing, they (we) can never control Nature.

I hope that this will lead to such instability that the Chinese people will begin to weaken and finally destroy their government.

Communism has only brought misery wherever it has been."
2020-02-02 0:47,Enough of China and their hideous live meat markets.  There needs to be intense international pressure to shut them down or the world needs to treat China as the pariah that it is.
2020-02-01 23:33,"Wasn't this supposed to be China's century?? China is a danger to the world,  they suppress ideas and information, they use their vast wealth to buy corrupt officials in 3rd world countries and then when they can't pay, they own them. This open air market has zero standards of accountability for health and safety and it was a wonderful laboratory for breeding a new super bug. what a great Chinese century this will be!!"
2020-02-01 23:59,"There was an AP article today about a student at Wuhan University who went home to his village for the holidays.  He had a cold and went to a hospital to have it checked out and the doctors told him he didn't have the virus.  Five days afterward police descended on his home and he is now under house arrest. He is under constant surveillance, checked three times a day, had his phone camera disabled, photos deleted and messages monitored.  If stories like this get out via social media then you will have a significant percentage of sick people that won't go to the hospital under any circumstance.  The people in charge seem to only have hammers and they aren't very good with those."
2020-02-01 23:28,"An excellent article, which read like the script of a documentary.  Hopefully the novel coronavirus may not be Big One, the pandemic virus, but what if it is?  The delays would have had catastrophic consequences.  

Xi Jinping wants no decentralized decision making.  Will he make the necessary changes to prevent a repeat of the frightening scenario described in the article?  I really doubt it."
2020-02-02 0:52,"There is a great deal of irony in the attempt by the Chinese government and communist party to hide the truth about the virus, and attacking people trying to tell the truth.   If the Chinese government and communist party had been open about the disease and taken steps to control it early on, they would have been heroes for stopping/moderating a disease event and possibly preventing an epidemic.  Being open about having discovered, and immediately attempted to contain, a unique new virus would have given them respect and recognition throughout the world.  Now, they have created an economic and humanitarian crisis that is going to reverberate and reflect negatively on them for decades."
2020-02-01 23:54,"10% of Americans have no health insurance, and many more have such high deductibles and/or need to travel to get to quality care that they don't go to doctors until they're in dire straits. Are we ready for this to come to America?"
2020-02-02 0:04,"A  government which tries to control everything, including the dissemination of news and important information damages the best efforts of its own population.

The Chinese government is paranoid about loss of control, That said, despite mistakes, it has taken some huge steps in a short time.

Our own government is not formed in the mold of the Chinese Communists, but it has attempted to silence its own scientists and other experts for political reasons.  And we have an administration which spews it's own version of reality, reminiscent of  regimes who do not share our democratic ideals.  How are we to be sure that a doctor or health worker who discovered a major threat, one which would alarm the population,  would be allowed to go public?  ( Consider:Even in the 1950's total silence was imposed over the knowledge that people in Utah and Nevada had been exposed to radioactive fallout.)

 Right now, I do not believe that the US itself  is prepared for a pandemic with high mortality rates (at this early time, the mortality rates do not seem high.) I guess we cross our fingers.  And hope that anyone with alarming information isn't prohibited from going public, because the info is ""classified"" or would cause a panic."
2020-02-01 23:32,The epidemic sounds like it was from tainted pork.  In recent months the Trump administration said it was going to remove inspectors in America’s pork processing plants and allow the companies to inspect themselves    It doesn’t take a scientist to understand why it is dangerous to mess around with food inspections. Let’s hope our country reverts back to stringent inspections very soon.

Unfortunately the rest of the world will now reap the consequences as well.  If China is so concerned about saving face, then they need to change their way of doing business. Open markets full of wild animals, with no use of hygiene or refrigeration are breeding grounds of future pestilence. If the Chinese authorities did not learn their lesson from SARS, it looks like the rest of the world will need to pressure China to change for our own sake."
2020-02-01 23:22,It’s too early to come into a verdict. Let’s see how other parts of the world handle this crisis and who is the worst.
2020-02-02 1:09,"This is a wake-up call.  So few people in our country understand or even care how little the Beijing government cares about its citizens in relation to its own will for survival.  Local officials in municipalities throughout China tend to be even more self-interested and corrupt.  Yes, the government seems to be more on the ball now with this virus, but where obfuscation is the norm, you truly never know.

We as a country should obsess just a bit less over our own culture wars, no matter how entertaining or captivating or emotionally-charging, and instead try to grasp the very real threat the mafioso CCP poses to democracy and freedom everywhere through widespread spying and technology theft, misinformation, cheating on trade, economic bullying in developing countries, human rights abuses, and on and on. 

The New York Times and other media, as well as our research universities--increasingly open to inadequately vetted Chinese influence--must be vigilant against the CCP's preferred strategy of framing criticism of its dubious practices as ""China-bashing"" or ""anti-Chinese racism."""
2020-02-01 23:54,"They didn't do it alone.  They have been able to co-opt the WHO which they did, right from the start.  Firstly, by stopping them from calling the virus anything related to Wuhan or China, right through to continuing to strong arm Taiwan out of the WHO.  They forced the WHO and CDC not to differentiate Taiwan's infection rates with those of China.  

The WHO allowed the Chinese government to ""contain"" the outbreak whilst denying that there was any real danger, all the while more than 10,000 travellers left Wuhan and travelled throughout Asia, Australia and North America, before the beginning of Chinese New Year.  

China will do what China always does, which is deflect, deny and dissemble.  However, in order to really make it stick they need a puppet organization, which they have found in the WHO and more recently, our very own CDC."
2020-02-02 0:03,"Nothing will change. After this crisis is over, I hope it is soon, some party officials will lose their positions, but the system will remain intact. The system may even become stronger, as the authority will see the cracks from this crisis and rush to repair those system cracks. 
While medical crisis is acute, and food supply is major concern, NYT should report some human/animal  rights violations during the epidemic. Private information (ID number, phone, address) get spread around, people's pets get killed, people are not allowed to return to their homes, and sick people are left to die. Many of stories are not even in Wuhan, instead, they are in other places with much fewer cases. Chinese social media is full of those wrenching stories, and people are crying for help.
I also hope the American society will treat Chinese students, immigrants, visitors, and people who travelled there with some dignity. They are not virus. Many are working hard to help, and they should not be shunned or isolated."
2020-02-01 23:49,Is President Xi wearing a mask?
2020-02-02 1:05,Just like the Russians with Chernobyl. Why am I  not surprised?
2020-02-02 1:38,"On the science and clinical side, China has done just fine; actually amazing considering that 2 hospitals built from scratch will shortly be receiving patients.  Their scientists rather quickly were able to discover and reveal the genome of the virus.  It appears that their clinicians are providing up to date care to hospitalized patients. They are already contributing to medical journal articles about what they are doing which will enlighten clinicians world-wide.  It's on the ideological side, the political side where there's been the catastrophic behavior.  We are obviously not to that point in US but this Administration has already shown how political and religious ideology can be promoted over science in America and likely more is to come."
2020-02-01 22:11,"At the end of this, the government will blame a few ""bad apple"" for mishandling the crisis while the problem really is structural. It's just how these things go in China (or any authoritarian regimes). As long as the system remains in place, this sort of crisis will always be just beyond the horizon. It is no coincidence that some of the worst human health crisis in the modern era (e.g., Chernobyl, Sars) happened where they happened."
2020-02-02 1:41,"I’m surprised the article didn’t contain Javier Hernandez’s reporting, which he mentioned on The Daily podcast, in which he followed a family with an older woman who fell ill and then died. The doctors at the hospital refused outright to test her body to find out the cause of death or if she had the coronavirus. However, they said the body had to be cremated right away. 

How many other people who potentially died of the coronavirus were also not tested and therefore not included in the official death count?

China’s policy of censorship and propaganda, and its rank at the bottom among countries in the world for a free press was always going to bite them where it hurt. Looks like that time has come."
2020-02-02 2:13,"It may be easy to criticize with the benefit of hindsight. Perhaps a confidential doctors’ communication network by means of which doctors across the country could be told of any pressing concerns in the field might be created.

In the event of a possible outbreak, perhaps people could be told of unconfirmed rumors unlikely true and not to be spread – and that travel should be curtailed while Government authorities conduct research?"
2020-02-02 2:28,"If a similar situation (early days of the coronavirus epidemic in China) were to occur in the US during the midst of the Christmas shopping season, would our government try to downplay its severity, for fear of ruining the economy? Just wondering."

2020-02-02 2:30,A sadly un-surprising headline and one that underscores that in an interconnected world freedom of the press and speech is more important than ever which is why standing up for democracy will never go out of style.
2020-02-02 2:34,"Great reporting, but let us not think for a minute that leaping into action earlier would have prevented this from spreading - it would only have slowed it. As anyone who knows can attest, what makes this virus as bad as it is, is the singular and uncommon ability to be transmitted curing incubation which effectively makes quarantine almost like shutting the barn door after the horse has bolted.  I would like to point out that WHO was notified early on, and that the statements from Chinese health officials about the infectious nature during incubation were dismissed by our top experts in the USA as ""highly unlikely"". It wouldn't be until a German paper said it was so that it was believed. So let us be clear, the WHO knew of it early enough on, and even after China stated it was unique in its ability to spread during incubation the W.H.O. STILL did not declare an Emergency. So who now is not acting quickly enough? Because the measures we've instigated will not be enough."
2020-02-02 2:35,"Full disclosure is not always called for That’s why some information is classified or confidential  We opted for full disclosure about Ebola  and Chris Christie turned the disease into a political  football, violating the rights of health care workers. Confidentiality is often the better course."

2020-02-02 1:43,"As someone else noted - this is much like the USSR's behavior in relation to the Chernobyl disaster. 

The People's Republic of China is a threat to its neighbors, a threat to democracy, and, as this event shows (as well as its long history of human rights abuses - the internment of Uyghur muslims being the tip of the iceberg) a danger to its own citizenry. It is high time that our elected representatives treated it as such when it comes to foreign policy, trade and national security. 

With state-sponsored businesses like Huawei making significant inroads in the critical communications infrastructure of our chief ally, the UK, there is no time to waste. The PRC is the #1 existential threat to democracy and the progressive values of our time."
2020-02-02 2:02,"‘Politics is Always No. 1’ says it all. Even while the US, Japan, EU, Australia and others are evacuating their citizens from the ground zero, Wuhan, China refuses to let Taiwan evacuates it’s citizens. China also prevented Taiwan from participating in a recent World ℍ𝕖𝕒𝕝𝕥𝕙 Organization’s emergency conference concerning the spread of the virus. Taiwan, an important international hub, can not get information from WHO directly because of Chinese interference. Taiwan, with its excellent medical expertise, can not contribute to help with the world’s epidemics. All these make the world less safe. But to China, its politics is more important than humanity."

2020-02-02 1:57,"It has also led to hysteria in China as well. Too secretive and I just read an article where some citizen Joe Bloggs videoed inside a Chinese hospital and got arrested and videos confiscated but was allowed to keep his cellphone.

2020-02-02 2:32,"Let us walk away from the embarrassing political gamble of the Chinese authorities and ask China how can the world help to prevent the invasive spread of the Corona virus. 

Now that the world is petrified that going to China would be a dangerous self endangerment and it will be I predict at least 6 months before China can declare itself free of the Wuhan Corona virus spread, how can we help fight the new virus spread.

One possibility is for the US center for disease control (CDC) in Atlanta become a global coordination center to stay in communication with China for receiving information and sending scientifically verified critical information back to China. CDC has the highest containment facilities and has been entrusted with deadly virus stocks like the variola virus stocks and all strains of influenza and many many other viral and microbial stocks. The CDC should also develop a rapid capacity to screen promising antivirals as well as send to where ever they be needed and be ready to become the 1st responders in case the spread gets out of hand. 

With no vaccine in sight and no reproducibly reliable treatment specific against the new virus being close to being deployed any previous scientifically proven broad spectrum antiviral treatment needs to be deployed immediately after CDC allows the testing of candidates that are likely to provide an advantage to a person exposed to the virus to clear the virus. I remember sending antivirals to St. Jude to test against H5N1."

2020-02-02 2:30,Our politicians do the same to our scientists.  Physician heal thyself.
2020-02-02 2:03,"There's a video that was confiscated by the Chinese police, taken by a Chinese citizen, of what is really happening inside the hospital. It was taken without the communist governments permission . The guy was allowed to keep his cellphone and has taken photos of what's happening inside the hospital.
Apparently there's a hunt on to find the first person who contacted the virus as they need them so as to find a new vaccine to get rid of the virus. Good luck with that! When this first started there were reliable reports coming out of China that the government was secretly cremating bodies."
2020-02-02 2:42,"This is not ""news""  -- this is all we should expect, and, more to the point -  all China's own population expects from their government."
2020-02-02 2:41,"If the Chinese communists were as adept at responding to medical emergency and saving lives as they are at censoring information and hiding the truth, China would be an admirable country instead of the danger to the world that it has become."
2020-02-02 2:56,"I really love my friends and co-workers from China and Asia in general. But, there is a profound cultural difference that manifests itself in less open communications, less directness that in some situations is beneficial for the social order, and in situations like this, potentially disastrous.  I would be over simplifying by saying that it is related to the notion of ""saving face"" but I can't think of a better way of putting it to people who may not be as close the the Asian mindset.  It is not really productive, in my opinion. to try to cast this as some kind of Chinese government repression in an overt sense, but ultimately, that is how the culture expresses itself."
2020-02-02 2:54,Why is anyone surprised by this?  Isn’t this what they do every time a disease breaks out there?
2020-02-02 2:36,"Our own political parties and our own newspapers are not admitting that this coronavirus is a pan endemic involving the world not China alone. China moved into quarantine all citizens in the city were the illness started and the quarantine is quite humane and the doctors are educating now and if they did not start immediately to talk- they are doing the right thing now. In the quarantine the people can only go out of their apartments with a mask for breathing  to buy groceries at certain times.  The World Health organization has commended China how they are organizing.  
Meanwhile the political leaders of Washington DC they are forgetting or not willing to discuss the possible pan epidemic.  

Question: who trusts Trump at such a problem?  We are looking for a leader who listens well, reads well, welcomes several different solutions and has respect for science.

Mike Bloomberg has delt several rounds of managing a city several billion size big and he has managed well.  Don't turn him off because he is a billionaire - but welcome the money as it will be needed to beat Trump especially since he know Trump he will beat him.

Can you vision Trump figuring out quarantine - him who could not manage the southern US border ."
2020-02-02 2:57,"Good article!  I am reflecting  on 2009 H1N1 Pandemic which was first detected in the U.S. and finally killed over 12 thousand American people and over 210 thousand people worldwide.

Even in a democratic system, should our government have done a better job to contain the virus and reduced the staggering fatality?  Corrupted  Bureaucracy could be as lethal as the virus."
2020-02-02 3:04,"We should view this story as allegory for where we, the US and the rest of the workd are headed as the populist, autocratic wave takes hold. What may seem as inconceivable behavior from the Chinese government may actually not be too far away for us at all. After all, if the US Senate has chosen to hide the truth about a corrupt POTUS from the people, does our government reasonably hold higher ground when it comes to truthful narratives?"
2020-02-02 3:11,"What can shut down a country like China and bring it to its knees?  Is it tariffs?  Is it human rights violations?  Is it suppression of free speech?  No!  It is a disease outbreak with no cure or vaccine.  Political leaders globally ignore public health and communicable diseases at their peril.  

America has a Prevention and Public Health fund as part of the ACA, originally slated for $2 billion.  It is now less than half that amount and most of the public health programs are zeroed out in Trump's budget proposal.   We spend only spend only 1-2% of health care dollars on prevention and public health.  The rest is spent supporting our overly bureaucratic and dysfunctional health care system.  So is America ready for something like a coronavirus?  Sadly, the answer is too obvious."
2020-02-02 3:32,"Thank you for this very informative, well written article.
""We didn't know..."" is a slippery slope when it comes to public health.  ""We knew but we didn't tell you..."" can become an avalanche."
2020-02-02 3:47,"Wuhan, love the town, lived there once, but the accusation should be aimed much higher.

 China is a decomposed entity with much of the motive force concentrated at the regional level as is its corruption. But who advances up through the system is always decided by those above often at the next level.

In recent years that peck order greatly tightened, stating in 2012 and Wuhan not the first example – “…should I disturb the Boss? “

Not a uniquely Chinese problem, and in China’s defense the unsanitary conditions that fed this virus have been regulated in the hundreds of thousands on markets across the land by the FDA equivalent in the country since the days of SARS."
2020-02-02 3:49,"It is a shame the Chinese made mistakes,  but come on, they did amazing work, notified the WHO, published the sequence, sealed a city and now we have a chance to keep it under control. They have been publishing articles telling us so much information. Thank you Chinese health care workers and scientists!!"
2020-02-02 3:54,"Let's put aside politics for a little while. 

I was curious what the standard procedures are in the US if a doctor finds what s/he considers as a mysterious and potentially highly contagious disease? To put the information on the social media first or to report to the CDC or other agencies or hospitals to further investigate the disease? 

Here are the timelines for the events, according to the article.
On 12/30, Dr. Li shared his story in his social media among his friends. He received warnings from City health officials on the same day and then from police 3 days later.
On 12/31, the Chinese national health authorities notified WHO's Beijing office of possible outbreak. 
On 1/1, Wuhan local government and health officials closed the market. 
On 1/7, Chinese scientists determined the genetic makeup of the virus and shared it with scientific community worldwide. 
On 1/18, the central government sent Dr. Zhong to Wuhan to further assess the situation.
On 1/20, Dr. Zhong made open announcement on national TV about the disease. 
On 1/23, Wuhan city started its lockdown. ...

You may say that the government and health officals could have done better here or there, but considering the sensitivity of the issue, I am not sure whether I would call the responses as a failure or a coverup (put aside the politics)."
2020-02-02 2:20,"I was in New York Medical College studying for an MPH in the early 1980s during the height of the 'Gay Disease'.  Managing information and monitoring media response to an unknown pathogen is both difficult and necessary.  Biological science and epidemiology take time and are difficult to effectively communicate to the public. U.S. media coverage and political posturing during the early years of HIV was certainly problematic.
China's response to the current virus is certainly flawed, but not in the least surprising or unprecedented in similar public health challenges."
2020-02-02 3:57,"Thank you to the NYTImes for once again great reporting.  Along with the Chinese government  failing to identify and report on this disease when it was, perhaps, still containable, I fault WHO for not acting sooner rather than later.  As always, as cited, there are ""economic ramifications"" to be considered....as opposed to human lives.  

Just an aside, years ago on my first trip to China I told my guide I wanted to visit the night markets.  He said OK, do so, but DO NOT EAT ANYTHING...and after visiting I understood why."
2020-02-02 3:58,"Swine flu originated in the US, infected up to 21% of the global community, and killed around 550,000 people.  The failure of the US to aggressively tackle the disease in the early stages is one factor that contributed to this toll.

While China’s response has not been perfect, it has nonetheless done far more than any other country has in history to tackle a virus at this stage.  Perhaps we should thank the Chinese and provide assistance & encouragement instead of throwing rocks for every real and perceived stuff up."
2020-02-02 4:02,"Dear NYT, may I object to this headline? Secrecy and the use of fear are features of authoritarian, unelected regimes - they are not ‘habits.’ The corrective mechanisms and crucial transparency that largely come into play in democracies during crises are absent in undemocracric countries like China, Iran, Saudi Arabia and many others. Here in Australia, the response to the bushfire crisis has been diametrically opposite, because of a free press, the need of elected politicians to retain their seats at the next election, and public action without fear of being targeted by rulers. We used to be able to state these distinctions unambiguously about the Soviet Bloc. Now, the language of the press has become muddled and effete in a culture saturated with the fear of appearing politically incorrrect when discussing authoritarian regimes. This is a big loss, as it’s a reflection of a loss within us that we need to understand before it completely eats away at our ability to be strong in the face of things that we used to have no doubt need to be resisted."
2020-02-02 4:19,"If this had happened in the us- would the authorities have the capability of isolating a city of 11 million people? Say Chicago? Would the government be able to stop trains, planes and automobiles carrying people from leaving the city? Would people listen to the government and shelter in place to prevent the spread of the virus or would they think- stuff that- I’m out of here. It’s an interesting hypothesis and fruit for consideration Re options if a disease of this nature (and it’s current mortality  is less than the annual flu virus) were to occur in the USA."
2020-02-02 4:36,"I have been to India 7 times, and unlike China, has no infrastructure or facilities to respond once this is unleashed there.  It is not if, it is when.
   I have listened to enough doctors and epidemioligists to sense that that the contagiousness of this particular strain is like nothing the world has ever seen. And , like unwitting agents of doom , the airline industry could be brought to its knees. The best planes recirculate 50% of the air, and it goes down from there. If air travel is brought to a halt worldwide, this will have a ripple effect on economies and business that will result in worldwide catastrophe, even, though the death ratio for this unusual virus seems to be a quarter of what it was with SARS. If millions of people get it, there is no telling what might transpire. Doesn't it make you feel warm and fuzzy that we have Donald Trump to guide us through this mess in the US?"
2020-02-02 4:49,"This is an outstanding example of what happens when politicians and political considerations override scientific evidence and public health priorities.

But please pay attention: this is NOT unique to China!"
2020-02-02 5:07,"I'd like to see a detailed map and death toll of the average Flu season or pneumonia compared to this. (hint*it kills more people)

We live in an age of too much information.

Anxiety. Anxiety. Anxiety. Over things you can't control.

Even governments are now victim to the perils knowing too much and looking good on social media."
2020-02-02 5:58,"To the authors of this detailed reporting,  thank you.  It is reckless on the part of leaders and government in China to have suppressed information.  The whole world is impacted.  This is a lesson for us as well.  Reading this report,  we see weakness or the lack of proper rules and guidelines on hygiene and sanitation.  This is a matter that requires urgent intervention by a world body, such as the UN to have China address and correct the drawbacks. If China has to deal with the outside world,  they have to play by the rules, and insure proper implementation and necessary follow up."
2020-02-02 6:06,"I had a bad feeling about this because I don't trust  China. Then, two days into this news I read a social media post of one of the people I follow, who happens to be Chinese living in the U.S. He posted that the virus is much bigger than being reported, that the cases were in the thousands, not dozens (which was being reported at the time). I fully believed him. Now, look where we're at. This scares me more because I knew they weren't taking proper precautions from the start and now it is going to be hitting college campuses. My closest friends work on a college campus. This will spread everywhere because proper precautions were not taken. They should have isolated the infected, in place, at once."
2020-02-02 6:08,"When you have people the world over still foraging for and eating bushmeat, you have the recipe for a global disaster.  Add in the ease with which we hop a plane and travel the world over, the speed of the contagion is staggering.

This could and will happen anywhere.  Parts of the world are experiencing glacier melt and warmer than normal weather.  We have no idea what viruses we're unleashing this way.

We're responsible for this problem.  All of us.  We need to realize and accept this and take drastic measures to protect the population of the world.  We must work together, across all geo-political boundaries.  

If we put our heads in the sand, if we refuse to work together, a disaster of monumental proportions is just around the corner.  And, the culling will begin."
2020-02-02 6:27,"It was very useful to see this complete timeline. The lesson is not just for China. Public officials often believe that their primary responsibility is to reassure the public, to prevent panic, until it is clear that action is warranted. We saw this after 9/11 when EPA head Christie Todd Whitman, based on no real evidence, declared that the air at ground-zero was safe to breathe. Public officials need to learn this lesson; resist the urge to reassure, and instead act as quickly as possible to shed light on the situation in order to provide useful information to the public."
2020-02-02 6:32,"Not surprised that the Chinese government behaved this way. My concern is with our government, this administration does not give one confidence they will respond for the good of its citizens. Look at Puerto Rico, did they help there? Look at Ca fires- they helped Russian fire fighters.  At what point do Republican constituents hold their president accountable? Hope ""all the best people"" are addressing the problem and not just spinning about it."
2020-02-02 6:40,"Secrecy?   History repeats itself.  When  SARs  broke out, the  Internet was getting established.  Social, political, and cultural entrepreneurs in the West were pleased in assuming the Internet would ""democratize"" China and the Chinese people would find gradual convergence with the West.  The  democratizing technology would loosen the Party's grip.  As  Net activity exploded with the SARs panic, all kinds of views went viral.   Nothing ""official"" emerged.   The people were in panic.  As was the Party.   Nobody had reliable information.  But the massive proliferation of Net access for  the Chinese population--mainly in urban areas that had Internet Cafes--revealed a fundamental reality: the Party had lost control over the population's discourse--grounds for authoritarian  panic.  What happened?  The Party began to systematically shut down Internet Cafes.  The excuse?  Youth corruption via pornography and video games.  Cafe's were dangerous, not hygiene.  But the real reason was to establish authoritarian control.  The Internet would return but only after well-established FIREWALLS..   Now the Party has control.  The paralysis of silence -- for purposes of dealing with Party unease--is what the silencing strategies signify.  A genuine public sphere is what the Party struggles to prevent.   Public discourse and global health clash with Party preservation, a a worldly visible and  sad contradiction."
2020-02-02 6:55,"Science is a great way to gain understanding of phenomena that is a mystery. But it requires being open and exposed to other’s reactions to ones efforts to understand. Trust and generous sharing are virtues in science. Secrecy prevents this and can even lead to pursuing efforts that prove futile and which might have been avoided. Paranoid systems like China’s end up being second or third rate when it comes to science, generally. China’s secrecy about diseases like this one wastes time and costs lives."
2020-02-02 7:07,"China is not an Open Society. The idea of Open Society originated by Aspasia married to Athenian politician Pericles:
“Our city is thrown open to the world… free to live exactly as we please, and yet, we are always ready to face any danger.... although only a few may originate a policy, we are all able to judge it. We do not look upon discussion as a stumbling block in the way of political action, but as an indispensable preliminary to acting wisely.”

Debate is crucial for advancing understanding. Debating with oneself is indispensable, but debating with others enables one to go where none thought of.

Instead in a dictatorship, few decide; maximal potential brain power is reduced, or minute. Actually it’s the multi-debating aspect of Western Europe which enabled most of the advancement of civilization in the last millennium. China, which used to be very advanced scientifically and technologically missed the debating aspect, motivated by mighty intellectual passions. This is the main problem of Confucius philosophy, which views the respect of one’s “station” in life, the most important feature of society. Hence Confucius is most compatible with Xi’s regime. 

Whereas intellectual debate and its descendants, in particular scientific, medical and technological advancement, are the exact opposite: they respect only truth, and, more generally, the search thereof. To equal the West, China will have to accept to see truths be hurled, and love thereof, be hurled around."
2020-02-02 7:28,"Novel Coronavirus Wuhan 2019  is a very big health problem.  Highly contagious with an approximate 2% fatality rate. No current vaccine. and only ""promising medicines"" that might be useful.

 I guess that one can use energy to criticize local officials for not reporting index cases several days earlier in December 2019.    But the response was actually very rapid with the Chinese Central government acknowledging an Epidemic on December 31, 2019.  This is much more rapid than the years it took the US to acknowledge the HIV epidemic, more rapid than it took to the Chinese to acknowledge SARS (months), and more rapid than it took the World to acknowledge Ebola (months).

I think our energy is better spent on figuring out how to contain this epidemic.  They shut down the market much like John Snow shut down the London well in the 1800's to contain a cholera epidemic--Good. They have quarantined populations with the intent of  preventing  further spread of the disease--also Good.

Now doing World wide led clinical trials to see if protease inhibitors will work in ameliorating the disease==also good.

So currently this coronavirus induced disease is much more of a medical problem now than it is a political problem.   I plan to use my energy to focus on the public health and medical aspects of this new human disease."
2020-02-02 10:24,"This is what typically happens in undemocratic societies where political power is concentrated at the very top and the truth is not allowed to surface where corrective actions could have taken place in a more timely, organized, and effective manner. And given Trump's peculiar affection for dictatorships, our democracy has been under stress where real facts and policies are being hidden from public view. These are strange times indeed."
2020-02-02 10:40,"I am dismayed by the lack of understanding displayed by the headline, article and comments as to the difference between local and federal government. We say “China” but the examples and interviews in the article are about local response in one province in the early days of the epidemic. This has apparently opened all doors for people to air out any and all grievances about a whole country, instead of highlighting the real story- a striking insecurity and lack of trust on the local level in fear of higher powers in the Chinese central government. 

I am holding any praise for how they are managing this epidemic, as the dust has yet to settle, but the central government’s extreme push toward quarantine and hospital-building honestly seems to be as much as any government in this situation can do."
2020-02-02 11:03,"What are the chances of this virus hitching a ride on the multitude of products shipped fom China to the rest of the world? Is stopping passenger flights sufficient to curtail the spread of this disease or do cargo shipments by air, rail, and water also need to be restricted?"
2020-02-02 11:21,When you read about the reaction of the Chinese authorities you cannot but associate it to the reaction the soviets had during the Chernobyl disaster. For the communist regime the image (of communism) to the outside world is more important not just than the public interest put also than reality. That policy is strictly followed until the disaster is obvious and nearly inevitable.
2020-02-02 11:29,"China for decades has been cheating on trade, pumps more toxins into the air than any other country and is woefully behind developed nations in public safety, and their growing middle class is demanding more from their leaders. Trump is proving the most effective president in decades addressing trade by going after them where it counts: exports. This virus debacle will hopefully get Chinese citizens to demand changes to their food and health practices."
2020-02-02 12:20,This story defines journalism. We are fortunate to have The Times looking out for the interests of all people. And I am particularly impressed by the army of Chines staff researchers who are credited at the end of the story. Well done.
2020-02-02 12:25,"In part, yes the political situation and extensive censorship in China contributed to the spreading of the virus. In part, and in my opinion the greater part, it was due to human nature, something we share too. If any of us had been confronted with similar scenarios, would be have immediately ordered a city lockdown, as we perhaps like to think? Or would we have convinced ourselves of the best case scenario, not wanting to see the extent of the issue until it became impossible to be in denial about? I think it is important to be more realistic about how humans respond to such issues and not use this tragedy as a political critic...."
2020-02-02 12:58,"We know how the Chinese government handles such crises -- cloaked in secrecy and putting communist ideology over its people. No surprises there.

Is Times planning a continuing coverage on what is our government's plan to this emergency? That's what I am more interested in.

I hope there is more to our plan than just stopping flights coming from China."
2020-02-02 12:59,"People just don't get the scale of this problem. it isn't the flu. it isn't like the flu. The flu virus dies from fever and antibodies even without treatment. The flu has treatments like tamaflu. The flu has vaccines to prevent it. Coronavirus may never die. it can recur and flair up like herpes. a flair up in the lungs is atypical pneumonia. if you aren't strong enough, you die from pneumonia. This version of Coronavirus spreads easily and is spreading exponentially. Far more people than known already have it because the gestation period is several days before you experience symptoms. so eventually everyone gets it and as we age, we weaken, and so eventually we die from pneumonia. it probably means human life expectancy just dropped by 10-15 years if we don't develop treatments and vaccines."
2020-02-02 13:12,"""On the last day of 2019, after Dr. Li’s message was shared outside the group, the authorities focused on controlling the narrative. The police announced that they were investigating eight people for spreading rumors about the outbreak.""

When I reached that statement in the article, it took my breath away. The chilling similarity of the reaction of those local Chinese authorities to the reactions of the current U.S. president when he's confronted with an ""inconvenient truth"" is both astounding and profoundly unsettling."
2020-02-02 13:34,"So far we have not heard the number of persons diagnosed with the virus who have recovered.  So far, many thousand cases confirmed, so far many hundred deaths.  When will we learn the recovery rate?
Early detection and isolation is not enough.  The media would salve public anxiety if we knew that treatment and care will lessen the impact.  Further it cannot be stressed enough that vaccination once available should be mandatory."
2020-02-02 12:28,"My brother in law, who is from Taiwan but lives half the year in California, called my wife yesterday morning asking my wife if she could buy some masks as they’re unavailable in California. We looked around here and they’re all sold out. Moreover, online, people are asking for high prices. Panic is setting in."
2020-02-02 3:24,"I'm discouraged, though not surprised, to see the many references to US politics in these comments so far.

Anyone who knows -- to the extent we can know in their opacity -- how the Communist dictatorship works in China, will be very pleased at the ugly state of affairs we have in the US. We don't have a dictator, though his haters like to refer to him like that. And we don't have oppressive totalitarians who want to stifle voices, though both sides accuse the others of being them.

Our ugly, messy democracy is alive and very well. We are in the midst of ructions we've caused ourselves, but we're using the democratic tools people much more wise than our current leaders gave us 200+ years ago to fight it out.

The dictators in Beijing, Moscow, Teheran, and elsewhere are the real deals, very bad people who oppress and kill to stifle any dissent, let alone the very alive dissent we have today.

Making comparisons between the very bad guys in these places and the Americans in the US who are fighting tooth and nail over domestic politics is ludicrous and makes it harder to ultimately work through our own disputes. All we do with our own internecine brawls is help the kind of people this article is about. Time to stop that, on both sides. On both sides."
2020-02-02 4:40,"Sadly, if this were to come out of Somalia, for example, perhaps fewer people would give a toss.

But the world has come to depend upon cheap Chinese trinkets and items made at slave labour wages there under a dictatorship. Cannot speak for America but here in Canada our dollar/loonie bin stores truly could not stay in business without these cheap Chinese import/landfill trinkets.

Perhaps demanding that China take prudent stances regarding seamless, quality health care for its people and open monitoring of same, before further trade with their partners returns, is in order.

Personally, our world needs a break. I know I do. One hears that what does not kill us makes us stronger, but for pity's sake, the world is already dealing with 'dumb as a dicky bird' Trump, climate change, cost of living, etc. Sometimes I feel I am coming to the end of my tether with these items of worry. Perhaps others feel the same."
2020-02-02 6:03,"Gee it sounds nearly as horrible as lying to the public about lead in the water causing irreversible brain damage. Or Love Canal, nuclear contamination, or a thousand other public health disasters the US government and big business lied about, abetted, and covered up. And we're supposed to be indignant at the Chinese? God help us when there is an outbreak of something in the US. Does anyone think the US government could build two 1000-patient hospitals in a week like the Chinese just did? Not a chance. Sure the Chinese regime is brutal, cruel, bureaucratic, etc. but it's in close competition with Washington."

2020-02-02 9:00,"It is not surprising that the authoritarian China hides and underlays the risks involved with many of the crises originating from there including the one related to the coronavirus, but what about the US where the entire Trump administration is engaged in shameless denial of science specially the climate change threat or rolling back various environmental regulations that jeopardise the quality even existence of the planetary life?

It was a bad time, people and government, avoiding a crisis."
2020-02-02 12:09,And we think it would have been different here. American Airline pilots had to sue their own company to get them to stop continuing to fly to China. Don’t I remember people going to court to avoid being quarantined during the Ebola crisis. In my town three people died within five miles of me last year from Hepatitis A and the state Health Department said wash your hands. They didn’t even investigate.
2020-02-02 12:21,"I can't help but think of the Soviet/Russian national government's bumbling and cover-ups after the big nuclear accident at Chernobyl.  

This situation in China as well as the one in the Soviet Union illustrate what happens when you have an unfettered ruler dominating the national government through his loyalists as well as dominating the state/province and city governments.

This is where we in the United States are headed folks.  Buckle your seat belts.  We, too, are in for a rough ride."
2020-02-02 3:04,"Perhaps the NYT has statistics on this, but for me it's just a generalization: it seems that the Chinese government has, increasingly under Xi's tenure, weaponized ""spreading rumors"" in the courts as a tool to punish anyone that threatens social stability (i.e. CCP legitimacy).

They'll invariably blame local officials in Wuhan (they already have), but the response would have been the same almost anywhere in the country. The rot doesn't just run deep - - it's state-mandated."
2020-02-02 4:01,"The disinformation campaign promoted by the Chinese Government is where WE are headed with the Dictatorial, Alternative Facts, Trump Administration. We can stop this madness in its tracks now if enough people demand that truth overtake propaganda.
Based on their history, It was expected that the Communist Chinese government was lying about the extent of the illness. The lives lost will be exponentially more because of this."
2020-02-02 8:01,"The U.S. has plenty of its own ""bad habits"" to deal with and can hardly point fingers at the failures of the Chinese government for this current (unfortunate yet inevitable) situation. It's precious that the media coverage is throwing stones. Look at your own back yard. the U.S.: a country that ignored the AIDS crisis, a country that doesn't have a health care system that serves all of its citizens, a country where women's health care is being attacked, where a bunch of know-nothings are ""anti-vac,"" and a country where the current leadership is hardly the champion of science, research and public health. 

I hate to write this, but here goes: concerns about the coronavirus are warranted, but the risk is being blown way out of proportion. It's a flu virus and there are 12,000 – 61,000 deaths annually in the U.S. alone from the seasonal flu. 26,000 die due to lack of health care coverage. And, let's not talk about gun deaths (oh, the current government doesn't even want to study that problem). Americans have their own set of bad habits they should worry about before throwing stones."
2020-02-02 11:22,"The Chinese government has a history of constantly lying, be it about appropriating (stealing) intellectual property, human rights violations or reporting of GDP growth.  This is just a further example of their trying to change the narrative (the truth), however, you cannot hide the dead and the virus does not just cling to poor peasants, it will also take down ""administrators""."

“It undermines the legitimacy of the government in messaging,” she added. “And public health is dependent on public trust.”

Here, in the US, the public has no trust in the government officials after reports of Trump changing NOAA hurricane forecasts and then, after getting it wrong, he forced the agency to make a statement that THEY were wrong. Sorry, I don’t trust this administration when it comes to public health."

2020-02-02 8:32,"Blind obedience and fear of government retaliation lead to this.

There is much to think about when the present US administration forbids agencies to talk about climate change, allows to dismiss scientific data on water and air to approve pipelines, sharpies the trajectory of a hurricane, and raises distrust on news by calling bearers of facts fake news.

The first goal of a corrupt system is to protect itself at all costs, no matter the consequences. This lead to this global outbreak that will possibly kill tens of thousands. Climate change is the US coronavirus. It is denied by a corrupt administration, despite all evidence and against all logic. How big will be toll this time?"
2020-02-02 10:37,"The global socio-economic context here is that the UN, influenced by global finance tied to large pharmaceutical interests, has installed a coordinated and institutionalized pandemic-phobia response structure, always eager to detect and disproportionately respond to each purported nucleus of a new lethal flu pandemic. 

The said global-finance interests also control major media networks, and are always happy to inflate pandemic phobia. Furthermore, the USA’s largest perceived threat in the present era is the rise and integration of Eurasia, economically driven by China. Therefore, coronavirus alarmism is also a geopolitical campaign opportunity to demean and isolate China; in effect, a weaponized hysteria that creates racist responses in many Western centers. Domestic anti-Chinese racism can be politically exploited in the USA to support aggressive policies against China, including protectionist policies limiting educational and economic exchanges.
However, I don’t think the Trump trade deals can be significantly affected by the coronavirus media frenzy: The so-called trade deals (coerced trade “balancing”) are a forcefully imposed life-line for the diminishing USA economy, which also eyes a horizon of loss of the USA dollar as the global currency."

2020-02-02 12:44,"It's great that we're dramatically curtailing flights between the U.S. and China and quarantining people citizens and legal residents who return from China.

However, there are other countries -- like the Philippines, Myanmar, Cambodia and Indonesia -- that aren't being as strict about this virus. Shouldn't we be applying the same travel restrictions and quarantine rules to them? If we wait until they are in full-on outbreak mode (as China did with its month of silence), it may be too late.

If you're curious about what's happening with these other countries, here's another article in the NYT: <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/02/world/asia/china-coronavirus-philippines-thailand.html"" target=""_blank"">https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/02/world/asia/china-coronavirus-philippines-thailand.html</a>"

It’s important to note, whether state-controlled or privatized medicine, the results are often the same.  Companies, state actors, and individuals are tempted to hide the truth, and they do.  There are legitimate reasons to fear the public.  

The cost of scapegoating, professional embarrassment, loss of public trust, personal and organizational liability, litigation, compensation for damages, and changes to existing practices impact people in very personal ways.  

When problems are discovered, it’s highly probable changes to existing policies and protocols (money, labor, equipment) will follow. The time it takes to deliver health care increases administratively and operationally.  These changes appear as “bad actors” fighting against the “cost-quality-speed” models of “good actors” who sell products and services improvements.  Who can be believed?

We need to rethink the means and constraints by which health care is provided.  It’s not a matter of choosing   between corporate or state providers."

Yes, it's fairly viral, but the death rate is low, and most of those dying are elderly, especially those with underlying illness. This is not like the Spanish flue of 1918, with young people dropping left and right. 

By running stories on this every day above the (digital) fold you're just panicking people for no good reason. The flu right now is a far greater danger to the average American than the Wuhan corona virus.

Scientists are working on a vaccine as quickly as they can. That's really all we need to know about it for now."
2020-02-02 9:51,"This is a question, not a comment:  Since the daily increase in the number of cases is pretty stable (2000 a week) while the total number of cases keeps going up (tripled over the last week) does that mean the percentage of people infected is dropping?"
2020-02-02 10:18,It is so much easier to focus on China's faults than to look at the problems in the United States.
2020-02-02 12:45,"I’d like to know more about our own response to this virus.  For instance, why did the State Department have one chartered plane to take Americans out of Wuhan province and not more?  How were those passengers chosen?  Why are they under quarantine while all the people who arrived here on commercial flights are not?"
2020-02-02 4:50,"Gee. This is so surprising, considering that China is one of the world's most open and representative democracies, with complete transparency and a reputation worldwide for probity and rectitude in all its governmental and business dealings. (Or at least that's how America, her businesses, and universities have acted)."
2020-02-02 7:44,"The WHO is now seen by many people around the world as a “spokesman” and “apologist” for the Chinese government given its recent decisions and statements. With more and more news surfacing on how the Chinese government is not as transparent and forthcoming as the WHO has tried to portrait over the past few weeks, many people now question whether the WHO is making decision based on science or politics, despite the organisation’s own proclamations and calls. The WHO says there is no objective and scientific reasons to limit travel and trade, and in fact opposes it, yet many countries around the world was shutting off their borders to China or Chinese citizens almost as soon as WHO declared the coronavirus as a global health emergency.

Can the WHO be trusted? Is it still an “authority” guided by only and solely by scientific expertise? What role can it still play if its recommendations are shunned by many countries or even mocked by people around the world. Or are people simply fuelled by panic of an unknown virus, and desperate for some visible and concrete measures form their government? Would this undermine the co-ordinated effort required to fight a potential pandemic by the international community? Perhaps the Times could have a take on that."
2020-02-02 10:44,"Interesting. But why should this be a surprise? Silencing doctors and denying a public health threat, nor even the acknowing the existence of a potentially deadly pathogen until it impossible to ignore is the standard operating procedure in a nation that does not have high regard for human life, except perhaps for members of the Communist party, nor promotes freedom of speech, freedom of the press, and freedom of thought. Wonder how the NBA will react to this, after all, it, and its chief spokesman, LeBron James, publicly defended China's recent Tinamen style actions in Hong Kong. Thank you."
2020-02-02 10:47,"As the Corona virus outbreak started in the US, the same would have happened and may be worse. Ask Puerto Rico how well the hurricane was handled. Perhaps the difference is that Trump would be on twitter insulting the virus and throwing paper towels at the CDC staff. 

Seems to me that they close the marked quickly, identify the virus quickly, and notify the WHO quickly. 

Spend some time to visit some US emergency rooms and you will realize how easy it is for an outbreak to quickly spread. 

As far as controlling the narrative, what do you think that Trump and the Republican Party are doing?"
2020-02-02 11:58,"Why are we surprise about this, the Chinese like any other countries but it's interest first. Why rules aren't put in place that once a new virus appears that it's report to the world and action to quarantine including all air travel out of a country. 

It's time to really re-think trade with China, China wants to trade with the world, yet NO country has a peace treaty, NO countries as any arms agreement, while they build the worlds largest army, they fail to follow any trade agreement they sign. China NO a country that wants to work with any other country instead it act like a bully if you don't agree with them. END ALL TRADE WITH THEM,  the world got along just fine without them."
2020-02-02 12:27,"This will always be the case with China, and their lack of world vision and responsibility, except being ascendant, as Trump orders his priorities, is just what I expect from a totalitarian regime.  This is why we must rid ourselves of the scourge of Trump, even if we are encumbered by 1/2 our lawmakers, all Republican who make this even more difficult...again one can look to China and their refusal to tolerate criticism when measuring them as a world power and also when we reflect on what we have wrought by electing Trump.  He will be in history the greatest American failure."
2020-02-02 6:37,"The CCP government has not yet learned from SARS but also pushes the SAR Hong Kong government not distribute surgical masks to Hong Kong people because millions of them have fought for freedom in the past months. It causes Hong Kongers are in high risky while the border connect to mainland still open. Thousands of mainland Chinese flee to the territory for medial care. For the past weeks, Hong Kong medical workers face extreme workload. At the same time, senior line up for masks during mid night. That are the reality in Hong Kong now. I am sorry that the overseas Hong Kongers have to mail masks to save their families and friends. It causes the inconvenience to the people in other countries. All thanks to this communist government with the second economic power."
2020-02-02 6:41,No one wants to take responsibility for anything. Even we Americans get lied to every day by our government. But I have been very impressed how the Chinese are handling it now. They are more prepared than we could ever be. I've been following it and the technology they are using to keep the people informed and how quickly their scientists and medical communities are trying to quell this is amazing. I hope the best for all people.

2020-02-02 12:03,The story tells us the Chinese gov't is controlled at the center even when unforeseen crises appear.  No response locally without the Center's ok.  Saving face is a particular feature of this.  Xi wants to promote the idea of firm control at the center with economic growth that benefits populace as the reward.  Its still unclear how harmful this virus will end up being.  Or how much this will damage the Communist party's prestige.

2020-02-02 4:11,"Could we trust our government, the Trump government, to handle a crisis like this differently? Given its penchant for secrecy. contempt for science and mistrust of nonpolitical federal workers, something like this could easily happen here."
2020-02-02 8:17,"The Chinese authoritarian police state is responsible for the spread of this epidemic, by trying to keep this terrible epidemic away from public knowledge.  Now their own people must be basically imprisoned in Wuhan to keep the epidemic from spreading.  If the knowledge the medical staff had was accepted, the epidemic could likely have been stopped sufficiently.  This is the difficulty of authoritarian governments--take note that truth does not run these governments."

This particular problem illustrates the Chinese governments tendency to view every internal problem as a “loss of face.”"
2020-02-02 4:01,"This is not at all surprising: Culturally (as well as politically), China values stability over results.  It is far better for an official to bury troublesome information, if (s)he can do so successfully--and in this case, was not--than to handle the trouble effectively.  

Rewards accrue not to those who nimbly sail a rough sea, but to the captain who says all is well (even when he knows darn well it is not).

All governments will try to shape the flow of information, but it is shameful when the criminal law is used to keep any but national security secrets."

The number of infected and of those who died is updated daily.  Press conference is given daily.  All the numbers reported by the western media are taken directly from those reported directly to the people in China.  The government is,in constant communication with the WHO.

While nurses and doctors from all provinces are working to help those infected and making sure that food and normal services,are continually being provided to those quarantined, you're here pointing fingers and exploiting the tragedy of the entire people of China to score political points?

Of the lowest of the low are those who exploit the tragedy of the vulnerable and innocent to aggrandize themselves.  When the nation's president does that, when its media supports that, when its people votes for that, then who can they blame when they themselves suffer a tragedy of their own making."

2020-02-02 12:46,"I can imagine similar things happening here, if the timing were right and the messaging unpopular - say right around the elections. This is an administration that denies climate change, is trying to kill health care and cut Medicaid - care for the fragile population most likely to be the human reservoir - and uses both propaganda and a defacto state news outlet to spread false information and lies.

Of course, we'd probably just be told it was pro-immigration forces that got us in this predicament.

And why can I see it happening? Remember AIDS? Our conservative government ignored it - who cared about the decimation of the gay community? - until it was shown to be a danger to the whole community. Then we finally leapt into action.

I can deplore China's slow reactions, but I can't feel like a superior American."
2020-02-02 12:51,"Imagine a similar scenario under the Trump Administration 4 years from now if he is re elected, as he continues to destroy expertise in our government and pushes “alternative facts”.

2020-02-02 5:51,"This is why Republican unblinking loyalty to Trump is so dangerous. Authoritarians operate on one principle, and one principle only: power at all costs.

They will literally sacrifice everything to keep their own power. They’ll even bribe millions of their own citizens in order to gain their acceptance of oppression of hundreds of millions of others.

Money and power will drive people to do anything. They’ll cover up viral infection epidemics. Lie about conditions following natural disasters, lie about who the state is keeping in prison and why, cover up conspiracies involving government contact awards etc.

If Trump told a Republican Senator to lie about something, let’s say it was arsenic in the air related to contaminated coal plant exhaust coming from a plant operated by one of Trump’s best campaign donors and golf buddies or something. What do you think that Senator would do? Do you trust that they would inform the public of the health risk?

In every authoritarian regime, every single one, the regime itself poses a far greater danger to the populace than any external threat. The upcoming election in 2020 is the last chance for Americans to save themselves from going further down that dark hole. And that’s the scary thing. We are nowhere near rock bottom. I’m a veteran of OIF & OEF. I’ve seen rock bottom with my own eyes. If Trump “wins” in 2020, it’ll put us on a rocket fired straight down."

On the bus ride from Kiev - they show us a video of events of the disaster.

Even Gorbachev was not informed in Moscow for a few days.

Their chief nuclear scientist assured Gorbachev - a rather minor incident

And folks in Chernobyl went about going about knowing an explosion had taken place.

Only after Scandinavian countries officially made inquiries - someone had the courage to tell Gorbachev

Even then, they first needed a committee to evaluate.

Once its results were known - folks in Chernobyl were given a few hours and could take only one suitcase on the way out.

It was done in such a hurry that even today - you see kids toys scattered around apartment, books left open.

So, this is hardly a surprise.

What the world needs to do is insist via WHO that China shut down all these types of markets - for good.

Until that is - they develop internationally approved guidelines to allow a market like this to function.

Given their wealth - Chinese are now the biggest group of travelers

We can expect to see the Chinese authorities starting to point fingers at one another, just like all politicians do in every government.

2020-02-02 12:14,"Before we rightly criticize the Chinese government, we should consider what the United State government is doing to contribute to climate change.  The Coronavirus is a public health emergency, but it will pass, probably killing hundreds or thousands.  In contrast, climate change is an existential threat for all of humanity.

Climate tops a now lengthy list -- groundwater depletion, drought; soil degradation; deforestation; desertification; ocean acidification; biodiversity loss, mass species extinction, ecosystem collapse; sea level rise, coastal subsidence, saltwater infiltration; mass displacement; aging, economic contraction; stranded assets, insolvency, debt crises.

In every instance, there has been a coordinated effort by a nexus of private and political interests to suppress warnings, discredit science and derail intervention.

It represents normalization of pathological and frankly genocidal behavior, driven by ignorance, greed and carelessness about consequences.

Its the result of a failed socio-technical complex of clueless analysts preparing useless decision models for incompetent executives -- self-serving mathematical games representing gambles on unrealistic statistical outcomes destined for loss.

Its a lack of moral hazard by decision-makers, easy transfer of risk to the powerless and vulnerable, and the assumption there will always be a public bailout with no real consequences.

There is a rapidly shrinking window of intervention to tackle this complex and interconnected set of emergencies, and we have already blown past numerous tipping points.

Bad government is bad government.  A universal observation."
2020-02-02 14:00,"I was struck by ""not using the words 'viral pneumonia.'""  That sounds a lot like telling state government workers not to use the words ""climate change.""  

And for Rand Paul: given what the whistleblowers in China went through, do you really think we are any different here?

We now have nature's blueprint for controlling the population: it won't be this virus.  And probably not the next one, either.  But there will be one, it will probably originate in either China or Africa, it could have been stopped, and it will be far more deadly. It's just a matter of time.  Sufficient will isn't there.  

After all, ""Politics is Always No 1."""
2020-02-02 14:09,This is biological warfare. Whether accidental or intentional the Chinese knew that there was a problem and covered it up. Rather than seek help from the World Health Organization the Chinese Government silenced concerned medical professionals and citizens alike. There has been no report of patients that have recovered which means the 14000+ infected will soon be casualties.
2020-02-02 14:21,"I am not surprised that so many comments here criticize China for everything from silencing from the top down, to the wild animal markets and overall animal treatment.

But how about we take a look at ourselves and learn from this? 

There is silencing in the US as well. Pompeo is example number one. Within the White House, Republican senators are watched closely and monitored for disloyalty to Trump. This breeds fear and mistakes. And Trump is dismantling environmental protections and science continually.

Then there is the health care system and those folks who have been influenced to be leery of vaccines on top of those who have no health care plan. How many unnecessary deaths will occur should something break out?

Last point, large scare factory farming. Yes. It's behind closed doors and few ever witness it, but it exists and it is a ticking time bomb. Poultry raised in close conditions and swine, any animal raised like this are petri dishes for mutating disease pathogens. Antibiotics are wearing thin and experts know this."
2020-02-02 14:26,Have there been a series of  algorithms developed that can provide a prediction model of the spread of this virus under various alternative scenarios that the public can see?  The tech industry should be useful for public health as well as social media and advertising.
2020-02-02 14:33,"My question is whether the west doesn't overreact to these ""foreign plagues."" Yes, we should take reasonable steps to mitigate the effects of this new virus, but many more people are dying of the ordinary flu in the US than have died in China from coronavirus. If we are serious about saving lives, how about putting more money into an effective flu vaccine for next year and try to increase the number of people vaccinated?"
2020-02-02 14:42,"I expect that China will end of paying a large price both economically and in terms of saving safe.

My wife and I had been talking of an Asian Cruise but we won't be thinking of that again anytime soon.   What will this do to Chinese tourism?  How will this influence people making decisions about doing international business with China?  How will this influence peoples decisions about buying foods and medicines from China, toys, and baby products."
2020-02-02 14:51,What I find particularly frightening is the silencing of doctors;  experts who have the duty to keep citizens  alive.

As, if anyone watched or listened to their briefing/Q&A a few days ago referencing the virus, the director general - Tedros Adhanom - could not have been more effusive in his praise for China, how they handled this outbreak and the steps they took/and are taking to thwart the spread. Also, he made it a point to remind the world not to castigate China and its leadership in this affair. One has to ask, ""what's going on here?"" This article here sites complete, detailed and investigated facts - and is almost identical to another I read 4-5 days ago. And yet WHO had their... shall I say ""talking points."" Hmm...

The open markets are fascinating and the spicy noodles and hotpot are delicious. A close Wuhan friend and colleague with whom I have been in daily communication on WeChat, told me this morning that there are 8 doctors including Dr Li (highlighted in the article suffering from CoronaVirus) now being hailed as heroes -translating to “the Glory 8”. He reports that markets have plenty of food—as result of preparations for the New Year— and the rate of new infections should drop as a result of the field hospital where he said medics “marched in” today, giving local people hope and building confidence in President Xi’s decisive actions. He also says: “ the management systems in Wuhan and HUBEI will be crashed down after the ending of this storm “ referring to the resulting recriminations that are occurring relative to the local authorities’ inaction. Clearly, it much more difficult to obscure the truth in today’s China. It will be interesting to see how WeChat, despite  censorship, affects the dialogue on government transparency and whether the central government will ban the sale of exotic meats."
2020-02-02 14:27,"This comes as a surprise? Anybody remember 3 mile island? Or as recently as now, the Afghan war? Governments lie all day about all sorts of stuff. The more authoritative and less democratic the government, the more they do it, just because it’s easier to get away with it. The army doesn’t keep us free. The Chinese and russsians have big, powerful armies. A free press keeps us free. The ability to dig into darkcorners and report on things without the government being able to shut them down is the only thing between us and wuhan."

Not so fast, folks. This isn't poison ivy. 
The proper authorities have been contacted and their plans for a few secluded days of binge watching The Sopranos won't fix this. 
Very angry people here posting threats against this family on FB. They will need official quarantine for their own protection. Hoping they will be moved to a military base quarantine hospital."

2020-02-02 4:28,But this is only half of the story. To report the other half you need to follow the money between local Wuhan officials and the owner of the seafood market. That will explain why they were so desperate to not let the outbreak news out so that it won’t lead to even more shocking tales of corruption and nepotism. They were just trying to save themselves the best they could. People who live around the seafood market had long complained of unsavory health practice and wild animals being openly traded and slaughtered on the spot to no avail.

Someone sneezes in this country and he or she is given a bagful of antibiotics.  We cavalierly dismiss natural medicines and homeopathic treatment as the stuff of mat hugging yoga enthusiasts when instead we should look to harness the natural remedies our planet provides for us.

2020-02-02 14:42,China's modus operandi of lying and underestimating the cases will teach them a good lesson from the virus. Nature is truth and they want to lie against nature. This will cost them dearly and hopefully teach them a lesson. Also this is an opportunity to set them back as an overly ambitious nation. Stopping flights is a good example. Their system of massive overcrowding combined with poor regulations and non transparency will be there demise. If not this virus another will be behind this one.

2020-02-02 14:22,Who are we to criticize authoritarianism in China when we have ongoing lies and coverups coming from the White House for the purpose of interfering with another country's leaders and trying to tamper with American elections? And that's just what we know right now. Who are we to condemn how another country handles an outbreak of disease when we have a president who tries to redraw hurricane maps and his followers who deny the reality of science?
2020-02-02 13:40,"Your criticism of China's handling of the coronavirus is unjustified!

The new virus was detected and confirmed in a matter of days, no small feat in the midst of an active flu season and a major holiday in which millions of people were travelling to celebrate with their families. 

The market that was found to be the likely origin of the disease was shut down and disinfected. Medical facilities were mobilized and augmented to treat infected persons.

Of course, care was taken to avoid widespread panic until the likely method of transmission was determined, avoidance measures could be recommended, and suspected carriers could be isolated.

Only the ""iron-fisted authoritarianism"" that has built a dozen or so megacities in a few decades could respond so decisively to avoid widespread panic and impose massive quarantines to contain the spread of the coronavirus.

Had the disease originated in Africa or India we would still be wondering why so many people are getting sick and dying from acute flu and pneumonia!"
2020-02-02 13:42,"In contrast to SARS,  the Wuhan coronavirus is transmitted before the patient shows symptoms, a successful strategy for a pathogen. Paraphrasing the play by H. Ibsen, Dr. Li became “The enemy of the state” for doing his job. This is another reason why authoritarian governments pose a threat for national security. Republicans in the Senate should have this in mind when they vote to acquit a president who has shown a predisposition to authoritarianism."
2020-02-02 13:59,"In this rabidly media-infested environment we have gone in the opposite direction, with each news station never losing an opportunity to keep us updated about the latest case of coronavirus in the U.S..  Given the fear being spread, even if inadvertently, I thought it was only a matter of time before Asians would be targeted in this country.  This morning I heard on NPR that that has come to pass."
2020-02-02 14:13,"The title of this article is much too kind, saying China's response to this growing pandemic is ""old habits.""

Please give us the epi curve on WHO is dying — I’m sure we’ll find that just as with the flu — it is the old and vulnerable who die. 

Let’s go away with the panic, and definitely stop with the mask hoarding- and focus on hand washing — and simple hygiene practices scientifically proven to prevent the spread of diseases way more contagious, e.g. cholera. 

Finally, this response seems way overblown and one can’t help to wonder if it has something to do with this administration trying to stick it to China. Let’s hope the NYT and other news outlets can stop reporting on the beervirus / coronavirus ad naseum and direct coverage to another deserving issue."
2020-02-02 14:37,"There is simply no substitute for a robust, proactive, and well financed approach to public health. This should include a priori legislation and policy coupled with ongoing public health initiatives, education, and yes, funding. SARS, MERS, and now the third news making Coronavirus will be far from the last such outbreaks. Why the Chinese authorities suppressed truth is maddening! As the esteemed expert on such matters, GEICO, puts it...""becuase that's what the Chinese do""."
2020-02-02 14:46,The Times in London has a graph comparing the speed of the spread of this versus SARS. The chart is actually scary showing the progress of this new virus almost like a rocket going up vs the SARS progress more like a plane taking off.
2020-02-02 13:37,"Can we start calling this disease by a unique name?  Turns out that various forms of Coronavirus have been circulating for years, and some folks are confused and saying that this isn’t a new disease.

All because the mayor criticized the current Administrator's environmental policy? Please.

You can bet your bottom dollar that if this gets worse, in some form or another, the reigning bodies will try and use it benefit their own selves. I can already hear it coming down the pipe, ""No medical funding for sanctuary cities. No medical aid for states represented by those who do not support a border wall. No medical aid, in any form or funding, to the states or districts represented by those who 'Hate America.'"""
2020-02-02 14:21,There was no mechanism to protect the people.  The only operation in place was designed to protect the government.
2020-02-02 14:22,"It is clear that China is not acting as an responsible global citizen.

Furthermore, concentrating global manufacturing in one country presents a major risk to human safety and well-being.

Consider the impact on the global supply chain if one country is forced to close its borders to contain a highly infectious and dangerous virus.

We must decentralise and distribute global manufacturing to minimise the risk of catastrophic events affecting one country.

This will also have the benefit of solving many of the economic problems in the western world associated with loss of highly skilled manufacturing jobs to China."
2020-02-02 14:47,"While I share your reservations with the Chinese system of government and their desire to control information in their society, I'm not convinced that any government in the world is fully prepared for a lethal virus that is able be transmitted before it shows symptoms and masquerades as a common cold. This virus is the result of population density combined with air travel.

Ask yourself this, would this have been handled better if this virus began with a US citizen without healthcare and lived in a city like New York? Would the US government be as quick to quarantine regions and lock down millions of the population (in an election year no less)?

The answer isn't to blame particular government, but to pool our resources to overcome this issue as a species, because if we don't it has to potential to wipe humanity off this planet."
2020-02-02 14:58,"While this is not a situation to panic about, it's been instructive watching how each stage has played out in the ways the CDC and WHO have modeled and prepared for. 

The ghost in the machine is the ""Great Flu"" epidemic of 1918. Ever since then, the CDC has worried about, warned, and predicted that should another similar flu come along, the game changer would be international travel. 

The number who died in 1918 has been continually revised upward, with some historians putting it as high as 100 million dead (initial numbers did not account for India and China where the losses were catastrophic). My guess is that it falls somewhere between the ""low"" figures of 20-50 million (still horrific) and that staggering number. Had their been plane travel then, some historians and scientists have speculated that the numbers of dead would have been akin to the Bubonic plague (in terms of total ratio annihilated).

There is a reason the WHO and CDC kick into high gear when events like this happen. We have to always be prepared for the worst and learn from each episode. Cutting off the pathway of infection through enforced quarantine in 1918 ultimately broke the chain of infection. Then, as now, it pays to suffer a few weeks or months of inconvenience if it safeguards millions. 

We can do our part by supporting these organizations, trusting them, and doing what we're asked to do, no matter how inconvenient. There's inconvenient and there's dead. Let's get our priorities straight."
2020-02-02 15:04,"In addition to reporting on global politics, it would be helpful to go local and provide practical information about measures the authorities are taking in New York City to prepare for more cases. New Yorkers know how day in and day out we are basically on top of each other, touching the same surfaces, breathing and sneezing on each other, eating at salad bars etc. I imagine most New Yorkers are not panicking by any means, but we do want to do what we can to avoid getting sick.

It would be great if, for example, there were hand sanitizer dispensers at subway stations to remind people to wash their hands. Could the authorities assure us that they are taking extra care to disinfect buses and subway cars? They are so dirty. Could they assure us of a free ambulance ride to an emergency room so we don't have to use public transportation or a taxi if we are feeling ill and have come in contact with people of high risk? Would the city be willing to actually deal with the fact that it can be spread when there are no symptoms, and shut things down until we figure this thing out? How about information on masks and prevention so that if we decide to wear or not wear a mask, it's a matter of common sense and not a ""statement"" of some kind? 

I know, I know. The flu still kills more people. For now. But it seems the authorities really don't understand how contagious this is, and how fatal. Often, official ""advice"" refuses to admit this reality, and so feels like gaslighting."
2020-02-02 15:24,"Beyond the politics, this and other articles from the Times missed the big picture about the virus crisis and why, unfortunately, such a health crisis is bound to repeat itself (and not just in China): the presence of live animals markets across China, which is traditionally popular. Even supermarkets like Auchan sell live fish in China, due to the importance of freshness for the Chinese consumer. Open-air markets in China or elsewhere are generally not super clean environments--it is why they are called markets! But when you add live animals to the equation, exotic or not, I think that you are raising the risk of contamination."
2020-02-02 15:52,"Nice comprehensive article. While on one hand China could be reprimanded for delay in announcing the pandemic, it has swiftly thereafter taken steps to prevent its spread. 
It needs to be thought if people and businesses affected due to such delayed action, should be allowed to make a monetary claim towards potential fatalities, mental trauma and the business loss. There has to be an international protocol governing such aspects to prevent regimes from acting in a irresponsible manner."
2020-02-02 15:54,"I have to wonder if, to some extent, the secrecy might have been to avoid widespread panic (in addition to political motivations?). Of course it shouldn't be kept from scientists and doctors and of course there might be ways of preventing panic and providing assurances that don't require absolute silence. Since we have never heard calm, reassuring words from our current leader, and since he admires this type of leadership, I might anticipate the same from him. Or else he will blab on twitter and frighten everyone while reminding us that he is the greatest at somethung. At the same time he will blame China not only for the virus but for the downturn in his sacred stock market, which takes precedence over all else."
2020-02-02 16:03,"I think that this report gives the impression that Beijing was doing the cover up. Infact, it was the local Wuhan authorities that first initiated the cover up. The Central Government has since sent their people to take control of the situation and ensure that there is full information flow.
Also note that Beijing has fired one of the local health authority for his inability to answer basic questions."
2020-02-02 16:14,"This morning’s print addition had an interesting graphic showing a 6-foot cone of contagion around an infected person.  What caught my eye, though, was a sentence in the graphic’s subtitles:  The virus lifespan on surfaces is unknown. I guess we will find that out when the first wave of product from infected factory workers hits our shores.  Especially with smart phones we hold directly to our faces."
2020-02-02 16:22,"This is Exhibit A for why:
We need a liberal democracy with a free press.
We need free speech protected.

We need to ensure that our country doesn’t became an autocracy afraid of truth snd science. 
We need to support people and governments in other countries who strive for what we need, because they need those thing too. 

We are all connected. The question is what we make of those connections."

viral pneumonia. those two words should frighten us all but no where do I see this clearly stated."
2020-02-02 15:35,"While I agree the Chinese government has likely been under-reporting the impact on their citizens, and they could've been more transparent, I would caution everyone against expecting ideal transparency and reaction by our own government officials.

I just watched Mayor DeBlasio's press conference, and he and his officials either mistakenly or deliberately misrepresented several aspects of the virus. They claim that the virus cannot be spread by asymptomatic carriers, that it can only be spread by intimate contact, and that the virus cannot contaminate inanimate objects. WRONG WRONG WRONG on all 3 accounts, as per information trickling out from news reports in Asia.

I would suggest doing your own research and preparing for a potential outbreak scenario in and around the 5 boroughs. Based on how the Mayor and his administration appear to be reacting, they are not attributing nearly enough caution and hazard to the situation. Be safe!"

Typical of an authoritarian government that is not responsive to its citizens.   Think about Trump's lies like altering the actual path of a hurricane on a map or declaring that the traumatic brain injuries experienced in the Iraq bombs were merely ""headaches"".  Remember the alterations to the EPA website soon after Trump took office. 
 Can Trump and his lying government be trusted to reveal the truth about coronavirus in the USA?  Will his government departments be honest?  Acquittal from the impeachment indictment only emboldens Trump's confidence in lying.  The only remaining difference between dictatorships and the current US government is the Free Press."

Meanwhile  the 195 citizens flown in from wuhan are under mandatory quarantine. The level of uncoordinated response to this virus has been disturbing."

Reports of people dropping dead (I assume heart failure) has been circulating for a few weeks now, something Beijing desperately wants covered up. This crisis could have been prevented but as we know the CCP just couldn’t help itself and fell back on old habits. Even with the crisis unfolding they still insist on trying to use it to their advantage, now they’re using the makeshift hospitals as a propaganda piece. ""Mighty China has built a 1000 bed hospital in 10 days, behold the power of the Party"" - the 1000 bed hospital is already full. At this point it’s time for tent cities and probably even utilizing sporting venues. Who needs Hollywood when we have this reality brought to us by the CCP?

2020-02-02 15:46,"Very valuable article. 
Compare to the docudrama ""Chernobyl.""
Organizations such as bureaucracies or Enron or Big Banks  get easily politicized and this seriously disturbs their abilities to function properly. There is a meaty literature on this. Whether communist or capitalist the internal dynamics muck up proper functioning. 
This article is great because it goes beyond information about the virus and its handling, which is very valuable, and provides a good example of the damage to the public good caused by politics in the channels through which information needs to flow and work needs to get done. 

There is the tendency to define ""corruption"" too narrowly to mean ""being on the take."" There are other forms of corruption as well. Corrupt in science can merely mean ""debased."" 

Speaking of this virus, it is worth remembering how AIDS went out of control in large part because of politics. Health officials were not given the support necessary in the early days when the disease might have been nipped in the bud. Their profession was not allowed to function properly by the higher powers in Washington. 

I hope this article brings to mind in the readers the nature of the general sorts of forces at work.

This article makes clear that a more open and truthful approach---not worried about political r economic implications--would have saved many lives and avoided a crisis, a crisis that is becoming harder and harder to handle.  
This should be a lesson for our present Administration vis-a-vis climate change.  Ignoring the data for political or economic considerations , throwing away the consensus of the scientific community and making light of our own weather experiences---will only make it harder and harder to solve the problems climate will bring as it worsens.  Unfortunately, we have an administration where truth is avoided, playing second fiddle to economics and politics."

I had to throw the computer away since it was so bad even are resetting everything.

Trump maybe pushing our government towards that style of monitoring but so far we are not even close to what life is like in mainland China.

They do this without allowing their own citizens to take the same critical approach to their government’s shortcomings. Hiding the truth to save face is an important component of keeping the Chinese population in subjugation to the Communist Party. Its initial handling of the coronavirus outbreak is just another example of China’s tendency to do this.  Clearly American democracy has its problems: a liar, bully, dictator, science-basher, and abuser of women as president (who wasn’t even elected by the majority of Americans). A sycophantic and cowardly Republican Party that condones this behavior to ensure reelection; a  history of slavery and racial prejudice; an obsession with guns and gun violence. But the difference between China and the U.S. (for all you China propagandists out there) is that Americans can publicly point out the shortcomings of the American government (as I am doing right now) while your average person in China is scared to death to publicly insult China’s president Xi Jinping or the Communist Party.

They said the government came and said it was nothing at first, then left. Then it got bigger and government took it more seriously. It's actually been happening since early December or even earlier.

In China and Chinese people I've noticed no one wants to be the person who delivers bad news. So they put it off and pretend it's not there. Then this happens.

He said that the system there is broken with too few doctors to care for too many patients. The government is only interested in preserving its own power and not in supporting those serving the patients.

There is no cure for this virus whether in China or here. The pandemic is just beginning. Many people will die before it is over.

Governments put their own survival over the needs of their people. Cambodia's ruler just announced that he doesn't want to threaten the economy by restricting tourists and business people from China. He would rather they die than that he and his cronies lose money.

Medical experts incorrectly assume, based on the limited information, the disease is not human transmissible. Everything looks confined to one market. However, that mistake is easy because the disease has a two week gestation period. Add to that late diagnosis. You could easily go a month before realizing what is really going on. Is it any surprise public officials weren't rushing to intervene when even doctors were getting things wrong?

I don't think this is China's fault. Politicians spin things positively when convenient. That's what they do. Airports were shutting down services of their own volition. Trump was still telling everyone things are hunky dory. Meanwhile, Mexicans are still murders and rapists. Expanding the Muslim ban is somehow beneficial to public health.

It is considered private. In the USA more so to the patient and patient's family since the leakage of any health crisis can sudden have the patient abandoned by their insurance company and fired. 

There has never been any pandemic that has not began with multiple people dying first. At no time ever, has one patient with some unknown disease been the RED FLAG of the start of the contagion until after the pandemic is over and is history. Only hindsight is 20/20. 

If you don't want any more pandemics then be immunized. Buy multiple of gloves and wear them all of the time, only taking them off to launder them. Always remove your shoes at the entry of the house and have a specific place to set them. Before the discovery of antibiotics this was the way people lived because it could save their own lives. There is a reason most churches want babies christian asap, but once a member always a member and even a century ago the first year of life was a child's most dangerous year.

When mad cow disease showed up in one cow here in Alberta and made international headlines,  the then conservative premier, Ralph Klein,  suggested the best course of action should have been, as in days of yore, ""shoot, shovel, and shut up"". Instead those involved decided to man up, admit the truth of that case and others that followed. We lost billions in the ensuing global bans of our beef. 

Meanwhile our neighbors to the south, vehemently and self righteously denied they had a similar problem. The beef lobby in the States ensured that not only would the profits from the industry continue, they would skyrocket because the vaunted Alberta beef was off the market. 

But here's where it all changed. Alberta, through painstaking diligence has a clean slate. Every single calf that is born is tagged, its genetic background recorded. Tests are open and transparent. Our beef is again among the best in the world. 

I am sure the Americans are compliant now, but back in the day, they quietly followed the Ralph Klein SSS protocol and never did admit anything.

Trump and his minions in congress have allowed America to become akin to communist countries where they control the message (their followers have been brainwashed that any news not coming from state news/fox is 'fake'), and hide/gloss over any news events that cast the administration in a bad light.

In New York alone there are markets similar to those in Wuhan that the city is well aware of that are filthy and import fish and meats from China and the Philippines. The city does not do anything to monitor these markets.  They issue summons.  They are paid, and business as usual resumes.  They hose down the streets into our sewers.  The rat problem is horrendous, and again, the city does not do anything.   

We are always warned of the farming habits from these countries.  Many of us will not buy food that has been farmed from those countries, but many do.  They are broadcast on social media.  Fake news?  Who knows?  But who needs to take the chance.  Many have, and it could be like playing Russian Roulette.

The government, whether it be federal, state or city is obliged to step in, tell its denizens what is going on, be transparent, make sure that we are safe from the beginning by cleaning up the markets to start, importing only safe food, or close down those markets that won’t comply.

""In 2017 and 2018, the philanthropist billionaire Bill Gates met repeatedly with Bolton and his predecessor, H.R. McMaster, warning that ongoing cuts to the global health disease infrastructure would render the United States vulnerable to, as he put it, the “significant probability of a large and lethal modern-day pandemic occurring in our lifetimes.” 

""And an independent, bipartisan panel formed by the Center for Strategic and International Studies concluded that lack of preparedness was so acute in the Trump administration that the “United States must either pay now and gain protection and security or wait for the next epidemic and pay a much greater price in human and economic costs.”"

For many, it will be the economic effects that will produce the worst horrors as recession and even depression loom large.

They are truly in that proverbial position between a rock and a hard place. When they give us warnings, protocols and recommendations they are hounded for ""daring"" to ""inconvenience us"" or accused of being hysterics. Just go back and read posts during the SARS outbreak and the Ebola one. 

You would think that we might be grateful that we were spared worse outcomes and spared them expressly because these organizations and doctors and nurses on the ground took control of the situation, many of them giving their own lives. Instead, I read hundreds of posts about ""the deep state,"" the ""outrage"" of having to be checked for symptoms at airports, the ""outrageous costs"" of having workers stay home for three days, etc. And then the smug chortling, ""We told you it was no big deal!"" It seems lost on these geniuses that it was no big deal...because of the precautions taken. And it was a big deal to those who died.

You can bet your house that those who grouse about being inconvenienced or claiming it was a hoax (thanks, Alex Jones) would be the ones screaming bloody murder if the CDC or WHO failed to take appropriate action.

I am so very grateful for the men and women who devote their lives to preventing catastrophes. They are heroes."

Ten percent to a third who got it died. 

As summer came on, deaths grew from a dozen a week to two then three score a week by the first week in June, then basically doubled every week, some weeks even tripling, until by mid July until deaths peaked and 5,000 /week for several weeks running, until it receded."

There is no denying that the eradication of this virus ought to be the top priority of governments around the world; this is no longer an internal issue for China. 

At some point, attention to the definition of sovereignty must be drawn. Sovereign states, like China, have the right to conduct their internal affairs.

Chinese censors have worked diligently to remove any coverage of the outbreak, and police have harassed people for spreading ""rumuors"" about the disease.

When a ship is holed below the waterline - by a rock or a weapon - sailors rush to close water-tight doors, to contain the flooding. That prompt action keeps the ship afloat until it can be fixed. 

When ebola erupted in West Africa in 2014, the first response should have been so end all flights from the region and to limit inbound flights to those with relief supplies. 

Such a flight ban would have affected only the few wealthy in Sierra Leone, Guinea, and Liberia. An air traveler from Liberia - sick with ebola - arrived in Lagos (Nigeria) and collapsed in the airport. Nigerian authorities, on guard, hospitalized him (he soon died) and tracked-down all, who had had contact with him. That rapid response kept ebola from spreading in Nigeria.

The lesson: quarantines - air travel shut-downs - must be imposed at soon as possible, when a new, lethal, and easily transmissible disease emerges."
2020-02-02 13:34,"The west learned from its mistake when its secrecy during WW1 helped the 1918 flu pandemic spread globally killing 1% of the world's population. Spain was not in WW1 so it did not have secrecy so news reports of the illness first came out of Spain. It was termed the Spanish flu for this reason, when it really started in the middle of the US at an army barracks.

The CCP has not learned from history because it does not allow real history to be even be taught to its people. The hardworking Chinese people have been brainwashed and news is censored from them. This is one of the reasons why all the nasty sicknesses come out of China."

Even today she said on NY 1 TV that people should go out and act normally. Even Bill DeBlasio said people should take flu precautions. 

Why can this bumbling so called health commissioner not tell people to wash their hands as soon as they get home, to avoid touching objects and not touch their eyes nose and mouth?  What is WRONG with her?  And those recently returned from China should self quarantine for 2 weeks at home."

    China's leaders may declare victory against the outbreak of this deadly coronavirus and they will undoubtedly credit the Communist Party of China's leadership but the truth is just the opposite, the party is again responsible.
   Even the Wuhan's Community Party chief, Ma Guogang told the state broadcaster CCTV that the city should have taken measures sooner to contain the virus.
   The first case of coronavirus was reported on Dec. 8, the Wuhan municipal health commission didn’t issue an official notice until several weeks later.. And, since then, Wuhan officials have downplayed the seriousness of the disease and deliberately sought to suppress news coverage.

I suggest you use100% cotton fabric and make several masks for each person so everyone can have a fresh mask each day. I also suggest you wash the masks in hot water, detergent and bleach after every use so they're clean and germ-free. 

Youtube has several free videos that show you how to construct your surgical mask step by step.  The videotape below is the one I watched, and it was simple and clear.  But there are other good videos on youtube, too. The only thing I would add is that you should also insert a very thin wire into the top strip and sandwich it in with a zig-zag stitch so you can bend the top of the mask to make it fit securely around your nose. Stay well and happy sewing!

2020-02-01 21:34,"Authoritarian governments maintain their rule by exercising control and refusing, or punishing, all feedback. At their heart is distrust of the people and their needs, which are considered transitory, affected by emotion, and unimportant to the grand movement of the government, which is often directly over the feelings of the people to get to a desired state. The result is that when a catastrophic illness strikes, the immediate reaction of even low-level officials is to disbelieve those affected, even doctors, out of a general distrust of the uncontrolled people. Control will be maintained and illness denied until such time as the outbreak infects a sizable portion of workers and progress toward national goals is delayed. Only then will the central government respond, without knowledge of the disease, its true extent, its etiology, and most importantly its incubation period. Without this knowledge all the central government can do is restrict movement and begin to gather basic data on where the cases are appearing. In China's case, the recent New Year movement of people makes this problematical at best, and potentially catastrophic. If the entire country has been seeded with seemingly-well people already carrying and spreading the coronavirus, they are weeks away from the worst effects, and looking at a pronounced and debilitating health crisis. We are looking at only the beginning of a paralyzing outbreak."

The only questions at this juncture are, will it be short-lived like sars, and peter out, or will it mutate into something more deadly and rampage through society at large.

If it's the latter, will a real vaccine be developed in time, and once ready can it be deployed planet-wide, if not inhaled or injected, perhaps airborne deployment.

The next two weeks will tell us much.

I have to consider we are not hearing the full facts, at this juncture, likely due to governments trying to contain economic fallout, absolutely foolish, because if we do not get busy and mount defensive / offensive measures, we could be looking at catastrophic consequences.

Even if we overreact, our efforts will be much needed practice for the next epidemic; believe me with what we have done through the weakening of human immunity because of widespread use of antibiotics in the food supply, and the out-of-control warming of the planet, we have created one massive Petri dish called Earth.

The ugly side of this bug is that is that the number of reported infected people can go from 50 to thousands in less than a week.

2020-01-31 13:57,Thanks for the excellent details. I hope people understand the graph is logarithmic one!
2020-01-31 14:30,"Somewhere out there a pandemic is waiting that could be just as devastating as the influenza epidemic of 1918-19 that killed between 20 and 40 million people worldwide, more deaths than World War I and World War II combined.

That epidemic sickened approximately 25 percent of the U.S. population and caused the average life expectancy in America to drop by 12 years.

In the excellent new Netflix documentary series Pandemic, a team of researchers are working toward a vaccine that would be effective against all types of flu and having considerable success. However, they need $2 million to continue to the next phase, and there is no guarantee they will get the crucial funding. The tension is palpable as they wait to hear from a private foundation.

Two million dollars! In a country that spends $750 billion dollars a year to finance some 800 military installations  around the world to extend American power and ""interests,"" i.e. corporate interests!

Two million dollars in a country that recently gave almost a TRILLION dollars in tax cuts to the wealthiest one per cent of the citizenry!

The military-industrial complex and the current control of the American government by the rich and powerful are going to kill us -- perhaps literally this time."
2020-01-31 14:31,When will Canada take more aggressive steps in stopping the flow of potential cases? Lots of concern with travelling anywhere at the moment.
2020-01-31 14:41,"At least with the internet and cellphones, the students who can't attend school/college might still be able to coordinate with their teachers to finish out the edu.year.   Rhetorical question: In America, how would we keep the education system moving forward in the event of a mass quarantine situation?

Moreover, even though the mortality rate seems to be lower than SARS, the lost productivity, in local economies and ultimately, in G.D.P happening right now, may do a lot more damage in the upcoming weeks and months than companies/economies have calculated to deal with in their annual forecasts."
2020-01-31 15:27,"The place to stop a pandemic is at the source. Most of the major epidemics of the last 20 years have been newly mutated viruses that jumped between species in southern China due to the vast number of very small farms that place pigs, ducks, chickens, wild bats and humans in close proximity. The solution is to modernize the one sector of the Chinese economy that has been skipped by industrialization, agriculture. Modern sanitation practices and separation of species are needed. Unfortunately this will disrupt the lives of millions of small farmers."
2020-01-31 15:31,"As concern about contagion of the coronavirus spreads, Americans should remember that 8000 people in this country have already died from the flu this season.We need to be vigilant and do all the smart things to avoid the perils of the flu this year because it is particularly dangerous.There is a double dose of worry."
2020-01-31 15:00,"My guess is that closing borders may be too late. 

Panic can cause more deaths from other causes than the disease itself, not to mention the social and economic impact, no?"
2020-01-31 13:57,"How long ago did UK know?

How many days for a corona virus test kit to show positive?

Excerpt from the Guardian: In recent days, ambulance workers and paramedics have been seen in protective suits in a number of places. A man was reportedly removed from a budget hotel in York by health workers in full protective suits and taken to a hospital isolation unit. The man, who was a guest at the Staycity hotel in the centre of York, was taken to hospital, together with family members, by medics.

I would want to trust my government, but how?!"
2020-01-31 15:48,"There are over 9800 confirmed cases of the new coronavirus infection in China and 213 death, Most of the death 95% are occurred in Wuhan epicenter. Within one month, every province or region in China have reported their cases . This has demonstrated the highly infectious or contagious of this new virus. From the available reported data, it appears that the mortality rate for this new coronavirus is around 2% which is less than SARS 9-10% and MERS 35%.

There are 100 cases reported outside China involved  20 countries with no death. We would expect 1-2 death if the same mortality rate apply to this outside population. Many of the cases are from China and then passed on second or third persons which represent second or could be third wave of infection. If this trend continues to hold truth with minimal or no  death, could the new coronavirus mutate and become  less virulent or may become another "" Cold "" coronavirus? 

Let's hope and be vigilant. It is not too late to get your influenza vaccine. So far, more than 8,000 people have succumbed to influenza virus during this season in US according to CDC."
2020-01-31 15:30,"The use of a log scale for the graph makes it visually more appealing, but how many readers, even of the NY Times understand what the scale means? At first glance it looks as if the death rate for coronavirus is about 50%, which it clearly isn’t. 

The last thing needed for a serious world-wide health problem is misleading information that leads to panic rather than clear thinking."
2020-01-31 15:57,"This coronavirus seems to be a natural Darwinian evolutionary effect.  No one wants to hear this or conceive such a thing, but akin to Climate Change, perhaps the planet is telling us something.  Perhaps it's telling us our global population is exceeding the limits of the resources available to maintain healthy life.  
As a result of us reaching beyond what was permitted (by the planet) for nourishment and energy, we have unleashed poisons and pathogens that exist for a singular purpose.  To cull the population of living organisms that has grown beyond the earth's ability to provide for them. Effectively, to return earth to a level of sustainability.  
Yes, it's a morbid thought, but I would argue it is not necessarily untrue.  Is it?  After all NO one knows what is earth's FULL CAPACITY (ala an economics theorem)... but it does have a limit, and will fight back when it has to."
2020-01-31 16:06,"Not the first time it’s been suggested a dangerous viral infection originated in a Chinese food market where live animals, some wild, are kept in close proximity to each other and to people.  

China hasn’t shied away from making strict rules that override traditional cultural practices.  What are the chances their authoritarian government will turn out to be an advantage by forbidding these live animal markets as a threat to public health and safety?

PS, let’s also discourage anybody, anywhere, from capturing bats and eating them!  Bats are much more valuable to the rest of us in keeping the insect population in check and they are a natural concentrator of many viruses such as the coronavirus group."
2020-01-31 16:12,I am curious why countries are still accepting flights from China without a mandatory fourteen-day quarantine. This seems pragmatic but I'm not an ID specialist. Does anyone know?

This companion NYT article is I think quite good and worth reading."
2020-01-31 14:52,"Many countries import from China. I don’t know if Wuhan is a manufacturing center of goods that travel all over the world. How long does this virus live on surfaces? Is merchandise from China going to be blocked because it can transmit this virus to any part of the world that excepts their cargo ships?  If and that’s a big if, this happens the world’s Economies will be impacted by this. These diseases that originate in China must be eradicated even if they do kill less than the flu. At least we have a system in place for the flu virus. It seems like every 10 years or so a new virus comes out of China. China should be responsible for making sure these mutating viruses don’t happen again.  They have the financial resources to do this. I am immune deficient,  no longer having my spleen and also having an autoimmune disease that lowers my immunity so I am more cautious than the average person when it comes to illnesses. I look at merchandise that I consider buying and if I see it is made in China I hesitate because it doesn’t say where in China it was made and no one has told ud how long this virus lives. If it can survive on surfaces and is in a container could it jump to a different container on the same ship?  I keep thinking of the movie Contagion and pray that reality doesn’t follow fiction. I"
2020-01-31 16:34,I think it is inhumane to bar visitors from a country because of potential diseases.  This kind of restriction is overbroad and harmful to the world.
2020-01-31 14:48,"This is a real tragedy for the Chinese. Not only are their families at risk of sickness and death but also their livelihoods and their educations are in danger. We should be doing all we can to help, not just what protects ourselves. Offering help is what a great power would do, but we know what we are now-- a country whose leadership wants and plans to benefit from the misery of others. A disgrace!"
2020-01-31 15:23,What happens after 14 days? All is well?
2020-01-31 16:35,China is arranging to have Wuhan citizens in foreign countries to return home to the epicenter of the coronavirus.  Does that make sense?
2020-01-31 16:45,"This is an opportunity for the U.S. to help with badly needed medical supplies and treat China with some kindness.  I’d we don’t work to get along, our relationship with this growing superpower will deteriorate further, to our detriment."
2020-01-31 16:58,"It's far too late to ban visitors from traveling, especially Chinese visitors. The virus is global. The only thing to do now is for global powers to coordinate collective action to combat it."
2020-01-31 16:46,"Wei suspects he became infected while treating a patient on Jan. 19, when Chinese authorities were insisting the disease, which is suspected to have started in a live animal market, was not transmissible between humans. Wei was wearing only a disposable surgical mask and no goggles when the patient coughed in his face.

“As long as you’re not diagnosed, you must go to work,” said Wei. He and other doctors spend their nights at the hospital because of transportation shutdowns. “We know that we are causing risk of contagion to the patients. But if you don’t work, then what? There’s no one to replace you. Your colleagues must bear more, and they’re also infected.”

The official tally of infection cases was “definitely not reliable,” Wei said. He noted: Too many patients are not being counted. There are not enough test kits. Not enough doctors. Not enough hospital beds. Not enough medicine. Not enough masks. Not enough cars to take patients to the hospital.

“There are a lot of patients and they are anxious,” said Wei, who fashioned his own goggles out of plastic sheets. “Many are calling here and you can hear them shouting on the phone, ‘Save me, save me,’ and they are crying, and there’s nothing we can do.”"
2020-01-31 16:42,"I don't know what the Chinese official in Wuhan is feeling guilty for? As is often said no use crying over spilled milk. Deal with the spilled milk and put all the available means to get rid of the Wuhan Corona Virus (WCV). The travel advisory telling Americans not to travel to China is justified until such time China can declare itself free of WCV. At the same time China should be humbled enough to take all the expert help possible from anywhere in the world for executing a strategically thought multi pronged approach with minimal political adulteration to eradicate WHC from China. 

As a Virologist honored with an appointment of Adjunct Professor of Traditional Chinese Medicine at Henan U, Zhengzhou, China precisely to develop collaborations to find Chinese solutions for a serious Chinese problem, I stand ready to join hands with our Chinese people and the largest inhabitants to share our planet in fighting the vicious onslaught by an electron microscopic WCV. I hope many of US who think that they can be of help due to having skills that could be of help are ready to take a calculated risk after doing a due diligence of risk benefit analysis join hands to stop the onslaught of the WCV before it invades our shores in devastating numbers. 

We have sent our troops overseas in harms way through out this century to keep dangerous terrorist from repeating 911 on our shores. Why not we not send a cavalry of our hidden talents trained to deal with deadly public health threats?"
2020-01-31 17:13,"It is obviously time for the world, the UN and world governments to rethink our relationship to animals.  As much as I love the occasional burger or a piece of salmon, I have reduced my intake of animal proteins to about twice a month, and never felt better. I am 62, and have been vegan, macrobiotic, vegetarian and omnivore on and off since the early 1980s, depending on my travel schedules and whims. 

There are also plenty of markets in South America where bats, and snakes and other non domesticated and farmed animals are consumed, but we have never experienced such outbreaks from that region. I wonder why."
2020-01-31 17:23,"I'm not surprised that the virus can be ""handed off"" before the first victim gets symptoms.  Nor should anyone who has dealt with childhood diseases - measles, chickenpox, mumps, roseola are all ""contagious"" prior to symptoms.  That's part of why they are so virulent.  I got chicken pox when I was 31, in February, and I have no idea where it came from.  My child didn't get it for another year (and it came in spring, as it usually does)."
2020-01-31 17:03,"Tiny bit of good news: the first patient diagnosed and hospitalized in Toronto, a gentleman in his ‘50’s, has been discharged from hospital."
2020-01-31 18:41,"If the world reacted the way it does about this virus as it would climate change, think about the action that could happen.

While this virus is a threat, it won’t be as lethal as the diseases and health issues that will result from climate change. 

I wonder how long it will take the WHO to designate climate change as a global health emergency."
2020-01-31 18:44,"I feel like this whole situation with the Corona virus might be overblown. It's not that I do not feel for those who lost someone to the virus, but it's almost like every year a new ""plague moment"" appears such as the Zika virus or Ebola. 

Every time they appear everyone--the media, government, and people in general--act like it's the end of the world or something and usually a month or so later it ends up being forgotten about. Now it could very well end up becoming worse than we expect, but isn't that how it is with all these new viruses every year? 

All I am saying is I think we should just let nature take its course, and if the virus ends up becoming much worse than imagined then go ahead and take whatever drastic measures are necessary."
2020-01-31 18:46,No reason I suppose to ask what would happen if the influenza and coronavirus stuck the same person.  A child or elderly person.  Someone with a compromised immune system.  If this isn’t a wake up call to leave wild and other animals alone and practice better hygiene I don’t know what is.
2020-01-31 16:17,"As much as Mr. Guoqiang may be remorseful, the prevention of a pandemic disaster cannot be left to individual heroics. China and the rest of the world must make sure the system of prevention, sureilance and control is in place and is working. In that regard, Wuhan virus may be a perfect one for the exercise: it is not too lethal, but highly contagious. If we fail to stop this one, we sure as heck won't stop the next Spanish Flu. We should fix whatever is not working and get ready for the Big One."
2020-01-31 12:33,"German experience with this Corona virus shows that 4 out of 5 infected show NO symptoms AT ALL. So the good news is the virus is less damaging the bad news is, it is more contagious. Overall, its risk seems to be comparable to seasonal flu. German experience supports the Chinese observations. You can't contain an outbreak when 80% of the infected persons show no symptons while being contagious. We should stop bashing Chinese authorities."
2020-01-31 16:45,"In 1976, as a 19-year old college student, I took a gap year and found myself teaching English in a school in Rumbek, South Sudan.
Shortly after my arrival, a virulent outbreak of ebola - first in Zaire, and immediately thereafter in South Sudan - infected several hundred people. In the Sudan, quarantine was pretty quickly imposed. Intra-country travel was immediately curtailed and all borders were closed. Confronted by a virus with a 50-90% mortality rate, WHO's response was quick and courageous, and Sudan complied.
For me, at 19, cut off from the developed world for several worrisome months (particularly for my parents!), this provided an object lesson in efficiency and competence while in the hottest of hot zones.
Of course, there was no social media then to foster ignorance and inflame speculation - cautious rationality in the face of real chaos and potential danger was the order of the day."
2020-01-31 14:47,"Not going differently here in Rome. On Jan 23rd two whole flights directly from Wuhan landed in FCO airport, just screening people for fever. 
I totally support the no drama approach while being careful with the basics. But what I personally find dramatic and outrageous is the fact that many governments, mine included, state continuously that people with symptoms are treated immediately and set in quarantine, depicting a scenario completely under control. Forgetting that people with no symptoms could still be infective. No plotting wanted but...how much of this happens because of economic and politic interest? So sad."
2020-01-31 17:22,"Wow, those numbers really jump up!
Are we being fed bad information?"
2020-01-31 17:42,First confirmed case in Sweden. The person recently travelled to Wuhan.
2020-01-31 18:17,Dodged a bullet with my six hour layover in Beijing last month though the persistent coughing of a few people on the flight certainly disturbed me. Now I know why so many Chinese wear masks apparently not just due to pollution
2020-01-31 18:31,"Russia (China’s BFF) closes border with China, and Hua Chunying - Chinese Spokesperson- doesnt say a peep. American warns its own cotizens not to travel (rightly so), but does not quarantine all travellers arriving from China (whether Chinese or US citizens and residents regardless of ethnicity- color blind criterion) into the US- Chinese spokesperson accuses America of being unfriendly. In a time like this, best not to point fingers or stir the pot. Some self reflection and consideration of others’ need for caution might be more respectful and in line with the confuscious value of being humble. 

As it is, US is allowing whole plane fuls of travellers arriving from mega cities in China into LAX some of which are arriving for the LA Art Show, at a major convention center, mingling without quarantine period with tens of thousands of Angelenos.

What do you think you would do if you were in our shoes? Too friendly, in my view."
2020-01-31 18:51,"Yearly flu stats: In U.S.: ""While the impact of flu varies, it places a substantial burden on the health of people in the United States each year. CDC estimates that influenza has resulted in between 9 million – 45 million illnesses, between 140,000 – 810,000 hospitalizations and between 12,000 – 61,000 deaths annually since 2010.""
And folks don't want to take the flu shot."
2020-01-31 18:00,"I wonder if quarantine at this stage is the answer for the Chinese cities. Imagine a rapidly spreading virus, now being given a menu or small apartments, common vent systems and infected and non infected folks all stressed out and holed up in close proximity. The repercussions are awful. Folks are all going to be exposed to this virus. Surely, this is going to be a giant test tube and accelerate the adaptive mutations to humans, plus it might figure out how to be much more deadly. 

This is a terrible situation for the poor Chinese people and a world on edge. Hope it all disappears fast. Please Chinese govt. look into your own research on antimicrobial, anti inflammatory herbs. Calming the response of the immune system might hold the key to conquering this virus."
2020-01-31 18:07,"It is totally unacceptable that China knowingly endangered the lives of millions of visitors and populations across the world when it knew that cases of Corona virus started being diagnosed in early December 2019 but it did not acknowledge the epidemic until January 20, 2020. The consequences on China by the international community should be severe as well the lack of trust."
2020-01-31 18:10,"Coronavirus is overrated. Even the common flu kills more people, 1800 people a day and 650000 people in a year. Don’t be paranoid, nothing is gonna happen."
2020-01-31 17:20,"At one point, the NYT had a map that showed where all 3500 airline passengers were flying to each day from Wuhan.

I was shocked to find that thousands of people were flying around the world each day from a Chinese city few outside of China had ever even heard of -- heading to the U.S., France, Italy, places a half a world away.

This global jet-setting is not just contributing to planet-destroying climate change, it's also taking diseases from a festering live-animal food market and spreading them around the globe.

Flights to/from China should've been banned once this problem was known. It shouldn't have taken other governments and airlines this long to take action.

Sure, get foreign nationals out and into quarantine in their home countries, if they wish. And then sterilize the planes when it's done so future passengers on those planes aren't at risk."
2020-01-31 18:37,"Delta, United and American know the risks that the flights to China imply right now."
2020-01-31 18:18,"what is certain is there are no accurate numbers from which to derive a mortality rate.

no accurate number of infected and no accurate number of deaths of those infected.

what is known and accurate is that there is no vaccine—nor a rumor of a vaccine—those not showing symptoms can be infected and contagious and the United States is NOT prepared to cope any better than is China today."
2020-01-31 19:02,"I have seen some concerningly Malthusian comments. To be sure, it is not the hardiest who survive, but more likely the wealthiest, as a result of having better access to healthcare and more easily affording healthier lifestyles. It is better to be sympathetic though, than theorize in this manner, owing survival to circumstantial chance and not declaring mass scale death an essential part of nature's balance. We should collectively be cautious of survivorship bias as this disease progresses."
2020-01-31 19:12,I’m surprised on how the infected were able to travel. Where they infected and not showing symptoms during departures and arrivals from airports until much later?
2020-01-31 19:31,"Air travel is now unreasonably damaging to the environment anyway. In an integrated world where any such outbreak could derail the whole economy, it is time for greater attention to the development and adoption of virtual reality to eliminate the need for such travel. I'm not saying we should ban all travel. I'm saying that we should not depend on it to sustain the world economy."
2020-01-31 19:47,"Those who were evacuated by the US government are being quarantined for two weeks. However, the fact that those coming in from China on commercial flights don’t seem to have any limitations (other than being checked for symptoms at the border) on their movements after entering the country seems reckless."
2020-01-31 20:11,"In certain cases of influenza, a severe overreaction of the immune system known as a 'cytokine storm' may threaten patients more than the flu itself. In these cases the patient may die, not from the virus, but from the body's own overreation to the pathogen.

I think this is something to keep in mind as we see falling stock markets, suspension of flights, expanding quaranteens and screaming headlines. Apparently there are even food shortages now in Wuhan, no doubt due to the general craziness, which is not helping anybody. 

Having lived through SARS in China (though fortunately not in Guangzhou, the epicentre), and, as a foreigner, able to have some perpsective on the panic, I almost think that the Chinese authorities, perhaps with more experience of the irrational tendencies of human nature, were right to try to play down the spread of the disease. Of course, the problems with coverups is that they are eventually exposed, leading to even more distrust. But we should remember that neither we, nor the human body, always have well-calibrated or rational reactions to circumstances."
2020-01-31 21:41,"My question is this: for this particular virus, how long can it survive on hard surfaces, such as plastic or metal? I'm thinking of all the overnight shipping done from China (like iPhones) and opened here a day or two later.

I know most viruses do better on hard surfaces than soft, but is anyone monitoring this vector of the disease?"
2020-01-31 19:20,"If the maximum incubation period is 14 days, most of the Chinese travelers who became sick outside of China were infected in January. But this outbreak started in early December, so were there no infected Chinese traveling internationally in December? Given that we were told about this only in January, nobody, the Chinese travelers themselves, would not know to tested for the Wuhan virus. Did they just get sick then got well and in the meantime infected others who continued the cycle? 

How do we know that among the many Americans afflicted with flu some might have been sick with this virus?"
2020-01-31 20:27,What should occur in NYC is that NYU and Columbia should test 1000 if their students from China to get a random sample to see if any are infected. Many students travel holiday time and it would bring relief to know if anyone is infected? Tests could follow at CUNY fir anyone who travelled to China. Stop waiting for the disease to strike and take active aggressive action to find out statistics .
2020-01-31 21:03,"FINALLY !!!

Trump imposes almost exactly the travel ban and quarantine requirements I have been calling for on these pages for the past 8 days."
2020-01-31 21:53,"Despite indications that this virus is both less infectious and less deadly than measles, some Americans still persist in avoiding routine vaccination.  Where is the logic there?"
2020-01-31 20:07,"Putting the Americans who just returned from Wuhan into quarantine is totally the right thing to do. I wonder why they couldn't decide on that sooner. I am glad also that American, United and Delta Airlines have decided to stop all flights from China.

While this virus is not deadly like Ebola, it has shown itself to be very contagious and have killed immune compromised people; and being a new unknown virus, we really do not moving forward how it will behave and therefore its eventual virulence.

A temporary stoppage of flow of people out of an epidemic zone is prudent and reasonable measure to protect the larger population and has nothing to do with discrimination or being ""mean."""
2020-01-31 20:16,"Influenza kills hundreds of thousands of people per year globally. The corona virus hasn’t even killed 200 people yet. Why cancel flights and put people in quarantine for a virus that’s far less problematic than influenza? It’s a classic case of a ridiculous amount of an ‘abundance of caution.’ It would be laughable except that the reactions to the virus will hurt more people than the virus itself. Economic loss, shortages, and ruined trips/vacations will all be a result of this overreaction. But it sells a lot of newspapers."
2020-01-31 20:20,Africa.  No one is talking about Africa.  There are thousands of Chinese working all over Africa and presumably coming and going from China.  The great majority of African countries do not have the ability or the funds to track every person who gets sick and a major part of the population does not even have access to a doctor or clinic.  Is WHO or any international health agency tracking this in Africa?

2020-01-31 21:04,"I really hope and pray that President Trump and many in his cabinet, especially Wilber (you can call me Wilber) Ross, take this crisis seriously and immediately get on a plane and go to Wuhan, China to get a first hand account of the situation."
2020-01-31 21:17,"I wish we had a real President and a real Administration at a time like this. Instead we have the washings from the live-animal markets. I'm not being funny. I'm expressing bitterness and foreboding about going into this crisis without intelligence, empathy or leadership in the White House, Cabinet or Senate, or in many of the states. These guys will only care about their stocks and their hotel receipts."
2020-01-31 20:18,"Somewhat of an aside -- for now -- but what exactly are they spraying everywhere to disinfect planes and now streets?

Disinfecting streets? I didn't know that was a thing."
2020-01-31 22:25,"Quarantines and travel bans are not used more commonly at the onset of epidemics, when they can do the most good. This is because of fear of economic losses and reluctance to curtail individual freedoms. So we wait instead till its too late and then panic when it won't do much good at all.

Money is of no use to the dead. Freedoms aren't of much use to them either. Staying alive is more important. Early quarantines and travel restrictions should be the standard response in the first few days of any new outbreak, no matter where it happens. Spreading disease is not a fundamental human right. Neither is international tourism."
2020-01-31 23:06,"While watching federal health officials making their announcement today, I couldn't help but wonder if what we were hearing is accurate.  Ever since Trump became president, it's been impossible to be sure any statements by federal employee are true.   You can be sure that if Trump has a personal interest in any aspect of the situation he will try to put his thumb on the scale.  Any thoughts about whether he is doing so in this case?"
2020-01-31 23:31,"This is much ado about very little. Remember the SARS virus 'epidemic' that never happened? The percentage of infected people who've succumbed is far smaller than those infect with the influenza virus. Also, there are many, many different kinds of 'coronaviruses' and it's likely that we have many of them living within us already.  It's simply a media-created epidemic. A few companies will make a lot of money by tapping the NIH for funds to make a vaccine. And the scare will have disappeared before the vaccine is developed. Just as with the SARS virus scare."

Far more people die every year from the influenza every year and although a vaccine exists although not perfect, a large swath of the US choose to not get immunized. Critics may argue it is not as contagious or that the corona has a lot of unknowns but that does not change the bottom line of the mortality rate from other well known diseases. A certain hysteria doubtlessly fuelled by social media seems to be the order of the day."

The fact that Wuhan Corona virus is a WHO worldwide and US health emergency, when deaths in the 1.4 billion population epicenter are in the hundreds, with zero anywhere else, but flu vaccines are not mandatory are not facts that can be reconciled by any rational analysis. Not only are individual humans completely irrational but so are all the systems we have set up, which give us the false sense that there is rationality and order involved. Even a casual reading of all the stories in major news outlets make clear that panic and news sell, and FB an twitter thrive on viral memes, which thrive on emotion and exaggeration.

2020-01-31 23:19,"There are a number of ways of looking at this virus and its fatality rate.  What can be said: It’s way too early for actual facts because there are so many unknowns!  

If you take the number of confirmed infected and compare it to actual deaths, then the virus has about a 2% fatality rate.  Currently, this isn’t a very accurate method!

If you take the number of people who were admitted into hospital, then the fatality rate is 20% (using the same standard for the current flu season gives us a 7% fatality rate.)  The numbers are meaningless because people, who are dying, as a rule, had pre-existing medical conditions.  It is also not that scientific!

What is certain:  A large number of people developed pneumonia before dying.   There is also preliminary evidence of a large number of Cytokines in the bodies of the victims.

So we have a virus that not much is known about, hard to detect without blood tests, possible transmission by people showing no symptoms, and victims with pre-existing medical conditions developing pneumonia.  

Generally healthy people seem to fight off the disease.  It's victims with compromised immune systems dying!

The HHS policy announced this afternoon is pure politics designed to further demonize non-Americans.

2020-01-30 16:02,"I thought this article was very rational in its approach.  My take away is that we need much more research in emerging viral diseases.  My questions would include:  are there predictable genetic factors that predispose virus to cross species lines?  If we are dealing with an influenza model does this virus have the variability of influenza, in other words will we need new vaccines each season or will it be one and done?  Can we develop more and better antiviral drugs?  I think this will require a partnership between government, academia and the pharmaceutical industry and will have great relevance not only for public health but also for our national defense.  As we now see, the rapidity of modern global travel makes it very easy for viruses like this to spread worldwide.  We need to develop global as well as national strategies to address these issues.  Perhaps the United Nations and the WHO will be found to be relevant after all."
2020-01-30 16:25,"The mortality rate of the infected is certainly higher than what the government admits. Chinese social media is flooded with tear-jerking reports from the fallen ones’ families.

However, despite the imminent death of the patient, the doctor declared those were  only “suspected” patients, claiming there was no test kit to confirm the diagnosis. Once the patient died, the body was rushed to be cremated, forever being deprived of a recognized death cause. There could be many reasons for the unfathomable “confirmation refusal” such as limited hospital resource, or reasons I would rather not go further. All in all, i plead the policy makers reconsidering the dire consequence of failing to control this disease."
2020-01-30 16:58,"As a bystander in the US, I am very satisfied with Xi's response.  I mean, building an entire hospital in two weeks!  He was quick to control the spread of the disease, once the severity of it became apparent, by initiating an unprecedented quarantine of an entire large city.  Only a communist government could get away with such a move but, it turns out, to have definitely been needed.  Even with halting all public transportation in Wuhan, the virus still is spreading through China.  I'm sure it's way, way less transmission than it could be, though, and, the rest of the world is certainly thankful to China's draconian response."

2020-01-30 16:18,I think we need to shut down all travel from China immediately. There are cases where sub-clinical persons have transmitted this virus to other persons. Screening travelers coming off airplanes is simply a feel-good procedure and won’t stop the spread of the virus.
2020-01-30 21:50,"A more lethal coronavirus would likely not spread as fast and quickly burn itself out because it kills the host reducing its rate of transmission. SARS and MERS are poorly adapted to use us as hosts. They lethal viruses severely trigger our immune response and the infected get noticed faster and placed into quarantine. 

This new virus is really much worse than SARS and MERS. This virus is much more likely to kill millions because it is a little less lethal making it easier to transmit. If 80% of infected people have common cold symptoms and will continue to spread it then it’s already over. Quarantine only removes the 20% that are seriously ill. 

Were the infected people in countries outside of China only discovered because they had been to China and started to feel sick? If they had not  been to China then would they get tested? If there are not enough test kits, hospital beds or open roads to transport people in China then how will they identify new cases and know the efficacy of their mitigation strategies? What are the strategies and immunotherapy drugs that are effective at keeping that 3% alive? 6,000 people is a statistically significant sample size."
2020-01-31 0:24,"The experts have said it, the best way to prevent spread of infection is distancing and isolation. Chinese people should stop travelling out of country until the epidemic subside. If they don't do it themselves, other countries should stop allowing them into their countries. Checking temperature before flight, after flight etc is futile since evidence have shown a high probability of infected people being contagious during the incubation period. Didn't the woman who was in Germany for a few days for work not symptomatic till she left Germany and nevertheless infected the Germans who worked with her?

Whatever tourist or business dollars the non-Chinese think they may earn, they will spend more on healthcare if the new viral infect catch on in their countries. Moreover, no dollar value can compensate death."

Individual outcomes may be heartbreaking; the 1918 pandemic greatly affected my orphaned grandfather and left  holes in my own family history but communities managed the situation with far less tools than we have today."

2020-01-30 16:31,"Why, Mr. Ross, would you even contemplate saying the things you did?  By your own quote "" I don’t want to talk about a victory lap over a very unfortunate, very malignant disease"", then going ahead and doing so you show a total disregard for humanity and those that have died or are sick.  You also stated ""a prevalence of diseases in China..a factor in businesses leaving the country and relocating to North America"".  On what information is that guess based?  They will only return here?  Why not another country?  Beware of your tunnel vision, Mr. Ross.  Unfortunately it seems you have checked your humanity at the door.  Sad."
2020-01-30 16:39,"Clearly Wilbur Ross lacks a moral compass to have made such a callous remark. What amazes me is how utterly obtuse he is. And, it's a commentary on the caliber of people Donald Trump surrounds himself with."

2020-01-30 16:32,"Wilber Ross declares the coronavirus will drive American corporations to move jobs back to the USA? Rubbish. Corporations these days are about following the money; first, last, and always. If some employees or manufacturers become sick, it’s just the cost of doing business.

And while they’re at it, they may chip away at the employee health care too. You know, because viruses are expensive to treat."
2020-01-30 16:42,"The moral depravity of Commerce Secretary Ross' statement would be remarkable in any administration other than this one.   It is the moral equivalent of saying that Airbus plane crashes are good because they lead to sales opportunities for Boeing. I think that the average six-year-old has a stronger moral compass  than that. 

I could say that such an offensive statement, made as fellow human beings lie sick and dying, can reasonably lead to no other result than an abject apology  and a resignation. However, as matters stand, I  have no hope and no expectations.

I can only add to all Americans, if this administration is re-elected in November, you, all, own this."
2020-01-30 17:03,"The problem is that the figures coming out of China are not reliable, the number of deaths and infections could easily be many times what they are admitting to.   China talks a good game about its response but I suspect the reality is very, very different.   As long a China allows travel outside of its borders the virus will continue to spread.

This might be a good time to switch suppliers for much of our goods and services.  I understand the British might be willing to make a deal or two."

Is this along the same lines as the way the smallpox virus helped the Colonists clear out the native population?"
2020-01-30 17:11,"Just to clarify one thing here. According to news reports, the two cases in Vietnam involved two Chinese nationals who travel in Vietnam. The father flew in from Wuhan to visit his son, who had already stayed in VN, and infected his son. So, the infection was ""imported"" from China and transmitted to another visiting Chinese who had not been in China during the outbreak. The writing by NYT could have been interpreted as something that originated in Vietnam, which was not the case."

One of the worst outcomes of the emergence of new diseases is the irrational responses by illinformed people in governments and the general population.

Authoritarian governments and others who propogate nonsense in the face of danger pose the greatest threat to the health of everyone."

Plain old fashioned, knee jerk reactions that won't change a thing or have any affect on the current crisis!

Folks, you need to stop for a moment and think about this simple fact that the NYT hasn't mentioned... Do you really have any idea as to where your medication is coming from?

You just might want to Google the subject before demanding all flights and other forms of transportation be stopped!

The sad reality is that our country has outsourced a lot of manufacturing to other countries that include China.  

Do you really think that a new Vaccine will be made in the United States?  Do you really think the you will be among the first to get the vaccine, if it is even made in the next few months or year?  

The problem that few Americans understand is that most of our vaccines (and medicine) is made in other country's, including China.  

So with this fact in mind, one of the concerns is: ""During a pandemic, would a vaccine made in another country be distributed evenly to other countries?""

Sadly, the answer is no:  With 1.4 Billion people, I'm betting that, despite contracts and agreements, China would divert their production for their own population!"
2020-01-30 17:25,"Dear Wilbur Ross: Please read ""The Plague"" by Camus and let us know, afterwards, whether you still think in terms of profiting from the Wuhan Coronavirus."
2020-01-30 17:35,The sheer depravity of Mr. Ross is astounding.  It is men like him who exported US jobs to China because they were willing to work for less.  And now he thinks it is a positive for the US that people are dying of this virus in China and these jobs will come back to the US?
2020-01-30 18:07,"According to Forbes & WSJ - 3 months ago - when emerging tariffs have caused companies to relocate, the most common destination has been Vietnam.  I can't imagine why a virus - that has registered fewer cases in Vietnam than in the U.S. - should cause companies to return to the U.S. What's the missing piece of this puzzle, besides Wilbur Ross' imagination?"
2020-01-30 18:22,The Corona virus is different because now there is insufficient data on its true infectivity. The numbers are too small and China's ability to detect all cases and its transparency are suspect. The rapidity of its spread in China is alarming. With each new virus there is the potential for the unknown. Scientists know this and are on top of this as best they can. A global panic will serve no purpose but strict quarantine measures will. i will say nothing further about the conclusion of H.G. Well's classic of a century ago: War of the Worlds.  One thing thankfully absent so far is attempts to politicize this.

Since they've following up with places they've visited, this may be the case. It would see that people living with those with suspected cases would automatically be isolated, as well."
2020-01-30 18:52,"This is about the most uninformed and untrue statement yet to come out on this topic. Robust scientific research has already shown that the Ebola outbreak in 2014 reduced jobs in the US by virtue of reducing exports from the US to Africa. When the economies of other countries suffer for whatever reason, including epidemics, they are less able to buy goods from the US, which hurts the US economically."
2020-01-30 19:03,"The reaction to the virus seems to far outpacing its dangerousness. First I doubt that official Chinese numbers are accurate for the number of infections. So the fraction of those infected that die is likely to be lower than the 3 or so percent that appears to be the case now.  

Second, Is there any reason to think that this virus is any worse in effect than a flu virus?We’ve already had a bad wave of flu rampage though the country this season already without panic."
2020-01-30 19:03,"The influenza epidemic of 2018 had a mortality rate of 2%, the same as with the current virus.  And so if the new virus spreads around the world as easily as the one of 2018, there is a very
big problem.

Moreover, since apparently 20% of the people who catch this

can overwhelm health-care systems."

2020-01-30 18:14,"Wilber Ross is obviously a student of history.  His contention that pandemics which decimate a huge per cent of the population always gives rise to shifting production and rising wages.  The Black Death scourge during and following the Middle Ages is a case in point.  So is the Potato Famine in Ireland.  
Therefore, Ross’s assertion that the Corona Virus will benefit the US manufacturing sector and workforce is justification for hoping that history repeats itself sooner rather than later which obviously would assist in Tump’s re-election along with perhaps returning the Congress to total Republican control.
‘Tis an I’ll wind that doesn’t blow someone some good.  So said Dr. Strangelove."
2020-01-30 17:51,Comment of Wilbur Ross irrelevant: normal in the Trump era. Expect more of it. Ignore and focus on what the experts at the CDC and WHO are saying. They are the ones providing the statements we need to highlight.

Now his Secretary Of Commerce opines that Corona  Virus May be a boon to America, since the jobs may move back to US. Is that how Trump was planning to bring jobs back? It is mind boggling that Mr. Ross can even utter such an absurd idea."
2020-01-30 17:46,"Wilbur Ross strikes again, showing why Trump apparently likes him so much!    

Death, disease, expensive hospitalizations or , perhaps no medical care at all for the uninsured, and grief!  None if those things would bother either of them;  anything to help their personal incomes matters.   

The country is used to Trump’s lack of empathy, compassion, or intelligence.   Hadn’t thought Ross was so close to being the exact same uncaring personality."
2020-01-30 18:10,"As in the case of Ebola, the source of Coronavirus appears to be bush-meat.  Yet in some early articles about the Wuhan situation and the alleged market focal point, I have noted that Chinese Government sources have spoken of a temporary restriction on the sale of bush-meat.  'Temporary', are they incompetent or crazy?  On a related note, allowing travelers to  pass through check points based on a simple temperature scan completely ignores the 5-14 day asymptomatic incubation period which was well known even at the outset is sadly laughable, especially in a person-to-person transmission scenario."

2020-01-30 17:53,"This growing anti-Chinese sentiment was, unfortunately, to be expected. Just as unfortunate is the fear that is likely to be felt by any Chinese national in another country who  has the virus and begins to feel ill. They will be less likely to seek help, and less likely to be quarantined, and we all know what will happen next.

Xenophobia has plagued humans since the beginning of mankind, and it may help an outbreak spread even further globally."
2020-01-30 18:06,"""Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said the coronavirus could be good for the U.S, prompting jobs to move from China to the United States as a result of the outbreak.""

Giving a shady business justification for ""benefits"" of this epidemic  shows he lacks basic human empathy and moral fiber.
No wonder he switched from being a Democrat to Republican affiliation in 2016 and later become part of  Trump government."
2020-01-30 18:18,Hah! C-suite execs and Wall Street speculators won’t let that happen. It would mean that employees would need to be paid a living wage with benefits and comply with real environmental regulations. That would cut into their own salaries and capital gains. More likely scenario is they will simply move production elsewhere to exploit workers in another authoritarian ruled country.
2020-01-30 18:09,"Curious as to why we don't know the demographic of the deaths; are these individuals under or over a certain age, have diminished health capacity or any other factors that may be why they have more readily died to this disease? I would think that is very important to know!"
2020-01-30 17:49,"Secretary Ross clearly doesn’t understand much how to run a manufacturing business. When I open a factory in China, I use their building, machines and labor. To open a factory in America, I have to pay for building, machines and labor. Where can I find capital for such massive initial investment, given that no ones know how long it will last?"
2020-01-30 19:06,"The United States first confirmed case of person to person transmission of the Wuhan Pneumonia Virus has been documented in the Chicago Illinois area!

So it looks as if airport temp screenings and asking people to quarantine themselves isn't working out so well.  Nor does it appear that massive quarantines are working out as wanted.  

No doubt that the quarantines are slowing the spread, just not stopping it!

Most of our medicine is produced overseas.  China makes a lot of medicine for our country.  So any calls to stop flights and other forms of transportation would just hurt Americans.

China is experiencing massive shortages of basic medical supplies now, which means that, since a lot of it is made in that country, the United States can expect shortages as people rush to stock up.

Here in the U.S., we have two types of vaccines designed for bacterial forms of pneumonia.  There is also a list of vaccines that are recommended for people.  Though they do not specifically fight against the Wuhan Pneumonia Virus, I would recommend getting updated so as to prevent problems from secondary infections should you become infected with this new coronavirus.

My personal feeling about vaccines is that for the doctors, nurses and people who don't believe in vaccines and have not bothered to stay updated, or have sent their unvaccinated children to schools - they should wait until everybody else is vaccinated!

(Many children died last year because parents refused measles vaccines!)"
2020-01-30 18:32,"Astonishing that none of these headline making points discuss any scientific facts. For example, China has a system of traditional medicine that is more useful in addressing some health conditions than its more western counterpart, yet China appears unable to address an epidemic. A prior virus emerged in China over a decade ago, and now another similar one emerges, yet there is no discussion as to what could have gone wrong in the intervening one and a half decades for the similar sitation to recur. Also most interesting is that at least one other communist (or communist leaning socialist) country has had a similar even though more attenuated epidemic, while at the same time also having had progresses in its own traditional medicine that make the more western counterparts pale. These, and there are most likely also other, contradictions deserve at least some elucidation and investigation, and are certainly more helpful and interesting to solving the problem than the observation that the spouse of an infected patient caught the virus (it would have been very surprising indeed had that no been so)!"
2020-01-30 18:41,"If Coronavirus had originated in Mexico or West Africa, trump would be insanely howling and tweeting epithets galore. The whole country would be shut down and rounding up and corralling black and brown people would have commenced.

His tepid response to this present-day catastrophe speaks volumes."

Is this the new patriotism?"
2020-01-30 18:27,"Today we are told that there are 7,700 confirmed infections & only 171 deaths. If these numbers are correct - that is unknown, true - the virus is no worse than an ordinary flu.

Yesterday, in Canada it was discovered that a person can be infected & show no signs of illness at all. This suggests the infection rate could be much higher, with many people having no to few symptoms. This would mean that the death rate is even lower than reported.

Perhaps this is more a media-driven panic?"
2020-01-30 18:29,"Mr. Ross, like so many in the Trump administration, thinks of money and profits before people.  Shame on him.  He should be looking for ways that the U.S. could help our Chinese partners, not profit from their problems.  History will recall..."

At this point I’m expecting a pandemic to be a given.  

The question are:  What’s the best treatment if you get it?  And, given that family members, as caregivers, will necessarily have close contact, is washing one’s hands enough?"
2020-01-30 18:43,"Of course people should be prudent, take precaution, always wash hands with soap and hot water. But it should be kept in mind that despite those precautions, and with the benefit of a vaccination (at least in first world countries) some 750,000 people will die this year from the ""standard"" flu virus. Granted, many of those are elderly or otherwise prone to infection due to compromised immune systems, but this is no time to ""panic"" irrationally. Unfortunately, the news media, while trying to convey up to date info., tends to alarm the populace. Just watch your local news for a couple of minutes to see how sensationalized this has become. Their motto ""if it bleeds, it leads"", is apropos for this current coronavirus outbreak."
2020-01-30 18:40,Saying the flu kills more people is not very comforting.  That is like saying cars kill more people than guns do.  Concern is warranted.
2020-01-30 19:33,"Mr. Ross' response to China's problem is not just insensitive but hostile and anti-free trade.
As for the rest, this disease is being treated with sensationalism both by the MSM and governments. WHO should be helping Wuhan, not worrying about a pandemic. Few people have been infected, especially abroad, and only 2-3% die. None have died abroad where there is good medical care. Compare this to Ebola, where the death rate is about 50%, and high even where there is the best care.
It is appropriate to screen people traveling from Wuhan and to attempt to isolate the virus there.
Meanwhile, the flu and measles are much more dangerous in the US, partly because of vaccination refusal or laxity, and by diverting attention from these, the MSM does us ill."

Shortages of masks in our country, many which are made in China, may cause problems for our healthcare professionals.

Folks, the current flu outbreak is stressing our healthcare system as it is also doing in other countries.  This only shows that, despite years of warnings from our scientists, governments and health officials never prepared for the ""When!""

Claims that researchers are working on and getting ready to test vaccines are meaningless.  If you have any basic idea of production, as I do, then it is one thing to make a limited test batch in the lab, it is another issue to ramp up to full scale production!

There are many outbreaks of other diseases going on including flu, measles, Ebola, bacterial pneumonia... and there fewer companies making vaccines... So I am not going to expect 350 million doses being made in the first year of production, which means it will take a while to deal with the Wuhan Pneumonia Virus, if it turns into a pandemic.  

Nor would I expect authoritative governments to allow limited production runs to be shipped out of their countries!

However, there are 4 points re. the ORIGIN of 2019-nCoV worth noting:

1.  The most rigorous study so far (published in The Lancet medical journal) shows the FIRST KNOWN CASE of 2019-nCoV was NOT exposed to the Huanan Market. 

2.  The fact that China's only bsl-4 lab happens to be in the virus epicentre could be a coincidence, but... 

3.  The fact that the Wuhan institute of Virology was researching Novel Bat Coronavirus is a 'coincidence' that stretches credibility. 

4.  In 2017, international scientists expressed concern about the Wuhan lab and China's lack of expertise/transparency in handling deadly pathogens.

The fact that several early patients had never been to the market was the first hint that it might have been spreading among humans before Dec. 12, 2019, when Chinese authorities first took note of the infection.

""Unless you know a virus’ reservoir, efforts to quash it are a little like trying to mop up a flooded bathroom floor before turning off the sink faucet, says University of Minnesota infectious disease expert Michael Osterholm.

It is ridiculous that the US government brought hundreds of people into this country from Wuhan- and then only required monitoring for three days (when they knew the period without symptoms is 14 days).

Well if not all of these pigs were killed then there is the possibility that this new disease or virus is tied to these pigs not bats which were sold on the black market . Does North Korea have any individuals with the new virus? If not they maybe involved in some manner with this virus. How would this not spread to North Korea if China and North  Korea exchange products and travel? So mysteriously a snake or a bat could set off human to human transmission . Based on what scientific evidence ? Why did this not occur previously in all of Asia ? Very suspicious. No it looks like someone or group were involved in spreading this disease.

81 deaths from Heparin?  China

Recent reports of continued fraud and manipulation of quality data from Pharmaceutical company's?  China

 Just going by the number of deaths vs number recovered indicates the mortality rate *might* be much higher..but then we don't know the true number of infected if there are people who are mostly asymptomatic not seeking treatment...so there's no way to really tell the true numbers at this point (the Chinese govt may have more accurate numbers but if they do they're not reporting it for some reason...)

So please stop saying this isn't more worrying that the flu. There is simply not enough information available at this point to make any kind of pronouncement like that."

I am not clear on what the significant concern of the Wuhan virus is given that it appears to be similar to influenza in effect.  Perhaps I've missed something significant, but what is the difference between influenza and Wuhan coronavirus in terms of potential impact that necessitates the continued level of response and concern?"

This new virus is novel, meaning that humans are extremely prone to infection, morbidity and mortality from it because our immune systems can not adequately mount a response against its surface antigens. Although flu virus mutates every year (and within years) and also presents varied components to our immune systems making it difficult to defend against, we have the ability to predict (with varying accuracy) what strains will predominate each year and can as such produce prophylactic vaccines. Not so with novel and emergent viruses. This virus is also more contagious than typical flu, and severe symptoms are seen in 20% of those infected, a much higher percent than typical flu. There are case reports of 1 infected person transmitting the virus to at least 14 people. This is very concerning."

Complaining about how people are comparing the Wuhan Pneumonia Virus with the flu is wasted time.  Especially when scientists out of the UK are doing that while being interviewed on DW news.  

Interestingly, the scientist did bring up a comparison between the two viruses that made sense.  

Currently, of the people who are hospitalized for the flu, they have a 7% mortality rate.  Currently, of the people who are hospitalized for the Wuhan Pneumonia Virus, they have a 20% mortality rate.  

Please note: The scientist was careful to compare mortality rates for those who are hospitalized.

He did not compare numbers of infected.  He didn't try to compare infectious rates or transmissions - he compared it by those who were hospitalized!

Yes, there will always be a different way of looking at this situation.  Yes, not enough is known.  Yes, they still are learning more.  Yes, the final numbers are not in yet..  But that still doesn't change the fact that as a general rule, if you are hospitalized, you have a 1 in 5 chance of dying!

Why aren’t there travel bans to the U.S. during flu season, when scores of people don’t get flu shots, forget about proper anti-flu hygiene, etc. etc. etc.? Should we all be wearing masks here? 

Yes track the coronavirus, but don’t forget we have issues here with our own viruses even if they don’t have scary, mysterious names. Rebrand the “flu” so less people die and protect themselves before the season starts. Otherwise the “flu” sounds like a common basic “friend” that “doesn’t kill”...."

2020-01-31 3:30,"I’m a physician. This virus is not the flu. It is potentially much more dangerous.

According to Up To Date, which is a resource for physicians to educate themselves on current medical knowledge:

 “ The illness is characterized primarily by fever, cough, dyspnea, and bilateral infiltrates on chest imaging. The incubation period of 2019-nCoV is thought to be within 14 days following exposure. Although many of the reported infections are not severe, approximately 20 percent of confirmed patients have had critical illness (including respiratory failure, septic shock, or other organ failure requiring intensive care). Most of the fatal cases have occurred in patients with underlying medical comorbidities.”

20% is a very significant number. The flu does not cause severe illness in 20% of patients. Those affected by severe versions of this illness, if they escape death those infected may still suffer permanent loss of function, wellness, and livelihood. And the added cost of intensive  medical care will burden communities. 

A 14 day incubation period is massive compared to the flu (1-4 days). Many, many, many more close contacts will be infected before a person realizes they are sick and quarantines themself.

And lastly, we do not understand how rapidly this virus is mutating and evolving. It may become more transmissible, more potent, more lethal.

The WHO was right in declaring a global emergency. I hope people take this virus very seriously."

China is in crisis mode now, trying to treat a disease that has the potential to mutate and become even more serious."

This is a matter of trying to control the spread until we know more and have more options."

The virus can incubate for 12 days. 
Once again it’s our government opting for the cheapest way out.

In my opinion, panic and irrationality that could potentially ensue would be almost as dangerous as the virus itself. 

For example, perhaps there can be repeated reassurance that food supplies will not run out and grocery stores will remain fully stocked, etc."
2020-01-31 6:00,I don't think American people should worry too much about this Coronavirus outbreak. China probably is going to take care this problem very shortly. I been to Wuhan twice in the past many years. My first time when I was a school kid in 1938. During the Japanese invasion of China. Later our family moved to Hong Kong. As a kid I didn't like the city. Because the city was too dirty and boring and not many places for kids to enjoy. The second time I visited Wuhan was in 1979 because I was there to do some research about China's higher education so I met the Wuhan University president and I told him that I felt that Wuhan was a city neglected by Chinese leaders for modernization of the city and nearby areas. He agreed and he told me he felt the same. Now 40 years later the city is now in big trouble which probably will affect the US-China relation ans also relations with other western nations. It probably will take a long time for Wuhan to regain her reputation as an industrial city. But we all hope Chinese leaders and western leaders will work together to help Wuhan to recover from this devastating Coronavirus outbreak. But my childhood poor memory about Wuhan will be with me for a long time. My friends in Hong Kong and Taiwan just don't get too panic about it. But for this coming year I would suggest Americans should go somewhere for vacations not going to China. Too bad for China's economy. I am old but I still remember the good old bad days.

2020-01-31 15:28,"This epidemic issue is causing alarm and concern to all. We need to look at what this does when we concentrate on one place for the supply chain. This is not just a problem for China. The impact is felt here at home, and to the rest of the world. To have allowed China to be a 'world production center', it is not China's fault. We allowed that to happen. China is not the only country that offers the desired key factors of production (such as land and labor). There are many other locations, in Asia, Africa, Latin America, more friendly and dependable countries to the US. Not to ignore places, here at home. 
It is time all those businesses, old and new, who moved their plants to China, do realize and learn the lessons on the pros and cons of focussing their needs on one location. The next time, it will not be an epidemic, to cause an alarm. It will come in other forms. Perhaps, an economic or financial meltdown, or a natural disaster. Yet, will we learn?"

It is possible that the diversion to March air base is due to the presence of one or more likely or confirmed cases of coronavirus on the plane. Ontario International airport is heavily used by commercial airlines traveling to and from locations all over the world, whereas March air base has much less traffic and a higher level of internal and external security than Ontario airport does. 

It is not clear whether March air base currently has appropriate quarantine and medical facilities, and whether they can accommodate over 200 potential patients.

People and local doctors are scared to talk when they first detect it. Local authorities and even Central authority generally suppress all such news, which they perceive as negative. Gradually the disease spreads below the radar and then suddenly it explodes, mainly when it's detected outside China or among other people living in China. By then, it's too late."

To re-emphasize — bats are most dangerous when humans initiate irresponsible contact with them. Untrained people should never purposefully contact bats and most other wildlife. A bat box in your yard is great (and fun!), but don’t touch even dead bodies with bare hands and don’t eat them!"

Mangoes and avocados are mainly insect-pollinated; their flowers are quite small and hardly provide enough reward for a bat. All commercial bananas are parthenogenic and do not require pollination - it is only the native Asian species that would require pollination, and they produce large, hard seeds that could likely break your teeth if you bit into them. There is a lot of misinformation on bat pollination on various web pages, and many of them mysteriously refer to the ""US Forest Service Rangeland Management Botany Program"", which I could not find information on and which would hardly be qualified to be reporting on bat pollination anyways. Otherwise congratulations on a fine article. Paul Berry (University of Michigan emeritus botany prof)"

When articles like this stress gaining ""knowledge and monitoring of bats"" to prevent the spread of their viruses to human beings, and neglect to mention the role of bats in ecology,, it's a mere hop, skip and jump for homo sapiens to decide bats meed to be eradicated. After all, that's our general approach, throughout all of history, to all wild animals--understand and control, then wipe out.

I realize this article doesn't call for the eradication of bats, but people are often stupid about these things, and draw the wrong conclusions because knowledge is always and forever incomplete. Mao caused an ecological disaster with his ""Four Pests"" campaign. Part of it was to eradicate sparrows, which, in Chinese fashion, was completely effective. The problem was this led directly to the spread of locusts."
2020-01-29 14:52,"This is a wonderfully informative article.

It's unfortunate for the bats that the 19th paragraph, about bats themselves as blameless, rather than human encroachment and predatory behavior, wasn't further up in the column. Reading half the column could inspire the killing of bats out of fear and panic.

There is a worldwide decline in bat populations likely caused by humans (including researchers) disturbing their habitat and introducing pathogens TO THEM and global warming, which disrupts their hibernation, food supply, etc..
We seem to know enough about them to be cautious and respectful toward them and to simply keep ourselves from encroaching on their worlds.

But whichever the case, it really makes me wonder about the strength of the Chinese economy when this outbreak (and others in the past) could likely have been prevented if the government put its own citizens' safety above their dietary preferences and shopping practices that keep causing these outbreaks.

Governments around the world need to educate the public on health and safety when handling and cooking wild foods. New Zealanders eat wild foods and don't get these illnesses because of health and safety regulations in NZ being very strict and fines being heavy for being unlicensed.

incredible that the China  government issued a statement that the commerce in wildlife will be suspended temporarily.  Temporarily?  That will for sure guarantee another disease and panic in the not too distant future.  China being a
geographically large country with a population huge and diverse, to eradicate the wildlife commerce is understandably very challenging.  However, people's habits and customs must change, human behavior being the ultimate culprit in this scenario, and that change is most likely if extremely strong prohibition occurs coupled with aggressive education about need for more 'civilized' eating habits."

2020-01-29 19:40,"The bat article referenced for their adaptation to flight and lack of inflammation is missing the key detail. Yes, the inflammation response is likely subdued but it is made up elsewhere with interferon alpha. Excessive interferon alpha stimulates the immune system to create more B cells. 

Interferon alpha is also a drug given to chemo patients with weakened immune systems. If people have a normal mammalian inflammatory response and a lower level of B cells than bats then we would fight off a bat virus in a suboptimal way. 

An infection creates pneumonia due to the inflammatory response of the lungs which is what is killing people. As a science journalist can you find out if the chemo drug interferon alpha is being used to treat people with this coronavirus? I am especially interested in people who are older with underlying health conditions and weakened immune systems. Also I would like to know the name of the companies that produce the drug and their stock symbol. K, thanks!"

Having had a huge garden for the last almost 42 years, where I have washed in very hot water all of the vegetables before I used them, and also the cantaloupes, watermelons, apples, even grapes, etc., the fact that we have lots of older trees, and have had about 4 bats get into our older home over that time period, makes me wonder about viruses, disease, etc.  I had two children, who had very little sickness growing up compared to the other children, even though we lived in an older home where I had to set mouse traps every fall, and was adamant about hand washing, etc.  There are plenty of questions to be answered about transmission of viruses, immunity, and hopefully a vaccine for the deadly corona viruses, especially SARS, MERS,  and now this one."

2020-01-29 14:32,"I lived in Florence, Italy one summer and quickly came to appreciate the bats that ate mosquitos (preventing the mosquitoes from dining on us). 
It seems that the problem with bat-borne viruses is that in some places, people handle and eat them. Not surprising, but dangerous."
2020-01-29 18:00,"It may be that being able to harbor so many viruses provides an evolutionary advantage to bat species. Bats, all fragile and delicate in their own right, still have to compete with each other and with other animals for access to food and suitable roosting locations, so hosting a virulent virus without suffering its affects may act as a defensive weapon against incursions into a swarms territory. If this is happening, then it’s an example of biological warfare carried out on an evolutionary timescale, each bat species ratcheting up the viral load and virulence generation by generation as it seeks to perpetuate its existence. 

By harvesting these animals, and co housing them with other species in crowded markets, we may have inadvertently invited this evolutionary battle onto ourselves."
2020-01-29 15:27,"Wild animals carry many pathogens that were contained within their species until humans came along and through deforestation and development, diet for bushmeat, etc. have upset the balance - particularly in the open markets such as the one described in Huwan, there were multiple wild species of animals contained within close proximity or maybe slaughtered using the same chopping block - scientists are trying to find out. Zoonotic disease will probably occur more often if we do not curb our population numbers and our diet for animal protein."
2020-01-29 20:52,"Considering the amount of fear everyone seems to have about this virus perhaps people should consider the fact that the CDC estimates almost 80,000 people in the USA alone died of INFLUENZA in 2018.  There have been about 200 known deaths from this virus at the moment.  And despite the death rate of Influenza most people do not even make the effort to get a vaccination which is widely available.  While the new virus is troubling in its ability to spread so rapidly it is probably much less of a risk then the Flu.  The point people should be concerned about is that we have known for years that this was likely to happen and nothing has been done to prepare for it.  The outbreak of bat linked epidemics were predicted long before this happened.  This is in fact what Ebola is as well.  People should if anything take this as a serious warning and start doing what can in order to prepare for something with an ability to spread like this new virus but an ability to kill a much greater percentage of the people infected with it.  Basically what a human transmissible Ebola virus could do.  This could easily wipe out 20% of the human population.  On the positive side an epidemic which wiped out 10-50% of humanity (like previous epidemics) would go a long way towards reducing over population."

So ill-informed bat vigilantes will target bats for extermination.  Then as temperate zones become tropical with climate change and we are beset with deadly mosquito-carried diseases, people will be crying, ""Where are all the bats?""

2020-01-29 20:32,"People, please check your attics and see any signs of bats! Once I lived for 2 years in an old house infested with bats. They made their dwelling in the attic and I had no idea about it until I got into the attic one day and saw a huge pile bat guano. I never went back. I'm pretty sure the air in that attic was toxic. I could feel it. It was evil. I could not breathe in there. There was also a lot of bat urine stain marks in the bathroom that seeped through from the attic. Despite all this evidence, when I mentioned about it to the landlady, she tried to convince me that it's all good. The guano pile and the bats had been there for 40 years and there had not been any problems. Yeah, right. I'm pretty sure whatever spore, bacteria or virus that they carry might have affected her brain too, not only my respiratory system. I did have some difficulty breathing while I was living there, but I thought it was just my allergy to dust. I moved out not long after I discovered the bats issue."

2020-01-29 19:20,"This kind of press leads to people killing bats outright, or putting up exclusion contraptions to keep them from roosting. Bats are a crucial part of the ecosystem, and should be encouraged and protected. Don’t blame bats for the mutation and spread of novel viruses. Blame the humans who cage, torture, sell and slaughter illegally caught — often endangered — wild animals in the live food markets of Asia. Blame irresponsible meat farmers who keep animals in filthy conditions. This is about cross contamination  and poor animal husbandry, not about bats. 

Bats everywhere are threatened already by loss of habitat and a fatal and virulent nose disease that is spreading quickly. Their numbers are falling. For 24 years I had bats roosting on my house every summer, eating all of our mosquitos. Last summer I had no bats roosting here. We were plagued by mosquitos. 

Provided roosting habitat for bats without worry. If you keep livestock, keep them in clean and humane conditions. Be sensible and responsible."

2020-01-29 20:07,"China's insatiable appetite for wildlife not only threatens all of humanity with grave diseases, it is also responsible for the impending extinction of countless species in the wild: tigers, several bear species, sharks, many species of pangolin, the world's smallest dolphin, river dolphins, uncountable species of birds and reptiles.  To say nothing of elephants, rhinos, and all other species disappearing to feed the bottomless market for Chinese 'medicine'.

Only a small fraction of humanity cares about the natural world, but everyone cares about deadly epidemics.  The Chinese government has the ability to shut down all wildlife markets overnight, and could severely curtail the demand for ivory and all the bits and pieces of disappearing wildlife devoured by their superstitious citizens.  The world must demand an end to the dangerous and destructive decimation of the planet's dwindling animal life."
2020-01-29 19:07,"So is the idea that bats get sick from these viruses, but because they have a weakened immune response, they don't die from the inflammation? The cited research only suggests they don't get as much inflammation, not that they don't get sick."
2020-01-29 19:37,"If scientists were fully aware that the next big outbreak would originate from bats, why were animal markets still allowed to sell them in China? 

The State in China needs to acknowledge the connection between tradition and reality better and pay attention to their scientists. Hardliner desire to quell the people with ""tradition"", mixed with dangerous opportunistic exploitation equals a society as mutated as a virus. Wet markets are literally a soup of pathogens. I thank any Chinese activists who are trying to prevent not only global pandemics, but the awful inhumane practice of the reckless yet lucrative wildlife trade."

2020-01-29 22:01,"So much discussion about how bats could transmit this pathogen when a far more rational explanation exists.

Wuhan is home to a level 4 biohazard containment lab - the Wuhan Virology Institute.

It recently was seeking to hire one or two post-doc fellows, who will use ""bats to research the molecular mechanism that allows Ebola and SARS-associated coronaviruses to lie dormant for a long time without causing diseases.""

It sure seems like China was doing research on corona viruses and bats for whatever reasons - though it is difficult to avoid speculation about bioweapons.   Something escaped the lab.  Whether a full blown weapon or some intermediate stage development isn't known but the long latent stage is a characteristic that is desirable in a bioweapon, allowing it to spread undetected.

Why are the NYT and others going on and on about the natural transference of a virus from bat to man without any mention of research on just such a pathogen going on in a biohazard lab in Wuhan?"
2020-01-30 1:12,"Once I was riding my bike near a small village on the island of Sumbawa, in Indonesia. A local man came out from his home to greet me, holding his pet fox bat. It was hanging from his arm like from a tree branch. He opened a bottle of Fanta orange soda and asked me, in English, if I wanted to feed it. I turned him down, but he proceeded anyway and the bat, still upside down, nearly gulped it all down, my jaw hanging open. Before I said a word,the man finished off the soda. I asked him if he ever got sick from doing that, and he just shrugged."

The vaccine will be ready in 3-6 months unless the government decide to put it through all the efficacy hoops before it gets deployed.  Second the transmission rates are not that big (each diagnosed patient infect an average of only 2.6 people, even though they can go undiagnosed and infective for up to 2 weeks).

The detection and monitoring of infections, as well as the development of vaccines, will put an insurance policy in place for future outbreaks, he said.

The above is a key needed step by world health organizations, and they need to collaborate openly to do so.. because virus' know no national boundaries, nor cultural bias.

Uhhh, thanks for that reassuring comparison Doc  but I think I'd rather take my chances with regular flu than a new pandemic virus that has no vaccines and is more lethal.  The same goes for driving my car and getting in and out of bathtubs."
2020-01-29 3:22,"""For perspective: The flu kills roughly 35,000 Americans every year. This season, it has already sickened an estimated 15 million Americans and killed 8,200, according to C.D.C. estimates.
Influenza kills more Americans every year than any other virus, Dr. Peter Hotez, a professor at Baylor College of Medicine, told Liz Sabo at Kaiser Health News. But the flu is rarely paid such attention, and fewer than half of adults get a vaccine.""

This would be a good time to remind people to get the vaccine, especially elderly, chronically ill, and anybody with any common sense, after being advised  by one's physician. 

Worried about Coronavirus? Not much. About the flu? You bet. Did I get the vaccine? Of course."
2020-01-29 4:06,"I think in ALL situations it is better to react with a cool and level head than to freak out, etc. It is never useful to overreact. But it is easier said than done.

Drugs that work against SARS are likely to work against this virus (86% similarity in the polyprotein sequence - checked it ourselves) and we're working on discovering new drugs that already approved that may be useful against this virus. For SARS, we predicted that HIV protease drugs would be useful against the SARS proteinase and this was confirmed by other groups. So we'll try again specifically to this virus and see what we get. Our paper on this was awarded the most cited from 2003-2006 in the journal it was published.

If we went at it with 100% effort, we could do it in a few hours but we're working on  a lot of things right now and on top of it our platform is only about 20-25% accurate (but the goal is to get it up so that in the future this becomes routine). So we'll give it a shot. Main issue is testing since it requires a BSL4 facility."
2020-01-29 4:40,"It is highly contagious so it will spread like wildfire. Abilities to contain any contagion in any country are negligible, despite what the government or institutions might say. So far it hasn't been very virulent, but it can mutate and become more lethal at any time."
2020-01-29 5:01,"Of course, I am worried about this illness since we don't have a vaccine to prevent this illness at this time
   This is a deadly virus and it has spread quickly to many parts of China besides Wuhan and has spread to the US and thirteen other countries in Asia, Australia, and Europe within a month. 
    As of January 26, the 2019-ncov virus has infected more than 2700 people and has killed more than eighty.
    This situation is similar to another pandemic the SARS, that is also a Coronavirus
    In 2002-2003, SARS spread to more than two dozen countries, infecting more than 8000 people and killing 774."
2020-01-29 4:12,"Right now anyone in the US should not be worried too much about the Wuhan Corona Virus (WCV) because the sleeping giants China and USA have been awakened and are doing a lot to contain the spread of the virus. Since the epicenter is Wuhan, China has closed off its exit points out of a large regions and Hong Kong has closed off entry points from China. The US is no longer receiving flights from Wuhan and many departure points from China. So there is a trickle of cases going out of China all over the world in every continent except Antarctica and Africa.

Being a virus transmitted by the respiratory route, WCV is as dangerously contagious as pandemic influenza virus strains and more dangerous than HIV and Hepatitis C virus (HCV) which are not transmitted by the respiratory route but by the parenteral route. 

Panicking will be unproductive. There are a lot of scary unknowns about the WCV that should not give rise to complacency, which is not good either. It is better to be safe than sorry. Everyone should continue with common sense hygienic practices like 1) proper hand washing with detergent containing hand washing soap by leaving the soap applied for a minute before rinsing, 2) In case there is news that the contagion is spreading in the US, wearing masks that will trap aerosols as well as virus particles, and also wearing eye protection. Avoid traveling to places where there have been cases of WCV infected persons, avoid contact with exotic imported animals or wild animals."
2020-01-29 5:42,"High fatality rate is lesser an issue if the disease can be stopped from spreading, which is the case for MERS and SARS. In both cases a virus-carrying patient only become infectious after symptoms show up; therefore it's easier to contain the spread.

While a typcial seasonal influenza is highly contagious, it has a typical mortality rate of only 0.13%. On average about 500 millions worldwide catch seasonal flu, and about 650,000 died each year.

The 1918-1919 Spanish Flu have the unfortunate combination of high fatality rate and highly contagious. About 500 millions were infected and an estimation of 50 millions died from it.

This novel Wuhan coronavirus so far has shown fatality rate of 2-3%, a figure that is still changing. There have been reports (but not confirmed) that it 'might be contagious' even before any symptom shows up; which could potentially make it harder to stop the spread. Let's hope this is not the case.

Frequent hand washing and wearing mask are the keys to protect individual."
2020-01-29 6:43,"Just like any other imperative virus, after an outbreak panic follows. This time it is the coronavirus, originated in Wuhan, China. Along with the sickness itself there are other connotations that the article highlights. It is very interesting to see how misinformed, at least in my case, individuals are as it is an ""old"" disease. You could also say that this is a “mutation “or the virus holds new and improved genetics. However, it is also important to note that while it affects physical health it also affects emotional health. 

The article also highlights the racist effects. For example, it targets people from Asia or Asian descent where instead of help being provided, fingers are being pointed. The sickness indeed was generated due to an exotic diet by eating bats. Still, once the virus spreads, it takes innocent and for the most part, victims who did not indulge in such exotic pleasures. 

As individuals in a global society, we must help one another because we are more connected now than ever. Rather than blaming the epidemic and immediately panicking, we must get more informed. Just as the article highlights, other commonly known diseases such as influenza and the flu are even more threatening, but the difference is that we are accustomed to it. 

Today the outbreak is taking place in China, however tomorrow it could be anywhere else in the world. Further research, control, and consideration needs to take place to battle diseases and prevent them as well."
2020-01-29 12:57,"So this opinion is a day old. More have died and more cases have appeared. We still don't know how to stop it and there is not surety that we ever will. 

I understand the need for calm but the best way to do that is for officials to show they are taking meaningful measures. In this case, they are not. ""It's racist"", ""it's an overreaction"", ""there is not cause for alarm"", ""the flu kills more"". None of those comments are worth a dime in prevention.

First it was not airborne, now it is. First it was not transmissible by people without symptoms, now it is. If you want the public trust, you have to earn it.

A travel ban is unnecessary, until it's not. China has so far locked down 15 cities. Surely they wish they had been able to act sooner. Will the USA say the same, when it is too late?"
2020-01-29 13:10,"Flu seems to have a death rate of 1/2 of 1%. The corona virus seems to be about 3%. While RIGHT NOW fewer cases, it is more deadly, although not as bad as SARS. If it ever takes off in the US or elsewhere there will be more deaths than we see from the flu."
2020-01-29 14:51,Some misinformation here.  It's being transmitted without sneezing and coughing and those aren't primary symptoms if I read correctly.
2020-01-29 3:56,"Funny the neighboring article says ""Scientists rush to develop vaccine"". Sure, its no biggie, you should be worried about the flu - but hey we are RUSHING to make a vaccine."
2020-01-29 4:49,"People should not worry because there's nothing we can do in the event of a pandemic, we don't have the means or will to impose a working quarantine and never had. The best we can do is pray it is not very lethal and let it die out."
2020-01-29 4:13,"Death rate from the flue: 1 in 10,000. Current best estimate of the death rate from the coronavirus: 2 in 100. The coronavirus is 200 times more fatal! If as many people got the coronavirus as the flue in the US, 7,000,000 mil Americans would die. When Dr. William Schaffner, a professor at Vanderbilt University Medical Center, says “When we think about the relative danger of this new coronavirus and influenza, there’s just no comparison,"" he is right, but in the wrong direction! Ms. Sabo is right when she writes. “For them, the flu is old news. Yet viruses named after foreign places — such as Ebola, Zika and Wuhan — inspire terror.” Yes, it's all xenophobia. Precautions like that suggested by Coulter of banning travel from China--racism."
2020-01-29 8:21,"Of course it is inevitable that a city like New York, with a huge Chinese population going back and forth to mainland China is going to get the coronavirus.  New York, coastal California and Vancouver have such large populations of Chinese, it will be amazing if there aren't some infected people coming back unknowingly or knowingly.  No doubt many fled China as the news spread.  The mayor of Wuhan said 5 million fled the city before the lock-downl"
2020-01-29 16:07,"Unfortunately, we do not have a vaccine at this time that worries me but things are changing.
   Historically, vaccines have been one of the greatest public health tools to prevent disease. It took researchers about 20 months to develop a vaccine against SARS in 2003 and six months when the Zika epidemic struck in 2015. Scientists want to halve that time with the coronavirus. 
     I am happy to note that Scientists in Australia and at least three companies — Johnson & Johnson, Moderna Therapeutics and Inovio Pharmaceuticals — are also working on vaccine candidates to stop the spread of the disease, which has infected about 6,000 people and killed more than 130. But pharmaceutical companies will not move fast enough unless there is a financial incentive
   However, I am optimistic that the CDC, Atlanta will come up with a vaccine very soon. Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases at the N.I.H., is saying that the vaccine research is moving quickly. He said: “If we don’t run into any unforeseen obstacles, we’ll be able to get a Phase 1 trial going within the next three months, which will be record speed,”"
2020-01-29 10:21,"More and more evidence is indicating a link to the Wuhan Institute of Virology - a level 4 biohazard containment lab that has been doing research n corona viruses and bats.

In November the Institute was seeking to hire one or two post-doc fellows, who will use ""bats to research the molecular mechanism that allows Ebola and SARS-associated coronaviruses to lie dormant for a long time without causing diseases.""

The person heading this research is Dr. Peng Zhou.   Searching for him will reveal far more information.

It is far more likely that this virus escaped from the level 4 lab in Wuhan than a natural cross over occurred in a live animal market.
The long dormant period would be very useful in an engineered bioweapon.

If this outbreak is related to a bioengineered virus, things are likely to get far worse.

While the media may not be reporting this possibility for fear of causing panic it seems that panic is already occurring in China."
2020-01-30 1:00,"SARS outbreak originated in China because Chinese people were eating Civet cats.

It is possible that the diversion to March air base is due to the presence of one or more likely or confirmed cases of coronavirus on the plane. Ontario International airport is heavily used by commercial airlines traveling to and from locations all over the world, whereas March air base has much less traffic and a higher level of internal and external security than Ontario airport does. It is not clear whether March air base currently has appropriate quarantine and medical facilities, and whether they can accommodate over 200 potential patients.

Just today, there is an opinion piece in the NYT by a physician who pronounced masks wearers, on an admittedly half empty street in China, ""uninformed"". Then she goes on to say that masks make sense in crowded areas with high infection rates. So, would a better informed person only don the mask when they arrive at the crowded grocery store? As I understand it, the fewer times you fuss with it the better. So, on the teeming and international streets of NYC, and the sardine can packing on mass transit, why are masks not sensible as cheap insurance? Not to mention that flu is still quite widespread."

When you argue for a smaller federal government, and you promote secrecy, this is the logical outcome."
2020-01-29 15:16,"From reading your interesting article on how bats live with many viruses, it strikes me that in our hyper-allergic, over-excited immune system population, this virus would elicit rather a terrible response. Yes, folks are working on the vaccine, but would it not be better and more sensible to figure out if perhaps antihistamines might work to help people combat this disease? Maybe dim the response just like in bats. 

Please eat homemade yoghurt, easy enough to make it ( no need to buy any special equipment) and much more friendly lactic acid bacteria to aid gut inflammation. I suspect in the end all our responses come down to the integrity of the gut lining and the gut immune system."
2020-01-29 15:28,"Containment has failed-since the virus can be spread by clinically symptomatic persons via person to person contact or via symptomatic coughs or sneezes producing aerosolized moisture containing an inhalable viral load (the exact mechanism for infection is not yet dispositively understood for cases of transmission) - airport screenings are relatively useless for containment as they only identify people showing clinical symptoms and fail to identify people who are infected but asymptomatic or subclinical in regard to infection.  Hence, containment fails so long as airports operate  and carry hosts around the globe.  At this point, the infection (which thankfully has a relatively low mortality rate but which bears alarming similarities to the Spanish Influenza pandemic of 1918-1920) could of course mutate into a much more virulent form and is a dire risk to elderly and immune system compromised patients or those with COPD or Asthma or other pulmonary disease.    The pandemic is by its nature spread like fire and so long as combustible materials exist, contagion is difficult.  The race now is to contain the spread long enough for a vaccine to become available for healthcare workers as the risk is that overburdened hospital workers walk off the job as they and their coworkers and families are put at risk.    That would cause chaos and open the lid of Pandora's box further - a commercially available vaccine is months if not over a year or more from availability."
2020-01-29 15:50,"The most concerning fact (?) I heard was that the Coronavirus can be spread while people are asymptomatic. If true, this means that allowing passengers, or any exposed person, into the US before they have been properly quarantined will only spread the virus. I think numbers will sharply rise before this thing is contained. Given the very poor and slow response from China and even the US, a pandemic of some kind will eventually happen."

There is nothing magical about Wuhan itself, the issue is the people who live, work, or visit the area.  They spread the contagion when they leave China as the Wuhan tour group did in Japan and the Chinese coworker did in Germany.  It is past time to isolate China.  ALL flights to and from China should be suspended.  Anyone attempting to fly to the US from other countries and has been in China at any time in the past month should be screened, and if the visit was within 14 days, said individual should not be allowed aboard a US-bound flight."

The scientists appear to agree that the source are “ wild animals “, while the horrific human treatment of these accused wild animals goes unmentioned. How those animals are caught, caged, sold and butchered in those markets might give almost anyone pause and most considerable motivation to insist that the horror is ended, even before a virus erupts to threaten the perpetrators and the innocent alike. 
I believe responsibility should be placed on both the horrific treatment of animals as well as those people and cultures who practice it, not the animals themselves. We should be ending it, but we are not even talking about it."

Flu mutates, which is why we need annual shots of flu vaccine. HIV mutates in a stunning speed, which is why we cannot design an effective vaccine yet. But mutated flu is still flu, HIV is still HIV."

Finally, it has an incubation period of ten to fourteen days (longer than common flu strains).
Pompeo and co. will do what they can not to cause damage (temporary) to the economy but the reality is, when it comes to this virus (and viruses to come) better safe than sorry."
2020-01-29 16:53,"""Government scientists in China, the United States and Australia, as well as those working at Johnson & Johnson, Moderna Therapeutics and Inovio Pharmaceuticals are all engaged.""

When a virus like this hits, it is essential that all hands be on deck, including the government and very much including pharmaceutical companies, such as Johnson and Johnson.

A few years ago, there was understandable panic over Ebola cases in the US. Today, effective vaccines and treatments for Ebola  are becoming available, in large part due to the efforts of drug companies.

With luck and a lot of work, the same thing will happen with the corona virus.

But it is worth noting that our pharmaceutical companies are today facing an existential threat: American trial lawyers.  For example, multiple billion dollar verdicts have been levied by juries against Johnson and Johnson for baby powder, its alleged role in the opioid epidemic, and its drug risperdal.  It takes only a few billion dollar judgments to bankrupt a company. Most of the verdicts are grossly disproportionate, and many, probably most, are based on junk science.

During the 1970's and 1980's our out of control liability system threatened the very existence of vaccine availability in the US; only when Congress passed a no-fault liability law at the 11th hour, the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act, was vaccine availability able to continue.

Offit chooses to ignore some important information. The death rate so far from the corona virus is about 2-3% of those infected. The death rate from the annual flu is about 1/10 of 1%. Sounds to me like some officials are distorting the potential severity of the corona virus. Chinese officials have stated that the corona virus can be spread during the incubation period. US officials say they need to see proof of that. Hello? Wait for proof???? Should it become a pandemic (due to lack of precautionary controls like appropriate quarantines) and infect 45 million people like the annual flu did in 2017-18 season, the death rate at 2% would be 900,000 people, compared to the 35,000 people infected and dying from the annual flu which Offit cites.
No brainer. Quarantine. 14 days."
2020-01-29 17:20,"I appreciate the NYTimes coverage of this story, but there is some information that I haven't yet seen:  What is happening with people who survive this virus?  More specifically, of the 6000+ confirmed cases who have not died, are people recovering and, healthy again, going about their daily lives?  Or are they still sick, perhaps getting sicker, and perhaps eventually to be counted among the dead?"
2020-01-29 17:47,"Just to let you know, the German man from Munich probably caught the Virus from a Woman who came to his company from China to teach a group of employees. She developed Symptoms on the plane on the way back to China."
2020-01-29 18:00,"Today, the BBC news reported that in France,  there are overtly racist incidents against All Asian people. Contrast that with America, in Southern California, there is 1 incident of a carrier but no identification of which city that person is in. Perhaps this is to minimize  potential stigmatization, but this sort of leadership non victim blaming behavior is typical of American culture. At school, kids are not stigmatized / identified,  even if an anti vaccer has pertussis or recently an outbreak of strep throat. Appreciate the difference in cultural tolerance, that is why in Chinese, America is called ""beautiful country""."

2020-01-29 17:07,"Great article...but, you failed to answer questions about the virus. How is it spread...airborne? Physical contact? Food? Water?
What is the best defense? Hand washing? Masks? 
What is the incubation period? What are the first symptoms?
Please...more information. I think the CDC would know the answers. Thanks"
2020-01-29 17:10,We noticed another side effect of the New Year holiday combined with this quarantine of cities and areas in the PRC – the air is much cleaner in Seoul since industries there are idle now!
2020-01-29 17:32,"OK, let's do some math.  The population of the US is 327.2 million.  According to the CDC, on average, 5% to 20% of the population gets the flu each year.  The case mortality rate of the 2019-nCoV (CDC-ese for this virus) is about 2.1%.  If this virus were to have a transmission rate similar to that of a typical seasonal flu, this would result in anywhere from about 343,500 to 1,374,200 deaths in the US.  In one year.

For perspective, from 2010 through 2017 (the most recent year for which the CDC has finalized statistics), seasonal flu has killed an estimated 12,000 to 51,000 people per year in the US.  The (much more virulent) 1918-1919 flu is thought to have killed about 500,000 to 750,000 Americans.

Wash your hands frequently, stay home from work/school if you are sick, and try not to think about it too much."
2020-01-29 17:41,"you know the governmental health officials are gas lighting when they tout ""...even people who are infected who don’t get sick at all..."" as a good thing.

those infected people who don't get sick at all are busily transmitting the contagion like an army of Typhoid Marys because they were screened and let loose into the population.

if a virus pandemic won't kill you the pandemic of willful ignorance surely will."
2020-01-29 17:07,"Many comments here re: ascertaining relative risk from nCoV versus seasonal flu are misguided. I agree that where I live my risk of morbidity & mortality is greater from the seasonal flu because of the ""prevalence"" of it in my area.  However, fatality rates, transmission rates (think exponential fct), incubation periods, & avail. meds & vaccine to treat ARE vastly different between the two.  So if nCoV spreads rapidly in US (or mutates significantly) -it's a whole new ballgame.  See: <a href=""https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus"" target=""_blank"">https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus</a>/  for reliable stats.  Halting flights from hot zones or quarantines of incoming R ways to mitigate rapid exponential spread until treatments & testing further developed."
2020-01-29 17:43,"Yes, these kinds of viruses can have devastating consequences when bats are eaten and traded in livestock markets and when their territory is invaded. This is how the ebola virus started in Africa. The message here that doesn’t seem to be getting through is to stop hunting, eating and killing bats and just leave them alone. Of course the Chinese will eat anything that walks, crawls, flies or swims."
2020-01-29 17:11,"Apparently, a Chinese National research scientist was accused of stealing coronavirus from an infectious disease lab in Canada in July 2019. This all sounds like paranoid conspiracy theory, but Chinese agents have been caught in various research areas of academia and private industry accessing high level biotech research and development. I’m skeptical that this all started with raw snake meat."

Why isn’t USA stopping flights since they have so many cases and the disease spreads so easily, even without symptoms. It’s easier to stop before it spreads to general population."
2020-01-29 16:11,"Although this virus may be no deadlier than flu, it's a lot more prolific. There is no vaccine. No one in the United States - or anywhere else - has any immunity to it, and once it gets a toehold, it will spread quickly. As someone who is immune compromised, I would ask everyone to please wash your hands thoroughly many times a day. Please cover your cough. Please stay home if you are sick. These are basic steps we can all take to prevent this, and any other corona virus, from spreading."
2020-01-29 17:54,"Why are people comparing this coronavirus to the flu ?

2020-01-29 18:33,"I have flown into and out of Ontario International Airport many times, and lived near and had friends and family who worked at March Field, to which the evacuation flight originally slated to land at Ontario was diverted.

Ontario Intl has been a designated recipient of medical and other evacuees for going on ten years, though this would have been its first such use.

One possible reason for diverting the flight to March Field (officially known as March Air Reserve Base) is that it is much easier to control public--and media--access on a US military airfield than it is at a public airport like Ontario."
2020-01-29 18:41,"The confirmed cases will exploded in the coming days as more testing kits will be at best adequately available in China due to manufacturing limited capacity.  Thus, underreporting of infected cases is a given.  The countries in the region which are mostly poor and with inadequate health care systems should take drastic measures, due to asymptomatic infections and shortage of testing kits, to limit the spreading of the coronavirus including closing their land borders with China and halt all flights from and to China like the UK has done."
2020-01-29 18:46,"One thing I have not yet seen/heard discussed is the role that smoking has played in potentially weakening the immune systems of those who have died from the coronavirus. As someone who travels to China regularly for work, I can attest to the fact that chain smoking is widespread there. Could an already weakened respiratory and immune system be the nail in the coffin (no pun intended) for those who have died from the virus?"
2020-01-29 18:46,"Please note that face masks fill two important functions:

1. They generally reduce the number of virus particles one inhales, not by 100%, but by a meaningful amount.

2. Masks also reduce the number of virus particles expelled by infected persons when they cough or sneeze, not by 100% but by a meaningful amount. This is why you see pictures of infected patients wearing masks even in isolation wards, to reduce the chances they will infect others.

Thought for the day:  If you are sitting on a plane and your seatmate starts sneezing or coughing, put on your own mask and offer your seatmate one, too. 

Due to the coronavirus outbreak I have started carrying several masks with me when I travel in order to deal with just such eventualities.

Oh, and don't forget the personal-size hand sanitizer bottles or packets in case it is not possible to wash your hands frequently."

2020-01-29 18:29,"As long as governments and organizations consider avoiding 'public panic' and loss of tourism and other business to be more important than safeguarding the health and lives of their citizens, we will continue to respond ineffectively to this and other outbreaks of new illnesses. It is better to over react and damage your economy than to under react and risk the lives of millions. 

Strangely enough, North Korea is the only country who seems to be getting it right. They closed their borders early. Helps to be an isolated backward brutal dictatorship sometimes. If this gets worse, we might all end up wishing we were ruled by comrade Kim. More than 50 million people died during the Spanish flu."
2020-01-29 18:36,"I feel like the virus is a part of conspiracy. It is possible that it was planned to be Chinese bio weapon and then leaked from lab, or it may be a bio weapon of another country. Nevertheless, China is likely to take a huge loss in her economical and political strength."
2020-01-29 19:06,"My husband and I are retired and in our mid to late 60s. The minute the Wuhan Coronavirus hits our region we will go into voluntary quarantine so we can stay healthy and avoid obscenely expensive hospital stays during what very well may become a lengthy worldwide pandemic. We will order our groceries online and pick them up at the local supermarket once a week on Tuesdays at 2 am.

Other than that, we will stay put inside the house and avoid all contact with other people. An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure."
2020-01-29 19:30,"This is the inevitable outcome of human encroachment on nature --the Chinese merely hastened its peripheral impacts. This virus appears rather benign in its mortality rate, in its current form. I fear the day when a virus emerges that can infect 20 people for every 1 carrier and has a kill rate is 30% or higher. If we truly learn from this and act to curtail our invasion of natural space, then it may have been a worthwhile exercise. I fear it is all in vain and the inevitable will remain so."
2020-01-29 19:39,We also have to remember that viruses mutate and become stronger and harder to overcome. This needs to be contained at all costs.

2020-01-29 18:58,"Is something missing here ?

The death rate increased from 106 to 135 over the last 24 hours, so basic math indicates something like 30% more deaths in 24 hours; presuming we are getting the actual numbers.

This thing is about to get very ugly ...

I think we need to immediately declare a planet wide crises and start closing borders, unless a proven vaccine is available within the next few days.

There will be no economy anywhere, left to salvage, if this thing keeps increasing at a 30% rate."

2020-01-29 19:35,Why are our elected officials not protecting us?  The UK is setting a 14 day quarantine for individuals returning from Wuhan.  What is the US doing? 3 days quarantine in one of the most populous states in the country.  This is absurd.
2020-01-29 19:51,"More cases than SARS?  No surprise if you keep up with information.  That was predicted days ago.  It's more infectious, less lethal.  Besides staying healthy, the challenge we have is to be forever skeptical of scary headlines that are in themselves misleading written by journalists whose interest is to grab our attention and our clicks and less interested in providing a well balanced understanding. Like with current US politics, we readers are better off if we do less reading."
2020-01-29 18:58,"Imagine the global economic consequences if people suspect container ships from China are infected? 
This is an airborne virus. It gets in your eyes, your nose, etc. from a sneeze or a cough or touching something. 
We don't know how long it lives on surfaces, what the incubation period is from exposure to symptoms and we don't know if it has already mutated. 
Who knows if the Chinese government is telling all they know?
I'm carrying hand sanitizer, clorox wipes and a mini-bottle of Lysol. Better safe than sorry."
2020-01-29 19:10,"It has already been known since yesterday that Germany has four cases. All work in the same company and were probably infected by a Chinese colleague visiting a training in that company in Germany, and who only started showing symptoms on her way back. It is regarded to be an important observation that it is an early, (at the time) symptom-free case of transmission"
2020-01-29 19:51,"One aspect I'd like to see more coverage of is the apparently still lacking ability of health departments at the State and local level to test for this virus.  The technique used by most laboratories in the world currently set up for this test -RT-PCR- is readily and widely available, and the exact protocol (primer sequences etc) published.  Having to send samples to the CDC and waiting for the results puts an unnecessary restriction on larger-scale screening of possible infected individuals. If Governor Cuomo wants to show leadership, he'd make setting this test up here in New York City a priority. It would help calm people down, and help contain any outbreak around here before it takes off."
2020-01-29 20:02,So I am still keeping busy not thinking about the Coronavirus by ordering items from Amazon and eBay from China. Now I am wondering if there is any possibility of this virus being able to live on packing materials and items sent to me from China? This epidemic might be better than Trump's tariffs at getting trade surpluses down.
2020-01-29 20:04,"At this point we need a 3 week quarantine for all inbound travelers from China. Flights from China should be rerouted to military bases and travelers should be held there until they are known to be virus free. The US government should provide salary compensation and child care assistance to the people being held. After being released from quarantine travelers should carry a tracker app on  their smart phone for 6 months so that their contacts should be traced if they become sick later on.

Why 3 weeks? Our knowledge of the virus is rapidly evolving and we cannot be certain that the reported incubation time of 2 to 14 days is accurate. 3 weeks would provide a 50% safety margin over what we currently think is necessary.

Very limited exceptions to quarantine should be granted to people involved in fighting the outbreak. Being an infectious disease doctor might merit an exception. Being a billionaire with business interests in China like Sheldon Adelson would not. Secret exceptions would not be allowed under any circumstances.

The threat of virus particles on dry goods coming in from China is probably fairly low. Certain classes of imports may pose more of a threat. In the case of frozen catfish, I would be concerned that the freezing process might preserve viable virus particles. Items like blood products would be an even greater concern. Imports from China should be reviewed for contagion hazards and certain classes of imports should probably be banned."
2020-01-29 20:08,"I'm flying tomorrow, and you can be sure I'm wearing a topnotch face mask on the plane. But not in the airport, or the Lyft to the airport. I'll take clean wipes to wipe down the tray table, and maybe the bathroom door handle, but will still eat food from an airport restaurant. Partial is better than zero, and partial is better than obsession. At least, today."
2020-01-29 20:08,"I think the Western press is engaging in hysteria in its coverage of this illness. Although the Chinese have every reason to be alarmed here are the numbers for last year's flu epidemic for comparison. 42.9 million sick. 647,000 hospitalized. 61,200 dead.  Having a flue vaccine available doesn't seem to have helped much. The major problem in China seems to be an overburdened health care system as this disease seems to be treatable if people can get to care. That is not the case here. So stop scaring people who do have access to health care. Obviously we should stay out of China, that's a no brainer."
2020-01-29 20:09,"Meanwhile there have been 6,600 US deaths from the fly this year. But I guess dying from flu isn’t as sexy as “New Illness” whatever it is this year."

2020-01-29 20:32,"There are over 6,000 confirmed cases of the new coronavirus infection in China and 132 death, Most of the death if not all are from Wuhan. Within one month, every city or region have reported their cases except Tibet. This has demonstrated the highly infectious or contagious of this new virus. From the available reported data, it appears that the mortality rate for this new coronavirus is between 2-4% which is less than SARS 9-10% and MERS 30%.

There are at least 72 cases reported outside China involved almost 15 countries with no death. We would expect 1-2 death if the same mortality rate apply to this outside population. Some of the cases are from Wuhan and then passed on second or third persons which represent second or could be third wave of infection. If this trend continues to hold truth with no death, could the new coronavirus mutated and is  less virulent when it passes on from person to person ? At least, this is a hope and a thought."

If Americans feared diabetes the way they are acting about the latest strange virus on the other side of the planet, then gyms would be popping up everywhere, and Oreos/Ben and Jerry's/Coke would have gone out of business already.  

Yet, every diabetic I know is still drinking Mountain Dew while sitting on the couch complaining about the cost of insulin.  

If every American feared automobile deaths as much as they are reacting to this virus, the highways would be completely empty.  Yet, everyone sits in traffic a couple of hours a day even though its the number one killer in this country.  

People are just looking for another reason to be afraid.  Why not just rent a copy of ""The Joker"" or watch an episode of Ellen?  You stand a much better chance of a heart attack watching either than dying from Ebola, SARS, Zika, AIDS, or any host of terrifying bugs that nature throws at us."
2020-01-29 20:23,"I'm sure I don't have the exact numbers correct, but it appears to me this virus was only discovered about 10 or 12 days ago. The first couple of days there were 1000 cases. Then it quickly went to 2000 cases. Then to 6,000 cases. All this in 10 short days. if you run the math out for 1 month the numbers are astronomical. Like that game  a giving a person $0.01 the first day and doubling it every day for 30 days . People who keep comparing this to the flu are looking at total final flu numbers after the episode subsided and the virus came under control. In addition to that fact  vaccines were made available  and many people were vaccinated ahead of the flu. It could take many months before we have a vaccine for the Coronavirus. The 14-day incubation period does not help as that could mean the numbers or actual carriers could be highly    underestimated. This virus is in its early stages so it seems that to the flu cannot be carried out yet. But who cares --the stock market is booming."

2020-01-29 20:20,"What this says to Virologists like me is that the current Wuhan Corona Virus (WCV) is more virulent, invasive and infectious than the SARS corona virus. Also it has already spread within a short time to all continents except Africa and Antarctica. All observations from the SARS Corona virus are not therefore applicable to the WCV. It is misleading and irresponsible for an International expert to state that a person who is asymptomatic or symptom free is Corona virus free. Any virologist will tell you that after exposure to infection there is an incubation period during which viruses multiply without symptoms and could potentially transmit infection to a person in contact with them or are sharing the same air. Agreed that once symptoms are manifested as fever, sneezing, coughing, shortness of breath the rate of transmission will be much higher. Sensitive testing of patients suspected of exposure will be required to detect the virus during early stages of the Corona infection."
2020-01-29 20:26,"It is not panicking or being paranoid to state that the world seems to be rushing towards a public health emergency.

Two days later, it regenerated (something I’ve never heard of), with symptoms that were different and even more severe.   My face leaked fluid from my eyes and nose for days (never experienced anything like it.  It was so constantly agitating that I actually wanted to cry).  I threw up multiple times and I haven’t thrown up from illness...ever?

But, in this country, over the past 2 decades and more, our man-made epidemic--that kills at the rate of more than 150 lives per day and now accounts for more than 400,000 deaths---by opioids and other related drugs, made by our own drug companies, distributed by our manufacturers and their cohorts, systematically ignored by our federal and state health agencies---THE OPIOID EPIDEMIC is the worst man-made epidemic the world has seen, born in the USA, received scant attention if not negligible notice when people were dying at the rate of 150 people per day. No one, save a very few isolated physicians united by PROP, who believed in the medical oath of DO NO HARM, tried to stop it. We as a nation must look into our own mirror."

A few hundred thousand years ago, this coronavirus would have burned through a single small hunter-gatherer group and vanished. Even in early civilized times, the virus may have affected a small village or trading post before disappearing for lack of new hosts. Today, the virus strikes in the heart of a teeming megalopolis with hourly international flights around the world. It is not if, but when, a viral species develops into a 'perfect' infection vector: long asymptomatic period, easy airborne transmission among human hosts, and high mortality in all health subgroups. Countries like China and India, with billions of people (aka potential petri dishes) living side-by-side squalor and animal hosts, will be the source of these viral threats until public health measures change living conditions. The alternative is that Nature itself will find a biological way to curb human population, and it will not be pretty."

Also, German News showed entire cities in China quarantining themselves.  Absolutely no-one enters these cities.  They have 24/7 watchman with barriers at all entry points.

Okay, so there is a run on masks... Again, so what. That is not panicking.

There will always be a small group of people who will go out and stock-up on items, which is a human thing... not a panicking thing! 

What is frustrating is the fact that we have officials who think that they should withhold information so as not to create a panic... which is what the Chinese government did when the Wuhan Pneumonia Virus first appeared.  

When a hurricane threatens, people go to the store and stock up... that isn't panicking.  Think about it, people who live in earthquake prone zones and take the time to stock up are not panicking.   People who build a tornado shelter and plan ahead... are not panicking.

China reports that the virus can be spread by people who show no symptoms.  China also insists that people from the Wuhan area quarantine themselves for 2 weeks.  

Australia is flying their citizens to Christmas Island, 1,200 miles away from the mainland, for a 2 week quarantine.  Everybody is saying ""2 week quarantine"" but when it comes to our diplomats... they're special and only need 72 hours!

Keep in mind, our experts have been working on a vaccine for the MERS virus for years... so far... nothing.  NADA.  No vaccine!

How's that AIDS vaccine doing?  How's the vaccine for the common cold doing?  How effective is the yearly flu vaccine?

2020-01-30 1:41,"Novel coronavirus death rate assessment

If you divide the current confirmed deaths by the current confirmed case number you get

170 / 7771 = 2.2% death rate

However, this assumes that the 170 deaths all occurred today

A more accurate death rate needs to reflect that the deaths occur after a period of illness...that the 170 deaths we now see were of people who became ill a few days ago.

If you assume that most deaths are occurring after 4 days of illness, you need to use the confirmed cases number of 4 days age which is 2700 so the math becomes

170 / 2700 = 6.3% death rate

If the illness period  before death is more than 4 days, the death rate goes higher because the denominator gets smaller.

The US death rate for the common flu is very low even though we see between 12,000 to 61,000 influenza related deaths every year...it is just that the denominator of flu illnesses is huge as in 9 million to 45 million cases

The bottom line...this new coronavirus has a meaningfully higher death rate"

2020-01-30 3:10,"Folks, there have been a lot of good comments today, which have given me more to think about.

First, one of the Chinese Health Officials referred to this problem as the Coronavirus Pneumonia, which is why I call it the Wuhan Pneumonia Virus.   This might be a better description of how a percentage of people are dying!

Second, first recorded case was Dec 1st, 2019 and I suspect that it was going at least a few weeks earlier than that, if not a month.  Chinese officials worked very hard suppressing the outbreak for almost the entire month of December.

Third: All parts/regions of China are now reporting cases of the Wuhan Pneumonia Virus.  This would indicate that the historical mass quarantine has only slowed the spread and not stopped it.

Fourth:  Having the virus in the US, UK, France, Germany or Australia isn't as scary to me as having it in India, Bangladesh or Africa.  If the Wuhan Pneumonia Virus gets going in those areas, then I would say, ""We have a major problem!""

Fifth:  The only people panicking are the media and Governments.  The public is doing just fine and I don't see people panicking.  Yes there are runs on face masks.  You will always have a small group who prepares at the first sign of trouble.

Sixth:  There is a saying, the public is about 3 days from panicking (I give it 7 days) - When you see a run on the grocery stores, then you will understand what I am saying.

My advice, get your vaccinations, including the pneumonia shot, wash your hands often!"

So many Han Chinese are fully intwined in Caucasian families and Caucasians love Han Chinese in families and social settings, such nonsense is unthinkable.  I dearly love and have loved my Han Chinese friends, male and female.  There are millions of loving Chinese-American couples in America and around the world.

Potentially exposing all those random people on their flights, and all then all the people the people on their flights come in contact with, and on and on? This is a novel virus which we know very little about. Are they so sure the they will be able to conduct lab tests that rule out the coronavirus in three days?

China’s proof of its failure of governance and incompetence is the Wuhan coronavirus (after the CCP received years of credible warnings from its own scientists after the SARS and MERS pandemics). Negligence kills people.  

While it condemns America to its people, it is American scientists, not Chinese scientists that just developed a vaccine against African Swine Fever Virus that has killed off a huge part of China’s livestock supply, threatening its national food security.

It is also reasonable to expect that America’s or Australia’s or another democracy’s scientists will soon find a cure or vaccine for China’s corona virus.  Yet the communist leadership will continue to gaslight with propaganda worldwide against liberal western democracies.  It has used its power to exclude Taiwan from the World Health Organization (WHO).

Under these circumstances the best defense will be to broadcast the truth to the world AND to the Chinese people that it was America than developed a vaccine for African swine flu.  

And when a cure is found for the Wuhan coronavirus, it must be clear to every backward rural Chinese peasant, that while China started the deadly virus, it was liberal Western democracies that found the cure."

""Coronavirus Live Updates: China Now Has More Cases Than It Had of SARS.""

Wouldn't you expect better reporting nearly 20 years after a major outbreak? Did IQs suddenly drop since SARS has been away? We should be alarmed when China reports lower than expected infection rates. Higher numbers suggest an improvement in competency and transparency.

By the same token, lower death rates per infection aren't a bad thing. We would expect healthcare outcomes to improve over 20 years. We want lower death-to-infection ratios. We are only concerned if China is obscuring the true cause of death or failing to report deaths at all.

The question isn't whether the numbers are alarming. They aren't. The question is how much do we trust these numbers compared to anything we can compare these numbers against. That's the uncertainty we're grappling with."

There is some controversy as to whether they can be contagious during the incubation period. How long before they test positive for the virus if they have been exposed/are a carrier? So much Is still unknown.
2020-01-30 4:44,"China has more reported cases.  Reporting and testing facilities and behavior have changed radically since 2003.  I've been in China during both outbreaks, there is no comparison to the degree of precautions and public/private intervention during the two events."
2020-01-30 4:18,"This nasty virus is clever.
Its predominant characteristic is the ease at which it is spread. 

Better for a virus bent on domination to cause fatalities in lets say 10 percent of cases if it can spread to 50% of the population. 

We need to focus upon containment. Urgently. No time for political correctness. Just good old fashioned quarantine."
2020-01-30 5:32,"Interesting about the Americans evacuated from China being quarantined on an airbase in California.  Sounds like a very prudent course of action, and hopefully one not opposed by civil libertarian zealots.  It was,  of course, the discharge of infected soldiers returning from Europe in 1918 from an army base in Maine that incubated the domestic Spanish Flu epidemic which subsequently killed 675,000 Americans."
2020-01-30 5:42,"Noting that there were 2 coronavirus positive but asymptomatic Japanese citizens among the 200 airlifted from Wuhan to Japan, we might estimate that approximately 2% of all people in Wuhan are currently coronavirus positive but asymptomatic.

If so (and it's of course quite a brave extrapolation) then Wunan may have 200,000 currently asymptomatic but infected. 

The published deaths at around 350 at time of writing would represent a rather low mortality rate in that case - though deaths may have been misattributed and will lag behind infection rates."
2020-01-29 18:01,"The most terrifying is the German man and the Japanese bus driver. Seriously, what are the odds, unless there is rampant infection and many asymptomatic carriers? Super sick people don't attend conferences or go on bus tours. There must be many times more infected people than on the official tallies. This thing is likely to explode in a couple of weeks as there must be many many people walking around infected without knowing it. And then we can expect the death rate to rise. There is no treatment. only supportive care while the host fights the virus. Unfortunately, supportive care takes a lot of resources and if we get an explosion of sick people, care facilities will be quickly overwhelmed."
2020-01-30 6:24,"How fast is the infection rate doubling and how fast is the death rate doubling? A graph would be helpful. I have heard unconfirmed reports that the death rate is about 2% of the infection rate.

It seems that we are well past possibly containing this. The question is, have we been effective at slowing the spread."
2020-01-30 7:27,"I live in China. I went to get more N95 masks today but the local pharmacy was shuttered. I was stocking up on water and was coming back to a huge apartment complex. The streets of the immense city I live in are largely deserted. All the restaurants are closed - only a few convenience stores are open. 

Since yesterday, there is only one way into my complex (which has eight connected towers of thirty stories). 

Through that one entrance there are now two cops (usually there was just one). You must get tested with an electronic thermometer before they let you in. They put it to your forehead and it takes about 3 seconds and there is a beep.

Today was really scary because I was carrying a lot of water and vegetables and I must have been flushed - the cop hesitated after the first beep of the thermometer. After a second check he waved me through. Whew!

It's a very eerie, creepy situation. I wash my hands a lot of stay home as best I can."
2020-01-30 7:42,"Medical,dental, and aesthetic staff all - Please stop wearing your scrubs and work clothes on public transit and if you go out for coffee or meals.Clinics, hospitals,etc. should mandate this common sense practice. Thank you."
2020-01-30 5:34,"China should teach all of their citizens the importance of washing their hands with soap after restroom use, with food prep, etc., a basic public health principle that lowers the spread of disease which they do not seem to practice, at least not when I visited a few years ago. They did not provide soap in their restrooms except in Beijing and Shanghai."
2020-01-30 6:46,"Given that their were 2 cases of asymptomatic Japanese persons on the the evacuation flight, could we say that there is a chance the US will have 2 cases on its repatriation flight that came into the military base today?  As I understand they have been checked, will continue to be checked and quarantined for 3 days at the base and will then be released to travel home and self quarantine for 14 days...not sure how prudent it is to allow returning people on flights with hundreds of others after only being quarantined for 3 days.  Sounds like a recipe for disaster.  I would at least like to know what airports and flights they are on so I have a choice and stay as far away as I can.  Some European countries are initially quarantining for 14 days."
2020-01-30 6:17,British Airways has taken the lead and stopped all flights from China.  Why haven't the American airlines followed suit?  Is it always about the money?  Delta and United need to Stop now.  It is a huge risk and Americans will likely die over it.
2020-01-30 10:31,What is not discussed much is what is happening in the countries without strong surveillance systems. It is probably not a coincidence that no case is reported from Africa. Given the number of Chinese in the contingent (millions) it is not very likely that there is no case. A stark contrast with countries that follow every probably case and have identified infected among non symptomatic evacuees (and can provide good health care) like Japan. We need to worry much the spread in the countries from where we are not hearing anything.
2020-01-29 18:03,"This, I believe, is evolving into a global catastrophic event. National security professionals need to take proactive and decisive action now. Technocratic policy choices of the past will not suffice. Before the virus emerges and evolves in the interior, shut down all ports of entry, implement wide area surveillance technology, and mobilize every hospital, state agency and research institution to prepare for the worst case scenario. Don't wait for the WHO, our sovereignty is at stake."
2020-01-28 12:11,"About 100 people have died in China as a result of corona virus. China has about 1.5 billion people. I would imagine that more people, during the same period of time, have died as a result of the flu.

Cover your mouth when you cough and sneeze.
Stay home and consult a physician if you don't feel well.

This is the first time in at least 20 years of my having an annual flu shot, that I’ve actually caught influenza. My doctor says it’s just an epidemic this year, and the shot is much less effective than in prior years."

Containment is not just the best way:  it is the only way."
2020-01-28 14:59,"These epidemics are really scary-- especially those that are brand new, meaning we have little to no natural immunity to them. I think it's completely reasonable during an outbreak to limit travel and to work toward containment. Our immune systems were not created for this extraordinarily global world we live in. See: getting sick after taking an airplane flight. We have immunity to the pathogens in our immediate area-- not to everything. We need to adapt our world again for this new moment where, as scientists will tell you, such diseases are only going to arise more often, be more severe, and spread more quickly."
2020-01-28 14:55,"1 more prong in what I would advocate as a multi pronged approach to stem the tide of spread of Wuhan Corona Virus (WCV). The economies of PRC and HK will be hurt but anything in the interest of global public health is better than just panic. Right now with no vaccine and no proven antiviral against WCV, I think the race to beat the march of the virus across countries and continents has to be won by all means possible including quarantines and stopping the flow of travelers across national boundaries. There are reports that some persons who may not have had any known contacts with infected persons were found to be positive, presumably not false positive. 

A slight high temperature as a gold standard for grounds for quarantine or isolation may not be adequate to say that the person is infected with WCV. A quick sensitive and specific diagnostic assay should be widely distributed. I remember crossing across the HK- China border twice by road in the last 2 decades. During my last visit when temperature monitors by border personnel were intimidating for what they would have done to me if I was found with high temperature. I popped a Tylenol pill an hour before the border crossing, just in case a temperature gun shot a beam that mistakenly detected some temperature abnormality different from what they were trying to stop me from crossing the border. 

All needs to be done to enable infected or exposed persons win their race against rapidly spreading WCV in their lung tissue."

The stock market went crazy yesterday because investors don't like uncertainty and a worldwide virus would affect sales of many products, thus people's investments.

Like the American embrace of a gun culture that occasionally results in mass shootings and drives continuous - if sporadically reported - gun violence, China appears to regard these occasional outbreaks as a frictional cost of obeisance to a more insidious cultural disease.  And like America, the world's largest seller and black market distributor of arms and ammunition of all dimension, the Chinese export some of the damage from their social derangement.  Odd parallels.  Will these malignant behaviors be addressed in future trade agreements between the superpowers?"

So, maybe the virus will slow consumption down enough to make the world managers take more penetrating look at what is happening with climate.

Viruses that spread person to person have a epi curve that   has successively large peaks. This is due to one person spreading it to x amount then those spreading it to even more ppl etc. I'd expect a propagated epi curve just based on the information. 

There's also been reports on R0 which roughly translates to the amount of secondary cases that will happen from one infected person.

Because we live in a global society with global markets, a new illness could be devastating not because it kills a lot of people, but because it causes major economic upheaval, which (as people blame each other) could then lead to major political upheaval.

Also announcements  could be made in public places, trains, buses and planes to ask people to cover a cough or sneeze with their inner elbow or a tissue. Hand sanitizers and tissues and maybe cough drops could be made available as well. One person with an unprotected sneeze or repeated cough could contaminate a plane, train car, bus or office and if they sneeze into their hands and then touch a tray table, handrail, supermarket or bank touch screen then those surfaces could be contaminated as well, then the next person who touches the screen or handrail and then their eyes, nose or mouth could be infected as well.

2020-01-28 16:49,"This is the second major viral outbreak in China in the past one year.

Totally overlooked is the fact that nearly a quarter-BILLION pigs -- representing one-quarter of the entire global population -- were recently slaughtered due to an out-of-control African Swine Flu pandemic. 

As a direct consequence, the country has been facing serious meat supply-chain shortages, along with price spikes of available pork supplies.

That is what led to recent increases in consumption of alternate meat sources - possibly sourced from a new population or species due to market demand.

Either way, the underlying causal mechanism was a catastrophic animal disease outbreak leading to a secondary human disease outbreak. 

And increased risk of outbreaks caused by livestock and crop pathogens is precisely what scientists predicted will occur when ecosystems are disrupted due to environmental damage or... yes, once again... climate change."

And people from Beijing to Shanghai to Guangzhou are practicing ""self-quarantine"". This will continue after the Lunar Holiday.  How exactly is a nation under these conditions to function?

To contain human-spread - contact and/or sneeze-transmissible - diseases, quarantines should be imposed promptly. 

Cutting-off all flights from China is disruptive. But this is the best way to contain this new virus. 

Further, anyone with a passport stamp showing they've been in China since, say, 1 December 2019, should be quarantined, unless they have been out of China for at least a fortnight. This should ensure that only those, who have recently left China - and may be carrying the virus - are quarantined. 

When ebola erupted in West Africa in 2014, there was no shut-down of flights from Liberia, Sierra Leone, and Guinea. That was error. Most residents can't afford any airline ticket: only the wealthy - a tiny minority - would have been affected. Road travel in the region is only for the brave.

An air traveler from Monrovia (Liberia) arrived in Lagos (Nigeria) and collapsed in the airport. He was at once hospitalized. He soon died. By quickly finding those, who had had contact with him, the Nigerians kept ebola from spreading.

Quarantines are disruptive and so costly. But there's no better way to contain sneeze-transmissible, human-spread diseases. 

Equally, diseases spread by birds or winged insects can't be contained, so quarantines of humans are futile."

I remember when China hosted the Olympics in 2008 and the torch came through San Francisco. There were so many protesters in the city to express their views against China's many outrageous policies from human rights violations to Tibet to name a few. The route of the Olympic torch was supposed to be along the Embarcadero and families from around the Bay Area had gathered to watch the historic event.

Unfortunately Gavin Newsom, mayor at the time, made a backroom closed door deal with the Chinese so that the route was changed at the last minute and kept secret. This all so that China good avoid the embarrassment of visual photos and videos of protesters like those from London and elsewhere. The route ended up going down Van Ness Avenue instead, and China got its pretty pictures and videos of the torch in SF sans protesters. I was down at the Embarcadero and watched as disappointed children and their parents returned to their cars and hours-long drives home in traffic having been disappointed by the collusion between Newsom and the Chinese. 

It's all about pretty pictures and presentation to China. So I'm sure if what we're seeing is bad, the reality is so much worse."

There is zero irony even though dangerous conditions are explained weekly or daily in the news regarding antibiotic microbial resistance or that 30% of all hospital deaths are secondary to sepsis (classically as a result of a bloodborne infection).  The public forgets that China slaughtered 1/2 of their pigs due to a virus screaming through the farms.  This particular virus, Coronavirus, is likewise of zoonotic origin and cross species contagious. The world needs to stop building mechanism of war and spend that munitions money on infectious disease or expect a pandemic of epic proportions heretofore unthinkable in numbers of untimely deaths."
2020-01-28 19:08,"Are they using the SIR disease model or the SIS disease model? How much historical data do we have on the origin of common cold viruses? I suspect all common colds start with higher fatality rates and then mutate to keep their hosts alive longer in order to spread farther. Why was the 1918 flu the exception in becoming more lethal?

Assume there are two strains that are nearly identical but one outcompetes the other by keeping more hosts alive with mild symptoms not requiring an ER and quarantine. The better virus would burn through the population faster than the lethal strain that is killing its host and being quarantined. One strain is more fit to spread. I would assume the hosts temporary immunity from the better more fit virus drops the susceptible population left for the lethal strain to infect to zero.

Do they know if it is the exact same virus in people who are hospitalized that is infecting people who are not hospitalized? If a more fit and less lethal virus is found then it might be better to lift the quarantine before the less lethal strain burns out. The first and more lethal strain always escapes before there is a total quarantine."

I might even suggest cooking all veggies in the meantime and forget about raw salads for a while.

Even when taking in packages and deliveries from Amazon or whoever, wear gloves, that box has passed through many hands en route to you.
Even the USPS workers wear gloves, so it’s not so silly after all.

2020-01-28 19:59,"Unfortunately, testing at ports of entry, even if they are using virus test kits, is an incomplete approach. If the virus spreads between passengers on the plane, not an unlikely event based on what we know,  passengers infected on the plane may not yet have sufficient virus in their blood to test positive. 

So in this critical period, the US and other countries are taking only half-measures to prevent the spread of the virus, presumably in the name of minimizing disruption to the normal flow of business. But if the virus takes hold here, it's likely that disruption to business will be much greater, to say nothing of the human impact."

This question is far from academic: If these new cases are mostly newly infected patients, then this new corona virus is quite virulent and spreads quickly.  If the increase in numbers is mainly due to better ability to properly diagnose the patients, it's still serious, but not spreading like wildfire. The first scenario can require aggressive containment, including preemptive quarantine also here in the US, the latter a much less restrictive approach. Thanks!"

2. understand that for most people this is a self-limiting and miserable, but not lethal or dangerous virus.   That is part of why it is spreading so fast - it isn't debilitating for most people.
3. Think about where you work or go to school or live.  Are parents harassed by administrators about school absences? Are workers able to take time off to recover?  Are people forced to come in sick to work?  Are teachers allowed to have sick time without harassment or peer pressure?  Start working on those issues and your community will be more resilient."

But I've heard of accounts of people flying from China to NY and the West Coast in the last couple of days with no check at all, not even questions about where they are originating from?! The U.S. response to this is a bit head scratching. Banning all flights from China is not realistic, but there should be self imposed 14 day quarantine for all travelers from China at this point, and promise of fines for those who break quarantine and end up affecting others."
2020-01-28 21:48,"It's good that airport screening has started. Better late than never!! Theoretically, it is less effective than to start say, last week, because by now, an innumerable number of people who are infected with the virus without symptoms have already left China and already arrived in the US. incubation period is about 2 weeks anyways. Effort is delayed given how the number of symptomatic cases grow exponentially but the effort is better than none. Government funding and action are needed in situations like this. and when this is over, funding is needed to prevent future outbreaks by funding the study of animal-derived viruses--think of how much of the global economy is saved with a few million dollars."

2020-01-28 22:34,"If Republicans need an example of why blind loyalty to a dictator is dangerous, this is it. I mean, I would’ve thought Chernobyl was a good enough example, but here we are...

You see, the best and the brightest don’t like to work for governments or companies that dictate what they have to say or how they have to act. Because that stifles innovation. It also undercuts the mission. When a government or a company places a higher demand on partisan loyalty than they do on pursuit of innovation, facts, and improving the public welfare, then they end up with a whole bunch of mediocre yes men who don’t know how to respond to an emergency.

The best and the brightest, truly, would have already been all over this. They’d have immediately assembled emergency international communicable disease response teams, and set up transparent networks for information dissemination in the early stages, when the virus first presented.

But because China placed a higher value on its political appearance, it tried to suppress facts and reality, and now their country is in crisis. It’s the perfect allegory for climate change, industrial pollution, and political corruption in the United States. Trump has never had to face a true crisis. I pray to thousands of higher powers that day will never come. Because if you want to know how he would respond: look at China."

2020-01-28 22:01,"I found it regrettable that NYT came up with a title of ""Cases Up Nearly 60%"". This type of eye-catching sensational titles does not reflect true journalism. Any medical professional will tell you that the confirmed cases are not true cases. They are what they are -- confirmed cases. Many factors contribute to the total number of confirmed cases, such as availability of test kits and medical professionals who can conduct these tests. 

There is no need to stir public hysteria. I have much higher expectation for the Times than this."

2020-01-28 21:41,"Several days ago I commented on the existence of a bio weapons research facility in Wuhan. Maybe it’s just a “coincidence “ but I don’t like “coincidences “. The WAPO is now reporting on this and how many now suspect this virus did not originate in the market as was claimed and that the timeline for the outbreak is off. I’d love it if the NYT would put some effort into this. I think this is important as if it’s a bio weapon that got “loose”, this is important to know."
2020-01-28 21:50,The US should deny landing rights to all planes where the flight otriginated in China.
2020-01-28 23:16,"It is misleading and irresponsible for an International expert to state that a person who is asymptomatic or symptom free is Corona virus free. Any virologist will tell you that after exposure to infection there is an incubation period during which viruses multiply without symptoms and could potentially transmit infection to a person in contact with them or are sharing the same air. Agreed that once symptoms are manifested as fever, sneezing, coughing, shortness of breath the rate of transmission will be much higher. Sensitive testing of patients suspected of exposure will be required to detect the virus during early stages of the Corona infection."
2020-01-28 23:10,"Another brilliant plan to close the barn door after the horses have the left the barn.  If the incubation for infection is up to 14 days and people are contagious while clinically symptomatic, then airport screening is totally useless  as one person without symptoms could infect 2 or 3 people on a flight who could then travel onto other destinations and infect 2 to 3 people and by the time the original traveler becomes acutely ill, literally hundreds of people will be contagious but asymptomatic.    What we have here is a version of the  Dark Winter war game run from June 22-23, 2001, by the Center for Strategic and International Studies, the Johns Hopkins Center for Civilian Biodefense Studies, the ANSER Institute for Homeland Security, and the Oklahoma City National Memorial Institute for the Prevention Terrorism.   The result of that war game and every wargame involving the threat of biological agents and pandemic risk is that prevention fails and contagion spreads faster than governments can comprehend and react to the risk.  Only AI could recognize and stop contagion fast enough to prevent a worst case global pandemic which is what we are witnessing in slow motion.   No nation is prepared for this and no nation will be able to cope with the disaster once containment fails (and it already has failed)."
2020-01-28 22:59,"If this virus can be present WITHOUT symptoms for up to two weeks how does screening for symptoms work?

Other reports have noted that Wuhan is the location of a level 4 containment lab - a place where work is done using highly contagious viruses.   

China has has outbreaks occurring elsewhere when samples escaped from other labs.

If this virus IS the product of bioengineering - as part of work creating a bioweapon - then things are going to get a lot worse.   The long asymptomatic period would be highly advantageous in a bioweapon - giving it time to travel without any symptoms showing.   The reported R0 rate is reported by a researcher in Britain to be higher than reported as well.

There are also many reports out of China that cause of death is not being accurately reported in many deaths and the number of sick is vastly under reported."
2020-01-28 16:01,"Query. Who is exerting pressure on the World Health Organization to downplay this growing global health crisis? If the global risk assessment for the coronavirus is now deemed to be “high,” why hasn’t the response from WHO escalated accordingly?"
2020-01-28 18:13,"I don't believe a word China says about the number of cases, screening, protective measures, or anything else.  Until they clean up their agricultural habits and the way they treat livestock and wild animals, such diseases will continue to arise on their soil.  And we all know that's not going to happen."
2020-01-28 17:26,"Mixing politics and authoritarianism with epidemiological practices in assesssing and controlling the extent of potentially global disease pandemics is a recipe for disaster. That is to say, health agencies all over the world like the CDC, WHO and the CCDC can be overly influenced when politicians think that the disease control recommendations are unfavorable to the respective politicians in power."
2020-01-28 17:46,"China has supposedly and finally banned the sale of wild animals, but it's too late in this case. You would think they would have learned, after the same thing happened with SARS. And we're letting people in China fly here, before they're superficially checked for the virus. If a bus driver caught it from tourists, what about the long flights from China to California? Better get ready for this one, folks. Let's hope it doesn't mutate slightly, like we've seen with influenza."
2020-01-28 21:16,No one knows yet if the virus can be transmitted prior to symptoms such as fever occur.  No one really trusts the Chinese government on reporting the extent of the outbreak .  We should quarantine anyone arriving in this country from China.  People are very scared for good reason.

2020-01-28 23:50,"Yes, new viruses can be frightening, mainly because of the potential for mutation.  At the moment this virus has not mutated and its infection/mortality rate is far less than the common flu.  On average 60,000-80,000 people die in the USA from the common flu......wait...wait.  I know what you’ll say next, ‘but there have been so many cases in such a short amount of time’....ok, 4,500  confirmed cases, but hey maybe the government is lying, so lets say it is 45,000 since December. Sound fair?  Ok.  Great.  Globally there are between 3 to 5 million severe cases of  common flu per year....most falling within a 22-week period.  Now, I am not great at math but hmmmm.....given that happens yearly I can kind of see why the WHO and other health organizations are trying to calm the panic of irrational adults in places like New York that, statistically, have a greater chance of dying from chronic constipation than the novel coronavirus."

Unless the NIH and CDC get their collective acts together, there will come a day when one of these viral and bacterial horrors will mutate into something on par with HIV, or maybe even worse, although I can’t imagine anything worse at the moment than HIV, but temperamental Mother Nature has a way of going dark side like a proverbial woman scorned."
2020-01-29 1:36,"We have treatments and vaccination for the flu today. When we didn't (1918 flu pandemic) 30% of the world population was infected and 10% of them died. That was 50 million dead, 500 million infected out of a population of 1.8 billion. A global pandemic, likely to come from a form of coronavirus, which spreads easily person to person, could kill five times that today. That would be 2.5 billion infected and 250 million dead."

2020-01-28 20:29,"Airport screenings are just for show and essentially worthless. 

We should days ago already have begun total ban of EVERY non-citizens from entering the US if they have been in China anytime during the prior 30 days (returning Americans should be required to enter strict quarantine for 15 days).  

If this Chinese disease spreads in substantial numbers around the world, then the ban should be extended to stop EVERY non-US citizen from entering the US whether they have been to China or not."
2020-01-29 1:59,"My understanding is that Chinese espionage agents stole the coronavirus from a Winnipeg, Canada lab in 2016 and the virus later leaked from the Wuhan bio-terror facility due to its highly engineered virility.  All the snake and bat soup live animal market talk is a muddled back story.  Xi knows it’s serious and China is at risk.  US legislators and the bureaucratic ruling classes appear to be catching up quickly."
2020-01-29 2:06,Am I supposed to get upset about this? China has a billion and a half people. 130 died of corona virus. I would imagine that over the same period more people than that died of the flu.

2020-01-29 2:44,"So, it’s on every continent and everyone is worried about people traveling from China. Hate to break it to you, but now you have to keep everyone from entering the US. Also, the asymptomatic first two weeks means checking passengers’ temperature is meaningless. It will be everywhere very soon."
2020-01-29 2:49,"It's not the total number of deaths reported (now at about 150) but the rate of infection and death that are alarming to health officials. Projections based on the current spread of 2019-nCoV
are very sobering indeed. Health authorities need to treat any arrivals from mainland China with compassionate caution. Limited quarantines seem within reason.
Johns Hopkins has an online coronavirus dashboard that is being updated continuously."
2020-01-29 3:02,"I think precaution is warranted, and it’s extremely tragic that over 100 people have died from this disease. However, everything that I’ve read indicates that the people that have died from this tend to be the same groups that are also more likely to die from other diseases like the flu. When a virus comes along that is fatal for young, healthy people I’ll worry more. When that happens, everyone is in big trouble because that means even the healthiest people can’t fight it off. So far, that doesn’t seem to be the case here."
2020-01-29 2:53,"Let’s hope one of these experts convinces Chinese officials to ban once a for all the sale of live animals (bears and, yes, even dogs) adjacent to butchered meat. The causal connection between such practices and these outbreaks is beyond coincidence."
2020-01-29 3:01,"The most disturbing number on the Johns Hopkins tracker is the ratio of deaths to ""recovered"", whatever that means. It's currently 131/107. We don't have a number for the time between presumed infection and death for those who died."

My friend who was warned that it could be the case. Documents were not released yet as far as I know nor have been told to media. I myself have a poor immune system and is highly susceptible to getting sick as it is. If cases pop up here, it will go everywhere."
2020-01-29 3:43,I guess this is another reason for the United to have open borders¿
2020-01-29 4:40,"The Australian government has totally dropped the ball on this. Our summer holidays are ending and children are due back to school.  The education department is only telling students with confirmed cases of coronavirus or those who have been in contact with confirmed cases not to go to school. Well excuse me but there are loads of ways a person might have the virus but not be a confirmed case: they don’t go to a doctor, testing takes time, and doctor’s may not pick it up (there have already been such cases).  Also, the incubation period is 14 days and a person might spread it during that time without having symptoms.  There’s still a lot unknown about this deadly virus. Also, children’s immune systems are not as strong as healthy adults. It would be reasonable to ask all students who have flown in from China to stay away from school for the incubation period. Some top private schools have gone against the government.  The government is hiding behind its so-called medical experts. But, what’s really driving this decision?  Not offending China, is more important than protecting our kids."
2020-01-29 3:44,"The WHO does not seem to be publishing any of the usual statistics of sex, age and info on preexisting health conditions of the people who have died of this virus on their situation reports. They have done this for every other outbreak- why not this one? 

This lack of information and their strangely subdued response seems very out of sync with the photographs of masked hysteria coming from Wuhan. 

I am really hoping that this is not a “Gee, we probably should have...” moment in the making."
2020-01-29 9:25,"Actual numbers help keep perspective on these things.  If the numbers coming out of China are correct, the corona virus is killing about 2% of the diagnosed cases.  The 1918 influenza pandemic infected about 500 million and killed 20-50 million, 4-10% of the cases.   The SARS outbreak killed 9.6% of the diagnosed cases. For comparison the annual flu in the US currently kills about 0.13 % of the cases."
2020-01-29 7:59,"I doubt that China - or any government - wants the world to believe that this outbreak is anything but a naturally occurring 'cross over' at a live animal market but that is looking to be more and more unlikely.

Information has been published linking the Wuhan Institute of Virology  - a level 4 biohazard containment lab opened in 2017 - to research studying some of the world's most dangerous pathogens.

In November the institute posted that it was seeking to hire one or two post-doc fellows, who will use ""bats to research the molecular mechanism that allows Ebola and SARS-associated coronaviruses to lie dormant for a long time without causing diseases.""


This is a job posting for the lab of Dr. Peng Zhou, Ph.D., a leader of the Bat Virus Infection and Immunization Group  at the WUhan Institute.

It appears that China was conducting research specifically focused on the type of virus at large and on the mechanisms in bats which allowed them to carry virulent viruses without showing symptoms.

More information can be found via a search on the person noted above.   Too much information is available to dismiss this report out of hand."
2020-01-29 6:49,"Well, according to The NY Times, “they” have thankfully apparently figured out  formula/code/whatever of the  corona virus, so can we expect a vaccine in about a year, or hopefully much sooner?

There are reportedly two or three companies working on the vaccine, and there is some collaboration apparently

Knock on wood, let’s not “jinx” anything, because luck is surely needed 

I read on the internet business Global News service reports that Geovax, Atlanta, is apparently working with a
Wuhan lab/company

I’m sure there is much going on, most of which I am not equipped

And Ebola has not been extinguished"
2020-01-29 3:36,"Wash your hands frequently and Lysol all high-touch surfaces, as with flu season prevention. 

This may sound rude, but another helpful trick is that if someone coughs on you, tell them they’re disgusting and need to learn better hygiene. We underestimate the value of calling people out for gross behavior. I used to work in an elementary school, one of the germiest places on the planet, and calling out bad hygiene was very effective during flu season. People need to realize that we each play a role in preventing the spread of infectious disease. 

If elementary kids can understand it, so can adults. And it’s not being “OCD” to sanitize surfaces before touching them, or to use a wet wipe on your face and hands if someone coughs on or near you. It’s common sense."
2020-01-29 14:39,"All the infected cases were people who have traveled to Wuhan in January. What about the people who traveled there in December when infections of the virus had already started but not yet publicly known? If the incubation period is said to be two weeks, seriously, where were all those travelers in December? Did none of them get infected, or....? This is the flu season in United States, how do we know if the corona-virus infections/deaths were hidden as regular flu?"
2020-01-29 15:29,"I think it is wise that Chinese authorities are accepting help from international experts to control the ongoing virus. It is scary to know that many people are fleeing and trying to keep themselves safe, but at the same time, risking others health. I am relieved to know that many countries are being extremely cautious when it comes to travelers coming in and out. I hope this virus gets controlled and no more people have to die. Very scary time to be alive."
2020-01-29 14:44,"In just the past two decades, we have three viral pandemic originating from China, specifically from Chinese's penchant for wild animals. When will the Chinese people take stock on this fact? When will their government? Or globally, the Chinese people's love for wild animals might just be the death of us."
2020-01-27 16:58,"The Chinese government cannot have it both ways.  If they put themselves as only authority on caring for the people, then they carry the burden for every failing.  Without a free press and a desire for the truth, government and politicians will always choose to cover-up embarrassing events because they can.  It is just a matter of time before some event become so big and so critical that they cannot contain it.  China likes to blame foreigners (particularly the West) for domestic troubles.  This is something that is entirely self-inflicted.  Thus, there is no one to blame but themselves."
2020-01-27 16:55,"xi the pooh bear and his and his party-cult's insecurity are why we even have an outbreak in the first place.  Instead of fighting live- and endangered-animal butchery and being honest from the start, he looks away and muffles those who speak truth to power-hunger.  A regime so corrupted by its lust for control has no place ""fighting corruption"" or outbreaks, there as here.

With no coup in sight, I hope the virus is indeed ""fair"" to them."
2020-01-27 17:11,"The truth can only stay buried for so long. The CCP's repressive and inhumane censorship of information of vital public interest is hamstringing disease control efforts and leaving the people of China without the ability to make accurate risk assessments, putting millions at risk."
2020-01-27 17:27,"Looks like the ruling party in China deserves criticism. They’ve invested heavily in technology to spy on people, built up a massive system of “social credit scores” but public safety? They seem to be able to invest in everything except public safety. 

Let’s not make that mistake. Let’s actually make plans with safety and sustainability in mind."
2020-01-27 17:39,"The thought of this virus spreading through the states is very concerning.  Unlike China, the U.S. can't quarantine whole cities or regions.  The U.S. could temporarily ban travel between China and the U.S., but it seems the genie is already out of the bottle and spreading around the world.  So, the only real way to address the larger situation is to find an effective antiviral or vaccine which will probably take several years.  Until then, we seem to be stuck with isolating individuals suspected of having the disease and treating the symptoms as best we can.  Perhaps, like other viruses, the death rate will be low and limited to individuals who have weak immune systems."
2020-01-27 17:53,"Meanwhile, as I look at every product around my home that is manufactured in China, not by a Chinese company but by an American company whose CEO chose to move production facilities to China to lower production costs and accelerate his stock price and salary, how will this effect my lifestyle...?"
2020-01-27 17:55,The government should tell its citizens it’s time to join the rest of us by ending the consumption of LIVE and often endangered animals. Honestly serves them right.

2020-01-27 17:57,"The source of this outbreak (and of others previously) appears to be unregulated markets and butchers. Apparently anything goes in these places. So when the GOP whines about how inconvenient regulations are to America's business interests, remember what it's like when you don't have any. Regulations usually come into being because businesses cannot be trusted to do the right thing. See ""Love Canal""."
2020-01-27 18:13,Good to see the narrative of a complete consensus in the Chinese public falls apart upon closer inspection.   People still have the expressive creativity to bypass oppressive censorship and hopefully always will.
2020-01-27 18:16,"President Xi rise to power mostly because its people trust him at the time to bring growth to its economy. But this virus will really test him in showing transparency to dangerous conditions endured by his own citizens. Any cover ups will strongly shield his continuing rise to power as he loses trust real quickly. Filtering the media comments because of foreign influence is one thing, but filtering your own outbreak leaving your citizens in crisis is dangerous.

Although I would say China has been much quicker to react and less cover ups than the previous SARS outbreak in 2002-2003. Also one comment to note is how quick the mayor of Wuhan announced resignation because he covered up the outbreak by denouncing the severity levels. What will happen to him afterwards? Will he go to prison or will he just walk away free taking tones of money with him while the whole country goes through this crisis?"
2020-01-27 18:21,"This is a run-away train.

Not even the full power of the Chinese state can cope with multiple crises all at the same time.

And here I beg to differ a little - while undemocratic regimes always deserve critique for obvious reasons, in this instance, they do seem to act quickly and decisively.  Cordoning off such a large area and population is a strong move in the right direction, as is sharing info, something one can never take it for granted at all with totalitarian regimes.   The devil here is probably in allowing the ugly, unhygienic, and apparently dangerous animals-market to exist but that train has left the station ..."
2020-01-27 19:06,"In the 60s when Taiwan was under KMT's martial law there was a humor magazine that eventually got on the bad side of the Chiang Kaishek governing machine. They did it by commenting on the current affairs with clearly sarcastic humor.

When Chiang was thinking of changing the constitution to get a third term he mumbled something about if he stepped down whoever succeeded him should have the ""confidence of the US"". Right away the humor magazine put out an editorial suggesting the his American educated wife should be the successor. 

I think the mainland people should adopt this type of attitude to combat censorship. They could, for example, praise the coronavirus as gift from god to show how efficient the country is so they can pose an immediate ""quarantine in-place"" on 30 millions people.

I think the only way to combat overt censorship is through humor. Though it could only do so much because eventually that humor magazine was shut down.

There is always going to be nutcase and crazies in society and they tend to come out during crisis. It is a good thing China is cracking down on rumors hard. I have follow this paper’s coverage and coverages in Hong Kong, Taiwan, and Filipino news and forums and you wouldn’t believe the nonsense people are posting. Take the official number, add two or three 0s at the end, and you get the idea how crazy rumors are.

Just yesterday my sister told me she read (from Taiwanese news I think) all highways in/out of Wuhan are still open with all lanes except one lane that requires inspection. I just told her to look up photo of the blocked highways.

The number of dead and the number of those infected is definitely going to be a whole lot more than the information they have allowed to be filtered out.

In 2006, it was warned that China’s wildlife markets were ""poorly managed and insanitary"" and were “a dangerous source of possible new infections"" by its own experts.  2006.

It is so ironic that Chinese Communist leaders have been distracted, worried and concerned that Chinese society might be “infected” or “contaminated” by Western values and ideals.   Instead, Xi Jinping and the Party ignored the real threats to his people. 

This corona virus was preventable and avoidable.  China should have learned from previous pandemics in China (especially SARS in 2003).  It did not.   Maybe this time will be different.  But if it’s failure to protect its own domestic pig population from African Swine Flu (another virus) is instructive, future prospects are dismal.

So if Xi Jinping is afraid of Western values, we should be terrified by what the CCP does NOT value, such as human health, acceptable governance, transparency, truthfulness and being a responsible member of the world community.  Xi should be concerned about his own future. Rightfully so."

There’s an Ebola epidemic going on right now in west/central Africa that’s killed tens of thousands in just a few months.

We have more important, wealthy country things to think about like nuclear war and how quickly we should destroy the environment (oh which also increases the infection rates of these diseases). 

You want to change things? Elect politicians who have a long history of caring for the poor. Force your elected officials to open their eyes even if they don’t want to see.

We must stop getting angry at governments and scapegoating individuals; nothing they have done will make any long term difference.

The coronavirus will take about 60 days to spread across the entire globe.

The only real question is its lethality. That remains to be seen. If it is high, no matter what is done, medical systems worldwide will be overwhelmed.

The threat of zoonotic disease is real. Instead of smugly repeating ""you reap what you sow"" and gleefully waiting for China to fail, to be punished, we should be supporting her in any way possible. I admit, my reasons are somewhat selfish. China is essentially attempting another Great Wall. There is much to be learned that will be useful for everyone later. What worked and what did not? We should also be doing everything in our power to help with the Wall. Much better to have the bulk of the battle fought there, to contain the Wuhan virus there. If China breaks and this turns out to be a bad one, I have little hope that any other nation will be able to mobilize as she has.

China is the 2nd largest economy in the world and can easily shovel billions of dollars to come up with a multi pronged approach to effectively stop the spread of the WCV. One of the prongs that is currently missing is a prophylactic response to enable those already exposed or in early stages of infection to give a chance to the immune system  to ward off the infection.

When there is a viral infection with a deadly virus like Ebola or WCV there is a race between the virus multiplying rapidly and the immune system being able to clear it. If the virus prevails and spreads through the lungs rapidly then the infected person could choke to death of inability to breathe. If the infected person can survive LONG ENOUGH to put up a robust immune response then the person can recover. Time is of the essence when a person is infected or exposed to WCV. The goal should be to keep an infected person alive as long as is possible with all means possible. 

I have spent 1/2 my life understanding how viruses trick our immune system starting from my  NIH days and I am trying to find out how I can help the planning and execution of an effective strategy to out smart WCV and save lives. An antiviral that could be deployed right away are EVNCs.

2020-01-27 16:13,"The American response to this crisis is quite telling. All condemnations and glee at the misery of others, and not a single ounce of aid."
2020-01-27 16:30,"IMHO, this virus is comparable to the ""Spanish Flu"" influenza virus when it appeared in 1917.  In that year, many people did not take it seriously because the total number of cases was small.  By 1919, everyone knew better but it was much too late to stop the worldwide pandemic.  The same thing can happen now unless drastic action is taken, regardless of the economic impact.  All travel to East Asia from the Western Hemisphere should be stopped immediately.  That means not just tourism but also business travel and diplomatic travel.  The virus does not care whether it is attacking a tourist, a business traveler or a diplomat."
2020-01-27 16:31,"Wuhan's mayor got one thing absolutely right: closing off a city of 1.1 million is unprecedented in human history. I can't see how this could possibly happen in any other country on earth. While it would cerntainly be unconstitutional in the US, I truly admire the collectivism and self-sacrifice demonstrated by the vast majority of Wuhan residents who willingly canceled trips and stayed at home.

The fact that China has had many virus outbreaks should also be put in context. You probably never heard of Wuhan before but it is more densely populated than NYC. Keeping a large population healthy is difficult and China's GDP per capita is about 1/6 that of Japan. SARS, as bad as it was, was eliminated in under a year. Unlike Ebola in Africa, in all likelihood this coronavirus will also go away in half a year. In that sense, we need to appreciate China's effectiveness."
2020-01-27 16:39,"A lot of fear and concern about day traders but not much info about the virus.

So you’re leaving us in the dark to guess what to expect?  Isn’t it just a more virulent form of the flu?  

So protect our kids and the elderly as best as possible?"
2020-01-27 16:53,The 1918 flu wiped out five percent of the world's population. Anything like it would probably equal or exceed that in today's society. We simply aren't equipped to deal with a constantly changing virus that is airborne. Scientists are racing to come up with vaccines even now but human testing will take awhile. Then it takes six weeks to grow a vaccine in a chicken egg. Shouting at them doesn't make it any faster.
2020-01-27 16:56,"The concern is the unprecedented quarantine zone.  It is a possible harbinger of a much greater problem than China is presently indicating. (A characteristic common in their past.)  China, and its leaders, are experiencing a very serious ""loss of face"".  And that conceivably brings political instability into the equation."
2020-01-27 17:00,"I’m living in Thailand and closely China.Moreover,Chinese tourism came to our country during this situation.Now,Having 8 Thai  people contacted Coronavirus.This crisis is a big problem that we faced because we haven’t medicine for this virus.Furtheremore,It’s easily contact one person to another one.We cannot do anymore than wearing the mask and avoiding to be among crowded people or tourist spots.

Not only effect to medical industry but also effect to Economic across the world especially in Asia. I don’t know when this virus will decline or disappear.I just hope we can control this crisis and find out the method to treat people contacting Coronavirus."
2020-01-27 17:37,"The problem in China is that they have something in their constitution (CCP rules) that says unchinese-like conduct is punishable with imprisonment or worse, i.e. the opposite of free speech.  So that all lower echelon officials are afraid to say anything that those above can say is unchinese-like, which includes any bad news.  Fires in nightclubs are not reported; a whole train was attempted to be buried after a major crash.

Unreported infectious disease outbreaks is just one of the problems.  Major air and water pollution is also not reported, because all the emphasis, reports from below to above, must fill yearly development quotas.  The rush to oblivion through global warming/climate change is written into the Chinese constitution.  

Unless those at the top realize that this is the major problem facing the world today and decide to do something about it.  Maybe they could even have influence in persuading our own climate deniers--paid off by our oil and coal oligarchs--to do something about it.  Anyway, in a top down system, the Chinese could get something done fast if they wanted to.  

Here not removing Trump is not the only stonewalling going on.  Stonewalling sponsored by Exxon, the Saudis, and the Russians on climate change is keeping the voice of the people from being heard."

China’s open air ‘markets.’  Japan’s brutal Taiji dolphin slaughter. Spain’s hideous bull ‘fights’. Our own and other’s torture and slaughter of animals on a unprecedented industrial scale.  Or the mass shootings and marketing of opioids.  Anger at the barbarity.  Anger at the greed. Anger over the deaths. We should be disgusted with our behavior and furious with ourselves."

During SARS outbreak between November 2002 and July 2003 there are a total of 774 combined deaths reported in 17 countries."

Why not trade the cost of their medical care with helping  car for the sick. 

Building a new hospital in a few weeks is impressive but army tent hospitals with cots and portable generators can be deployed within hours. Infectious diseases kill more people than any modern war. It makes sense at a minimum to fully utilize those resources now."
2020-01-27 18:04,Having abandoned the term- limited collective leadership model Chinese President and Chinese Communist Party Chairman Xi Jinping is going to either have to take singular personal responsibility or punch down the government and party leadership and force someone else to take the fall for him.
2020-01-27 18:35,"What? The mayor of Wuhan offers to resign? I am against it.

First of all, taking personal responsibility is, I think, against the system that believes the Party Central and therefore its minions are always correct and the ""system"" is paramount compared to the individual. Besides this is a natural disaster thrown at them by God. You say they don't believe in God? OK, thrown at them by the supernatural in which they do believe. Remember they legislate about the reincarnation of the Dalai Lama?

Second of all, resigning over ""personal responsibility"" sets an extrenely bad precedent. All powers are forever until purged by The Leadership Core. It is never up to the individual to ""resign""."

The sad part is that so much that should have been done this far into the 21st century has yet to be done . The Flu itself is reaching epidemic proportions on an annual basis. Every public restroom should have motion detection technology built into the water , soap and paper towels. Any place in which thousands of people a day traffic there should be no door handles to touch , even elevators should be voice or motion detector activated . The less things you have to touch the better. Eyes should be protected by eye ware just as the mouth can be protected by a mask. And let’s end the darn handshake. And please keep your distance no need to invade a person personal space during virus season. All of these ideas and other will work to reduce viral contagion. And please keep your sick children at home and don’t send them to school."
2020-01-27 18:23,"More than the disease it is panic that will cause immense problems. My suggestion is for the chinese govts. to set up pop up booths In each neighborhood, that dispense hot medicinal teas  in disposable cups. There are plenty of herbs that can help people feel better. Boiled herbs, less chance of infection, makes people believe that the govt. cares and gives people hope that the tea might help. Chinese star anise, lots of thyme, galangal root, ginger, lavender, throw in the gamut. Make it mild so it does not interfere with  medications. Ask other countries for help. Ask for cleaners, wipes that can be distributed to the populace. Get people from uninfected regions to volunteer to cook and distribute vegetarian foods. Offer incentives to people volunteering instead of silly threats.

With the proposed cuts to the CDC, may I point out anyone voting republican is decidedly myopic. Rich, rebellious and very dead does no one any good. Please vote blue in 2020, else we might be brewing homemade teas to combat this virus right here too."

2020-01-27 19:36,"It feels like with all the information the US has, it’s playing a very reactionary role to the virus.  Kinda waiting until things get ugly.  For instance, the LA case was a person returning to Wuhan—who did he infect since we know the virus can be transmitted before symptoms show up?  Or are they keeping us in the dark like the Chinese government does?  Our government and public institutions need to be proactive like other countries are doing.  I read that France is bussing citizens out of Wuhan and doing a waiting period before flying them to France in contrast the US is flying citizens directly to SF, how about if they don’t have symptoms and are carriers of the virus?"
2020-01-27 13:59,"I know Wuhan well - spent much time there with their health leaders.  The Chinese health authorities in Wuhan are very capable, which will make this outbreak better managed than if it had occurred in many other places (including many places in the US).  However, Wuhan is essentially the world's largest university town, with about 1 million university students, most of whom probably started traveling outside of Wuhan before travel was banned to be with their families during the Chinese holidays. The timing is what is making this so horrific for the Chinese.

The reflex of people to travel away from the Wuhan area is probably a bad reaction for them and for all of us.  Best to isolate one's self away from sick people and take universal precautions with all humans, rather than to get out in public and travel on trains and airplanes. 

The US is poorly prepared for these types of outbreaks, as Congress wishes to micromanage the CDC budget, which has been stripped of flexibility to manage the next outbreak.  Congress tends to fund weeks to months after the next outbreak instead of funding baseline funds to prepare.  CDC leaders have warned about this problem for decades, and hopefully soon Congress and the American people will listen before the ""big one"" hits."
2020-01-27 16:11,"The United States is one of the most highly segregated countries on the planet. The odds of an American of any ethnicity other than Chinese contracting this virus is basically .00000000000001%.

It’s astonishing how many Americans are so terrified of a virus that is thousands of miles away, but they’re completely unconcerned with the fact that there is fentanyl and fracking fluid in their drinking water and cadmium and silicon nanoparticles in the air they are breathing."
2020-01-27 19:48,"In marketing, stratified advertising is used to target an audience whose members share certain traits and who are most likely to actually purchase a particular product. The 
common characteristics of this audience match the product traits that are  very effective in differentiating, selling and enjoying the product. With this simple paradigm, consumer data is often used to design many internet sales campaigns to better match the audience and marketing message.  

The coronavirus seems to work similarly. It seems to be especially effective in targeting stratified samples of the  elderly, and their decreased lung capacities; and their older, less effective immune systems. Also, other individuals with opportunistic infections that tax their immune systems seem vulnerable to this virus. And, males seem to be more vulnerable to this virus than females.  

Perhaps the coronavirus just emphasizes anew how vital the delivery and exchange of O2 for CO2 via the lungs is to human health. And, how influenza, smoking, and obesity can all, individually and as an interrelated group, degrade this critical respiratory system.

(Of course quarantines are not 100% effective but it's better than nothing.) The US has plenty of its own issues from e coli contamination to lack of clean drinking water due to fracking with plenty of dis-information from the government as well. Also, let's remember that this is the birth place of the anti-vaxer movement as well.

Instead of blame, maybe we should spend more time on how to partner with the Chinese to help this situation. 

If you've been to a US airport and on a flight in the past few weeks you realize just how ill prepared we are in the US to face this potential. Many not even covering their mouths when coughing or sneezing, lack of hand washing, etc."

2020-01-27 21:50,"I would lay odds that this epidemic did not just emerge from a meat market and into the most vulnerable populations.  I would bet that it spun up in the schools undetected, like many flu and parainfluenza outbreaks do.  How would this be possible?  Well, you can't test for something that you don't know is there, and nobody gets tested unless they are hospitalized or dead.  This very well may have infected young people first, who presented with ""flu-like"" symptoms and recovered.  A survey of school attendance records would either support or refute this theory.  It should be looked into - because if this did proceed like a flu epidemic, then it is probably more widespread than any quarantine can contain."
2020-01-27 22:08,"Remembering the many stories of immigration here in our nation, I recall quarantines of immigrants were routine sometimes as the passengers were screened for health, and a normal precautionary logical thing to do.

Those coming here should be educated on the importance of self isolation during the possibly contagious asymptomatic time they may be a carrier of the disease for the greater good of everyone. It's a matter of personal responsibility everyone should consider, not be forced into. Simply tell passengers, they would save other lives."

There's a tendency to view the autocratic Chinese government as the prime mover of  repeat pandemics. Of ignoring safe practices for it's population. I see the Chinese people working in tandem. They choose to disrespect their environment and all it encompasses time and time again. They demand live animal markets and uphold archaic superstitions.

I understand that there’s a cultural issue involved—the deep-rooted Chinese belief that eating exotic wild animals confers health benefits. (Oh, the irony!) Repeatedly, however, this practice has resulted in the transmission of human-to-animal pathogens. Therefore, to continue to allow the sale and consumption of wild game under any circumstances seems the ultimate human folly."

2020-01-27 12:49,"The mainland Chinese corona virus reveals the gross incompetence, negligence and governance of the CCP in protecting the health and welfare of not only its people but of hundreds of millions of Asians and non-Chinese worldwide.  In 2006, it was warned that China’s wildlife markets were ""poorly managed and insanitary"" and were “a dangerous source of possible new infections"".  This came from a leading expert.

It is so ironic that Chinese Communist leaders have been distracted, worried and concerned that Chinese society might be “infected” or “contaminated” by Western values and ideals.   Instead, Xi Jinping ignored the real threats to its people. 

The corona virus was preventable and avoidable.  China should have learned from previous pandemics in China (especially SARS in 2003).  It clearly did not.   Maybe this time will be different.  But if it’s failure to protect its own domestic pig population from African Swine Flu (a virus) is instructive, future prospects are dismal.

So if Xi Jinping is afraid of Western values, we should be terrified by what the CCP does NOT value, such as human health, governance, transparency, truthfulness and being a responsible member of the world community.  Xi should be concerned about his own future. Rightfully so."

Note: Scientists working for our Trump government have been resigning/leaving/retiring in droves, according to the Washington Past last week

2. Positive Role Modeling and Demeanor to calm the U.S. population and inspire us to do the right thing and comply with the necessary measures to contain the epidemic.

3.  Track Record of Honesty and Truthfulness to give us citizens the confidence and trust that he is telling us the truth about the spread of the virus, its seriousness, and how best to deal with the epidemic.

4.  Or does President Trump even care, and is he preparing to handle the possibility of an epidemic/pandemic killing many citizens?  Or, is he too busy obsessing about himself, his impeachment, and getting even with his many perceived enemies?  

My guess is Trump will he treat this epidemic just like he has been treating the threat and reality of climate change.

Contemplate that stock market!"

     At this point it makes no difference to the rest of the world whether the Chinese are doing enough to contain the spread of this illness or not, they have already exported this illness to the outside world
    Unfortunately, there is no vaccine available to protect against this virus known as 2019-nCov. I don't know how the CDC is going to handle this epidemic if it spreads in this country. As per CDC 110 people in this country are  being evaluated at this time
       The U.S. government was racing Monday to evacuate Americans from the city (Wuhan) at the center of the deadly coronavirus outbreak in China. 
       At least 81 people have died in China from this new virus, there are unconfirmed claims from anonymous health workers in China that many thousands more than their government is acknowledging could already be infected. We will never know the truth from the Chinese government, this is a tragedy for China and for the world."

2020-01-27 22:45,"While it’s easy to blame the Chinese for their lack of sanitary habits when it comes to wet markets and the selling of exotic foods, I think the spread of the virus could be blamed largely on the political landscape. 

There was absolutely NO SENSE OF EMERGENCY during the first few phases of the virus. This could have been limited, but it seems that the communist party only cares when there are already alarm bells ringing everywhere. 

I can only empathize with the Chinese on this pandemic as I am sure no one is deserving to be wiped out because of a disease they were not aware of. 

In fact, I don’t think majority of them are educated on the consequences of exotic animal consumption. Despite it being a “cultural” problem I feel like this could have been prevented had the Chinese known the hazards. Some of the wildlife they consume are just barbaric to be honest.

Why and how the pigs got infected is still undecided. Well before these pigs were put to their death my guess is that a large supply were not put down and that is why this new disease became a derivative and stretched to other live stock and now can be spread through the air. Pigs were also diseased in North Korea. China may have to investigate the North Koreans to find out any modifications made. After the infection China is really showing a very weak system for they are used to bring dictated to outside of consumption and saving. This is why the average Chinese family tries to save as much as possible. This is the tip of the ice berg and travel internationally should be stopped immediately until investigations are completed."

2020-01-27 23:40,"So many points come from the left media as well as from the right media in the US on how China is inefficient when dealing with the virus. Some ""leading medical experts"" are even being doubtful about efficiency of the lockdowns across the country because ""too many people already left the city so let the rest go out as well"". This is great indeed, that we all have an opportunity to share so many diffirent points on solving the problem. But really, if those medical experts were so productive in drug development as they are in condemning China's efforts we could have the different  tally of deaths caused by viruses . Secondly, it is easy to debate the flaws, while being far from the epicenter.  But if the same outbreak occured in any highly populated city outside China, the outcomes could be even more severe. When it comes to SARS, there were dozens of deaths among medical personnel in Hong Kong and Toronto, although their medical systems deemed more ""advanced"" in both cities at that time, when compared to China. So, I believe,instead of continuous criticism there should be a deep cooperation between the authorities around the world and China to prevent the spread of the germ."
2020-01-27 23:51,"It would be good to see some finer detail on the fatality rates. It’s reported at around 3% of total cases and that most of the fatalities have been older men with pre existing illness. Since the total case rate covers a broad range of age and all sexes, the slice of the total case load that comprises older ill men might be rather small. If so, recalculating the fatality rate just  for older men with pre existing disease might result in a very high number, perhaps close to 50%. That could make it more dangerous than the flu for this specific demographic."

I live in east midtown near a restaurant that seems to cater almost exclusively to large Chinese tour groups. Sometimes there are lines of them stretching down the block waiting to get in, their tour buses idling nearby. When their meal is over they may linger in the herb shop recently opened next door or go to the Morton Williams supermarket across the street for a look and maybe a purchase of several boxes of powdered mill (go figure).

Of this recent coronavirus we know little yet.  The ratio of deaths per cases of this new coronavirus cannot be known, because we cannot know how many people have already been infected.  This is due to the nature of the virus:  people can be infected, asymptomatic, and carriers of the virus for two weeks, and we cannot know how many infections there have been because there could have been many cases that have come and gone without diagnosis.  In sum, it is too early to know whether this coronavirus is any more deadly that the common flus that we contract every year.
Just as the stock markets are reacting in a volatile way to daily news, people and governments are currently panicking at every news release about the coronavirus.  It may turn out that this new strain of virus is more lethal than what we usually experience.  On the other hand it may turn out not to be such a ""pandemic"" after all is said and done.

2020-01-28 1:18,"Some thoughts:

1) It is ridiculous and misleading for medical experts to hold themselves out as experts on quarantines and travel bans.  Quarantines and travel bans are not medical science.  They are exercises of police power and politics.  

2) China will probably have a tough time enforcing fully their quarantines since the quarantined area is so large and it is completely bordered by land.  Therefore there are innumerable places for sneaking out by simply walking out.

3) There is a huge difference between a travel ban and a quarantine.  A quarantine keeps people in whereas a travel ban keeps people out.  Keeping people out is something that is done by nearly everyone, every day.  We keep people out of our homes etc.

4) A travel ban prohibiting people from entering the US who have been in China during the prior 30 days is easy to enforce.  We are separated by oceans on both coasts so the only way to arrive is plane or boat.  Either way they must go through one of just a few ports of entry.  Passport records show where they have been even if they are not arriving directly from China.

5) Trump should have imposed a travel ban 5 days ago.  It is still not too late since we so far have only a tiny number of cases and all are people who came from China, not any transmitted by them to our domestic population.  Even when some do start to show up, we have a good chance to contain the outbreak if we stop more disease from arriving from China."

2020-01-28 2:52,"It important to recognize the brave effort of healthcare workers in 
China notwithstanding their leaders and politicians. It is also time to reflect on our own country. 
I am in healthcare and I can tell you that right now most hospitals in our major cities are packed because of intense flu activity as well as an unabated opioid crisis. There are approximately a 100 individuals currently undergoing testing for coronavirus and anything more than that would soon overwhelm our system. We cannot build a hospital in 10 days as China did - our regulations would not allow it. 
Our hope is that we can develop a vaccine within the next few months. There are a couple of antiviral drugs that have shown some promise and we hope they will be effective. 
Short of that we too will be facing a daunting task of isolating large populations but we should learn on what not to do from the China very quickly. Large scale quarantines will be useless. CDC, NIH and State DOHs should issue uniform guidelines in a timely and transparent manner - what is known and unknown. Ensure adequate supplies of essential medical equipment throughout the country. Emergency funds to cover all individuals who are sick from this virus even for those who cannot pay - universal coronavirus care. We got to learn and we cannot afford to panic."

Influenza deaths number in the thousands annually but many Americans blithely go about the flu season without a flu shot. While I am a doctor I am not an Infectious Disease specialist but I am confident that this virus will be contained by the traditional methods that have conquered prior outbreaks of deadly viruses ( Ebola, SARS); namely quarantine, checking contacts, and eventually a vaccine. The contagion of fear may be more difficult to contain than the virus itself. The CDC is now making available its experts on television and the President has addressed it but if it spreads further, as is likely, further attention may be needed to quiet nerves.

Perhaps another down side to the lost of manufacturing jobs to China. By the way all those medications you take are made there too. We don’t t make squat on the USA any more. 

We are the least self sufficient society in the world.

Would we have been able to build a hospital to accommodate hundreds of patients in 16 hours, which China has done?

There is some positive news. It appears that the incubation period is shorter than the 10-14 days assumed earlier, and that transmission of the disease likely occurs only after the patient is showing symptoms. Earlier we were told that the disease could be transmitted during the incubation period. China’s National Health Commission just issued new guidance on treating this coronavirus. It says “respiratory droplet transmission is the main route of transmission”, but it can also be transmitted through contact. It says “based on current epidemiological investigations, the incubation period is generally 3-7 days, with the longest no more than 14 days”."

2020-01-28 4:36,"I wish there would be more education promoting hand washing rather than the use of masks and gloves. 

A drug store mask serves at best to protect others if one has the virus and is coughing into the mask and at worst adds surface area waiting to infect others. When worn by the non infected person, it offers no protection against becoming infected. 

If people are touching the mask with their hands as they inevitably will when taking it off, the mask becomes colonized with all the agents that have been living on the hands. And if they touch their face after that, there wasn't really a point in wearing a mask in the first place. And if the mask is left on a table, it's colonized the table. 

The importance of minimizing physical contact, washing your hands repeatedly after touching others and touching surfaces in high traffic places, as well as regular disinfecting of surfaces cannot be overstated.

For those in Asia with much more recent memories of the farm life animals like turtle, snake, and other fare are not an oddity but rather a delicacy, and they cost more. 

Besides the danger of exotic viruses there is the very real danger of species extinction. Here in the US we have regulated hunting which not only assures the survival of all hunted animals but actually funds their study by biologists. In Asia our NGOs work to study wildlife but they also work to end all hunting instead of working to implement the very successful conservation programs we have here in the USA. The Wildlife Conservation Society mentioned in your article set up a tiger conservation program in Laos by expelling many villages and encouraging the dictatorial government to outlaw subsistence hunting. The result after many years,,,, no more tigers in Nam Et Phou Louey Tiger Conservation Area. 

Maybe it's time to turn all Asian hunters into conservationists as has been done in the USA. If there were a new virus infecting snakes or bats or fishers in the US there's a good chance biologists would already be aware of it. It's long past time to work with indigenous hunters in Asia."

2020-01-25 20:12,"This is a deeply rooted cultural phenomenon beyond superstition and the idiotic needs to flaunt wealth. Hopefully scientists and epidemiologists can work with historians, philosophers, sociologists and anthropologists to understand the Chinese propensity for game meats (without a particular propensity for hunting as Europeans do). When I was in Shanghai, every other restaurant in a forest restaurants boasted servicing game meat or exotic seafood. This epidemic, horrible as it is, is an opportunity for cultural change. It can be perfect tied to the 2020 Winter Olympics to promote a more progressive lifestyle."

The Earth and its resources are not getting appreciably larger; population grows and is growing geometrically, like a hockey stick; and there are 7.7 billion people on the planet today, which is more than have lived AND died cumulatively since the beginning of time.  It is impossible for all those people to make more and more and faster and faster demands and changes to our ecosystems, without a negative affect.

2020-01-25 20:36,"China needs to mandate that all food be sold in modern supermarkets with meat lockers and refrigeration units, and prohibit further sales of live animals in open-air markets situated in large cities.

This underscores the reason why the U.S. has very strict laws about keeping livestock in urban areas, it’s unsanitary to say the least and poses a major health risk to residents of crowded cities.

There was a recent Times article about how China is shaming citizens who wear pajamas and other attire deemed unsuitable/inappropriate when appearing in public, indicating that China is concerned about it’s global image, even at the most superficial level.

Following this most recent and past outbreaks of deadly viral infections that are known to originate from these open-air markets, China needs to re-evaluate its global image on a more substantive level and understand that as a major global power, it has important responsibilities to the world community as well as to it’s own citizens.

What people choose to eat is their own concern, but China can no longer turn a blind eye to this outdated practice of condoning the sale of livestock and un-refrigerated foods in essentially, unregulated open-air markets."
2020-01-25 21:20,"More than one of my Chinese friends has commented that “this would not have  happened in Shanghai or Beijing.” By “this” they meant the apparent unpreparedness of the local governmental and medical establishments to deal with the problem efficiently and forthrightly, but they might as well have been referring to the existence of “wet markets” that traffic in exotic wildlife. Wet markets are common in Shanghai; the one I frequent for fruit, vegetables, and eggs is clean, orderly, and, as far as livestock is concerned, offers nothing more unusual than the panoply of live fish, eels, and bullfrogs that can also be found in most Chinese supermarkets. It seems that among the great strides China has made in modernizing its infrastructure to an almost futuristic degree, eradicating rural superstitions has not received the same attention. I think that’s about to change."
2020-01-25 21:40,"Animals rarely consumed by humans may carry pathogens to which the human body has no immunity.  Thus, sickness occurs after infection and death can be an outcome.  It is not a matter of lack of refrigeration or of animals being confined in cages.  That the Chinese government has not effectively banned the commerce of certain animal species likely to carry so-called novel viruses, for which humans have no immunity, is surprising and inexcusable, following the SARS crisis.  
We have treaties to prevent the spread of certain weapons and discourage warfare between nations.  We need international pressure, with treaties, to ban commerce in animals whose consumption could lead to a world-wide pandemic."
2020-01-25 22:18,"This growing epidemic is an excellent example of what continues to happen when human needs and cravings, whatever they are, come first. As a visiting scholar in China 30 years ago, I was served pangolin soup for lunch along with turtle and snake, only to find out later that pangolins are endangered. I was shown a live civit cat in the back of the restaurant and asked if I wanted to eat it. I politely said no thanks. A civit cat was later traced as a source of SARS. Almost nothing has changed. Humans have just about eliminated all wild mammals from the planet. Can't we stop doing this? It isn't so hard to be a vegetarian; I've been one since that trip to China."
2020-01-25 20:48,"All of this would be OK, with a bit of hygiene, were there not so many people.  Too too many people, too many mutating viruses, too close quarters, too little ecosystem to clean and balance it. 
Sad to think, but possibly the only chance for humans not to be included in the numerous species that are soon to be extinct, is for some really nasty virus to take out out 9/10ths of us."
2020-01-25 20:55,"The mere fact that the pangolin, one of the world’s gentlest and most critically endangered creatures, is still being consumed in China is appalling. This alone, even outside of the sickening brutality and conditions of the meat and slaughter markets, makes me step outside of empathy for my fellow humans. Reap what you sow."

We can add rampant zoonotic diseases and epidemics to a whole other list of reasons why we need to stop eating animals. As if the meat and dairy industries aren't causing enough destruction with being the number one cause of climate change in the USA, you can now look forward to mass epidemics and death thanks to how despicably we treat other living beings."
2020-01-25 22:03,"Scary ironic to me that the possible source of the coronavirus that seems to have been set loose in Wuhan in China, comes from one or  more of the Chineses 'Wild Meat' markets that have long been criticized by conservationists the world over for their role in the decimation of endangered species- Like the tiger, rinocerose, pangolin, sea turtle and asiatic black bears. 

 One would have thought that the Chinese Government would have learned by the the world's recent frightening health epidemics that were generated by cross species contagion of deadly viruses,  like SARS-Pigs (China) and HIV-monkeys (Africa), that turning a blind eye to the open trafficking in wild meat- or to simply continence unproven and superstitious and harmful folk remedies- is simply playing Russian Roulette with fate or nature (to say nothing of ignoring the tragedy of extinction)."
2020-01-25 20:15,Eating animal products is evil because it causes heartbreaking suffering. Evil has consequences.
2020-01-25 20:38,"When I first visited Asia as a child and learned from relatives there that wildlife, including baby wildlife, were kept in cages and then consumed as “delicacies,” I was distraught.  It’s incredible that decades later and with greater access to information and more availability of alternative food sources, nothing has changed.  Time for the world to drag these people into the 21st Century."

This is why despite pouring money all over the world China will never truly be respected.  When you allow a practice to flourish that the vast majority of advanced cultures find abhorrent, you are going to rise only so far in the eyes of the world."
2020-01-25 20:48,Chinese food markets are a hazard to the health of the world.These are not tiny markets in remote places.They are gigantic markets in cities where millions of people live.No delicacy that the Chinese fancy is worth the possible origination of a new and lethal pathogen.The markets must be regulated and closed if necessary.The Chinese passion for rare food that is sold alive needs to be halted.SARS terrified the world just a few years ago and now they have a new virus which is spreading.The Chinese certainly do not want to be known as an unhealthy country to visit or the country of origin of deadly diseases.

2020-01-25 22:44,"The circumstance of trafficking in and eating all manner of wild animals—including many endangered species—is abhorrent.

2020-01-25 22:13,Love the picture of a table covered with unrefrigerated raw meat.  And pangolins are critically endangered.
2020-01-25 20:22,"The tradition or custom of Chinese using contaminated chopsticks at family dinners transmits viruses and bacteria. It is not only airborne coughs and sneezes and contaminated hands that are modes of transmission.  I often see family members and friends eating with chopsticks pick up food from serving or communal plates with their personal chopsticks and offer food across the table to other diners using those same personal chopsticks that were just in their mouths. Clemson University (2009) studied bacterial transmission of this practice (custom) and found significant bacterial cross-contamination (placing fellow diners at risk of health issues).  I was just at a pre-Lunar New Year dinner with friends, one of whom was clearly sick with a cold or flu, and I refused offered food by others’ chopsticks.  Yet people were picking up pieces of food in communal serving dishes with their chopsticks, eating it, then picking up another piece of food and putting it on someone’s plate. The next day I got a bad bug.  Hundreds of millions of Chinese will be unknowingly following this unhealthy practice during this holiday at multiple dinners.  

Xi and the CCP can quarantine cities but he can’t quickly change this unhealthy custom among Chinese everywhere."

2020-01-25 23:17,"Dr.  Robert Koch presented the ""germ theory of disease"" in the 1880s.

This latest virus, likely related to some interplay of the infectious material transmitted between animals and humans, serves as a reminder of how epidemics and pandemics start.

A century ago, the 1918 H1N1 Influenza virus was responsible for millions of deaths worldwide.  H1N1 is still the most common variant of significant influenza illness.

The coronavirus is simply the most recent emergence of a virus that has shown the capacity to jump from one set of animal species to another.  In this case, from chickens, cows and pigs to humans.

Modern scientific practices have been developed to greatly reduce the incidence of events like these, but it is a reminder to us all that lapses in proper handling of food products can lead to serious public health consequences."
2020-01-25 23:02,Not necessarily true with the flu.
2020-01-25 21:11,"As someone who spent 2 to 4 weeks a year in China from 1985 to 2013 this is very much a cultural issue.  The restaurants of quality , outside of high rises, all offer pick yr own live game.
Snakes, fish,turtles ,crabs, even  dogs, cats and rats in some cases in tanks and cages.

Proof of “safety and purity” you pick out yr live meal.  
Dancing shrimp, live shrimp dumped a hot plate at your table.  They jump around. Does prove you aren’t gambling on the mediocre refrigeration and sanitation.

 Those over 40 are still believers. Hopefully the kids will phase it out.
Nothing like fried “ little deer” ie rat. A high end specialty in Guangzhou."
2020-01-25 22:11,"Ebola is another example of a human disease that recently jumped from animals. It was bushmeat, the flesh from infected primates, that was the likely vector for human infection. Eating apes or monkeys is plain cannibalism and we now see the consequences. At the same time we are pumping antibiotics into industrially produced pigs, cattle and chicken, resulting in widespread resistance making these drugs ineffective. That China still allows hunting of civets for consumption, the same animals that were the resource of the SARS virus, is mindboggling. It looks like humans can't learn and old habits are hard to extinguish"
2020-01-25 23:03,"Eventually the practice of eating wild animals will end because most of them will be extinct soon. Having said that, we in the US need to do more. Why are ducks and boas allowed as pets? What explains rampant pythons gone wild in Florida? If the Chinese are damaging their environment what about Australia where the fires are likely due to rampant urbanization?"
2020-01-25 22:22,"China is the black hole of endangered species.  In about a 15 year span, the African pangolin has gone from plentiful to the brink of extinction. All because of China’s appetite for all things rare.  The pangolin will go extinct faster than any animal in history, and for no other reason than it’s a status symbol."
2020-01-25 23:15,"These new viruses are our planets way of fighting back against the human onslaught. If the viruses don't win this battle, the earth dies off from human over population."
2020-01-25 23:13,"I would liken this menace to what Americans expose themselves when they eat wild deer meat and wild boar meat. The sale of these meats is banned in the USA, but people are still allowed to hunt these animals and eat their meat. Several states encourage this practice or at least turn a blind eye to it. Several diseases have crossed over from these species into humans including variants of BSE/TSE. There should be urgent recognition of the risk these people are taking by eating these animals and putting risk on the rest of society. There should be controlled culls of feral species like Deer and Pigs and the carcasses should be destroyed."
2020-01-25 23:18,"To play devil’s advocate, the US meat industry is arguably just as cruel and likely ends more animal lives in a week than these markets do in a year. The total annihilation of chicks for nuggets scraps of meat, the cramming of animals into enclosures, and the scientifically perfected method of hormone injections and feed controls are common knowledge, but they are safely hidden away from the eyes of the consumer so all we see are nicely packed pieces of pink/red meat. 

I would like to believe the average Chinese person does not consume random exotic animals regularly, but the situation is similar to how most American will try out deer, gator, shark, or any other non-industrial meat at some point. Again, these unusual foods are usually processed neatly away from view for Americans. The Chinese culture has a preference for knowing where there food came from and that includes the unsavory points before cooking it. 

That being said, you reap what you sow. These places are not regulated like industry food and exotic animals are going to have an extra level of risk. I don’t see this problem being addressed in the near future."
2020-01-25 22:56,Humans should turn vegetarian or vegan.  We also should abandon ancient superstitions about food and religion.
2020-01-25 22:39,"China is actively building a totalitarian state, is persecuting its Uighur minority, has no respect for the environment, intimidates its neighbours and refuses to recognize their borders, steals the intellectual property of its competitors, and, when Canada detained the Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou subsequent to an extradition request by the United States, promptly arrested two innocent Canadians and threw them in a dungeon, where they remain.
China is a poor global citizen in a myriad of ways. Spreading deadly diseases is just one of them, though perhaps the most revolting."
2020-01-25 22:58,"“Are you sure it is eating wild animals that has caused the epidemic?” Yes, Zheng Ming, we're sure! 

If the sellers think it's okay to cause a worldwide pandemic because they ""observe the law,"" then the law needs to be changed."
2020-01-25 23:40,"The cause of this crisis is so transparently evident that not even an authoritarian government like China's will attempt to blame it on evil foreigners, but instead be forced to drag its society into the 20th century regarding best practices in public health."
2020-01-26 0:33,"It is my understanding that the flu, which kills thousands here and around the world, comes every year from Southeast Asia. It incubates among farmers in very rural areas who, in many cases, live in the same building as pigs, chickens and other animals. Each year it mutates into different molecular forms and the vaccines offered here, which are concocted before it is known which form flu will take, represent the best estimation, the best scientific guess, about where the mutations will go.

While the current outbreak is scary and sensational, standard flu kills many more people on an annual basis (provided the current outbreak is somewhat contained). Why has little or nothing been done to try to stop the passing along of new flu strains each year? Is it an impossible task or simply one that no one has considered trying? 

We spent 3 to 4 trillion dollars fighting two wars in the middle-east with a great cost of life but it seems the best we can do about the flu is a shot, one which might or might not be effective. Millions of lives are potentially at risk if the flu takes an unexpected turn one year. Our efforts are not good enough."
2020-01-26 0:42,"If China truly wants to be a renowned world power, they must stop these markets and ban the practice and sale of these animals for consumption.

If they continue to allow this, the rest of the world will eventually ban contact with China and anyone who travels there. 

This is China's chance to do something right, for once..."
2020-01-26 0:47,"A somber way to begin The Lunar New Year in China in 2020, where this virus appears to have surfaced in the southern region of the country from poor living conditions, contaminated Water, Environmental hazards and lack of Sanitation in populous omnivorous and wildlife markets. 

The Western world might help contain this virulent epidemic outbreak, where coronavirus brings to mind the devastation of 'The Asian Flu', over a century ago.

International scientists and health experts might make a concerted effort to seek out similar symptoms to the above, and ways of helping those at high risk exposed to this dangerous and contagious outbreak.

The government appears responsible in detecting the source of this disease and raising public-awareness; the vendors of this wildlife know that this is no longer a legal venture, and it is not too late for officials to place the safety and lives of humans, first and foremost out of the eye of this 'hashtag' market.

Keeping up the health campaign announcements on the social media platform and placing a ban on game may be life-saving, while an emergency search team of experts  takes place for a cure-all."
2020-01-26 0:52,"I just saw the first episode of the Netflix series Pandemic and one of the health professionals who appears in it was talking about the likelihood of the next pandemic to originate in a livestock market somewhere in China.

2020-01-26 1:42,"Interesting image of a market in Shenzhen, China in 2016. Looks much cleaner and appetizing than the market in Shenzhen I saw in 1996. That I saw 20 years before this image was taken during my visit to the most populated country in the world with a rich ancient history  the was nauseating because right after the entrance I saw dead snakes lined up and in the very first aisle behind that were all kinds of live and dead animals and backyard chickens and slaughter yourself animals like sivet cats. I remember refusing an invitation from my friend from HK inviting me for a dinner which his mom was preparing that included pigeon meat. It is no telling what the Chinese will have an appetite for. One thing that everyone who has got on the band wagon of the Chinese exotic markets needs to know is that viruses don't emerge overnight they jump from an animal species to humans over several years.

China has come a long way in the 25 years since my first visit to Shezhen. It is today the 2nd largest economy and food habits of the Chinese people has been changing. One of the largest section in the grocery store in Beijing was a large variety of Tofu or soy bean curd. It was no surprise that Soya beans are a major export of the US farm products. Another major export from the US is pigs especially since a large number of pigs died from a swine virus epidemic just recently. China is facing the worst viral infections in history after several years of viral evolution and jumping to humans."
2020-01-26 0:48,"The best defense against this new virus, as well as others, is to wash your hands frequently, the second being to avoid constantly touching around your mouth and nose. 

It is not easy to wash before eating, especially in fast food joints. Every restaurant should offer a means for getting your hands clean. One example is to place the wash basis outside the restroom so that it is easily accessible.

There was a report tonight of an airline taking a sick passenger off a commercial flight tonight in Baltimore. This should be a common practice. The airline price gouging by making tickets non-refundable encourages people to fly when they are sick and, therefore, to spread illness to other passengers. Gee, thanks, American Airlines.

There was a case years ago where a plane sat for hours at an airport in Alaska. One person had the flu and before it was over, about 90% of the other passengers came down with the flu, too.

I travel with a face mask for some protection but have very rarely used it. I will use it now with less hesitation. Another step is to bring a sanitizing wipe to use on the armrests and fold down table. In the past, people would have laughed at these precautions but they are not likely to be laughing now."
2020-01-26 1:29,"On a trip to a large city in rural China some years ago, a visit to the local open-air market was like a visit to Hades with small, yellow dogs jammed into cages to be sold as food. A small zoo near the Mongolian border put a tiger and a wildebeest in a pen about 1/4 acre in size, and the tiger's pursuit of, toying with and eventual killing of its prey was part of the afternoon's entertainment. This same zoo had trained ""sun bears"" to ride unicycles on tight wires 100 feet in the air. Cultural differences aside, American mores had little place in that society."
2020-01-26 1:55,Anyone who had lived in China long enough knows seafood is usually sold where the veggies are sold. Those ‘seafood’ markets never sell seafood.

2020-01-26 1:22,"One of my takeaways in my first trip to China is that people have no choice about anything. Their lives are monitored, jobs dictated by the government -to the point that they can show up to work and be told that their factory has to be raised that day for a highrise. People themselves will bend over backwards to be kind to a foreigner but when it comes to their own individual lives there isn’t one. So I’d imagine you’d develop that same sort of attitude to any live animal: it’s just protein, its life doesn’t matter. If only Co would open the floodgate to...having a few options, a bit of joy in life, compassion for anything living. The people would follow."

Regular folks like you and me, ie properly Westernized people would never!

The bottom line is, as long as there is consumer demand and weak regulation, these markets will continue to exist and provide a source for emerging viruses as well as not following listed species regulations. The Chinese government could end this very quickly."
2020-01-26 3:22,"In France, a chicken is regularly sold at open air markets with its head and feet. This is the true at markets both organic and not. The butcher will the cut  off those appendages, if the buyer requests. It doesn’t make the fowl any less healthy to be sold in its entirety. And in France ( probably other European countries) the poultry is closely surveyed by health officials, which may not be the case in China.  
But the journalist is dramatizing the story by making the assumption that feet and heads ( however alien to American sensibilities) are by their nature, unhealthy. Or so it appears."

2020-01-26 2:19,"There is nothing inherently cleaner or more sanitary about eating a chicken or a cow or a pig compared to eating a snake or a bat. I suspect the issue is that the killing, preparing, and storing of these animals is not done in a sanitary way (cleaned surfaces, cleaned tools, no combining parts of different animals on the same surface, the use of cold temperatures), that prioritizes freshness, discourages the growth of bacteria and viruses, and minimizes their transmission.  

The importance of hand washing with the use of soap should be emphasized. Masks purchased in the standard drug store are just another surface to be colonized and another biohazard waste product that can serve to infect others if not properly disposed of. Not to mention adding to landfills like single use plastic."
2020-01-26 3:27,"The Chinese government needs to stamp out these outrageous live markets that traffic in wild animals and sell endangered species parts.  The could almost certainly do it if they wanted to. The superstitions connected with eating animal parts in Asia are ingrained, but trade needs to be regulated, and an aggressive campaign against these practices waged.  It's not only important for public health, it's important for the species being ravaged."

2020-01-26 2:52,"This practice of the Chinese eating unusual animals has to stop if they want to prevent future outbreak of disease in the future.  The method of transmission with viruses like SARS is that the birds who are sick fly overhead and leave their droppings, then the animals eat those droppings, and then the people eat the animals.  You can't continue to do that if you want to prevent these outbreaks.  The foods should be kept to the more conventional ones  that can be properly screened.

This is not a poverty prone area, there is no reason to keep this unhealthy habits risking the whole world population to fall under a deadly disease just by cultural practices.

2020-01-26 3:39,"The NY Times reports that China has suspended tour groups traveling abroad.

This implies their government is very worried about the consequences of more infections being reported outside of its borders.

If a major outbreak occurs in another country or countries, the United Nations WHO agency will finally be forced to declare a global health crisis and China all be held accountable, the last thing China wants.

It would be a PR nightmare and there might even be calls for outside intervention and oversight committees, these are consequences the Chinese government fears most above all else.
If China can keep the WHO out of its backyard, they can easily fix the numbers of infections and fatalities to downplay the severity. 

If they can keep the infections contained to their own shores, with no further infections being reported from overseas, they can continue to maintain a firm grip on how they choose to run their own affairs, which may or may not have any appreciable impact on the open-air meat vendors and the sales of endangered species.

This is all about political maneuvering as far as I'm concerned."

Human waste is commonly used a fertilizer in China & Mexico. Determination of the country of origin is oftentimes impossible as our FDA (under the GOP-lead streamlining) has made disclosures opaque. The benefit of the virus spread will be to reduce the human population to a manageable level ~2 billion. So eat up and enjoy your meal."

2020-01-26 3:50,"The other dimension is that refrigeration is used sparingly if at all. Not only is it less expensive for the retailer, but the Chinese like room temperature or ‘warm’ meat. In addition to other issues, the lack of refrigeration causes bacteria to multiply."

2020-01-26 11:39,"An article in The Guardian about the coronavirus last week quoted a source who said the Chinese people ""don't care about animals . . . don't believe they are able to feel pain or suffering."" This indifference contributes to the way these animals are treated by farmers, traders, retailers and customers. It's a dismal, brutal situation. Not that farmed animals are treated well by any culture, once the truth behind the scenes is exposed by investigators. If we care about animals, we won't eat them. There's a growing abundance of plant-powered foods toward which we as a species must progress.  We do not need to make animals suffer in order to be healthy and well-fed."

Therefore, I have little sympathy for people who suffer problems from eating meat and no sympathy whatsoever for people who murder the animals.  In a sense, their is a cruel justice inflicted by these diseases from the wild animals who have been captured, murdered, and eaten by the Chinese.  That justice being meted out by the murdered wild animals would not bother me except that the diseases spread from the wild animals don't limit themselves to attacking just the people who murder them or eat them."

Personal hygiene is lax, markets are dirty.  Animals are slaughtered right in the stall, which Chinese believe in freshness as quality and for food safety.  As one can see in the photos meat is put out in open air without refrigeration with flies buzzing around, a pefect health threat situation.  Chinese government should start banning live and wild animal meat altogether and with penalty for violators.  World Health Organization and other countries that have been affected by these outbreaks should exert pressure on Chinese government to stop the trade altogether. This move if successful would stop the killing of wild animals for food and medicinal medicine and elimination of the threat of animal extinction, e.g. African Rhinos.One more action the Chinese government should take is through education and the enforcement of hygiene in meat selling markets."

2020-01-26 5:53,"The practice of the Chinese eating wild animals, some of them endangered species, has to end.  Not only is it cruel and inhumane to these innocent animals, but it's endangering the public health of not only people living in China, but around the world.  It's no coincidence that the source of most global epidemics is China.

Maybe if the U.S. and other nations curtail commerce with China until it stops inhumane practices and threatening global health, it's government will get the message.  (not likely that will happen of course, given corporate America's thirst for cheap labor)"

Coronavirus may sound more contagious but people should understand it is because Wuhan is a major hub of commerce locally, nationally and internationally"
2020-01-26 3:48,"Not surprisingly, the vegetarians and vegans immediately take the opportunity to hit their virtue signals button. And the commentary on the Chinese abhorrent treatment of livestock which challenges Western sensibilities is predictably Euro centric. Let us not forget that the US is the world's largest source of industrialized meat production, resulting in arguably exponentially worse treatment of animals than the experience of an open air market. Ever seen how your burger gets made? How about that roasted chicken? There's no open air market for those poor animals. Just because we're not eating bats doesn't entitle us to pass judgement, and certainly doesn't give us carte blanche when it comes to the ethical treatment of our livestock."
2020-01-26 15:29,"Thanks for far more information than I've seen elsewhere on the Chinese live meat markets.

You've got one thing wrong; if you look on last week's article based on the sequencing of the ""new virus"", it IS SARS with minor genetic variations.     They could have happened in the last 13 years or existed in the host animals.   That chart says it and most other corona viruses are bat viruses; a coronavirus seemingly has to really work at being called a different animal's virus, like human.   

Also, they REALLY need to do epidemiological bloodwork on the people of the cities where this virus and its SARS sister have been recognized, and find out exactly what kind of a problem SARS is.   Even Ebola turns out to have infected far more people than ever knew they were sick, making it less likely to kill you than thought.   My favorite is West Nile; anywhere between 5% and most people in large parts of the U.S. have had it and never knew they were sick, so only a small number of people who catch it are ever diagnosed.  In both the U.S. and China, you don't go to the doctor with a cold or minor flu."
2020-01-26 4:49,"An American who lives in both China and the US talked about the epidemic in his Youtube account. One thing he mentioned was that the government regulations are strictly enforced...when a higher up is there watching. Once they leave, enforcement might slack off.

While China’s share of this trade is unknown due to the trade’s illicit nature, China is widely recognized as the world’s largest market for trafficked wildlife products. As the Chinese economy has grown, demand for wildlife products—including endangered species—has increased, contributing to the decline in populations of iconic species such as elephants and rhinos, as well as lesser-known species. Three factors play into Chinese demand for wildlife products: (1) wildlife products are valued as status symbols; (2) wildlife products represent a financial asset with stable or increasing value; and (3) wildlife products are perceived to have health benefits related to traditional Asian medicine. Until recently, however, public knowledge in China about wildlife trafficking and conservation efforts has been limited.”  Dec. 6, 2018 staff research report by USCC.gov."

And yet I've never seen any outcry to ban the commercialisation of poultry. It's the unfortunate fact that any activity in our food production chain may lead to sanitary risks. Why are we singling out the Chinese practices as particularly dangerous? I'm yet to be convinced than by any *objective* measure they are.

And the scale of killing in a factory farm is many orders of magnitude larger. Americans consume 4x as much meat as Chinese do per person. So Americans cause much more animal suffering than anyone else.

Isn't this the way we raise our animals here in the U.S., tons of animals raised in close quarters while the excrement they produce are stored in large open air untreated sewage pits located next to the facilities that house these animals.  These pits are nothing but microbial vats from which eventually will rise some sort of bacteria or virus that will be found resistant to any type of treatment.

As long as the CHinese government continues to allow and turn a blind eye toward the controversial wildlife trade and consumption of live animals in the name of respecting “culture,” SARS, MERS, corona virus outbreaks will continue. Temporarily banning the wildlife trade is a drop in the bucket and will not help. Many Traditional Chinese medicine practitioners have already abandoned the use of endangered species animal parts in treatment, yet quackery still exists and the direct trading occurs in neighboring countries where the smuggling of animals can easily be brought to China. In addition, viral videos of young Chinese eating “bat soup” etc in the midst of the coronavirus outbreak (one in particular was shot in China, but claimed to have been made in Palau) clearly demonstrates the stupidity, and selfishness of a few who think they are above Mother Nature’s wrath, as well as science. I also will not limit the existence of wet markets solely to China, as they also exist in other Asian countries ie Philippines as well.  When will some humans ever learn about the balance of nature and perhaps, so-called “ancient” practices and superstition may need to be Re-evaluated, especially when an increasingly wealthy Chinese population can travel to areas and infect those like myself of Asian descent who want to hurl at the thought of consuming civets and wolf pups.

   Now the Corona virus, one more thing the Chinese are going to export to world market. We do not know how many people died in China due to the corona virus, the Chinese are not going to report that. I am happy that the CDC in Atlanta is closely monitoring this respiratory illness.
SARS, MERS ( Middle East Respiratory Syndrome) and the new Corona virus ( 2019nCov) all have the potential to cause severe respiratory illness, pneumonia and even death.

I think this outbreak will leave a mark on the minds of many folks for at least a generation without any regulations.

2020-01-30 14:43,Didn’t the Times publish yesterday that hand sanitizers do not work on diseases like coronavirus?  Confusing.
2020-01-30 15:04,My question is what happens to viral particles traped in these masks when they are disposed of. If they are casualy tossed might they in fact spread the desease they were intended to prevent.
2020-01-30 15:25,"There isn’t really any evidence that wearing masks in the surgical OR reduces infection of anybody, patient or staff. But hand washing does."
2020-01-30 17:17,"There is a difference between a surgical mask and a respirator.
Modern disposable respirators have a nose clip and if worn properly fit against the skin of the face. The best ones have a valve on them to ease breathing in and out. The N95 & P100 filter about 95% of particles and wet infectious materials greater than 3 microns in size.
The surgical mask is a lose-fitting enclosure over the mouth and nose. The gaps allow easier breathing for people in respiratory distress and prevent medical professions from breathing directly on a patient, including during surgery.
N95 and P100 are the respirators to use, better than surgical masks. But any mouth-nose barrier is better than none when around coughing/sneezing people including yourself. Wash hands with soap and water or alcohol-based cleaner when taking them off to avoid potential for self-innoculation.
If you need professional help on these issues, find an Occupational Hygienist who specializes in respiratory protection. We are represented by the American Industrial Hygiene Association."
2020-01-30 19:24,"OK.... few things to break down here:

1)  there is a social psychological benefit to wearing masks by everyone where there is a pandemic outbreaks.. as in the case current in Wuhan ---> it constantly reminds everyone to stay vigilant.. keep your human to human contact limited, was hands , disinfect shoes, and most of all.. dispose of the mask at the end of a days use AND wash hands completely with soap and water. 

2)  In pandemic areas, again.. such as current Wuhan, when everyone wears a mask.. they are less likely to transmit or receive infection from airborne expulsion of the mouth AND keeps peoples hands off their face more effectively. 

3)  A mask is only part of the equation.. because it is likely foamites (ie"" body fluid left physically on physical items, including sweat from the hands)... hence being careful to keep hands off your face until they are completely washed and sanitized, and avoid touching physical objects in public spaces... like handles, glass doors, countertops, etc. 

That said.. wearing a mask, and doing nothing else precautionary... is a waste of time and assets."
2020-01-30 17:10,"Well, since China is the land of the face mask and it hasn't done them any good, I wouldn't bet my health on face masks ."
2020-01-30 21:12,"I've always been pretty vigilant about washing my hands, esp after being on the subway, in a taxi/Lyft, at the market, handling money, etc.

Typically, as soon as I arrive home, one of the first things I do is wash my hands, and again before I handle any food.  I routinely wipe down surface areas, esp doorknobs, fridge door handle, light switches, etc., with a vinegar/lemon solution.  And when out and about...in public... if I need to yawn/cover my mouth, I only do so with the back of my hand (and not my palm, which would have been more likely to come into contact with germs...).  When going up/down stairs on the subway etc., I don't Hold the rail with my palm, but rather, glide the topside of my hand along the rail, so it's at the ready should I need to steady myself.  But otherwise I don't touch the handrails...."
2020-01-30 21:50,"Using face masks can fill two important functions: 

1. They generally reduce the number of virus particles one inhales, not by 100%, but by a meaningful amount. 

2. Masks also reduce the number of virus particles expelled by infected persons when they cough or sneeze, not by 100% but by a meaningful amount. This is why you see pictures of infected patients wearing masks even in isolation wards, to reduce the chances they will infect others. 

Thought for the day: If you are on a plane or train or subway and your seatmate starts sneezing or coughing, put on your own face mask and offer your seatmate one, too. 

Due to the coronavirus outbreak I have started carrying several masks with me when I travel in order to deal with just such eventualities. 

And, while washing one's hands frequently with soap and water is a good idea, it isn't always feasible, so be sure to carry pocket/purse-size bottles of sanitizers or those tiny hand-wipe packets that are even smaller."
2020-01-30 22:29,"I keep seeing pictures of Chinese wearing masks, but no
gloves. Bare-handed. The masks won't save them from tiny droplets from sick people nearby. It's the sick people who should be wearing them. As for catching these viruses, avoid them by using hand cleaners. Keep you hands away from your face! If you have an itch on the face, scratch it with a shirt collar or sleeve. If you absent-mindedly pick at your nose, soak toilet tissue in hydrogen peroxide and stick it up your nose. Avoid sneezers and coughers. Take the stairs, instead of the elevator. And wipe that shopping cart handle, they did a study and found all sorts of harmful germs on them, even TB. I never take the flu shot, and haven't had the flu since 2006, after a plane flight in February."

Here in Japan, people will wear masks year round sick or not, it can be for a variety of reasons, vanity is one that I know is popular. Wearing masks can also be used to hide emotion, your eyes can show some emotion but if the rest of your face is covered you can't tell if someone is happy or sad."
2020-01-31 10:26,Another thing people haven't thought about is when people discard the masks they are supposed to be put in a sealed plastic bag then put in the rubbish. All rubbish handlers should be supplied with masks as the masks will be breeding ground for the virus and they end up at the dump so all dump workers should be supplied with masks and protective clothing as well. They're doing away with plastic in NZ so it will be hard to find a  recycled plastic bag unless you buy sealed plastic bags from the supermarket.
2020-01-31 6:19,"Masks do more to protect others from your cold than you from others' colds.

Still they can offer brief protection from someone coughing directly in your face on the bus.   If that happens I change the mask though.  (Austin just went through a flu epidemic.  And it's so hot and dry on a city bus in cold weather you get sick without people coughing in your face)

But where did anyone get the idea you can only catch a cold by not washing your hands.  I once spent a day with my mother, we never touched the same surfaces, we did sit together on the bus, and she caught my cold.  I once spent a day outside, walking around, with friends who were getting over stomach flu, and boy did I catch it.   We never both touched the same object.  And it was one of those colds that hit both the chest and the stomach, equally hard - probably a corona virus, since that's about the only cold virus that can do that.   I had dry heaves for an entire day, and then a high fever and a terrible chest cold.  I was in college and on spring break I had no access to medical care.  I called my parents, 500 miles away, and sounded so sick they almost came and got me.   If it happened again I'd go to the ER.

Viruses (such as swine and bird flu) spread like wildfire because although they may be tamed within the wild/animal species, once they have made human contact, it is a whole new virus our bodies have not yet seen, hence the lack of immunity we have for it.

The biggest fear I have is human to human transmission, and the huge migration of people worldwide right now for the Chinese New Year. It doesn't take much for a contagious virus to spread, especially how we are mostly centered in cities and around air travel nowadays. A case was just confirmed in Chicago, and it was from a woman who traveled to Wuhan back to Chicago via air.

While WHO hasn't declared a pandemic yet, but it's time for the airlines to be ready to start cancelling flights to and from China, put all of Asia on on a watch list, and offer free waivers and refunds for any cancellation out of concern to prevent the spreading of a virus. The health of world needs to be considered over profits. Sadly this personally impacts me since I have plans to go to Taipei next month for the Lantern Festival, and I am very concerned stepping foot in Asia if this continues to spread."

2020-01-24 16:17,so it's not just old people who are at risk. good to know.
2020-01-24 16:37,One of my fears is that China is covering up the extent of this new virus. One of my friends living in Taiwan says that the number of people affected by the virus and the number of people that have died in China is way more than the numbers reported by the Chinese government. The Chinese government as usual cannot be trusted to give the truth.
2020-01-24 16:29,"So for 26 people die from this new coronavirus.   But according to CDC's estimate that up to 42.9 million people got sick during the 2018-2019 flu season, 647,000 people were hospitalized and 61,200 died from the flu in the US alone.  So why is this new coronavirus a big deal?"
2020-01-24 16:21,"The CDC says of 63 patients under investigation in the US, 11 have tested negative. How many have tested positive?"
2020-01-24 16:53,"As Wuhan citizens, we now only see information like desperate doctors, lack of food, medical devices for hospitals. We try our best to raise money for resources, but we don't know how the money will be used and if they will be deployed properly. I just wish those patients in the hospital can receive the best treatment but not another waiting for death."
2020-01-24 17:10,"Mortality rates, while important, aren’t the only consideration in a new outbreak. Survivors who have to spend weeks in the hospital or many days in intensive care before discharge consume large amounts of care. It appears hospitals are already taxed in and about Wuhan. And people generally aren’t hospitalized just for fever and a cough. They have to have serious problems like respiratory distress, shock, or underlying illnesses that place them at significant risk. 

For now we have to trust the Chinese government and their public health system for most of the facts. But even in the most advanced countries, data lags events. And in rapidly expanding epidemics, things can escalate in a matter of days. Interestingly, Google has been able to correlate certain searches with the incidence of flu in a community. Perhaps the surveillance state and associated AI being established in China can brought to bear. I’ve little doubt they’re looking at that, but they are less likely to share those methods.

We also have to hope the mortality rates are low, most infected individuals don’t need hospital care, and contagiousness can be managed with simple measures. It’s also a reminder that there are no shortcuts to having a robust and adequate public health system. It’s very hard to spin one up in an emergency."
2020-01-24 17:23,"""some residents complained they were not able to get the treatment they needed""

There IS NO specific treatment for this virus (if you can't breathe, you can get oxygen, if you can't drink, you can get IV fluids - supportive care only) . Tests to diagnose the infection have to be performed by the CDC AFTER state dept of public health and CDC determine that there's a high enough probability of the disease to warrant testing. You're not going to get an answer quickly even if you are tested. The test is for epidemiologic purposes, NOT to help the patient, because there is no specific treatment for the infection. It will be bad for us all if many concerned people with flu-like illnesses overwhelm doctors' offices and hospitals."

26 deaths => 35 million residents locked down

Does this not strike others as odd? China is notorious about not being truthful about their internal affairs. I'm wondering if the actual death toll/infected cases is several orders of magnitude greater."
2020-01-24 16:54,"Times have changed from 2003 SARS. However unfortunately there are also things that are still equally bad if not worse. Coverups in the early phase, propaganda communication with lack of transparency. 

With the development of internet though, Mandarin speaking people with local connections could get information of fast deteriorating situation on the ground by the day. It’s almost a joke to see the official numbers disclosed of those infected and demised. Videos and front line doctor comments being spread suggest adding two 0s behind could be an underestimation. Not enough supply of clinical PPE even masks or gloves at the hospitals in Wuhan. Some doctors and patients in the locked down cities are on the verge of breakdown. 

WHO does not think this qualifies as pandemic or global emergency. China is so big and the spreading is fast from province to province. But you know, it is one country - not international. I’m not good with politics but I do know with the globalisation of this age, no major country could stay out of yet."
2020-01-24 17:41,"@Crown You ask: Why is it (the Coronavirus) a big deal when the flu kills many more? Well the statistic that you cite for US flu deaths, 61,200 for 42.9 million sick, is .14 of one percent . 

However the early numbers for the Coronavirus , cited in the WSJ, are 25 fatalities out of 830 ill, or 3% of the infected. So initially this new virus is killing at 21 times the rate that the US flu did in the 2018-2019 season. And there is no vaccination available at this time to slow it down or weaken its impact (like flu vaccinations here in the States). And we are not sure what happens when Coronavirus reaches those the elderly,  young and those compromised by other illnesses.

This fatality rate may change when care is given earlier. But based on the article, Wuhan is not prepared for this and the hospitals are already full.

Perhaps the world will rush supplies. They should. Or perhaps China will take a breather from imprisoning its ethic minorities. Instead of participating in mandatory re-education programs, they will send the minorities to surgical mask factories.

In the meantime, “Go, Wuhan!” from the government's cheerleaders may encourage the populace. Ironically, the citizens of Wuhan have nowhere to go. But no matter the politics, lets hope the rest of the world lends a hand. We are all in this together."
2020-01-24 17:08,"We are on our own here regarding this disease.  The WHO admitted that it is concerned with economic damage to China, not putting the health and lives of people worldwide as highest priority.  Trump is either asleep at wheel or is pulling another Obama (Ebola) by refusing to impose a travel ban.  No one can trust statistics coming from China which are surely understating the incidence of the disease. 

So, lacking both information and a government that acts with our health as its first priority, we must do what we can to protect ourselves.

1)  Do not fly, not even domestically.  Planes pack you in like sardines and intentionally recirculate the air inside during flight.
2) Avoid mixing with large numbers of people.  
3) Stock up on food now to reduce the number of grocery store visits if the disease spreads here.   Later, do necessary shopping at off hours to avoid larger number of other shoppers.
4) Get a supply of face masks now before they disappear.
5) Do not visit West Coast major city areas, especially San Francisco, LA, and Seattle as these are major ports of entry for people traveling from China.  If you must fly domestically, then especially don't book connections through West Coast international airports like SFO, LAX, and SEA since they are where incoming travelers from China will be changing to their connecting domestic flights. 
6) Avoid all tourist attractions.
7) Don't stay in hotels, especially major hotels that cater to international tourists."
2020-01-24 17:54,"So all of the non-China confirmed infections have so far occurred within people who have visited Wuhan and travelled abroad. There is no doubt that this will get worse. Assuming one of the criteria for a CDC test is “have you visited Wuhan, or come into contact with anyone who has” may only represent a smaller percentage of people who have made some sort of contact with an infected person whom they did not know personally. This is also flu season, so many people who get sick may just think it is the flu. As time unfolds, I would not be surprised to see these numbers increase significantly."

2020-01-24 19:29,"I think some perspective on this is needed. I was in China during the entire SARS episode. Not only did I survive, but no-one I knew was affected at all. There was a lot of crazy panic - boiling vinegar to clear the air, to the point that vinegar was going for hundreds of yuan a bottle; burning herbs to fumigate rooms, buying up of certain kinds of antibiotics as they were thought to be a preventitive cure, and so on.

I think a lot what is happening now, such as 'sealing off' cities (I suspect they are just closing the train stations of smaller places nearby to Wuhan, so people cannot travel to those places to get back home), is likely a similar over-reaction.

This disease doesn't appear to be spreading quickly among medical staff, which was a key problem in the spread of SARS. It's new year in China; pretty much everything shuts down now anyway."

The average age of these victims was 71.9 years with a median age at death of 71.5 years. Many of these victims, in addition to their age, which may be indicative of less efficient and effective immune systems, overall; also had other illnesses which probably increased the chances of a successful invasion by the coronavirus, simply because this virus could now act as a more opportunistic disease. It could now attack a previously engaged, or weakened, immune system. With the immune systems of many of these individuals protecting against a more diversified, panoply of illnesses, the coronavirus attacks were more lethal.

There is a severe lack of protective gear for the clinical staff.  It seems many clinical staff are tired after extended hours of duty. Clinical staff are being flown from other  cities to affected regions. Death rates appear to be greater than what has been admitted thus far. It seems most of the people who died had other medical conditions and very few healthy people succumbed. It seems to behave like Flu in that regard. But this is very preliminary. The Goverment of China clearly has failed in providing important updates to their people. There is total chaos. All this tells me that China, as big as they are, needs help.

   Lines like these only shows how threatened the propaganda machine in the West is about China. It may continue to serve the purpose of the mighty US military-industrial complex where most of our money is burned to keep the empire going but it does so much injustice to the fantastic technological advancements that humanity has made to address global epidemics in a timely fashion.

It's going to happen here. But we can learn from the cautionary tale. 

We probably won't but we still can.

It seems completely predictable that people are nervous. 

That the symptoms of cold and flu during the cold and flu season will make everybody afraid they have it — but keep that fear in check. Don't panic.

When they announce It's here! Call your doctor. Schedule a test only if they say it's warranted. Don't flood the emergency rooms where the real sick people are if you're sniffling for two days.

Don't believe anything on Social Media. 

Nada. Zilch. 

Even take info on news sites with a grain of salt. Listen for updates on the science and stay focused on the science.

A big pandemic is like a big earthquake — it's when not if. 

So far this does not seem to be the big one as it seems to kill only a fraction of those who get it and mostly only the weak. Cold comfort I know but keeping that in mind, when it does get here be willing to self isolate if you get it. Don't rush to see grandma one last time because you'll probably live even if you catch it and she might not if you give it to her.

Contagion is not rocket science. 

Dare I say it — walk or ride a bike instead of the bus or subway. Don't kiss and shake hands. Wash your hands _ all that stuff is easy to do. Because if it comes here the government is not going to save us, we'll have to save each other."

How many have died, how many of them are still in treatment and how many have been lucky/cured and able to leave hospital? When do we see a news article - maybe here in the NYT - going after this question? The WHO needs to know...just as much as we need to know."

But I am thinking why are we even allowing planes from China to land in America?

As I understand from news reports this virus is fast spreading.

While nothing comparable - we quarantined a lot of folks during AIDS when not much was known.

I also think that for a long time during the heydays of Al Quaeda - we worried about a ""dirty"" bomb.

Heck if I remember right - there was a panic in Chicago over a dirty bomb incident.

Here is a situation where a virus could kill a lot of Americans.

Very akin to a dirty bomb.

Come to think of it - potential terrorists may have found a new weapon unless we demonstrate a forceful response."

It's an insidious loop, no matter which way you look at it.
Re-localization is only a first step to solving these problems.
Re-directing all war machine $$$ toward the welfare of the global society would also be an essential step.

Then let's also look at BigPharma, the overuse of antibiotics, the raping of the Amazon forests (courtesy of the Brazilian dictator) which unleashes dormant ancient viruses into the biosphere...etc etc.  The human species is at the heart of Malthusian scenarios."
2020-01-24 21:30,"This shows that we’ve all got to be a lot more careful regardless of where we live.

And we’ve all got to watch out for each other too."
2020-01-24 21:38,In January 2018 China inaugurated the Wuhan bio-safety level four (BSL-4) laboratory of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS).  I believe that this is the source of the outbreak.

Anyhoo.

I was sick for a really long time. I went to urgent care 2x. But I never felt in danger. 

If this is a more acute version of that, yuck. That was one memorable illness. It was truly hard to shake.

Hope they can keep this contained."
2020-01-24 22:29,This is what the Chinese are allowing to be reported--it is probably far worse.  The air travel worldwide will probably drop severely.  The stock market is already reacting because travel restrictions make it difficult to go to work in China.

2020-01-24 23:32,"The key metric to follow is evidence of local spread (outside of China, none so far), not how many imported cases are reported.

If/when that happens, it will likely push the WHO over the edge to declare an emergency.

A key question still being investigated is the ease and mode of transmission, particularly if asymptomatic carriers exist and if and how much one is infectious during the incubation period. Secondary screening of contacts of the imported cases is certainly warranted."
2020-01-24 23:59,"Chinese officials publicly posted the genetic sequence of this new virus within a few days of the outbreak, confirming the virus originated in China and prompting global scientific collaboration on a vaccine. 

Is this to atone for China's inadequate response in the early months of the SARS epidemic when they attempted to hide the SARS virus and its origins? Or was the sequence so readily shared because China's officials recognized the need for international cooperation on a vaccine because the virus is much more dangerous than they are currently stating? I sincerely hope it's the former."
2020-01-25 0:08,"Unfortunately, China has a tenuous connection with intellectual honesty and truth-telling.

They will get assigned a bed only when another patient dies. The number of confirmed infected/deaths is low because Wuhan lack the proper tool to examine the coronavirus. It's like Chernobyl both in the sense of the reading is breaking the scale and in the sense that officials are too scared to learn about the latest and craziest development.

The disease is worse than SARS. Similar to SARS, it can be killed by immune system but no effective cure has been found. It's different in terms that it spreads faster and patients die slower. Unlike SARS, the coronavirus spread quickly in wild animals, making them dangerous vectors. Unlike Beijing government, Wuhan government surpressed the news for a full month, allowing worst possible spread of the disease. The Shanghainese paramedic organization Jizhenyeying estimates that it will be over by April or May. I would expect worse."

2020-01-25 2:33,"For anyone interested, the best movie concerning the events which are occurring in China is ""Contagion"".  It is much more realistic than ""Outbreak"". I gives a very reasonable portrayal of the beginnings and spread of a contagious disease.  It presents concepts such are Ro which represents the ability of an infection to spread.  Measles is highly contagious with an Ro of approximately 12 (each infected individual will infect 12 additional susceptible individuals).  ""Contagion"" not only covers this basic concept but also the efforts to monitor and contain the spread of infection.  

It deals very well with the complexities of this issue in a globalized civilization with easy and affordable travel."

Secondly we are most likely witnessing the media reaction to the communist Chinese government’s over reaction.  The state run dictatorship in China can impose sharp curbs on human rights and impose unnecessary quarantines just to look like they are busy.  

I happen to live in South Korea which is a much more free country by comparison, but they pulled a lot of the same paranoia when the swine flu was in full swing.  I’m guessing that a lot of people will probably catch this virus and then not do anything, because it will just feel like cold symptoms, their bodies will fight it off and then they will have an immunity."

No country has a credible response plan to deal with millions of sick and dying people. Yes, we’re all scared of the possibilities, and it’s not just the virus.

UN's WHO still protecting China's economic interests by refusing to declare emergency.  Our CDC (still headed by a presidential political appointee like during Obama) withholding information from public.  

We must protect ourselves since we have been abandoned by our government.  
1) Do not fly, not even domestically.  Planes pack you in like sardines and intentionally recirculate the air during flight.
2) Avoid hotels, especially major ones that cater to international traveling businessmen, government people, and tourists.
3) Get masks while you still can.
4) Stock up on packaged foods to reduce needed trips to go out to shop later.
5) Avoid all tourist attractions.
6) Avoid major West Coast urban areas since Chinese visitors frequent them.  
7) If you must fly, avoid connecting in LAX, SFO, and SEA since those 3 airports receive most inbound Chinese flights and passengers connecting on pass through the airport.
8) Avoid crowded venues like theaters and restaurants.

The Communists - having spent decades - convincing Chinese of the utopia they are creating - are loath to admit - may be, it's not utopia after all.

I have been in some of these Chinese markets - hard to believe that we don't have more epidemics of these kinds.

I think it's going to be a deja Vue  SARS all over again.

Though it may last a little less long - though with warmer weather around the corner - there is no telling.

2020-01-25 3:02,"As a Chinese millennial who has studied abroad in the US, I would like to share my side of the story. The government had quarantined the city of Wuhan and the Hubei district stopping all transportation to stop the spread of the virus. From the social media platform of Weibo, individuals have condemned those who chose to take anti-fever medicine to try to get out of the quarantine zone, but these irresponsible individuals do not represent the tens of millions who choose to stay in Wuhan. However, the supplies in the city are falling short but ordinary citizens are trying to contribute as much as we can. The government is trying to build a temporary hospital in a week for Wuhan, and hopefully it will be finished. The government is also showing live updates on how many people are for sure infected and possibly infected and now it’s almost 2000 and 3000. 

The most important challenge now is the LACK OF TEST KITS. It’s hard for all people (that’s probably tens of thousands) who show symptoms of the virus to test the virus and it’s been a long process for confirmation. This is the reason why all of us in China are also doubting the official number given by the government. .

In terms of the market where the virus came from, most Chinese doesn’t consume wild lives. We despise those who do because this action has encouraged a chain of illegal activities. 

At the end of the day, we are all humans. This virus could be a problem we conquer together. Let’s try to be more open minded."

Rumor are rampant and people are frightened. She sent me a screen grab reported to be a crying doctor saying that the size of the outbreak is larger than is being reported, but I (or anyone?) have no way to verify this. The consular web site has no information. This is very, very distressing!"
2020-01-25 3:21,"If Chinese Govt didn’t lock down Wuhan, it will be criticised as being slow in responding and allowing the virus to become a pandemic. But when the Govt does shut down major cities like Wuhan, it is perceived as draconian and hence the Govt must be covering up the severity of the epidemic. The truth is that the new coronavirus so far appears to be closer in deadliness to the flu than to SARS. So why the drastic response? Because this is a new virus and has serious risk of mutating and turning into something much more infectious and deadly, and the number of people potentially carrying the virus is much larger than the confirmed cases because Wuhan is a major transportation hub and the seafood market had over one thousand shops and is close to the train station. What was most likely inadequate was the local Govt’s initial response to cases of infection because of lack of coordination with national health care officials and because of political incentives that prioritise economy and stability. But the subsequent response by the national Govt has been swift and decisive, which will help to curb the spread. 

Instead of falling back to the standard trope about how Chinese Govt always covers things up, readers should try to understand better the complexity of China’s political system, it’s commonly criticised flaws as well it’s advantages. Max Fisher and Amanda Taub’s Interpreter column at NYT is a good starting point."

Chinese scientists isolated a new strain of coronavirus – given the initial designation of 2019-nCoV – which has been found to be at least 70 percent similar in genome sequence to SARS-CoV. With the development of a specific diagnostic PCR test for detecting the infection, a number of cases were confirmed in people directly linked to the market and in those who were not directly associated with it. Whether this virus is of the same severity or lethality as SARS is unclear."

2020-01-24 6:40,"When the Hong Kong economy collapsed in 2003 due to SARS, a key reason was the sudden loss of faith in the government and especially the Chinese government for downplaying the severity and censoring news that would have saved hundreds of lives.

2020-01-23 15:24,"Only would people who abuse freedoms of all kinds in such gross and self-centered manners would consider the quarantine of an area, a populace, in order to protect the larger good, if you will, an issue of ethics.

Indeed, human rights are sacrosanct, yet when one is a potential threat to others, even if by mere misfortune, one *ought* be responsible and honorable enough to do whatever is required to ensure the safety of others.

So, were a number of individuals sick in a certain region, those individuals including those potentially infected ought remain where they are, not travel, not mingle, and let the sickness (and yes, even death) pass.

But...people do not do that.  They fear, they rage, and they act with no regard to the lives of others.

So, a quarantine is necessary, and if the use of force is required, that is best for all until the issue passes.

We do it for livestock, so regardless of that being a distasteful analogy (we are all just animals, fyi), there is no reason to not do it to human beings, presuming medical care, etc., is being provided.

Again, if individuals would simply realize that they may have to sacrifice for the sake of others, then perhaps strong measures would not be required.

Mind you, in the US, we'd all just get sick really fast and, if death was the probable end, we'd die really fast, because we would be all running amok with our collective heads cut off, weeping and wailing.

Myself and mine, we'd be self-quarantined. Best to not knock."
2020-01-23 15:34,"Comparing this to quarantines in the 19th or 15th centuries isn't a very relevant approach to what is happening, it lacks both an understanding of modern epidemiology and the cultural competency of talking about the travel that's being restricted.

2020-01-23 15:41,"What has backfired really? The infected people all over the country had recently been to or has contact with people who's been to Wuhan. I don't see why limiting personal travel to the city is too much to ask. The government just cancelled flights and trains. You can still drive out if you want. It's so easy to spread the disease all over the world, especially during the lunar new year travel season. A lot of Chinese are canceling their trip to stay home. They're sacrificing their long-desired holiday to keep themselves and everyone around the world safe. Sometimes we have to sacrifice for the common good."
2020-01-23 16:24,"Something just doesn't add up.

With around 600 sick, 17 or maybe a few more dead in a city of 11 million, in a country of over 1 1/4 billion, we now have an international crisis, and on the surface, shutting down transport and trying to close off a populated city seems like a gross over-reaction, given these numbers.

Instead, I get the feeling that there's a whole lot more to this story that is being kept under tight wraps. If it's true that of 600 sick, 17 have died, then we are looking at a death rate of 2.9%. 

But we need to consider, too, that often people don't seek medical care unless they think they need it. So the real number of sick may be underestimated, in which case, the danger could be overstated. 

On the other hand, perhaps China is aware of a real danger and is under-reporting deaths. Or maybe they do know the source of this new coronavirus and are just not sharing. Maybe these extreme measures are essential for health reasons, or just to control the flow of information."

The issue is how severe this virus is and how well it can be treated. We should prepare for a serious problem to develop here in the US while hoping that human to human spread of the virus is not as easy as feared.

Fair and balanced per Fox? Just isolate the sick ones you say: Yeah, that doesn't seem to be working, probably because a consensus among scientists is that the incubation period makes this very difficult before the disease is already spread to new carriers in mega cities (dwarfing medieval numbers).

Even the Rich cannot protect themselves, if they employ servants who may not have healthcare and who might be traveling on public transportation just to arrive at work.

A society is better prepared for natural disasters and epidemics if it thinks long term and in view of every citizen.

2020-01-23 17:19,"There are many conflicting facts coming out of this. The reported cases have not changed for days yet China's response is bordering on massive. Unlike the AvIan Flu of 2013 where China hid the number of cases but the actual patients who were transferred by bus and driven around to avoid the WHO inspectors. Scientists from the UK have estimated at least 4,000 cases given the nature of spread. The cities in China are all massive with millions of people living in close contact. The government response may very well be robust to get ahead of the spread, or to curb a public discordance given the political climate in Hong Kong. Everything I have read about this new Coronavirus it is not considered as virulent as the previous outbreaks. But the nature of a novel virus is it's ability to mutate. Once it mutates into an easily spread and more virulent form it is impossible to contain. The next pandemic is always the concern for the WHO and the CDC so far we haven't gotten that signal yet."

Certainly, state media is missing an opportunity to educate people on the situation, but no one in China pays any attention to the state media. Xi is an intelligent leader; my guess is that after the dust settles, local officials will be ordered to crack down on live markets. Many people will complain, but it's clear that the central government does not want to risk a pandemic. Having twice spent spring festival with families in China, I know how disappointing the travel restrictions must be. I wish all of these families good health in the new year."
2020-01-23 17:50,It's unsettling to see how rapidly this virus has spread across continents.  I would hope that our U.S. public health authorities would urge anyone who has been near Wuhan in the past month or so to monitor themselves and notify someone if they develop symptoms.  Airport screening may not be helpful if it takes two weeks or longer for symptoms to appear.  I feel for the residents of Wuhan who are trapped inside this nightmarish scenario.  They must be extremely frightened right now.
2020-01-23 17:58,"The Wuhan city government has a problem that is faced by hundreds of municipal governments in China -- incompetence. China has some of the greatest scientists in the field, and they were quick to identify the virus, share its genetic information with authorities around the world and advise the city bureaucracy. But the Wuhan party cadres were overwhelmed by the need to create false sense of security during the most important festival of the year. It wasn't until Dr. Zhong Nanshan, a prominent epidemiologist, publicly declared the virus contagious on national TV, some 20 days after rumors of epidemic emerged on social media, that the public finally realized the serverity of the matter and started to take preventive actions. I can only imagine things would be much better had it happened in Shanghai or Beijing where government is much more experienced.

Why, I wonder, has wearing a mask while sick not become routine here? Studies have shown that masks do reduce the amount of virus sneezed and coughed out by those who are ill. There seems to be a desire to appear ""cool"" and ""unflappable"" that makes Americans adverse to wearing masks.

When we had bad wildfires and I wore a mask to reduce exposure to the irritating smoke, quite a few people implied I was ""over-reacting"". Well, no. I just didn't want to have a burning nose and throat that would be more susceptible to viral illness because they were dry and inflamed!

Maybe someone needs to create ""designer"" masks so Americans will be willing to wear them!"

The count is now 600 diagnosed and reported, an increase of about 50. Either this is inaccurate, or the “problem” has already begun to resolve itself.

This is another example of why meat consumption by humans is, at the very least, questionable. On the most extreme end: deadly."
2020-01-23 17:08,"Don't go to the hospital or doctor if you have a cold or a flu-like illness unless you're really sick. There's no accessible test to tell you whether you have the new coronavirus - specimens have to be sent to the CDC, which will take them only if certain criteria are met. You won't get an answer anytime soon. There's no specific treatment so you won't be missing out on anything."
2020-01-23 17:27,"The Chinese state media may or may not be ""playing down the crisis"" but an American media eager to slam China whenever it can can certainly be relied on to overplay it as part of the NYT admitted existential ""systems competition"" it feels America is in with China. In this competition everything appears to be fodder for pushing the preferred US narrative with China as dystopian nightmare. Reading the coverage and the comments you can almost see the eagerness for things to get worse - in China.Oh well, if your in a battle for hearts and minds your going to break a few eggs and exaggerate and mistate a bit. Isn't that how we got into the last 4 wars. Carry on."
2020-01-23 18:36,"The fear is real. Not just because of a virus. When a city shut down, people who do hard labor work or live on an unsteady income are impacted more than others. Without transportation, healthy people cannot return to work. On top of that, the cost of food and medical treatment inflates due to increase in demands and shortage of supply.

In China, the nationwide household registration system (Hukou) utilizes ubiquitous residence permit to control nationals’ mobility. Without a hukou, rural migrants or poor villagers have limited access to the city’s healthcare system or proper treatment. They might be less aware of the seriousness of the outbreak or the preventive measures promoted online. 

“Despite claims that services like WeChat are ubiquitous, internet penetration in China is only around 60 percent. Resources such as WeChat accounts or ID cards are sometimes pooled between families, with parents making use of children’s identities.”

Considering the fact that large number of doctors and nurses infected quickly even with all the protection on, the speed of spreading of virus and so much unknown about it, any responsible government has to take drastic measure to halt it out of an abundance of caution. Crawling out underneath of stone to bash Chinese government to score political points at this moment seems beyond the pale."
2020-01-23 16:43,"Something does not add up. Why are three cities closed down with a population of millions of people, ifthis virus has caused only 17 deaths since December. We have more deaths from a regular flu that that."
2020-01-23 17:15,"I think  Nature is telling us something that news writers and government officials don't want to address, and people, in general, don't want to hear: stop multiplying.  If populations continue growing (and mismanaging the planet), more outbreaks of viruses will carry on indiscriminately causing havoc and deaths of great proportions.  Viruses multiply and mutate faster than any scientist can come up with methods to combat them.  Facemasks?  What a laugh!"
2020-01-23 17:15,"There have been reports of a case in Glasgow, at the Queen Elizabeth hospital (other cases in Edinburgh also).  It appears the patient travelled from Wuhan in the last 14 days and has respiratory problems now and is under quarantine.

I wondered, in the USA, if a patient has no medical insurance, but are a public health risk, who pays for the forced quarantine?"

Last summer. my friend, visiting from the east coast, fell sick within a day. Then I became ill also. It took weeks before I was back to good health. How many others become ill also ?
Compare the deaths from diseases caused by re breathing diseased air,  to the 737 max victims. I have a feeling the deaths from illnesses, caused by greedy airline ceo policies,  has been far greater and will continue to rack up fatalities while the airlines rack up profits.
They need regulation. This is on top of their callous stuffing us into smaller and smaller seats that don't recline more than an inch or two, even on a 12 hour flight."
2020-01-23 17:32,"I understand the doctors treatment saying that do not worry and go home.

2020-01-23 18:22,"If what the Chinese officials are saying is true, then so far this virus is generally only fatal to older, already ill people. In that regard, it's not any more serious than a typical flu season. The worrisome part is not knowing the origins and potential for it to become more deadly."

2020-01-23 18:26,"It seems common practice the underreporting when exists a crisis of this magnitude, most probably to avoid spreading panic. We really do not know the real scope of this breakout, but I, as a Mexican national, this morning I heard through a news oulet, that there is one person infected in the state of Tamaulipas, Mexico, in the northeast. That state adjoins with the state of Texas. This individual is a Chinese citizen, he is a sort of professor and works for Mexico's Polytechnic in that state, an institution of high regard in the country,  and he had recently travelled to China. The news outlet did not provide many specifics or I missed them, but this news oulet is considered as one of the most trustworthy in Mexico."

2020-01-23 18:24,"Great coverage by the Times. Chris Buckley is an excellent and courageous journalist. His coverage seems to indicate that the Chinese authorities are finally treating the crisis with seriousness it deserves. It could not happen at a worst time as hundreds of millions of Chinese are traveling all over the world for the Lunar New Year day. It seems that the lethality of coronavirus seems not as severe as some feared. As with SARS, the silver lining of this outbreak could be improving China and the world’s response to public health crisis.

Living in Los Angeles, I fear that large-scale homelessness, wide-spread drug abuse, and fragile health care system is a recipe for major public health crisis. If there is similar outbreak of contagious diseases in the United States, could we respond in an effective way when so much of the vulnerable population are beyond the reach of the health care system and authorities? This concern should force the authorities to address the homeless problem and get people into housing. We no longer allow people to smoke in bars and restaurants for the fear of second-hand smoke, but half a million Americans are homeless and without any basic access to sanitary living conditions. This is a disaster waiting to happen."
2020-01-23 18:19,"China is marching in the right direction to stop the spread of the Wuhan Corona Virus (WCV) outside the epicenter but will need a lot more help from the rest of the world. Americans who think they can help resolve the crisis and stem the tide of the spread within the epicenter should be heard and I have begun that process of reaching out to Chinese Americans with an interest in the public health in China, to join hands to do what we can not just because the millions of people of Wuhan are our fellow human beings and brothers and sisters of the world's family because the contagion of severe acute respiratory syndrome could land on our shores and it is in everyone's interest to adopt a multi pronged approach to eradicate the WCV. 

I invite anyone who is interested in finding solutions with the urgency of now to come to Louisville, KY at their cost, to hear what ready solutions I have and to share their thoughts on what they might have. Consider this as an emergency for all of humanity and an opportunity in this hour of need for rapid deployment of solutions with a strong scientific backing that will be applicable to eradication of WCV."

2020-01-23 15:47,China quickly went from downplaying this emergency to banning travel for almost 20 million citizens in 3 cities. Let's hope it's a severe overreaction vs a realization that the situation is far from under control.
2020-01-23 16:37,"It has been 36 hours since the Chinese government has upgraded the cases that have tested positive and the number of fatalities. They seem to be turning away people at ER for either lack of beds or testing kits and their ability to protect staff. 

The closing off of the city and public gather places like cinemas gives one the impression that the spread of the virus has already eclipsed their ability to contain considering a two week incubation period."
2020-01-23 17:58,"The Wuhan city government has a problem that is faced by hundreds of municipal governments in China -- incompetence. China has some of the greatest scientists in the field, and they were quick to identify the virus, share its genetic information with authorities around the world and advise the city bureaucracy. But the Wuhan party cadres were overwhelmed by the need to create false sense of security during the most important festival of the year. It wasn't until Dr. Zhong Nanshan, a prominent epidemiologist, publicly declared the virus contagious on national TV, some 20 days after rumors of epidemic emerged on social media, that the public finally realized the serverity of the matter and started to take preventive actions. I can only imagine things would be much better had it happened in Shanghai or Beijing where government is much more experienced. But these major cities probably don't have a unregulated, illegal wild animal market that was the source of the disaster in the first place."
2020-01-23 16:42,"With so many people in the world living in such crowded conditions, the ease of travel all over the world, and the weakening of our antibiotic defenses, the danger from a deadly virus or resistant bacteria increases.  

We need to plan to be able to contain outbreaks like this virus.  Banning travel and large public gatherings seem like good first steps."
2020-01-23 17:43,"It's very hard to know the exact situation in Wuhan. The official number largely is just a reference to what minimally happened. Not everyone who felt sick seek medical attention, and most hospitals and private clinics do not have test kits that detect the virus. And it's in the middle of flu season and in the middle of the travelling season. Estimation reported from the UK using epidemiological model is just, an estimation (by a model, mostly based on unrealistic assumptions and incomplete data, and usually not that accurate). 

It seems that the virus is not as virulent as SARS or MERS. Most people who died were seniors with existing chronic ailments, who would as well have fought an uphill battle if it was a common flu. The local government posted a sweeping travel ban on a megacity of 11-million population overnight with literally no advanced notice could mean either the situation is dire or the government unnecessarily overreaching . The latter is likely given that the central government has pressured the officials in Wuhan for a swift resolution."

A) a country with a universal healthcare system of some sort that covers the whole population, and labor laws that ensure paid sick leave to all workers. 

-OR-

B) a country with a non-universal, for-profit healthcare system where accessing healthcare is expensive at best or financially inaccessible/unaffordable at worst for the majority of the population, coupled with weak labor laws where workers are not entitled to any paid sick leave at all.

I choose A."
2020-01-23 19:51,"Sars was first reported - by text message - as a virulent form of pneumonia spreading among hospital staff in Guangdong. A few weeks later, after the media finally acknowledged it, the situation was claimed to be under control, and news of its spread disappeared from official media, until the Hong Kong outbreak forced its way in from the international press. Only then was any action taken, at least officially, on the mainland.

This case appears to be different. There are no reports of widespread infection of medical staff, the cause was announced right away, and travel restrictions are being imposed, though likely too late and rather pointless now.  

I'd also like to point out that the population figure quoted for Wuhan is, like all such figures mentioned in the international media, not for the urban area itself but for the much larger municipality of the same name, which is a bigger area that would include many surrounding towns and villages in the total population figure quoted."
2020-01-23 20:11,"The most recent information I got from people inside China is that Wuhan reached its capacity to diagnose and treat new patients. The number of confirmed cases is still relatively low, but this is mainly because there is a lack of detection kit for the virus in local hospitals. There are probably 10 times more suspected patients than what has been confirmed. Many people (in the number of thousands at least) from Wuhan escaped to Shanghai just before and after the closeoff of the city. Some probably went for treatment since Wuhan hospitals could only take new patients with severe symptoms. Those with less severe symptoms were sent to home for self isolation. There are still patients who walk on the street without any protection. It is much worse than what has been reported so far!"
2020-01-23 20:41,"Lots of thing can result in the cessation of travel for a period of time: weather conditions, e.g.  

I applaud the Chinese for using this as a preventative measure, esp. as we are unsure as to what is going on.

Never touch your face/eyes, nose with your unwashed hands, get enough sleep and exercise, stay hydrated.  Do the masks actually help?  They might prevent air-borne droplets from getting into various ""cavities.""  Don't eat snake meat (BTW can the virus be destroyed by cooking?"

You'd think that of all organizations, the WHO would understand how quickly a pandemic can and does occur.  Waiting 10 days to meet again and reevaluate this outbreak is negligence at best, condemning more to death at worst."

2020-01-23 20:41,"I don't think that the Chinese have put millions of people under quarantine and restricted the travel of millions more in order to be good global citizens by containing this novel virus. Instead they very well may have a big problem on their hands that the government  doesn't want to reveal because it thinks that it would reflect badly on China. I think that they have under-reported the number of cases and deaths that they are dealing with, just as they underreported SARS, and underreport other health problems, such as HIV in China."
2020-01-23 20:46,"A human pandemic and economic collapse would be good for the other creatures on the planet, and in fact actually may buy humans a few more years on the planet.

2020-01-23 20:47,"While it'd be too much to expect from our Administration and our mainstream media that view China as our adversary, we -as well as the rest of the international community- ought to express our hope that this viral outbreak will have minimal impact on the Chinese people and others that may get infected.

The Chinese government seems to take extraordinary measures to prevent the spread of this virus, and we should all be cognizant that it's doing so. Enough with the snark and sniping...and let us all wish the best of outcome to China. Hopefully, our own medical experts in contagious disease (CDC et al) will offer assistance and expertise. These are the right things to do...it's the American way."
2020-01-23 20:24,"Suspected cases being reported from all over now.

Five persons in quarantine in Glasgow, Scotland - another quarantined in Belfast N. Ireland. Test results awaited. All of them Chinese with h/o recent travel to the Wuhan area.

Most of these suspected cases will turn out to be something else, common colds, simple respiratory viruses - parainfluenza and the like. But, this sort of global panic phase always occurs.

It has a name here - 'WN co-V' (novel coronavirus from Wuhan). If you don't understand something, give it pseudoscientific name. Makes everyone feel more in control."
2020-01-23 20:06,"The W.H.O., the same people who lied about vaping, says not to worry about the Wuhan coronavirus. Why should I believe them? Likewise for the C.D.C."
2020-01-23 22:00,"The PRC is a lying and dishonest autocratic regime. I certainly hope the WHO is not relying on the statistics provided by the PRC. If it says 19 people have died, the real number is probably closer to 100."
2020-01-23 22:20,"The ""æ"" sound is unique to American English so the actual pronunciation of Wuhan should be closer to Wu Ha-en. In which the ""U"" sounds more like the U in German such as in ""Universität"". And ""Ha"" is closer to the one in ""Hannah"" or Han solo. The vowel in ""en"" is close to the one in ""emm.."". 
The numbers for confirmed cases released by local authorities only reflect a fraction of actual ones some of them are very dire. Since censorship comes with a finite reaction time, there is still valuable transient information such as photos/videos which can be spotted on social media, from which one can deduce there is significant lack of hospital beds. Many patients who has virus pneumonia couldn't be ""confirmed"" owing to the lack of beds and testing kits and are therefore turned back to stay at home (self-isolation) and are therefore not counted."
2020-01-23 22:20,"The UN and its WHO serve Chinese political interests, not the health interests of the world, especially not the highly developed world.

We need to take charge of our own health protection and immediately institute an absolute ban from entry to the US of all non-US citizens coming from China or who have been in China in the prior 30 days.  Where is Trump?  Why is he dithering?"
2020-01-23 22:43,"Many people are wearing masks, but respectfully suggest they should also be wearing gloves."
2020-01-23 22:46,"Reporting should include investigation into the public health practices in China, particularly in view of the fact that many concerning viral contagions have originated there (SARS, bird flu, etc...) and are associated with animal reservoirs in contact with humans."
2020-01-23 22:12,"There is next to no data so far to determine whether this is serious or overblown.  Every year, flu is more deadly and nobody cares, because it is not reported that prominently.

What we need to know is how many people are actually infected, but are non-symptomatic.  For that we need effective high-throughput detection methods, which are currently not yet available.  If 100% of infected individuals become symptomatic and 3% of those die, then, yes, this would be worrisome, provided transmissability is also high.  For instance, for chickenpox transmissability is nearly 100%, i.e. someone comes into contact with an infected person, that person get's sick, too.  On the other hand, if transmissability is low, the virus will burn itself out using proper isolation methods.  Incubation period is another issue, then the infectious period, i.e. if the virus is only infectious while a person is also symptomatic, it makes it feasible to contain it through easy detection.

And so on.  At the moment, this looks less serious than the regular flu, but could change, of course.

That's why the WHO did not declare an emergency.  At the moment, the emergency is in people's (and writers) heads."
2020-01-23 23:03,"In China and other countries too, consumption of ""exotic"" wildlife, freshly killed, often uncooked, has a long tradition.  Today we read about snakes and bamboo rats as possible carriers of this current virus and both consumed especially by those who believe doing so has health benefits.  Since this practice has gone on since ancient times, outbreaks like this have likely occurred previously.  This one is dramatized by instant communication and world-wide jet travel.  The beliefs about the benefits of consuming such creatures will persist, assuring the periodic return of widespread illnesses like this in the future."
2020-01-23 23:07,"Any mass-death event of humans is much more likely from a immune resistant pathogen than from climate change. If the Chinese give a number of fatalities you probably need to square it to get the truth.  Governments tend to lie, but China pretty much takes the prize."
2020-01-23 23:50,"It's clear there are no reliable figures on number of ill individuals and number of deaths. The Chinese government has not learned the most important lessons from the SARS and MERS outbreaks -- the importance of a defined and well-funded public health infrastructure throughout the nation, but particularly focused on large cities. China is fortunate to have many dedicated excellent scientists, but it's also clear they do not have a way to influence decision making and the planning of strategies for containment and care. It is horrible to think of the poor Chinese citizens who wait for hours to be examined and diagnosed only to be sent away with platitudes and without proper testing. Shameful way to treat their citizens, actually."
2020-01-24 0:43,"I read up on this virus.  Genetic sequencing found it to be almost the same virus that caused a SARS outbreak in about 2002, that also spread out of China.   That outbreak alarmed people because leaking plumbing and the fact the virus is shed in feces caused many people in Hong Kong patient 1's building to become infected, but this wasn't initially realized and it caused panic.   

But this virus is in the middle of jumping from an animal host, and not actually very infectious under normal circumstances.  It normally spreads slowly and is easily contained by scrupulous public health measures.

In the early 2000s, the virus actually spread to Toronto, Canada, which ended up pretty much quarantined, no travel into or out of the city, but only about 30 people there ever got sick, many of them those who treated the initial patient.  It never spread elsewhere in North America.   

There isn't going to be an epidemic.

But, to be sure, I wouldn't want to take a plane out of China or Hong Kong right now.  Small danger of that, I've taken a plane anywhere four times in my 63 years of life."

2020-01-24 0:31,"Is this virus a world-wide health emergency? I don't know. In the past I would never have questioned a decision by the WHO, but that was before I knew that China was now successfully blocking Taiwan's full participation in the organization, because the island nation does not acquiesce to be ruled by the dictatorial CCP, which claims it is a 'renegade province'. What is more important, people's health, or the CCP agenda? The WHO, a UN organization, seems to think the latter.  So, again, I ask, is this virus a world-wide health emergency?"
2020-01-24 1:03,“There have been millions and millions of Chinese-Americans but zero American-Chinese” said Chinese author Eric Liu of Harvard.

2020-01-24 1:37,"I think the media is reporting this virus in a way that is causing unnecessary fear.  They are not giving enough context.  The people who have died so far were older and already ill.  I feel this should be emphasized more - rather than focusing so much on every new case and where it is spreading.  I also think they should be focusing a lot more of the death rate compared to the flu as well as the fact that the reported cases are only from those who were sick enough to go to the hospital in the first place.  There could be 1000s of people who had the virus and just thought it was a cold so never went to a doctor - which would bring the death rate down even further and make the virus even less serious.  I understand it could mutate and turn into something much more dangerous and think it is good that governments are monitoring it. However, as it is right now, I think the media is causing a lot of unnecessary fear by sensationalizing it and not adding more context into the reporting."

While I am the first person to acknowledge the importance of investigative journalism, there is no means by which your correspondent could work with contacts outside of the area given that little is known about the etiological agent at this stage? Why do I feel like this is a bad plot tangent in an 'outbreak' fiction scenario..."
2020-01-24 1:40,"""While the headlines are alarming, health experts cautioned that it was too early to gauge the severity of the outbreak. ""

Yeah, like...the headlines of this very article. Drop the panic."
2020-01-24 2:05,"Are there any non-Chinese authorities allowed to monitor what’s going on? The Chinese government has a history of not being forthcoming about these things and even trying to cover up information. 

In a situation like this, where global health could be out at risk, it seems like officials more focused on transparency and putting health first, above the pride of the Chinese Communist Party, should be in charge."
2020-01-24 2:05,"Ah, the wonderful West where meat comes neatly packaged from supermarkets, no animals having been harmed. Neatly arranged in uniform packets, impossible to map to the anatomy of any living creature, never a tuft of fur or, God forbid, an eye or a face to be seen. The wonderful enlightened West.

The uncivilized Chinese, can you believe it, eat animals that they have seen alive! Yes, alive! They actually kill living animals to eat, not content with packaged meats produced by supermarkets. The cruelty, the barbarity! One commenter yesterday appropriately suggested that some of China's live market vendors should be executed in public, their well deserved punishment televised in high def. 

Seems that many an enlightened NY Times reader is no less racist than, well, just about anyone else."
2020-01-24 1:50,"I suspect tighter restrictions for travel to and from China and within China, are too little, too late. I pray the CDC is able to find an antibiotic that is effective against the corona-virus."

2020-01-24 1:55,"The word ""barbarian"" springs to mind when I learned what is sold at these filthy live animal markets for consumption. 
I am disgusted and angry beyond belief. 
The Chinese government is totally responsible for this coronavirus because they turn a blind eye to these venues. 
I can't describe how I feel about the human suffering and the misery caged live animals endure because a Chinese person wants to consume a bat infected civet cat, which is how the first SARS virus started. 
Doctors don't know which animal was involved in this one.
No one holds the Chinese accountable. 
No one."
2020-01-24 2:04,The rising death toll in China due to the Wuhan Corona viris (WCV) is alarming. All the China has locked down travel out of Wuhan and surrounding areas more prevention needs to be done for people trapped in the Wuhan epicenter as hospitals are overwhelmed and the sick are not promptly cared for.
2020-01-23 16:34,"Mix a dense overpopulation of people with the consumption of all sorts of live, exotic wild animals, and we can expect this sort of thing to happen on a fairly regular basis. This is what happens when you don't refrigerate meat—the animal and virus is kept alive and quickly consumed. In Asia they often don't have ice or refrigeration, and so people prefer their animals alive and fresh no matter how cruel the practice is. I've seen pictures of 6-8 dogs crammed into a wire cage that fit on the back of a motorcyle....off to the live meat market."
2020-01-23 19:56,This seems to be so far away. When really it's not. This is not to be underestimated. It's necessary to properly refrigerate meat otherwise the virus is kept alive and the chance of consuming it unwittingly is high. This seems to be so far away. When really it's not. This is not to be underestimated. It's necessary to properly refrigerate meat otherwise the virus is kept alive and the chance of consuming it unwittingly is high.
2020-01-24 2:31,"The articles I’ve read about this disease so far do not emphasize even the most basic ways to prevent transmission of a respiratory virus: please cover your mouth with your elbow or a tissue if you have to cough or sneeze. Yes, wash your hands thoroughly and often. And wearing a mask may help protect you and the others around you. But please cover your mouth with your elbow or a tissue (not with your hands) if you need to cough or sneeze. One uncovered sneeze could contaminate a number of other people in a car, bus, train, plane or office. Someone sneezing or coughing in their hands and then touching an armrest, stationary pole or grocery store cashier touchscreen could contaminate them instantly. The experts say people can be contagious even before symptoms appear. Yet why are there no signs in all public conveyances and public places urging people to cover their mouth with their elbow or a tissue if they have to cough or sneeze? Free packets of tissues and hand sanitizers could be placed in all transportation stations and public places and in planes, trains and buses. I’d like to see the disease experts weigh in on how effective such a public health campaign might be."
2020-01-24 2:44,The world cannot believe the same Chinese leaders who regularly hide truth if it serves their purposes. This must be treated as a health emergency.
2020-01-24 3:04,"The CDC doesn't seem to think that the 2019 flu vaccine was too effective.
The overall effectiveness of last flu season's vaccine was only 29% because it didn't protect against a flu virus that appeared later in the season, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
That means that 70% of the people who got the flu vaccine in 2019 didn't benefit from it.

If you think that this means that it wasn't worth getting a flu vaccine then you agree with the CDC.

We can't argue with the figures.

The flu vaccine of 2019 didn't work and, in my opinion as a physician, should not have been used by medically risky populations and anyone who has had any sort of reaction to the vaccine in the past."
2020-01-24 3:02,"What price globalisation now? And is it a price worth paying? All those stuffy international flights, all those crowded airports.

Are we sure that the western world - the WHO and the rest of us - will we react as quickly and effectively as the Chinese have in cancelling flights and shutting down almost all public transportation?"
2020-01-24 3:09,Why is the New York Times sending a journalist to the epicenter of the virus outbreak? I’m honestly curious if you think he is somehow immune.
2020-01-24 3:18,Over 30k+ people a year on average die from the flu.  Why is this virus causing more alarm?  Even the SARs epidemic is estimated to have killed only 800 people worldwide.
2020-01-22 11:38,Clearly the virus is mutating and we hope it does not become more lethal. Earlier reporting indicated that wild animals were illegally sold in that market in Wuhan. The close proximity to humans and poultry and animal farms in Asia is extremely worrisome. This may not be the worst pandemic yet to emerge. Avian flu would be the one to fear. I hope more money is invested in developing Antiviral agents. The remarkable progress that was made in managing Ebola virus should give us hope.
2020-01-22 11:42,"How unprepared would the world be if a kind of ""walking dead"" scenario really came to be? Not with zombies, but simply if an unstoppable, fast, contagious and deadly virus (maybe the result of some amateur genetic splicing experiment gone horribly wrong) were to spread without control from highly populated areas to the rest of the world? 

I think an apocalyptic scenario with the complete and rapid collapse of civilization is something that must be considered a real possibility."
2020-01-22 11:48,"The ""good news"" is China and world health organizations are on top of this much faster than with SARS and various bird flu outbreaks.   When citizens and health care workers are on high alert earlier it can help slow/lessen the spread.  It absolutely warrants vigilance and more research, but I don't think we need to stockpile Alec Jones' survival buckets in our basements quite yet."
2020-01-22 12:05,"This began in exactly the same way as SARS, at these live-animal markets, which are clearly the perfect petri dishes for these viruses, not to mention spectacularly cruel and an incentive for wildlife trafficking. Which begs the question: Why does the Chinese government not shut them down permanently?"
2020-01-22 12:09,"Well to quote the Gipper, ""Here you go again"".   Let's hope countries and the WHO have learned from the previous cases.  While I understand the desire to be carnivorous, this is clearly yet another reason to shift our diets to more plants and fewer animals.  These diseases continue to originate from animals used for food."
2020-01-22 12:23,"Why are people standing in line for the test?  When I flew into Beijing during SARS years ago, medical people came onto the plane and held some contraption near our foreheads while we stayed in our seats. They were checking for elevated temperatures. I assume someone with a fever wouldn’t have been allowed off the plane without an escort. That smartphone-like device shown in the picture could be used the same way."
2020-01-22 12:38,"Before anybody panics, do the following:

1-Carefully monitor it and see how much of a threat it is. 

2-Develop a vaccine for it and take other precautions.

3-Last but not least don't either turn it into a panic if it is not and don't let our de facto criminal drug industry push a useless vaccine/procedure/test on us like they do with many other medical issues."
2020-01-22 12:44,"The foods we eat are meant to sustain us, if they instead pose a threat, a change is sensible and necessary.  The scale of consumption of animal protein is that threat.  Live animal markets, huge portions of our favorite animal meal is that threat.  These epidemics threaten large groups, while daily consumption of animals in individuals brings cholesterol and triglycerides, creating cancers, heart disease, and high blood pressure.  An important variable in climate change is directly traced to the consumption of animals for protein.  With the ever increasing human population, we are fortunate that through technology we may create protein that replaces animals and benefits our climate.  Cultural practices will have to modify and Nationalisms that brings isolationism and mistrust must end if we are to address an avoidable threat."
2020-01-22 12:58,"The smartest move would be to immediately ban all travel to and from China except on an emergency basis.  People today don't wash their hands enough especially after using the bathroom.  And, an airplane is a pressure cooker full of germs.  The airlines refuse to use fresh air in the cabins and instead recirculate it, even though it would only add 25 cents per passenger.   If they don't ban travel then the FAA should order all airlines to immediately use fresh air and not recirculate the cabin air."
2020-01-22 13:12,"As bad as this virus seems, in what way is it really different from a bad case of the flu or pneumonia? The people at risk of dying are mostly the elderly and children, and there don’t seem to be more severe symptoms like those found in something like MERS or one of the perennial diseases like malaria or TB. 

It seems to me like this media coverage is getting out of hand. Obviously health professionals should and are take this seriously, but if we had this same energy and passion for diseases that kill hundreds of thousands of poor people across the world each year then maybe we would make progress in fighting those battles. 

But then again, it’s poor people who are dying from those diseases, so why would they care?"
2020-01-22 12:11,"We read almost daily about billions invested in AI, space tech, military technology, etc. But with looming crises like climate change or pandemics, we learn these organizations are underfunded and unprepared. AI isn't going to matter if half the world is dead."
2020-01-22 12:44,"These viruses always seem to come from these live animal and meat markets. 
It’s time to shut them down."
2020-01-22 12:53,"If the WHO drags its feet on declaring a health emergency, dozens or hundreds will die while tens of thousands more get infected. At what point is this dire enough to take seriously?"
2020-01-22 11:39,"Like it of not, illnesses like these are a direct result of the planet warming due to the obsessive burning of fossil fuels and the extinction of animal  species. Viruses mutate and if their host population is no more , they find another.
Not to found like Cassandra here, but there are viruses that will make Ebola look like the common cold.
But we don’t worry about that because climate change is a big hoax dreamed up by the Chinese according to our Great Leader."
2020-01-22 11:43,"They are so slow. There will be panic if it hits NYC. Not only should they make their declaration all flights should be suspended immediately with full refunds . 
Are they waiting for 100 to die."
2020-01-22 12:06,"China clearly has no desire to prevent the consumption of wild animals. 
The SARS infection came from humans eating bat infected civet cats. 
I find this shocking from an animal rights standpoint but it makes me angry that China allows these practices knowing full well that pandemics can and will continue to develop as a result. 
China boasts it's new prosperity and leadership in the world while their local law enforcement looks the other way as these abhorrent live animal markets do business, creating pandemics and causing untold misery for trapped wild animals. 
Disgusting.  
China is already responsible for having to slaughter at least a quarter of all pigs on the planet due to their slow response to swine fever. Think about that. 
The communist big wigs sit at their cherry wood tables in their air conditioned board rooms and ignore the consequences of their non action at a global level. 
These filthy markets are allowed to flourish in villages across China which potentially could kill millions yet authorities ignore them though they are a proven sources of disease."
2020-01-22 11:40,Nice to see concern about a virus from China which has killed nine people.  Would be good if US political leaders cared as much about epidemics in the US which kill tens of thousands annually-gun violence and opiates.
2020-01-22 13:11,The caption to the picture says that the device detects the presence of the corona virus. Obviously the device measures passengers’ temperatures.
2020-01-22 12:34,Are there any scientists left in this administration?
2020-01-22 13:03,Hello from Hong Kong where a bit less than half of us are wearing masks. Every cough and sneeze is louder now. When I use the restroom many people don’t wash their hands.
2020-01-22 13:19,"This one will spread widely, as the human-to-human route seems well established.  Moreover, as a novel virus, there is no historical human immunity that would slow the spread.

The man returning from Wuhan to Washington state is also illustrative:  he had no known contact with the live animal market or any overtly sick individual.  How many others are like him?

The spread of virus to health care workers is worrisome since they of all people should always be observing basic infection control measures, e.g., gloves, masks, hand washing.

The only good news so far is that the case fatality rate may not be as high as first feared."
2020-01-22 13:28,"If you have a compromised immune system, it may be prudent to wear a mask in public places."
2020-01-22 13:44,"An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.

Energy should be laser focused on creating pressure here in the US for measures here to protect Americans.

Measure #1 should be immediate travel ban on any foreign citizens from entering the US if they are coming from China or have been to China within the past 30 days (those who are American citizens should be put on mandatory self quarantine for 10 days with limited necessary movement outside their home).  Also, everyone not covered by the ban who arrives in the US from anywhere outside the US should be screened and temperature tested with mandatory temperature recheck in 5 days and in 10 days.

Wise Americans will do self-help measures like ceasing all non-essential air travel until the infection is under control. Avoidance of other non-essential close quarter mixing with substantial numbers of people is also wise.

There is still chance to keep the disease rare in the US....but only if measures to prevent the disease from entering are immediately taken."
2020-01-22 13:55,"Interesting, that just like Ebola these virus/pathogens come from animals, some are wild animals-their meat eaten by humans. In China they were eating civets cats that had Sars virus that cats got from bats, now -animals eaten that probably had coronavirus, add to it the lack of sanitary conditions like handling of animals and how they are killed etc. Recipe for new pathogens, outbreaks. Similar to what we get with ground meats etc. and E Coli."
2020-01-22 13:30,"The Wuhan virus is identified as in the same family as SARS, even though scientists have said the virus is weaker than SARS, we should stay alert that this virus might have severe impact to global health like SARS does in 2003, everyone including the World Health Organization should be staying close attention in this matter."
2020-01-22 13:44,"As others have stated, China should shut down these wild animal markets now, helping to eliminate wild animal trafficking and reducing the chances of a pandemic. It's so simple. 
Saving lives and saving wild life."
2020-01-22 13:31,"The fact that they think this virus came from animals (in a market) but with no clue as to which one is worrisome.  As we continue to fill the animals that we eat here in the US with antibiotics (chickens, beef, pork, turkey) it will continue to make them much less effective in any human.  If climate change does not eventually kill us this will. Do yourself a huge favor, quit eating all meat unless you know exactly where it came from (like your own backyard) but the animal matter is used as fertilizer for our crops so it's creeping into the water supply and the food supply regardless.  We are killing ourselves bit by bit."
2020-01-22 13:44,"Why aren’t people being screened BEFORE getting on a plane and potentially infecting other passengers? Check them again upon arrival, too."
2020-01-22 14:03,The only ' grim reminder' that scientists need is that these microbes are very effective formidable evolutionary fit survival biological infectious foes.
2020-01-22 14:02,"Lack of hygiene and government regulations around selling food at markets is to blame. For all the regulations in China you'd think they'd have more government regulations around food and hygiene. It wasn't that long ago that most of the Chinese pig population got wiped out because of some virus. It's lack of government regulations or corrupt officials not enforcing regulations. Though that doesn't help us in the western world where there are strict food and health regulations, as it can be spread from human to human."
2020-01-22 13:58,"I’m concerned about the statistics that the NYT are reporting about this novel virus. The article mentions that there have been over 400 cases with at least 9 deaths, however the WHO report published yesterday (which is cited in this article) specified fewer than 300 cases with 6 deaths. Where is this heightened number coming from? Is it a difference between confirmed and probable cases? If so, where are the statistics for probable cases coming from?"
2020-01-22 14:04,Why is it that all these viruses seem to start in a China? That’s obviously not an accident at this point after MERS and SARS and now a new virus. Why does China still have open markets with live animals for sale? These are breeding grounds for disease and viruses as we have already seen. One day there’s going to be a virus out of China that’s going to be much more serious because of the deplorable conditions of live animal markets. It’s medieval.
2020-01-22 14:14,"The Chinese need to get their act together and become responsible global citizens. Not only are they destroying the planet through wildlife trafficking, mining and other endeavors, but the country itself is a breeding ground for dangerous viruses like SARS and avian influenza. The global community needs to put more pressure on China to close down these markets and stop the illegal wildlife trade."
2020-01-22 14:23,There is an excellent novel about a family in Ohio surviving a flu pandemic by the writer Carla Buckley.  It is fascinating for anyone who is interested in what could happen with the breakdown of society.  I recommend it.  It is called The Things That Keep Us Here.
2020-01-22 14:23,"I recently attended the CES show in Las Vegas (Jan 6-10) along with 170,000 people from around the world and thousands from China.  It wouldn’t surprise me if that turned out to be a site where people became infected.   The booths were usually close together and people were touching exhibits, taking turns trying new equipment like high tech massage chairs, headphones, etc.  It was a great place to pick up germs."

Last time I flew from Cleveland to New York, a young Chinese woman  burst out coughing on the seat in front of me, and she couldn't stop. I breathed through my shirt sleeve, but it didn't help. In two days I became sick and coughed for a month after..."
2020-01-22 14:57,"Why do all these epidemics seem to start in China. Because, only they have the ability to diagnose them amongst the poorer nations of the world. Hundreds of people are probably dying in India, Pakistan or Africa from various viral diseases with no one being the wiser.

And what to say about comments of China covering up. They had sequenced the genome and released to the world before even 200 patients got sick with symptoms similar to the COMMON COLD."
2020-01-22 14:10,"Not a word about the use of antibiotics, especially in feedstock"
2020-01-22 14:12,"Some common sense tips that need to be implemented on a wide scale to protect against any airborne virus 
1.All public bathrooms must install motion activated ( hands free) water taps, paper towel dispensers, soap dispensers 
2. To stop the spread of virus business must rethink how sick days are recorded   When you catch an airborne virus it should be mandatory that you stay home , you should still be paid and it should not count towards your sick days . The same should be true if your child gets sick, people send their children to school when they are sick because they have no one to look after them. They should be forced to stay home when a child is sick , they will get paid and their sick days and vacation days not affected.
3. American have to get into the habit of wearing masks during flu season , thus cultural hang up must be overcome .
4. No handshakes during flu season 
5. Door handles are responsible for most cases of flu, we need more automatic doors at shopping malls and places of business , 2 way swing doors in and out of bathrooms so you don’t have to grab a door handle 
6. By law you must cover your mouth when you cough or sneeze and should get a fine if you don’t 
All of this is serious business , the flu by itself kills thousands every year , we should have implemented ideas like this long ago , but there is no time like the present to start moving in the right direction before something much worse comes along ."
2020-01-22 15:15,"Chinese government informed WHO (World Health Organization) on Wuhan virus very early, and is working closely with the organization. 

Chinese domestic containment is easier to do.  The problem is that it is getting very close to Chinese Lunar New year, and some of the affected people may have been travelling abroad.  It is harder to prevent spreading.  

On the good side, people travel abroad tend to be wealthier and better educated.  The chances of getting affected should be less.  We sincerely hope that it will not spread widely."
2020-01-22 14:16,"We need to worry about this virus and its chances of infecting the homeless people in the large public encampments that have been allowed by our negligent elected  officials. These people are already living in unsanitary conditions. This could create a public health crisis in those cities. This us the primary reason these encampments should not be allowed to exist. We need to enforce vagrancy laws, illegal drug laws, remove these encampments, and clean up the accumulated waste of dirty needles and feces. We have STANDARDS for hygiene and cleanliness. We need to adhere to these. Otherwise, we are no better than the Chinese with their animal markets."

2020-01-22 14:15,We may criticize the Government of China but please spare a thought for the brave health care workers in China. It seems some of them already got infected. This is exactly what happened with SARS - many healthcare workers died in the epidemic.
2020-01-22 14:23,"Grim reminder indeed. This is a grim reminder that whatever our skin color, spoken language or gender, we are no more than cotravelers on our beautiful but terrible world. That, in the end, we are mortal. Given the brevity of our time and our vulnerability to suffering, does it make sense to create more pain? Should we devise new ways to rain steel upon our enemies or burn them with the nuclear fire of a star, or should we try to make it a little easier for all of us? I was angry when I read the Tower of Babel story as a child. What a cruel and malicious God. Now I see how ridiculous it is that a species capable of reaching Heaven might be derailed by an obstacle as inconsequential as differences in language. Let this be a wake up call. Let's use our powers for Good."

2020-01-22 15:24,"What I’d like to know is if this virus is really more serious or lethal than influenza? 

The government of Canada reported that every year worldwide seasonal influenza epidemics cause:
1) I billion cases of influenza

2) 250, 000 to 500,000 deaths

3) 3 to 5 billion cases of severe illness

To me influenza is a disease not to be taken lightly. And yet so many people walk around oblivious to how serious it can be to the point of refusing to get a flu shot.

At the same time, the very same people seem to be panicking and pointing fingers when a “new” serious virus appears.

Overall, I believe we should do what we can to prevent the spread of all viruses regularly rather than looking around for individuals or groups that may be responsible for spreading a newly evolved virus."

2020-01-22 15:40,"Judging from the comments, most people do not understand what a pandemic is, how and why they occur, and what makes them so deadly.  A lot of false beliefs - the NYT really should do a better job of explaining why the CDC and WHO are so concerned."
2020-01-22 15:41,We need a visa ban on China. There's too many Chinese attending American universities as it is.
2020-01-22 15:49,"I'm just not impressed.  So far this sounds like it's not as bad as SARS, and in the end, SARS was completely unimportant.  Around 800 dead, worldwide, is nothing at all.  This one, with 17 dead in a nation of 1.4 billion, is still at the level of nothing at all.

I know people like to get terrified about this kind of thing, but I'm inclined to dismiss it as hype until the number of fatalities gets up into the thousands, which in all likelihood it will not.

What we really need to save the planet from humanity's overpopulation is a Spanish Flu type of pandemic, only more effective.  We desperately need humanity's numbers to be trimmed or we are going to see over a million species go extinct, and large swaths of the planet will become uninhabitable.

Unfortunately this virus is not that pandemic, there is no reason to get our hopes up yet.  But if we're lucky, a really devastating plague will come along before too long, and save us from ourselves."
2020-01-22 16:08,"From the World Health Organization website:

“For communities, inadequate shelter and overcrowding are major factors in the transmission of diseases with epidemic potential such as acute respiratory infections, meningitis, typhus, cholera, scabies, etc. Outbreaks of disease are more frequent and more severe when the population density is high.”

Overpopulation solves itself.   Basic science."

But we don't and shouldn't need any evidentiary support for a travel ban.  A ban absolutely cannot hurt and probably (though not certainly) will help.  The only real question is how much it will help.

Americans have absolutely no right to enter any foreign country.  We can do so only when that country extends us the courtesy....and it can revoke that courtesy at an time, even arbitrarily.

Similarly, foreigners have absolutely no right to enter the US.  They can do so only when we extend them the courtesy....and we can revoke that courtesy at an time, even arbitrarily.

""The virus is thought to have originated in bats and spread to civet cats that were being sold for consumption."" 

Could it be that those other people don't eat civet cats and other exotic animals for entertainment? They might eat whatever they can catch when they are hungry enough, but they don't have huge markets full of them, for sale to people who can afford to eat other things.

I'll bet you won't find bungee jumping pigs in those other countries either."
2020-01-22 15:47,"China has to do a far better job regulating sanitary conditions in these animal markets.  They must be shut down if they don’t meet minimal sanitary conditions, before these problems arise.  Easier said than done, but a necessary and logical step."

But now China is imposing an intra-China travel ban on its own people.  Will our infallible ""professional epidemiologists"" wage their campaign against Chinese protecting themselves?"
2020-01-22 17:45,There are several comments here suggesting that this is not that serious particularly compared to influenza cases each year. It was in fact Influenza which caused the pandemic in 1918. The Spanish Flu was particularly virulent and aided in it's spread by soldiers in close proximity in the trenches of WWI. Some suggest that numbers of deaths should be the barometer of measurement. But that is not why WHO and CDC are concerned. It is the ability of viruses to mutate rather quickly that can trigger a pandemic. It can change both in virility and speed and it's ability to spread from each host. This is a new virus and that is the key. Once it can spread easily between hosts and virility increases it changes exponentially.
2020-01-22 17:16,"Responsible coverage of this ""epidemic"" would contextualize the risk. Compare the number of infections and deaths in China and the US due to Coronavirus vs. the number of infections and deaths in the same time period due to the flu. Is the story still so interesting?

This story has ""legs"" because of people's heightened concerns around travel over the Chinese New Year, because of the perceived strangeness of animal-human transmission, and because of generalized ignorance and racism toward all things China. 

Disclosure: My whole family just spent a month in China, with a day's layover in the viral hotbed of Japan. Spent the day at home with my 3 year old yesterday, who had a respiratory infection, a cough, and a fever, oh no. Spending the day at home with him again, fever gone, robust appetite, singing songs and climbing the walls. Neither me nor my wife -- a physician and surgeon -- are particularly concerned by what's in all likelihood the common cold or flu."

That's an infection rate of 1 case per 3,000,000 people. 

You'd have to get to the point where 13 million people are infected in China to reach an infection rate of even 1% of the population. 

Far more people are catching common colds each day and/or getting the regular flu than are being infected by this virus."

2020-01-22 17:46,"With the potential development of ""super-spreaders"" with this infection, as occurred with SARS and MERS, the importance of the immune system in combating this and other illnesses may be reemphasized. ""It is possible ... that super-spreaders had received a high dose of the virus and had more of it to transmit. Alternatively, their immune systems might have not been able to control the virus, allowing it to multiply and spread extensively in their bodies, making them contagious."" Thus, the aged, with less efficient and effective immune systems, may be specially targeted by this virus. Also, pneumonia vaccinations may act to help protect  the elderly against some of the opportunistic infections that probably accompany this virus.

We imagine it's just a matter of finding the source of a disease and then the cure to counteract it. We have only to look at what the overuse of antibiotics has done to enable the rise of antibiotic resistant bacteria to see where this is all heading.

Our atmosphere,  our waters, and our earth are rife with our refuse. We have changed the building blocks that made life on this earth possible and we wonder why life is becoming impossible.  And yet we won't change. We still think we can bargain our way out of the mess we have caused. 

Sorry. Mother Nature could care less about what we think. We are facing a reckoning that will restore the balance of nature (remember that term from grade school?) without prejudice. Nothing personal. Better luck next time. And if we do get that lucky, maybe we could get over our delusions of grandeur and accept our true place in the universe.

The ghost that haunts all world health organizations is the one of 1918. Anyone who has studied that outbreak (and no one is claiming this is akin) knows how seriously we have to take any outbreak that demonstrates the potential for people to people spread. 

I trust those in the field who have repeatedly warned that it is a matter of when not if we have another major pandemic. There is no cost in taking precautions but the *potential* for devastating consequences if we do not is great.

2020-01-22 20:18,"Why is this news? Why do we have some new killer virus/epidemic presented to us as newsworthy each and every year?  

Today it is the Coronavirus, last year it was Ebola, before that it was Zika, SARS, Hantavirus and West Nile Virus. 

Give me a break.

When it comes to mortalities, all these viruses are not even on the JV team...they’re more like a member of the Under 8 year Old Division. 

Coronavirus has led to 17 deaths; Ebola from 2015-2018 has contributed to 37 deaths; zero deaths to Zika (outside of Microcephaly in newborns which appears to be minimal); 813 total deaths from SARS; 42 from the Hantavirus between 2015-2018, and the West Nile Virus causes 130 deaths/ year.

Roughly 60 million people die globally each and every year. All of the above listed viral deaths, while tragic for their families and loved ones, are mathematically close to zero overall.

The virus that is scary, however, is the one that hardly ever gets any press other than the “It’s time for your vaccination” plug.  It’s a virus that killed 80,000 people in the US last year alone. A bug that is responsible for approximately 470,000 deaths globally in 2018. 

Of course, I’m talking about the flu. 

Instead of sensationalizing all of these pee wees as the next Tom Brady, it might behoove us to actually recognize the Pro Bowl virus that exists today and how we will defend against it."
2020-01-22 20:59,"Screening people at airports is useless and its sole purpose is to allow authorities to look like they are doing something. 

It is usually not sick people with fever who carry infections into new places, it is asymptomatic people who are in the incubation period when they travel. Screening at the airport is basically a temperature check to detect passengers with fever. It is childishly simple to defeat this, all it takes is some tylenol and/or ibuprofen taken about 1 hour before your flight lands. 

The only measures that have any chance of working are either a complete travel ban or quarantine of all asymptomatic travelers for a period longer than the incubation period."

During the 2017-2018 season, there were about 900,000 reported cases of hospitalization due to flu in the US, among them 80,000 death occurred, slightly less than 10%. In comparison, the SARS (considered more sever than Coronavirus based on current assessment by virologists) death rate was also about 10%. Of course, in both cases, there might be large numbers of asymptomatic patients recovered (or died but other causes were attributed to the death) without being reported. 

The difference between flu and Coronavirus is that the latter does not have a vaccine yet and the behavior of the virus is not well understood, which cause concerns."
2020-01-22 21:51,"The WHO refused to declare this disease a global health emergency.  They claimed they need more information.  Perhaps they are sincere, or perhaps this is a political decision to serve the economic and political desires of the Chinese dictatorship.

They claim this disease is relatively less infectious than some other milder and less deadly diseases.  That is at least one encouraging piece of news.  But that lesser infectiousness presents us with a wonderful opportunity to isolate and contain the infection by immediately instituting a travel ban.  China has just instituted a domestic travel ban involving only Wuhan.  We don't know how stringent a ban that will turn out to be.  

The US should immediately institute our own travel ban prohibiting entry of all foreign citizens who come from China or have been in China in the 30 days prior to them coming here.  Americans should be strongly discouraged from going to China.  Americans who have been to China and then return to the US should be examined upon return, then examined again in 5 days and at 10 days.  In the interim, returning Americans should self-quarantine and avoid public contact, not being like the selfish, irresponsible, know-it-all NYC doctor who returned from Ebola area and went to restaurants and bowling  while he was trusted to be under self-quarantine."

2020-01-23 0:12,"I read about one of the flu epidemics, maybe during WWI, which was caused by the worst strains being transported because the sickest soldiers were taken out of the field and the ones with milder symptoms and therefore milder versions stayed stationary.

Public interest and tradition must be balanced against market forces. As the distinction between agriculture, pharmaceutical and food production gradually collapses, our once diverse palates risk converging towards a globally determined baseline."
2020-01-23 1:16,"Another reason not to eat meat. The others being better health, less animal cruelty and less environmental degradation. The evidence for this has been around for many years so why aren’t more of us heeding it?"
2020-01-22 21:14,"The outbreak of this incident is, ironically, somewhat related to the trade war ongoing between US and China. 

Because of the trade war, China stopped importing porks from the US. To seek an alternative, they turned to Russia. Unfortunately, Russia has swine fever, so it passed that to pigs of China, which eliminated a large percentage of China's pig stock. The price of pork jumped to several times of its original, coupling that with a taste for game meat, it makes the alternative meat source much more attracting to common people. That encourages the vibrancy and popularity of wild meat market, the source of this virus break. 

On the other side, the Chinese like of meat from live animals, has an interesting health source. Because China has a poor practice of quality control, the chicken you buy isn't guaranteed coming from a healthy chick, or sometimes even a chick, so buying something butchered live at least gives you assurance as to its source.

Though other countries are warning citizens to avoid traveling to Wuhan or China, majority of the Chinese nationals are still out and about, not questioning their government’s ability to protect them against the outbreak. People are shown wearing no masks or protection in crowded areas. 

""My country is very advanced in medicine. I don't need to worry.""
Most people are not concerned at all. Are they in denial? Or are they really this ignorant? Their unwavering trust for the central government demonstrates the power of brainwashing—why the virus will be hard to contain.

8 nationals who shared their concerns about the seriousness of the deadly virus on Weibo were charged for spreading rumors. Now that Wuhan, the entire city, has been put in quarantine, some are finally asking the authority to exculpate the innocent netizens, and questioning the authority’s credibility.

1) China set up tents to quarantine patients infected with SARS.
2) China monitored traveling persons to check for persons with above normal temperatures you would be promptly quarantined as long as a week for observation. 
3) As seen in the Agence France Presse image, they sprayed antiviral disinfectants similar to lysol.
4) Had hand sanitizers all around public places.
5)Almost everyone wore masks that prevented any droplets or aerosols from entering the respiratory tract. I doubt whether free virus particles or virions were trapped by the masks used at that time and they should try using masks with filters that will trap virions. 
6) There was a sports team that was held up in a motel when one person in the group showed high temperature. They were only released after their sporting event was over without their participation.

2020-01-22 17:39,"For some perspective, consider that we are currently talking about 400-500 cases in a country of 1.3 billion people.

More people catch a common cold or the regular flu each day than are getting this virus. 

Or to put it another way, to get to an infection rate of just 1% of the population in China, 13 million people would have to get infected."

China is not an open society and is likely to have repressed the existence of this virus for some time.
Due to the relatively long incubation period of two weeks, many travellers on aircrafts will be asymptomatic and thus will spread this virulent virus throughout the world.

But some of the residents of Wuhan have already fled into different counties in China. Some manifested their desire to find a place where medical resources are abundant, i.e. HK, and a new confirmed case appeared in Hong Kong, taking HSR while our special administrative government have yet to be taken essential precautionary measures that require them to inform the authority about their health conditions.

2020-01-22 20:19,"Wuhan is my home city. I am very worried about my family and friends there. It must be a tough Chinese New Year for people who are impacted by this virus outbreak.

It is a very bad time of the year because most of the people are off work for at least 7 days celebrating the festival with all their family members. Unlike the American family, Chinese families are big, which makes the virus easily to spread. 

Wuhan has 11 million residents and is a major city in China. Many people would get in and out of the city during Chinese New Year, which makes the virus even scarier. 

On one hand, it is shocking to me that the travel ban has been issued in Wuhan. On the other hand, I feel it is effective to stop the virus. Hope CCP is able to figure out a way to cure the virus soon."

Subways are a sight to behold at rush hours in most cities just absolutely packed to capacity, it’s a scary place to have an outbreak of any easily transmissible disease I certainly hope the measures taken work."
2020-01-22 19:49,"Despite the negative comments thus far, one has to admire the ability of the Chinese government to order such drastic measures once the threat became clear.

2020-01-22 20:24,"First of all: this sounds very serious! Secondly: you don't announce such a measure beforehand, you just cut all ways out and THEN you tell the public, probably using words like ""...it's for your own good..."", like someone would believe that.

Therefor I expect a lot of (infected?) people ""got out"" before services stopped. Many of them feared that authorities would be unable to handle a mass-outbreak in a city that big. I think they were right!

The picture with the guy spraying stuff in the train station is more worth than a thousand words. It reminds me of that tent the U.S. woman suspected of carrying Ebola was forced to live in. Total chaos, total confusion, total helplessness on account of the government.

Diseases always trigger emotions in us, we've been conditioned that way for millennia. And yet: we don't have proper procedures in place, we always stumble from first infections to spreading epidemic to barely contained pandemic.

One would think we learn. We don't. Watch the U.S. reaction to this when more patients appear. With Donald Trump at the helm you can expect calm, orderly, logical measures - NOT! But I don't have high hopes for other nations either. I wonder how Angie will tackle it...

Anyway: I'm on sick-leave this week for - can you believe it? - an unknown respiratory illness. I'm alright, and it sure as heck isn't the Wuhan thing, but it gives me time to monitor the situation until Monday morning to see if I go to work or into the bunker :-)"

Any flight ban would be ineffective. It didn't' work with HIV, Ebola, or any other disease. Borders are always porous. It would just change the way ppl travel making it harder to track. Lastly, there could be economic effects that lead to collapse and scarcity of needed resources. Public health is not an excuse for xenophobic. 

Outbreak investigation is fully capable of dealing with the issues. However, we need to fund these activities and collaborate better. The world is interconnected and it requires all of our attention to address any disease."
2020-01-22 21:31,"It will be several weeks before enough information is in to determine how fast and how far the virus is spreading, which demographics are most vulnerable and whether the virus is showing signs of mutation to become more or less severe. In the mean time, actions to contain the virus and reduce the likelihood of transmission can be taken wherever it has appeared. Compared to SARS and MERS, public health authorities seem to have more of a jump on identifying and responding, both locally and globally, than before, so that is some good news already. But if there are already 17 confirmed fatalities, as has been reported, it would not be surprising if this number is doubled or tripled in the upcoming week or two, after which we should hope the containment becomes effective and treatment of those infected more successfull."

The common flu, which kills Americans by the tens of thousands, often has no vaccine or cure. Flu shots are only 50-60% effective in healthy adults, and some people cannot take the flu vaccine at all: <a href=""https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/flu/in-depth/flu-shots/art-20048000"" target=""_blank"">https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/flu/in-depth/flu-shots/art-20048000</a>  

The common flu mutates continuously and unpredictably, sometimes evolving into yet-more-lethal strains. 

The Wuhan outbreak is caused by a coronavirus. SARS is caused by a coronavirus. And the common cold is often caused by a coronavirus. They are all different disease processes with different lethalities.  Comparing one to the other may not be meaningful. 

More study is definitely warranted. China and others should definitely try to limit the spread of this disease, as they've done. But let's not lose our heads with fear. There are common epidemics in our midst right now which may be much more dangerous to the average American."

2020-01-22 21:55,"@Old Expat. There is a very powerful multiplier in today's world and that is air travel. It is not too late to attempt containment. Transnational containment measures can be far-reaching: entry or exit screening, reporting, health-alert notices, collection and dissemination of passenger information, travel advisories or restrictions, and physical examination or management of sick or exposed individuals. These kinds of powers were exercised in Asia and North America during the SARS outbreaks. A variety of sanitary measures is possible at borders and on conveyances, including inspection, fumigation, disinfection, pest extermination, and destruction of infected or contaminated animals or goods. Border protection can severely disrupt travel, trade, and tourism, and it should be balanced against the global economic impact.

Controls placed on international travel can also infringe upon civil liberties. The freedom of movement is a basic right protected by national laws and international treaties, but it is subject to limits when necessary for the public’s health. In particular, some of these limits can present serious risks to privacy. For example, containment measures may require the travel industry to collect and disclose passenger data. Such infringements on privacy rights can be justified only if there is a genuine need to obtain high-quality surveillance data and if the infringements are carried"

The common cold is a type of coronavirus and currently we have no effective treatment for the common cold virus. I read reports about how the outbreak began in an exotic meat market there. (Ebola arose from bushmeat in 2014.) I also read reports that ""Chinese crooks are cornering markets in pigs and pork by using drones to spread swine fever."" I sure hope the closed-information Chinese government is accurately reporting the scale of the problem."
2020-01-22 22:31,"Closing off a city of 11 million people is an enormous move by China, suggesting that authorities may be very anxious about the spread of this virus to a larger population.

2020-01-22 22:18,"I notice this narrative is overlaid with great social projection of the Chinese Communist Party as the caretaker of the country, the use of shame and the party apparatus as the means of control.  The subtext is first, that the Central Party is trying to manage the mid-level elites and professionals in the periphery, to get them to do the right thing, and second, the Chinese people have the will necessary to make great social sacrifices for the greater good.

It's nauseating to see the Chinese Communist Party like a cobra wrapped around the people of China, enabling a million parasite party actors to suck the blood out of every moment of social importance, and inject their venomous nationalism.  The Chinese Communist Party is trying to be God, and father, and protector, and best friend, and the source of pride -- and most of all, the decider of what is true or real or good, for each and every person in China.  

If the Chinese Communist Party wanted this buried, it would be buried.  They want to avoid the disappointment and mistrust that followed their suppression of the SARS outbreak.  If they had a choice of people dying and their credibility, the Chinese Communist Party would do anything save face.

For now, the people of Wuhan have the Chinese Communist Party on their side.  Tomorrow?  Who knows."

Scores of millions of Americans lack medical insurance or have very poor coverage, and this discourages them from seeking treatment when they first become ill, so they aren't isolated and cared for. Many tough it out and keep working or going to school when they may be infectious. In a major epidemic that could have terrible consequences.

I would bet the doctors involved knew better from the start. 
This illness originated from village markets where people are allowed to buy and consume animals of all kinds, wild and domestic, with no government oversight. 
Nothing is done to chastise the Chinese government while the entire world population is put at risk because authorities won't close down these filthy village markets.
It makes me angry. China is not held responsible for their lax behaviors. 
Swine flu in China has caused millions of pigs to be slaughtered because they did not respond quickly enough and this swine disease is moving throughout the globe.

Since WURS (WUhan Respiratory Syndrome) is close relative of SARS, it likely has a similar incubation period of 2-7 days. This means the real number of cases are likely much higher than what has already been reported by the authority. Unfortunately this outbreak coincides with the Lunar New Year, which means we likely will see a rapid increase of new cases in the coming weeks. 

Quarantine of a huge highly mobilized urban city such as Wuhan is not only impractical in terms of logistics, it might result in uncontrolled outflow of panic unknowing patients (without obvious symtoms) to sneak out. Hopefully the authority has learned their lessons from the SARS outbreak and will be better prepared this time around."

But who in their right mind thinks that a government wants to *prevent* panic? Governments thrive on the fear of their people. That's how they've got so much support for shutting off an entire city: people are scared, so they care less about their rights. The Singaporean reaction to SARS should terrify people because it's almost 20 years later and technology has progressed in a decidedly dark direction.

China, I'm surprised to remind us, is an authoritarian dictatorship. They're taking steps towards a genocide of Chinese Muslims. They plaster peoples' faces on public buildings when they break a law so that everyone knows to shun them.

People should be more concerned about the breezy violation of human rights than with a disease which, if it's as bad as SARS, will kill less than 1,000 people. I know, I know: the point is to get out ahead of it, right? But we can't react to every potential pandemic with a quarantine of an entire city.

There are reasonable and effective steps to address this without such a draconian order. It's dictatorial and Americans should know better."
2020-01-23 3:10,"The Sars epidemic was badly mishandled, which allowed it to spread first to Hong Kong, and then to the rest of the world. I was in China during Sars; the first I heard of it was through word of mouth - people spread the news via text messages; there was no media coverage at all. Later, after grudgingly admitting its existence, authorities announced that the disease was a variant of chlamydia and a cure had been found. A laughable explanation. Later, after weeks of media silence in China, news started to appear in international news outlets of the HK outbreak, with speculation of a connection to the outbreak on the mainland, which of course the government denied. 

Eventually, the government and the media, likely because of international pressure, had to admit the reality of what was happening, but by that point the disease had been allowed to spread to many provinces in China and overseas. 

So this time they are at least trying to do something. Most people who are travelling will likely have left by now, and there are probably no (good) train tickets left now anyway, so closing the city now is a bit of a moot point. It is also important to appear to be doing something, otherwise news spreads by anecdote, which undermines trust in the authorities, which the government fears as much as the disease itself."
2020-01-23 1:42,"My mom’s father fled China during the cultural revolution, so maybe she’s biased, but she told me that whenever the CCP reports a number like this, add a zero to the end of it. “Stability and control. That’s all they care about.” This article shows just a slimmer of what happens when China lose even a little control. It loses hundreds of millions of dollars and its citizens have to be locked down."
2020-01-23 1:57,"I lived and worked at a university in Wuhan from 1990 - 1992.  It was my first time in China, it was fascinating, and I became close to several local Chinese people.  It's sad to read about what's happening there now.  I wish everyone in Wuhan well and hope this coronavirus outbreak is stopped real soon before many more people are adversely affected."
2020-01-23 2:17,Army has sealed all roads to Wuhan. They would not do this unless it's very serious.
2020-01-23 3:36,Episodes of contagion are typically only reported once laboratory tests show a precise match between a patient's  sample and the identified high-risk pathogen. The result is often serious underreporting even when agencies and governments have the best of intentions.
2020-01-23 3:15,"Surprisingly to see how many people believe it's an negative action. Obviously, many of those people have no idea about the China's situation. Considering the population and the upcoming Spring Festival, I would say the government made the right decision.

As one of the biggest cities in China and an important transportation hub, you can't even imagine how many people would leave Wuhan with the virus: remember, the incubation period of this virus is about 2 weeks. Those travelers will spread the virus to the other cities of China, and even oversea.

Humanity is not a matter here, guys. It's not the correct time to judge this order and talk about humanistic things. In this case, the Chinese government is not only responsible for China but also to the world. 

I've read many news, comments, and reports these days. A few days ago, many Chinese people have already started to asking the government to block Wuhan away: just as what they did to Beijing during the Sars period. It's a wish of people.

Seriously, do you really want to see it becomes worse? You guys should try to read something from China and find a more objective viewpoint. It's stupid to pretend that you know everything. And don't relate every single piece of information about China with politics, especially your own political belief.

Thank you."
2020-01-23 3:12,"It’s interesting to read the comments re what some perceive to be “draconian” measures employed by the government. When there is no transparency and a poor history of communicating similar events who is to say whether the measures are good, bad or otherwise?  Is it possible that that with the new year holiday travel about to begin this had to happen?  Trying to compare what would happen if you had to shut down this city versus that city is a pointless exercise.  That’s not on the table at the moment.  Containing a virus is."
2020-01-23 3:22,"CDC says 646,000 people die from the flu every year. SARS killed 800 and this one has killed 17."
2020-01-23 3:12,Easy on an authoritarian country.
2020-01-23 3:48,"Each time a new disease emerges, health authorities need to spring into action on the chance that the new disease might be serious.

The media is always eager to spring into action, too, because stories about new things that might be very bad make the most money.

But, for all the rest of us, let's follow common sense health measures (washing hands, getting enough rest, staying home if not feeling well, etc.) and not get preoccupied with worry.

Most likely, this illness is not going to lead to a big pandemic. Just because health workers need to jump on the case and take extra precautions until they understand the disease, it doesn't mean we need to get stressed out!"
2020-01-23 5:10,"Given how the Chinese government has been exerting total surveillance and control over its people (even with its huge population), the virtual incarceration of its Muslim population in Xinjiang as a prevention against sociopolitical unrest, 
the fact that there has been little or no real measures taken until now - 2 months (or more) after the initial known outbreak - is a sign of its continuing failure with public health crises, often preferring good PR to serious health policies.

Meanwhile the virus has crossed borders, and been shown to be contagious from person to person; did they have to wait until Hong Kong determined this ? 

And given the recent history of such viruses, why do they even still allow markets of live, often wild animals ?"
2020-01-23 5:45,"No one I know has been infected but everyone has been staying home and being careful.

Hope they get this under control soon and end the lockdown. The rate at which the situation escalated last few days is surprising. I know some people drove out early this morning right before the restriction took effect and escaped."
2020-01-23 5:50,"What is particular about this virus that the medical community decided to research if it is a new disease? I'm pretty sure if I went to my local urgent care with flu like symptoms, my doctor would not be contacting the CDC to see if I have a new type of virus."
