2021-05-25 14:35,"Thank you NYT, for putting faces on this crisis, reminding us the human toll of this tragedy. I have spent a lot of time worrying about my loved ones back in India.

When all this is over (hopefully soon enough), Indians need to reflect deeply on politics and governance in India. This tragedy of the second wave could so easily be avoided."
2021-05-25 14:18,Thanks for sharing these voices.
2021-05-25 14:37,"Thanks for this coverage, it's badly needed. The devastation occurring in India and Brazil may be the real pandemic story, with everywhere else just being ""throat clearing."". We're talking about, given the massive undecounting, possibly 10s of million of excess deaths. Truly frightening and angering, the Modi and Bolsonaro governments made matters, as Trump did, significantly worse."
2021-05-25 14:18,"Thanks for sharing these voices of strength, struggle, despair and hope. It's all too easy to imagine the US in a similar desperate situation if a things had gone a little differently. I'm with Harmandeep--a bit of slapping needed here, too."
2021-05-25 14:56,"My understanding is India made the terrible decision to first vaccinate administrators and officials instead of the elderly. Then, instead of proceeding with vaccinations in their own country, they began large scale selling and shipping vaccine to Africa. It is not difficult to understand why they are in this situation. I am so sorry the Indian people are having to endure this, and hope they will elect more competent leaders in the future."
2021-05-25 14:51,I wish the ruling party in India had spent money and resources on hospitals instead of temples. I wish they had spent more time preparing the healthcare system than fomenting religious divisions. I wish they hadn’t declared a premature victory over Covid. I wish they had spent more time planning for the surge of Covid than trying to win an election in West Bengal. I wish they would come out of their hideout and lead the country out of this crisis.
2021-05-25 15:47,"According to information from the FDA, as of August 2019, 18 percent of the manufacturing facilities making active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) to supply the U.S. market were in India. The US pharmaceutical industry has come to rely on India and its API production, and it is time for the US to come to the aid of India in dealing with its pandemic problems."
2021-05-25 15:39,"It breaks my heart to see the people suffer so much and yet their photos show smiling faces. I always miss feeling of being at home when I am with Indians. Their ethics and family values are strong. Agree with Harmandeep Khera, the people are rock solid and caring, but goverment is shoddy and needs a tight slap."
2021-05-25 15:25,"I am delighted to read this article which helps to expose the incompetence of Modi who has suppressed the Indian Media and Online criticism of himself and his Government. While Modi was in glee about not seeing anything but people at his Rally the Virus was being spread. While Modi declared that India had beaten Covid and he gave away Vaccines, people where about to be infected.  His lack of transparency and actual hiding of the truth has shown the world what a weak leader he truly is."
2021-05-25 15:47,"As heartbreaking as these stories are, they’re also unbelievably frustrating. Shweta hit the nail on the head. Modi’s government (and the COVID deniers he enables) played dumb all the while knowing EXACTLY what was coming.

It’s not that they didn’t understand the risk.

It’s not that they didn’t realize this was the inevitable outcome of months of lax social distancing and masking.

It’s not that the didn’t have months and months of data to make informed decisions.

It’s that they just didn’t care.

Like Trump, Modi is a self-serving monster and history will remember."
2021-05-25 15:43,"The input of New York Times readers in India is interesting. However, how representative are they of the Indian population? It is likely that the vast majority of Indians are not represented in this story."
2021-05-25 15:24,"Brave Indians, keeping their cool and fighting the deadly enemy on their own. What a tragedy for the families to see their loved-ones parting in such a depressing situation. None of the Covid victims deserved not being provided proper medical treatment and careful attention. Nor did those who were denied their last funeral rituals merited such a send-off but for the high mortality pressure which has made every Indian family forgo their own wishes for the sake of accommodating another fellow citizen, going through a similar ordeal. What could a good human being do, when the system has broken down, leadership is incompetent and the outside support is not forthcoming? Only peoples' goodwill - holding each other together, accommodating as much as one can and waiting for the good days to come."
2021-05-25 14:09,"Thanks for sharing these snippets. I weep for my countrymen but what has emerged is the goodness of ordinary people volunteering, trying to help even total strangers. 
I am ashamed of the leadership in my motherland but I am so proud of my fellow citizens united in a catastrophe of epic proportions."
2021-05-25 15:38,"1.8 Billion People crammed into a land mass less than half the size of America with much of it uninhabitable mountains and such, massive poverty that gives poverty a whole new depressing meaning, total lack of sanitation and real healthcare infrastructure and a pandemic comes to town.

What could possibly go wrong?

The only real surprise is it took this long to go this bad. 

It's going to take years and a LOT of deaths for this to get fixed."
2021-05-25 16:02,"I’ve heard from my Indian Muslim friend, that Indian Muslims are faring much worse, because most of the aid donated to India (under Modi’s Hindu nationalist regime) is going only to Hindus. It’s very sad to hear. They are all Indians, it’s sad that one group is treated so poorly by their own country."
2021-05-25 15:52,"I am so glad that a different, middle class population in India has been showcased. These are educated folks who are trapped due to the vast ignorance propagated by the right wing government. I sincerely hope they get on with producing vaccines and getting it into arms. It is scary to hear about state governments distributing strange herbal concoctions to large covid positive populations. The study is awful, half baked and unscientific. If only people understood the efficacy of masks and hygiene, it would help in the control of covid. I sure hope these bright people helping each other spread this information as the folks in authority sure don’t seem to be."
2021-05-25 16:58,"""The Truth Alone Triumphs - Satyamev Jayate""

Thank you to the New York Times for (finally) shining a light on the courage and humanity of ordinary Indians during one of the darkest moments of our nation's story.

Completely abandoned by a corrupt nationalist government and left to die gasping for air in the most horrific circumstances - ordinary Indian has stood up and said 'enough'.

All over the country, voluntary groups have sprung up to help with food, medical supplies and oxygen. Everyday Indians have shown such grit and bravery, rushing to help family, friends, neighbors and even strangers in their hour of need. 

The stories in this article resonate so much with what I hear everyday from my friends and family in India. 

Indians have also shown great courage in taking to social media to speak out (at great risk to themselves) against Mr. Modi's government and tell the truth about what is happening in India today.

'Satyamev Jayate' is our nations motto and in the end, the truth both bitter and sweet, must prevail. 

Jai Hind!"
2021-05-25 17:02,"It is tempting to blame the only leadership to blame for a natural disaster which has outstripped resources of poor country Under Indian federal system healthcare is mostly a individual state subject  Where the industrialized rich countries like US, Italy,UK , France and Germany well prepared for the onslaught of Covid Panendemic?In the initial period of Panendemic NYC hospital healthcare workers were wearing improvised garbage bags for PPE.India is a poor overpopulated country where successful governments of whatever hue have underfunded the basic healthcare over last 75 years. This problem is compounded by overcrowding in densely populated country where people cannot maintain social distance.Added to this is lack of public sanitation and poor usage of masks 
After one year of panendemic US still is importing massive quantities of PPE and ventilator parts from China every day India does not have the financial resources to do the same"
2021-05-25 17:50,"When, oh when will we learn to vote for that boring candidate who is experienced, competent and honest, who knows how to get things done that will make a real difference in people' lives?"
2021-05-25 19:16,"Thanks for writing this article. These are terrible times to live in India. Almost every other family has been affected by the crisis. With no support from the current leadership, tough days are ahead. The current leadership/administration came to power with false promises and ended up doing exactly the opposite they promised. They are using the COVID crisis as a tool to choke people into submission and further their stronghold on power. Many student activists and leaders are languishing in jails on trumped up charges. Bypassing due process, they have passed many new laws to further their interests. You can look at what is happening in the islands of Lakshadweep to understand their complete lack of regard for the people of the island. All these actions to further the interests of a few business friends. With almost all the national news channels being owned by crony capitalist friends, the opposition has hardly any visibility. From using Pegasus on opposition parties, journalists and activists to letting loose an army of online trolls (with fake profiles) to threaten and abuse - they will do anything to cling on to power. We are a deeply divided nation now - divided by religion, caste and creed. We are barely hanging onto democracy by a thread and we need all your support to cling on."
2021-05-25 18:37,I am always amazed at the resliance of people in India. I think it's people will propel that country will take it out from pandemic and to a better place.
2021-05-26 10:32,"What we read is urban who has twitter access, which likely accounts to 3% ironically equivalent to the people who are vaccinated. As NY times published in other article counts and suffering are 15 times under reported. Remedy - Next time we should mandate the PM should have basic education."
2021-05-26 8:06,"Thank you NYT for giving a voice to the silent , long suffering and patient people in India.
One reason for the complacency and indifference shown by those in-charge - maybe because many of those  dying are poor, diseased ,backward and ignorant(so considered  dispensable)
 And they are not being counted anyway !"
2021-05-24 18:13,"It is nice to see that the gender disparity in COVID death rates is mentioned. That men are up to twice as likely to die from COVID outside Africa is rarely discussed in the mainstream media. The only reason it is mentioned here is because women seem adversely affected.

And the question of whether this higher death rate for men outside of Africa is caused by “barriers to accessing care and limitations or biases in care when critically ill” is NEVER asked. It’s odd, but not that surprising, that the article posits that bias or barriers to care could be an issue in Africa for women, but not in Europe or the US for men.

We should ask these questions."
2021-05-24 19:42,"Imagine if Africa put some serious effort in reducing their unsustainable overpopulation. Eventually, they might find they can actually care for their people and not be overwhelmed."
2021-05-21 11:47,"The Taiwanese authorities and citizens have done a great job together, but it was only a matter of time before the guard would relax from emotional fatigue and the dangerous variants would gain a tiny toehold. Good luck to all of them!"
2021-05-21 11:51,"I am American and just flew back from Taipei to San Francisco on May 19. All the anecdotes are true. When Taiwan hit Level 3 (out of 4) restrictions, everyone voluntarily stayed home and companies large and small made plans to move % of employees to wfm. They balanced opening an economy, all the while giving the freedom for citizens to decide how to be responsible. In Level 3 (as of my leaving) malls, restaurants, and stores were open to the public. Reasonable and responsible way to approach pandemic risks."
2021-05-21 12:13,"No electricity, no water, and no vaccines were the early signs of incoming problems for Taiwan government.

Taiwan faces several monumental problems.  Despite government repeatedly said that everything is fine, Taiwan just doesn't have enough electricity generating capacity to satisfy the summer demands of power usages.  They limit the power usage in certain non-important residential areas. The current weather brings no rain that further deepening the hydropower shortages.    Both farmers and chip manufacturing need plenty of water to keep functioning and surviving. But the government chose chips over rice.

China offers its Sinopharm and SinoVac vaccines to help. 
But Taiwan under the current leader offers silent response. Fortunately, Taiwan got a little bit of AstraZeneca vaccines for temporary relief.  With this small quantity, it won't solve or stop Taiwan's Covid-19 resurgence any time soon."
2021-05-21 12:23,"I'm not worried about Taiwan. As we've seen over the past nearly year and a half, the Taiwanese government and its citizens are responsible. They'll get this under control in no time."
2021-05-21 12:55,"Taiwan loses control of the virus. If 300 daily cases among 24 million people doesn’t sound like much, it’s enough of a start to become 30000 a day within a month or two. And it won’t matter how they’ve done a superb job the whole time; Covid is like the proverbial past performance with investments. But we’ve had so much blaming and shaming when really it’s just the nature of this virus. It’s madly contagious, like the “Hong Kong flu” I remember everyone seemed to be getting when I was young, except deadlier."
2021-05-21 13:45,The government should have made sure its citizens were vaccinated.  Spraying disinfectent is a foolish waste of money.
2021-05-21 23:20,"To be frank, vaccination wasn't really available to the general public. It was set aside for different group levels/priority groups/special needs. Many countries set out on the vaccination race, and Taiwan was another country that invested in it and still is. (Which is possibly one reason why there has been a lax attitude with acquiring/securing more outside vaccines.) We enjoyed months of not having to really worry about covid. Yet here we are,   ""1% vaccinated"" now begging for vaccines. So much research and data out there about Covid, and yet certain personnel were given shorter and shorter quarantine days. There's a lot more to say. But ultimately, the ball was dropped. It's now time for us to experience what the rest of the world has/is dealing with. So mask up, wash your hands,  and reduce exposure."
2021-06-02 14:01,"The Chinese are not to blame for the COVID epidemic, despite the best efforts of Trump to blame them.
But President Biden is correct to request that US intelligence agencies conduct a thorough, non-political investigation into the origins of COVID.  This is not an effort to blame China, but rather to determine how to prevent the next pandemic from getting started.
We cannot assume that it will be 100 years for the next pandemic.  With the larger world populations encroaching on remaining animal sanctuaries, once every 10 years would be more likely, if we don’t have a continuing worldwide effort to prevent it."
2021-06-02 14:03,"When the Chinese authorities seem to be exerting influence to bend the investigation, it is hard to not suspect something nefarious. A transparent report, even if it concludes that we don't know, goes a long way toward educating the public about the process of scientific investigation. Thank you President Biden for your service to the people of the world."
2021-06-02 14:12,"“At the end of this process, I would not be surprised if we did not know much more than we know now,” 

And what do we know now? We know that the NIH funded the work in Wuhan despite restrictions on such funding endorsed by the community. We know that Wuhan carried out some or even much of its work in labs with only low safety standards, despite the need for, and availability, of labs with the highest standards.

In short, we know prudent and well known restrictions upon enhanced function gene experiments and their funding were ignored or circumvented, despite community agreements about funding and exercise of such work.

This hubris might not be the cause of this outbreak, but it certainly could have been. And this behavior in Wuhan and in the NIH has to be curbed now!"
2021-06-02 14:43,"The animal-to-human origin hypothesis is not as ""straightforward"", as Dr. Garry asserts. There are genetic sequences in this virus that are more easily explained as being of laboratory origin, than the wild. That China has aggressively resisted exploring the lab origin theory is also a huge red flag."
2021-06-02 14:46,"It really does not stretch one's imagination too far to consider that a lab which studies coronavirus, and which just happens to be in the epicenter of the outbreak, might have something to do with it."
2021-06-02 14:54,"Certainly it doesn’t require too much imagination. And that is exactly the problem. More than imagination is required since this is an argument from silence. In the world of science it would be unusual if such research were going on and nobody knew about it. 

The assumption should still be that an animal source is the most likely explanation. At least while the evidence is not there."
2021-06-02 14:55,"Even if they have access to all the evidence it often takes the NTSB years to reach a conclusion on the causes of an airline accident. Now, in 90 days with limited cooperation we are, somehow, to determine definitively the source of the virus. They’re scientists, not magicians. 90 days isn’t even enough time to gather evidence much less draw a conclusion unless they’re incredibly lucky or someone already has the answer. I too doubt we’ll know a lot more in 90 days than we do now."
2021-06-02 15:39,"This article notes that there’s no direct evidence for the lab leak theory, but fails to also point out that there’s no direct evidence of an intermediate host for a spillover event despite China having tested over 80,000 animals within the last 18 months. It’s in China’s best interest to show that a spillover event took place and it’s been unable to do so. It’s very much against China’s interests to provide evidence of a lab leak. With every passing month, a spillover event becomes less likely and there’s a mountain of circumstantial evidence in support of a leak that continues to grow."
2021-06-02 15:56,"What conclusive evidence is there for the wet market theory? None. We can’t rule out any plausible theory at this time, I think is the point. CNN and various other main stream news organizations called the lab leak theory a “conspiracy theory” at the time while they had no justification to say anything except that the lab leak thought is a realistic possibility that we can’t confirm or deny at this early stage because the Chinese government is denying access and transparency to critical data that would be material to a conclusion. And that continues to be where we are today. We can’t definitively say yes or no and it therefore on the table along with the wet market idea. Period."
2021-06-02 15:32,"The Wuhan virus lab, AKA biological weapons facility, is just another benefit of the Made in China label."
2021-06-02 15:26,"""A number of researchers remain unpersuaded by the possibility of a lab leak. “This pathway remains the least likely of all for the origin of COVID-19,” said Peter Daszak, a virologist at EcoHealth Alliance who has worked frequently with the Wuhan virologists.""

To Peter Daszak. You can fool all the people some of the time, and some people all the time. But you cannot fool all the people all the time."
2021-06-02 14:50,"It's ironic that any discussion regarding Wuhan Institute of Virology was thwarted because Trump tooted the ""China virus"" horn. Like the parable of the boy who cried wolf often and inappropriately, a Trump utterance has lost any credibility, automatically crippling his agenda.

It's tough to govern when few believe you."
2021-06-02 15:40,"“In the beginning, there was a lot of pressure against speaking up, because it was tied to conspiracies and Trump supporters,” said Akiko Iwasaki, an immunologist at Yale University. “There was very little rational discussion going on in the beginning.”

At least we can thank Trump for exposing the biases of formally trusted experts and media."
2021-06-02 14:14,"It's a relief that President Biden has called for further investigation. It signals that he's willing to stand up to China without the dangerous diatribes of ConDon.
 China's petulance about this issue and so many other issues that play out on the world stage is disturbing.  It wants all the benefits of international commerce without the responsibilities. It is a consistent purveyor of misinformation about its activities relative to COVID19, including undercounting its deaths and overstating the efficacy of its vaccine.
It seems that the bigger picture is that, whether from a lab leak or a ""wet"" market, COVID19 arose in China.  As good citizens of any country, we get vaccinated to protect ourselves and our communities.  As a good citizen of a global community, China should do the equivalent of the ""right thing."" It should shut down the live animal markets that could be the ongoing source of deadly viruses and develop alternate sources of protein and revenue for its people.  If it can control birth rates, it can do this, too. It should also allow a thorough investigation of the lab leak possibility.  By refusing to do this, it gives the impression of guilt."
2021-06-02 16:00,"As for Mr Daszak and his skepticism,  didn't his organization actually fund studies at the lab designed to create these viruses? And he also tried to throw everyone off track with the Lancet article early on without mentioning this conflict ? Seems like quoting him without mentioning these facts is misleading at best."
2021-06-02 16:47,"It took 15 years to find the animal origin of SARS-1, I dont think it's realistic to expect to do the same for SARS-2 within several years. Maybe 10 years from now we will have it"
2021-06-02 16:21,"The Chinese were studying Corona Virus in the Wuhan lab. Strong circumstantial evidence for a leak.
The administration and media  may already know that the virus came from the lab- but are slow playing the story to avoid looking incompetent and political in their prior “expert” vilification of the lab theory."
2021-06-02 17:13,"'Evidence', nor its absence, has objective value without interpretation, to which it serves as input. Common definitions refer to 'facts', an equally fraught term that builds on (necessarily always subjective) interpretation.
Truth and justice remain forever tied to opinions of interpreters.
Journalists should stop arguing about existence or absence of 'evidence' in order to bolster what is always and ultimately, an idea or opinion.
Ultimately, terms like 'evidence' and 'fact' express opinions and are always subjective."
2021-06-02 17:17,"Without real cooperation from the Chinese authorities, it will be difficult to know. If this specific Corona virus was present in the Wuhan lab, there should be laboratory records of it’s presence there. If the Wuhan laboratory workers reported to be hospitalized with flu like symptoms were identified, there could be a serological record. If these folks were “patients zero”, their close contacts would likely have been infected early on."
2021-06-02 17:23,"Good luck to Mr. Biden. His investigation is a valiant but, I fear, quixotic effort. We will never know the real origin of SARS-CoV-2.

There are elements to the virus that suggest its zoonotic origin: its initial reported spread proximal to the Wuhan wet market; the fatality and contagion characteristics; the well-known natural reservoires of potential ancestors in the Chinese bat population.

There are also elements that suggest it was an accidental release from a lab conducting gain-of-function experiments: it's chimeric genome; prior security criticism at the Wuhan Institute of Virology; official Chinese government response to the virus and WHO requests for information.

In the end, there is no smoking gun. Any analysis will be based on a probabilistic assessment that may tip in one direction or another but not provide certainty. We will never know for sure. We need to accept that and move on."
2021-06-02 17:28,"What is the probability that the epicenter is next to a covid lab? Very very small, if not zero. Could it be by chance? Yes. Is it likely? No. 

So what is the causality? That should be investigated.

It does not have to be a weapon or advanced manipulation of the virus. It could be that the lab personnel often goes to bat caves or that they just studied a covid virus and got infected. I do not know for sure. But it should of course be investigated. 

One cannot understand why the scientists are so cautious. Since the probability is close to zero, the causality has to be investigated."
2021-06-02 17:58,"""China’s lack of cooperation with the W.H.O. has long fueled suspicions about how the coronavirus, known as SARS-CoV-2, had emerged seemingly from nowhere to seize the world.""

If I correctly understand the very basics of zoonotic jumping, it's never ""seemingly from nowhere"" despite that appearance.  It may have been circulating for years, if not decades, amongst people who handle the wet market animals but in a very inefficient and feeble manner.  But, over many generations of replicating the virus becomes more and more adapted to its human hosts. The ""out of nowhere"" comes when a particular virus mutates in such a way that it us truly at home in a human host such that it is easily transmitted from human to human and can take full advantage of human ribosomes in order to replicate.  

I wonder if there are clues to its origins (zoonotic vs. lab leak)  to be found in the fact that we now know it is also able to infect other mammals such as large cats in zoos, domestic cats and dogs, and mink farms in northern Europe?"
2021-06-02 18:01,"As a scientist I wouldn't rule out either origin theory, like some did with the lab leak. But you don't need to be a scientist to see which so called experts are unabashed non scientific political hacks these days."
2021-06-02 18:11,Ground zero was in Wuhan.  The odds are astronomically in favor of a release from the lab.  There are very few coincidences in this world like this.
2021-06-02 17:53,"At this moment, the name to keep an eye on is Peter Daszak 

The walls might be closing in on him, given that he ran bat coronavirus research at the wihan lab AND was put in charge of the flawed WHO report 

His public statements from Day 1 have been fishy 

As the story evolves, will the public view Peter Daszak as scapegoat or villain?!?"
2021-06-02 17:50,"Timing is everything. One recollects the protests in Hong Kong. One recollects the P.L.A gathering just outside Hong Kong. Then one recollects the virus happening, the P.L.A not happening and the protests not happening."
2021-06-02 17:28,"It does not matter if our enemies like Russia or China or North Korea, make deadly viruses or if they develop naturally in nature, we should be prepared to identify, decode their DNA  and make vaccines and drugs to counter them. We were unprepared because of Trump's elimination of the pandemic response office  in 2018 and his inherent incompetence in dealing with with complex problems. The most important lesson from this pandemic is competent leadership matters. Just following the basics of dealing with a pandemic-- we would have avoided hundreds of thousands of deaths and saved  trillions of dollars. The basics include universal face mask use and widespread testing -- 2 things Trump fought against from the outset of this pandemic."
2021-06-02 18:39,The same intelligence agencies that brought weapons of mass destruction to the U.S. public. What could possibly go wrong?
2021-06-02 18:49,"""In the beginning, there was a lot of pressure against speaking up, because it was tied to conspiracies and Trump supporters,” 

That is the problem.  The extraordinarily important question of where the virus came from has been heavily politicized from the onset. The answers to the question reported in much of the mainstream press were based on politics, not science.  Frankly, the record shows that much of the blame for the this lies with the progressive media, which found right wing conspiracies under every rock, and directed most of their reporting to the task of discrediting Trump prior to the election, rather than reporting facts in an unbiased manner.

Today, Trump is no longer president, and we can address these questions with a degree of calm impartiality.  And we must do so.  The most likely answer is that the virus emerged from nature, but this is far from a certainty.  Further investigation, uninfluenced by the politics of the day, must be performed.  Given that millions have died, millions of more have long term sequelae, the lives of just about everyone on the planet have been disrupted, and many trillions of dollars have been spent, we need to know the truth, to the extent possible.

And the news media needs to take a long, hard look in the mirror."
2021-06-02 19:35,If the dear and sainted Dr. Fauci ever truly answers the question as to our involvement with the gain-of-function research and finally stops waffling perhaps we will better see what really happened.  I fear that will never happen because the good doctor had more to do with its origins then he cares to reveal. Hopefully the truth will eventually emerge.
2021-06-02 19:14,"All the scientist agree that this virus is natural. The question is whether this escapes from the lab or is it natural mutation. The only new evidence release is that there were 3 workers went to hospital in November for URI symptoms. Nothing out of ordinary besides that. I have a simple question. What about the positive antibodies among the cancer screening patients in Italy in October 2019. This shows the data concerning the lab leak is trash tabloid news. Covid-19 was already spreading via a less infectious or lethal form in the summer of 2019. It probably mutated into the lethal forms first in Wuhan. We are seeing the different strains now that are more infectious like the British, Brazilian, South African and the Indian strain"
2021-06-02 19:35,Daszak is definitely the most suspicious character in all this. Let's find out more on how and why he's so certain this didn't come from a lab. No one else is.
2021-06-02 20:10,Absence of evidence is not evidence of absence.
2021-06-02 20:10,"I have one government saying one thing, another suggesting something else, a world health organization chiming in along with media everywhere.  And not a one of them (including this paper) have any credibility with me.  (I come here for the comments)

Throughout the pandemic I have listened to sources that I do trust like the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle Children's hospital, the University of Washington, and my doctors.  THEY have credibility with me."
2021-06-02 20:27,"I wish reporting on the possibility of a lab leak addressed the issue of ""gain of function"" research in general and at the Wuhan lab."
2021-06-02 20:55,"The NYT and other media outlets have failed utterly to report on this in depth with good investigative reporting.  There is a *significant* amount of critical information that shows the lab leak is quite possible, and in fact probably more likely than the zoonotic jumping-species theory.  I’m no conspiracy theorist and I don’t think the lab leak was intentional but I do think that -tragically - that is what happened.  If you want excellent analysis of this question, read this:

2021-06-02 19:49,"Each new death is another reason why we need to learn everything that we can to protect humanity. We don't need new evidence to shift focus from vaccines to scrutinizing whether there has been a sufficiently thorough origins investigation.

The call for a more thorough investigation, after initial skepticism, has caused a lot of hand wringing and finger pointing, but I think this is all overblown. 

No one believed Tom Cotton and Trump because they lie. If you lie people won't believe you.  

The Chinese government resisted a thorough investigation of its science lab and went into defensive mode. Okay. That's pretty much how you would expect them to act either way.

WHO was compromised apparently in overstating the certainty that this did not come from a lab. Maybe they figured, throughout human history, from leprosy to the bubonic plague, to the Spanish flu, to AIDS, to SARS, to everything in between, the entire parade of disease horribles all arose from nature. No lab needed for any of that. So to resist the belief that this came from a lab--maybe also to want to avoid hate crimes--people could have acted in good faith based on the screaming emergency they were facing at the time. I would like to thing that WHO was prioritizing direct actions to save lives at the time that statement was made.  

And now it is time to say that this lab origins possibility needs a more thorough investigation. Why act like it's a big scandal?"

(Google is your friend, you won’t find it noted here)

2) the epicenter happens to be home to a lab that studies and manipulates the virus

3) the supposed animal vector has not been identified (maybe in time)

4) China is not exactly honest 

5) The WHO is complicit (remember “no evidence of human to human transmission”)

6) some media has fallen flat on this and needs to do a better job"
2021-06-02 20:05,"Proponents of the lab leak theory have pointed out that the bat virus most similar to covid is found hundreds of miles to the south, in Yunnan province. This is too far for the bats to have flown. 

The answer to this puzzle is the trade in wild animals, much of it illegal. One of the major smuggling routes comes across China's southern border with Myanmar, and then passes through Yunnan province on the way to the rest of China. Wuhan is a major crossroads which would make it a likely location for the warehousing and transshipment of illegal goods headed to northern China. The smuggling of wild animals is linked to the smuggling of drugs from the Golden Triangle region, which includes northern Myanmar. The smuggling trade is likely facilitated by payoffs to corrupt Chinese officials. I think the wet markets are linked to the illegal trade.

Some of the live animal trade is legal. One of China's top disease doctors, Zhong Nanshan, has pointed to badgers and bamboo rats as possible disease intermediaries. A New York Times article I link to below claims than both were on sale in Wuhan. It reports that the bamboo rats were produced by farmers in Guangxi, which borders on Yunnan. The WHO report confirms that wildlife products sold in the Wuhan wet market came from all over China, including Yunnan.

An enquiry into this situation is now being suppressed in Canadian parliament, with Prime minister Justin Trudeau saying that the investigation simply smacks of “anti-Asian prejudice”. There is, apparently, deep involvement of the Chinese military, and strong association with the Wuhan lab. Something is very wrong here; it shouldn’t be ignored."
2021-06-02 19:54,"Let the CCP get away with this and who knows what they'll unleash on us next time.  Honest people do not fear transparency but the Chinese gov't sure does.  So far as I can tell, every cent we saved buying Chinese goods made with Chinese wages was spent dealing with COVID.  People's lives were devastated by globalization so we could get cheap gadgets & now we are stuck with a behemoth that does not respect basic human rights such as physical security & our right to be informed about our medical issues.  People who contracted COVID certainly need to understand their disease & we all need to know how to prevent another outbreak, especially considering what Chinese virologists now know about coronviruses.  At this point, I would do anything to go back to the days when China was a closed-off, marginalized country with an inefficient economy.  You know, the days when things were union-made, employers paid good wages & we all had pension funds.  I have bought five toasters over 25 years, all made in China, while my mother's wedding gift toaster survived 25 years & 7 children.  Oh, & my father retired with four pensions, two employers, the gov't & his veteran's benefits.  My life is so much better now that Amazon gets to send me a Chinese toaster every 15 minutes. Yay!"

It doesn't help that the Chinese government has not been very forthright in their cooperation when it comes to investigating the source of the virus.

2021-06-02 23:06,"Dr. Steven Quay, M.D., PhD., CEO of Atossa Therapeutics is one of the most cited scientists in the world.  On Jan 29th he published a 193-page paper titled: 

""A Bayesian analysis concludes beyond a reasonable doubt that SARS-CoV-2 is not a natural zoonosis but instead is laboratory derived."" 

""The final conclusion is that it is a 99.8% probability SARS-CoV-2 came from a laboratory and only a 0.2% likelihood it came from nature.

Like many others, I am concerned about what appear to be significant conflicts of interest between members of the WHO team and scientists and doctors in China and how much this will impede an unbiased examination of the origin of SARS-CoV-2""  - Dr. Quay

Then we have EcoHealth Alliance's Peter Daszak, a prime member of WHO's investigatory team with close ties to bat woman Shi Zhengli, the director of WIV.  He's openly and repeatedly dismissed the possibility of a lab leak.

Correspondence obtained by U.S. Right to Know (USRTK) show Daszak played a central role obscuring the lab origin of SARS-CoV-2 from the beginning by crafting a scientific statement condemning such inquiries as “conspiracy theory.”

This manufactured “consensus” was relied on by the media to counter anyone presenting theories and evidence to the contrary.  Daszak also headed up the second commission to investigate the origin of the virus, The Lancet COVID-19 commission (9/14/20), to ensure the fake “consensus” be maintained.

The cover-up is now unravelling."
2021-06-02 22:48,"Blindly disbelieving a claim because your enemy is making it is no more rational than blindly believing a claim that your ally makes.

Make note of everyone who tried to shut down the discussion on the lab leak hypothesis, those people are not to be trusted, they will always put partisan politics above the truth, regardless of the consequences."

2021-06-02 23:38,"Peter Daszak's Ecohealth Alliance has received many millions in funding from many US government sources for gain-of-function research.

When SARS-CoV-2 first emerged in Wuhan, China, the EcoHealth Alliance was providing funding to WIV to collect and study novel bat coronaviruses — and now Daszak has been the primary expert chosen by the mainstream media to explain the origin of the pandemic as being zoonotic in nature?

Daszak works with dozens of high-containment laboratories around the world that collect pathogens and use genetic engineering and synthetic biology to make them more infectious, contagious, lethal or drug-resistant.  These include labs controlled by the U.S. Department of Defense, in countries in the former Soviet Union, the Middle East, South East Asi, and Africa.

Many of these labs are staffed by former biological weapons scientists. (See Arms Watch's reports) Before the Biological Weapons Convention was ratified, this research was called what it is: biological weapons research.  Now, it's euphemistically called gain-of-function or dual-use research.

It's the $44.2-million PREDICT grant that EcoHealth Alliance used to fund the gain-of-function experiment by WIV scientist Zhengli Shi and the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill's Ralph Baric.

Daszak's EcoHealth  Alliance also has other Pentagon contracts in Tanzania, South Africa, Liberia, Georgia, Malaysia, and Thailand.

Daszak is the Cover-Up's mouthpiece and thus the Media's favorite go-to guy."
2021-06-02 23:43,"Will we also remind ourselves that only as recently as a few months ago, anyone who dared suggest this virus may have come from a lab was considered a racist and / or conspiracy theorist? Or perhaps we will just forget that now that Facebook is permitting lab leak discussion on their platform again; ever the arbiter of truth."
2021-06-03 0:09,"Whether or not this was a lab leak the truth is that it could have been a lab leak.

There needs to be an open debate about the pros and cons of controversial gain of function experiments and the dangers of unsafe biolabs, particularly those experimenting on biological weapons, and possible future pandemics because of a lab security failure.

In addition, Peter Daszak who is the President of EcoHealth who was one of the WHOs investigators has a conflict of interest.  He should have never been chosen or accepted.

2021-06-03 1:46,"We need to clearly specify what exactly the ""lab-leak"" theory is, rather than opposing it to a hypothetical and equally ill-defined  ""natural-origins"" theory.

They are not mutually exclusive.

The Wuhan Center for Disease Control and Prevention (WCDCP) and the newer Wuhan Institute for Virology (WIV) were both studying coronaviruses more than a decade before the recent outbreak. The WCDCP is located only 911 ft. from the Huanan Seafood Market. Until comparatively recently, all studies of coronaviruses were conducted in lower-security Level 2 or Level 3 labs. The WIV, opened in 2014 only had a certified L-4 lab in 2018, little more than a year before the pandemic. 

The labs not only performed experiments, but also gathered, transported, stored, and disposed of biological specimens. The lab-leak theory refers not only to experiments but also to these other necessary functions performed by lab workers. No one doubts that bats are the original carriers of many, many coronaviruses. An important question is whether lab workers were the original human hosts.

Early research in Yunnan demonstrated that some coronaviruses were directly transmissible to humans. A Chinese study also acknowledged the likelihood of a lab leak. <a href=""https://img-prod.tgcom24.mediaset.it/images/2020/02/16/114720192-5eb8307f-017c-4075-a697-348628da0204.pdf"" target=""_blank"">https://img-prod.tgcom24.mediaset.it/images/2020/02/16/114720192-5eb8307f-017c-4075-a697-348628da0204.pdf</a>....."

1. Is the durability of their responses diferent from those who recovered without long-haul symptoms?
2. Are their related B-cells as prevalent in their bone marrow as the cohort previously studied?
3. Both questions above studied with/without subsequent vaccination post-infection.

There is no reference in the study to trial subjects who were ""immunized."" In fact, the current crop of vaccines are not designed to provide immunity.

They are designed as treatment for SARS-CoV-2 symptoms that might result in the disease Covid-19.

The article goes on to say ""most people who have recovered from Covid-19 and who were later immunized will not need boosters.""

The study concludes that persons infected and showing mild symptoms showed strong B cell responses that provided immunity. There is no ""later"" immunization.

This article is written as if there is a relationship between getting a vaccine and being ""immunized."" If anything the studies show that persons who have recovered from Covid-19 don't need a vaccine or a booster.

Finally, this was a very small study (18 people) and comparing antibodies from persons who had Covid with persons who were vaccinated tells you very little, other than the vaccine is generating an ant-body response, which it what it's supposed to do.

After discussion with Infectious Diseases experts at UPenn and UMass as well as my own research testing for antibodies specific against COVID, I have decided that there is no requirement for me to receive any of the 3 vaccines considering that I tested negative for the COVID for 6 months after testing positive a month prior to testing positive. Senator from Kentucky Dr. Rand Paul who had the COVID infection also recently has declared he will not get the vaccine. 

I would highly recommend to those who never had COVID infection and still have to received the vaccine to get the vaccine as soon as is possible and acquire long-term immunity the easy way compared to the hard way that some of us acquired the immunity."

I tested positive. I received the monoclonal antibody therapy. I also was sick for two weeks but not as bad as her. Unfortunately, I lent the virus to my four-year-old. He had a cold for three days. My wife did not get sick/reinfected from my son or me. In conclusion, I believe the immunity against COVID-19 lasts a pretty long time.

However, I now wonder, based on this article, are people who have had covid-19 the ones who are more likely to have this extended immunity? I will have to read further to see. Not that it would have made the risk of getting infected with covid-19 and the risk of death worth it - absolutely not. 

What I also want to know is if they have come up with better, less expensive tests, for this additional level of immunity.  I'm sure we would all love to know what is going on with our  memory B cells regarding covid-19, especially since so many may have been asymptomatic."

It's also a cover for private companies and government offices that have returned to their old dirty ways of not cleaning. It was refreshing to see clean ATMs and checkouts but it was cutting into the profit margin in buying cleaning supplies and paying workers.  So back to dirty. 

We will continue to use common sense and follow our own guide rules. Robust hygiene which was part of our routine even before the pandemic and wearing masks. It will be interesting to see their backpedaling when there is another wave. Ooops or flat out denial."

I'm not seeing the same medical issues with those vaccinated. Those infected with Covid  may have years of immunity along with years of lung problems and violent thoughts."
2021-05-26 21:02,"This article just adds to the ongoing and growing confusion surrounding COVID-19 and the vaccinations. 

That is to be expected to some extent, as scientists and government leadership struggle to explain unfolding information to a large and intellectually diverse population. Add to that the proactive efforts to encourage and spread disinformation.

So. Previously, there was a trend among some to promote actually contracting the virus to ensure immunity. Scientists said, no, avoid getting COVID-19 because it is a killer; and even if it doesn't kill you it could compromise your health for the rest of your life.

Now, we are being told that survivors of COVID-19 who have been vaccinated are in the best shape. I think there should be a footnote that they are very fortunate to have survived it and it is hoped they will not suffer residual effects that will compromise their future quality of life. 

That said, I am glad to hear that because it means it reduces the chances of another pandemic of this particular coronavirus. And, as someone who has never had COVID (to my knowledge) and has been fully vaccinated, I am fine with getting a booster -- every year with or rolled into my flu shot, if necessary."
2021-05-26 21:05,"The studies have created an ironic dilemma for people who would rather rely upon their own immune response than be vaccinated.  They can have better, longer lasting immunity if they recover from COVID-19 and then get vaccinated.
Of course they will not believe these scientific studies."
2021-05-26 21:07,"In my case, I have fully vaccinated, and I am as certain as I can be (given the lack of clinical verification) that I had Covid 19 in late 2019/early 2020.

Because I cannot verify if I indeed had the virus 16 years ago, I don't know for sure if this long-term reliability applies to me, or if my immunity is due entirely to vaccinations."
2021-05-26 21:07,"These results are based on the two-shot vaccine. 
""26 had also received at least one dose of either the Moderna or the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine.""

Once again, results and policy are focusing only on the mRNA vaccine.

Last week we had been promised that the CDC would gather data to test the long term efficacy of the J&J vaccine, as well as the efficacy of the vaccine against the variants.  But the CDC no longer promises anything.

The CDC has stated they will no longer gather data about break outs.  The results for the two-shot vaccine is very promising;  the CDC is confident that life can go one, and by far most people received the two shot mRNA vaccine.  

9 million people received the J&J vaccine, some of them over 60.  The CDC has written them off."
2021-05-26 21:31,"All the comments here are focused on antibodies.

One thing that's worth remembering (not covered in the article) is that the second study at BioRxiv (which has now been published in the Journal of Experimental Medicine) looked at T-cell memory and found similar things going on.  

Which is what you'd expect since T-cells play a critical role in what B-cells do.

""These responses (antibody production) are dependent on specialized  helper T-cells that control the activation and selection of antibody producing plasma and B cells""  (p. 5)

Later they look at CD4 and CD8 memory T cells:

""....polyfunctional SARS-CoV-2 antigen-specific CD4 and CD8 memory T-cells were elevated at the same time points.  The persistence of antigen-specific memory T-cells is directly correlated with and parallels the B cell compartment."" (p. 5)

Lots remains to be uncovered about immune system responses but some good work being done these days."
2021-05-26 21:36,one issue to consider is whether all vaccines will be as effective in delivering long term protection
2021-05-26 21:38,"I’m confused.  If just being vaccinated means a possible lifetime of boosters, but having covid plus the vaccine means the opposite, shouldn’t we be encouraging the vaccinated to try to get actual covid as it would be mild?"
2021-05-26 21:50,"I'm thinking that researchers may be able to develop boosters, if necessary, that will confer much longer immunity than the original vaccinations, possibly indefinite."
2021-05-26 21:50,"I think they're right !

I've been infected by Covid19 at the very begining of the pandemy, even before it was announced on TV, I thought first it was a special flu (the only difference was the lost of taste). Nothing terrible, not much pain and after 4 days it was over.

within few weeks I felt teh second time the same symtoms but clearly attenuated and lasting only a couple of hours, I knew I was infected once more and my immune system responded well.

Some days ago I received my first shot of Pfizer and I felt the same response of my immune system, I felt it was not necessary but can reinforce the response to the virus, should he become a new mutant, because variants are not much a problem.

I know for sure that the immune system is responding after more than 2 years and probably much longer. I will accept the second dose of Pfizer because there's very old people in my family, it's more about reassuring  relatives than securing myself because I'm already safe."
2021-05-26 22:00,"Who funded the studies?

Is it possible to not have antibodies after having had the virus but still have some protection?

(Yes, I got the first Moderna shot.)"
2021-05-26 22:02,"Not convinced that ""long-lived"" immunity can be reliably predicted on the basis of the data available from a roughly 18 month period.  Also not convinced that researchers are in any position to predict what will emerge as variants develop and spread. The precautionary principle should be applied, as conclusive evidence remains lacking."
2021-05-26 22:03,"Hopefully, their assumptions are true. But when people make predictions about the duration of immunity from this complex disease --I respond no one knows for sure and time and data will tell. B cell memory and the ability to amplify antibody levels may or may not be sufficient to prevent infection or reinfection. In my primary care practice, I am checking baseline spike protein antibody responses after vaccination and plan to reassess in 6months and 1yr--if antibodies decrease to undetectable levels we certainly may need booster shots  and if they don't we likely won't. Hopefully, immunity will last years like they postulate but honestly no one knows for sure. Unfortunately, resistance to vaccination will likely mean covid infections will continue unabated for some time but hopefully no mutation will occur that is resistant to vaccines we have or  are able to develop."
2021-05-26 21:37,"""But there is no guarantee that such immunity will be powerful enough to protect him for years, particularly given the emergence of variants of the coronavirus that can partially sidestep the body’s defenses.""

Technically there's no guarantee any form of immunity will work since you may be immune compromised - as we all are to some degree due to our uptake of Monsanto's glyphosates via food and from the air (from glyphosate-exposed plants burned for biofuels).  

There's a direct relationship between the number of Covid deaths and a country's glyphosate use according to senior MIT researchers.

Naturally acquired immunity is broader and deeper than artificial injected immunity (regardless of what the media wrongly states).  It does a better job activating the long-term T-cells of your adaptive immune system - and those powerful T-cells are better at blocking variants developed via mutation.  If your T-cells are strong you can be Covid immune without antibodies.

Studies find those with acquired natural immunity protection against the 2003 SARS-CoV are also protected against the 2019 SARS-CoV-2, which has about 20% variability.

Compare that to the most variable variant to date, variable by only 0.3%.  Natural and vaccinated immunity will easily protect against these variants (regardless of what the media wrongly states).  

Danger, scary science ahead:

2021-05-26 20:55,What kind people to volunteer for bone marrow samples as part of the study! That’s not a walk in the park!
2021-05-26 21:01,"This is so unlike other coronaviruses, where immunity is far less lasting. I hope they’re studying why."
2021-05-26 21:26,"I contracted COVID-19 in March 2020. My symptoms were mild, a mild cough and a low grade fever. One of my co-workers became ill at the same time, testing positive for COVID-19, hospitalized, very ill, and thankfully recovering. I enrolled in an antibody study at the University of Washington after my recovery in May 2020. My COVID-19 antibody titer was very high through September 2020 but dropped sharply in October-November 2020 (this is a titer of circulating antibodies). My antibody titer changed one time only- after my first dose of the Pfizer vaccine but the level did not reach the peak of the May-September 2020 level. Now my ab titers are almost undetectable which might mean that I am susceptible to COVID-19 again or that the immunity resides in my immune cell “memory” B cells and T cells or somewhere in between.
This is all very confusing to me least of all because I took university immunology before much was understood about B cells, T cells, their subtypes and interactions, how they differentiate and respond to antigens, the involvement of the Major Histocompatibility Complex etc. The fact that there are several corona viruses causing “colds” in humans that can effectively evade the immune system also confuses me- these viruses also initiate the immune responses of COVID-19 but illness still occurs.
So, when I read another article like this in a newspaper I leave confused. I’m certain though that COVID-19 will always be with us and all the rosy predictions are early."
2021-05-26 20:51,"These results should be advertised widely on every medium in the U.S. - TV, internet, newspapers, radio, direct mailing and billboards.

Anti-Vaxers should be forced to continually reconcile their choices with the science and facts.

For myself, I will still get the booster shot just to be on the safe side."
2021-05-26 21:11,"Finally, real scientists who understand immunity and not epidemiologist who seem to have forgotten all they learned in Biology 1 in high school about immunity."

2021-05-26 22:10,We need a cheap easy antibody kit in which we can monitor our own antibodies. You could volunteer your results if you wanted.
2021-05-26 22:14,"Good news, but I have no problem with  a booster shot."
2021-05-26 21:41,"1. The studies are good news; though limited (bone marrow samples, ouchie), they appear to show that infection vaccination, vaccination, and infection all produce some degree of long-term immunity.

2. It’s important, because we really didn’t know. By the way, when a real scientist says they dunno, it means they dunno. When they say they figured it out because the experiment or data is complete, it is not proof that they changed their mind or lied to you. It means that they didn’t know, and now they think they do.

3. It looks like the best possible protection is infection vaccination, followed by vaccination alone. It also looks like some people don’t develop great long-term immunity. It would be good to know who’s who with some simple test—but unless you’d like a nice bine marrow sampling (BIG bore needle, folks !), looks to me like vaccination is your best bet whether you’ve been infected or not.

4. Bit of a pro tip, folks: a study only studies what the study studies. It can’t answer every auestion you might come up with, create M4A￼, or whatever.

It also can’t guarantee your individual safety; it can only sometimes tell you what your best bet is as far as anybody knows."
2021-05-26 21:59,"Informative. My question is about Sinovac, a Chinese vaccine that I got (living in Mexico) made from dead virus, unlike the Pfizer and Moderna. Perhaps different?"
2021-05-26 22:44,"I'm very confused how these studies indicated a difference between immune responses to the vaccine in convalescent subjects vs the uninfected. They each seem to have been testing for the presence of immunity indicators in convalescent subjects vs control groups with no mention of vaccinated subjects.

Ms. Mandavilli quotes Dr. Nussenzweig, the lead of the memory B cell study, as saying people who were both infected and vaccinated have terrific protection, and Mandavilli also writes ""immune memory is like to be organized differently after immunization, compared with that following natural infection"".
But I don't see anything in the data or discussions about that potential difference, and certainly don't see anything about what their results mean for booster shots.

The study's summary is as follows, which notably makes no mention of participants being vaccinated, nor does it draw any comparison between immune responses in vaccinated vs unvaccinated:
""We show that SARS-CoV-2 infection elicits broadly reactive and highly functional memory T cell responses that persist 6 months after infection. In addition, recovered individuals show enduring immune alterations in CD4+ and CD8+ T cells compartments.""

If anyone has insight into what I am missing here it would be greatly appreciated."
2021-05-26 22:51,"Interesting article, but one problem. Neither one of the cited studies are about vaccines—at all. 

Please, click on the links. Take a look at them. They are studies on natural immune responses to prior infection. Mandavilli’s questions are indeed directed at the studies authors but their (informed) speculation about natural immunity plus vaccination are beyond the scope of these two papers. 

I could find nothing in Nussenzweig’s pre-print about the 26 participants who had “also received at least one dose” of either of the mRNA vaccines. There were 61 participants according to the pre-print, not 63, but no information on their vaccination status. Might be wrong, of course. May have missed it, but in any case these papers are not about the efficacy of vaccines. 

If anything they cast doubt on the dubiously unqualified advice to ignore prior exposure when recommending vaccination."
2021-05-26 22:52,"Here me out:  In the fight against covid now in America, social distancing is our worst enemy.  Herd immunity is possible, and the unvaccinated can help us get there, but not while social distancing remains in place.  Fifty percent vaccine rate plus a 20 to 30 percent natural immunity via community spread can help create the conditions where Covid dies out, and that is good for everyone, even the vulnerable.  I think we're close, but social distancing will drag this out. Now is the time to for covid to burn out."
2021-05-26 23:00,"So after approximately 18 months of Covid experience, there is ""data"" to predict the length of immunity?  Weren't these observational studies?
I love optimism, but we're still accumulating data daily, and variants are still being discovered.  These predictions, though logical, are not based on enough data.  RCTs are required."
2021-05-26 23:11,"Talk about confusing the public. Before the pandemic, I understood that people kept getting the common cold because the virus kept changing and thus evading the immune response. But then last spring we were told that was not true, we kept getting colds because immunity did not last. Now it seems we are back to my original understanding. Look, I am a scientist, but even I can see this is part of why people don't trust science."
2021-05-26 23:21,"My son, an infectious disease doctor, lost a man in his 50s who recovered from COVID-19, only to be infected again.  The second time, the guy just couldn't beat it.

Even if that's one in a million, the advice is to get the vaccine.  The side effects of the vaccine are minor compared to one in three who've had COVID-19 suffering long term side effects of the disease."
2021-05-26 23:28,"From Nature, ""This study sought to determine whether SARS-CoV-2 infection induces antigen-specific long-lived BMPCs in humans,"" yet Apoorva is making sweeping judgements about what this means in regards to vaccination--which has nothing to do with this study.

From bioRx prestudy they state purpose, ""To gain further understanding of the immune response in recovered individuals we measured T cell responses""

How is Apoorva drawing any conclusions on vaccination status among those infected or uninfected with COVID?!!!"
2021-05-26 23:30,"I would sooner be vaccinated and boostered than contracting Covid just for the immunity without a shot or booster. There’s a chance I could develop a severe illness from Covid.

That’s why most vaccines are developed and used - to grant immunity without severe illness that comes from some viruses. Take the measles vaccine - having measles can cause brain damage. Who wants that to happen? Another use would be to limit transmission - less transmission, less people infected. 

I get a flu shot every year to boost my immunity to the flu. If I do get the flu, it’s less remarkable than if I didn’t have the flu vaccine. I can continue to work hard at my business and not worry about taking time off due to illness or worse effects."
2021-05-26 22:24,"The synopsis post which the author of this article posted in Twitter is extremely misleading and in my opinion will lead to many persons totally misconstruing what they should do in light of the research findings of the two papers referenced. I think the tweet should be withdrawn or rewritten with more clarity.  The author's subsequent tweets did little more to help. As everyone knows, few might read the author's chain of tweets to the full extent, thousands may re-tweet only the original post without bothering to read the linked NYT article at all and gaining fuller detail, and then out of those few who actually go to the NYT article, even fewer will go on to read the research articles themselves. The original articles have caveats about interpreting the results; they have nuanced statements; they have cautions to heed about the results; they have speculations, and so on.  Science and medical journalists need to  display a better obligation to NYT readers and all others who may simply get a re-tweet than this author is displaying.  Regretfully, the NYT's reporting and handling of information extracted from these two research papers may prove to be detrimental to public health endeavors, because so much content was glossed over, watered down and simplified, or ignored completely."

2021-05-26 23:48,"The next logical question for me is, what about a vaccinated individual who then contracts COVID-19, albeit a hopefully mild case. Then my next leap is, aren’t we better off shedding the masks unless we need to protect an unvaccinated/at-risk individual? Keep training our immune system?"
2021-05-26 23:54,"As a person with MS don't be so happy about auto immunity when triggered by some outlier event. It is believed this is what led to multiple sclerosis and  certain other diseases. It is thought they may be triggered survivor genes that can't be turned off.

From day one i thought it was weird how the symptoms mirrored Multiple Sclerosis flare ups. Even some of the medicine used to reduce symptoms are used to treat MS inflammation.  When it was revealed Cytokine Storms were occurring in Covid patients it verified what I suspected. 

Vaccines are a more controlled way of obtaining immunity and much preferable to an auto immune system that may not be controllable in the future for those who were infected. I wouldn't break out the champagne glasses yet."
2021-05-26 23:59,"""The findings may help put to rest lingering fears that protection against the virus will be short-lived.""

These were not fears, but cautions from professionals who indicated that more studies were needed with the new virus.  These results still are contextual, requiring infection as well as vaccination for long term immunity ... and sample size is small.  Given that vaccination alone still has time limits and is expected to require boosters, the concerns remain real."
2021-05-27 0:01,"I wonder does this effect (longer potential protection) among those who have had covid vary as a function of the presence or absence of long haulers' symptoms?

2021-05-27 0:08,"It is so irresponsible to assume that immunity acquired from having recovered from the virus is inferior in any way to that coming from recovery with subsequent vaccination. Until there is definitive proof that more is better (which does not exist currently in any way, shape or form), we need to stop recommending AND expecting people who have recovered, and are immune, get vaccinated. There is absolutely no evidence that is necessary. More is not better!  I agree with Senator Rand Paul. Until there is clinical evidence that recovery from exposure is not protective, we should not be recommending vaccinations to a (large) population that is already immune!"

A fear of the unknown is not entirely irrational, but is it a good reason not to do your part to end a pandemic that has taken hundreds of thousands of lives? Should we demand that our government prove to us, beyond a shadow of a doubt, that vaccination poses no risk?

Good data, though."
2021-05-27 2:22,"I don't normally agree with Rand Paul on anything, but in this case, I think he is probably right.  I've had COVID, and recovered completely from it.  I chose to not get the vaccine.  Based on all of the studies I have reviewed, it appears very likely that I do have durable immunity to the virus, probably for a very long time.  People who were infected with the SARS virus 18 years ago (a coronavirus very similar to COV-SARS-2), still have strong immunity to it 18 years later.  As this article says, the immune system responds very differently to attack from a real virus, as opposed to how it responds to a vaccine that uses only the spike protein from the virus.  Being exposed to the real virus likely offers better protection, based on everything I have read.  I understand that there is ""no guarantee"" that being infected confers durable immunity, but the science does seem to support the notion that durable immunity after infection is very likely."

I can get behind demanding research continues in using better ingredients in vaccines, that and holding pharmaceuticals to standards should always be a goal. I just do not understand the automatic ignorant rejection of vaccinations."
2021-05-27 2:39,The health care communities were vaccinated months before the general public and have higher chances of coming across the virus in future outbreaks earlier than others. The CDC and large hospital systems should carefully track and monitor breakthrough cases among the frontline health care professionals. A significant uptick in breakthrough cases among such health professionals may very well signify the need to administer booster shots for the general public.
2021-05-27 2:41,How do they know that the subjects who had a natural infection were actually infected? Antibody tests don’t works a few weeks after the infection.
2021-05-27 3:11,"let's have a robust analysis and discussion of the nitty gritty of the studies by two sets of scientists on both sides of the political aisle so to speak.
things to analyze:
-what are the exact numbers of enhanced protection for people who had covid and then got vaccinated?  Ie how much neutralizing antibodies does a person need?  does a covid survivor have sufficient neutralizing antibodies?  is a vaccine actually extraneous and not needed for such a person?
-what is the cost benefit analysis for different age and health cohorts: for example, would it be better for a 16 year old healthy girl to purposefully contract covid and not get vaccinated at all versus her never catching it, and then getting vaccinated and then needing to get boosters each year?  what are the side effects associated etc?

many many more questions obviously.  i hope the times will tackle them all in a candid and straight forward fashion."
2021-05-27 3:36,"Great, no need for those of us who've had the virus to get vaccinated.  Thanks for the info."
2021-05-27 4:03,"My 100 yr. old mother was born 13 days after the last Pandemic had died out in December in Chicago in 1920, in 1921.  Her mother was pregnant with her during those almost 9 months of 1920.  I often wonder if she had gotten some immunity from that virus back then, that has stayed with her.  She was vaccinated with the Pfizer vaccine several months ago, with no reaction."
2021-05-27 4:40,"I was infected, had a raging immune response which required hospitalization and ran to get the vaccine one month later. Big mistake! I had such a strong response to the vaccine that it felt like I had covid again for about 2.5 days, with the same 103 degree fever, and body pains which I never had with Covid. After the vaccine I had a persistent fatigue for a month, which I never had with the initial infection either. My advice, if you did get infected wait the full three months before you get the vaccine."
2021-05-27 4:57,"So if you choose not to get vaccinated you might get covid, survive and be protected for a long time OR you might die or be hospitalized and run up a huge bill.   So why risk it?  It's time for insurance companies to step up and start raising rates for those who choose to risk it.  Double or triple insurance rates for those taking such risks."
2021-05-27 5:30,"I know people in India in their forties, who got infected in March 2020 and were again infected in 2021. For a few, the infection this year was far more severe, not shorter and milder. I think the protection against variants is a caveat in immune protection and its details are not fully understood yet. The first section of the article is therefore quite misleading."
2021-05-27 6:00,I’m beginning to think that my friend who had Covid-19 may be better off than me. She had a mild case and now got vaccinated.  If is like other times when people all were sick together intentionally to get the antibodies. When are the booster shots going to be available?
2021-05-27 10:03,"I have the same approach as Rand Paul. I had COVID a year ago March and retested a year later for Antibodies which I still have. The studies infer that a vaccine may be better to induce a super immune response. This may not be necessary, especially as according to some we have reached herd immunity ie. Vaccinated people plus those immune from natural infection. There are not insignificant side effect risk from a vaccine especially for those who have had natural infection. Blood clots, myocarditis, and a variety of autoimmune conditions. BTW I’m a physician like Rand Paul"
2021-05-27 10:08,"Just common sense should tell us that the immune response to the actual virus will be superior to the immune response that is produced by the injection of a dead virus ( Astra Zeneca ) or to a protein that resembles the virus.  In the case of an actual infection the body is fighting something that replicates, seeking to infect organs and so on.   We lack understanding of the immune system.   And of course big Pharma will say vaccines are better."
2021-05-27 10:45,"So if the virus or the vaccine elicits an antibody response that lies in waiting to protect us down the road, why hasn't that same mechanism worked for other corona viruses like the common cold?  Or for the flu?  Or for any other viral infection?  And if the main antibody response retreats to a bone marrow protection that becomes active with re-exposure, what about with variants?   Have we been wasting our time ( not to mention the money) getting vaccinated from the flu?  Is there not a bone marrow immune protection to that?  I would find it very hard to believe the bone marrow picks and chooses which viruses to provide protection from.  I think convincing yourself you have nothing to worry about is foolish until we see if this virus has resurgences and if people get sick from variants after having original covid or being vaccinated.  And  the only way to find that out is with time.  The study I sure would like to see is if you practice mask wearing and social distancing and, thus, avoid getting sick, do you become an easier target for viruses?  Is your immune system weaker with less exposure?  Leading to the question: What's a healthy person to do?"
2021-05-27 8:49,"How does this jibe with NYT's article that CDC is not following more than 10,000 mild cases in vaccinated people?

Belt and suspenders--Mask and vaccine. And caution. And hand sanitizer."
2021-05-27 4:18,Finally some science to support what most people already know. Once you get infected with a virus you are very unlikely to get sick from that virus again.

That’s how now, almost 2/3 of a century old, I can now grab poison oak by it’s short and curly stocks, pull it out and throw it aside!"
2021-05-27 7:18,"The second study cited is this article is a preprint posted on BioRxiv. It is not peer-reviewed. BioRxiv specifically says:

“bioRxiv posts many COVID19-related papers. A reminder: they have not been formally peer-reviewed and should not guide health-related behavior or be reported in the press as conclusive.”

Perhaps the article text should be amended to reflect this."
2021-05-27 12:01,"I'm wondering if the author linked to the wrong bioRxiv research paper.  The author provided a link to a paper from Dr. Nussenzweig’s laboratory that was published on December 9, 2020, that makes no mention of cellular immunity responses in individuals who were vaccinated after recovering from Covid-19 infection.  Many other commenters have spotted this omission.  It turns out that there is another paper from Dr. Nussenzweig’s lab, posted on bioRxiv on May 9, 2021 that describes a cohort of 63 patients recovered from Covid, 41% of whom were also vaccinated following infection.  The paper describes affinity maturation of B cells in these individuals that was boosted by vaccination in the subset of patients that received the vaccine.  I believe this is the paper to which the author may have intended to link.  <a href=""https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.05.07.443175v1.abstract"" target=""_blank"">https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.05.07.443175v1.abstract</a>"

After more than a year of stress and death, it’s normal to want definitive answers, but we’re just not going to have them for quite a while. I’m only stunned at people who won’t get the vaccine based on half-baked nonsense."
2021-05-27 7:52,"Why does the same phenomenon not happen for the other/regular members of the corona-virus family?

Why do we expect the inherent/boosted immunity to work for years against variants of this virus when it does not for the others in the same family?

Nothing in the article clarifies that, unfortunately."

2021-05-27 8:15,"I expect the word “persist” to more commonly be used to describe the length of a disease rather than when speaking of something of a positive nature like a lasting immunity to a disease. And could that word's use have a connection to the nation’s structural delight with ongoing vaccinations? 

And then the article ignites a spark of hope by saying that those who have had the virus as well as those that have been inoculated will have lasting immunity. But not so fast because after the subheading we -only inoculated folks- quickly get thrown out of the good news boat, and probably will need booster shots. Anyway, this article seems to wander here and there. 

Because these mRNA vaccines are still in emergency authorization, and have never been used like this before in such vast numbers- I think the fewer we need the better for many people’s peace of mind. Truly we are in a wait and see mode.

 But don’t bet on immunity that (persists) when the big money is on booster shots ad infinitum."

She was encouraged by this."

2021-05-27 11:08,"My thought is that after reading the article and some of the comments, we have an extraordinary problem with people being unable to comprehend English language text regarding matters of science and health. Many ""readers"" seem to read, then draw the conclusions they had before reading, as if the text did not exist."
2021-05-27 11:51,"Someone needs to send this to anti-vaxer Rand Paul:

""...Senator Rand Paul, Republican of Kentucky, said on Sunday that he would not get a coronavirus vaccine because he had been infected in March of last year and was therefore immune....But there is no guarantee that such immunity will be powerful enough to protect him for years, particularly given the emergence of variants of the coronavirus that can partially sidestep the body’s defenses.""

And even if Rand does get infected again without the vax...he won't report just like he didn't in March 2020, working out while infected in Congressional gym infecting others."
2021-05-27 13:02,"I'm still skeptical the vaccinated will need boosters. As we all return to the world, it seems likely we'll all be constantly re-exposed to SARS-CoV-2 every couple of weeks/months in encounters with the unvaccinated. I would think being constantly re-exposed would result in maintaining the antibodies long term. But we shall see."

2021-05-27 15:31,"I may have missed this in the article, but is this true of the j and j vaccine as well? The j and j vaccine seems to be left out of the conversation when it comes to the most current vaccine research.  Because so few Americans are receiving the j and j shot comparatively, there seems to be no urgency to determine long term effects. I worry that those who had the j and j shot will be left wondering whether a new booster is needed, and if a booster is needed, whether a j and j booster will be developed at all."
2021-05-27 15:35,"I'm confused. I see one study with 19 people, one with 63 and one with 77- is that right? Is this really enough to draw these conclusions- when we know people who have gotten Covid twice in 1 year?"
2021-05-27 9:52,"The article does not mention specific vaccines; past  articles in the NYT state that PFE and Moderna work vs. strains from England and South Africa. J&J is not mentioned. More, I have come across people in NYC and Peru who were vaccinated with PFE or Moderna who later caught the Brazilian strain. Primary issue is that the vaccines were rushed and were aimed protein spikes rather than immediate destruction of the DNA template."
2021-05-27 11:59,"This  report is  extremely misleading.

In none of the studies mentioned, nor in  any of the research targeting the persistence of  immunity following recovery from natural infection from SARs-COV2, COVID19, is there the conclusion that vaccination enhances  immune memory.
In the studies there is no mention of vaccination.  There is only data on the persistence of immunity post natural infection.

That would be like saying you have recovered from measles, now let's have a measles vaccine.  All data has shown that such immunity persists for a lifetime

This is how the human immune usually behaves."
2021-05-27 12:43,A bit misleading. Getting the vaccine before natural immunity seems to destroy your chances of that long term immunity. The vaccine only proves effective in those situations where the permanant immunity has already developed. This may develop into the unfortunate circumstance that peope who recieved the vaccine may need to continuously need to be vaccinated since they won't ever attain that same degree of safety. It's also very hard to say the long term effects on immunity as the mRNA vaccines seem to be changing people's immune systems in unknown ways after 8 months
2021-05-27 14:45,"David Leonhardt's lead-in to this article is misleading and needs to be corrected: ""New studies suggest that Covid immunity — from either infection or vaccination — lasts at least a year and improves over time."" The top line of the article itself is also misleading. Folks won't get the critical details unless they dig into the meat of the article (and we know all about attention spans these days)."
2021-05-27 16:40,"Nature Abstract only studied natural immunity:
“Long-lived bone marrow plasma cells (BMPCs) are a persistent and essential source of protective antibodies1–7. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) convalescent individuals have a significantly lower risk of reinfection8–10. Nonetheless, it has been reported that anti-SARS-CoV-2 serum antibodies experience rapid decay in the first few months after infection, raising concerns that long-lived BMPCs may not be generated and humoral immunity against this virus may be short-lived11–13. Here we demonstrate that in patients who experienced mild infections (n=77), serum anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) antibodies decline rapidly in the first 4 months after infection and then more gradually over the following 7 months, remaining detectable at least 11 months after infection. Anti-S antibody titers correlated with the frequency of S-specific BMPCs obtained from bone marrow aspirates of 18 SARS-CoV-2 convalescent patients 7 to 8 months after infection. S-specific BMPCs were not detected in aspirates from 11 healthy subjects with no history of SARS-CoV-2 infection. We demonstrate that S-binding BMPCs are quiescent, indicating that they are part of a long-lived compartment. Consistently, circulating resting memory B cells directed against the S protein were detected in the convalescent individuals. Overall, we show that SARS-CoV-2 infection induces a robust antigen-specific, long-lived humoral immune response in humans.“"

R naught, the transmission rate, is not even among the population, some people by dint of their lifestyle, encounter many others while others are more solitary.  Frequent testing of the former followed by subsidized quarantine could have slowed transmission dramatically even if the app only detected a fraction of these potential super-spreaders. Similarly the app could have been used to target more precisely who were defined as ""frontline workers"" once the vaccine arrived.  Too much emphasis was placed on the vaccine's efficacy in protecting individuals and not enough on mitigating spread to the population.  
     It is unfortunate that this useful technology was misapplied to the hopeless task of contact tracing, which once community transmission took hold, was always a losing proposition.  An analogy is a switch to zone vs  man-to-man defense in the right circumstances."

You could scan said code with your phone and as soon as the lab got your result, it showed up in your app. Then all you had to do is tap a button and warn others.

""For one thing, some researchers note, exposure notification software inherently excludes certain vulnerable populations, such as elderly people who cannot afford smartphones.""

Trump told the world on March 13, 2020 that Google was almost ready with a site to guide people to coronavirus test sites, which were pretty much non-existent at that point anyway. Google was a  bit more non-committal at that point, saying that it was still in the testing phases and not indicating that it was anywhere near ready.

This was the same 3+hour marathon press conference where Trump paraded out execs from Target, Walmart, CVS and Walgreens, telling America what great companies they were and that they would all have testing sites ready very soon. Of course, none of them were prepared - they couldn't have been.

If you remember the past year, you remember another battle - the battle for control.  Various public health authorities and government agencies fought among themselves for control over the covid testing and tracing programs.  When the tech giants insisted on maintaining some privacy and security for their users, there were even MORE fights over control.  Each authority wanted to be the one in charge.

What’s wrong with us?  We would be notified if bombs are falling, if a gas leak occurs in our neighborhood, if a wildfire is threatening our homes.  Why can’t we have an effective system to notify us of a very personal and public health threat.  Are we saying that our individual privacy is more important than the health of those around us.

The stories, as I remember, seemed more about pointing the infected person, of whom the authorities were well aware, to available social services.  That is a good service, but is pretty light on the tracking function.

Americans do not like government agencies tracking them.  If your solution entails that process, it won’t get much done.  Next time, don’t bother.  Confine it to the social service awareness function."
2021-05-27 15:27,"Nowhere in this story was there mention of the main reason these attempts failed: people don’t trust these big companies. They believe, from experience, that their personal information will be used - without their knowledge or permission - to target advertising, deceive, sell for profit, etc. The word “trust” did not appear once in the article. I don’t care that these apps could be trusted or are useful. Nobody believes that."

2021-05-27 15:35,I salute both Apple and Google for setting aside business rivalry and developing this app. The fact that so few people couldn't be bothered to download the app (or simply toggle it on with the iPhone) is not their fault. I have CANotify on my iPhone and did it just to be part of the solution.
2021-05-27 16:20,"New Zealand has a contact tracing App and it works. This app has been an essential tool in stopping any spread of community transmission of the virus, whenever there is evidence of community transmission.
I wouldn't blame the app but lack of good planning and contact tracing by government departments in USA. Our central government plays an important part in ensuring the app and co-ordination works whenever there has been a community outbreak of covid-19. Without this app we'd just be like all the other nations that have community transmission.
We have only had small lockdowns and it's life as usual in NZ and we're free to go anywhere.
Trump is to blame for USA not being organised to deal with the pandemic and community transmission as he said covid-19 was just another flu and never wore a mask. If government departments are underfunded then they can't function as they should when it comes to contact tracing."
2021-05-27 16:53,"I tried to download the Apple app/Virginia notification a few times. Each time, the app said it could not install on my Apple 6 and would require a newer device. My Apple 6 has perfectly reliable BlueTooth. It is pitiful that Apple could not be bothered to make a version that works on phones only a few years old. I think there are alot like myself who don't upgrade unless there is a compelling reason. Not everyone wanted to jump on the latest 1000$ Xphone."
2021-05-27 17:52,"One might think that a significant likelihood of a $3,000 surprise bill for a ""free"" COVID test might have something to do with the breakdown of the contact tracing efforts in the US."
2021-05-27 19:06,"Aside from privacy concerns, there's the question of the cost/benefit of how many people would get tested and run around from just-in-case thresholds of what counts being out and about.

If it pings your phone because a masked carrier stood 5 1/2 feet away from masked you in the grocery store line  instead of 6' 1"" and counted as an exposure, if you're an honest person you can't go to work even though the odds of infection are remote.  Get a test, wait, and possibly get told even it's negative sometimes it's wrong so stay home anyway. I can see how many people may think it's more trouble than it's worth."

2021-05-27 16:09,"When I read the headline I was thinking it was about computer security virus like ESET! lol!
In New Zealand they have some scanning app for people to scan before they go into any building or community event. I don't own a cell phone and wear a face mask so that's my app.
That sort of system is working well in NZ so ask our government about their system. It proves essential when ever we have had community transmission and has proven to work in practice. Our central government has lots of brain storming ads on TV and radio telling people to scan the code  and the government even monitors how many people are using the app. If people get slack and the numbers aren't up then the central government starts advertising campaigns to scan the code."
2021-05-27 13:15,Perhaps they should have just used the advertisement data tracking business model that people already allow to invade their privacy.
2021-05-27 14:20,Both companies are only good at ripping off content and putting paywalls around it (Apple) or slapping ads on it (Google). Who would have thought that when it came to coming up with their own ideas and products that actually worked they'd completely fail?
2021-05-27 15:47,"Why does the Times single out Google and Apple in the headline, when a lot, if not most, of the issues with the tracing apps were State / Local Govt. and user level issues?

Sure, this wasn’t perfect but it was a first attempt and will be a learning experience.  Also, if the apps did have real, user name, location tracking the New York Times would be screaming foul at the top of their lungs over compromised personal user data.

So, enough with the endless tech bashing.  Since you guys are so smart, please help with some potential solutions instead of the endless complaining and arm-chair quarter backing.  It’s sad to see how lame and irrelevant this news organization has become."

2021-05-27 18:48,This is so sad that State and County health departments did such a horrible job at contact tracing considering how superior our technology is.  When a human being ventures into public space they are constantly monitored by GPS and cameras.  We need to get over this invasion of privacy scare and learn how to use our technology for the greater good!  SHAME SHAME SHAME on all you nervous nellies!
2021-05-27 14:02,"it might be a question of where to focus your energies. It was never possible to track all cases in the United States, so the CDC was always prioritizing. It makes sense that among the cases among vaccinated people, the severe ones are more important to collect and document, so this change makes sense.
There is also another reason not to collect milder cases: hearing about those cases might discourage people from getting vaccinated. Whenever you hear about a vaccinated person catching covid, it sends the message that the vaccine isn't effective. It requires a lot of reading and looking at numbers to get the full picture. Let's not confuse a population that is already incredibly skeptical of vaccines.
Whether these milder cases are transmissible or not or have lasting effects (""long covid"") remains to be seen but is kind of conjecture. (A few weeks of lingering fatigue is not long covid) 
It also doesn't seem like the ""breakthrough"" infections are more likely to be specific variants, based on the current data from what I have read. 
It would certainly be good to have as much data on this as possible, but we have to be realistic about what is possible, and where the manpower is best put to use."
2021-05-27 14:07,"I don't see how it is not an urgent concern to investigate outbreaks involving multiple vaccinated people.

It is crucial to determine whether there is spread from vaccinated people, and outbreaks with multiple vaccinated people certainly make it look like it is possible.

Failure to investigate that puts the immunocompromised at serious risk.

This looks to me more like the CDC is buying their heads in the sand just like they did at the start of the pandemic."
2021-05-27 14:15,"I support this change. There is an almost infinite number of research threads on COVID that we could follow, many questions that I am curious about myself, but the manpower and money is finite."
2021-05-27 14:22,"We'll see how many continue to be infected whilst fully vaccinated. Those that have been banned from reporting their concerns (banned on social media) about this situation makes one wonder why they have been silenced, when this is one of the reasons they have been silenced. Let's hope NYtimes can be an honest reporting mechanism in this regard."
2021-05-27 14:55,"How about commenting on which vaccines are resulting in breakthrough cases?  The Yankees were all vaccinated with the J&J adenovirus vaccine, which only involves one dose.  It would be pretty important to ascertain whether the two dose mRNA vaccines (Moderna and Pfizer), which have shown slightly more efficacy, are also resulting in large numbers of breakthrough cases."
2021-05-27 14:58,"We have limited resources and it’s probably better to invest in getting the vaccine-intransigents on board, first. Once we’ve crossed a basic threshold of herd immunity and  civic responsibility, then we can move to the more marginal concerns."
2021-05-27 15:14,"There also seems to be no way to report my case, which was a lingering fatigue, with many of the symptoms of long haul covid which lasted for more than two months after I received my second vaccination. Though mostly better, I still have days of total fatigue that I never previously experienced."
2021-05-27 15:11,"I am having less and less trust in the CDC. Just putting the data out to get people to take the shot, but not telling people the problems that can occur when you do get Covid-19 after being immunized. People died. My mom and a brother died from Covid-19. Quietly changing your protocol. Tell the truth, the whole truth. A half truth is nothing but a lie."
2021-05-27 14:56,I learned about this CDC decision on May 10th and wondered why no main-stream media seemed to pick up the story.  Certainly data on the reinfection of the fully vaccinated is an urgent concern and should be monitored.
2021-05-27 15:17,"Thank you for this excellent reporting.
The CDC and other agencies need to keep track of all relevant information regarding the results of vaccination.
This is still a very early stage in this vaccination process and I fear that the government agencies do not want to scare people away from taking the shot-- because they may get the virus down the road. And what is worse even if the virus is mild re symptoms at first --later they can develop long term affects of the virus and this should be scientifically tracked."

2021-05-27 15:36,"Let’s not get the idea that breakthrough infection is too rare, as this possibility is why we need to get people age 12 and up to the clinic while we’re in our “summer lull.” Mass vaccination is what will keep those cases and deaths trending down so we’re less likely to be exposed to Covid in the first place.

That said, I’m impressed with the new mRNA-lipid nanoparticle technology and the efficacy numbers it has yielded, well over 90% reduction in probability of developing serious illness from Covid if one is vaccinated. All happening in the midst of a pandemic, first sequenced genome of a brand-new virus to the first public shots for it in 11 months. It was like science fiction. I want to thank everyone on this campaign, including the people who took out the mountains of trash after each day’s clinics."
2021-05-27 15:39,"""Now, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has stopped investigating breakthrough infections among fully vaccinated people unless they become so sick that they are hospitalized or die.""

Does this mean that the CDC won't even keep track of the *number* of fully vaccinated people who get a breakthrough infection? If so, then they are doing a disservice to those of us who want to know which of the three vaccines have the highest efficacy. 

Or, to put this another way ... how will the CDC know whether or when to recommend a ""booster"" shot? And, for those of us who followed the guidance to take whichever vaccine was made available to us, and got the least efficacious J&J vaccine: when can w feel confident spending time indoors in public settings?"
2021-05-27 15:46,"I was wondering about commenting on this piece when it was first published two days ago. As a scientist, I find this announcement literally shocking. How can you NOT collect these data?! Isn’t it critical to know whether certain vaccines are leading to more breakthrough infections than others? This is exactly the sort of decision that has left the public less trustful of the CDC and public health sources!"
2021-05-27 15:47,"with vaccinations rolled out as quickly as they have been, it seems like tracking post vaccine cases in people is essential...at least to see if there is 1 vaccine company, or 1 provider that is perhaps not following protocol...for storage, for manufacture, for anything else that could affect effectiveness.  if all bears out as fine, great but be more up front with potential illness...just because they have not required hospitalization doesn't me the severity cannot be life changing."
2021-05-27 16:36,"Thanks for this very important story by Roni Rabin. Even if every post-vax case can't be tracked, there should be well-planned sampling around the country to provide info on waning protection, spreading variants, differences among vaccines,  and unforeseen changes. 

Also, as society reopens, it is important for people to remain aware that vaccination does not provide absolute 100% protection. This is not a ""mixed message."" It is a simple truth that people can understand. Seatbelts save lives, but some people who wear them still die in auto accidents."
2021-05-27 16:47,This is the sort of cost-cutting and willful ignorance we expected from the CDC under the last administration. We expect far better now.
2021-05-27 17:26,"CDC‘s pro-vaccine agenda is becoming more and more apparent. CDC defined and tracked Covid cases from the outset of the pandemic defined simply as a positive PCR test only, with no consideration of symptoms required, let alone hospitalization or death￼. Now when EUA vaccines are involved they are basically defining a case as one that requires hospitalization or death, an incredibly higher bar for what qualifies as a case, and it is hard to see how this isn’t simply a consequence of there being a vaccine involved and CDC not wanting it to seem like there are a lot of cases involved after vaccination. Suspicious?￼￼￼"
2021-05-27 17:34,"The rollout of info from the CDC continues to be confounding. They need a narrative other than ""Guess what we're thinking with this drastic change of course!"" For instance, the masking guidelines might have been rolled out in stages a few weeks back. As an educator, I can almost guarantee the listening comprehension dwindled significantly after most ""No masks!"" headlines (if some continued reading at all). In our soundbite world, it would help to simplify and meme. Is there not at least one scientist at the CDC with a creative bent on massaging? This headline startled and alarmed me. As others have noted, the ""mild case with long haul symptoms"" contingency would appreciate all available data, please."
2021-05-27 17:40,"As a person who has experienced long term health effects after having other viral illnesses, I find the break through case with the long lasting effects to be very worrisome.  I'd like to have an idea about how often break through cases turn into long haul situations. 

Also wouldn't it be useful to know what percentages of breakthrough cases are leading to hospitalization and death?  I could see making the decision to stop looking at mild breakthrough cases in a year or so.  However, considering about half the vaccines have been administered in the last 3 months, it seems a bit premature to stop looking so soon especially now when they've just dropped the mask mandate for fully vaccinated people."
2021-05-27 18:09,"It seems CDC prefers to look the other way when it comes to negative outcomes associated with the COVID-19 vaccines.

I believe the only reason they momentarily posed the J&J vaccine is because of the European Medicine Agency's announcement of an investigation into the issue.

There is hardly any acknowledgement/discussion of severe adverse reactions and fatalities associated with the covid vaccines from the CDC, the medical establishment, or the pharmaceutical companies (Moderna, Pfizer-BioNTech, J&J).

Where is the transparency?

The system has pretty much abandoned anyone who was unfortunate enough to have experienced a bad outcome.  

The lack of a national healthcare system and a real safety net had forced some vaccinated individuals to resort to ""Go fund me"" to help pay for expenses after they experienced adverse reactions that send them to the ER and/or caused them to be hospitalized."
2021-05-27 18:40,"I was vaccinated (J&J) for over 30 days before testing positive for COVID in early April, then spent 16 days in the hospital due to breathing difficulty and later TIAs.  After dealing with COVID and complications for more than 6 weeks, I am still not back to normal as the end of May approaches.  Only yesterday did someone from VSafe contact me about my illness, and they were interested in information about reaction to the vaccine only.  Local doctors that treated me, the local health department, state health department, nor CDC were interested in hearing anything about my breakthrough infection and subsequent complications, so I don't know if my case even made it into the numbers.  At this point I don't know why the vaccine did not work for me, if a variant was involved, or if I should get an alternate vaccine.  There's certainly more research to be done, and I would even volunteer to participate in studies of breakthrough infections... but no one seems to care."
2021-05-27 18:47,"It seems like the outside epidemiologists have the better argument here. Even if the case is non-serious, wouldn't it still provide data on vaccine efficacy? By necessity, the process had to be fast-tracked and it seems like there is still a lot we don't know about COVID transmission and the vaccines developed with a lot of new techniques. Wouldn't this be useful information not just for COVID-19 but for the""Next Big One?"""
2021-05-27 19:43,"The CDC knows it cannot accurately count breakthrough cases as most people will not even get tested. My take is they decided to set the bar higher so that the number would be an accurate indicator of more severe illness. 
I would like info in all breakthrough cases but am not sure whether it would be useful if it were 1) grossly undercounted and 2) a number so large that the CDC could not follow up on all cases. 
Perhaps the populations in which it is tracked (e.g. healthcare workers) will give us the data we need on at least some of the vaccines."
2021-05-27 19:53,"I think people don't understand that there are many variables that would have to be determined for the information to be useful.

-Just 'being vaccinated' doesn't tell us whether antibodies were developed or how strong. 
-It doesn't tell us whether not developing antibodies was the result of some issue in the patient or the particular batch or the jab itself.
-It doesn't tell us what the viral load exposure was that caused the problem.
-I don't think we know yet what individual characteristics of the person lead to 'long covid' or other presentations.

Biology isn't my field, but my inclination would be to use all available resources to investigate the serious cases more in depth... perhaps getting some answers to the above... since what is learned there would likely apply to the general population and milder cases.

Too much data can easily come with too much noise, hiding the signal."
2021-05-27 20:41,I don’t think breakthrough infections are as rare as they are claiming. A friend of mine who has been fully vaccinated with Pfizer for a month and is 8 months pregnant just got covid. She was feeling mildly ill and got tested and now a case like hers which could provide very valuable data won’t be tracked? Senseless.
2021-05-27 21:53,"To have control of the data, it makes sense to limit it to the serious, hospital cases, and do genetic testing on the cases resulting in death. 

Otherwise, you have no control of the data from the myriad of health care ""stations"" which is points to a problem--our lack of a database connected with a national healthcare system."
2021-05-27 21:08,Wow! Sounds like you now have to take everything from the post T CDC with a teaspoon of salt...

a vaccine is not a magic shield a vaccine job is to train the body to deal with the covid virus, some people will be asymptomatic others will have mild symptoms and truly rare few will get sick.
But no one will die vaccines are 100% effective in preventing death. 
That 10K ,ild cases is less than 0.01% of total vaccinations vaccinations.

Covid can kill that is a fact, vaccines will prevent or make an infection much milder....be smart get vaccinated."
2021-05-24 13:19,"Adverse side effects should be widely reported, especially since it seems to be so difficult to ""determine"" that they result from the vaccine shot."
2021-05-24 13:50,"One dose of the vaccine, especially in younger people providers plenty of protection. 

Given how terrible I felt after the second dose, I’m not surprised that some people, even if it’s a small number, had an even worse outcome.

The flu vaccine has different dosing regimens based on age. It’s likely we will move to that for these mRNA vaccines to avoid the incredibly strong immune response from the second dose, which can be, from my own experience, quite debilitating."
2021-05-24 14:21,A bout with myocarditis is serious but survivable; a Covid induced cytokine storm is more serious and quite possibly not survivable.
2021-05-24 14:20,"This is egregious and should have been reported to all and specific warnings should have been given to younger recipients much earlier.  Pfizer knew about this in April, if not before, and has been mum.   There were 62 cases reported in Israel in April, mostly in young men, and two deaths.   The deaths were in people who were reportedly in good health.   The suggestion of coincidence is beyond belief as it the reaction hits within 24-48 hours of the second vax.  While I am certainly a pro-vax person, this story as well as other stories of younger people’s strong reaction to the second dose leads me to believe that something is sadly and frighteningly amiss here. 

And Pfizer has a heck of a lot of explaining to do."
2021-05-24 13:34,"This is not new. NYT found the ACIP report buried on the CDC website. It should be on the page with the other adverse events. Cases of myocarditis & myopericarditis were initially brought to light in Israel and the EU, as was CVST and VITT. It’s seems the vaccine safety system in the US takes its cue to look from them. As of April 29 there were 14 cases reported to DOD and 148 cases reported to VAERS. The number of cases found by the VSD arm of our vaccine safety system is unknown as that data is not available to the public. The VAERS reports may be unvetted but the majority are very clinically descriptive including ECG changes, cardiac catheterizations, and eventually cardiac MR. Myocarditis can follow viral infections, in particular coxsackie B virus. But it has also been associated with the ACAM2000 small pox vaccine. Myocarditis in association with vaccines has been looked at by precision vaccinology research groups. The work focuses on adversomics where genetic markers or metabolites are identified as predictors of adverse events. The goal is to make vaccines safe on an individual basis. It’s tough research to do because of small numbers due to rare but serious conditions and reporting and recognizing issues. Committing to an adversomics program would require international cooperation. In  2017 the National Vaccine Advisory Committee discussed adversomics after hearing presentations on potential post vaccination myocarditis genetic markers. 4 years later here we are."

2021-05-24 12:32,"“At the moment, the number of cases of myocarditis reported after vaccination does not appear to be greater than would normally be seen in young people, according to the C.D.C.” Until there is an established link, or at least a corresponding rise in cases of myocarditis associated with vaccination in young people, I have concerns about the ethics of publishing articles like this. The idea that “correlation may equal causation” is at the heart of the anti-vaccine playbook for a reason. How many millions of Americans will now hesitate to vaccinate their children against a deadly virus, because of this reported (extremely rare and not as of yet causally linked) correlation?"
2021-05-24 15:06,My son is experiencing heart issues after getting the vaccine on May 12. He finally told us last night about his symptoms. I wonder if this condition is more widespread. Teenage boys are not very communicative. And it's frustrating that the CDC gave no information about what to look for until now.
2021-05-24 15:17,"It makes you wonder if one of the side effects from Covid vaccination, just like serious infection, may be a weakened heart.  Maybe the vaccines are just like doses of Covid - the first one a very low controlled dose so people with even the worst immune systems can handle it.  And the 2nd dose is stronger dose of Covid because the immune system learned a lot from the first dose of Covid (or vaccine).  That’s why a lot more people get sicker from the 2nd vaccine dose"
2021-05-24 15:38,Correlation does not imply causation.
2021-05-24 15:56,"I see no reason for young, healthy people to be injected with this experimental drug whose long-term health effects are entirely unknown. My friend told me a few weeks ago that his relative, a doctor in CA, was treating three young people for heart damage from the Pfizer vaccine.

This is a multibillion dollar industry by corrupt big pharma. Let's encourage health and building our immune systems naturally."
2021-05-24 16:29,"My husband developed Myocarditis after his 2nd Moderna shot. We thought he had a heart attack. He is 36, active, and very healthy. We are convinced this condition developed from the vaccine; it was not a random event.  Myocarditis has been linked to other vaccines and can be caused by viruses. Compared to the blood clots from J & J, the difference with this condition is that the typical method of treatment for Myocarditis is working, thank god. 

We should have been warned that Myocarditis is an adverse reaction. We should have been told what to look for.  We are still pro-vaccine, but Moderna and Phizer have a responsibility to state all adverse reactions, even if at this time they can not conclusively say it is directly linked. 

We have a toddler, and until there is more research about the link between Covid19 vaccines and Myocarditis, we not be vaccinating our child. This will be the first time we do not follow CDC recommendations for vaccines. We need more information."
2021-05-24 16:37,"The risk/ benefit ratio clearly favors the vaccine as the article points out. As I tell my patients, the choice one is making at this point in the pandemic is : 1) Get the vaccine (which has an extremely low side effect profile after over 100 million vaccinations in the US/ incredibly high protection against severe COVID illness and all its potential horrible complications (including DEATH and MYOCARDITIS). 2) Turn down the vaccine and take your chances with getting COVID at some point in the next 12mos. COVID will now be endemic in the global human population and if you are not vaccinated, the chance that you will get COVID is very, very high as we return to normalcy with no masks. Good luck with your decision. Myself, my wife, and my 12/ 14 yr old children have been vaccinated and as soon as it is approved, I will have my 8 yr old vaccinated as well. Every disease, vaccine, and medical treatment has risks.  The risk/ benefit ratio here in favor of the vaccine is not subtle!"
2021-05-24 16:52,"I am a healthy, active 47 y.o. woman sitting in the hospital from a severe myocarditis reaction to the 2nd Moderna covid shot. I too, would have liked to have known this potential risk. I doubt it would have prevented me from getting the vaccine because i had literally no risk factors."
2021-05-24 16:32,"The MSM is to be ""congratulated"" once again for overplaying another instance of a rare side effect of the Covid vaccine.

Something that the Twidiots will now spread across the wacko social networks.

How many more will now thus be ""persuaded"" to avoid vaccination?

Has anyone ever thought that for every reported vaccine ""problem"" there are now unnecessary deaths among the ""unvaccinated"" who become infected with Covid?

This kind of media reportage plays right into the hands of the anti-vaxxers, the QAnons and all the other lunatic groups out there."
2021-05-24 16:16,"Though the bias in this article for vaccinating young people is obvious, I was at least able to perform one simple calculation from the reporter's own facts and figures which were otherwise used primarily to support continuing those vaccinations.  And that is that the death rate for ""children"" (left undefined) infected by Covid is .0001%.  

Though the reporter does state that more children are ""hospitalized"" for Covid than are for the flu ""in an average year"", without more context (including even a simple statement of how many more were hospitalized), that's an almost meaningless comparison.

Tellingly, no comparison in death rates for children between Covid and even an ""average"" flu year is offered. 

My point is that anyone who has analyzed the issue dispassionately has acknowledged that the primary beneficiaries of vaccinating young people are adults as herd immunity is, thus, more easily achieved.  To me, it seems that almost ANY harm to young people as a result of these new technology vaccines is as if we are sacrificing the health of the young because of the refusal of their elders to get vaccinated.

To, that's beyond selfish."

He had developed Pneumonia, Sepsis, Kidney failure and Afib. He was on the vent for 2 1/2 days.  Spent a total of 7 days in the hospital. He had Covid 19 the previous year and was only mildly sick for 2 days. 
Its time that the truth about these vaccines to come out! Everyone needs to know what can possibly happen when you take it."
2021-05-24 18:17,"It was reckless and premature for Dr. Gounder to simply say that it was coincidental and/or by chance that a young person developed a myocarditis after getting a Pfizer/Moderna vaccine. It's infuriating when someone says that without further investigating the matter. Evidently, she is protecting COVID-19 vaccine's reputation. After a year and a half in the pandemic, it is clear to me that Pfizer/Moderna company have no bloody clue what their mRNA vaccine will do to a person's long term health other than providing protection from the virus. And most recently Pfizer CEO suggested that people will require a 2nd booster shot in 6-12 mos after receiving the 1st booster shot. I am not surprised that 60% of Americans are not vaccinated...yet."
2021-05-24 18:45,"I got my Pfizer vaccine and developed pericarditis after it. It was pretty frightening considering I'm a very healthy 33 year old. I was told that it usually is triggered from viruses when I went to the ER for it, although, I had not been sick with anything. I'm glad there is some transparency on the matter now."
2021-05-24 19:35,Have dealt with Big Pharma for many years.Not surprised at their reaction to these side effects from COVID vaccines.Big Pharma's first priority is profit not patient safety.Big Pharma will suppress /downplay the negative data for several years.The truly sad part is the CDC and FDA usually bow to pressure from Big Pharma and their lobbyists.I won't bore you with the worst mistakes made by Big Pharma and there are many.
2021-05-24 17:38,This is a vaccine safety evaluation integrity problem. The FDA and the CDC ACIP knew about these post vaccine myocarditis cases but granted Pfizer a revision of their EUA to begin vaccinating adolescents anyway. The report of cases in Israel broke in late April. The FDA extended the EUA May 10 and the CDC ACIP met and supported the extension on May 12. Then the warning went up sometime after May 17th. Why did they not pause the EUA extension until the cases were reviewed? That should be the question.
2021-05-24 20:26,"Dear First World Citizens,
If you don't want to take the vaccine that can save your life, please send it to the Developing World where there is abundant supply of sane people waiting for their shots.

2021-05-24 22:40,"I’m a bit worried about the slowdown in our nation’s vaccination campaign and some of the comments on this page. It’s our old friend, the availability heuristic, where a plane crashes so people are afraid to fly, and a vaccinee has an episode of heart inflammation so people avoid their shots. The heuristic itself is useful. If people start falling to the ground around me, I’d be foolish not to wonder why that was happening. But Utah hears about the myocarditis even though it’s in Zanesville, Ohio and we get tempted to think it more common than it really is. And we link it to Pfizer because it’s on the CDC vaccine website.

And the problem is worse now that Covid vaccines have become a GOP political issue amid what was already a growing anti-vax movement. I’m hoping people will set this hoopla aside and ask their doctors about the shots, and follow their doctors’ advice on it. None of the folks on my street who got Covid last winter said it was fun, and one of them had to call the ambulance."
2021-05-25 0:19,My 12 and 14 year old grandchildren received their first Pfizer shots last Tuesday. They won't be going back for the second until more is known. We think that there should be a pause vaccinating this age group until there are answers. These are our children not guinea pigs.
2021-05-24 23:05,Sloppy. Sloppy. Sloppy. Big pharma companies can always say well side effects are minor compared to getting Covid. Just as cops say I felt my life was in danger. Both cases operate under qualified immunity
2021-05-25 1:02,"It will be interesting to see how the risk/benefit analysis of vaccinating young children will shake out. As children are not major vectors of virus transmission, the primary benefit of vaccinating them would be to the individual child, not society as it is for adults. The risk of death/complications for a young, healthy child is very, very low. Data is coming out showing that most cases of long COVID in children is also largely resolved within a couple of months of infection. How will these incredibly low risks compare with the risks of the vaccine? I will be waiting to vaccinate my kindergartener and toddler until more data is available so that I can make an educated decision. The risk/benefit ratio for vaccinating adults under EUA made sense to me. Vaccinating my two-year-old under EUA is less convincing."
2021-05-25 1:59,"The problem is that we have culturally fallen into two camps the 'science is real' camp and the 'science is what I say' camp. It's an impossible place to be in, as a society. I believe covid can be deadly for certain groups and that it is real. I wear my mask. I also feel the tremendous peer pressure to vaccinate my child simply based on what my peers get from mainstream media. When I dare voice my concerns, all I get is a 'we believe in science, don't you?' Guess what? Science takes time. Science evolves, is dynamic, it is not dogma. There is more that we don't know about covid than what we know. Researchers constantly find things out and that changes how we treat or prevent disease in general. We stopped using arsenic as skin whitener and strychnine as 'tonics' as early as the 1940s. These vaccines are new. Children are not a risk group and the long-term consequences of this technology on their bodies are unknown. I am not vaccinating my child with any genetic vaccine until science tells me that the long-term risks are not there. I wish more $ was put into different vaccination technologies - whole inactivated virus or protein subunit. As it is, in the US, we are the prisoners of Pfizer, Moderna, JJ or nothing."
2021-05-25 2:46,"I have been pro-science and pro-vaccines my whole adult life, but I will be waiting to vaccinate my kids until after the vaccines have received full (not emergency) authorization. 

Children have contributed very little to pandemic spread relative to adults. This has become undeniable in recent weeks as the virus has declined with only adults being vaccinated.

The risk/benefit calculus is fundamentally different for kids than it is for adults, and all adults can protect themselves now with vaccines."
2021-05-25 2:39,"Wonder if the investigation includes the possibility the children involved had COVID without knowing it at the time of getting the vaccine. Last summer initial evaluations raised the possibility that 15% of athletes with COVID, even in asymptomatic cases, developed myocarditis. Recent studies which include MRIs show the percentage is about 3%. Ages 0-19 currently make up 30% of the daily positive cases in my county, where transmission is still considered high by CDC guidelines. <a href=""https://www.diagnosticimaging.com/view/cardiac-mri-shows-less-myocarditis-in-athletes-post-covid-19-than-previously-reported"" target=""_blank"">https://www.diagnosticimaging.com/view/cardiac-mri-shows-less-myocarditis-in-athletes-post-covid-19-than-previously-reported</a>"

A friend of mine works as a tech at a veterinarian office.  She said one of their clients brought in her cat and wanted it euthanized because she had read articles about felines getting COVID and was terrified she would get it from her cat.  She promptly left the cat and then the office.

My friend's mother adopted that cat a few days later, after it was thoroughly examined and checked out by the vet.

A coronavirus that is associated with infecting dogs is not in itself a big concern. However, take that dog coronavirus, run it through laboratory experiments that purposely increase its ability to infect and its lethality, then you definitely do have an issue. 
    Laboratories working with infectious agents need to be tightly supervised, there’s just too much at stake if and when virus lab experiments run amok as is increasingly suspected to have happened at Wuhan"
2021-05-21 20:10,"The number of different species that can be infected with ""our"" COVID-19 is surprisingly large. Lions, tigers, cats, dogs, bank voles, ferrets, fruit bats, hamsters, mink, pigs, rabbits, racoon dogs, tree shrews, and white-tailed deer are among those known to be able to become infected by it. 

This large, and growing list also suggests that a jump to humans from animals is very likely.  While it does not refute the ""lab-generated"" speculation, it does suggest a large number of potential host species that could have incubated this virus before it jumped to humans."
2021-05-21 23:47,"Of course germs can jump from species to species. Since the only close exposure many of us have to animals is our pets, it's only natural that this could happen. It certainly is no reason to panic; nothing is going to separate me from my two pit bull mixes."

This kind of non-factual reporting serves no purpose other than to unnecessarily frighten people."
2021-05-21 14:21,"As the article states, ""Others say that public health is intrinsically tied to the legitimacy of the state promoting it.""

China has demonstrated with its successful fight against COVID-19 that the PRC is viewed by the Chinese people as the legitimate state authority and as Dr. Legleiter added public health messaging only penetrates if the public identifies with or trusts that figure of authority. In China that figure of authority is the Communist Party led by President Xi Jinping.

So, why isn't that acknowledged in the article?"

Indeed, US is the sick man of the world. We are the only industrialized country where people go bankrupt because of sickness or injury. We spend more per capital on healthcare, yet have one of the worst outcomes. Our average life span is shortening. Covid-19 really made bare the shortcomings of our health system. This is a great opportunity to revamp and restructure the entire health system in the US towards the right direction—universal coverage and regulated pricing. Healthcare is a right; it shouldn’t be for extreme profit."

Former POTUS didn't help and he should have given the medical and science profession full commands and stay safely out of political harm and ridicule. But one thing that I kept thinking about was that indeed China was making progress by the week, probably due to the intense sense of discipline Chinese and Asians in general are known for: we like to think that the Chinese 'fear' their government but actually I'd say they also have a deep respect and trust for it, especially in a matter with so much history behind it as this article relates. At no time during the early months of the pandemic did I hear that any of the Western countries was going to emulate China, or take a page from their history books, and try out whatever was working. Didn't happen: in the US, 50 different states all going their own way was the recipe for the disaster that we all witnessed."
2021-05-21 16:45,"I find the title of this article befuddling. It says ""What can and cannot be learned from a doctor in China."" The article seems to be either dismissive of Dr. Wu or missing the point when the author says: ""a single individual can’t save a nation."" I don't feel that Dr. Wu Lien-Teh or anyone claimed that he alone saved China. Also, even Dr. Alexandre White of Johns Hopkins makes it clear that the message is about countries like the U.S. ""need to reckon with their inequitable and fraught public health systems"" and not about Dr. Wu being the ""superhero."" I am happy to know of Dr. Wu's existence. He did China a big favor as a citizen of Malaysia."

Dr. Wu Lien-Teh deserves the recognition given in this article as well as a flag to all humanity thar caring knows no ethnic boundaries.  It is probably safe to say that in the 1918 Spanish Flu Pandemic, things may have been more lethal without a simple face mask.  And here we are a little over 120 years later facing another pandemic that face masks are acting as a primary weapon of defense against COVID-19.  Those that do not be;ieve or refuse to believe in the reality of this pandemic by not wearing masks should have this as required reading.

Frankly, i believe the relaxation of the CDC’s and the Federal, State, and Local government’s recommendation to wear masks is very premature given that  there is still a significant population who have not received vaccinations for whatever their reasons are; therefore, the potential is for increased infections and death are still very much real.  We have not even determined yet the length of efficacy of the current vaccines and there is still the threat of mutations that rather than becoming less viral, are in fact even more deadly.

But, this article is about one doctor who did make a difference all through his life.  Its is a great tribute to Dr. Wu Lien-Teh."

Australia is often referred to as a ‘nanny state,’ where it’s citizens closely follow government directives. They pride themselves on their response to the pandemic, especially when compared with the US. But I fear this pride is clouding their judgment.

Before covid, we intended to move back to Australia within 12-24 months, but like the example in the article, we are changing our future plans. My husband is under application for American citizenship, and we applied for (and looks like we may get) the NYC holy grail... a rent stabilized apartment. 

In many ways Australia has superior social services, but covid has highlighted some overreaching Australian policy...  prolonged and severe restrictions on movement within the country, closed borders (even to their own citizens), inability to travel outside the country (even with a good reason), and an anemic fiscal response. And their vaccine rollout was built on nationalist ‘go it alone’ pride, and it failed miserably. 

Living in NYC we were both able to access generous unemployment benefits, ample covid testing and a robust vaccine rollout. Back in Aus only one family member has been able to get the vaccine. My husbands mother who is a nurse. 

We can’t wait to get back to Australia to see our family and friends, but when it finally happens it will be for a visit instead of a relocation."
2021-05-19 18:24,"“But the slow pace of vaccination is adding to the frustration.”
Slow pace and frustration doesn’t begin to describe it.  After promising that “Australians would be at the front of the queue” and a rapid rollout (more a strollout)  as vaccination target after target was not met, due to late supply and bad planning, the Government refused to publish any further targets and momentum was lost. 
The Astra-Zeneca and Pfizer vaccines have both being procured with the A-Z vaccine also being locally manufactured. Both procurements and the manufacture ran late. Then with the very rare possibility of side effects of the A-Z (more likely in the young, but still possible in the old) the A-Z was not recommended for the under 50 and has the reputation of not being as good as Pfizer There isn’t much Pfizer, which got given to aged care residents; front line workers under 50 (Medical staff, emergency) are getting it. 
So if you are under 50 and not in a priority group, there is no recommended vaccine and if you are over 50 the A-Z is all that is on offer; more Pfizer and Moderna and possibly Novavax are being procured for later this year so you have to wait. I think some over 50 people are waiting for the Pfizer/Moderna and those in their early 50s have a dilemma. The UK A-Z age cutoff of 30 is because the risk of Covid there outweighs vaccine complication risk.

I’m (un)comfortably in the 50+. group, I got my A-Z shot earlier this week which was about as soon as I could get it."

2021-05-19 18:59,"As a (fully vaccinated) long-time expatriate Australian living in the US, I see the Aust. government has put themselves in a bind, as a sort of victim of their own success in reducing infection to a negligible level.

There is next to no acquired immunity in the population, and there appears to be little chance they will, at the present rate, achieve anything approaching herd immunity through vaccination. Many people just don't see an urgent need to get vaccinated when there is such low risk of getting infected, and there is also (excessive) concern about the risks associated with the vaccines. Slow rollout of the vaccines may no longer be the key issue.

With this situation, along with general freedom of movement internally, to open the borders even slightly (meaning without full government-managed quarantine for incoming people) is to risk a major outbreak. Expanding quarantine facilities is a challenge (although this should have been pursued more aggressively long ago), as ordinary mass accommodation facilities (such as hotels) are ill-suited to containing spread of an airborne virus, without at least major modifications to ventilation systems. Meantime, new variants are continuing to appear, and may pose even greater risks.

What I think is needed is a strong carrot and stick approach to encouraging people to get vaccinated, preferably using the most effective vaccines."
2021-05-19 17:24,2022? What madness. At a certain point you have to weigh the risks and get back to business as usual. There will continue to be deaths due to COVID but once your population is mostly vaccinated it’s time to move on.

Until 70-80%of the world  people including children get vaccinated , I think they are continuing in th right direction. At the same time, it is necessary to make sure Australian people do not suffer an increase in Emotional / mental issues like depression and anxiety and they need to find a way to make up the revenue lost from the tourist trade"

As an Aussie family living in California we made the decision to ride it out here and wait for things to settle down in order to head back to home. Now here we are mid way through 2021 and the roles have been reversed. We are fully vaccinated and proud of the way the Americans have rebounded - now watching the occurrences back home we are rethinking our plans of relocating home. 

There is so much to consider: Work permits to stay in the US, freedom to come and go in Australia, kids schooling, the shipping goods crisis, quarantine. Please let it all stop, we are all so over it!"

I tried to fly down under this year to support the family of my dying uncle. In January 2021 exemption was refused because he's not dead yet (I was shocked to get this answer). This month he died, and when I tried to get an exemption to go to the funeral, it got denied again. This time because of some inbound quota on repatriation flights.

I don't have Covid, have been vaccinated and I'm more than willing to even go into quarantine in Australia. Please someone explain this rationale."
2021-05-19 19:51,"I am an Australian who has been living in the United States for the past 5 years. I was initially proud of the way Australia handled the pandemic but now a significant percentage of the population are rejecting the vaccines and would rather see the borders remain closed until the risk has been reduced to zero.  At some point, the economic reality will mean the borders have to open. Their early success managing the pandemic makes it hard for them to accept the unavoidable consequences of opening the borders - even to vaccinated citizens and visitors. There will be infections and there will be deaths - a very small number amongst the vaccinated and a larger number amongst the unvaccinated and  immunocompromised. 

In the meantime, the Australian Government treated its citizens living overseas in an appalling manner.  I can empathize with the London-based solicitor, I also know longer recognize my country or its values and I have applied for US citizenship.  Yes, there are major problems here but at least I’ll be the citizen of a country that values its nationals."

All I'll say is that, as an American expat who watched in horror at the U.S. response to the pandemic from abroad, I was proud as hell I could fly home to the U.S. in December, at the peak of infections, on a very short notice, to visit with my mother a few weeks before she passed away to ovarian cancer. When I landed in the U.S. nobody even was concerned I was flying from Europe, which was still under a travel ban. It was at that moment I thought, ""So glad I'm not Australian!""

2021-05-19 20:14,"Australia's treatment of its overseas citizens is not only embarrassing - it's a human rights violation. The extended mandate of closed borders, mandatory detention and a slow vaccination uptake with no end goal is a political play set to win the votes of a racist country. 

Throughout Australia's short modern history since colonization; the obvious lack of regard for human rights - especially international - is displayed time and time again. 

The penchant for detention and limited arrivals of the 'other' has been seen in Australia's xenophobic past (the Stolen Generation; mandatory off-shore detention and cruel treatment of migrants and refugees arriving by boat). This similar theory of detention as a strategy to win votes plays on the racist undercurrents that are rife in a conservative and insular country.  The treatment of Australians trying to repatriate from India is reminiscent of a 'White Australia Policy'. 

Australia has no Bill of Rights or constitutional protections or obligations for human rights to question its current actions and treatment of overseas citizens. The need for such as a foundational tenant for policy has never been so obvious.

If you're a celebrity, the rules don't apply. 

As an Australian living overseas, I was always proud of my country and proud to be Australian. I am, as always, thankful for what this country has given me. However, I've lost faith in the system of government and what it can provide for the future of our country."

Before we had highly effective vaccines, well-established testing protocols, and knowledge about the course and duration of SARS-CoV-2 infection, these kind of policies made complete sense.

That said, I would trade the above policies for the asinine response that occurred in the U.S. any day of the week."

Some of the stories are heartbreaking with family losses and missed milestones.  International crews have to jump thru hoops of fire in order to contain our “cooties” from spreading and it has certainly worked. I look out of my crew bus and hermetically sealed hotel windows to see that life has been normal for them throughout the pandemic, of course they don’t find it necessary to vaccinate.  When the economic globe starts spinning again and they are forced to pay higher prices on virtually all imported products, their currency has stagnated how do they recover then? As much as many countries would like to stay in a bubble the reality is that they can’t without suffering economic hardship and isolation. The Australian government needs set a date ( within this year) on when vaccines are required and just move on with life. By the way I am writing this as I sit in quarantine in my hotel room at the SYD airport."

Don't get me wrong. New Yorkers, in some ways, remind me a lot of Aussies (which is why I so much enjoy reading ""Metropolitan Diary""). But the cultural idiom in much of the U.S. seems closer something I'd call hateship. Australia with a nasty chip on its shoulder. A breakdown in the bonds that hold us together. Rampant identity politics. Anomie.

His short term, political instincts combined with extremely limited skill at management of complex ideas and systems are creating a chaotic and tragic future.

There's plenty of science to support vaccines and their effect on reducing risk of transmission, even against newer variants. Come on mates, keep up to date.

2021-05-19 20:34,"Australia apparently cannot vaccinate enough people to remove the threat of a runaway pandemic. But if the Australian government is not doing all that it can to vaccinate it's people, then it should consider that in addition to COVID-19 and it's variants there are many other mutating pathogens which are also being kept out, including common flu viruses. When Australia opens, it's population will be exposed to all of them besides COVID. It's likely to produce a year of people getting sick and skipping work."
2021-05-19 20:35,"Closing the borders worked so brilliantly that Australians failed to understand this  was just the first step of an effective strategy. Step two, getting everyone vaccinated as quickly as possible, has been a nightmare. Dividing people up into age groups which get different vaccines has created a bureaucratic bottleneck. And many selfish people are reluctant to have Astra Zeneca, saying they will wait until an MRNA option comes along.
In the meantime, we just don’t have enough immunity to reopen international borders. 
It’s a terrible look and the prime minister should accept the blame. 
Could I please urge Australians wanting to return to remain patient. A terrible mistake has been made and it will be rectified in time. Many expatriates accusing Australia of heartlessness should ask themselves why they chose not to return when there was an opportunity to do so early last year. They chose to sit it out and this was always going to be a gamble.
Like so many problems in life, this is not a hateful conspiracy but a failure of leadership. Stay safe, get the vaccine. We’ll eventually come out the other side."
2021-05-19 20:28,"I’m a yank that lived and worked in Sydney from 2011 -2016 I loved it and miss it big time. Just a few days ago my Australian ex-girlfriend messaged me asking if she should do the Astra Zeneca vaccine with the extremely remote possibility of blood clots or wait for the Moderna vaccine later in the year. I told her with zero community spread it was not an irrational choice to wait so that might be another reason behind the vaccine hesitancy. 

Now onto staying closed until mid 2022 that is crazy and will hurt OZ economically and potentially be the end of Qantas the home airline where I have friends working. I would think the number of Aussie who want to go to Bali or Thailand for holiday will cause a rethink of mid 2022 border reopening. But the current government is the conservatives and they have a tendency to want to lock the “other” out so not so surprising."
2021-05-19 21:41,"""Some medical experts and politicians have called for vaccine targets to be linked to border reopenings.""

It's pretty weird that this, which I think would be the most pertinent aspect of any border re-opening, is limited to ""some medical experts and politicians."" It is also weird that this discussion is buried in the middle of the article. It very much creates that sense the current Australian border closure is an issue driven by science and fact and more by political sentiments."
2021-05-19 21:42,"I’m an American living in Australia for the past 2 1/2 years.  Closing down during the initial stages of the pandemic was done masterfully, and the outbreaks that occurred subsequently have been very well managed as well.  Reopening has not matched that level of competence.  One gets the feeling that heavy betting on the Astra Zeneca vaccine and on a single local manufacturer have turned sour and the government has no alternative plan.  Many suspect this to be the case and are more angered by the lack of transparency than by a failed policy.  
There are many intermediate policies between a fully open border and the current restrictions.  Relaxed travel restrictions for those who have been vaccinated, e.g., might be an option.  Home quarantine might be another.  The Morrison government has refused thus far to even discuss the range of possible alternatives with the public.  The Australian economy is heavily dependent on travel and open borders, so the refusal to debate the policy is sitting badly with many."
2021-05-19 21:46,"It is funny to hear expats complaining about the Australian nanny state regarding border closures but then also expecting the Commonwealth Government to arrange/subsidise their flights home.
They all made the choice, many within the past 12 months, to go overseas for work, study or love. The government did not send them so there really is no obligation to bring them back.
I went to California for a few weeks in November 2019 for family reasons but I wouldn't have gone three months later.
And I am not a rabid supporter of the current conservative government but in this case, I think that they are doing the right thing.
Name another country with 120 active cases (all from overseas) that is facilitating the return of its citizens, however slowly.
Please expats, channel your inner American and pull yourselves up by your own bootstraps and deal with the travel restrictions."
2021-05-19 22:34,"Australia remains one of the luckiest countries - there has been minor disruptions to life in the last 12 months comparatively.  

We can afford to wait and watch on emergency vaccines and variants while we are safely protected at international border levels

It has been absolutely heartbreaking and gobsmacking at times that the USA suffered so intensely and for so long and didn’t make more serious assessment from the start - yes trump was your BIG problem but that then beggared belief as to how that occurred too !"
2021-05-19 22:35,"People seem to forget that the Government must do what is best for the majority, and it is not always possible to make everyone happy. 

Keeping the borders closed keeps the vast majority of 23 million or so of us safe (until we can all be vaccinated), to the detriment of maybe 100,000 who have made the choice to be overseas. This is the right decision. 

People seem to be forgetting how rapidly this virus can spread and how dangerous it is. Think back to the Melbourne outbreak and 800+ deaths as a result of poor management of international arrivals. Whatever we can do to avoid an outbreak collectively is worth the price we may pay individually. 

(And yes, I have close relatives overseas who have not been able to come and see my newborn baby so I understand the sadness of it)."
2021-05-19 22:36,"My advice to journalists is go beyond the anecdotes of Australians who remain overseas (35,000 and dropping each week), or just those who want to visit family overseas and object to the maintenance of tight pandemic-related international travel restrictions. The Australian (partial) border closure has indisputably worked as a very solid first line of defence, and very few of us will give up that success lightly! 

Keeping an highly infectious virus out of a community works better than trying control it within. Australia (and NZ) has largely avoided the economic and socially damaging lockdowns of other countries due to a) a voluntary national response of citizens between March - May last year, itself made possible by b) financial payments so people could bunker down over those 3 months. 

Importantly, the success of these temporary actions were reinforced by c) constraints on international travel (inbound and outbound) so that the virus wasn't constantly reseeding across communities.

The Melbourne (population 5 million) example from last winter shows how extreme the response needs to be when the virus sets seed across a city (75% of all Australian Covid-19 cases, and nearly all deaths were in Victoria during that period).

So yes, international border full reopenings should be linked to broad scale vaccination, but to get there our spluttering vaccine program and too heavy reliance on AZ needs to change. 

Until then we'll broadly support international travel constraints."
2021-05-19 22:38,"As an American Aussie I'm sad that I have had to suspend my extravgant globe trotting and privilege, but quite happy with the way Australia has handled the pandemic overall. I agree with those that say when you change country, you have to accept certain realities. My grandparents came over to the USA from Italy when they were children and never went back, as an example, for a variety of reasons: poverty, war, disease. We really are no different, except that now we have hundreds of airlines to thank for spreading the virus globally in weeks. Are we really that needy that we want to risk death, again, in a rush back into the skies? There should be less hand wringing and obsessive focus on vaccines and side effects. In Australia, we need to focus on how to quickly get that done and deal with quarantine. My next Astra Zeneca vaccine is in two weeks."
2021-05-19 22:43,"There is a clear overriding political reason for the (Liberal-National party) Australian Government's tough stance which should be expanded upon.

The State of Western Australia (Labor government) has also maintained a similar strict border policy, even barring non-West Australians' from entering the State at times.  The normally conservative electorate loved it, and the Liberal-National party was almost wiped out in the recent State election - the Prime Minister's conservative Liberal party now only has 2 members in the WA Legislative Assembly (house of representatives).

PM Morrison is hoping that he can achieve a similar result Federally (but instead decimating the Federal Labor Party), so unfortunately there is no chance that he will relax our border controls any time soon.

And unfortunately he will probably get re-elected for adopting this stance."
2021-05-19 22:53,"The author of this article may not realise that Western Australia had a state election during this pandemic period where the incumbent government essentially wiped out the conservative opposition based on the handling of the pandemic. Such measures involved restricting travel within the state, lockdowns to prevent community transmission, making demands on the federal government to limit travel from India during their latest outbreak.
The vast majority of Western Australians support the closure of borders until vaccine rates improve, it is a small price to pay to live without the virus."
2021-05-19 22:59,"I am and expat yank who has lived in the land of OZ for 28 years.  Our government has done an outstanding job protecting us from the coronavirus.  I am happy to compare Aussie coronavirus deaths to that of Trump's America.  

However, our government has done a poor job in rolling out the vaccination compared to Biden's America.  Relying on one vaccination, Astra Zeneca, with issues around blood clots and questionable efficacy against variants has resulted in a slow rollout.  I will wait for when Pfizer is available to over 50's.  

No doubt the Aussie government could act in a more humane manner and create more quarantine facilities perhaps in rural regions to safely repatriate citizens.  But overall Aussies are happy to be COVID free even if some sacrifices are made.  Looking forward to traveling again when it is safe to do so."

2021-05-19 22:45,"This is such typical reporting on Australia by the NYT. You briefly mention in passing that over three quarters of Australians support the border closures, then spend the rest of the article telling us heartbreaking stories of an Australian solicitor who's been living in London for almost a decade and a linguistics professor who couldn't go to a prestigious German university for a year. To top it off you quote Tim Soutphommasane, who has leeched off the Australian taxpayer for decades on a six figure salary doing nothing other than regularly accuse us of racism.

Guess what, most Australians aren't globe-trotting lawyers, professors and consultants. We're ordinary people who look at the state of the rest of the world and thank God for how lucky we are to be safe and healthy. At least 580,000 Americans are dead, and I haven't even met a single person who knows someone who had COVID."

2021-05-19 21:51,"The Morrison government bet heavily on the AstraZeneca vaccine. Now with its blood clot problems, the government is trying to palm it off on over 50s. Those under 50 are given the Pfizer vaccine. Is there any wonder that vaccine hesitancy is growing in Australia?"
2021-05-19 22:39,"Oh what a miserable place to be shut into during a pandemic! Let’s see. Huge expanses of country side, near endless sunshine, beautiful coast and beaches, large cosmopolitan cities. Virtually covid free. An internationally connected service driven economy, great internet, free medical system. A rich country that everyone wants to live in, whose inhabitants love to travel and until a year ago - did - a lot. Now some of us are stuck. A mostly rich and privileged society’s problem. Another year with restrictions? I think I’ll escape to somewhere less safe!"
2021-05-19 22:47,"This all boils down to our useless government unable to facilitate a vaccination program efficiently. We cannot open our borders while the majority of the population is unvaccinated. The comments in this article regarding those not wanting to be vaccinated are untrue. The majority of the adult population is actually ineligible for the vaccine at this time. We cannot get vaccinated even if we choose to do so. As a woman in my 30s, I have to wait until the government says I can.
Most Australians want our border opened, we want our citizens abroad to be able to come home, but until the government gets us vaccinated, it's not a risk we want to take."
2021-05-19 22:00,"Not taking away from the success of quashing the virus and achieving zero COVID (which was largely a result of decisive action by the state governments, not the federal one!), the lack of forward-looking perspective how to get out of this mess is absolutely appalling and shows the federal government’s unwillingness for progress. Everything is reactive - no vision, no action, lying low to not be taken to account for anything. 

I hope the mood in the population about border closures will change. Of course we should not simply open “no matter what”, but there needs to be a pathway and targets that will in turn drive people to take up the vaccine, which is available in abundance now. It’s an utter mess as it is.

Having family in Europe planning to visit us, everyone over there is now vaccinated with at least the first shot, one is in disbelief when learning about the mid-2022 border closures."
2021-05-19 21:53,"Scott Morrison's refusal to 'risk' re-opening is due to his government's dual failures: first, the vaccine roll out, and second the failure, 12 months later, to build additional quarantine accommodation to enable increased number of arrivals (it's not like there's a lack of space).

Unfortunately his policy appeals to that worst quality of Australians - insularity and xenophobia.  Yes, we love our mates.  But we also like living in our little bubble and for things to be safe and nice. The comments here echo this.  We are all thankful we have escaped the worst.  But the idea that we will have no further deaths, no further breakouts (even if minor) is just a fantasy, and we need to prepare for that.  

The family reunion stories are heartbreaking and I have a number of friends in UK who have had parents die out here over the last year.  

But what about business? Why can't I hire a suitably qualified person and bring them in from another country provided they are vaccinated and quarantine?  Restaurants, law firms, farms, consulting businesses are all desperate for staff and workers. Migration lawyers I know tell me this is an impossibility and will be until 2022.  How can there not be a plan for that?  

This is what happens when the marketers and school teachers run the country.  We won't see the damage to our economy and place in the world until it's too late."
2021-05-19 21:47,"75 percent of Australians support the government position of keeping our borders closed until at least mid 2022. No politician can ignore that. 

We are simply taking advantage of our status as an island nation to keep our population safe from a global pandemic. Yes, there are economic and personal costs. But the benefits far outweigh them. If others wish to sneer at us as a “Shangri La” then let them."
2021-05-19 22:19,"At 73, though a dual citizen, I do not need to travel to Australia, as now, my children and grandchildren live in North America, including Mexico.  Those living in Mexico City became disgusted with the response of their leader, Obrador, and came here for vaccinations. At present vaccinations are in plentiful supply due to the silly hesitancy of conservatives, so no questions are being asked and vaccines are happily given. As a result of a well vaccinated population in most nursing homes deaths, are dropping precipitously and even unvaccinated residents appear free of Covid. Now most stores are making mask wearing optional.  It seems nuts to this expatriate that Australians are not vaccinated! You could easily accomplish this! Problem solved. I suspect that Morrison's Evangelical misgivings might be putting him firmly, if secretively, in the vaccine hesitancy camp. Evangelicals cite the use of stem cells in research as reason to refuse the vaccine. Franklin Graham is coming out and trying to convince the flock it is important to get the vaccine.  It is unnecessary for relatives to be kept apart and for businesses to be denied tourists. Now Europe is open the US travelers!"
2021-05-19 22:42,"Australia issued costly one year work visas to ""back packers"", young people from across the world,  who arrived late 2019 and early 2020, only to have to return to their home countries as the borders were closing with their plans canceled.

2021-05-19 23:26,"I'm an American expat who has lived in Melbourne since 1997.  I left the US years ago because it was clear to me that America was going in a direction I didn't want to go as a human being.  Which culminated in the US dropping down the rabbit hole and having the grotesque, buffoonish, malevolent presidency of Donald Trump.

Covid-19 humbled the world and all the governments as none of them were prepared for this deadly world wide pandemic.  Every country struggled with how to deal with it and obviously Australia has handled it far better than most.  If Trump had handled it with a modicum of competency instead undermining Fauci the US could've done the same.

What's impressive to me is that the center right ""Liberal"" party went again all it's ideological tenets and put in huge income supports which let all the states shutdown without Aussies having to worry about their jobs.  They were projecting a budget surplus of $5 billion and now have $160 billion of debt.  Aussies were spared the darwinian choice of choosing either their lives or livelihoods which Americans were to forced to do last year when their support ran out last July.

Every world government has made some mistakes in handling Covid-19--including the Morrison and state governments, but the Aussies always corrected them.  They'll fix it.

I'm no fan of the Morrison government but I always laugh when my labor party friends tell me it's mean.  I tell them they don't know mean until they've seen Republicans at work."
2021-05-19 23:40,"""Hermit nation"". What a joke.
Australia is not a small country like Austria or Czech Republic - or North Korea. It is an entire continent slightly larger than the contiguous United States in land area!
It's not like people can't find new places to travel to if they look. They could be lounging on tropical beaches in Queensland one week and they fly down to the snow fields in NSW and Victoria in a matter of hours for skiing.
No, the complaints are coming from the Usual Suspects in industry who want to put $$$ and the economy before health. They still don't comprehend that a healthy economy and a healthy population are interlocked."

With lethal and more transmittable variants of still rampant and spreading on every continent, is it really that important to come home to visit grandma?  Violation of quarantine requirements has been widespread in many places.  It would take just one infected but asymptomatic person to create a disaster.  Oh, and to the economic fallout, the sky hasn't fallen in yet.  If anyone wants to see and alternative to PM Morrison's policy, take a trip to the United States instead."
2021-05-19 23:40,"The Federal government has failed in setting up proper quarantine facilities and in getting sufficient vaccine supplies (especially Pfizer) and in the vaccine roll-out. However, I fully support the border closure. No one wants deaths and more lockdowns. Australians can see the tragedy unfolding in India and elsewhere and we feel lucky that we have crushed the virus and can pretty much live a normal life. Of course, there are costs, especially to the tertiary sector which has become over-reliant on international students and that has caused my academic career to stall.

But, to all these people who say if the government doesn’t reopen the borders when I want them to, I’m going to leave Australia, I say please do. I would love your academic job and there are millions more like me in Australia and overseas. Australia will not lose out long term by this.  When our borders re-open there will be far more coming in than going out. In fact, it has been nice to have a break from constant high levels of immigration and overcrowding. 

Perhaps those who are desperate to leave long-term should be able to do so provided they are vaccinated and agree not to come back until borders open. Of course, plenty of people sign things under false pretences or change their minds later, especially when they see the horrors elsewhere and then blame other people for their choices."

Most Australians are eager to be vaccinated and open the borders.  Now, while vaccinations are being hoarded by the US and EU, Australia is waiting patiently for more vaccines to become available once the more troubled nations have had first go.  How curious that this should become a case for lambasting one of the few countries that actually kept it together during the pandemic."

But the closed borders meant that I couldn’t be there for my Mom in her final hours, which would have meant the world to me. And neither am I now allowed to look after her estate in Germany. This is a huge emotional burden for me. 
I despair at the hardline stance of the Government in this matter! It is in violation of the basic human right for a person to be allowed to leave a country. It reminds me of the unpleasant times people experienced in East Germany. I would have never thought that I would find myself caught up in a similar situation. Nightmare stuff."

That's pretty effective! Those 9400 had such low amounts of the virus that it was even more rare to be transmittable to others. And ones who were positive had greatly reduced risk of severe reaction or death. These vaccines are showing to be highly effective. These type of statistics need to be shown to the world and pushed to help the vaccine rollout everywhere."
2021-05-17 17:49,"This is creative and smart leadership! I'm impressed. I also suspect the size of the school facilitated faster pivoting when circumstances changed? State university behemoths with budgets locked in have a bigger burden in becoming this flexible as they wade through bureaucracy to implement changes - while theoretically having bigger pockets, albeit inaccessible pockets, to implement such changes. How did this school generate the funding to enact all this? It might be a lesson to other institutions in how to effectively respond to change quickly and efficiently?"
2021-05-17 17:57,"Thank you for this thoughtful article.  Testing, tracking and enforcing quarantine etc. are essential tools that have already been adopted successfully by South Korea, Taiwan, China, Singapore, Australia, New Zealand, etc. etc.  A great nation like the U.S. should have the capacity to anticipate and prevent the grave risk such as this pandemic.  But it simply did not happen, and the disastrous failure of Spanish Flue repeated here and beyond.  Those who can not learn from history are doomed to repeat the past mistakes."
2021-05-17 18:10,I work at a college in food service. Up until late January did the campus require testing of food service workers. Prior to that from last August until late January we went on the honor system. Answer 3 questions relating to covid. Then sign off on them. No temperature checks . No universal app sign in like the rest of the campus was required to do on a daily basis. I feel like the college administration put me and all of my coworkers at risk by allowing my company to waive that protocol.
2021-05-17 18:11,"Detection of COVID virus levels  in wastewater seems a promising tool for surveillance of active COVID cases within a city, when the worst of the pandemic is behind us.

2021-05-17 19:41,"This is a thoroughly reported story about what seems like an outstanding program put together by a lot of smart people building on each other’s strengths.  One issue that was not addressed is privacy. The program collected huge amounts of personal data. Did all students voluntarily opt in to all parts involving their identifying information? Did they have a choice? Is there a policy in place governing how long that data will be kept and what will be done with it? How would the university respond if coronavirus data inadvertently points to possible illegal activity (for example, transmission patterns that turn out to be related to promiscuous behavior pointing to prostitution by a student or a member of the wider community)?"

2021-05-17 23:34,"Such a well written article. Thank you. My son is a CMU student - started in August 2020. I knew that the school was way above average on their Covid handling. They were in contact with all parents and students starting in early April 2020 and they had weekly or biweekly online meetings with the university president and their Covid team communicating thoroughly the work that they were doing to keep our children safe. They were fluid in their ability to react to new requirements and changes in their numbers of Covid cases on campus. They had an offsite hotel set up with food delivery for positive cases that never got very high. I have another child at a different, much larger university in Colorado and they didn’t do 1/10 of the planning and communicating that CMU did. As a scientist, I was super impressed. Especially when they rolled out the dormitory waste water testing early in the pandemic. And our son was able to enjoy mostly in-classroom participation."
2021-05-18 0:34,"Great article. I lived in Grand Junction during the time referenced in the article and CMU really did take the lead in offering testing for the community at large while the county testing lacked adequate resources. CMU also set a good example to focus on the science instead of the politics, even though there are still plenty of Trump supporters in GJ. St.Mary’s Hospital in GJ treated/treats some of the worst Covid cases in that region of Colorado (especially critical patients flown in from smaller mountain towns) since it’s the largest facility between Denver and Salt Lake. The community and CMU rallied around the health care workers at St Mary’s during the pandemic. CMU is an important part of GJ’s collective identity and its future. With recent population growth and an improving employer base I hope more of these students opt to stay in GJ or in the nearby region after they graduate."
2021-05-18 1:16,"looks like the universities generally did a great job of doing what we all new was the right thing: test, track, advise.

2021-05-18 2:23,"Anticipating Events, quick thinking, decentralizing, intelligent allocation of resources, real-time data applied to sensible robust software - all of these combined to get COVID under control in arguably one of the densest populated city in the world: Mumbai under the direction of an able Municipal commissioner Iqbal Singh Chahal. A good heart coupled with a good mind & good direction & people will rise up to the occasion under the most trying of circumstances as did a group of Doctors who advised him & others who chose to forgo their (higher) fees for the common good. Many of the best pay for play hospitals whose doors were closed for the common people were thrown open through skillful presentation of dire scenarios (not low probability at all) which would likely deter their usual rich clientele from abroad & ruin their business for good, along with an appeal for working for the common good & many beds which would have laid unused even as people were dying - got released to the general population.

All of this places the focus on what many others with ample power to do good in India are really doing? It looks like it is for lack of resources but that likely is just a minor issue. The issues are more social than anything else. It starts with basic respect for the people of the country & ""treating others with the same concern & diligence as one would have others treat them or their people"".

I used to think the CDC was a pretty sophisticated organization.  Then late 2019/early 2020, Dr. Helen Chu of Washington state, who while working on a flu project, stumbled upon coronavirus cases and sounded the alarm.

Besides all you see in this article they kept students and parents informed all the time. There were constant “town hall” meetings with the experts and the public. They did a survey before the fall term asking what the students wanted to do...in-person or remote.  It was an overwhelming response of they wanted in-person. So the school said okay, then these are the things we have to do to make it happen.  If people were not comfortable with that then you could opt to do remote.  They held tuition prices and even rolled some back if you were remote. My son is the only student I know who was 100% in-person this semester. And what a great semester he had!

Here's my take - for those who considered the mask an infringement  on their personal autonomy, even if they agreed with the need for it and blamed the virus for the imposition, the persistence of it reminds them of their own lack of control and their mortality."
2021-05-17 10:30,"I'm sorry but I find this deeply depressing. I'm passionately left wing, but this has become about identity politics, not science. I've seen many people on social media writing that they'll continue wearing masks so as to not be mistaken for Republicans."

So, I will continue to wear mine when ever I feel it necessary. I am fully vaxxed btw.  And being retired, I do not consider it any kind of imposition to wear a mask on the occasions I do go out."

2021-05-17 10:38,"First, wearing a mask doesn’t hurt anyone else, and can only benefit all parties, since there is still a significant portion of the population that refuses to be vaccinated. How curious that it is the ‘freedom-loving’ folks who are most bothered by whether other Americans freely *choose* to wear masks ? How is it their business ?

Second, the J & J vaccine is less effective against infections; the Yankees had quite a number testing positive.  Although few showed symptoms, it makes one wonder whether infected vaccinated people really can’t infect others, or whether this was due to the handful of unvaccinated members of the team. Either way, for those of us with immune system problems, the fewer infections the better - as long as there are cases out there, I will keep wearing my mask.

Finally, during the flu season, masks (and working from home) effectively eliminated just about cases.  For the first time in years, I was free of the misery I experienced in Jan-March (despite having had flu shots which only protected me thru Dec).  So even without Covid, I plan on mask-wearing during the period I am most vulnerable to the flu."

I am vaccinated but I don't have any plans to stop wearing my mask when I'm out shopping for now at least.  I am going to ask my Dr. next time I see him if I can get a test to confirm that the vaccine worked for me, as for some people on some types of immunotherapy, it doesn't.  

I REALLY hate what this has become in America.  It's actually all the anti-maskers and anti-vacciners that I'm afraid of.   They only see it as a risk to themselves, and don't seem to consider the larger picture and that others may have higher risks than themselves."
2021-05-17 10:40,"I've had the virus.  I've been vaccinated.  I'm in contact with people who are confirmed to have the virus every day.

For over a year, I have avoided all unnecessary trips, eating out, etc., so as to minimize my chance of infecting others.

I've never worn a mask outdoors, except when working with the Ag Department on my property (they're required to wear them, and I don't want to be rude), but I wear one inside of shops because NYS requires it.

As soon as NYS stops requiring masks inside of businesses, I will stop wearing one.  Until that happens I will wear one.  It doesn't hurt me any, and if we all followed the rules, and got our vaccines as recommended, this whole mess would be over much sooner."
2021-05-17 10:41,"I have no issue at all with other people wearing masks. As far as I'm concerned, they can do whatever they want. I will, however, start to get frustrated if after the next few months of declining cases and rising vaccine numbers I am still mandated to wear a mask either at college next year or various inside businesses despite being fully vaccinated. The science is pretty clear (apparently), that fully vaccinated people do not experience death or severe covid on scales that matter, do not readily pass it to others, and are reasonably resistant to variants. If things continue to trend the way they are now, why should the burden be placed on me any longer?"
2021-05-17 10:41,"Even though I am vaccinated, I continue to wear a mask on my daily mobility scooter rides through the neighborhood. As a 79 year-old woman who lives with an advanced case of MS and has an unvaccinated caregiver who helps me stay at home rather than going into a nursing home, I cannot take any chances of testing positive with even a mild case of COVID-19. I also live in Wayne County, Michigan which continues to be at “extremely high risk“ from the virus.

Since March 2020 I have been super cautious about protecting myself and my 91-year-old husband from getting infected with the virus. I am not going to let up on that now."
2021-05-17 10:41,"Pre-Covid, I wanted to wear a mask whenever I was on a plane or using public transport, simply to reduce the risk of catching the flu or a bothersome cold, but I was aware that it would make me look weird because mask-wearing was not really an accepted thing in the West. I am glad mask-wearing has now become ubiquitous. I intend to continue wearing mine in certain situations - not just for my own protection, but out of consideration for others. I find it ridiculous that it should be an act that creates discord or scorn, and frankly I don't care."
2021-05-17 10:43,"This is the modern day version of the scarlet letter. So, if people choose to wear a mask now vaccinated or not. They are now scorned. Again it's personal choice. I believe the CDC should've not relaxed the mask mandate until the virus numbers are below a safe number. By them doing so it now creates animosity amongst each other. Mask wearing has worked from the beginning and will continue to work . I will continue to wear mine regardless. It has kept me safe and virus free ."
2021-05-17 10:43,I plan to wear a mask for some months to come even though my husband and I are fully vaccinated and are waiting for appointments to vaccinate our teens. It should be a matter of choice whether we take off or keep wearing our masks outdoors or indoors. Wearing masks harms nobody. Not wearing masks is a proven way for the virus to spread rapidly in closed spaces. President Biden continues to wear his mask outdoors. So that is the final word for me.
2021-05-17 10:44,"Even at this point, I still have encounters that clearly indicate that some people simply do not understand infection. There seem to be lots of people who still think that mask-wearing is all about personal protection, period. They just don't get it that masks also protect everyone else if the wearer has contracted anything (whether or not they would care if they understood is another question). I have also been told about some people's ""miracle bubble"" that supposedly somehow magically protects their entire family so that none of them are going to get vaccinated. Faced with this kind of magical thinking and ignorance, I'm planning to keep wearing a mask for quite some time, and wouldn't be surprised if there's a resurgence of C19 cases in the fall."
2021-05-17 10:45,"Over the weekend, I saw plenty of people here in NYC out on the streets and in the parks without masks, and plenty wearing masks. In typical New York style, nobody was getting bent out of shape over another person's choice in this matter. We have the official word that it's OK to take off our masks if we're fully vaccinated, yet a lot of people still haven't had the vaccine, and the virus is still out there, so it seems that reasonable people could be responsibly making either choice in this matter. Before vaccinations, it was prudent and respectful to wear masks everywhere, and in NYC the overwhelming majority of us did all the time. Now that we can take our masks off...or leave them on, it's nobody else's business which we choose."
2021-05-17 10:48,"Continuing to wear a mask is really no different than wearing a jacket on what many consider a “warm” day. Most feel comfortable to go without, but some have a personal preference to don an extra layer. It makes no sense to express ire or outward disdain toward those who choose attire that suits their own preference, and speaks to the broad intolerance we’ve developed as a society."
2021-05-17 10:49,"I am fully vaccinated, but I will wear a mask whenever my child needs to wear one, since he is not vaccinated."
2021-05-17 10:49,"This ""backlash"" against wearing masks is something that teacher unions should have their radar up for this summer.  

Many school administrations will be under pressure due to the loud, vocal minority of anti-mask parents to ""return to normal"" by not only removing the mask mandate, but going the additional step of prohibiting mask wearing among those who want to continue wearing them.

This fight is coming."
2021-05-17 10:51,"First off, be patient with people. We’ve been through a lot and it’s going to take some folks a while to let their guard down.

Second, it’s one thing to freak out if someone wasn’t wearing a mask back when things were out of control because they were exposing other people to risk.  Someone who continues to wear a mask might be a little too anxious, but they ain’t hurting anybody.

Third, I think even if you’re vaccinated, you should wear a mask indoors if your around unvaccinated people or a public place at least until we reach herd immunity. You don’t know when the next variant will hit until it does.

Fourth, if I’m ever sick during flu season again, I’m wearing a mask. It’s a small, easy thing to do to keep others from getting sick."
2021-05-17 10:53,"Having had an office in Chinatown for several years, I was used to mask-wearing long before covid came along. Seeing my AAPI neighbors and office mates wearing a mask was a good lesson and from that time I always saw it for what it was, a sign of respect for the people around you. I got in the habit of wearing a mask during cold and flu season or when I was sick, but I also noticed that I was hardly ever sick, I went from having two or three bad colds a season to having one mild one that lasted a couple of days at most. I see no reason to stop wearing one now in indoor or crowded situations, and my immunocompromised husband is going to continue wearing a mask. We are both fully vaxxed and so are our elderly parents. But why take that kind of risk when you can protect yourself with a minimum of fuss?"
2021-05-17 10:55,"As an essential worker I double masked with a N95 and a surgical from the beginning. I cut the bands off the N95 for comfort and let the ear loop mask hold it in place. 

About a month ago I went to a single surgical mask after my wife got her first Pfizer shot and the virus waning. She got fully vaccinated on Saturday joining myself and our two kids. 

I’ll decide in 2 weeks after my wife gains full immunity about masking outdoors however indoors without a mask is not an option for the foreseeable future."
2021-05-17 10:57,First the first time ever I have gone 14 months without so much as a sniffle. I am a college professor and I normally come down with at least one cold per semester. Sometimes it turns into bronchitis. I will probably continue to mask up indoors in crowds for a long time.
2021-05-17 10:58,"Thankfully, I am fully vaccinated and at a place in life that I don’t care if people stare at me for wearing a mask. They can even make under-breath comments that I ignore. Most of these people have subverted the very meaning of the word freedom and have cheapened the American flag by their use of it. My health is all about me - not them."
2021-05-17 11:00,"“Kindergartners, while adorable, are quick to share their secretions,” 

Father of 5 year old twins and they have attended school fully masked the entire year.  This is the first year in three years of daycare/pre-school that they have not been sick and consequently, I have not been sick also.  If I was an early elementary teacher, I would mandate masks from around November through March."
2021-05-17 11:01,"I'm 67, fully vaccinated, and have no respiratory issues, but I'm wearing my mask and will continue to do so.  It's a small thing, but if it makes others feel safer (it certainly makes me feel safer), then what is the harm?    

Since it is not a wise move to inquire if an unmasked person has been vaccinated, wearing a mask assures others that I am not a threat to their health, and makes me more comfortable around others who are unmasked.  

With the record low number of flu cases this fall and winter, why would anyone question the efficacy of masks?"
2021-05-17 11:04,I believe that the CDC moved too fast here. My governor ended the mask mandate the day after the announcement. But I work with the public and everyone seems to be wearing one still. At the grocery store every person had one on. To be honest I’m surprised because I live in a very Red area. It’s going to be hard to adjust to feel comfortable not wearing a mask for a lot of people including myself. I just hope this loosening doesn’t lead to another rise in cases.
2021-05-17 11:05,"I'm fully vaccinated, but still wear a mask in public.

We still have a local mask mandate, and Ohio's mask mandate doesn't lift until June 2.  The people who enforce these mask mandates are, generally speaking, low-wage front-line workers whose job is already hard enough.  They don't have ESP and don't know which of the unmasked people passing by are fully vaccinated.  Even though I'm fully vaccinated, I still wear a mask in stores and other indoor public spaces to make their lives easier, rather than become that jerk who argues with the clerk or greeter who is tasked with enforcing a policy that he or she did not set and has no control over."
2021-05-17 11:06,"We should all be free to wear whatever protection we choose.  

Most of us also have the ability to choose the nature of our social interactions.

What we should not be doing is projecting some political or social view upon those making a different choice.

I won't judge you for wearing a mask.  

I respectfully ask that you not judge my choice to go without as a fully vaccinated person.  

You won't know my politics or religion just by seeing my face in public.  

Don't assume you can."
2021-05-17 11:09,"People in Asia started wearing masks after the 1918 flu pandemic, so it’s not illogical for people to start wearing masks now when they’re sick, or fearful of becoming ill. 

As someone who gets long lasting and severe upper respiratory infections, if there’s a simple thing I can do to avoid them at the height of the season, I will.

I travel extensively around the world, and have been wearing masks on planes for years. It just makes sense. And if a foreign capital is polluted, I’ll wear a mask there to. As will many people there.

It’s not about politics, it’s a pretty common sense health precaution.￼￼"
2021-05-17 11:09,"Free at last... Eight weeks out from full vaccination and thrilled to remove my mask in most ""safe"" situations EXCEPT now I may not be able to. What a joke!

Retailers, including grocers such as Trader Joe's, which will allow maskless shopping for the vaccinated, ensure I will need to keep mine on if I buy there.

Those who are not vaccinated will, no doubt, freely mix among shoppers and I do not plan to be near them. Most of the unvaccinated also rebeled on masks.

Vaccines are good but the cases of infection after vaccination, from Bill Maher, to some Yankees members, are new proof that they are penetrable.

Some will say ""Oh, but you'd get a mild case."" Well, I don't want ANY case.

We should have vaccination passports.

Bottom line: Those who are unvaccinated because they chose not to be can free range, while those who care about health will still be constrained. 

Grown-ups continue to be responsible while the petulant will continue to balk."
2021-05-17 11:10,"Anyone who hasn’t been traumatized in one shape or form by the events of the past year is kidding themselves. My wife and I decided to go the Tyson’s Corner Mall this weekend. We walked into Zara and there was over 100 people in the store. Even though we’re both fully vaxed, and everyone else as masked we couldn’t take the anxiety. We left. Now I suppose I understand what agoraphobia feels like."
2021-05-17 11:11,"If people continue to wear a mask in public, especially in a crowded space, that means they are cautious and still want to protect themselves and others. To those who are anti vaccination and anti masks, I say please keep protecting yourself and others. 
The roles are going to be reversed now, those of us who will keep our masks in the grocery store will get the ire of the maskless but at least I know I follow my conscience."
2021-05-17 11:12,I will never get on an airplane again without a mask.  Prior to covid I always got sick after a flight.  Going to a crowded restaurant - no thanks.  I guess I am no fun anymore- totally cool with that.
2021-05-17 11:13,"The CDC is not releasing data about the performance of the Johnson and Johnson vaccine against the variants.  

Nine million people got the Johnson and Johnson at the urging of the government ('take the first shot available' 'get a shot in your arm'.)

The 60-70 percent effectiveness of the J&J was supposed to be okay (for those of us who got it) if we were careful with masks or if the country reached heard immunity.  

The CDC has changed tactics out of necessity because so many people refused vaccines. 
'the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines are 95% effective against the original and the variants.  This news is so wonderful.  Vaccinated people are completely protected. Those who want to be completely protected can get the vaccines.'

Towards the bottom: 'The J&J vaccine is less effective and we have no information about its performance against variants.'

The CDC will not release (from now on) complete information about breakthroughs, so as this experiment progresses, we won't have new information.  

There will be huge pressure on me to go maskless at work.    It's concerning."
2021-05-17 11:14,"The CDC's mask guidelines are reckless given that the majority of the population remain unvaccinated and that there is no plan in place to delineate between the vaccinated and non vaccinated.

I am fully vaccinated and do not feel safe in public without a mask.
The reasons are many, but here are a few for the sake of expediency.
1-The vaccine comes with a disclaimer that ""it may offer protection"".
2-Length of protection at 3-6 months.
3-Variants are on the prowl.
4-""Warp Speed"" by definition hinders confidence.
5-Vaccine may protect recipient but recipient may still transmit.
6-And, finally, wearing a mask is just the respectable thing to do in deference to others, be they vaccinated or not.

When safety bows its humble head to economics, run as fast as you can. 

This has been a long time coming. It is political despite party, and favors ""getting back to normal"" (what ever that means) over everything else. 

So, burn your old masks and buy a new, improved model, for this hiccup promises to avenge itself whence the 3-6 month prophylactic runs its course."
2021-05-17 11:14,"Masks help with season allergies, too, so if you see somebody masked outside, don’t assume they are over-cautious.  I ahve all these nice masks now, I’ll wear one when it suits me."
2021-05-17 10:48,My wife & I are fully vaccinated with the Moderna product and have no objections to continuing to wear face masks when out & about. We always think of those women (primarily Muslims of course) of our neighbouring province of Quebec who BY LAW are forbidden to cover their faces if they are employed by that province!!
2021-05-17 10:28,"No one has the right to tell me that I can't wear a mask, any more than they have the right to tell  me that I should be wearing a shirt of a different color.  It isn't hurting them, so it's none of their business.  I don't intend to be pushed around by bullies."
2021-05-17 10:46,"I've had my vaccinations, am healthy, and not concerned at all that I might contract Covid.

On the other hand, if I can make another person feel safer, why wouldn't I want to do that?"
2021-05-17 10:29,Everyone still wears masks in Maryland. We’ve gotten used to them and Covid is not over yet.
2021-05-17 11:13,"In a country where you have such a large movement trying to allow legal gun carry everywhere, which I believe to be kind of perverse, nobody but nobody should say anything if someone wants to wear a mask. Just apply the same arguments. It’s none of anybody’s business."
2021-05-17 11:13,"I’ve endured too much death and sickness, our staff is still exhausted and stressed. The numbers are down but we still have people in our small hospital dying of this virus.  I continually ask myself why the unvaccinated come to my hospital to ask for help from an infectious disease they don’t believe exists. If you can’t breath and don’t believe in vaccines turn on Fox News in the comfort of your home."
2021-05-17 10:30,"I’ll wear a mask indoors, thank you very much.
If you don’t like it, don’t look."
2021-05-17 10:58,A map of states that enforced mask mandates corresponds closely with how people in those states voted for president. <-- doesn't read correctly...
2021-05-17 10:28,My family will continue to wear masks for some indefinite period.  But we wonder: is it anything new for Dan Rather to be confused?  Isn't he the one who walked off his job while on air?
2021-05-17 11:15,This is the first year of my life where I haven't had any sort of illness.  That's due to relative isolation and masking in public.  Not sure why I'd want to give that up when life gets back to normal.
2021-05-17 10:32,"I'm 71 and vaccinated. But I plan to continue masking. Statistically, 2 out of every 3 Americans is still NOT vaccinated. Further, we know that over 50% of all Covid infections are totally asymptomatic. Then we have the ""Indian variant"" Covid that could invade at any time. 
And to expect un-vaccinated people to be honest about whether they are vaccinated is just totally laughable—people lie all the time for their own benefit. I don't feel safe playing roulette with my health. I think the CDC is totally wrong on the mask issue."
2021-05-17 11:17,"We are all suffering from PTSD to one degree or another, as COVID continues to wane. It's understandable that human behavior will reflect the full spectrum of risk-aversion. The CDC's sudden reversal of its mask policy -- without adequate coordination with state and municipal governments -- didn't help matters. 

Even those fully vaccinated people convinced by the science that they are ""safe"" (like me) will take time to unmask, and will continue to model behavior in crowded setting and during flu season. Let's be patient with the most gun-shy among us."
2021-05-17 11:18,There are a variety of reasons why fully vaccinated people may want to continue to wear a mask.I've discovered wearing a mask when I walk out of doors has helped my seasonal allergies. I expect to continue wearing a mask during pollen season.
2021-05-17 11:18,A number of people will be in masks for medical reasons much longer. Numerous transplant patients taking immune suppression therapy are not finding antibodies being developed post vaccine.  Fortunately for me I am awaiting transplant so have had the vaccine before the surgery.
2021-05-17 11:21,"Difference is, people who wear a mask even though they don't have to aren't hurting anybody.  Those who go unmasked when they should not cannot say the same."
2021-05-17 11:22,"The head of the CDC has said that the fully vaccinated are protected against severe disease and therefore don't need to wear masks.  However, even mild disease can lead to  substantial numbers of ""long haulers.""  Moderate disease is defined as pulse ox less than 94 and some lung involvement, i.e. Pneumonia.  19 fully vaccinated people  ( Pfizer or Moderna) working in the Singapore airport came down with ""break through"" Covid, most likely due to the Indian variant which is now also in the US.  Good reasons to continue wearing a mask especially indoors.  What was the rush? Why not wait a few more months to see how variants spread here and to get closer to herd immunity?"
2021-05-17 11:24,"The main reason I keep a mask with me is because I know good and well the neighbors in my building never wore one through the whole pandemic. 

The mask gets slid off my face when I have 6 feet of space or I’m on my board moving fast outside. If I don’t have that space around people walking through the city or indoors the masks goes back on. 

It’ll be a conditional thing for me even though I’ve been vaccinated for well over a month. I’m in my mid 20s and even though there have been people younger than me to die from it I figure the vaccine, being in shape, and putting the mask on whenever I’m in a crowd should be sufficient to live my life as I normally would. 

I’m not gonna keep this thing on my face through the summer if nobody is around though. I understand it’s a century old courtesy in parts of the Eastern Hemisphere but I just don’t see them being as ubiquitous here even if millions of people keep them on after the virus passes"
2021-05-17 11:25,"I am a kidney transplant recipient who is fully vaccinated. However, after the Johns Hopkins study was published, finding poor vaccine response in immune-suppressed people, my transplant team sent me for the covid-19 spike protein antibody test which specifically measures antibody response to the vaccine (different than the antibody test for covid infection). Despite being fully vaccinated, the test showed that I have no antibodies whatsoever. I will continue to mask and social distance in all situations for the forseeable future."
2021-05-17 11:26,"Last year, my seasonal pollen allergy symptoms were greatly reduced resulting in the least debilitating reactions I have had in decades.  I found myself using far less nasal spray and other allergy medications than usual.  

The Times noted the effect of masks earlier this year.
<a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/31/well/live/mask-allergy-symptoms.html"" target=""_blank"">https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/31/well/live/mask-allergy-symptoms.html</a>

Will I wear a mask outdoors to prevent catching or spreading a deadly virus like Covid-19?  You bet I will.

Will I wear one outdoors for a significant reduction but not complete elimination of allergy symptoms that annoy me and disrupt my life, but pose no lethal threat?  Probably not, but it's an option now available."
2021-05-17 11:26,"Germs are germs. And masks help to mitigate risk of getting sick. If nothing else, we've proven that over the past year. So I am not in a great hurry to get rid of the mask in crowded indoor and outdoor settings. However I believe it will be perceived as a political identifier. And I think some people like that."
2021-05-17 11:27,"I have health issues. Although they are greatly controlled by a strict diet, I can’t get rid of the underlying issues. I will keep wearing a mask to protect myself."
2021-05-17 11:28,"It's been a while since I lived in NYC, but taking the subway two times daily during rush hour, with people crammed in and breathing all over each other? If I still was doing that, I'd definitely wear a mask on subways forever.  I've traveled to several Asian countries and it's just no big deal to see every other person with masks on in crowded places. i think it'll get like here in cities. Also, I have two family members with cancer who were told to wear masks in crowded public spaces. Before the pandemic, they felt awkward, with people staring at them.  Then..."
2021-05-17 11:29,"Depending on the situation and location, we'll keep ours on.  Especially, during cold and flu season.  Our family was at our healthiest during the pandemic. Not one illness made its way into our household.
We are all vaxxed. For those who have decided not to take the vaccine and run around unprotected without a care in the world. You're the reason why things aren't ""back to normal""."
2021-05-17 11:29,"As long as people are not getting vaccinated and we do not reach herd immunity there is a significant percent of the population who are at risk.  There is some evidence that vaccinations are not protective for  those individuals who have compromised immune systems.  About 3.6 % of Americans, 10 million people, are immunocompromised.  For these people it is essential that US citizens get vaccinated so that they can feel safe from the potentially deadly Covid 19 virus.  This is the only way they can live a life with out masks."
2021-05-17 11:29,"We were told to wear masks to protect others, but it seems beyond dispute that people believe the purpose of masking is to protect oneself. So, which is it? Frankly, the public health messaging on masks leaves something to be desired. 

My concern is that we may be transitioning from a situation in which conservatives refuse masking to prove they aren’t liberals to one in which liberals continue masking to prove they aren’t conservatives."
2021-05-17 11:29,"My question is if Masks have kept people from getting a cold or the flu this past winter maybe a mask in the winter months isn't such a bad idea. Maybe at airports and the grocery store? Well being more aware of how germs really spread is a good thing.
If anything a masks does keep one's nose warm."
2021-05-17 11:32,"The CDC guidance was way too premature.  In much of the country, most people are unvaccinated.  Now they are being given license to take off their masks without penalty, and they will all give it to each other.

As for myself, I have enjoyed that my hay fever has improved substantially, and I have not gotten a cold of any kind in over a year.  The mask is staying on for a while, although I won't be as strict about it as I had been before being vaccinated."
2021-05-17 11:34,Been wearing masks on airplanes since my bout with pneumonia in 2012. I have no intention of changing that.  Hopefully I never contract another flu or pneumonia again.
2021-05-17 11:34,"""People who choose to continue to cover their faces have become targets of public ire.""

Makes you wonder what those people feeling ""ire"" about someone else's harmless clothing choices have actually meant when they've been insisting for the past year on the importance of personal liberty."
2021-05-17 11:39,"I live in a VT county with a very high rate of vaccination. I am vaccinated. And I love my mask. I am not scared to go out, even to travel -- especially with a mask for indoors, and any kind of crowded situation available for quick masking up. I  love the fact that because of masking and distancing I had no colds this winter, and neither did my immunocompromised son. I love the fact that my 91 year mother stayed safe, and did not get her seasonal pneumonia. I love the fact that my allergies have diminished. Also that because of enhanced safety protocols in healthcare settings because of the pandemic, when I had major surgery in January, there was no infection of any kind.  I will wear my mask whenever I want. I do not care what others think. Covid 19 is going to be with us in some form or other, as long as it takes for folks to get their vaccines. Life will be a new normal -- which, given all that's wrong in this country, might be a good thing. I am uninterested in returning to the way things used to be. Free to choose. My body. Pro choice."
2021-05-17 11:42,"I am fully vaccinated and will continue to wear my mask indoors because I don't trust antivaxxers who will toss the mask and claim to be vaccinated. The rollback is only for fully vaccinated people, and I don't trust the honor system for those who don't believe in science."
2021-05-17 11:45,"I'm fully vaxed and will continue to wear masks when I go to stores, and medical appointments."
2021-05-17 11:45,"I am fully vaccinated, but wear the mask indoors, in crowded spaces, and in crowds outdoors, mostly as a courtesy to others.   I like that I didn't have a cold or flu in the past 15 months.  Not being ill is the ultimate freedom.  I like the mask"
2021-05-17 11:46,"Something that has to be recognized is that for a very long time masks were about the only tangible protection we had from a potentially deadly virus. Even vaccinated it’s hard to give that protection up especially when there are still so many unknowns. How are people to turn on a dime psychologically and abandon what protected them when they know many refuse vaccination, and variants are a real possibility? I wear a lightweight and very comfortable black Korean KF94 mask. I plan to continue wearing it in indoor public spaces. It’s cleaner, it’s safer, and not a burden to wear a mask. The majority of my friends will be doing the same for the foreseeable future and possibly permanently. What is so wrong with this? Masks for some of us are about courtesy and the desire not to spread germs or breath in other people’s germs. I feel safer in a mask. People can think what they want. I consider the mask smart not weird."
2021-05-17 11:48,"I'm fully vaxxed and will continue to wear a mask - maybe forever.   
 For the first time I am realizing how diseased the every day air I was breathing was pre-pandemic.  I have'nt bee sick since wearing the mask.

I take no pleasure in sharing airborne diseases (cold, flu, allergens) etc....

Two people I know died of Covid in April so the virus is still live and kicking.
I don't understand why it bothers people so much that others choose to wear a mask."
2021-05-17 11:49,"The whole family is fully vaccinated, but I'm still planning on mask wearing in the winter, at the very least.  It was nice not to have a cold this past year, and seems to be the polite thing to do - I have no idea if you are immunocompromised, as it's none of my business.  Plus, it kept my face from getting chapped in the winter and was less scratchy than a scarf!  Come fall I'll do a mask inventory and make sure I have enough winter colors."
2021-05-17 11:49,"Before the pandemic, I wore a mask each time I visited my VA hospital for appointments. I did so because I caught the flu on one emergency room visit and because of autoimmune illness, I wanted to avoid further infections. At the time, hospital staff panicked when I sat in the waiting room, with my mask on, and other patients without mask thought I was sick and contagious. I explained “I am wearing a mask to protect myself, not the other way around.” After a year of pandemic, people understand. I will continue my practice but will be maskless as often as possible because I have to stay healthy, and part of a healthy immune system is building resistance to everyday bacteria, which will not happen if I wear a mask all the time. I suggest the same for others but everyone is free to choose why they think is best. Nevertheless I still get a chuckle in how the tables are turned after a year of fear."
2021-05-17 11:50,"I was very disappointed in the CDC for changing the mask requirement without first soliciting input from individual states and health districts.  They have exacerbated a social and political flashpoint to the detriment of all Americans.  A more pragmatic approach would have been once vaccination rates reaced a certain level then mask use could be relaxed.  Perhaps both a national rate and regional rates.  They could have used this to bring a divided people together, instead causing confusion and dis-trust."
2021-05-17 11:50,"As a woman, I also like the anonymity. And I haven't had a stranger say ""smile"" to me in passing in 1.5 years. 

If anyone questions my mask use I say, this is a free country, isn't it?"
2021-05-17 11:52,"I know it's anecdotal but no one I know has been sick this year with the common ailments (colds, flu, some allergies, etc.). Distancing has, of course, been a big factor, but wearing a mask has probably been a positive contributor as well.

Also, why in the world does anyone care if someone else wears a mask? Even after the COVID wave ends, I think a lot of people have seen the benefits of wearing a mask. 

Nature has provided us with some valuable lessons this year. Some choose to learn from them. Others are just plain dim."
2021-05-17 11:53,"I'm fully vaccinated and enjoying going maskless in low-density situations. For now, I plan to keep on masking in crowded places like the grocery store. Given the level of Covid infections, emerging variants, and low-to-nonexistent rates of vaccination in much of the world, I suspect we'll have to go back to masking again before long; maybe as soon as this fall. In the meantime, this is a pleasant reprieve. Get vaccinated!"
2021-05-17 11:54,"Not only do I still appreciate masks, I find myself annoyed by unmasked people who get loud inside. I'm upset by acquaintances who refuse any precautions, but I'm becoming more adventurous as I remember I am vaccinated. Small steps."
2021-05-17 11:55,"Pandemic or not. Vaxed or not. Moving forward, I will continue to wear a mask only for medical appointments for the rest of my life."
2021-05-17 11:55,"Masking backlash — sigh — one more thing that makes it harder for parents of school age children that aren’t yet eligible to be vaccinated. One more thing that marks high risk tolerance as “freedom.”

High risk tolerance isn’t freedom and neither is selfishness.

We are continuing to wear our masks in solidarity with with our kid and our community until everyone is eligible for a vaccine (and probably for cold and flu season in the future)."
2021-05-17 11:55,This is the problem with the CDC. Their public health advice is demonizing people who recognize that the virus is airborne and can still put people in hospitals.
2021-05-17 11:57,"As far as I am concerned people can continue to wear masks if the wish. It really is not any of my business. It seems to me that my regimen of wearing masks when out amongst people shopping and such this past year and washing my hands every time I entered my home after being out shopping that I have not even contracted a cold this past year. This is the first year that I believe I have not contracted at least one cold. I have been getting seasonal Flu shots for decades and have never gotten the seasonal flu. There is no danger to anyone from a person who wears a mask so I am not sure why it is anyone other than the mask wearer's business. I have gotten my seasonal flu shot and have been fully vaccinated for covid-19 for about 3 months now so I am as about as protected as I can be under the circumstances. 
Live and let live as the saying goes."
2021-05-17 11:57,"For me, the CDC guidelines are clear enough and I'll abide by them, probably a bit more cautiously than requested, but the CDC should have coordinated with state health departments and federal and state public relations offices about the best way to roll out the new guidelines. That being said, the CDC has issued new guidelines, not mandates, and people will still have to follow state, local, school and business mandates on mask wearing. That hasn't changed. Like many other commenters here, I noticed a great reduction in my seasonal allergy symptoms when wearing a mask outside, so I'll keep doing that during allergy season."
2021-05-17 11:58,Kind of like the anonymity of wearing a mask as much as minimizing risk so I’ll keep it as an option.
2021-05-17 11:59,"I too decided to keep the mask on not really caring what anybody thinks. It's kind of a tribute to the number of lives that were saved by those who DID wear masks throughout the pandemic. Haven't had anyone approach me and ask why I still wear a mask yet but I have my answer already prepared in case that happens - -  ""Because I'm ugly, can I suggest one for you?"""
2021-05-17 12:00,"This virus is new and ever-changing, so it is wise to wear a mask until a full year has passed since people were vaccinated and even longer if someone chooses.

I plan to wear a mask when inside and honestly don't care what anyone thinks; I will do what I feel comfortable doing to stay safe and well."
2021-05-17 12:02,"A few years ago our city went through the threat of a lawsuit over an ordinance that applied only to women, requiring us to wear shirts. I’m pretty sure that it’s now not required anymore, but I don’t see anyone giving us grief about continuing to wear a shirt. 

I’ll definitely continue wearing a mask while indoors around strangers and I’ll probably also continue to wear a shirt too..."
2021-05-17 12:02,"I have 2 unvaccinated children, too young right now to qualify, so I will continue to mask when running errands.  I hope masking becomes acceptable going forward, people need to wear them when they are sick, if out in public, it was nice avoiding colds and stomach viruses this year.  Even helped my allergies."
2021-05-17 12:02,I’ll continue wearing mine for grocery shopping and other activities where I have to be around a lot of strangers. My husband is  vaccinated but has leukemia and is therefore more susceptible to any kind of infection; anyone who dares to comment will get a piece of my mind.
2021-05-17 12:02,"I don't plan on letting anyone else try to intimidate me over my mask choice. Somewhere along the line, a bullying segment of society made the false assumption that I can be told what to do by perfect strangers in a grocery line or parking lot..
We plan to keep mask wearing in public until we see how viral numbers look. My trust of an ""honor"" system, given the attitudes of those who refused to protect others by not wearing masks is non-existent.
They showed their community  safety  little respect, so do not ask me to trust them now. Do not ask me to care about their opinions  about this either.
My health, my safety, my vaccinated call to make."
2021-05-17 12:04,"I have an autoimmune disorder and all of my trips outside of my house are to medical appointments. I may never go out again, without wearing a mask."
2021-05-17 12:05,"To protect others, in the future, I plan to wear a mask in public should I have a cold or feel sick. Maybe too, if I'm going somewhere crowded in flu season. What's the big deal? If it's my right TO NOT wear one, isn't it my right TO wear one?"
2021-05-17 12:05,"Because of Covid, I started wearing a mask long ago.  I remember scrambling to find them ""back in the day"".  Heck, despairing of finding one in the drugstore or supermarket, I even considered going to Home Depot and getting one of those things painters use in dusty environments etc.

Since then, I've worn a mask whenever walking outdoors.  And both my condo in NY and the one in LA have required them whenever in shared spaces of the buildings.

I listened carefully to Gov. Cuomo who pointed out that we wear masks not to protect ourselves -- but to protect each other.

But now, I'm fully vaxxed.  And so is just about everyone I know (after all, I only ""hang"" with smart people!).

So it now occurs to me that with respect to Covid I am neither a threat to others nor are they any longer a threat to me.

Yes, I know vaccines aren't 100% effective.  But they are very effective.  And just as I get the annual flu shot and then ""take the risk"" by playing the odds -- so is the case now with Covid.

Frankly, I don't care if the unvaxxed wear masks or not.  They are now a risk only to themselves and their fellows.  If they want to play ""Covid Roulette"" with their health and lives -- that's their choice.

So while I'll wear a mask for a while longer in stores (and those condo buildings) it more out of courtesy than anything else.

Having played by all the ""rules"" and having gotten vaxxed as soon as I was able -- I am now going to start living my life normally again."
2021-05-17 11:37,"If you want to wear a mask into the future, that's perfectly great! I'm hoping we can permanently end the silly pre-pandemic social stigma against wearing them, and affirmatively encourage them for when folks feel sick.

That said, I hope that y'all don't judge those of us who decide to go sans mask. Even in this comment section, there seems to be a number of folks equating permanent mask wearing with superior morality. This seems misplaced. Speaking personally, I'd like to reclaim a sense of normalcy -- one that includes not having to wear a mask all the time -- and I don't think I'm a worse person for it"
2021-05-17 12:06,"I walk a lot.  In winter when it's cold I've always worn a mask to keep my face warm.  One thing I've discovered in warmer weather is that wearing a mask outside, I'm not coughing and wheezing from the regular environment as much as I was, especially when the grass is getting mowed nearby.   If I want to wear a mask, I'll wear one.  Be grateful that also means I'm not going to pass my cold onto you (when I'm sick I've been known to wear a mask too, just to avoid passing whatever I have on - it works)."
2021-05-17 11:31,"If almost 2/3rds of the population is still not vaccinated, then how is a merchant or business owner going to know OR TRUST who is?

If a publicly open business, it’s STILL BEST to require ALL persons to wear a mask, UNLESS YOU KNOW.

And, if you see somebody wearing a mask, outdoors perhaps, respect their fear,  because this disease is very cruel."
2021-05-17 12:07,"I just got my first Pfizer shot after much research. I was hesitant because of the quick rollout. The maskless CDC edict from the CDC is insensitive and careless. After getting vaxxed yesterday I stopped at Publix supermarket and saw lots of maskless people. My first reaction was how unfair this is to supermarket employees, many of whom may not be vaccinated for various reasons. Masks provide protection from many illnesses especially from the flu. As someone who has been hesitant about the vaccine, I sympathize with store employees who are sitting ducks susceptible to any contagious illness. And Covid is still contagious even to the vaccinated. Masks should be worn in indoor public places out of respect to workers."
2021-05-17 11:16,"Count me in.  Several right wing folks at work refuse to get vaccinated, for all the typical inane reasons, and also won't wear masks properly in the workplace, violating company policy.  When I complained to them, thy went to the supervisor who wrote a reprimand to me threatening to terminate my employment if I discussed vaccines or politics again.  I quit."
2021-05-17 12:07,"Throughout this pandemic my motto has been ""listen to the science."" So when the experts said to wear a mask to stop the spread, I did. Now that the experts are saying wearing one is no longer necessary when you're vaccinated, which makes sense, I'm not. 

During the earlier period, I was shocked by all the Republicans who refused to wear masks because they had become some kind of partisan tribe symbol. Those people undoubtedly contributed to spreading the virus and are therefore indirectly responsible for the deaths of their fellow citizens. Now it appears to me that masks become a partisan tribe symbol for many vaccinated Democrats as well, and that neither side is really ""following the science."" With that being said, wearing a mask when it is no longer necessary is harmless, whereas refusing to put one on when it is necessary for public health is not."
2021-05-17 12:08,"The masks are a pain but I must say I did not miss my usual sinus infection and sometimes tag along bronchitis this winter. If we were a considerate society, we would wear them in the winter for the sake of others. Imagine the days of work and productivity not lost to sickness in the winter."
2021-05-17 12:08,"Why is choice, part of our freedoms until, some make a choice that others don’t like.  Masks were about protecting others more so than yourself.  I have worn a mask since the guidance came out and I have worn a mask in public spaces and at work.  Knock on wood,I have not had the common cold, flu, stomach virus and thankfully COVID. Every year during cold and flu season, I get a nasty cold at least a couple of times. I have always thought that the cold has been contracted at work or the grocery store.  The masks work, and if people want to continue to do this to protect their health, who should care? If those who didn’t want to wear masks proclaimed personal freedom, well wearing masks are personal freedom too.  When I am not sick I have more productive days at work.  I will mask up as I see fit."
2021-05-17 12:08,"i just arrived in the US from Spain on Friday and got my 1st dose of vaccine on Saturday. I'm grateful I'm in California where masks are still required. I'm concerned about getting infected over these next 5 weeks , but more worried about infecting someone else during that time period."
2021-05-17 11:26,"Several days ago, upon the CDC's sudden announcement regarding vaccinated people no longer needing to wear masks, either indoors or outdoors, NYT op-ed columnist Zeynep Tufekci made the following point in her essay, ""Maybe We Need Masks Indoors Just a Little Bit Longer"": 

""And is the expectation that the unvaccinated will all simply go with the guidance and stay masked? That does not fit with what we’ve observed in this country over the past year, especially with the ongoing polarization over these questions.""

As she has been right from the the beginning of the pandemic on the sociological impact of a lethal and highly contagious disease in a world full of digitally generated misinformation and political polarization, she is spot on in this regard as well.

I will admit that in our pre-Covid world, I always looked at news footage of everyday East Asians going about their business wearing masks and feeling slightly squeamish or wondering, ""What's that all about?""  Now I get it.  And it makes me sigh with a sort of forgone conclusion that such communal cooperation to protect one another from communicable diseases will most likely never gain traction in the United States.

I frankly will not be surprised if going maskless at our current vaccination levels results in another surge, especially with the explosion in summer travel and tourism that is expected, beginning right now."
2021-05-17 12:11,"Risk is difficult to calculate as an individual. Variants from the high volume scourge in India are in NYC and the southeast with little ‘science’ to assess vaccine protection; long term symptoms- even without acute illness - are awful especially involving the brain.
So - for the small burden of masking indoors in public places it seems worth it for now.
Clearly selling the benefits of vaccines highlights unmasking freedom & economic 
Gains. Better safe than sorry is another POV."
2021-05-17 12:12,"This should have been going on pre covid ie with the flu like they do in Asia and also post covid. 

We employed two extremes measures before no defense against the flu (the shots are highly ineffective from everything I experienced personally, read or experienced with friends and family. The last year, seven yrs ago,  I took the shot as a senior it was only 19% effective and I came down with a bad reaction ie 101.5 fever for three days, Few people ever wore a mask, social distanced or washed hands which works much better than the flu shot now almost everybody except for right wing fanatics do it 24/7.

The point being post covid re the flu there should be a happy medium, washing hands more, selective social distance and mask wearing as least in the winter."
2021-05-17 11:31,"With the growing prevalence of police body cams and other public surveillance, why not use this as an excuse to keep the masks on for just a little bit more anonymity? Let’s keep the masks on. (Yes aware that facial recognition, etc, can “defeat” a mask)"
2021-05-17 12:15,"Though the CDC has bungled the mask announcement/timing, I am vaccinated and will stop mask wearing (now that my State ended the mask mandate last Friday). If a business still requires it, certainly will wear one. It is quite ok if people choose to still mask! Will kindness ever return in this country?"
2021-05-17 12:15,"It will be interesting to see if the Republican states pass laws forbidding the wearing of masks in public. They'll couch it in terms of safety and reducing anonymity to reduce crime, or some such nonsense. Their ""principle"" of individual freedom will quickly fly out the window in favor of social conformity."
2021-05-17 12:16,"I’m fully vaxxed and still wearing a mask. I hope it reassures clerks in the grocery store and others who work with the public. I also am happy to protect myself from other airborne illnesses. I used to be more cavalier about getting sick (but always stayed home from work  to avoid spreading it). “That’s what our immune systems are for!,” I thought. Not anymore. Why be sick if I don’t have to, with COVID or anything else?"
2021-05-17 12:16,"I ride commuter trains and pick up cruddy colds and flus every year.  COVID is the excuse, not the reason, for me to wear a mask."
2021-05-17 12:17,The prevalence of facial recognition software in everyone’s pocket and creepy male gazers on every corner are two good incentives to stay masked up in public. I have so enjoyed moving through the world a bit more anonymously this past year.
2021-05-17 12:18,"No matter what guidance the CDC offers, there will be folks who question that guidance. One thing that Dr. Walensky said the other day resonated with me - the bottom line is that it is an individual choice whether one wears or doesn’t wear a mask.

Personally, I’ll wear a mask outside for as long as I please. Any assumptions that would be made about me do not matter. Whatever assumptions I might make about anyone else, masked or unmasked, I’ll keep to myself."
2021-05-17 12:18,"I very much appreciated an entire winter without getting so much as a head cold.  I intend to continue to wear a mask when in grocery stores, on buses and trains, or anywhere else I will be in a crowd indoors."
2021-05-17 12:19,"I worked in a grocery store deli throughout the entire pandemic. When everyone there was masked (finally) we all as workers had fewer sick days. Sure, people still called out after a hangover, but no one got a cold or any other of annoying illnesses that typically go around a tight working space. I am all for wearing a mask as a food worker—we already follow other rules of food sanitation including wearing gloves and mask wearing significantly cuts down on call outs from other workers."
2021-05-17 11:50,I’m fully vaxxed and wearing my mask inside buildings but not outside. I still get filthy looks no matter what I do at this time.
2021-05-17 12:03,"Just because you may be paranoid, it doesn’t mean the virus isn’t after you. You may have only one chance to get it wrong. They’ve been wearing masks in crowded cities in Asia for a long time, even without a pandemic."
2021-05-17 12:20,"I never thought I would be publicly targeted but, in just the last 2 days, I feel less safe than before...
I live in a more diverse (poor) part of town and went to the post office Saturday. They were still social distancing and asked many of us who all were wearing masks to wait in the lobby or outside so no more than 4 people could go in, no one had a problem with this, we all chatted and agreed we’d be wearing our masks longer, as we will not know who actually has been vaccinated. I then went to a grocery store in a nicer part of town ( I live in a bit of a food desert) and no one, not even the workers were wearing masks. I was given obvious looks, and several remarks were made near and about my wearing a mask. This upset me and scared me. I have not harassed anti maskers, now because I want to still be safe, I will now have to endure harassment from them. I was chastised for the last year as well for wearing a mask at work, we are in an open area of the office, people thought I was just paranoid to wear a mask all the time (most took them off at their desk , then just forgot to put them back on) but I stayed strong and stayed away from arguing. I am so sad for our country and our future. We clearly do not respect any one with differing opinions and we are becoming more and more polarized. We can’t heal literally or figuratively without acceptance of one another."
2021-05-17 12:20,"Masks may be appealing to those with mild obsessive disorder. I say let them be. They may come out eventually. As long as they dont act out and carry on to the rest of us. 

After wearing the things all the time, it does feel weird without, even for non obsessive me. My tendencies are a bit impulsive. And i have to care more about how i look. Again weird feeling."
2021-05-17 11:43,"It’s America, do and wear what you want. Both sides, enough already."
2021-05-17 12:22,"No one is more pro-vax than I, who formerly worked the the Vanderbilt scientists who developed the Moderna vaccine. I got my shots the millisecond they were available. As a life sciences editor, I fully understand all risks and the biology behind them. I happily wore my mask. That said, I listened to the CDC and went to an OUTSIDE landscaping business yesterday. I know the owner, who said it was fine to walk around unmasked, as I was vaxxed. You’d have thought I was waking around killing puppies. Several older women made loud comments while glaring at me about how RUDE and irresponsible it is to not wear a mask, even when fully vaxxed. My point: If the fully vaxxed keep wearing mask everywhere, what incentive do the non-vaxxed have to get their shots? Read the fantastic NYT article on the creative incentives for people to get vaxxed; e.g., you can attend baseball games in a special section, mask free. My critics in the begonia section seemed more concerned with virtue signaling than either science or behavioral economics."
2021-05-17 12:24,"I am fully vaccinated.  I am also 71 years of age.  And I watched many during this pandemic disdain masking and other precautions due possibly to listening to the rantings of a fool.

Yet during the past year I never confronted a person not wearing a mask.  But I also felt those persons would be respectful of others in the attempts to slow the spread of covid-19.

So now, it is their turn, the “never maskers” to be tolerant of those who still choose to wear the mask."
2021-05-17 12:25,"Every morning I look at the front page of the Times to see what the covid risk warning is for the state. In over a year, we have dropped from extremely high risk to very high risk. 

Knowing that New York City will be visited by people from other states and other parts of the world that have yet to have a substantial number of residents or citizens vaccinated, and that dangerous variance are on their way here, doesn't it make sense that we stay the course of mask wearing until the risk level drops to low or no risk?"
2021-05-17 12:06,I will continue wearing masks for the foreseeable future. Why should I risk my health because others feel their egos and stupidity must be accommodated?
2021-05-17 11:31,I liked the previous articles on this subject where vaccinated people said they would continue wearing masks just so they wouldn't be mistaken for Republicans or ....members of the Fox's Nation !! ....To each his own....some people are cautious...some not so much...!! I'll never forget the helicopter ride Trump took to get over his bout of the Hoax created by the Democrats....poor man...if he had only listened to the Science....he could have saved himself the grief and the American taxpayers some money. A mask would have been a lot cheaper than his flight and high end medical treatment !!  I say Mask On America..esp. next Flu Season !!
2021-05-17 12:10,The last paragraph shows women who would rather cover their face than show it without makeup. What a bummer that we can’t just accept naked female faces. For myself I feel “unprofessional” without makeup. Hopefully something good could come from this year and we could relax some of our ridiculous female beauty standards
2021-05-17 12:05,"You’d think people would realize that masks are going to be extremely useful once again during flu season. Masks aren’t just for covid, people!"
2021-05-17 12:27,"Lost amid the viral responses is the fact that CDC's guidance recognizes a sizeable number of immuno-compromised people who remain vulnerable to COVID19 infection and severe illness even after being fully vaccinated.
I have worn masks, including outdoors, at various times in the past six years, did so diligently since COVID19 and will continue doing so since the full vaccination I have received is very much a hail mary against catastrophic harm from COVID infection.
I hope no one leans in too close to laugh at my personal masking decision after the carelessly presented and reported CDC 'guidance'."

Nobody yells at them. Grow up. And lead you own life"
2021-05-17 12:30,"Please keep in mind that the person(s) you see wearing a mask may not yet be vaccinated, or they may work with a group pf people who aren't yet vaccinated (teachers). I expect to see a blend of masked and unmasked people for some time."
2021-05-17 12:31,"As a patriotic, well informed vaccinated American I will always wear my mask when requested—but enjoy the freedom of not wearing the mask other times if I feel comfortable.  It’s not confusing, its not political, it’s simple.  Get vaccinated and enjoy your life."
2021-05-17 12:31,"I may continue to wear a mask outside and inside in perpetuity…as someone with a facial deformity, not getting all those stares is refreshing and empowering. And who really benefits from interacting face-to-face with strangers in public? I think we’d be better off if we all masked in public; it would allow us to see strangers as neutered—and therefore neutral—identities. It would make it easier easier to just stay in your lane in public so you can quickly return to the people and the life you already know. And hooray for no smaller illnesses too!"
2021-05-17 12:31,I plan to continue to wear a mask indoors in public places such as big stores or any crowded indoor venue. Nothing has really changed my perception of danger since a majority of people are not completely vaccinated and there is no way to distinguish the vaccinated. People who have delayed getting the vaccine may well be anti-maskers also and thus cannot be trusted not to heedlessly infect others.
2021-05-17 12:32,"It seems we may end up with an odd situation in which fully vaccinated people continue to wear masks, while unvaccinated people do not."
2021-05-17 12:32,"If recent history has taught us anything, it's that a second epidemic will occur not long after the first one. Can Americans (for once) learn a lesson from history?"
2021-05-17 12:33,"Such an irony. First, some individuals refused  masks, citing that they would not be deprived of their personal freedoms. Now some are angry because others are making a choice to exercise their right to continue masking even while vaccinated? I live in a state that officially abandoned the mask mandate last week.  What I observe is most people continuing to mask while shopping. This includes everything from grocery stores to outdoor gear retailers. According to the NYT daily covid update, my county is still 5% positivity and 45% of adults are fully vaccinated. Hardly herd immunity."
2021-05-17 12:33,"The elephant in the room, in my mind, is the CDC head making a declaration on masks, we are all familiar with now, with seemingly ne’er a consult or conversation with anyone regarding the public policy side of change and implementation. This has been so stressful for me, I am suddenly not sleeping well. 

That said, The NY Times recently did a piece on the spread of Covid outside being negligible and the miscommunication by the CDC “over stating” the risk, akin to shark attacks a year being less than 20,000 when they are more like 150. The CDC was using less than 10perc risk, which is true, but not accurate since it’s more like less than 0.01perc. This is a pretty good amount of detail provided by the NYT, so why would the CDC not start there? Unless you’re in a tight crowd, being outside does not require a mask! Imagine that update! This is how taking steps the majority of the population can take is done when updating policy, especially public policy. 

Now businesses, churches, and governments are scrambling, people are frustrated, and those of us who voted for Biden know that those who did not will bear no moral compass wrt mask wearing over not being vaccinated b/c they didn’t want either to begin with - no mask, no vaccine. 

Vaccination rates had already slowed down and this poorly thought out tactic to get more vaccinated has dropped the ball on strategy to get us out of this pandemic. This is very depressing and very stressful."
2021-05-17 12:33,"The article is accurate but ignores a a significant segment of the population: those who are immunocompromised, even minimally. We don't know how much protection we have from vaccines even though most of us are fully vaccinated. I know of two people who take heavy duty immunosuppressive drugs for medical conditions who checked their antibody status after full vaccinations and had zero antibodies (no protection). We will all continue with masking in many situations. The immunocompromised were excluded from the vaccine trials and there is still very limited data. We cannot receive boosters. That would trigger World War 3."
2021-05-17 12:33,"Being without comorbidities apart from age, 77, I wore a mask during the height of the pandemic when in a situation where it was required, e.g. in a store.  Outside, I rarely wore one but did practice social distancing.

Now that mask rules are relaxing, I feel no compunction to wear one.  Having had my shots 3 months ago, I do not feel I am a danger to others and feel little danger for myself.

I know people who still wear one in most circumstances and consider many of them paranoid.  However, if that makes them feel safer, so be it.  Just don't call me out if I choose not to do so."
2021-05-17 11:46,"I have an idea. Mind your own business. Live and let live. Who am I, or anybody else for that matter, to judge or decide what others fear or suffer from? That was my response to somebody who made fun of people that they spotted wearing masks in their own cars. Do you personally those people?

No?

Then shut up and get on with your busy day.  Why does it even bother you? Have you nothing else better to do? It’s not your face that’s covered. Move on.

If you ask current mask wearers why they wear a mask, you might be surprised at what you learn."
2021-05-17 12:27,Those who politicize the wearing of masks illustrate their insecurity and not that of mask wearers.
2021-05-17 12:34,"I'll keep wearing a mask when unknowns without them are around. if they ask me why I'm still wearing one, I'll just say: ""because you're not""."
2021-05-17 11:32,"Wear a mask and people will think you are unvaccinated?  Vaccinated, take your mask off, and feel guilty for some reason?  

What COVID has done to our minds.  Not enough we couldn’t even hug our grandkids for over a year - now we have to look at that piece of cloth or paper with strings that has been part of our nose and mouth, and ask ourselves “should I or not today?”  Is the CDC giving it to us straight?  Are they going to announce “sorry, we made a mistake in the beginning of May about taking your masks off”?  Without a mask am I going to be obsessing over every little sneeze, that it might mean something more?  Or that I might be carrying some COVID cells and pass them on to the innocent?  

What an experience.....help!"
2021-05-17 12:01,"Every spring there are a few trees species in NYC that shed a pollen which gets into and coats my throat. It feels like something I have spasms of terrible coughs for several minutes in an effort to get rid of it. Last year that didn’t happen, thanks to wearing a mask. So far this spring it’s been the same. I plan on wearing a mask every spring during the time when this pollen attacks me. If it’s a choice between spasmodic coughs or strange looks from passers by , there’s no contest. I will just happily cuss out the idiots under my mask."
2021-05-17 12:37,"I loved not getting sick last year. I'll continue to mask in cold and flu season. I do wonder though, if I'm diminishing my immune system though. I figure I've had almost no exposure to any germs for almost a year and a half."
2021-05-17 12:37,"When your work involves people who mostly see you for worsening shortness of breath, increased cough, and/or sputum production, occasionally with fevers, this puts an entirely new perspective on it. 

When you have personally contracted a respiratory viral illness (not COVID) from a patient, you are much less likely to not wear a mask at work. 

Outside, and when distant from people, I may not mask. But when a large part of this country’s populace believes that guns protect them from some inchoate boogeyman more than masks (or vaccines) do from this very real illness, I will wear a mask around the unvaccinated hordes (herds?) for the foreseeable future, regardless of CDC guidelines. 

Respectfully,

A Pulmonary and Critical Care Physician."
2021-05-17 12:37,"Me, too, fully vaccinated and very ecstatic to be so, AND I plan to continue to double-mask indoors, on airplane flights, public transport, etc, indefinitely. I am very happy to pull my single mask under my chin outdoors while not in crowds. I think there will be a lot of unvaccinated free riders around without masks - let's out them rather than harass vaccinated mask wearers."
2021-05-17 12:37,"A bonus of wearing a mask has been the huge decrease in colds and flu.  I expect I will feel quite comfortable wearing a mask in public places for a few more months.  I would love to permanently get rid of the full handshake, however, replacing it with a fist or elbow bump.  Handshakes spread colds more than almost anything imo."
2021-05-17 12:14,"I live in a relatively compliant blue state but I’m surrounded by anti-maskers, anti-vaxxers, Trump supporters. I had Covid in late October.  I could only have been infected one of 2 ways:

1.  By a maskless golfer who played 18 holes with another maskless golfer who had been infected but didn’t yet know.  

or

2. On one of the few nights that I went out to dinner (indoors) with the unknowingly infected maskless golfer where the waitstaff was fully masked, the diners were not, and the tables were at least 6 feet apart.

In both cases everyone followed CDC guidelines.

I’ve been playing pickle ball indoors all winter wearing a mask.  At least half of the people there pulled their masks down while they were playing.  Last week, before this new indoor mask guidance, I was the only person there still wearing a mask.  Someone who is vaccinated asked me why I was still wearing a mask?  

On Friday I went to play again.  There was a clinic that I hadn’t been informed about and the place was jammed.  I was the only person wearing a mask. I got many puzzled and some outright hostile looks.

On Saturday I got a haircut.  The employees told me they were very concerned about unvaccinated people not wearing masks.  They had already had to turn away people who refused to mask including someone who threatened to sue them including a woman insisting that she didn’t have to wear a mask because the CDC said so.

I think it’s going to get ugly.  Or perhaps I should say uglier.  I’m furious."
2021-05-17 12:38,"We know the CDC was wrong. Did it really take the CDC 14 months to admit how this virus spreads? I am fully vaccinated. Masks on for me indefinitely. I realize messaging to the public is a complex process with many nuanced variables, including estimating how long the generally uninformed public will sustain their interest. Some of us are interested in scientific method, accurate information and efficacy more than whether or not a safety protocol for oneself and others is convenient or not.  Taking into account that we are not uniting the world and instituting the Green New Deal to save our species and all other life on earth after all, new and ancient diseases .are. the new normal."
2021-05-17 12:36,"I really don't care what officials say or if some politician says it is okay to unmask. That is just bad science.  In last Friday's NYT, one article covered the CDC unmasking story while another told of a number of airport workers (India?) who were fully vaccinated that contracted Covid. 

There seems to be an American weakness for falling prey to magical thinking about the virus. It's not over yet and only fools will behave as though it is. We do not have enough people vaccinated in this country to reach herd immunity and there is a question about ever getting to that point. 

My wife and I don't wear masks when walking or hiking outside away from crowds, but in a store or other more densely occupied place we do so religiously.  Let's talk next year about this subject. In the mean time, we are standing our ground!"
2021-05-17 12:39,"Let's not get dramatic. I am ""out and about"" a lot lately and have not heard a single person ask someone else to take their masks off. In fact, it is the opposite. Even in a mask-less environment in Savannah, GA, where I am now visiting, most stores have a mask mandate to enter and lots of folks are still walking the streets with masks on. I haven't heard anyone ask me or anyone else to take their mask off."
2021-05-17 12:39,"Apparently many people are superficial and unsophisticated about the reasons why some others are still wearing masks (there are many reasons including personal health reasons and yes it is still perfectly normal even to be paranoid), I hope wearing mask with MAGA, US flag or Confederate battle flag will be more acceptable to these people."
2021-05-17 12:22,"The ire is caused by experience.  When all this started health experts said masks were not needed by the general public.  The paranoid protested this direction calling for masks.  Those in power caved.  After many long months those in power are once again trying to say masks are not needed.  Once again the paranoid are trying to say we need to keep them on.  How long until they start protesting and the people in power cave again.

I don’t care what anyone else wears, but experience has shown those that are running around scared will not be happy keeping their paranoia to themselves!"
2021-05-17 12:39,"We still don’t know what we don’t know.   How long are the vaccines good for?  No one knows.    What about the over 100 million unvaccinated?   Bill Maher an eight Yankee players, fully vaccinated, caught the virus.   Are vaccinated people still vulnerable?   Will other strains evolving,   will the vaccines protect the public still?   The CDC says, nothing to see here, move on with your lives unmasked.   It seems hasty.    The CDC must “recommend “ mask wearing, hand washing; use of sanitizers if traveling in public transport; houses of worship; indoor concerts; theaters, supermarkets and other indoor places of mass gatherings.    It’s not difficult."
2021-05-17 12:28,"If I was Joe Glickman, I would wear a mask.  He does not sound like he has a robust immune system, to me.  It may have nothing to do with Covid, it may be why he got Covid despite all his precautions.  Mask on, Mr. Glickman.
For everybody: wear a mask if you think it benefits you.  Don't wear a mask if you feel you don't need to.
And let it all go. Just let it go!"
2021-05-17 12:40,I'm immunocompromised and intend to wear a mask in public for the rest of my life (I take immunosuppressants for rheumatoid arthritis).  My partner will probably wear a mask until COVID is completely gone.  Let someone complain in my direction; my response will not be kind.  My wearing a mask has zero effect on them.  Some people need to mind their own business.
2021-05-17 12:40,"I find masks to be a helpful utilities that are now more socially commonplace. I don't feel compelled to wear one all the time now that Im vaccinated, but I will do it when I feel its courteous, and a side effect is that it helps keep my allergies down!"
2021-05-17 12:36,"""I'd like to be around as long as I can""....EXACTLY Mr. Jones. Nothing wrong with that at all. If wearing a mask makes you feel more secure WEAR IT.
 Don't ever think of being ashamed while wearing a mask in public. I see it as a badge of honor and applaud you for it. You are thinking of someone other then yourself. Hats off to you!
 Keep up the good work.
 P.S. My wife has COPD, usually gets a severe bout of cold and bronchitis every winter. This past winter NOTHING!  We attribute the mask with that good thing in our life. NOT SICK!"
2021-05-17 12:22,"I am so enjoying all these comments. These are the very same people who have yelled for 15 months, follow the science, pay attention to the CDC guidelines, do what the doctor say etc. etc. etc. Now they’re not so much in favor of following the CDC guidelines or Dr. Fauci or the scientist. It’s really quite funny. I personally do not care if someone wears a mask or not. I am fully VAX and have no plans to wear a mask anywhere.  All of these people who keep saying it’s my choice whether to wear a mask or not, where were you all when the unmaskers were walking around making their choice. I don’t remember you giving them any respect."
2021-05-17 12:41,"Next time years?  Not sure about that.  But staying with a mask?  Better safe than sorry!  

After this Pandemic, I can see the future is an unknown.  But a mask is one known.  And for now I’m sticking with it.

Make fun of me if you like.  I don’t care.  But at 76, I intend to be very cautious.  Both for my sake and the sake of my son.  He’s able to take care of himself at nearly 52, but he’s very sensitive.  And caring.  Now that I’m a widow (since 2019) I’ve depended on him a lot and he’s been very understanding.  I don’t want to worry him or leave him bereft."

2021-05-17 12:43,The article references people who plan on wearing masks.   I agree.  Where is the information about backlash.   Why suggest it if there is not evidence.
2021-05-17 11:43,"Before the masks, I caught colds and flu every year.  Since the mask, haven't caught a one.  So I think I'll keep the mask.  Don't like it?  Well, I think you know what you can do with your disapproval."
2021-05-17 11:17,"So now we have two levels of illogic: (1) I won't wear a mask because it infringes on my ""freedom"" and (2) nobody else should wear a mask even if they choose to do so.  Whaaaaat?"
2021-05-17 12:15,Please keep in mind that 48 million Americans have some level of hearing loss requiring us to lipread to understand you. It’s been hellish for us. Life without seeing smiles is also depressing.
2021-05-17 12:44,"People keep referencing Asian mask wearing. I lived in Asia for three years. Yes, people wore masks to be polite to others. But, it was generally only when they were sick and had to be out around others. It was not a permanent thing based on phobias for most.

I think the CDC jumped the gun a bit on relaxing mask mandates so much. However, based on the science, it would have come fairly soon even without the political pressure. Keep wearing those masks in public if you choose to. Just remember that it isn’t completely impact-free for other people with whom you interact. The expressions on your face when speaking play a major role in communication."
2021-05-17 12:44,"I am fully vaccinated. I wore a mask and practiced social distancing for the past year. I will have no problem continuing to wear a mask when I enter places of business.

However, I want to breath fresh air when I'm walking outside on the city sidewalks. Walking is one of my favorite activities and I don't want to feel the judgement of others for being mask-less in the outdoors. I've read that transmission is less than 1percent in the open air. Hope that's OK with folks."
2021-05-17 12:45,"Here is something I don't fully understand.  A ""Close Contact"" is defined as interaction with someone within 6 feet for 15 minutes during a 24 hour period.

seems straightforward.

How many of the interactions that people are worried about fit that bill.  The subway  or movie theater is one thing.  But outside or even in a grocery store...how often are people actually within 6 feet of anyone for 15 minutes?"
2021-05-17 12:46,"Drive-thru orders at fast-food restaurants are the new norm. If customers are unable to wash their hands before eating, why aren’t these restaurants required to include a disinfectant hand wipe with each meal? That makes sense to me, but local health boards are oblivious."
2021-05-17 12:23,"How about ‘live and let live’ on the masks? Or goggles even.

Agree with Dan Rather — why should you care? You don’t know what increased individual risks a person might have. Or someone in their household. Even if they are “just anxious”. Whatever.

They might not be completely vaccinated yet. And are behaving responsibly.

Not your problem anymore. Let it go.

The next round, where we might need masks again, could come soon enough. Right now risks, per Biden admin, such that general mask wearing no longer required.

Enjoy it while we can."
2021-05-17 12:46,"I work in a small retail store.  While I do get tired of wearing a mask for 7 to 8 hours a day, I no longer miss having to endure assisting clients with bad breath, that spit when they talk or just plain openly cough and sneeze.  This has also been the first year of my career that I did not get sick."
2021-05-17 12:47,"Like Dan Rather, I don't see how me wearing a mask infringes on anyone else's freedom.  I am immune suppressed.  I have been successfully vaccinated.  Also, for the last two masked years, I haven't gotten my annual severe bronchitis or pneumonia.  I live in a very high risk state with insufficient numbers of people vaccinated and going mask free.  Why does anyone else care if I take precautions to protect myself?"
2021-05-17 12:47,"People seem to be unclear about the roles
of the CDC and  p u b l i c  health.

They are responsible for the health of a society, a nation, a region. 

They are not responsible for your 
p e r s o n a l  individual health. They couldn’t possibly be.

We are now at the stage where everybody needs to do what they do with any other personal health issue. You educate yourself and make an informed decision. Maybe consult an individual health care practitioner."

2021-05-17 12:48,"I will continue to wear my mask as will my whole family and we are mostly all vaccinated- exception being my kiddo who is 5.  If we aren't even near heard immunity... the CDC guidence makes no sense. I have a vulnerable family we all have asthma.  We have all remained healthy and no corona virus or any others over the last 14 months. And all due to lots of precautions. 

So sorry... we are mask 😷  on until they come up with treatments that conclusively help."
2021-05-17 12:48,"I'm fully vaccinated, but I will be keeping my mask on! As someone who's self esteem and body image issues have often caused me debilitating anxiety about being seen and judged, masks have been incredibly freeing. For the past year I've been able to decide to go to the store and then go, without devolving into a panic attack about being ""so ugly I should just stay home."" I've even started initiating small talk with cashiers from behind the privacy of my mask. The end of masks would mean a retreat back into my house to waste so much time fighting my brain.
(For the record, I know the solution to my problem is not masks but therapy. But therapy takes a long time and masks are a welcome shortcut!)"
2021-05-17 12:49,"There are plenty of legitimate reasons for being hesitant to mask free.  For starters, someone could have a compromised immune system, and be afraid of breakthrough COVID.  Give them all a break.  COVID was a major trauma for human society."
2021-05-17 12:50,"My hairdresser told me that he hadn’t had a single cold or illness this year because he’s been wearing a mask at work. When I thought of the many people he comes in close contact with during the course of just one day I thought it would be wise to continue wearing a mask at his establishment and whenever I go out in public. This was the first year that I also didn’t have some cold or sore throat. The Japanese have it right, wear a mask and protect others and stay healthy yourself."
2021-05-17 12:50,"I plan to be cautious and keep masking until we can be certain that this lifting of the mandate does not cause another surge. Also, when I wear a mask, I feel that I am showing respect for the victims and solidarity with those around the world who cannot get vaccines. It seems so hubristic to begin the partying when so many around the world are years away from getting their shots."
2021-05-17 12:51,I am fully vaccinated and keeping my mask on. As a RN I am not happy with the CDC’s decision to allow vaccinated people to stop wearing masks. We are nowhere near herd immunity and children under 12 can’t be vaccinated. I do not trust that all the people walking around without a mask are actually vaccinated. Working during Covid was traumatizing and I do not want us to surge again.
2021-05-17 12:52,"I liked the mask. It allowed me to go out in public with no pressure to smile or, for that matter, have any expression at all if I didn't want to produce one for the general public. I live in a state where people bellow ""How's your day goin' so far?"" which is right up there with saying  ""Awesome!"" 50 times a minute as a signal the person saying it is feeble of brain and best avoided. 

I liked the stealth factor, and I'm going to continue wearing a mask in the supermarket or store. This isn't over. I have asthma, and my 47-year-old neighbor across the hall got Covid in March 2020, and a stroke in April, directly attributed to complications from Covid. 

Hoax, my foot. 

Like someone wearing a raincoat when it's not raining or Timberlands when there isn't any construction going on - or someone outside in a t-shirt when it's 25 degrees, it bothers me not at all what costume folks wish to don or not don when appearing in public.

Please extend me the same courtesy. For a while I was wearing a plague mask on a scooter in my neighborhood. Not a peep. A few photos, though. 

As George Harrison said in ""Beware of Darkness,"" ""take care/beware."""
2021-05-17 12:52,"The downside is always on the side of not wearing mask. While we can ""accidentally"" kill somebody in a pandemic, we cannot accidentally kill somebody by being ""over"" cautious, by wearing mask ourselves.

This is a novel virus and there is still much we do not know about it. Therefore it is limited what science can tell us, and what science does tell us, only time can verify if it is 100% accurate. No malicious intent intended.

I shall join Mr. Glickman, at least for a while."
2021-05-17 12:53,"I seem to be in the minority here, but I'm thrilled to no longer have to wear a mask! I haven't been wearing one outside, but of course still wear one on the subway and indoors as requested by businesses. Has it been weird? A little, at first. But I believe I've got to 'get back on the horse' and get back to normal. Believe in the science of the vaccines over reactive emotion. This was how I was raised and how I operate in other parts of my life.

For everyone saying that masks have prevented cold and flu from circulating this year - perhaps that's more a result of kids not in school, office workers not at the office, no flying / meetings / movie theaters / subways / restaurants, etc. 

This has been an isolating and miserable year for me, and I'm thrilled to go back to normal. Real normal, not ""new normal"". It's like a cloud is lifting. I'll take my average of 1-2 colds per year in exchange for the freedom of living life without a mask, as I have for the previous thirty-some years of my life. Though I do plan to wear a mask if I'm feeling under the weather to avoid spreading it to others."
2021-05-17 12:53,"The article calls masking a ""political flash point"" but doesn't identify how that started: with Donald Trump. He weaponized the face covering and Americans have paid the consequences, likely in of thousands of lives.

Personally, I plan to continue wearing mine for the foreseeable future. While I trust the vaccine, I also know it's not 100% effective and don't see a need to take risks while the virus is still circulating in our dense urban environments."
2021-05-17 12:53,"The virus mutates rapidly.  A large pool of unvaccinated public is provides a fertile population. We  can expect a future variant will defeat current vaccines, we will be slow to react, we will be back in pandemic mode again. Enjoy this wonderful moment, but wear a mask."

2021-05-17 12:45,The same people who were enraged because the CDC violated their 'freedom' by mandating masks are now completely at ease with violating my freedom to wear one.  Got it.
2021-05-17 12:54,"I talked with several friends yesterday.  All expressed surprise and disappointment about the new CDC edict, and said they would continue to wear their masks in public.  Their reasoning was the same:  no vaccine offers 100% protection, and even a mild case of covid can seriously damage your health, even permanently.  I expect they'll stick with these plans. These are people in their 60s - 70s.  They don't care what people think."
2021-05-17 12:42,"Land of the free, home of the brave should be able to handle if someone wants to wear a mask. With 585,572 people who have died in the US, we should respect their lives with precautions- get vaccinated and wear a mask. There is no getting back to normal, Covid is the new normal."
2021-05-17 12:55,Have a look at the influenza statistics for the past 12 months. They alone make a good case for continued mask wearing at least during flu season. And the most likely path for COVID is continued outbreaks over the years to come. Masks are here to stay for some of us.
2021-05-17 12:55,"Unless you are wearing an N95 mask, wearing a mask is for protecting other people - not to protect yourself.  So I don’t understand the CDC guidance that unvaccinated people who do not wear a mask are only endangering themselves."
2021-05-17 12:52,"I live in Texas and have very fair skin. In addition to protecting me and others from Covid, a mask protects the lower half of my face from the sun. I plan to keep wearing mine."
2021-05-17 12:51,"We talk about masks protecting us from covid, but when was the last time you had a cold?  And what happened to the flu season this past year?  Masks protect us from more than just covid.  There will be most times when I wont wear a mask like in the past, but there may be other times and in other places that I will put it on in the future."
2021-05-17 12:56,"""For a number of so-called perma-maskers, the decision is informed by trauma: They endured the coronavirus or witnessed loved ones die, and they say taking off their mask makes them feel terrifyingly vulnerable.""

Nope. I haven't had covid. I don't know anyone who has died from it.  I still intend on wearing masks indoors.  I can't check every person's vaccine record.  I can't know if every person in a store is healthy.  I don't want colds. I don't want the flu. I don't want to smell people's perfume, air ""fresheners"", overly scented clothing, or any of the other vile smell people wear."
2021-05-17 12:57,"I had always thought maybe the widespread use of masks in Asia was just a fashion.  Now I see there’s something to it.  In the past year I haven’t had a single cold.  If a simple mask, worn in public places, can keep me healthy, it’s a good thing.  There’s nothing political about it."
2021-05-17 12:45,"Many of these who object to other people wearing masks must be among those who marched around with their assault rifles to protest the mask mandate because it infringed on their ""personal freedom"". It is interesting now how little they are concerned with the ""personal freedom"" of others who choose to continue wearing a mask. Cut the hypocrisy and mind your own business."
2021-05-17 12:19,"People just want something to fight about. Whether it’s in favor of something or against it. Our species is pathetic and pretty despicable in that way. And the media will just keep fanning the flames on everything because fear and conflict is the fuel that generates the dollars that enrich the media companies. “The media’s real job, financially, is to get the viewer or reader to the next advertisement.” This was explained to me by the former newsroom director at CBS, who left the industry for that reason and became a college instructor. No doubt his position was quickly filled. So somebody “stares” at you in public, big deal."
2021-05-17 12:57,"Thinking back, I realized that every time I flew, I returned with a cold or some other respiratory issue.   But this year - nothing.
So I’ll be masking up on the plane from now on."
2021-05-17 12:58,"A lot of people are missing the point of the CDC recommendation, which is that vaccination, not masks, is what protects you from contracting the virus. Masks help, but are nowhere near as effective as a vaccine.

There is a small minority of people that can’t get vaccinated, but for the most part there is a huge number of people that can but are choosing not to. There are plenty of vaccines available, appointments are easy to get. 

Compared to a vaccine, masks are a charade. Why should we keep it up when vaccines are what will ultimately stop people from getting killed (and again, I know some can’t, but that’s a small portion and in the mean time the lack of vaccination from others puts those people at risk)?"
2021-05-17 12:58,"After living in fear of covid for over a year, I can’t turn that fear off in the span of a few press conferences.
I’m vaccinated, and will continue to wear a mask because we’re still going through a pandemic and variants keep cropping up. Numbers are up and down depending on where you live. In my county, they’re up.
I see the CDC’s guidance as premature and am waiting to see how the numbers roll out over the next few months."

The reason is, as stated by the CDC, this is an 'honor system'.  We're being asked to trust our fellow citizens to be honest about vaccinations.

If we've learned anything from the years of the Trump Administration it's that there is no 'honor' felt by many Americans.  

None."
2021-05-17 12:59,"My brother lives in Colorado  He has been fully vaccinated and continues to wear a mask.   He said one particular individual that he knows who doesn't wear a mask is always ""getting in my face when I encounter him.""  My brother said ""I don't know a lot of these people I encounter on a daily basis and I just don't trust them.""  I told him if he feels more comfortable wearing a mask then continue to wear one.  He agreed."
2021-05-17 12:59,"Ms. Cohen's comment reflects something I've thought about mask wearing since the Pandemic took hold: COVID-19 is far from the only virus or pathogen exhaled by others. There's colds, flus, etc, which also floats unseen in the air of enclosed spaces.

That said, having been fully vaccinated I'm still inclined to wear masks in places like stores and restaurants for now. The unvaccinated leave us still at risk of mutated COVID strains emerging in future. It seems prudent to err on the side of caution, more to proactively protect others than myself."
2021-05-17 13:00,"We re with others, we will continue to use the masks in the appropriate settings. This isn't over yet.... variants can still emerge, the unvaccinated could get sick from someone who is vaccinated and asymptomatic...too many variables at play. A harmless mask on one's face in a store or public area is a small sacrifice to continue making to protect us all. Get with the program, let's finish the job by getting more people vaccinated and wear masks until we do."
2021-05-17 13:00,"I became fully vaccinated in mid-February.  It took me at least two months (and also the info on the vaccines being effective against the known variants to date and that I’m highly unlikely to spread the vIrus) to realize I’d made it.  I’ll wear a mask in the grocery store or where asked, but I’ve come to accept the fact that I’m immune to this virus, regardless of any one else’s action."
2021-05-17 13:00,"All the adults in our family are fully vaccinated. Our two teens, one of whom is special needs and immunocompromised, got their first shots last Thursday. When they are both fully vaccinated (two weeks after their second shots), we will unmask according to CDC guidelines. Until then, all of us choose to err on the side of caution for the sake of our disabled child. People harassing others do not know what individual circumstances are and should assume good faith and practice charity."
2021-05-17 12:44,"I’ve been told my county is still at high risk with high rates of infection.  I have to get a booster in the fall.  When does the protection wane?  

Then there’s the impact of infection.  It costs nothing to wear a mask.  But the cost of getting Covid in human terms is high.

There used to be a famous physics teacher at Cal Tech who held class in a theater.  He would suspend an iron ball on a rope from the rafters.  He would bring the ball up to the chin of a volunteer and let go of the ball without any additional force.  The ball would swing the length of the stage and return just touching the volunteer on the chin.  “Faith in physics!” the instructor would exclaim.

I’m glad to be vaccinated.  But finding faith in vaccination, I’ve found, is something else…"
2021-05-17 11:39,It’s time to unite and return to normal. If you’re fully vaccinated wearing a mask sends the wrong message to society. If you’re at risk wear one. If you’re not vaccinated wear one. But if you are vaccinated and there’s no way to get it or transmit it then mask off. We have to get up and get on. Remove the politics. Listen to the science. Liberals can’t worship the CDC only when it’s convenient to their politics.
2021-05-17 13:01,"""I’m confused. Why should people care if someone wants to wear a mask outside?"" Dan Rather is right, but then the opposite should be true, too. Gail Collins in a column today calls her neighborhood ""public-spirited"" because people continue to wear masks in the streets. That, of course, means that people who do not wear masks after being vaccinated are... selfish? Or at least not public-spirited? I understand the trauma and the insecurity many people feel, but that should not dictate how they view others. Or, to paraphrase Rather: ""Why should people care if someone does not want to wear a mask outside?"""
2021-05-17 13:02,"I have not had so much as a sniffle since I started wearing a mask.  The proof is in the pudding.  No viruses, no infections, we get these from contact with infected others.  It is in the air.  When in public I will continue to wear my mask.  what others do is on them.  I can also choose not to be in a group of unmasked people.  I will not fly on an airplane if the mask requirement is lifted.  I too had respiratory issues after flying.  Nothing serious, just sinus discomfort or a cough."
2021-05-17 13:03,"We still have 33K + cases a day and about 600-700 deaths. This is the amount of death that we had before the election last year when we were pleading with everyone to wear masks and scolding the Trump administration.

I'm concerned this new policy will lead to more cases among the unvaccinated and unmasked.

I also think at the level of vaccination we have now the vaccinated will probably encounter the virus relatively often depending on your positivity level in your community and activities indoors. This may be just fine. I will be watching."
2021-05-17 13:05,"Count me in. I plan to mask-up until we know a lot more, like how long will one vaccination protect us? This won't be the last pandemic. Masks just make sense. Cheap. Easy. Effective."
2021-05-17 13:05,"Clearly people have a right to do what they want to do and they should not be made to feel uncomfortable with their choice.  However, as a county and community what unites us is our shard believes and connections.  The emotional response to seeing people has been under reported.  The smiles, the simple interactions or jokes in the check out line are much more important to keep us open to other people.  Masks work as a barrier to spontaneous interactions.  So, for this reason, I hope they do not last long."
2021-05-17 13:05,"We know the CDC was wrong. Did it really take the CDC 14 months to admit how this virus spreads? I am fully vaccinated. Masks on for me indefinitely. 
I realize messaging to the public is a complex process with many nuanced variables, including estimating how long the generally uninformed or Fox brainwashed public will sustain their interest. 
Some of us are interested in scientific method, accurate information and efficacy more than whether or not a safety protocol for oneself and others is convenient or not.  
Taking into account that we are apparently not uniting the world and instituting the Green New Deal to save our species and all other life on earth after all, new and ancient diseases .are. the new normal."
2021-05-17 13:06,"The very first maskless family get together that we had where all four  adults were fully vaccinated, my partner and I caught a miserable cold from the four year old who was present.  I completely understand people not wanting to give up their masks.  What I don't understand is why anyone else would care."
2021-05-17 13:06,"The pandemic has been as much a lesson about human behavior as it has been one about a highly infectious disease.

With every change in infectiousness, every ""hot-spot"" and ""drawdown, has come a swirl of competing ideologies for how people should think and behave.  So tribal, so human, so feral this impulse of anger and aggression towards people ""not like us.""

My sister almost died of Covid with a 106.5 fever, but she still has a fatalism about the disease and is ""waiting to see"" about the vaccine, so that's one approach.  

Some preachers, pastors and ministers want to fully open their churches.  Some are still Zoom only. 

Others assume everything is God's will so live dangerously without masks or vaccines, totally oblivious to the possibility that maybe it's God's will that they do wear masks and get vaccinated.

Others take a more pragmatic approach and just let things play out as they will.

At this point, I have resigned myself to the reality that the anti-maskers and anti-vaxxers will probably keep infecting the population at large indefinitely as will poor people and others who may not have as much access to PPE or vaccines.  

Covid is here to stay.  The virus won and spread all over the world.  The longer it goes on the, the more apparent it becomes that only a small number of nations with strong and unified nationwide efforts really were spared the disease.

So that's it.  Welcome to the new normal: masks, zealotry, death, sloganeering, vaccines, faith."
2021-05-17 13:06,"It's predictable that anti-anti-mask bullies are coming out in droves to enforce their view of the pandemic. I'm fully vaccinated. However, the vaccine isn't 100 percent effective. Until we know more about how long vaccine mediated immunity lasts and how effective the vaccines are against new variants, I'll continue to wear a mask in the subway, in stores, etc. I'd rather do what I can to decrease my risk, when wearing a mask is so easy. I'll reassess as more data become available."
2021-05-17 13:06,I seriously considered wearing a mask even before the pandemic just to avoid catching a cold or flu by random chance while out in the public. I'd seen other people wearing masks and it made sense to me. I'm fully vaccinated and I plan to continue wearing a mask while out and about.
2021-05-17 13:07,"I have worn masks for years because I am allergic to the chemicals (artificial fragrances) people soak their clothes, bodies, hair, deoderants etc in. These chemicals are unregulated, ubiquitous, and impossible to avoid in public settings. I welcome questions about my masking up and happily pull out my (fragrance free) soap box to (hopefully) educate people about the consequences their fragrance choices have for folks like me."
2021-05-17 13:07,I discovered that wearing the mask had an additional benefit.  I am allergic to tree pollen and this year I have not had the all out blast of runny eyes and bouts of sneezing that I have been getting for the past several years.  I have a bit of drippy nose while wearing the mask.  I will probably make mask wearing a habit in April and May from now on.
2021-05-17 13:07,"I will continue to wear my mask. And, yes, others have been telling me why i don’t have to wear it. Just respect my choice."
2021-05-17 13:07,"“I have no problem being one of the only people. But I don’t think I’m going to be the only one.”

That is precisely how my husband and I feel about the entire mask/no mask scenario.  While it took some getting used to early on, after 14 months, we ""have grown accustomed to the masks and glad for the extra safety they provide.""

Both my husband and I are in the senior and vintage category.  We've been pretty lucky and fortunate thus far, why tempt fate and suddenly act reckless, especially when only 36% of the country has been fully vaccinated.

People sneered and mocked us in the very beginning when we wore masks.  I even had someone cough directly into my face last April.  Frankly, the more push back we may receive, the more determined we are that we are making the right decision for US - to continue wearing masks.

At the very least, neither of us got colds or the flu this past winter.  If for no other reason, it's a great feeling that wearing these masks helped us remain healthy."
2021-05-17 13:07,"What a bizarre situation. People who refused to wear a mask, even though it was critical to protect others, cited personal freedom. But now when some want to continue masking, which puts NO one else at risk, the ""personal freedom"" crowd objects? On what possible grounds??"
2021-05-17 13:08,"I am surprised that we seeing the mask shaming behavior in the United States, the land of freedom. It’s nonsensical, but that puts it right in line with so much of the COVID-19 story line in America. So, maybe shouldn’t be surprised."
2021-05-17 13:08,"I’m fully vaccinated, and I’ve been following the science for a long time. The CDC is echoing what certain scientists and public health officials had been (more quietly) saying for months—like Monica Gandhi, for instance. I get the impression that the CDC so thoroughly terrified people with over-cautious messaging early on—in particular, the idea that you must still wear masks after vaccination—that now, many of the people who religiously cited the CDC’s mask guidance remain too nervous to follow the CDC’s new guidance. The CDC is to blame—it was over-cautious and instilled a disproportionate level of fear in people overall (not just in the genuinely risky situations, like indoors with no mask and no vaccination), flip-flopped, took too long to correct this, then pivoted suddenly to the opposite extreme, with little logistical guidance for businesses etc to navigate it all. 

Still, despite the CDC’s messaging mistakes, they’re right about the science, and I welcome being unmasked. But I fear that a sizable portion of people have lost all sense of risk proportion in their daily life and also have ironically chosen to wear “follow the science” labels but refuse to do so when they dislike the science, at which point it becomes political moralizing. I’m left-wing and support the right of people to mask, esp the immunocompromised. But the fact is that if you’re not at risk and are fully vaxxed, you’re very safe, and we need to relearn to live with risk. That’s just life, sadly."
2021-05-17 13:09,One added benefit was the added protection from the cold in the winter. Scarfs always seemed kind of fussy to me but the mask seems pretty effortless. Might keep using it next year even if Covid is more rare.
2021-05-17 13:09,"I don’t hear any complaints about people staying masked in NJ. What I’m experiencing is the unreasonable and intrusive demand that I, a fully vaccinated person who’s also tested negative twice, continue masking because of other people’s out of control fears. 

Sorry—but I went through the unpleasantness of vaccination and masking for over a year and I’m done. If u don’t trust others to get vaxxed, then nobody’s stopping YOU from continuing to mask for whatever reason. But leave me alone. I’m following the science, again. I masked when it wasn’t safe, now it IS safe for me, according to the CDC, so I will enjoy my new freedom."
2021-05-17 13:10,"Except for suffering psychological stress from fear of getting and dying of COVID, I have never felt more healthy in my life since the pandemic started. No strep throat, no cold or flu, no gastrointestinal illness triggered from something else. I used to get sick at least 3 times a year from encountering some floating virus from coworkers or the subway. I haven't needed to use any of my health care spending account and CVS pharmacy wonders what happened to me.

I'm perfectly comfortable wearing a mask even though I'll be fully vaccinated in another three weeks. I will continue to do so because no scientist can guarantee that a new variant might pop up one of these days that can evade all the vaccines. The CDC might be confident now but that can change in a heartbeat. If we let our guard down too soon, we might end up like India. No thanks."
2021-05-17 13:10,"Why is there backlash against people that still use the mask?  Don't people realize that the government has been either blatantly lying, about how bad things were, about the numbers, about how many people are getting vaccinated, about the numbers of people having reactions, nearly everything they tell us is suspect.  Chinese people have been wearing the masks for years (and all this time I thought it was to protect against other people's Halitosis), and the results of the non-existent flu epidemic this year, makes me think that I might continue with them also."
2021-05-17 13:11,"Long ago( at least fifty years)  I was impressed by photographs accompanying an article in a national news periodical of women who worked in a Tokyo department store wearing masks and wiping the handrail of the escalator as they greeted customers.  I thought how cool is that, to be courteous and considerate of others so as not to spread colds and the flu to others.
When the mask mandates were announced I thought, how civilized, how thoughtful we could be of others.  Then along came Trump and his Republican Sturmabteilung.  The mandate was adjusted to recognize a new reality.  Recognizing reality is not a Republican strong suit."
2021-05-17 13:13,"I'm fully vaccinated.  I've been ""unmasked"" outside and at a big box store which at the time was rather empty. I've eaten indoors at ""off"" times. I plan to continue in this manner. But there are times I will mask as well, especially during the couple weeks a year when my allergies act up, visiting an immune compromised friend; airplanes and crowded spaces ... when I at some point return to those."
2021-05-17 13:13,"Another long-term masker here. Although fully vaccinated since mid-April, my spouse and I do not plan to stop wearing masks in public any time soon. Our grandchildren are too young to be vaccinated and we simply are not willing to risk their health (or that of any young children)."
2021-05-17 13:14,"I'm fully vaccinated, and I think I'll continue wearing the mask for at least through next winter then I'll look at the numbers."
2021-05-17 13:15,"Everyone who wants to wear a mask should feel free to do so. Who is arguing against that? But, vaccinated people should likewise be allowed to go mask-free without being treated like a pariah.  The mask has essentially zero impact on a vaccinated person's ability to get or pass along covid. Check the science."
2021-05-17 13:18,"Most Americans are not yet fully vaccinated, a good chunk of adults don’t plan on having vaccines and we have barely started vaccinating children. There are many people who have poor immunity to disease, or who are fighting cancer or other serious illnesses. CDC is concerned with the herd of average people and the overall health of the population, not with individuals.  Wearing masks indoors when around those from other households is reasonable, and so is the consideration that all Americans are not equally healthy.  The fact that this is a debate exposes the sadly pervasive selfishness in the U.S. that let the virus run out of control in the first place."
2021-05-17 13:19,"I went to Trader Joe's yesterday with my wife.She asked store worker if we have to wear a mask and was told that not if we are immunized( we are both fully immunized since February).
We were the only people in the store NOT wearing a mask. Others looks at us with suspicion, but we didn't reciprocate.
I respect other people choices in this regard, but they should respect mine,after all I am following CDC recommendations and have a business owner permission."
2021-05-17 13:19,"Don’t like the foggy  glasses and don’t want to use throwaway N95’s. Vaccinated of course but my criteria to stop wearing them in stores is when the employees do, out of respect and thanks. Confident about the vaccine (not sure about longevity) based on what I’ve read."
2021-05-17 13:19,"I drove through western Kansas in early March when I was unvaccinated, as were most of the rest of the country. I always wore my mask at the time, and was especially concerned because my partner is at high risk and I had an elderly mom. When I would stop to get gas, I always wore my mask. 

I was shocked to have someone come up to me at the gas station and yell at me for wearing a mask. He yelled at me that there was no mask mandate in the county. He framed it as now being ""free"", and I should take it off.  I couldn't believe it for two reasons. One, if we are now free, why can't I wear a mask? Why is it his business. Second, people were dying at very high rates at the time, so it was frankly shocking to me that someone was trying to convince someone else not to wear a mask.

I told this freedom lover who wanted to tell me exactly what I could and couldn't wear that my mom was in her 90s, and I wished everyone would wear a mask to help keep her safe until vaccines were more available.  He then calmed down, and said, ""Oh, I get it, my wife works in a nursing home.""  

Talk about NOT getting it.

I'm vaccinated now as are my loved ones. I don't wear my mask outside and gather with other vaccinated friends without masks. But I will keep wearing a mask in the store until we get closer to 70% vaccination rate. And likely always will on the airplane.  And I will avoid western Kansas.  It's a free country, right?"
2021-05-17 13:19,"I just went through a full year without a cold and with massively reduced allergies…thanks to masking up everywhere. If that’s what it takes to sustain a reduction of risks to my general well being, I might just keep doing it. Besides, with CoVID19 variants circulating and poor vaccine uptake…we’re not out of the woods yet."
2021-05-17 13:19,"I have an alternate interpretation of the mask holdouts. For those who have defended them so vigorously all year, it's a matter of pride to not give in. They don't want to give a perceived win to the anti maskers, to give them the satisfaction and vindication that non mask wearing ultimately triumphs as people throw away the masks. The mask holdouts like those featured in the article remind me of the Japanese soldiers who refused to surrender after WWII, and continued to 'fight on' futiley on some island for years to come. It is for them a point of pride."
2021-05-17 13:20,"Not being a psychologist, I cannot understand the compulsion Covid deniers and anti-vaxxers have to not only ignore public health advice and vaccine efficacy for themselves, but to try to enforce their views on others. Some will go so far as near-assault; ripping off masks, blocking access to vaccine clinics, and so on.
Seriously: What is wrong with these people??"
2021-05-17 13:20,"Dan Rather is right to ask; ""Why should people care if someone wants to wear a mask outside?""

The answer is because they don't believe in science and social responsibility."
2021-05-17 13:20,"It’s wrong to act like there are no consequences to continuing to mask. My 2 year old who has lived most of his life in this pandemic is having trouble learning new worlds and learning to detect emotions since all the faces he sees are masked. I’m generally a “to each their own” kind of person but everything does have externalities. And after the maskers threw such outbursts at people, such as those running mask-less outside, even when the science conclusively showed that was harmless, I totally understand why the over paranoid are getting some side eye here."
2021-05-17 13:20,"For the foreseeable future, I plan to mask up in public. Not so much out of fear of Covid (I'm fully vaccinated, yay!) but because I would be horrified to be mistaken for an anti-masker."
2021-05-17 13:21,"My husband, teen daughter, and I got our second jabs yesterday and are counting down the days until we're fully vaccinated. On the day she's cleared to unmask, she will gleefully do so and is already planning a get together with her fully vaccinated friends. I'm so excited for her to be able to enjoy the summer, because who knows what fall will bring. 

I don't care if anyone else wants to keep wearing their masks for eternity, but after 14 months of this I am ready to just enjoy one season of relative freedom. The ones who should be the most worried are those who refuse to get a shot (and they're not)."
2021-05-17 13:21,We must follow the lead of many Asian countries and continue masking up during cold and flu season. This would save so many lives and help to prevent the spread of the annoying flu virus that nobody wants. I have no problem wearing a mask from October - March when I'm going into a store or on public transit.
2021-05-17 13:21,"This past weekend, a friend and I were accosted while walking outdoors with our young children who were wearing masks. The person screamed at us (and our kids!) about the masks and said some pretty horrible things. It was deeply upsetting and hard to explain to the kindergarteners why an adult would behave like that."
2021-05-17 13:23,"There's caution and then there's negative fantasy, paranoia, the other side of the same coin as Covid-denial. Being vaccinated doesn't promise 100% protection, but we are not 100% protected from getting in car accidents, crashing in a plane, getting hit by a car, etc. The logic of wearing two masks and goggle for the next five years also says one should probably not leave the house. Ever. I urge people to seek therapy to help mitigate the trauma of the past 15 months and to help live in reality."
2021-05-17 13:23,"I am fully vaccinated. Masks on for me indefinitely. When I lived in Japan, we all wore masks as soon as they felt a cold coming on. It’s what civilized people do for each other. 

Taking into account that we are apparently not pushing Biden to unite the world and institute the Green New Deal to save our species and all other life on earth, new and ancient diseases .are. the new normal. Along with increased uninhabitable locations, increased catastrophic fires and hurricanes…"
2021-05-17 13:23,"I’m fully vaccinated and carry a mask on my daily walk. If I approach someone wearing a mask, I put mine on. How hard is it to make others feel comfortable?"
2021-05-17 13:25,"As a solid organ transplant recipient who takes medication to suppress my immune system, I will have to wear a mask until further notice because the medicine prevents the vaccine from working."
2021-05-17 13:25,"A backlash against people who refused to wear masks made sense: they were putting others at risk. It they’re currently unvaccinated, they still are. A backlash against people who want to continue wearing masks makes no sense: they’re not harming anyone. If it gives them greater peace of mind and they’re not demanding the same behavior from other vaccinated people, what’s the issue? Those of us who are vaccinated can now choose masked or unmasked, within CDC and local guidelines, with a clear conscience."
2021-05-17 13:25,"We are quickly approaching a half a BILLION people worldwide who are fully vaccinated and here is what we now know for a fact:

If you are fully vaccinated your chances of even contracting the virus (including all known variants) is very low and even if you do catch it your chances of serious illness are right up there with getting struck by lightening and your chances of spreading the virus even lower than that. 

The new CDC Guidance is not ""premature"" or ""confusing"" at all. Nor does it mean private businesses will need to be the vaccine police.

It's very simple. If you are vaccinated you are close enough to 100% protected to make no never mind against both catching and transmitting Covid.

If you are not vaccinated but choose to not wear a mask you risk yourself and other vaccine refusers only. 

The ""still waiting for a vaccine"" crowd can just wear a mask until they get their vaccine.

As to mutations so far that hasn't been an issue and we already have boosters in the works they can update in nearly real time if that becomes a problem.

So again the vaccinated will remain protected and the non vaccinated pretending to be vaccinated and not wearing a mask simply risk themselves and the anti vaccine community.

In the end the Darwinian nature of this new CDC Guideline regarding masks may well be the best solution to the anti vaccine folks.

Either they die or develop natural immunity without risking everyone else."
2021-05-17 13:25,"Masks had an unintended benefit for my friend. After discovering a sore that wouldn’t heal near his nose, he was diagnosed with basal cell skin cancer. The mask covered his bandages and then protected him from the sun as he was healing. 

Wear a mask, and you can skip the sunscreen (or hide the damage of a lack of sunscreen earlier in life)!"
2021-05-17 13:27,"I’m fully vaccinated and will continue to wear a mask indoors when I’m around people I don’t know like at the grocery store. Here in Michigan we have so many antimaskers and antivaxxers that we’ve had the most cases of Covid in the country for the last couple of months. I don’t trust anyone here because I know that these fine folks have stopped wearing masks entirely since Friday. 

If anyone dares to harass me, they will be very sorry."
2021-05-17 13:28,"I had the flu a couple years ago when I need a medical procedure. I wore a mask to protect the doctor and nurses, and all of them let me know their appreciation. I'm not optimistic we'll reach herd immunity in the US because too many Americans bought into a Middle Age contempt of science, so I'll continue to wear a mask in public."
2021-05-17 13:28,"Although I live where masking has always been quite common throughout cold and flu season, I never followed suit until January 2020. 

But now that I’ve largely lived my normal life except haven’t even had so much as a sniffle since 2019, I’m a convert and plan to continue masking whenever I’m in close contact with others, and I’m happy to live where nobody will give me a second look for doing so."
2021-05-17 13:28,"I don't care what the CDC says. I think they're using it as a ploy so more people get vaccinated. Personally I still think it's too risky for me to not wear my mask.  I plan on wearing it at least through next winter, so maybe in a year I might take it off. I don't understand why people think me wearing a mask is their business, why they think it concerns them. I for one didn't get vaccinated so I could go mask free. I got vaccinated as an extra precaution to go along with my mask and social distancing. When I feel the time is right, I will take it off but this is not that time. It's still out there, and not enough people are vaccinated."
2021-05-17 13:29,"Absolutely, people should do as they feel is right and safe. But it’s not exactly honest to say “Why should people care if someone wants to wear a mask outside?” when wearing a mask has become symbolic of a whole set of social and political beliefs. Like it or not, it’s a statement."
2021-05-17 13:30,"I branch out more, however, I’m going to continue to wear my mask so my grandchildren, who are under the age to be vaccinated, are protected!"
2021-05-17 13:30,"I will continue to wear my mask through the end of the year and reevaluate. The biggest thing is we don’t know who is and is not vaccinated. I think it is the very least I can do to keep myself and my community safe. I know one lady at my local grocery store check out has an immunocompromised parent at home, and kids too young to be vaccinated.
If the smallest thing I can do is wear a mask, why wouldn’t I?

I am an American and moved back to the US after many years in New Zealand.  One of the biggest things I can’t seem to understand is why so many Americans feel it is acceptable and appropriate to publicly comment on other people’s choices. (I find this is far more common in the Northeast.) Masking is a perfect example of this- a mask doesn’t hurt anyone. Why comment and shame folks that choose to continue to mask? If it’s not hurting anyone, who cares?"
2021-05-17 13:31,"From my observations, in Brooklyn and Manhattan, people have been pretty-much universally cool with mask wearing for this past year. I had one instance, back in April 2020, where I asked a guy to mask-up in the grocery, and he complied without conflict, and even apologized. I have yet to witness this rash of incivility over mask wearing... are we just nicer and more reasonable here in Fun City (mild jest, but really, what is up with the rest of the country?)"
2021-05-17 13:31,"After my transplant I started wearing masks when flying because I kept getting sick after each flight. I also sanitized my tray table, and anything else in my seat area that I might touch during the flight. I also sanitized every frequently touched spot in my hotel rooms. I got some looks on the plane occasionally but generally ignored them. 

One day a man sitting next to me on the plane asked if the mask was to protect me from him or him from me. I replied ""why does it matter?"" and left it at that."
2021-05-17 13:32,"I used to get at least 1 bad cold a year. Some years, I had two bouts of the cold or the flu. Some of those experiences truly felt miserable. In 2009, I had the H1N1 in another pandemic, albeit much smaller in magnitude than this present one. It was a miracle I did not die. Since wearing the mask in March 2020, I have not had any of these miseries. The last bad cold I had was in November 2019. I will be wearing a mask in perpetuity at least in crowded places such as subways and public places where people are packed together."
2021-05-17 12:50,"If someone wants to keep wearing a mask (or a silly hat for that matter), I can't see why anyone else should have a problem with that.  And one could make a reasonable argument that because some unvaccinated people can't be trusted, mask mandates should remain in place. However, without such regulations, for someone that is fully vaccinated and thus in no undue danger or a threat to others from the virus, how does them continuing to wear a mask help anyone?"
2021-05-17 13:21,"When I was much younger, people complained when I wore the the clothes I wanted and let my hair grow longer. Now people complain when I still want to wear a mask. Why are Americans so concerned with how their neighbor looks or dresses?"
2021-05-17 13:18,"Wearing a mask outside while walking alone or with your partner just seems weird. It’s unnecessary, kind of like using an umbrella when it isn’t raining."
2021-05-17 13:34,The whole idea about the lock down and mandates is to keep the hospitals from getting over crowded. That threat has been gone for along time now. Now it is all just politics. Democrats and republicans differ on so many things. Who would have thought it would be masks too. And it isn’t the citizens wearing the masks that are facing criticism. It is the state governments that have been telling all that they are following the science telling all to wear a mask. Now that the same science says it is okay to not wear the mask the same states refuse to follow the science. And this is totally blue states red states. The blue state democrats just enjoy watching the republicans wear masks. It is down to this now.
2021-05-17 12:55,"at least do yourself a favor and take it off outside, and breathe some fresh air.
i would think that if we stop all the kindergardners from getting sick many will grow up with debilitating allergies ir even auto-immune diseases— the early years, and the constant exploration of the world by putting everything in your mouth, trains the immune system. That’s the hygiene theory which is pretty well established. 
it’s one thing for an adult off his rocker to mask for five years, another to impose it on a child— they will never learn social cues either and their emotional development will be stunted."
2021-05-17 13:35,"It is interesting, isn't it that the use of a properly designed and fitted mask has been to protect others from ourselves, with some protection from the density of virus particles from others. 
 
I find it odd that people believe they cannot read expression except through someone's mouth. I read through all facial and body expression, including match and mismatch of shoulders, forehead, hands, legs,  overall posture, eyes, and quality of speech or gestures. That has always been so, not limited to ""training"" and 40 years' professional practice as a mental health clinician. Never rely on a smile, frown or mouth to relay how someone ""is.""  

If you want to understand emotional and thought expression, watch a ballet, watch figure skating freestyle performances, listen to classical orchestral music or skilled soloist singers.

From infancy we learn to use the mouth as a mask for social greetings and exchanges. It has little to do with what we feel or intend.  If you are not matching your smile with your eyes or body gestures, then it means nothing more than a pair of reflective sunglasses where humanity is successfully hidden.

I wear a mask when near others to protect them and myself, even with full vaccination, and will do so for some months in the future. What we do not know is a quantum leap greater than what we do know, much as I appreciate the enormity of scientific and evidence based information we now have.

With respect,
A still breathing and working human"
2021-05-17 13:36,"I have a number of female friends who have told me how much more relaxed they are not having to deal with catcalls as much, told to “smile more”,
Etc.. For them, they’ve said they plan to stay masked, maybe forever.

As a man, I don’t have that reason, but I honestly really enjoy wearing a mask or bandana when out or in stores.

I actually hike a lot and have discovered I inhale fewer bugs.  My cousin has a young son who, despite not being required to, plays high-level competitive soccer with a mask.  His coach said they aren’t required, but the kid just says he’s more comfortable with it and that his allergies are better.

Anyway - if people want to leave them on, possibly forever, more power to them!"
2021-05-17 13:36,"I’m fully vaccinated, but out of respect for others, will continue wearing a mask when around public places. Where I don’t wear one is on my daily 15 mile bike ride on our country roads, enjoying unmasked freedom. I do however always keep one in my handlebar bag and whip it on as needed. BTW, I’ve not had even a sniffle in the past 15 months. That alone makes mask wearing worth it."
2021-05-17 13:36,"I'm in my 60s and fully vaccinated.  At the moment, indoor mask measures are still in place in New Jersey.  When they are lifted, I plan on carrying one with me at all times and slip it on depending on the circumstances.

Outdoors: Leave it off.  The exception would be if I'm in a crowd with people shouting or singing and no social distancing possible.  

Restaurants:  Follow whatever rules are in place.  It does seem a little silly to sit without your mask and put it on to go to the restroom but it's not worth it to act like a jerk to some poor waitress who tries to enforce the rules.

Gym:  My gym is very well ventilated and they check temperatures at the door.  Running on a treadmill with a mask is uncomfortable so I'd really like to ditch it if I can at least for aerobic exercise.  Put it on if it's crowded or when doing weights.

Stores:  Most of the stores I go to are not all that well ventilated.  Wear the mask especially if it's crowded.  

Theaters:  Wear the mask.

Public Transport:  Wear the mask.

Above all I want to focus on being kind and non-judgmental with others.  That person sporting the full double mask and face shield in the grocery store parking may have an exaggerated fear of the virus or he may have a valid medical reason for doing so.  If someone asks me to wear a mask outdoors (as my horse vet recently did) I'll say ""sure, no problem"" and put it on."
2021-05-17 13:36,"I've stopped wearing gloves, but I'm still wearing a mask and hand washing. Although I'm fully vaccinated, I intend to keep up this protocol until -I- feel comfortable with vaccination levels in my community."
2021-05-17 13:37,"Those who choose not to wear a mask are playing roulette with their own health - not mine.  I'll be part of the ""herd' with fewer worries.  In crowded places, I still wear a mask because it occurred to me, I haven't had even a slight cold in a year. How nice that's been. Why would I want bronchitis to prove a point?"
2021-05-17 13:37,I'm going to defer to the CDC on this one. I'm fully vaccinated. There is no reason to wear a mask anymore.
2021-05-17 13:37,"When I continue to wear a mask as a fully vaccinated adult, I am standing with the people who have individual medical conditions for which a mask offers important safety. They should be allowed to wear a mask if they want without pressure from anyone to do otherwise. Until then, I will stand with them. 

Every time someone criticizes me, I say, ""Just as I do not know anything about your health, you know nothing about mine. 

In 2021, it's high time we build a culture of respect for individual rights. We can do this one encounter at a time. For a year now, we wore masks to fight a deadly disease. Now we can wear them to root out something just as destructive: a culture of disregard for my right to care for my body as I please."
2021-05-17 13:37,"Millions are immunocompromised from autoimmune disease therapy, cancer therapy, transplant survivors, and probably other conditions I’m unaware of.

Reports are that many have not built antibodies after vaccination.

You can’t tell by looking whether someone has immune system problems. 

Many are of working age, continue to work; disability is not an option unless you truly cannot function.

I wish someone, the CDC, Dr. Fauci, someone would educate the public about these points."
2021-05-17 13:02,"The lazy use of the word ""forever"" to cast people who are currently choosing to be more careful than the speaker as unreasonable has been occurring since the beginning of the pandemic. Not everyone in the U.S. has access to vaccines yet."
2021-05-17 13:37,"My husband came home from work yesterday (his workplace has not lifted its face covering requirement for employees yet) and said a customer, who was not wearing a mask, randomly walked up to him and proclaimed ""I've been vaccinated!"" to which he said he responded ""so have I."" 

As soon as his employer drops the face covering requirement for employees he won't wear one. But he won't be announcing he's been vaccinated, either. 

Get vaccinated, or don't. Wear a mask, or don't. I think we can all agree we should be kind and respectful of each choice."
2021-05-17 13:38,"I completely understand their feelings.  I'll continue to wear a mask and gloves in the subway for years to come.  Outside isn't necessary unless I'm in a serious crowd that is stationery.  

And yes, it does afford a sense of anonymity.  On the way to work, I frequently talk to myself as I think about my day ahead.  Didn't realize that people were staring at me until I took the mask off."
2021-05-17 13:30,I find it ironic that so many worried about their freedom and being tracked don't see the benefit of a mask coupled with a big pair of sunglasses. Primary points of facial recognition are covered.
2021-05-17 13:38,"Disease and identity. Our culture is one where identity begins at birth -- you are who we say you are -- regardless of what is real, regardless of roles we are expected to play, and when you are on a public stage of simply being in public, you will pay a price for those moments of political wrangling. Politics is its own god, and the awareness that you, too, are your own god, and not obligated to follow the herd over the cliff. I drive a dirt bike. I wear a mask, and motorcycle helmet. You do not know who I am because I am not accessible to you from the other side of the face shield. Anonymity is liberation. When your second selves step outside of imposed roles (worker, mom, dad), where you are validated for following rules that are arcane, nonsensical, degrading, humiliating, and exploitive, you nevertheless cannot find the words to articulate our tentative hold on who we are, what we are allowed to say, to write, we are what we drive, we are what we post to instagram (imagine 5 billion people, and none of them are who they say they are) we are a mysteriousness, we are embedded in what we wear.  To wear a mask is to pull the rug out from other human beings who do not understand, and never will, that there are those among us who are what we say we are. We are not the suits, the punishment police whose job is to shut us up, and I am told fingerprints are unique. Not true. If I chose to wear a mask, and I do, I am pitted not against other Homo sapiens, but against death."
2021-05-17 13:38,I don't care if people mask or not. I just don't want masking up during regular flu season (or during the entire winter!) to turn into a socially-mandated thing where a person not masking will be given the side-eye.
2021-05-17 13:01,"Hmmm, he has worn two masks and googles every time he has left his house and STILL GOT COVID. We’re not anti-mask or anti-vaccine but even I have to say that it doesn’t seem like his extreme level of “protection,” didn’t actually provide any protection."
2021-05-17 13:39,"I think this article doesn’t really mention how certain folks masking up despite the guidance suggesting it would be safe to stop are the same ones who, in some areas, were exceptionally vocal about mask use. Briefly checking one’s mailbox without a mask -= “Trump supporter!” Our local Nextdoor was filled with folks calling masked runners on the sidewalk murderers, as a bandana couldn’t be enough to stop their heavy breathing of Covid on everyone. The culture around here has been that you are entirely against the community of you don’t have a mask on or your mask isn’t up to your neighbor’s standards.

For those of us who are vaccinated and feel safe, we’d very much love for fewer folks to wear masks when not needed to help end culture of finger pointing and required social signalling - despite the science saying outdoor transmission is highly highly unlikely. But unlike my lovely neighbors, I won’t be yelling my displeasure about masks on or off: I’ll mind my business."
2021-05-17 13:39,"I’m a physician in NY who contracted COVID in March of 2020. I’m also fully vaccinated. I wear my mask indoors still but I’ve lately started keeping it off when I’m outside and not in a crowded area. Since having COVID, I haven’t had the flu or even a cold since, and I used to get them all the time. That’s in large part because everyone else was also wearing a mask, but I’m willing to continue wearing a mask on the subway or anywhere crowded indoors for as long as o can get away with it."
2021-05-17 13:40,"Free speech--wear a mask if it makes  you feel better, or don't wear a mask.  Both are the correct response.

Like I said--free speech.  Everybody has the right to decide how they're going to move through society, period."
2021-05-17 13:40,Fully vaccinated and am loving my walks outside mask free. It was 12 months of religiously wearing my mask outdoors in my busy urban neighborhood. Intention was to protect myself and others. Now I plan to just wear it at public indoor locations for the foreseeable future based on the national vaccination rate. It's a minimal inconvenience. When cold/ flu season comes around my mask will come in handy on mass transit commutes!
2021-05-17 13:40,"There is more bad stuff in the air than just the Covid-19 virus.  There will always be variants that will sneak around our feeble screening and testing.  Also, there is pollen Spring and Fall.  In Winter, there is the dust from the stuff put on roads for ice. There are always people with non-Covid diseases.  And year around, our air is getting more and more polluted. 

Our bodies will thank us for continuing to help protect them."
2021-05-17 13:40,"I am fully vaccinated, and feel very comfortable with being around people, however, I still wear a mask because almost every business requires one, no big deal I put one on. I agree with another poster that the vaccinated should just get back to normal life and the unvaccinated wafflers, and the anti-vaxxers just take their chances,  Good luck getting on a cruise ship without your vaccine card or traveling internationally."
2021-05-17 13:41,"I'm the opposite. I crave connection and freedom more than I crave safety. The uber-cautious crowd has called the shots for over a year. I say it's time for the ""reasonable risk"" people to have our moment in the sub."
2021-05-17 13:41,"My 8 year old is unvaccinated, of course, and will probably remain so until sometime early next year when vaccines are approved for young children.

I’m vaccinated, so technically I don’t need to wear one. But am I really going to refuse to wear one in public when my 8 year old has to? I plan to set a good example."
2021-05-17 13:41,"I'm vaccinated but will continue to mask indoors while food shopping and will limit what I do indoors outside my home for the foreseeable future. As with most major diseases, the medical experts know only so much about covid, and I'm sure they will be gaining new understanding of it for a long time to come. Add the fact that some people won't get vaccinated, many people wear flimsy masks below their nose and wear masks with beards, and I have an immune risk, and I will continue to minimize risk. The County where I live is still described as a high risk area, people continue to be hospitalized and die of covid, although reduced, and I don't want to be one of them; I'll relax when the numbers are near zero."
2021-05-17 13:42,"Think about this: the longer Joe goes masked, the more resistance he will lose to common bugs we all see all the time. Beware the rebound. 
Masking and distancing, used 100 years ago, are effective. Sadly, something about our society transmogrified a logical discussion of these actions into either the political or emotional realms. The result is that neither was well explained at the outset, they were just crammed down and reactions turned into overreactions. The people are inherently (collectively) savvy, and had they trusted our government more they might have gone along with the program better. Then they closed beaches and parks, clearly an act of desperation and not logic. 
People would have mostly stayed away from sick people; that’s a built in behavior. Couple that with skepticism relating to actual low death rates among those under 50, you have a population of 221 million folks who see, from actual experience, COVID as pretty much like the flu. To restate: 2/3 of the country had 4.7% of the deaths, and if you take out comorbidities like heart disease and diabetes, covid deaths for them were miniscule. The People in those age ranges see lots of cases, true, but few die. Conclusion: this ain’t that bad, hence, the antimasking. A bad conclusion, but not wrong. Masking during an actual crisis is logical; during a faux crisis, no. 
The same buffleheads that warned the sky was falling (it didn’t) are saying, de-mask. Ah gee, what are we to believe?"
2021-05-17 13:42,"I wish the mask guidance was a bit more nuanced to take care of our little residents kids under 12 years of age. As a fully vaccinated parent of a 4 year old, I know fully well that my kid has low risk, but I still don't want the kid to catch this virus and bring it home. The only way for me to get that across to the kid is for ME/MY SPOUSE to continue to model mask wearing. These anti-masking enthusiasts need to be respectful of these realities that make parents like me make these choices. More importantly governments need to recognize this reality and message the public appropriately. Otherwise, I am signing up for unnecessarily hostile interactions at public places."
2021-05-17 13:44,"Unvaccinated people are not exempt from wearing masks. But now they will systematically get away with not wearing them.  It was a mistake to relax the federal recommendations on masking  so soon. The ability to not wear a mask will not motivate anti-vaxxers to get vaccinated, it will just encourage them not to wear a mask."
2021-05-17 13:45,"I'm double vaccinated with Pfizer.  Like millions of other immunocompromised people (see NYTimes article, ""Vaccines Won't Protect Millions of Patients with Weakened Immune Systems), I had a weak (albeit technically positive) response.  Specifically, my response was 60 times lower than those who had a robust response.  With less than half of the U.S. population responsibly vaccinated, not masking is neither a rational nor a responsible option.  Thanks largely to anti-vaxers, it probably never will be.  Ironically, the ignorant people most likely to sneer at my mask are the ones making it an unending necessity."
2021-05-17 13:46,"My concern is that people who are fully vaccinated will continue to be overly cautious. This undermines vaccination efforts by making them look ineffective, increasing vaccine hesitancy. Why bother getting it if you’re still isolating at home and double masking? 

This is the other side of the coin when it comes to politicizing covid precautions."
2021-05-17 13:46,"I’m fully vaccinated and feel most comfortable indoors with a mask on. Secondly, my allergies have been barely noticeable."
2021-05-17 13:46,"The belief that masks are now unnecessary scares me. I wish I shared the confidence of those who are tossing their masks out, but I will be keeping mine on, probably for a few years."
2021-05-17 13:13,"I have no idea who has been fully vaccinated and who has not.  It is because of that uncertainty that my husband and I will remain wearing face masks indefinitely.

Funny how the non-maskers were clamoring for people to respect their right to not wear a mask when the pandemic was at it's many peaks throughout the past 14 months.

Why can't those same knuckleheads give those who wish to remain mask wearers offer the same degree of respect?"
2021-05-17 13:46,"I'm 60, and I DEFINITELY don't care what anyone thinks of me. Particularly those I don't know. I haven't had so much as a cold- in 15 months! I'll be buying masks till my time is up. Plus exercise, good food, zinc, vit d3...any immune booster I can think of."
2021-05-17 13:29,In one sense I'm actually looking forward to the next 3 months. We know that nearly all unvaccinated people are going to go maskless. We might assume that perhaps 50% of vaccinated people will stay masked. A conspiratorially minded person might think the CDC is purposely running an experiment to see where and how fast and with which variants the virus spreads.
2021-05-17 13:48,"I will be perfectly honest. How often have we observed globally the virus go down , masks off only a few weeks or months later watch the covid virus return ? I have an immunosuppresed grown daughter and a too young for immunization grandson living with me. My adult son also suffered as a child from a pediatric kidney disease an autoimmune disease.Between both my adult children and their compromised immune system I’ve spent years in hospital with them getting treatment. With that medical history I’ve spent over a year distance learning my grandson specifically because children rarely but do get MIC-S a rare pediatric autoimmune disease.  
Am I over reacting? I really couldn’t say but I’ve experienced autoimmune disease in my children and want to if I possibly can protect my grandson. So we all will mask up out in public and wait to see."
2021-05-17 13:48,"I’ll keep wearing masks in crowded settings, especially the subway. I’m not about to interview people around me on their vaccination status, nor am I inclined to imagine that every maskless person I come in contact with is trustworthy on that point. 

Further, I’m feeling great disappointment with the CDC. I’ve read that they are no longer tracking reports of covid in vaccinated people unless they result in hospitalization or death. To me this is a misleading and willfully incomplete picture and too low a bar for me to feel safe about giving up masks, especially given the known repercussions of “mild” covid. Are they selling the vaccine so hard that they can’t acknowledge its reasonable limitations? 

I also now realize that masks are generally useful, especially for older people like me. That hadn’t occurred to me before the pandemic. I got the worst cold of my life on the New York subway from a little boy sitting near me who appeared feverish and miserable and was flagrantly coughing and sneezing. I hadn’t noticed him until it was too late. Perhaps a mask would have at least limited the degree of my exposure? I know I’ll never be without one again."
2021-05-17 13:48,"I'll continue to wear my mask, for a long time, if possible.  It does not bother me.  It protects me from other peoples germs, and protects others from me. I also like the advantage/benefit it provides against face recognition and surveillance by various government and other institutions (better with a big hat and dark glasses)."
2021-05-17 13:47,"I'm fully vaccinated but I'll keep wearing a mask inside stores and large gatherings of people. Until we see the full effect of the vaccine play out for a year I'll keep wearing it, too many unvaccinated people which will lead to more obvious mutations of the COVID virus."
2021-05-17 13:48,"My son, with some health issues, was just eligible to be vaccinated per the 12-15 approval, so he won't be immune until mid-June.  With everyone tossing their masks, it's going to be harder to keep him safe.  I'm not going to stop wearing a mask and will now have to be even extra careful so as not to bring it home until then.  There are break-through cases in the vaccinated, so I could carry it even if I don't get sick.  I passed by a restaurant Saturday night, packed to the brim, and not one mask in sight.  It's not believable to think every person in that place was vaccinated."
2021-05-17 13:49,"The CDC guidance is premature as we still don’t have a reasonable number of people vaccinated.

The anti-vaxxers, who are largely also anti-maskers, will simply not wear masks. And those of us who are vaccinated but who choose to wear masks in certain situations, or during cold/flu season, will be treated badly (either because people will think we are not yet vaccinated OR simply because seeing someone in a mask makes them angry)

Why set a rule that seems to favor the anti-vaccine/anti-mask crowd?"
2021-05-17 13:32,"Frankly, I believe the C.D.C. had gotten it wrong and backwards from the very beginning.  At first, they did not strongly urge nor recommend the wearing of face masks (until the pandemic was well out of control), just like now - with just 1/3 of the country completely vaccinated, they now state that the wearing of masks is not needed except for certain scenarios.

My husband and I will continue to do what we think is best and the safest for us.  People can mock if they will, I don't care.  What they don't see is me sticking my tongue out at them, in disgust, behind a masked face."
2021-05-17 13:50,"I am a vaccinated 72 year old.  I was one of the few people who wore a mask when flying during the Sars outbreak years ago.  I have been wearing a mask whenever indoors in a publicly accessible building since February of last year.  I also wore a mask when outdoors in public until I was vaccinated.

I will continue to wear a mask whenever indoors in stores and other buildings at least until this virus is rare.  I see no downside whatsoever since wearing a mask for the past 15 months resulted in my avoiding infection from this virus.  Not only that, but during these 2 winters I have also avoided other less severe infections which previously I usually suffered from about once per winter.

The CDC's latest dictum is a disservice to the public.  As great as these vaccines are, none are 100% effective.  The people most likely now to go mask-less are not vaccinated people.  The people most likely to go mask-less are the great many people who are opposed to vaccination and resent requirements to wear masks.  They will now be close by among us spreading their infections."
2021-05-17 13:50,"My suspicion is some vaccinated people will continue to wear masks while many vax-refusers will stop wearing masks.  As such, continuing to wear a mask seems reasonable and prudent."
2021-05-17 13:50,"I don't care if someone wants to wear a mask forever. Not at all. But I don't want such fearful people influencing local businesses and government to the point that others have to wear masks.

I've faithfully obeyed social distancing and mask-wearing rules throughout the pandemic. I never had any sympathy for the selfish never-wear-a-mask types. But safetyism cannot be allowed to govern our society. The cost will be too great. Life's for living and fortune favors the brave."
2021-05-17 11:22,"Best quote: “Kindergartners, while adorable, are quick to share their secretions,...”"
2021-05-17 13:51,"I'm fully vaccinated and plan to keep wearing a mask in public. I haven't had a cold for over a year now since wearing a mask which for me is remarkable.  I used to get at least 2 miserable colds a year.  I also suffer from seasonal allergies and have seen a marked reduction in symptoms also since wearing the mask.  That being said, I certainly do not trust a certain element of society to be honest about their vaccination status. If someone asked me to show proof, I would have no issue bringing up the copy of  my vaccination card I have on my phone.  But I doubt retailers will be asking for proof and I want to be in a situation where I might be in the presence of a person who might be shedding the disease.  The vaccines aren't 100% effective and I just don't want to take a chance of exposure or possible re-transmission no matter how slim the odds. I expect there will be plenty of people who lie about their vaccine status to shed the mask"
2021-05-17 13:52,"I plan on continuing to wear masks until we know our vaccines are effective against variants and herd immunity is reached. Also, although I am fully vaccinated, others have no way of knowing that. I think people will feel safer coming into contact with me if I’m masked. I say this especially since I have asthma and am prone to coughing."
2021-05-17 13:53,I’ve been good. I got my vaccine. Where appropriate I will no longer where a mask. I will carry one and if someone asks me to I will happily put it on while interacting with them or according to a businesses policy. BUT I’m moving on with my life. If we don’t have heard immunity that’s not my fault.
2021-05-17 13:53,"I’m a great fan of medicine and vaccines, and masks have been invaluable while we searched for both. But the substitute teacher’s observation about it being better for the kindergartners not to put fingers in their mouths of catch colds does not accord with the idea that childhood exposure to many illnesses builds the innate immunity that can decrease illness severity later in life.
Or the claims that lack of exposure to bacteria in childhood can lead to severe allergies and auto immune problems.
I’ve read that our lack of exposure to influenza this year has some experts worried about a super flu season due to the evolutionary pressure we’ve created.
It seems likely that we must, in some cases, encounter a little misery from nature in order to spare ourselves worse..."
2021-05-17 13:54,"Last night at 10:30 I walked from my senior housing apt (I am 74 years of age) to the 7/11. The place was packed with young people. Every single one of them was wearing a mask. On the street while walking my dog, people are still wearing masks. Perhaps those with immunity problems should wear masks anyway. But until a higher percentage of our population gets the vaccine, it would be prudent to wear one. A note: back in January when CVS was notified to start immunizing people, a bunch of medical professionals came into our senior housing like storm troopers! After the shot we were dispatched to a well spaced community area for 15 minutes in case of any reactions. In silence we sat there. Then ever so quietly came an overwhelming reaction. It was sighs of relief (and gratitude to CVS and those responsible here in Waltham, Mass)"
2021-05-17 11:26,"Now and for the forseeable future I will mask up whenever I go indoors.  We visited the Bronx Zoo last week and everybody was masked up outside.  (A mask really improved our visit indoors at Jungle World too!!!! You know why... lol) 

 Like many others, I do not want to spread any germs to anyone else...And I do not care what others  think or if they stare at me...after all I am 72 years old and have had shoulder length blond hair for 30 years...so I am used to it...

Lastly, wearing a mask means I do not have to 
wear my false teeth... ha ha ha"
2021-05-17 13:56,"Has anyone noticed that there was not much flu going around this past year? Could masks and increased sanitizing have anything to do with that? Might it not be wise to consider other health benefits of such practices apart from Covid 19? I live in Ontario, Canada, where we are still locked down because of a totally avoidable third wave and I don't get my second shot until late July, so going out unmasked is not an option. Even when we get, hopefully, to August, I might well not give up my mask. When I finally get to visit my Mom in California, after a year and a half, I will absolutely wear a mask on the plane. How is that someone else's concern?"
2021-05-17 13:56,I had a very strong feeling this would happen. Trauma is real.
2021-05-17 13:57,"Mask wearing, apparently, has reduced many of the readers colds, and flu is practically non-existent this year and last. Please remember that many germs are spread from people not washing their hands, then touching their face. Could it be that the increased use of sanitary measures , not so much the mask wearing, has caused this welcome reduction?"

I strongly recommend that all who do not already have N95 respirators go to <a href=""https://shop.projectn95.org"" target=""_blank"">https://shop.projectn95.org</a> and buy N95 respirators. They are a non-profit and do not make any money off your purchase. They thoroughly vet all sources. In fact at this point, they get nearly all products directly from the manufacturer. I am not affiliated with the organization. They are the only source I know of that you can truly rely on for getting N95 respirators that are not counterfeit. If I were you, I would not trust any other source offering N95 respirators that are not counterfeit or fraudulent. Keep in mind N95 respirators are single-use items. Do not reuse N95 respirators.

2021-05-17 13:58,"To avoid allergy/asthma problems and following complications, I've for years used masks outdoors during allergy season. It helps avoid antihistamine use and side effects as well as the primary health problems. Masks also help when indoor air quality is poor. Many public buildings are old, have poor air exchange, have items that gas off chemicals, mold problems, etc. Large stores have many products that ""gas off"" chemicals, and items gas off more chemicals when new, and progressively fewer gases as they age. I think I'll keep wearing the masks unless I know the air is clean."
2021-05-17 13:59,"i was wearing N95 masks on airplanes and public transit (during measles outbreaks) before the pandemic.  i will likely continue to wear them for most indoor situations until this pandemic is completely over, which may be never.  i don't care if other people think i'm weird.  i hope that mask wearing becomes more normalized.  i hope people will wear one when they have the cold or flu."

How will the CDC convince Americans to return to masks in a few months?

The virus has not disappeared. 

There are folks among us who refuse to be vaccinated.

 Children have not been vaccinated.

People who are vaccinated can contract it, with few if any symptoms, but still be contagious. 

Those more than amply suggests a strategy:
continue to wear a mask among strangers; be mask-less only among known and trusted people."
2021-05-17 14:03,Another story on mask-removal? Why should anyone care if someone else wears a mask? We have no knowledge to judge a stranger's motivations. It does no harm to wear a mask.  It has no impact on others. And it might do some good for the wearer's peace of mind. Let's leave each other alone for a while.

Wonder of wonders the owner was complaining about masks and is not vaccinated. Sibling was distressed so I countered that a vaccine is merely another form of credentialing. Like you want a non-vaccinated, non-mask wearing trainer breathing on you. Right.
Point being masks are still needed for protection from the virus and from fools."
2021-05-17 14:04,"In the depths of German winter, epidemiologists, virologists and lay people had to be wearing masks; according to opinion polls it so happened that in particular many experts said they would continue wearing masks indefinitely because that helped steering clear of colds and flu."

2021-05-17 14:06,"Follow the science and don't worry so much about what others are doing or, more importantly, thinking of you.

Those who are fully vaccinated should go about their lives, masked or unmasked, with the knowledge and understanding that there is a very, very low risk of getting sick or passing along the virus to others. 

Those who prefer to wear a mask for literally whatever reason they like should be free to do so unbothered and without judgment. The same courtesy should be offered to those that are vaccinated and are unmasked.

Let's not view these issues in tribalistic ways that has one side ""winning"" the debate and another ""losing."""
2021-05-17 14:07,"This CDC ruling about mask-wearing indoors was premature.  I'm mostly concerned about those who are not vaccinated (and not wearing masks indoors) bringing home the virus to their family, especially those who are elderly.  Also, there is the possibility of variants?  We are still learning more about this virus.  Why did the CDC issue this ruling?  I've not read much about the ""politics"" involved here?  I would expect a careless ruling under Trump, but not under Biden?"

2021-05-17 14:07,"I agree with those who say the virus could still circulate among the asymptomatic (including the vaccinated asymptomatic) - creating more variants - and therefore it would be good to continue masks and distancing when indoors. AND - after a year of masking I find many pluses. I haven't had a cold since 2019, if I wear my mask outside it helps with my allergies, I save a bundle on sunscreen,  and bonus, you don't have to see my wrinkles!"
2021-05-17 14:07,"""For a number of so-called perma-maskers, the decision is informed by trauma: They endured the coronavirus or witnessed loved ones die, and they say taking off their mask makes them feel terrifyingly vulnerable.""

This is absolutely laughable, and this almost border being mentally deranged.  Being informed by ""trauma"" and ""feeling terrifyingly vulnerable"" have no SCIENTIFIC BASIS.  This just makes anti-mask, anti-virus folks look more and more sound with their arguments from the past year.  You can't say you believe in science when  its only convenient for your feelings and fears.  The science is now showing masks are no longer needed, end the use of them now."

We should be compassionate with others.  We should be patient.  But we should also encourage our friends and family to take baby steps, and sometimes giant steps, for their own sakes.  It has been hard to witness the mask-less, but it is also hard to witness the forever-masked."

2021-05-17 13:22,"The article is misleading. Only two paragraphs, buried in the middle, cover anything about backlash against wearing masks. And apparently the Times’ evidence of backlash is first, a quote from Dan Rather, who does not claim to have experienced or seen it, and second, “interviews” that are not revealed. 

Instead, the writer offers a single interview with one person who’s rather out there - double masking with an N95 and wearing googles - and claims a man glared at him in a store. 

Wow! That’s a serious backlash. What’s next, Times, a three part investigation of civil unrest over the Mars Probe?"
2021-05-17 13:53,"Besides a few frightened, short sighted boomers, everyone has lost the masks here in FL

2021-05-17 14:09,"Everyone should continue to wear masks when they need to be within 6 feet of other people outdoors, and when they need to be indoors with other people (unless everyone in the group is vaccinated).  This approach should continue until the case counts and positivity rates are much lower. The science hasn't changed, and the numbers don't lie.  People are still getting sick and dying. We should stay the course until masks, social distancing, and vaccinations significantly reduce community spread.

And please get vaccinated!  It's safe, and it may save your family, friends, and neighbors."

2021-05-17 11:18,"I must admit -- I'm a little bit confused by the framing of this article. The backlash is directed at people who don't plan to take them off? At least in my area, you're far more likely to stand out if unmasked rather than masked (even outdoors, albeit that's slowly changing).

Outside idiots who watch Tucker Carlson, who really cares whether somebody decides to continue wearing masks?"
2021-05-17 14:11,"Wearing a mask is nobody’s business. And to those who challenge the mask wearer, the correct response is “MYOB.” That said, many restrictions were silly from the start and should have been rescinded long ago.
EG: reusable grocery bags were never a hazard and as they are good for the environment, should have been allowed 12 months ago. Indoor swimming pools should have been opened with head count limits. By July or so, all libraries, museums, etc. should have been opened, with mask wearing and limits on crowds. Beaches, trails, playgrounds should have been reopened the minute mask wearing was mandated. 
Ridiculous hardship is never a good prescription."
2021-05-17 14:11,"I genuinely dislike wearing a mask. Despite endless ""hacks"", my glasses would always fog. As someone with chronic sinus issues, I often need to breathe through my mouth, which makes it worse. Still, this was the first winter that I have gone through in decades without getting sick. Not even a cold. Last spring and fall were the lightest allergy seasons that I have had. Having been fully vaccinated for over a month, I will forgo the mask this summer. But when the cold weather returns, the mask might as well. It was truly enjoyable going an entire winter without being ill once. Nice to have saved all that money from not seeing the doctor, buying meds, tissues, cough syrup, etc. For me, wearing a mask provided  benefits that far out weighed the cost of wearing one."
2021-05-17 14:11,"I fully support anyone who feels the need/desire to wear a mask in public, especially when they feel sick. I do think that this article misses a perspective though, that of the hard of hearing/ Deaf community. Masks pose an obvious challenge to this part of the population who have experienced greater rates of depression since the pandemic began. Those who rely on lip-reading, either in-part or wholly, are excluded by 99% of masks sold in stores today. Transparent masks provide a solution, but need to become the norm, not the exception."
2021-05-17 14:14,"We went out shopping for shoes for my husband and to a bookstore yesterday at a nearby mall. Most people (us included) put on the mask when entering the stores even if not required. They did so quietly and those who did not mask up also just went about their activities.
I'd say that it will take a bit of time for each person to find their comfort level - based somewhat on how the statistics fare after this CDC decision."
2021-05-17 14:14,"The difference in the anger aimed at non-maskers in a pandemic and maskers when the pandemic is ostensibly under control (for the vaccinated) is that not wearing a mask did spread a lethal virus. That made it a danger to others. If not for that, I wouldn’t care if you went around lolling your tongue out like Kiss. Wearing a mask now is no danger to others and hence none of others’ business. I don’t get not getting that."
2021-05-17 14:15,"Who doesn't share the desire and/or need to return to a mask-free normal, but the most recent recommendation by the CDC is confusing and fails to consider how it will impact various essential workers, especially those in the retail world, who face frequent exposure to individuals who are not vaccinated and refuse to wear masks.

While I will continue to wear a mask for my own safety and health, I also will continue to wear a mask for the protection and safety of others, especially those who are exposed on a daily basis, like at our grocery store, pet store and pharmacy.  I care about the health of those folks as much as I care about my own."

However, I foresee in the near future a time when I might start doing wearing one of the much more comfortable, vented, N95 masks I own. After all, I am vaccinated, and anyone without a mask would have no room to complain if I continue to protect my health, without worrying about theirs."
2021-05-17 14:16,"I am fully vaccinated and will not wear a mask.  It doesn't make any sense from a scientific/medical viewpoint.  The odds of getting infected are miniscule and the odds of getting infected and having severe symptoms are almost non-existent.  But, I couldn't care less if anyone else chooses to wear a mask.  With liberals it seems to be a badge of honor.  I've seen them wearing a mask all alone in a car or walking outside alone.  I have yet to hear a medical professional who plans on continuing wearing a mask. And I don't care if someone elects not to get vaccinated.  That's their choice.  And it's the public and private sectors choice to insist they continue wearing masks until they get vaccinated.    That's the beauty of a democracy."

Sure some of the reasons I've heard - seemingly meant seriously - border on offensive: ""I'll mask on subways forever, just to keep out sometimes unpleasant smells.""

But I suspect that those who think they'll get some number of fewer cases of ""flu"" over time ... are correct.

And - not that they need my half-hearted support - I'm sure there is STILL so much that's unknown about Covid and (even more so) what perils lie ahead on our ever warmer planet -

that they are making a choice that should not even get them puzzled looks. I don't know the numbers, but I'll bet it's on a par with vegetarianism at this point - not my choice, but I'll admit that I do at least an average amount of things ""because I always have"" or ""because they're easier."""

I will continue wearing a KN95 mask in crowded environments such as grocery stores, airports, public transport, certain work meetings, when visiting elderly, especially in the Winter. Besides of protecting me from Covid, I didn't contract the common cold or flu since last March. I routinely suffer protracted painful sinus and ear infections after a cold, the masks came as a godsend. People in Asia routinely wear masks, so this is not a big deal."
2021-05-17 14:18,"To wear a mask or not is a less important question than:  what quality mask is one wearing ?

As a textile company with close to 200 years experience  it’s bizarre such a national security question remains ignored.

Federal law enforcement of the Textile Fiber Products Identification Act continues to be ignored .

Today still no masks list the fiber content as is required of all textile clothing. Just like when we dress in any of our clothes. There is a tag informing us of what we are putting on ourselves.

To make matters worse the federal government funds masks .  Cotton absorbs moisture like metal to a magnet.  

Woven or knit fabrics, instead of needed  felt fabric ,also easily allow the  Covid -19 virus to pass through. Covid can get stuck and grow making us more susceptible to inhaling a COVID-19 particle too.

If the government had cared about mask fiber content and construction more than insufficient broad edict to wear a mask, the USA would be in a very different position today in regard to our death rate from covid.

Government officials have half heartedly claimed N-95 permeability is the one and only standard when in fact they should  have enforce their own law.  

The public is left with a false sense of security.

Furthermore,  wearing a mask that most  likely is  made out of the wrong fiber or construction is likely counter productive.


How many have died or gotten covid despite having worn a mask ?

Federal government CDC and NIOSH need to be honest with us."
2021-05-17 14:19,"With all those refusing to get vaccinated, in our midst, why would I remove my mask? I recently had a minor surgical procedure.

My inability to see mouths move, plus the increased muffling of speech through masks has impacted my stress level when interacting with others. 

I'm not suggesting that people adapt themselves to my disability. I'm only giving what I feel is a rational reason for disliking the routine use of masks."

Some of the students at our boarding school, again I only recall Asian students wearing blue disposable masks on the buses from the airport. Bow I wouldn’t hesitate to wear a a mask on a plane. Yes I have been vaccinated against COVID but I recall may last trip to Europe I came down with a bad cold a few days after arriving in Portugal that turned into bronchitis. Travel exposes you to hundreds or thousands of others and diseases your body hasn’t seen before. It’s just sensible to wear masks in lots of situations."
2021-05-17 14:25,"People seem to also be missing that being exposed to things is good for the immune system, especially for kids.  There’s a fair amount of evidence suggesting that overly sanitized lives lead to allergies and a variety of auto-immune issues.

Obviously not a reason to go out and get COVID or for folks with health issues to go around without a mask if they don’t want to, but say kindergarteners (as mentioned in the story)?Unfortunately it’s good for them to get all of those colds and minor bugs.  Healthy adults too probably."

In crowded buses/ trains/ flights, may be I will still wear one in future, just to protect myself from other people nearby - whether it's from a cold or covid or whatever.  Esp in flu season - the fact that there are so few flu cases this year due to widespread use of masks is very striking to me.  In some asian countries, daily mask usage in crowded public spaces is very common, even long before covid came along, and I don't think it's a bad idea.  You can't judge someone for not taking theirs off - at the end of the day, you don't know the details of their medical history, and if they have legitimate reasons to be extra careful."

2021-05-17 14:28,"CNN had a piece stating that people at risk - those on immunosuppressant drugs, those with diabetes or heart problems should all continue to wear masks. I take an immunosuppressant, so I plan to get an antibodies test to ensure that my vaccine worked before taking my mask off."
2021-05-17 14:28,"It's interesting to see that in wealthy, liberal neighborhoods ""believe in science"" signs are coupled with mask wearing outdoors, far from others, and in communities that are over 70% vaccinated. There is certainty something cultural at play- an old school protestant ethic of self-sacrifice or public display of virtue and personal conservativism? Not sure. But they certainly ain't believing in science."
2021-05-17 12:33,"A side benefit of a mask was being able to relax my face instead of a semipermanent half smile. People don’t seem to realize that with age, the mouth edges can droop. No, I don’t need to “smile”.  I’m not unhappy, just older!"
2021-05-17 14:29,"I will continue to wear my mask indoors and if I find myself in a crowded outdoor area.  Period.  I don’t know if the unmasked person next to me has been vaccinated or not and even though I am fully vaccinated, I’m not willing to take the risk."

<a href=""https://19andme.covid19.mathematica.org"" target=""_blank"">https://19andme.covid19.mathematica.org</a>/

Death from driving 250 miles is about 1 in a million risk. One micromort.  Non-zero but small and likely worth the reward.

When to take off mask should be when the risk is no more than one micromort or less. Probably less: Driving 250 miles to go to a just ok restaurant seems excessive."
2021-05-17 11:40,The CDC messed up.  This is how we will get uncontrollable variants that will potentially harm even those conscientious and caring enough to get vaccinated! Very disappointing start for Biden's CDC.
2021-05-17 14:30,"This is still America where freedom of choice still prevails, no matter what some people or politicians say. If some people want to wear a mask for the foreseeable future and it makes them comfortable, let them. No one has a right to object or ridicule them. And as to the people or organizations that may object or ridicule them, perhaps if you wear a piece of clothing or a hair style I personally don’t like would you like it if I objected or ridiculed you? Leave people alone."
2021-05-17 14:35,"Hey it’s a free country, you can keep wearing a mask if you prefer, but eventually most of us who have been vaccinated are going to lose patience with those who haven’t. At some point vaccinated people are going to refuse to wear a sweaty uncomfortable mask just to protect other people who should have gotten vaccinated months ago."
2021-05-17 14:35,"I am fully vaccinated. Masks on for me indefinitely. When I lived in Japan, we all wore masks as soon as anyone felt even a cold coming on. It’s what civilized people do for each other. 
Taking into account that we are apparently not pushing Biden to unite the world and institute the Green New Deal to save our species and all other life on earth, new and ancient diseases .are. the new normal. Along with increased uninhabitable locations, increased catastrophic fires and hurricanes…
The CDC destroyed our faith and trust at a crucial, unprecedented time in the history of the world. One could say, as Ezra Klein did, they have blood on their hands. And now that Biden, just like Obama, is essentially accomplishing nothing important after so many of us put or faith in him… here we still are."
2021-05-17 13:18,"Totally ridiculous that the harmless and sensible face mask has been coopted in the endless US culture wars. Face masks constitute public health safety. For those who choose to continue to wear them, their decision has merit and needs to be respected. Anyone who feels threatened by that, well, get over it already."
2021-05-17 14:36,"I am a teacher and we have been all in most of the year. Although, I am fully vaccinated, we still wear masks. Do I like wearing a mask? No. But I have not caught one cold this year. I have been the healthiest I have ever been. I didn't need antibiotics or Nyquil. I think the cold remedy companies would like us to take our masks off so they can start selling their remedies again. I, for one, will still wear masks in public spaces and wash my hands often!"
2021-05-17 14:36,"Why the backlash against people who choose to wear a mask?  Unlike those who refused to wear a mask during the peak of the pandemic, wearing a mask has zero effect on the health of others.  This is not a “both sides” or “tables have turned” type issue.  In terms of public health consequences, this is akin to publishing a story shaming someone for wearing a coat during the summer."
2021-05-17 14:37,"""What's the downside to wearing masks?"" We are social creatures. Our faces are exquisitely rich with social information. They allow us to better understand other humans' emotions and intentions, and to convey our own. They are a primary means of communication, with 42 fine muscles designed to convey the subtlest attitudinal inflections. People are entitled to wear masks whenever they want, but I think anyone who doesn't appreciate the value of exposed faces fundamentally misunderstands human beings."
2021-05-17 14:37,"I, too, plan to continue wearing a mask. I am fully vaccinated but I don't believe we know enough about the efficacy of the vaccine to warrant ripping off our masks in glee. How long will the vaccine protect me? Will it protect from newer emerging variants? I am also cynical after this experience. People lie. Period. People will take off their masks knowing full well they have not been vaccinated. Do I trust my fellow man to tell the truth? I do not. That is why I will be wearing a mask for the foreseeable future."
2021-05-17 14:38,"People NOT wearing masks when a potentially deadly virus was spreading unchecked - prior to wide vaccine availability - were a threat to everyone.

Folks wearing a mask now, including after vaccination, are a threat to no one.

If you can’t understand the difference, it’s because you don’t want to."
2021-05-17 14:38,"I am fully vaccinated. I’m not concerned with outdoors but I will continue to wear a mask whenever I enter a store and use hand sanitizer when I leave the store. Two reasons. First, I don’t want to get Covid even if I would be asymptomatic. I don’t want that virus in my body at all. We don’t yet know all the long term ramifications. It could lie dormant for months and then flair up. And second, I like the idea of not breathing in other peoples germs in close quarters. I think if other people are bothered by my wearing a mask it is because they know they are taking a risk by going maskless indoors and my wearing a mask reminds them of this. Too bad. I managed to avoid getting Covid thus far and see no reason to change my behavior."
2021-05-17 14:40,"""Virginia, like many states, has an “Anti- Mask Law“. It shall be unlawful for any person over 16 years of age to, with the intent to conceal his identity, wear any mask, hood or other device whereby a substantial portion of the face is hidden or covered so as to conceal the identity of the wearer.""

By the end of June this 9/11 leftover law comes into effect again. The Gov had better think about getting this repealed or at least making an addendum to it allowing for during epidemics and/or pandemics."
2021-05-17 14:40,"It would be really nice if we could return to a point where we all mind our own business. Instead, many are still trying to control others in regard to mask wearing. I’m following the guidance and not wearing a mask except where still mandated but I’m sympathetic toward people who still want to. In my area, it’s still more likely that people are trying to force mask wearing on others than the other way around. The kindergarten teacher in this story is a great example. She wants to continue wearing a mask which is fine but also wants her students to continue wearing them indefinitely—which is not fine."
2021-05-17 14:41,"Some of the many ""side affects"" from wearing a mask will persist I suspect which include:
1)Reduced illnesses such as flu and the common cold. To avoid these future illnesses, especially with air travel, I can see mask wearing hanging on.
2)Hiding your face. Not unlike having a full beard wearing a mask gives you a bit of privacy in a crowded world and enables you to respond to your social environment somewhat confidentially. There are times when most have this desire for one reason or another."
2021-05-17 14:41,"I think many people have a vastly inflated impression of how effective ""face coverings"" are at reducing the spread of airborne respiratory viral infections. We are talking, at best, about a few percentage points.  

Masks have become little more than talismans of virtue signalling. 

I suspect the CDC knows this, and has known this, all along."
2021-05-17 14:41,I have no problem with people wearing masks for the foreseeable future. I will point out though that in the before times I was asked to remove my hat and sunglasses before entering a bank ... so ... Let's see how THAT goes.
2021-05-17 14:41,"Haven't worn a mask outside since pretty much the beginning of this because we didn't have to here in FL and it's not that congested. But now glad that I don't have to wear a mask inside. Vaccinated and no longer care about any risks, as CDC confirms.

Even here in the deep blue Orange County it's pretty loose and very few wore masks outside. The cult of the mask has not permeated the normal non-freaked out states.

Life was already pretty normal here, with full time school and everything open 100% but now with the new CDC recommendations people are even more relaxed knowing they (the vaccinated at least) are not at risk.

Everyone else is free to wear a mask or 2 or 10 on their head for as long as they want. Though they will certainly be outliers here in Florida."
2021-05-17 13:52,"Glad to finally see some backlash in the other direction.  Now certain Far Left will see how it feels when Complete Strangers make gross assumptions about you and then feel the right to shame or chide you.

I once had a total stranger chide me on an otherwise empty sidewalk in the Great Outdoors....she came up from Behind me (where I obviously didn't see her) and then made it a point to stop (and some might say, gasp, 'endanger' herself in the process) and scold me.  I said nothing...gave a curt little smile...held up my cup of coffee (that I'd been drinking) for her to see, and continued on my way.

Mind you, I mask everywhere, even outdoors (until only very recently, where I now pull my mask below my nose while outdoors, and then as approaching others, will pull it back up).  The woman who scolded me knew Nothing about me or my usual habits, yet wanted to be able to pat herself on the back, by scolding me.  

I may be Liberal, but I can't stand the Far Left kneejerk groupthink and juvenile behaviors exhibited this past year vis-a-vis COVID protocols...the shaming of others, posting selfies of themselves while proudly declaring that they now 'double-mask'...the vaccine selfies, etc.

So if I, a Liberal, couldn't stand this smug, childish mindset, I can only imagine what other folks think.

And yes, politicizing masks can indeed go both ways, though one side continues to suggest that only folks from the other side can behave badly."
2021-05-17 14:43,I haven't seen or heard of any people objecting to others wearing masks. The objection is to them being forced to wear a mask.
2021-05-17 13:46,"-Some people are a bit paranoid, uncertain, over-cautious,..and prefer having a little separation from others.  
 A lot of San Franciscans have always been like that.  They like their masks.."
2021-05-17 14:44,"I feel like many people are forgetting that masks were never meant to be permanent. If we keep masks forever, many people’s immune systems, including children who develop immunities early on, will be weakened, and this will be worse for them in the long run. Everyone was fine not wearing masks before COVID-19 hit, so why do so many people feel the need to keep wearing one after it goes away?"
2021-05-17 14:44,"I expect that I will stop wearing masks in a lot of situations once I'm fully vaccinated and the mask mandate is lifted.  However, I will start to wear them when I'm feeling under the weather to protect other people, and I will probably wear one when I fly anywhere.  Seems like I was always picking up some sort of bug when I flew somewhere, and it has derailed vacation plans more than once when I've had to cancel out of some planned excursion because I was too sick to enjoy it.  I don't expect the airlines' current focus on strict sanitation standards to last much past the time when the pandemic restrictions are lifted."
2021-05-17 14:34,"We will always wear a mask indoors, but especially when we cross the border into Idaho. To my lightly educated neighbors to the east, proven vaccines are spooky voodoo similar to ""The Origin of the Species"" or wind power generation."
2021-05-17 13:27,"I have been perplexed by the whole drama around masking. What is the big deal about wearing a mask?!  The selfishness is astonishing. Where is the fortitude of your average American? We are not refugees, having our homes bombed or living under a dictator; we are not starving or losing our children to hunger. Those of you who howl to high heaven about your “freedoms,” what a joke, if it weren’t so pathetic. The CDC clearly made a political decision here, and I certainly don’t trust Americans any longer to take care of their neighbors. I’ll be masking in indoors in public places until Covid is gone, which probably means forever."
2021-05-17 14:46,"I thought my wearing a mask only protects others against me giving them the virus. If I wear a mask, the science has been that it doesn't protect me from GETTING the virus; only protects others in case I have it. Are people forgetting this? Or has that changed? So, wearing a mask doesn't help me--it helps others."
2021-05-17 12:56,"People with halitosis don't want masks. It really makes them uncomfortable, breathing their own breath, and they cannot say it publicly. It makes for a non negligible percentage of anti-maskers."
2021-05-17 14:46,"The two studies that Walensky cited actually established a lower vaccine efficacy rate,  89-90%, as compared to the manufacturers' initial claims of 94-95%.  In addition,  it has been established that symptomatic and asymptomatic infected people can transmit the disease.  It has also been known for some time that mask effectiveness is highly variable.

What that means for the average vaccinated or unvaccinated person is clear.   The grocery store you shop in, formerly permitting only those people wearing a mask, will now become a major path of aerosolized transmission from all people.  This  raised risk cannot be  eliminated simply by wearing a mask yourself.  In addition,  the raised community risk created by the store as virus transmission center cannot be reversed.   

It would be better if all businesses were to find new opportunities to segregate their services or hours in order to allow vaccinated people patronize their business in safety."
2021-05-17 14:46,"Years ago, my first, much anticipated visit to Hawai’i was sharply diminished due to a cold I believe I picked up on the plane flight to the islands. Had I been wearing a mask, this frustrating event may not have happened.

Furthermore, I walk for exercise nearly every day, often near vehicle traffic. Learning—over the years—how pollution decreases lifespan, I feel that mask-wearing as a result of Covid-instituted guidelines has reduced my intake of airborne carcinogens.

Thus, despite being fully vaccinated, continued mask wearing makes sense for me."
2021-05-17 14:47,"I have been fully vaccinated for more than a month. I too will continue wearing my mask in stores, etc. 

All my life, even as a kid in school, catching a cold inevitably evolved into bronchitis. Am otherwise pretty healthy. How pleasant it’s been not having had a sniffle for over a year!"
2021-05-17 14:47,"I think there's room for a third category of ""Let's see how it goesers.""  I would say I am one of them.  I have been sheltering in place for over year, having food and medicine delivered, and even though I have been fully vaccinated since the end of April, I am making only slight changes, such as buying a few items at the supermarket in person at 10PM when no one is there, and having the rest, up to 90%, delivered.  Because everything we have thrown at Covid-19 either hasn't worked at all (especially after Trump and conservatives praised it) or hasn't worked as well as can be expected, I wanted to see how the numbers did, which until today were no better than they had been at any other point since last March.  

Yesterday, the US reported 16,616 cases according to the New York Times data.  That's lower than the lowest points last summer, when it dipped into the 18,000s before we started reopening and numbers went up again.  That's one data point, true, but it is unexpected and interesting.  The effect of vaccines?  We will see.   

I don't plan to rush back to ""normal,"" but I don't plan to live this way forever, either.  I will follow the data and see how it goes.  From that, my new normal will emerge.  Put me down for category #3."
2021-05-17 14:48,"Here in my county, Knox TN, the infection rate is still high, per the NYT. I'm vaccinated, but a 10% risk of contracting the illness is statistically significant. I prefer to avoid that risk. 

Add to this the fact that the majority of unmasked individuals in my county are also anti-vaxx. IMO, this call for unmasking is meant to exonerate the people who simply don't care about public health. Well too bad. They can continue to look at my masked face in crowded public spaces. Maybe some of them will grow a conscience."
2021-05-17 14:48,"It's an interesting question, why do I care? I don't care enough to get angry at the person. But it is distancing when someone is masked outdoors. I won't be picking up a conversation with the person, as I'm assuming the person is unsettled by my prescence and in the end I don't like that feeling."
2021-05-17 14:49,"This sudden change by Dr. Fauci and our government does not reinforce my faith in either.  I think this has become now even political for Biden (whom I support) because of his push to get everyone vaccinated - no matter what - apparently.  I hope I am wrong , but I fear this come back to haunt us."
2021-05-17 14:08,"I would like to see somewhat of a middle ground after Covid-19 is under control -- mouth shields (transparent) that allow you to see the person's mouth, them to breath unrestricted, but which provides a barrier against expectorate and droplets while talking or sneezing.  These have been created for food service workers, but I think they could be useful if kitchen (<a href=""https://www.paperandlinen.com/products/masks/spit-guard"" target=""_blank"">https://www.paperandlinen.com/products/masks/spit-guard</a>/), cafeteria, nursing home and other workers were to wear them while working.  I don't think there's much virus that is spread from normal exhaling, from an asymptomatic Covid infected person."
2021-05-17 14:11,Some of us who are retirees or those that work from home are a significant proportion of this group. Our pandemic requirements made us realize that with a few changes we could live that lifestyle without being some kind of a nut like Howard Hughes or we didn't care  if we did.
2021-05-17 14:26,"I would have thought that the non-maskers would be dancing in the streets, celebrating this decision by the C.D.C.  So why continue to harass those who have the desire to keep their own mask on?  

It feels as if there is no pleasing a mindset that is determined to be hurtful and a bully to others who are merely minding their own business."
2021-05-17 14:52,"Even though I take allergy medication, I still have fairly severe allergic symptoms to grass, tree, and weed pollen. Now I've realized that I can hike in the woods and meadows with a mask on. I will hike with a mask from now on. I will also continue to wear a mask in indoor public places because of covid until my own personal risk assessment says I don't need one. I'm fully vaccinated, but the entire world is really sick from covid still. A mask is a precaution; why should other people care, or condemn, people who take precautions during a pandemic? Are we so sure that scientists have all the information correct, at this point in time, about everything to do with this worldwide virus that is still evolving and spreading?"
2021-05-17 14:52,"Even before Covid, as a retired ex-New Yorker now living in very red-state Montana, well, it's been an experience. All of last year there had been a quite sizeable portion of people who I'd see shopping in the supermarkets, post-office, etc. who never wore a mask. That portion has grown considerably now that the mask restrictions are off. (I forgot to mention that Montana's new Republican Governor who believes the election was stolen, put out a mandate as soon as he took office that masks were not needed anymore.) I still put on a mask when I enter the post-office, market or a restaurant. I'll continue to wear it until, well, I don't feel I need to any longer; this may very well be in Autumn or Winter. The local bank has recently re-opened their indoor lobbies once again, and though I'm still wearing a  face-mask, I'm wondering how long it will be before banks put up notices that wearing a mask inside the premises is 'against the law'. (being a person without a car makes the drive-through services unattainable for me, and others)."
2021-05-17 14:52,"I certainly welcome the CDC's new guidance and I trust it, but I believe the writer overstates the cultural war aspect of why many people still want to mask in certain situations. Some of it is just general caution. We just lived through the worst pandemic in 100 years while a crazy president and his administration mismanaged it. I'll bet some of it is due to people still being traumatized and not wanting to let their guard down. I believe as the number of covid deaths and infections go down, people will feel better about not relying on masks. Even people who are generally rational and look at science can still experience wariness due to trauma. The CDC recommendation is less than a week old, give people a chance!

And yes in some cases, people are over cautious (piling on an extra mask over an n95 is a bit much), but so what? Are they hurting anybody? Their behavior won't impede my or other vaccinated people's ability to lessen our mask use. 

Such a waste of space in the NYT."
2021-05-17 14:53,"I’m vaccinated yet hesitant to remove my mask in crowded spaces for several reasons. As a person at high risk of covid complications, I’m concerned about getting covid long hauler symptoms even if my case doesn’t put me in the hospital. Add in that the percentage of Americans who are not vaccinated remains high and the rest of the world is lagging so far behind on vaccinations that new variants continue to arise much more quickly than scientists predicted. It’s great that so far the current vaccines appear to handle them, albeit at less efficacy than the original strain. What I find most concerning, however, is the CDC’s decision to limit monitoring of breakthrough infections in vaccinated people. Don’t we need to know as quickly as possible if a variant escapes the vaccine’s protection? This would seem THE most important statistic to track if we don’t want to repeat the experience of 2020."
2021-05-17 13:10,"I can understand that some might feel more comfortable continuing to wear a mask, and I imagine that for quite a few they will give it up sooner than later as things open up and covid continues to wane. But sorry Ms. Cohen (the teacher), imposing that on others forever isn’t right. Do you want a flu pandemic? That’s one way to get a flu pandemic. As a teacher, I know the crud you get off kids can be awful, but exposure to germs in early childhood is essential for the immune system (it’s part of why other Coronaviruses no longer kill us). If your immune system isn’t up to dealing with that, you need to consider if that is the right workplace for you."
2021-05-17 14:56,"The NY Times still lists my county as High Risk for Covid, so I still wear a mask.  When my county is listed as low risk I may use it less often.  I feel safer behind a mask since people talk loudly and often cough and sneeze without covering their faces.  I can’t imagine why anyone would care if I am wearing a mask or not."
2021-05-17 12:41,"The only harm in wearing masks indefinitely is that the political right might say the left is and always was crazy. They aren’t, but it doesn’t help our political goals. People that are going to mask indefinitely are rare, the exception. People that want to keep masking for now are not unreasonable, seeing as epidemiologists actually recommend it. If you go without a mask you will encounter the virus as only 1/3 are fully vaccinated and 1/2 have one shot, and a lot of those folks are clustered. Viral illnesses are thought to be one of the primary causes of myalgic encephalomyelitis (ME), aka chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS). Covid can cause as yet unexplained nerve damage, brain changes, lungs, heart, blood vessels… does the vaccine prevent all that? I hope so. But does science know yet what body-wide changes if any occur in a mild case while vaccinated? COVID-19 primarily affects the lungs but it can damage many other organs as well. This organ damage may increase the risk of long-term health problems. I hope that these risks vaccinated are all now at “94% safe”.

Some folks are worried science doesn’t know enough about the vaccine. I see the opposite problem: science doesn’t know enough about the virus. 

Also I read older folks, and my dad is 82, may have a lesser effectiveness on the vaccine due to weaker immune systems etc.

My plan is to keep masking till herd immunity, or till other vaccinated folks are reporting back fine en mass. Yes, I’m using you as a Guinea pig."
2021-05-17 14:14,The biggest question I have after reading this is how did Mr. Glickman contract COVID even though he has worn a double mask for 14 months?
2021-05-17 14:57,"Like Mr. Rather said,
 “I’m confused,” the retired news anchor Dan Rather wrote on Twitter last week as backlash mounted on the platform to those still masked. “Why should people care if someone wants to wear a mask outside?”
I went to the grocery store today (Publix removed their mask requirement) thinking everyone would be mask less, especially considering how right leaning my community is.  I went into the store, and still lots of folks wearing masks... taken aback, I thought I was in the wrong- Go figure."
2021-05-17 14:58,"One thing that I thing society needs to keep doing post pandemic: CLEANING PUBLIC SPACES
Although I have already witnessed this declining.  So many germs and viruses are spread from door handles, tables, you name it. At the beginning every store, gas station, business was cleaning everything, but now hardly anyone is.  Honestly we would have a lot less sick people if public spaces were cleaned better."
2021-05-17 14:58,I follow the science until I don't. The exact same people who pillarred the rest of us for not following the science to wear a mask suddenly do as they please. Who really has the high moral ground?
2021-05-17 14:58,"We are still outdoors with our Sunday mass. We brought back our choir ( I’m a Member).
We have been singing with masks on and we are all vaccinated. We are isolated  in our location relative to the other participants  and decided we will start singing without masks next week."
2021-05-17 14:58,"My immediate and extended family will mostly be vaccinated. Although our state is opening up mask wearing, we plan to continue wearing them in public, stores, work. Recent reports suggest that anti-vaxxers will probably lie about their vaccination status and stay with their ethics of not wearing masks. Obviously, someone is buying these fake vaccination cards. So, why should my family take ridicule or take the risk, when we know even in highly vaccinated states like Massachusetts, we run the risk of exposure from someone, either a reside of Massachusetts or a visitor.

These generations are far from the ""The Greatest Generation"" mentioned of people during WWII - at that time, people worked for the common good. Now, I don't think we can trust that will happen."
2021-05-17 14:58,"Why do people care at this point if people mask into next year? Not wearing one was potentially deadly to those around you during the height of the pandemic; after vaccinations, the mask is an item of clothing chosen by the wearer. (That said, I still wear one to make others comfortable or if they ask - being considerate and all that). 

I would liken it to UPF-rated clothing - some older women in my neighborhood walk in full to the wrist and to the ankle UPF clothing, with broad rim hats, sunglasses, and in the case of one - a UPF-rated umbrella. They’ve chosen lower risk of melanoma over other considerations. I don’t care what they wear on their walk. It isn’t my body. 

I don’t care if someone wants to wear two masks and goggles as they shop. As long as they aren’t yelling at others about it anymore! Or forcing store employees to attempt to enforce mask wearing on their behalf - I think it’s shameful that we forced lower-wage workers to ever be our arbiters and enforcers as they were always in an unsafe and unsupported position if they said anything."
2021-05-17 14:13,"Fine with me if people want to be extra cautious for a while.  It does no harm to anyone, unlike the severe damage the no-maskers have done.  Having said that, the article doesn't describe much of a ""backlash"" - a few glares and comments from family and friends.  You'll just have to be thick-skinned enough to tolerate that."
2021-05-17 13:37,"I am baffled. Reading the comments on other pages on this site one would think all the hostility is directed towards those who are no longer wearing masks (and who have every right to refrain). Who is objecting to those who feel vulnerable wearing them, as long as they are not bullying others into it? 

The policy here has all along been officially that if you can't wear one without it being a problem, you are not obliged to do so but the tone online is such that, having found that I can't wear one without getting ill, I have stayed away. From everything. For over a year. I don't think that's OK now we have vaccines available to the vulnerable. Even our idiot Prime Minister, in the same breath in which he says those who can't don't have to has the nerve to say those not wearing one should be 'shamed' - as if there's not enough shameful bullying of the disabled in society already. Mr Neely, quoted in the article, is quite wrong in thinking that it's not difficult for anyone. 

People must do what is right for them. If you want to wear a mask, do. Though I do wonder how Mr Glickman gets on as a musician in this state and I am worried about the woman who would like to mask small children indefinitely. It's not normal, it's a problem for some people with respiratory problems, and how is their cognitive development being affected when this interferes with their ability to learn to read faces, never mind language development?"
2021-05-17 15:00,"A robust immune system is the best long term defense. Yes, masks and the vaccines are needed in exceptional circumstances, such as the last year. But those who continue to wear masks - especially parents who may require their kids to wear masks - run a risk of cultivating a generation of people with weakened immune systems. If you aren't exposed to a variety of bacteria and viruses as a youth (and that also means playing outside and getting dirty), my bet is that those youth and young adults will be compromised in 10 or 15 years. But I think most parents know this - that getting sick (or at least being exposed to a wide variety of potential illnesses) is part of growing up and is what keeps pandemics from happening more often.  

Enjoy"
2021-05-17 15:00,"I know dozens of women of all ages (and some men) throughout the country who love the anonymity of the mask and will never give it up. Keeping them and others healthy in a pandemic is great, but not having strange men tell them to “smile” or just generally bothering them is a great relief and will not be easily given up."
2021-05-17 12:13,"I have no issue with others opting to wear mask but find the uninformed reasoning of most to be more than a little sad because it based on fear and not facts. On the extreme opposite end, the made up facts and faulty logic of the anti-science, anti-vaccine people on the far right is no less concerning.

Per the CDC, *if you are vaccinated* it doesn't matter who around you is vaccinated or not -- you are at minimal risk of being infected and virtually ""zero"" risk of becoming seriously ill per the CDC and Dr. Fauci. 

My entire family and I have even completely vaccinated since the end of February and I am done with the masks and am gladly going bare-faced everywhere. I did my part for the last 14 months and am ready to return to normal. 

Please continue to wear your mask if you wish, but let's strike a bargain - you keep your dirty looks to yourself about my unmasked face and I will make sure to restrain myself from an eye-roll or smirking at your masked one. 

And as another poster said, if you are not already, go get vaccinated now!"
2021-05-17 15:00,"There is still a lot they don't know about this virus, it's transmission and the variants.  Keeping my mask on except for very uncrowded, open outdoors spaces.  I think it is quite unfair to front line workers, such as grocery checkers, to allow ""vaccinated"" people to go maskless inside.  No one knows who has been vaccinated.  Senseless risk for the small sacrifice of wearing a face covering when around others indoors unless family or friends."
2021-05-17 15:00,"I would like to know if the CDC is identifying and doing contact tracing on the people who have been infected with the Indian and Brazilian variants?  If so, are they requiring quarantine?  Do they actually know who all of these people are?

I’d also like to know how the CDC explains how the Indian variant broke through fully vaccinated with Pfizer or Moderna airport workers, hospital employees and others in Singapore which caused the country to reintroduce restrictions."
2021-05-17 15:00,"If we continue to use masks judiciously we may eventually save an equivalent number of people who would otherwise die of the flu or are immune compromised. 

If just to save myself from another sore throat I will continue to mask when at work or around children. 

In addition, Mother Earth is not finished with us. This virus can be considered another warning of global warming. The earth is not in balance and when it is not the earth strikes back

Until we recognize our shared humanity another virus will come along again and again . This isn’t a once in a lifetime event."
2021-05-17 15:01,"The smart money is on continuing to wear a mask. The simple reason is...variants. The first way we will find out the vaccine doesn't work on a specific variant is to see people start dying. Why be one of those? If and when there has been a considerable time passed without variant driven flare-ups, then maybe it is safer. 
And in terms of someone telling me to take off my mask, they can have their opinion but they certainly aren't going to impact my decision. In the slightest."
2021-05-17 15:01,"I may be a bit of an anomaly (haven't read the comments yet to find out), but I both think that the CDC made a horrible and irresponsible decision last week AND plan to ditch my mask the minute I'm fully vaccinated. 

I can never remember if the ability to hold two contradictory ideas in one's head at the same time is a sign of high intelligence or a sign of insanity. It's probably the latter, but I choose to believe it's the former."
2021-05-17 15:02,"I’m pretty allergic to pollen, live in a very wooded area and have kept on wearing a mask outdoors just for that reason. It works wonders.

We see one another by more than a face."
2021-05-17 15:05,"Until my daughter is fully vaccinated, our masks stay on when around strangers indoors. With only 40% of Americans vaccinated, it seems premature to do otherwise. There were almost 30,000 new cases yesterday, approx 22% of which will be children (according to the American Association of Pediatricians). And 600,000 Americans have died, the equivalent of the entire city of Baltimore, MD wiped off the face of the Earth. As India foretells, we have a long way to go yet."
2021-05-17 15:05,"FYI...If you have blood cancer, you probably don't have sufficient antibodies--if any at all--after being vaccinated, so you will still need a mask, and you will need everyone to get vaccinated.

And it turns out that the treatments for Covid do not work well on people with leukemia."

I also cannot wait to say goodbye to them, and seriously question the health risks of breathing in detergent and fibers from all of these masks.  Humans are not meant to wear masks, no animal is, and at a certain point we are all going to have to start getting colds again.  It’s a part of life. Kindergartners have always been germy.

This seems a bit obtuse.  I mean, of course, lighten up and allow people to take safety measures if they don't feel safe.  I'm not going to judge people for going too far.  They aren't the ones who have gotten so many people killed in this thing  But at the same time statements like these ignore that the social pressure cuts both ways.  Someone who is vaccinated and trusting in THAT science by going outside unmasked and then facing glares from masked people and being told that they and their family deserve to get sick and die, it's pretty easy to understand why some people are frustrated by those who insist on continuing with masks at points when they aren't necessary.   

We should recognize that everyone out there is under some kind of pressure in this thing."

2021-05-17 13:39,"Choosing to wear a mask or not after the pandemic recedes is, of course, an individual choice — the trouble lies, inevitably, in what each of us thinks everyone else *should* be doing.

Indeed, there is a section of our brains that is dedicated to recognizing just faces.   In order for that to develop, facial recognition was obviously an important part of our biological and social evolution.   Indeed speaking for myself, as annoying as wearing a mask is, what makes me even more uncomfortable is to be around others who are wearing a mask.  I think we are messing with deeply ingrained human biology which beyond partisanship, somewhat explains this visceral rejection of mask wearing.  And one can only guess the havoc this will play in the development of communication and social skills of infants and toddlers who are now surrounded by mask wearing adults."

A lot of people are scared and will stay that way for a long time and there is no shame in being scared at something that has killed so many people, but for those like myself who have been vaccinated and have been told that it will be the way out of this crisis, I want to stop wearing a mask everywhere as soon as possible.

Since the lockdown started I have only gotten sick once and that was after a grocery run. During Winter it was really nice to run with an N95 mask on and I've gotten used to it. So I'll keep the mask on whenever I go grocery shopping. Not getting sick has been really pleasant and I'd like to keep it that way. In fact, I just bought two 24-pack boxes of N95 masks. As it has been the case in Asia we're going to deal with pandemics on a regular basis."

I am a very frequent traveler using planes, trains, buses, automobiles year round. My job puts me in contact with thousands of complete and total strangers every month. My issue is and has been that if I get sick I can't go home. Studies indicate that immune suppressed individuals on the same medication regiment that my partner is taking have a less than eight percent chance that they will develop antibodies to covid-19 after getting the vaccine. Now that everyone is not wearing masks I now have to 'step up my game' and be even more diligent in the attempt to protect myself and my partner because now the opportunity to encounter an infected person has exponentially increased with no mask mandates in place. There is no clear evidence to date that even though fully vaccinated I will not contract coronavirus and there is no clear evidence that there will be zero chance that I could transmit coronavirus to my partner should I become exposed or infected, asymptomatic or not. Most interestingly, having been put out of work because of the pandemic for more than a year, with mask wearing, social distancing and not being around strangers I have not had a single cold or respiratory infection since this all started of which I suffered a few times a year. There I was thinking I was just sensitive to the environment. Now I know it wasn't me."

It confronts them with what they already know is true but do not want to admit to themselves. That’s maybe why some people get angry.

2021-05-17 14:28,"Re: ""“Why should people care if someone wants to wear a mask outside?”

Because our society, and western society in general, is built upon individual identity.  Showing one's face so one may be recognized as an individual is bedrock to Anglo-European (and most other) societies.  Covering one's face = concealing one's individual identity = bank robbers, assassins, and othe anti-social behavior.

Vaccine passports need to become a reality asap.   Stores that are quick to jump on letting go of mask mandates, let's see how their customers feel, perhaps cautious vaccinated customers will shop at stores that still require masks or order groceries for delivery.   Those of us who want to be cautious can show our opinion by not spending money.   This is all nothing but politics and moves to increase spending in the coming summer months.

If so, mild exposure to regular and well-understood viruses may have some long-term advantages that we should not ignore."

As long as I can remember, people have been utterly cavalier about sneezing and coughing in public places and at work as if spreading influenza and the common cold are simple facts of life -- tough for me if I should catch your disease. Every year I have caught at least one such disease or another frequently losing a few days from work.

There is a cost to every choice. Wearing masks might work for someone and they should do it, but it also limits communication. Facial expressions, enunciation.... all will be affected."

We in India are a suffering lot because the virus attacking and killing my brethren is a combination of three variants. A deadly variant, different from that of the one found in Britain, South Africa and Brazil.
Of course, wearing face mask all the time is difficult. We find difficult in breathing and uneasiness. Better to find a solitary place every now and then and remove the mask and breath easy. We have to encourage ourselves and live this pandemic.

2021-05-17 15:27,"As stated before, I work in an optical shop, in sometimes very close quarters with my patients and clients.  I am masked, and will continue to be; I have always been a slightly obsessive hand washer, so that hasn’t changed; I still clean all my frames tried on, and surfaces touched.   I allow people to remove their masks, away from me, into the “best” mirror in the house, so they may see themselves fully trying on a frame.  
   I am fully immunized.  
   I suffer from chronic nasal issues, and asthma, which haven’t been reduced by mask wearing, actually have gotten slightly worse (the extra humidity up my nose from the mask, exacerbates), but I never got a cold or flu, and so I’m sticking to it. 
   I feel taking the extra precautions is safe for me and for my patients.  I would feel terrible if contact with me and our shop ended with someone getting ill, not to mention the bad publicity that would be inevitable in our small community.  
  Personally, I can’t help but feel that there has been over exuberance on the part of the CDC, along with perhaps state governments, that are under tremendous pressure from special interests to open. It just seems awfully soon, especially with variants out there.  
   I suspect at some point, someone will “call me out” about it.  Isn’t “living free” and being “self determined” part of this? I’ve always called it “live and let live”."
2021-05-17 15:28,"There’s very different levels of vulnerability. If you’re elderly or have a preexisting condition you’re much more at risk then most people. I’m vaccinated and won’t be masking as I’m not in one of those groups, but completely understand why people would."
2021-05-17 15:28,"For people over 55, continuing to mask in the environment where new variants of the coronavirus are emerging is probably  good practice. The general population, Public Health Officials, and the Politicians have all been wrong on timing of masks, shut downs, vaccinations, predicted curves and almost all things associated with the pandemic. So taking some individual responsibily and not throwing caution to the wind seems prudent!"
2021-05-17 15:13,"What a curious nation we have become, where those of us who choose to wear a mask for reasons related to personal safety, or out of consideration for the safety of others, must worry about the scorn and ridicule of our fellow Americans.

Wouldn't it be interesting if emergency responders and health care workers were also ridiculed, since they are also acting for the protection and safety of others?"
2021-05-17 14:40,"Anecdotally, I hear that the ""masquerading"" of the last year has staved off many other communicable illnesses.

And I have long observed in international airports that crowds coming from Asian countries tend to wear masks.

So, maybe it is not such a bad thing, albeit not the nicest thing in the world."
2021-05-17 14:09,"I hope people will leave alone those who choose to wear the masks going forward. Many in the AAPI communities have long had the habit of wearing masks during cold or flu seasons. Hopefully the AAPI communities, which have suffered increases in prejudices and hate crimes during the pandemic, won’t continue to be harassed post-COVID for wearing masks."
2021-05-17 15:13,"I like the idea of wearing a mask if you think you have a respiratory illness.  It does demonstrate respect of others, however in this country there are many people who have a high disregard for others."
2021-05-17 15:27,"What a curious nation we have become, where those who take actions to protect their own health, and the health of others, are subjected to public scorn and ridicule."
2021-05-17 14:59,"It would be nice if going forward we could adopt what they do in Japan; people voluntarily wearing masks when they are sick. 

I really dislike getting the flu, and a flu shot is generally only 2/3 effective."
2021-05-17 15:31,I broke a upper front tooth and I am in the middle of an implant procedure. A mask allows me to go out and about without my dental flip. It also reduces the need to shave. It has its plus sides. I also imagine in at awful to wear on hot humid days. May-September in half the country.
2021-05-17 15:31,"Seems to me we masked to save the vulnerable, most of all. In the US, many elderly are now vaccinated. The new vulnerable group is the very young--variants are sweeping India and Brazil that seem much more opportunistic in making young people seriously ill. It has been a race of vaccine vs variants, and we are not done yet. So far, the US has been lucky about variants. I am vaccinated. But people bring small children into grocery stores or coffee shops. I realize the risk is low that I can carry or transmit the virus now, but time ticks on, variants arise, vaccine protection will wane or require a booster. I am keeping the mask around, I am sticking with outside venues this summer, hoping to see cases continue to drop. I'm OK taking extra precautions for a bit longer."
2021-05-17 15:32,"COVID aside, I haven't gotten sick with cold or flu since the pandemic began. The mask is the key. I will wear it in highly populated outdoor situations and whenever I'm inside(not at home). I don't like breathing other peoples exhaust into my body anymore."
2021-05-17 15:26,"I am by no means, anti-mask, but there have been bad actors using the masks as a way to hide their identity in the case of robberies, assaults etc... If we normalize the wearing of masks for perpetuity we are giving these criminals the upper hand."
2021-05-17 14:50,"It's the increasing insularity that is the disease that is killing this country. I'm done with masks. I'm vaccinated. I'll wear them in indoor spaces until the numbers come down, then I'm done. 

Why does America seem like it's losing it's collective mind? Why does anti-science have a grip on so many? Why are so many so easily manipulated by extremist rhetoric? Why do so many feel like they need guns? Why is anxiety and depression rising generation by generation. 

Maybe the same reason auto-immune diseases are on the rise. For the most part, we live larval lives in designed suburbs, where we get into a car and rarely interact with people outside of work. We go home and surf the net and watch Netflix. What's killing us is exactly this insularity. 

The American dream seems to be a perfect expression of the ego, a total insularity from the other, to be able to wall yourself off in a massive house with a big screen to watch Netflix for the rest of your live, with no-one to ""tell you what to do"" or ""how to live your life"".

There's a reason lottery winners always end up depressed. Because if you're given the ability to construct your life however you want, in the end, you realize that it is community that keeps you alive. It's human connection. The more you wall yourself off, the more you live in your head. And the more you do that, you aren't actually living in the world. 

So keep building those walls America, I'm going to have some friends over and have some fun."
2021-05-17 15:33,"Although I am fully vaccinated, I will continue to wear a mask most of the time in public and often outdoors just to stay healthy -  I did not catch a cold or any other illness once I started wearing a mask in April 2020 (though I did get a flu shot.) During the dusty spring winds of the high desert, my allergies were greatly diminished and my sinuses remained uncongested. No post-nasal drip! Wow!  My best friend gets a terrible sinus infection every winter that almost always turns into pneumonia but she did not get sick at all this year. I do believe that thorough hand washing and hand sanitizing when out and about  also contributed to my good health."
2021-05-17 14:55,"You could wear a raincoat inside your house at all times just in case it rains and there is leak.  It certainly wouldn’t matter to me, or affect anyone else, and I’d respect your right to do so. But it also wouldn’t be rational."
2021-05-17 15:34,"I'm fully vaccinated (75 years old) and so is my wife (chronic lung condition).  I haven't felt it necessary to wear a mask outdoors (we don't live in a densely populated area); she sometimes has for allergy-related reasons.

We are now happily entertaining fully vaccinated friends indoors without masks. We will continue to wear masks in indoor public spaces for an indefinite period for the following reasons: (1) There are a lot of unvaccinated people in our area, who can transmit the virus; (2) the ""breakthrough"" cases exist in extremely small numbers, but we don't want to be one of them (let's just add I'm not a Yankees fan); (3) the vaccines are excellent at preventing serious disease, but even mild disease can lead to ""long Covid;""  (4) while the vaccines appear to be handling current variants well, new variants will be created and spread worldwide, particularly given the many parts of the world that have very low vaccination rates, and some of those variants may escape current vaccine immunity; and (5) data on the duration of vaccine-created immunity, beyond 6 months, does not yet exist. 

An important additional reason for continued use of this health tool has nothing to do with Covid.  We have not had so much as a cold in the last 15 months.  Continuing to use masks and take other Covid-era precautions can reduce the probability of us getting what used to be thought of as regular, normal illnesses."
2021-05-17 15:35,All this fuss over a bit of fabric. So sad. The government mandates seatbelts to protect people from themselves. I do wish they had  mandated masks. Just think of all the lives that would have saved.
2021-05-17 14:39,Only in America would people cry about mask mandates infringing on their freedoms while attacking others exercising their freedom to wear one voluntarily.
2021-05-17 15:35,"Don’t get the virus. Do whatever you need to. I went through it, a fit healthy 52 year old.  It was a nightmare and I’m still not right, 10 weeks out."
2021-05-17 15:36,"Last summer, we were inundated by tourists as Jackson is a gateway to Yellowstone and Grand Teton National Park.  Teton County was allowed to have a mask mandate for this and other reasons.
The mask mandate has been lifted and I went out to breakfast for the first time since the Covid outbreak began. I did not wear a mask -  forgot it in the car. 
I have to admit I felt naked. Some people waiting for a table were wearing masks others not. I was in the grocery store this morning and everyone, myself included, was wearing a mask.  I'm not sure if the store still had a mask mandate or was everyone just accustomed to donning the mask?

I have to agree with others, the CDC guidelines have flip-flopped as we have been navigating this virus. It is hard to have confidence and it is a shame. 

For the time being, I will be wearing my mask in stores and waiting for tables in restaurants."
2021-05-17 15:37,"I work with the general public, in a business which attracts traveling visitors, and local families. 

I did not contract Covid this past year. I also didn’t get a single cold, or the flu. My seasonal allergy symptoms lessened enough that I could skip allergy medication in the daytime. 

I attribute my good health over this past year to wearing a mask. And if someone gives me grief over it, I’ll continue doing what I’ve done in the recent past; I’ll scowl at them under the secrecy of my face covering. 😷"
2021-05-17 15:37,"I understand the science, I also live in Florida, the leader in cases and variants. Oh, and vaccine holdouts. The vaccine I got is about 95% effective. I am not very worried, but I do think with so many people refusing to be vaccinated and spreading the disease, I'll keep my mask when facing the masses.

Today in Publix I was not alone, I saw only one person not wearing one."
2021-05-17 15:38,"It's common in many East Asian countries to wear one as a courtesy to their community, especially when one is sick. Only in the West is this such a dramatic, often times politically divided issue. If you're vaccinated, wear one or don't. If you're unvaccinated and mask free, I'm sure Covid will take care of your choices at some point. 

On a more shallow side, I enjoy matching my collection of beautiful masks with my outfits. It's also freeing as a woman to be able to go makeup/sunscreen free on lazier days. Or not having to deal with men telling me I need to smile more."
2021-05-17 15:39,"Masks do little to protect the wearer; they primarily protect other people, by reducing the viral load in the ambient air—air that we all breathe whether wearing a mask or not. 

That is a key point that is all too often overlooked in the mask controversy. Much to her credit, Ms. Nir, the author of this column, takes care to make this essential point."
2021-05-17 15:39,I have adapted Japanese protocol. A mask in crowded public spaces which has always been standard in Japan prior to the pandemic. Covid or no Covid it's common sense and courtesy.
2021-05-17 15:39,I have found a mask plus a face shield to be comfortable and protective and will community to wear both when mandated to return to the office.
2021-05-17 15:40,"I'll continue to wear a mask in indoor environments for the foreseeable future.  I see no reason not to.  As something of a germaphobe, most of the precautions we were advised to adopt (e.g., hand washing, using sanitizer, coughing into the crook of your arm, getting a flu shot, etc.) were things I already did.  Adding a mask to my repertoire was only a minor adjustment.  And despite being somewhat immune compromised, I am rarely ever sick. It works!"
2021-05-17 15:40,"I’ll continue to mask whenever I am indoors with people I do not know, even though I am fully vaccinated. And now that we know some of the vaccines are effective against the variants, I’ll go down to one mask instead of two. Honestly, wearing one doesn’t bother me anymore.

I’ll wear one in solidarity with those who cannot receive their vaccinations, such as children or those whose immune systems are compromised. I’ve been there myself. It’s a scary thing. 

For me, diligently wearing a mask has always been about protecting all people. I’m a little long in the tooth to change that about me now."
2021-05-17 15:41,"The problem with the new CDC guidance is not that it's wrong, but that no one wants to require proof of vaccination because ""freedom."" So states are uniformly removing mask mandates without regard to whether people are vaccinated or not. I think it's going to lead to another big spike.

Luckily, as a vaccinated person, my risk is low, but I worry about acting as a transmitter for people who can't get the vaccine. If we ever get to a point where enough people are inoculated, I'll happily discard my mask for nearly everything (flying or feeling ill being the exceptions). But, right now, it feels irresponsible to unmask in crowded indoor spaces knowing that half the people aren't vaccinated.

On the bright side, the overwhelming majority of my family and friends are vaccinated, so I can see them mask-free!"
2021-05-17 15:42,"I work for the American subsidiary of a Japanese company. Our Asia-based colleagues have ALWAYS worn masks on international flights, and also in the office for several days post-travel. This serves as both a courtesy to avoid catching and spreading any pathogens they encounter in their travels, and a means to maintain productivity. No one wants to be ill on a business trip. I think many Americans would do well to follow this example.

I plan to continue masking in several circumstances where it's not mandated. 
1. My 11 year-old niece will be vaccinated when she turns 12, but in the intervening months, I'm glad to mask up when we're together. Is it necessary? Probably not. But if she has to wear a mask, it's no biggie for me to wear one too so she's not the only one.
2. Masking helps a lot with pollen, so I'll wear one outdoors during allergy season.
3. Flu season? Even though I get an annual flu shot, I absolutely plan to mask in public. 

What a shame that masks ever became a contentious topic. As I said at the top, they've been routine in Asia since long before Covid."
2021-05-17 15:43,"My health is my responsibility, not the CDC's, so I will do what I think is necessary and right now, I do not believe we have turned the corner - there are too many unvaccinated people and too many variants out there. Even though Pfizer is 94% effective, that still leaves 6% and given the issues with long-haul Covid, wearing a mask for a few more months seems like a worthwhile precaution. Wearing a mask is only part of it though; I also don't go to restaurants and avoid crowds. I could care less what other people think of me. I am 70."
2021-05-17 15:45,"I do not understand why this is an issue. I am fully vaccinated but will continue to mask while indoors and especially after I return to campus. My university is not requiring vaccination of faculty, staff or students at the present time and is unlikely to do so prior to the beginning of the fall term. It is also unlikely that masks and distancing will continue to be required. I will continue to protect myself by wearing a mask. I do not wish to be part of some grand experiment to determine what happens when thousands of unvaccinated people are brought together without safety precautions. Avoiding my annual cold and minimizing my allergies are added benefits. I cannot and will not require my students to mask up in class. I am not yet certain if my office hours will be entirely virtual, or if I will require masks for face to face meetings. In any event, I am not harming anyone by continuing to wear a mask. In the unlikely event that I encounter anyone who has a problem with mask wearing, I will simply ask that they mind their own business and leave me alone."
2021-05-17 15:45,"The CDC is constantly misleading the public by using statistics generated  by math models, not test results.  Influenza deaths are seldom verified.  Only deaths of people 18 and younger require testing. The test aren’t accurate according to the CDC. Those confirmed youth deaths were between 40 to 180 a year in the last decade. Estimated adults deaths were between 15,000 to 60,000  a year.  
     Voila, the CDC changes how states fill out death certificates, and uses unconfirmed suspicions of Covid as the caused death.  If states used the previous “models”, half a million people died from the flu last year. 
     The CDC should report confirmed illnesses or deaths.  The idea for decades that flu deaths were reported (estimates) years after tweaking models is misleading. The public needed to know what is fact, and how estimates are made.  Last week, the NYT detailed how misleading a CDC outdoor Covid transmittal rate below 10% was.  Probably less that .001%, and questionable if cases were truly outdoors at all. Yesterday, over 700 epidemiologist disagreed with the CDC mask requirements. The CDC has lost credibility in the last 18 months, and its getting worse."
2021-05-17 14:56,"I have to question the legitimacy of this article. It seems like an attempt to “stir the pot” and fuel the insane polarization in this country. I know it got me riled up when I read it. I have severe allergies and while I’m fully vaccinated, I’ve been wearing my mask outside to keep my allergies under control. Do I think some of my neighbors believe I’m trying to make a “liberal point?” Of course, but who really cares what other people think? I’m just happy to be able to garden without misery. The real problem NYT should be investigating is not the perpetuation of the bullying and nonsense that have become the norm these days, but the root causes that have led Americans to be so divided...and what we may be able to do about them."
2021-05-17 15:46,Vivid isn't the only respiratory illness out there and I don't like any of them.
2021-05-17 15:33,"There is actually a psychological cost to masking, which most of these posters don't care about. I do care about the epidemic of depression and anxiety caused by social isolation, of which masking is a significant element. Be a little brave, people, and show your faces, smile at your neighbors, at the children in strollers just learning to be at home in the world. We shouldn't normalize OCD and become a society of hermetical germophobes. That's not good for anyone."
2021-05-17 15:08,"When the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and this newspaper together confirm that 80 percent of Americans have been fully vaccinated, I will start going out in public without my mask.  But like Mr. Jones in the story, I figure that it's kept me alive and healthy so far, so why change?  I can handle ugly looks and family pressure while I hold fast."
2021-05-17 15:47,"I am immunocompromised due to an autoimmune disease, and plan on wearing a mask and keeping my Covid precautions going indefinitely. My issue is the manner which the CDC suddenly changed their message, almost overnight. It is being challenged by nursing unions, public health officials, and many average citizens such as myself. There are variants as well, and when will the immunity from the vaccines end, leading to the need for a booster shot? Also, do you really think unvaccinated unmasked people will reveal their status? Probably not."
2021-05-17 10:37,"It would be more rational for Mr. Glickman to wear a helmet in the car than a mask after being infected AND vaccinated.  

Stress is also a concern- being in a constant state of alert is unhealthy."
2021-05-17 11:18,"Don’t care if you want to wear a mask for the remainder of your life just as long as your neurotic behavior doesn’t force me to wear one

I’ve been vaxed 

It’s a risk filled world

Good luck to ya"
2021-05-17 13:51,"I will continue wearing my masks for some time, especially given the super-spreaders and anti-vaxxers in the American population.  If I had a 'Star Trek'-type medical scanner that could tell me who is vaccinated and who is not, I might take my mask off in a restaurant.  Maybe in October."
2021-05-17 10:36,"“He has used this safety protocol for the past 14 months. It did not change after he contracted the coronavirus last November.”

Looks like his protocol failed.  

I’m vaccinated but I’ll keep wearing a mask in crowded public spaces during the winters.  First time in 20 years I haven’t gotten bronchitis."
2021-05-17 11:03,"I just put my children back in school after a year of virtual school. Within three weeks, my son contracted the first cold that anyone in our family had since the pandemic began. The surprise was that the cold resolved within 24 hours- the usually last a week or more. I attribute that to my son’s use of a mask and that he probably came into contact with a much lower viral load because he was wearing a mask (and, presumably because of the mask mandate, so was the person from whom he contracted the cold). We won’t continue to wear masks as often as we have, but I won’t get rid of them either."
2021-05-17 11:06,"One of the most important things I learned from getting COVID was compassion. Having a large amount of antibodies very early made me feel protected and relieved. While it was annoying that everyone constantly texted me articles about how we didn’t know if people could spread or be reinfected (true, back then), I always wore a mask even if I didn’t feel it was personally necessary for me. What took more effort for me to overcome was my frustration with my friends’ apprehension or disagreement as restrictions loosened. They hadn’t had it, and had a very rational fear of severe illness or long Covid, or of spreading to others. I tried to avoid complaining or pushing them to “relax”. 

Now, having been fully vaccinated plus a month, I am applying that lesson to maskers. While I absolutely think we should drop most indoor mask restrictions based on the CDC guidance and Sunday’s clarifying remarks that vaccinated people are at risk neither of spreading Covid nor severe illness or death from it, I have zero issue whatsoever with anyone wearing a mask. Beyond that this is NYC and it takes quite a lot for someone’s attire to raise an eyebrow generally, it does not hurt anyone if people decide to continue to wear a mask for their own protection, even indefinitely. You do you."
2021-05-17 11:14,"If the science says that the risk of transmission is low for vaccinated people, and the response is to attack and disregard the message, maybe we were never motivated by the science in the first place. I think wearing masks when fully vaccinated is just virtue signaling. I'm not saying people can't, but they should be honest about their motives."
2021-05-17 11:19,"I took a long drive yesterday from Nashville to Miami Beach. At both ends and all points in between, there was a mix that defied stereotypes of who would be wearing a mask and where. It did not look or feel like a contentious flashpoint anywhere. This is a non issue. To each his own in this case."
2021-05-17 15:02,"When you continue to wear a mask when your fully vaccinated it appears as if you don't trust the science and that you are UNvaccinated. Taking your mask off is an added benefit to the vaccinated. I believe that if vaccinated people don't trust that the vaccine works, why did they get it."
2021-05-17 13:08,"What is the “cost” of wearing a mask?  Well, it’s not zero.

1. Masks are filling up landfills like never before.  If you care about the environment, you may wish to reconsider about how many surgical masks and N95 respirators you will use up in a year.

2. N95 respirators are typically NOT designed to be worn for a 8  hours a day.  The respirators we purchase are usually designed for 1-2 hour work sessions.  There are respirators designed for 8 hours but those cost about $400 and most people are not wearing these.  They make breathing harder for many people which can in fact impact your health and oxygen blood level.  In addition, most people use their N95 respirators too often allowing bacteria and fungus to build up on the inside and then breath the “dirty” air they create.  This too can lead to ailments.

3. What happens when you cannot read a person’s facial expression?  Is there a value to seeing a person smile?  Or a frown?  Masks make us much less engaging, much less personable.  If anyone complains about how we have reduced our interactions to emojis and text messages, seeing each other through masks is not ideal.

Next time you think wearing a mask is harm-free and all positive, don’t be so sure.

People should apply common sense.  There is virtually no evidence that people catch and spread an airborne disease like Covid-19 outdoors when spread out more than 1-2 meters (about 3-6 feet) apart.  The disease is spread indoors, in poorly ventilated areas."
2021-05-17 12:05,I wonder if the masked and goggled gentleman was being “stared down” because it was assumed he was unvaccinated? Otherwise science tells us those precautions are unnecessary.
2021-05-17 13:48,"Let me say THIS, loud and clear, what I choose to wear, in the nature of clothing, jewelry, shoes, hats, or MASKS, is MY business, and MY business alone! Anyone and I do mean anyone who makes snide comments or attempts to shame me into removing my mask, is in for a very rude consequence!

I have had major lung related issues since I was 6 months of age. I’ve had Pleurisy, emphysema, severe asthma, flu, pneumonia , bronchitis, colds and viruses year after year, all my life, until this past winter. Since we came back to Canada in March 2020, and I started wearing my mask, I’ve contacted exactly ZERO, in the nature of communicable diseases!

I’m not stupid and can see the connection! So I will continue to wear my mask for my personal benefit, and if I do, ever come down with something that a cough or sneeze could pass to others, I will wear my mask as a courtesy to others so they don’t get sick!

Curtesy….a long forgotten word in the USA, and most certainly gone from the vocabulary of all those who believe they somehow have the right to tell me what I can or can’t wear because THEY don’t like it!"
2021-05-17 14:20,"I'm still masking for a long time- and yes, I'm fully vaxxed. You aren't alone!"
2021-05-17 15:51,Turns out that wearing an N95 mask outside helps me cut down on spring allergy symptoms and I also realize that there is way more dust in the city air now that the roads are busier again. I have no issues wearing the mask longer.
2021-05-17 15:51,"I am fully vaccinated but I have difficulty reconciling the CDC's mask guidance with the amount of COVID still in circulation. Nationally, we are still averaging over 30,000 cases per day and I live in a state still posting about 1,000 cases every day. 

During the depths of the pandemic people may have become accustomed to six figure counts of new cases every day - but 30,000 cases is still a lot of disease. 

I will be much more comfortable going maskless when case counts in my state are down to a few dozen. Then I will be confident I am protected by the vaccine *and* I will face little exposure to COVID in the community."
2021-05-17 12:12,"It drives me a bit nuts that some of the continuous maskers are treating masks as something that protects them. They don’t (unless you’re wearing an N95), they protect everyone else. I’ll wear a mask in crowded areas, but it’s next to pointless to wear it outside."
2021-05-17 15:52,"Of course, in America everything is politicized. But in Asia, people have been wearing masks for years. Some of the people, some of the time, at theIr own choice and for their own personal reasons, and no one thinks a thing about it. I think in this we should emulate Asia and stop making an issue of this."
2021-05-17 12:57,Ironic that the same folks berating others for not following science or listening to the CDC guidance are now not following science or listening to the CDC guidance. Our country is a nation of hypocrisy.
2021-05-17 13:00,"Dan Rather being “confused” of peoples’ mask wearing dismisses and avoids the fact of media induced alarm we’ve endured the past sixteen months.

Words like surge, battle, alarm, fear, fight, shots, jabs, threat, potential risk, potential harm, potential threat,” stay safe” instead “ stay healthy” messaging, hardly suggest calm responses.

Had the media presented “ vaccine inoculation”, “response mechanism, both personal and govt”, suggested people first find out if their antibody level is sufficient to prevent Covid, articles on ways to strengthen natural immunity, then people would be less panicked and reactive.

I hope Dan Rather accepts responsibility for any role he had in downplaying the psychology damage his profession created for the rest of us."
2021-05-17 10:22,"The science says that you’re safe if you’re vaccinated and take the mask off. The science says vaccinated individuals don’t spread it. The government says anyone who wants a vaccine can get one cost-free. These poor folks, by keeping their masks on, are saying they don’t trust the vaccine. They’re saying they don’t trust their neighbors to get it. They’re saying they don’t trust the science. My heart goes out to those living in fear around the clock - to an withering extent."
2021-05-17 15:52,"I'm with Dan Rather: what do I care if someone wears a mask because he feels safer?  But then I reflect that masks conceal one's identity; that's why robbers and assailants often wear them, and I become a bit doubtful."
2021-05-17 13:40,"Decades worth of actual studies and research showing mask ineffectiveness was thrown out the window in 2020 in exchange for feelings and anecdotes. The medical community has done society a grave disservice in going along with this charade. Masks don’t work against aerosolized viruses- they never have, and without significant improvement on current technology, they never will. 

I personally couldn’t care less whether or not people continue to wear their silly masks or not. What I do take issue with is the continued legitimization of mask wearing by the medical community as an effective form of infection mitigation. Any doctor that continues to prescribe mask usage to protect against Covid19, an aerosolized virus, is committing malpractice."

Now their expert advice is suddenly ""too soon.""  Cognitive Behavior Therapy on a mass scale is in order."
2021-05-17 10:54,"Bravo Mr.Glickman.  I agree with your attitude of caution and self-preservation.  Sadly, the  CDC has goofed before...I do not feel confident re: their latest enthusiastic message...it is reeking with dangerous prematurity and seeds mass  confusion, yet, once again,  in my professional opinion .  Time for the CDC to go back to school and study Public Health EDUCATION.  I will be wearing a mask as well...for a long time.

2021-05-17 10:55,"People wearing masks does not bother me. It’s the mandates that need to go.

Also do these people realize that masks does not protect the wearer from getting the virus? In order for masks to be effective you need most of the population in a given space to be wearing them. If you’re in a space with unmasked people and one of them has the virus you can still get infected while wearing your mask."

2021-05-17 10:25,I hope that people leave alone those who choose to wear the masks going forward but unfortunately our society has decided that shaming anyone and everyone publically for whatever a person disagrees with is now completely acceptable. Used to be the most one would get might be a bit of a stare for doing something different. Now it is open season to get up in someone's face or to yell at them.
2021-05-17 15:53,"This article ignores an important piece of the story. For millions of Americans who have weakened immune systems due to health conditions or medications that they are required to take (e.g., solid organ transplant patients), continuing to wear a mask is not a personal choice -- it's a necessity. Along with its guidance about unmasking, the CDC issued guidance that people with weakened immune systems may not be protected even if fully vaccinated, and may need to continue to exercise precautions (in other words, get vaccinated but act like you didn't). It's sad that the people who are most vulnerable and have been largely ignored in the public discourse about Covid, may get caught up in the crossfire of this politicized issue."

2021-05-17 11:48,"If people want to keep wearing masks obviously they should. But  the person mentioned in the article who has had the covid and later got vaccinated but  plans to continue to wear it for years is no more following the science than the covid deniers refusing to get vaccinated.  Now unlike them he isn't putting anyone else at risk.  But  across society many people continuing to wear mask forever would be a bad thing for everyone.  More and more people seems to prefer little or no interaction with others.  We can get everything delivered,  groceries, hot meals, current streamed movies.  Many can work from home.  A society with minimal interactions between  people not a health one.  It is one think to give masks a little more time, but every healthy person's goal should be to get to wear they don't feel the need to wear one."
2021-05-17 11:49,"With the cases dropping and vaccinations in place for about half the US population, could we be much closer to herd immunity than science thought? Many not vaccinated had the virus with or without symptoms and should also be immune. 

Might we be at or near 70 percent immunity ?"
2021-05-17 11:51,"Right now, a significant fraction of our population actually expects the rest of us to regard their feelings above all other considerations! They talk about wearing masks as if it somehow puts them in danger, maybe like, I don’t know...GUNS.

So I’ll make a deal with the anti-science crowd out there—I’ll throw away my mask if they throw away their guns. As dangerous as guns are, Covid-19 has proven to be at least 10X as dangerous."

It is a sad state in which our country finds itself that people will call you out for wearing a mask voluntarily. It is not the same as being called out for going maskless during COVID."

Live and let live when it does no harm to others.

With the new CDC advice, and my two doses of vaccine, I’ll be cutting back on frequency of wearing masks. But I’m pretty low risk. And when I get a cold or flu in the future I’ll wear a mask again."
2021-05-17 16:01,I believe that the CDC needs to post high virus warnings and tv should include in the weather report. If your area has low virus numbers then if you are vaccinated then forgo the mask. If your area has a high virus warning then it would be smart to wear a mask.  Logic; what a concept.
2021-05-17 16:01,"I'm fully vaccinated and delighted to be able to 
get together unmasked with vaccinated family and friends. But until a far larger percentage of the population is vaccinated, and we have a better understanding of variant/vaccine interaction, and there's more data on how long immunity lasts, I'm masking up when I'm in a crowded indoor space. At 75 I don't give a hoot what anyone thinks."
2021-05-17 16:01,"I’m probably gonna hold onto my masks. If cases are low and they’re no longer mandated, I won’t go everywhere with one, but I’m definitely gonna hold onto it especially in the winter months."

In fact, truthfully it does more than that to me...it really irritates and upsets me even though  I know it shouldn't. I see it as the flip side of those who refused to wear masks during the pandemic. It's doing something or not doing something because of a belief, unrelated to science, whether that belief is political nonsense, or now unreasonable fear. The number of cases is way,way down and the vaccines have been shown to be incredibly effective. WHY get a vaccine if you're going to double mask and continue to hide in your home? Is this how people really want to live?"
2021-05-17 16:01,"Got my 2nd Moderna over 3 weeks ago, but I continue to mask up, both outdoors and in. I'm 66, and have had pneumonia twice in the last 12 years (pre-covid).

While hospitalizations and deaths from covid are rapidly declining here in MA, they still are at levels HIGHER than when lockdowns and mask mandates began last year.

With this new CDC ""guidance"", many covid-deniers and anti-maskers (most of whom are also anti-vax) will simply keep on spreading the disease among the others who are un-vaxxed and unmasked, and occasionally infecting vaccinated people, too. This will potentially engender more harmful virus variants. Only now, they will be doing so by blending in with the vaccinated, and their irresponsible and anti-social behavior will no longer be obvious, thanks to the new widespread unmasking. 

In effect, the good actors are now providing cover for the bad actors.

Let's see what the numbers look like after a few weeks of this.  I will stop masking when after 2 weeks of a full Fenway Park (masked or not), the infection rate here stays low.

I will feel much more comfortable unmasking (even indoors) when covid hospitalizations and deaths return to near pre-pandemic levels, and when vaccinations reach a substantial majority."
2021-05-17 16:02,"It would actually be wonderful if people would wear masks when they are sick moving forward. It isn't something I had every considered until this year, but my family will be doing so out of consideration for everyone else. I hope others will too."
2021-05-17 16:02,"The CDC committed another unforgiveable blunder by further confusing the messaging to the American public regarding the requirement to wear a mask.  Their decision was very narrow and did not strategically support the ultimate goal of eradicating the covid 19 virus.  
Going forward, this is exactly what is going to happen; the vaccination rate in the US will top out at about 50%, because the ""no mask required"" direction will be interpreted by the ""anti-vaxxers"" as a green light to behave as though the virus is gone.  The US population will then consist of 2 buckets, 50% vaccinated and 50% unvaccinated.  Mutant strains will continue to circulate unabated in the unvaccinated bucket, and eventually evolve to defeat the vaccine, reentering the vaccinated bucket.  Thus, long term, were all hosed, because the CDC is clearly incapable of focusing on a strategic goal that takes into account the fundamentally selfish nature of 50% of America."
2021-05-17 16:03,"Whatever personal choices you are making or changing now about masks, this all is a great example showing how people’s choices are often not logical and rational, but are often based on feelings and habit and other things like appearances and wanting to belong to certain groups.

From 34K deaths a couple years ago down to less than 1K this season. An article in the Scientific American backs this up, and reports 22K deaths last season.  

And yet, select news outlets, politicians, acquaintances all question what was the efficacy of social distancing, WFH technology, lockdowns, masks?  

We might not know exactly to which degree each tactic worked on COVID, but it appears to this untrained statistician that the impact on the flu was tremendous... over 95% reduction in deaths?!  

Yet COVID still has taken over 500K lives (500 times more dangerous than the flu in a sense), imagine would could have been."
2021-05-17 15:58,"As we learn more and more about aerosols and how viruses like covid-19 and even the flu move about infecting people, wearing a mask in public doesn't seem unreasonable. Heck, some folk in Asia have been wearing masks to slow the spread of flu and colds for years. The decision on mask wearing should be left to the individual. (I might continue wearing my N95s.)"
2021-05-17 16:04,"I’d love to take my mask off eventually. Even though i’m fully vaccinated, there’s some part of me that is so terrified of things going wrong. It’s definitely a fear i’ll have to work through as things develop, but for now I still put my mask up when someone passes by out of courtesy."

2021-05-17 16:08,"Masks are probably one of the reasons there was no flu epidemic this year.   Not many people got colds either.  Frankly, who cares if a person continues to wear a mask after this pandemic is over.  They might be smarter than any of the rest of us recognize."

2021-05-17 16:09,"I'd say live and let live, and don't judge those who keep masking.  Some may have good reasons, like vulnerable people they live with, and some may be unreasonably fearful, but that's their business.  I just don't want the more conservative people to be negatively judging those who are following the science and CDC recommendations.

But now a Johns Hopkins study shows the vaccines provide little to no protection for solid organ transplant patients. The trouble with the new CDC guidelines is that lots of unvaccinated idiots will take off their masks. One of them eventually could kill my stepson due to their selfishness and stupidity. It makes me extremely angry at people who refuse to get vaccinated, especially when they are basing their decision on misinformation."
2021-05-17 16:10,I am vaccinated. And I will continue to wear my mask in some situations not because I am “paranoid” or “need therapy” (as one clearly lacking in empathy poster put it) but because no one can tell just by looking at me that I am vaccinated. Why make a restaurant or store employee wonder how much risk they might be taking or make a stranger worry that I might infect them or their child? I will continue to wear a mask as a considerate and respectful thing to do for others. We are citizens of a larger world and community. I wear my mask to respect that world. I wear my mask to respect you.
2021-05-17 16:10,"The Depression was a shock that changed the worldview of people who lived through it, and their kids.  You got a generation or more of people who wanted to pay cash, lived in horror of debt, and it wasn't really until determined effort from the credit card industry to put households into permanent debt again.

So we have people now who will continue to slow the spread of diseases that spread the way colds, the flu, and SARS-Cov-2 spread.  This isn't a problem.

If we maintain the change that allows anyone who wants to wear face covering then we'll also see a decline in the annual death toll from influenza each flu season.  We effectively skipped a winter of flu deaths this past year."

I read in Times recently some buildings plan to keep these protocols indefinitely because they make for smoother running of building. I plan to wear my mask indefinitely because it has been great as a pollen and cold/flu barrier and it is easy to pull it down when I feel I don't need it. I don't see why anyone else should care."
2021-05-17 16:13,"Whether I mask in stores and public buildings depends on the level of community transmission and which variants are present in my community.  If the public health system does not provide me with this information, I will mask in public spaces.  Currently, our community transmission is high, and no one is talking about variants. So, I mask. Alternatively, if we learn that vaccines protect against long Covid, and not just severe Covid, that would be a relief."
2021-05-17 16:13,"I'm not interested in wearing a mask forever, or even for another year if I don't have to. But it seems awfully early to be having this conversation. The pandemic is not over! New variants are rising, and most people are still not vaccinated against the originals. Public masking should remain the prudent default for now."
2021-05-17 16:14,"Really, Americans must not have to many important things to align over and to fight over,  if wearing or not masks are the key point of creating political factions. Almost embarrassing. sounds like kids in a playground fighting over anything."
2021-05-17 16:14,"I live in a very conservative rural area and I'd be very surprised if anyone asked me to take off my mask if I want to wear it.  If they did I'd just say that I'm undergoing chemo, which isn't true but it would remind them of the possibility.  A lot of conservatives are going to be conflicted because they haven't been vaccinated and they've been depending on the state mask mandate to allay their fears.  I think this will get some to get the shots.  Here, anyone who wants the vaccine has been able to get it for awhile and highly effective n95 masks are available so I'm not too concerned about people working in public places.  They can get vaccinated or wear an effective mask or both."
2021-05-17 16:14,Republicans insisted on making this a political rather than a health issue and aggressively advocated the spread of the disease by their actions and words.  And still do.  I don't expect them to be vaccinated or to wear a mask--they've made their intentions clear for a long time now.  Why would anyone trust them to do the right thing?  That's just the way it is.  There is no going back.
2021-05-17 16:17,its become quite clear that the CDC does not care for public health but only business and special interest lobby groups. The pandemic is not over. Vaccines are still not widespread and breakthrough infections have been documented. For the mask layer to be lifted so soon is premature and ill-advised.
2021-05-17 16:19,"As someone born immuno-compromised I plan to keep the mask on, at least in confined spaces (public transportation, classrooms, work etc). I do plan to take it off outside in the open air though. All my life I've known what it's like to be weaker than the average person and to have an immune response that is not as strong as the average person- I've experienced being in the ICU on the cusp of death, most people have not. I'm not playing around with coronavirus, the flu, the common cold or any other bug, especially in a country like America where people only care about themselves and their own hubris and delusions. And if anyone tries to confront me in public about it I'm also prepared for that too: PEPPER SPRAY."

2021-05-17 16:24,"I went to a large kosher market yesterday to purchase some specialty items and was appalled at the number of people (including many young children) walking around without masks.  The CDC makes guidelines, not mandates.  How can a parent, in good conscience, think it's appropriate to have their children in enclosed spaces without any kind of protection?  I will wear a mask wherever and whenever I feel it is appropriate and wish that others would stop and think about how their selfishness has added to the issues we've faced over the past 16 months."
2021-05-17 16:24,"Over the past year, we have witnessed our fellow Americans hoard household items, refuse to wear masks, ignore orders against large social gatherings and unnecessary travel, lie to get vaccinated sooner, refuse to get vaccinated despite being physically able, and behave rudely and/or hatefully towards others who disagree with them. We heard our public health authorities actively discourage the use of masks, deny airborne transmission, and underestimate asymptomatic contagion far too long after ample evidence was available. Of course that's going to shake people's trust in others and in health authorities.
I'll be fully vaccinated this week, and it pains me to say I will still be wearing a mask indoors at all times, even if it's not required. I would love nothing more than to take it off. I miss seeing people smile. I miss mouthing smthg silly to a friend. I miss sampling at the cheese counter. 
But really, what I miss most is trust. Trust that people will wear a mask indoors if they're not vaccinated or feeling sick. Trust that people who can get vaccinated will do so. Trust that my immune system responded as expected to the vaccine, because there is no reliable commercially available test yet. Trust that our authorities will set and enforce adequate indoors ventilation standards, and financially assist businesses in implementing ventilation measures. Trust in our medical system if I catch covid.
Restore trust, and watch masks all but disappear."
2021-05-17 15:36,"With all due respect to Mr. Glickman, if he used an N-95 mask and goggles and still got COVID, his infection control practices need fine tuning."
2021-05-17 16:25,"I think we are fast reaching a point where it's time for masks to become a personal choice. The justification for requiring them has always been to protect others, but today, there are other ways for people to protect themselves than having everyone in the room wearing masks. Between wearing their own masks and getting vaccinated, that seems good enough.

Since getting vaccinated, I have become much less judgmental of people who do not wear masks indoors, and also try to avoid being judgmental of people who wear masks unnecessarily outdoors.

There are plenty of non-COVID reasons for occasionally wearing a mask outdoors, such as pollen, air pollution, or even sun protection. I myself have even put one on a cold winter day, just to keep my face warm, even though there was nobody around and I do not normally wear a mask when walking down the sidewalk.

A little bit of civility towards others can go a long way."
2021-05-17 16:28,"I'm with Mr. Glickman 100%.   My ""obsessive"" mask wearing has been earning me scoffs and side-eyes for months and, well, I'm used to it.

I’m either protected or I’m not, and if I am, then who cares?  That’s on them at this point.  Vaccines are readily available, and I think it’s obscene that people would expect that we would wear these things even though we’re fully protected.  I’m sorry if you’re immunocompromised, but it’s not realistic to think that the rest of the country is going to live our lives behind a mask until the world gets to Zero COVID.

Every sinus infection I get requires weeks of treatment and feeling terrible. Not having to deal with that has been a gift. 

I am truly baffled by resistance to masks. They're a completely common thing in Asia, where people wear them to protect themselves or others from contagious illnesses, or from allergens. I truly do not understand why anyone wearing a mask triggers anger in someone not wearing a mask. Once mask requirements get dropped, anyone wearing a mask is choosing to do so. Just like some people choose to wear white spandex leggings, pajamas in public during the day, too-tight t-shirts with the sleeves cut off, or other questionable fashion items I would, personally, rather not see. If I don't get a vote on whether or not people get to wear t-shirts that are so small their bellies hang out the bottom, they don't get a vote on whether or not I wear a mask to protect myself from minor (or major) illnesses."

If you want to wear a mask in an office, go ahead, but don’t use your predilection to do so as an argument for working from home, where you presumably would enjoy the convenience of not wearing a mask, or for encouraging the vaccinated to wear masks in an office. Also, wearing a mask for your own protection has NEVER been the primary—at least, scientific—reason for wearing masks. Although the mask may make you feel safer, that feeling is not science on which we should base guidelines for the public generally."
2021-05-17 16:34,"I didn’t have a cold or the flu this past year.  Mask wearing, being much more aware of correct hand washing, removing my outdoor shoes upon entering my house, social distancing and just in general not being around lots of people have kept me well.  I do want to go back to concerts, plays and other group activities just not sure how to handle them.  The best case scenario would have everyone possible vaccinated and wearing a mask if they must be out when not well or, better yet, just staying away from others until they feel better in general.  I learned a lot about public health from this pandemic and am much more cautious and respectful of the power and insidiousness of disease causing germs."
2021-05-17 16:35,"20 years ago, I would put on a mask once I got in my seat on an airline. I wanted to put it on earlier, but felt conspicuous. (No one ever said anything.) If I didn't wear one, I would get bronchitis in a few days. Once I wore one, I didn't get sick with air travel. I got the idea to wear the mask upon seeing on TV that Asians commonly wore masks for smog and better health. I also get sick from shopping in holiday crowds, so I will wear a mask when it makes sense, to prevent seasonal flu & illness."
2021-05-17 16:36,"I guess the underlying question is ""what's the bad thing that would have happened, if the CDC had simply said 'vaccinated or not, you don't need to mask up outdoors any longer, but people should still keep them on indoors in public places until their community reaches 70% vax, then everyone can take them off.'  that way, everyone could have been on an equal footing, and the level-of uncertainty  of whether the other person on line at the supermarket is actually fully-vaccinated or just doesn't want to wear a mask, would have been eliminated. ( at least to the extent that, at that point, it would no longer make any difference.)"
2021-05-17 16:35,"It's unfair to expect consistency from CDC guidelines.  Initially they know nothing about the virus as it's a new one and the guidelines were simply based on flu guidelines as a default.  It's not the flu and as data has poured in, the guidelines have had to change.  The situation on the ground is always changing as well.  Initially there weren't enough masks even for health care workers for instance and there's been the continuing threat of overwhelming hospitals.  Science isn't magic.  In a situation like this one the science is changing rapidly, the situation is changing rapidly, and so must the guidelines."
2021-05-17 16:37,"At this point, wearing a mask for me is like a habit.   I didn't get sick over the winter and it has helped during allergy season here.   I'll probably take it off in a few weeks, but I am in no hurry.   That said, parents were all mask-less at soccer games this weekend, so I stuck out a bit.   After I clear two weeks post my second shot, and allergy season is over, I'll ditch it."
2021-05-17 16:36,"I have no plans on stopping the use of masks when in confined spaces.

Other than food poisoning, I have not been ill or sick since January 2020.  I attribute a large portion of that to not being forced to sit in meetings with or be forced to interact with people that refuse to cover their cough and insist on showing up to work even when they have a fever, coughing fits and a river of post nasal drip."
2021-05-17 16:36,"I am fully vaccinated and will continue to wear a mask indoors until we've hit at least 90% vaccination. As long as we are below that threshold because the anti-intellectual crowd refuses to get it, the virus will continue to mutate, and there is a good chance that it will eventually be unaffected by the vaccine, and we'll have to start this all over again."
2021-05-17 16:39,"I am a gardener and have for years suffered from allergens after working in the yard. It never occurred to me to wear a mask until Covid. In the last year, I have not had one allergy attack after working in the yard since I wear a mask. I also have not had a cold in the last year and I give credit to my masks. I will continue to wear my mask when around others in a small space. And I too don't care one bit what anyone thinks or says. All of the those who stare and make comments to those of us who will continue to protect ourselves need professional help."
2021-05-17 16:40,"I just got my 2nd shot, but I'll be double masking inside places until I feel comfortable enough when the published vaccination rate is 70% in my area.  I was only planning on wearing one mask after being fully vaccinated, but due to the new ""guidance"" and knowing how human behavior is with those that are not vaccinated not wearing masks, I'll be double masking instead of single.  Thanks CDC!"
2021-05-17 15:36,"Thankfully, there was no flu season to speak of this year.  Masks and social distancing helped.  Not a big deal to wear one with the bonus of lowering my risk for contracting various nasty bugs floating around.   Remember to wash your hands too."
2021-05-17 16:41,"The CDC guidance may well backfire - my personal belief is it is likely to backfire. We might get through the summer but the 2021 holiday season could be problematic. 

Dr. Walensky may be making a terrible mistake, confusing “scientific data” with real-life behavior. We were doing fine - there was no need to rush."
2021-05-17 16:45,"Just remember, the University of Washington school of medicine used excess mortality stats to calculate 900,000 deaths in a recent study, rather than the just 600,000+ that is the current worldometers figure (checked today).

I expect we're all going to hear a lot about that sometime.

It may be time to do away with masks it may not be.

But coronavirus was a very bad threat.  And many leaders really bobbled the ball.  It looks like the USA was one of the worst countries at fighting the virus."
2021-05-17 16:45,"Having pictures taken with a mask is awesome - I don't have to smile! 

I'm vaccinated, and I don't see myself not wearing a mask in the subway or on a plane ever again.  How did I ever let other breathe on me in a crowded subway during flu season?"
2021-05-17 16:45,I’ll never be in an airport or airplane again without a mask. My spouse & I have not had a cold or any other illness since we started wearing masks. Why should anyone care if I wear one at Kroger or to go into a crowded restaurant? I now know how defiant folks are when it comes to to vaccinations & health. There’s no going back to my naïveté.
2021-05-17 16:45,"Actually, it's pretty nice to have had nothing other than allergies this past year.  Masks deserve credit for that, along with social distancing and finally the broad acceptance of remote work.  Only the lesser-educated members of a certain right-leaning political party are trying to make it political."
2021-05-17 16:46,"I honestly really like wearing the mask in public. I feel safer with regard to my health, and as a trans guy, I have an added bonus of being able to pass better with it on so I feel less vulnerable to running into someone who would treat me poorly for being trans."
2021-05-17 16:31,In 2019 there were 45 million cases of the flu. In 2020 there were 2000. Enough said
2021-05-17 16:47,"It’s going to be awhile before I feel safe enough to shop in a grocery store. I’m glad that the outdoor farmer’s markets are open once again, but I’m just not ready to brave the indoor masses. I’ve stopped wearing my mask at drive-thru windows and at curbside pickup because I’m vaccinated, but given that I live in a very Trumpy area, I’m not going to feel safe with a mask on in a store because I feel like it might make me a target of a deranged someone who injects Tucker Carlson into his veins. To these people who plan on continuing to wear masks, I wish you safety."
2021-05-17 16:48,"I admire these people for their determination to stick with mask-wearing but, sadly, I have a feeling that after a while the feeling of being the 'odd man out' will result in them removing their masks for good."
2021-05-17 16:49,And how about the pollution or particulate matter that set off asthma and allergies?  I am not coughing as much after being outside even if my eyes still water and itch.
2021-05-17 16:49,"It’s time to expand the CDC’s director role to be more than just a gatekeeper for health science and pharmaceutical approvals, more than just an arbiter of peer-reviewed studies, especially in the midst of a nasty global pandemic.  

Take a cue from the organizational change and communication departments of large global enterprises.
All official communications can be viewed from the perspective of senders and receivers. Unfortunately senders and receivers often don't participate in a true dialogue at the onset of a change. They talk right past one another. 

Imagine a people manager who sits down with an employee to discuss a major organizational restructuring project. The manager shares the information in an enthusiastic and positive way. She covers all the key messages, including the business reasons for change, the risk of not changing, and the urgency around changing the structure for competitive reasons. If a people manager spends too much time talking about the business and not enough time talking about the implications to the employee then much of the key business information communicated by the people manager to the impacted employee in this first conversation goes unheard. Why? The message is overshadowed by the employee's concerns about job security and fear of change.

The CDC needs a change management department."
2021-05-17 16:49,"The CDC was late to announce the recommendation to wear face masks...well after most reasoning people had already decided it was prudent to wear a mask. Now, while there remains evidence of robust community-spread, vaccination percentage lower than herd immunity level, children unable yet to be vaccinated and aspects of the virus mutations are unknown...the CDC says vaccinated people can unmask...with no way to differentiate. It does not make sense."
2021-05-17 16:51,"There is a valid justification for wearing masks, avoid catching colds and flu, reduce the inhalation of pollution, pollen, molds, toxins, and other airborne threats. It's similar to wearing condoms; an ounce of prevention is worth a  pound of cure ;-)

As for those who are upset, they will be upset no matter what. It's no wonder that despite the national health costs, Americans are one of the least healthy populations, with irreverence for prevention."
2021-05-17 16:51,"I do not know a single scientist who agrees with what the CDC  just did. And, I know a lot of scientists; myself included.  Many agree that the mask guidelines should be gradually changed but not so abruptly, with so little evidence, with dubious reasoning, and poorly communicated."
2021-05-17 16:52,"A lot of people focus solely on safety, and make comments like ""there's no harm to anybody if I wear a mask."" I disagree completely,.

It's true that if you are immunocompromised, then wearing a mask may well be necessary for some time. However, for the ~96% of people who are not immunocompromised and not visibly ill, then wearing a mask is inherently anti-social behavior that is incompatible with civil society. 

Think back to late 2019 (PCE?). How do you think you would have felt then if you walked outside and 1/2 of the population was wearing a mask? I bet that most of you would have felt a bit creeped out; I know that I would have.

Now that we are basically at a point in the Covid cycle when the risk has declined to something like the regular flu (which typically kills 30-50,000 people annually), I think that we need to get back to being maskless ASAP. 

Humans have evolved to carefully observe facial expressions for signs of danger, hostility, happiness, love, etc. Our entire culture is built on socialization, and that can't really happen fully with masks on."
2021-05-17 16:52,"I proudly stand with Joe Glickman.

For the past 15 months I've been free of colds and the flu. I would like to keep it that way and if it means wearing a mask then so be it.

Me wearing a mask costs others absolutely nothing, in fact, it's to their benefit so I don't know what the problem is."
2021-05-17 16:53,"I think in a country such as the US that encourages people to go to work when sick (because they don’t get paid sick leave or other ‘corporations first’ reasons) it makes sense to normalize the use of masks. I’m certainly going to continue using mine on the subway, especially during cold and flu season."
2021-05-17 16:53,"Lets face it, what people really like in these overexposed times is the anonymity that masks provide. A lot of people were uncomfortable in public even before being continuously a click away from internet ignominy, so its definitely calming being able to go around in disguise. Going forward, mask wearing will rarely be about medical safety, for better or worse its really about opting out."
2021-05-17 15:34,"Living in Houston, TX near the world-famous cancer center, one often saw people wearing masks in public long before the pandemic. It seems reasonable to assume many of them were either undergoing treatment, or suffering illness and needed protection from any type of infection. Are those people to now be ""shamed"" for wearing a mask, by apparently unimaginably ignorant Karens and rightwingers? How incredibly dumb can people be?

It seems to be a simple statement: If someone wishes to wear a mask, that is their business...the same as deciding what color clothes they choose, what hairstyle or type of shoes. It is no-one else's business. I will choose to associate with someone who is actually considerate enough to wear one; but that's a term completely foreign to far too many Americans."
2021-05-17 16:55,"I’ve dutifully worn my mask since the science indicated that it was the wise thing to do, and I’m still deciding what the transition to not masking looks like for me now that I’m vaccinated. So, I’m certainly not anti mask, and I’m not going to judge those folks if they decide to live the rest of the lives in them (though that’s too paranoid for me).

However, I will judge those, like the teacher who wants kindergartners to wear masks forever, who seek to impose their paranoia and trauma on others. It makes sense for the kids to be in masks until they can be vaccinated, but there is no reason for masking to continue after that point. Moreover, those kids NEED to be exposed to the germs the teacher fears. Those illnesses are effectively training their immature immune systems. It’s a critical phase of their physical development. By arguing for depriving the kids of that early exposure, she is prioritizing her fear over their needs. That is never going to be okay."
2021-05-17 16:55,"I have lung issues, and at times struggle to breathe behind a mask. I shudder to think what I'd feel like if I stopped wearing it and caught the flu, or covid. For now, I'm wearing a mask in public."
2021-05-17 15:08,"We know that masks are an effective defense against COVID-19.

We know that Pfizer and Moderna are safe and effective vaccines against COVID-19.

We know that Republicans aka the white European American voting majority don't agree nor care about any facts or science regarding either masks or vaccines with respect to COVID-19.

We know that 64% of Americans are not fully vaccinated against COVID-19 and 53% haven't received one vaccine dose.

We know that  America is first in the world among nations with regard to COVID-19 infections and deaths."
2021-05-17 16:40,"Anti-maskers and anti-vaxxers are mostly the same people. Thus, you will never be able to distinguish those who lie about their status from those who are truly vaccinated.
As the anti-vax/maskers are also proving to be anti-government and white supremacist, we know they have no desire to stand up and be counted ( i.e. no honor), thus the only way to protect yourself is to continue wearing a mask, or instituting some form of vaccine passport."
2021-05-17 16:58,"It is fascinating to watch human behavior.  Particularly when confronted with a ""switch"" in social signals.

Walking down Second Avenue this morning I still saw many (most?) people still dutifully wearing their masks.

My instincts told me that these were the ""smart folk"" who've been wearing masks all along and are more likely than not to now be vaccinated.

And, indeed, until a couple of days ago they and I were dutifully following then current CDC guidelines by wearing a mask.

But those guidelines have just done a 180 degree about face!

Now, vaccinated folks do not need to wear masks -- at least not when simply walking down the street.

So I'm left with the social dilemma.  When I see a mask-wearing person walking down the street is she or he telling me she or he isn't vaccinated?

After all, that's what current CDC guidelines advise.

Or am I now being subjected to some kind of wrongly-placed social shaming because I, being fully vaccinated, have chosen to follow the guidelines and remove my mask?

Weird, huh?"
2021-05-17 16:57,"I won't judge those who want to still wear a mask in public (although two masks and a pair of goggles seems like a bit of overkill). However, as someone who is fully vaccinated and will soon be shedding the mask in most public places, my hope is that folks still choosing to wear a mask don't think I'm being selfish and wag the finger at me for not wearing one. Either we trust the science or we don't. And the science says that the vaccine is anywhere from 75-95% effective in preventing COVID-19, and it's highly effective in preventing the spread of the disease. At this point, the vaccine IS my mask. I had no problems wearing the mask when it was our only means of slowing the spread. Now, the vaccine is way more effective than any piece of cloth that I put on my face. 

And look, if a business still requires masks, I'll still comply without complaint. I'll probably wear masks during cold and flu season since I went through this winter without getting a cold. But I'm not going to go to the beach or out for a walk on an 85-degree day and put a hot mask on if the scientific community no longer believes that I need to. And as this mask issue has become so contentiously partisan, we need to recalibrate what it means to choose to wear (or not wear) a mask in public as this pandemic winds down. So I won't judge these people, but please don't judge me if the bottom half of my face is showing."
2021-05-17 16:58,"I think this NYT article about a backlash against people who still mask is an attempt at stirring the pot.  I’m fully vaccinated, but I’m still wearing my mask in grocery stores, etc.  So, does everyone else in my region of California.  Nobody harasses anybody.  Because of this poorly coordinated and executed decision by the CDC, our state and county health officers have not had time to digest the new guidelines.  I can wait.  Better late than sorry."
2021-05-17 14:49,"I don't enjoy wearing a mask.  I enjoy seeing people wearing masks with naked nostrils much less.  My trust in the 'Merkan Peepul, too many who refuse to be vaccinated, to continue (to start?) wearing masks because they have not been vaccinated is the bridge too far for me.  I'd say we just created a new class of liars, but it has simply morphed.

I will continue to avoid crowds, airplanes, and wear a mask in the grocery store.  Leave me alone, I'll die soon enough."
2021-05-17 15:15,"To those people heaping ridicule upon the masked......the response can be ""You felt it was your right to NOT wear a mask because it infringed on your personal freedom.  Now I'm exercising my personal freedom TO wear a mask."""
2021-05-17 17:01,"I have no problem if people want to wear masks however long for whatever reason. You do you.

However, I’m fully vaxxed and comfortable not wearing one, I trust the data that shows they are incredibly effective at preventing infection, illness, and transmission and I’m ready to stop wearing mine unless/until the data changes.

For those long term maskers, I hope you can work on your silent (and not so silent) judgement of those that are ready to go maskless. You can live your life as you feel most comfortable, but at the moment the data is on our side so you can’t insist the rest of us cater our choices to your comfort.

I am willing to wear a mask if I feel sick, but only if I just can’t stay home and I will not be wearing one all winter long, just in case."
2021-05-17 17:01,"I think if the CDC was more professional and measured in its communications, some of this would be avoided.   Haven't they heard of things such as setting targets, following metrics, managing expectations, consistent messaging, etc.?

They could have come out with something like this:

""Based on current research and trends, once the USA has achieved certain metrics, the CDC will recommend relaxing mask recommendations.  Specifically, once the 14 day average of daily new cases is below 25,000, 45% of the country is fully vaccinated and 55% has had at least one shot, then we will relax the mask mandates. ""

Then, if desired or at a late date, they could also add

 ""Based on current trends, we anticipate the USA will reach these targets by the end of June and we should be able to celebrate the United States of America on July 4 without masks.""

Instead we get these surprise pronouncements which sow chaos and discord."
2021-05-17 16:58,"Yes, what I am starting to fear is being harassed by right wing extremists, not getting sick."
2021-05-17 17:02,"All masks are not equal.  Maybe some people would feel better wearing the PAPR respirator helmet pack that my nurse daughter wears in the ICU. 
From closing playgrounds to spraying everything with chemical disinfectants, there’s been a lot of wrong and harmful detours in the coronavirus decisions. 
If people want to keep wearing cloth masks after they are vaccinated, fine. But be realistic. Cloth masks aren’t that effective with viral aerosols. 
Children need to play and see faces and see smiles."
2021-05-17 17:02,"While I can understand the worry, I think there might be a danger here of overdoing the mask thing - if you wear a mask all the time in public you are never being exposed to the kinds of daily germs that human beings normally are exposed to. Wouldn't this lead to weakening of your immune system over all, if it never gets a chance to do its job? Or even lead to autoimmune issues if the under-used immune system starts turning on its own cells? 

We are adapted to be exposed to germs and contagions from other humans on a regular basis. If we remove this from our environment it could cause bad consequences down the road (we already know that growing up in a hyper clean environment can lead to development of allergies as another example).

We really can't hide from the world if we expect to have a healthy relationship with it (in more ways than one)"
2021-05-17 15:50,I will wear a mask whenever I deem it necessary. Period. Couldn't care less what others say or think.
2021-05-17 17:03,"Being fully vaccinated, I will shed my mask if the state of Illinois lets us.

However, I may don it for certain occasions, ie international air travel.  I may also wear it during flu season for certain events, large noisy crowds, etc.  And wash my hands often.  And social distancing as much as possible.

But I will NOT give up my life."
2021-05-17 16:28,"I am deeply disturbed I find myself in complete agreement with Dan Rather.  It seems people are more preoccupied with wearing masks than, say, open carry laws.   Clearly people do not have enough to occupy their time nowadays."
2021-05-17 16:24,"No problem at all with people who opt to continue wearing a mask after vaccination. 

But, the science is very clear: after vaccination your personal risk of becoming sick from covid and your chance of passing covid to others is negligible, practically zero. 

So, folks who continue to wear masks are being unnecessarily paranoid. That’s objective fact, if you believe in science."
2021-05-17 17:03,"I am concerned that un-vaccinated individuals will stop wearing masks and claim that they have been vaccinated. This seems like a great opportunity for the virus to spread.

I am not in the least afraid of continuing to wear a mask."
2021-05-17 17:04,"If the schools open normally for children in the fall, people can wear masks in perpetuity and I could care less.  I've been *kindly* coaxing friends and relatives to take their masks off outside (extremely low risk!) to help symbolize confidence in the vaccines and also so, if people are trying to play it conservative re: their personal risk, they understand where mitigations are worth it.  That Coronavirus is primarily an indoor airborne disease can not be said enough.  My work is still wiping surfaces people don't even touch!   

I really hope that as hospitalizations and deaths continue to plummet in the US because of these AMAZING vaccines we can return to normal.  If there are a few hold outs, that's fine!  Take your time!  I'm not mad!  Fauci and the CDC say that vaccinated adults can go back to normal, so I'm taking them at their word.  Unvaccinated people, please please get vaxxed, so we can have normal school for children in the fall."
2021-05-17 16:18,"Let folks be. If they want to wear a facemask what is it to you? NOT wearing a facemask may have put you in danger when it was necessary, but the converse is not true."
2021-05-17 17:05,"What isn't explicitly being said is that the vaccinate can take off their masks and potentially get covid - but without severity or (hopefully dying).  I personally would rather not get it at all and will continue to mask indoors unless vaccine passports are implemented in establishments (which is never going to happen).  Also, I share Dan Rather's confusion - why does anyone care if i wear a mask???"
2021-05-17 17:05,"It's still a pandemic, and its future course is unknowable.  Given what we do know, it is reasonable for vaccinated people to take off their masks, but given what we don't know it is also reasonable to keep them on."
2021-05-17 17:05,"One thing I can say about this year of masks, as a doctor, the rate of winter time colds and flus dropped dramatically. I usually spend the time between December to February either prescribing antibiotics or else cough medicine several times a day, and I barely had to do any of that this past year."
2021-05-17 17:06,"It was wrong for the CDC to lift the mask requirements so soon, and will lead to an increase in cases....and then another mandate to wear masks....which most intelligent citizens will continue to do with or without being vaccinated."
2021-05-17 17:06,"Your mask didn't keep you healthy last year. Your mask, home schooling, closed restaurants, no flying, no family holidays, no fans at sporting events, no broadway shows, no movies, remote work, grocery delivery, outdoor dining, no dating, no bars, no worship services, hand washing, and a host of other changes in behavior that aren't going to last kept you healthy. Get vaccinated."
2021-05-17 17:07,"It has become clear to me that many people just want to argue about anything/everything.  Back in the day, if one made a personal choice such as continuing to wear a mask or some other trivial decision, people may think that they are being overly cautious, or perhaps intelligent especially if they are elderly or immune compromised or whatever. Nowadays everything is up for argument.  I don't know who wants to spend their precious time on this earth in this manner.  Perhaps it is an expression of depression for those who need something to give them that jolt of an ""upper"" by joining in something to fight against.  At any rate, it's gotten quite tiresome. I am not interested in all made up controversy and will save my time, attention and energy for truly important matters, of which there are many."
2021-05-17 17:07,"I am vaccinated and I am keeping my mask on.  Here is why:
1.	 Even the best Covid vaccines are 95% efficient, not 100%.  Vaccine breakthrough has happened.  With my advanced age and pre-existing conditions, I am at risk for serious disease.  
2.	I have removed my mask indoors when dining with vaccinated friends, but when I enter public places, I have no guarantee that the unmasked people nearby are also vaccinated or simply people who think the coronavirus is a hoax and who refuse to be vaccinated.  According to your newspaper only 37% of the population are fully vaccinated.  I would love to remove my mask someday when a majority of the population is vaccinated, but when will that ever happen?"
2021-05-17 16:37,Curious that Mr. Glickman feels safe in the masks and goggles when they did not prevent him from contracting coronavirus in November.
2021-05-17 15:49,"I intend to keep wearing a mask for an indefinite period of time.  Even though I have received both doses of the Moderna vaccine, there *are* variants of the Corona virus circulating.  And I don't trust fools who go into places which *still* say wearing a mask is required (like my supermarket) and who AREN'T wearing a mask; these people deserve to be ejected, and should not be serviced, because they put *everyone* at risk: the poor employees, and other patrons. Wearing a mask doesn't both me a bit, and have to wonder about the mental stability of people who say masks are ""infringing on their liberty.""  Show me where in the Constitution you are granted the freedom to be a public health menace."
2021-05-17 16:59,"I think the guidance to stop wearing masks indoors in public is premature and eerily reminiscent of the early days of COVID. And relying on the honor system is reckless with so many COVID denying, anti-maskers out there. I will wear mine until COVID 19 is a distant memory."
2021-05-17 16:17,"Perma-Masker - Count me in.  Did not get sick since February
2020.  Also, hand washing all the time."
2021-05-17 17:10,"I am and will continues wearing the mask.  I feel the need of double masks too, as there is people around me thinking they do not need wearing masks.  My kid has no problem with the mask either, hope her school will continue to have all students in masks."
2021-05-17 17:10,I have been fully vaccinated and intend to stop wearing a mask when my province lifts the mandate. But I don’t see the big deal if others want to continue wearing masks. That’s their business.
2021-05-17 16:01,Ironic that a year ago people rejected masks requirements in the name of personal liberty. Now those people are mad that others refuse to take their masks off because they are exercising their personal liberty.
2021-05-17 17:11,"I blame the CDC for not accurately portraying how incredibly effective these vaccines are until last week, and vastly overemphasizing the effectiveness of masks. 
They need to work extra hard now. Continuing to wear a mask isn't always just a harmless exercise. It also shows how many people have developed pretty serious anxiety disorders."
2021-05-17 15:54,"If the last five years have informed us of anything, it's that a large segment of the population is willing to cheat to get their way. Do you really think all of those who claim to be vaccinated to go maskless in public, actually are? Not on my life!"
2021-05-17 17:11,"Why should anyone, myself included, who decide that we want to keep masking in public - around strangers! - be facing any backlash? I can still get COVID, even though vaccinated. I don't care if it's not as serious a case: I DO NOT want to get COVID, period."
2021-05-17 16:21,"Gah! I am still wearing a mask, but this is important:

While using two cloth masks or a surgical mask and a cloth mask to double mask can be effective, N95s are not meant to be used with
other masks, and doing so will reduce their effectiveness.

Because N95s are designed with higher filtration capacity and to be more airtight, putting another layer on top of them will trap moisture and reduce their capacity to protect.

Tl;dr:

It's OK to double mask certain models, but you have an N95, do not add another mask on top!"
2021-05-17 16:34,"I love my mask, it's my ""Anti Aging"" mask, my ""No Makeup"" mask. Such freedom, who knew! I can yawn when I am talking to boring people and they don't even know.  Yeh, along with less traffic, this Pandemic has offered some real positives in my opinion."
2021-05-17 17:12,"Fully vaxxed with Pfizer since 3 weeks ago but I still wears a mask — mostly to annoy the Trumpistas in the building.

Every time they approach in the buildings public spaces, I theatrically put on my mask, as if they are walking allergens, which they really are."
2021-05-17 17:12,"Relieved to see others thinking the same way as I did. 
We will keep the masks on until the science on vaccine and how it prevent COVID variants are more finalized."
2021-05-17 15:56,"I've long admired Fauci. He led us through the AIDS epidemic. 

I heard a couple of virologists on TWIV agreeing that, yes, Fauci lied when he told people early in the epidemic, during the shortage of masks, that they weren't necessary if you weren't a medical professional. He shouldn't have done it. 

Then I heard Fauci say that you should decide to wear masks based on your ""individual"" assessment of personal risk. (It's not the personal risk, it's the community risk that matters.) 

I thought of Goethe's Faust: 

Villager: There goes the good Doctor Faust. He and his father saved our lives during the plague. 

Faust (to the Devil, at his side): We did nothing."
2021-05-17 17:13,"I’m vaccinated and live in Southern MD. Gyms and restaurants have been open for business for the last several months. I have frequented both while taking precautions. I no longer feel the need to wear a mask, but I do respect others who continue to wear it. It’s a personal choice and should not be interpreted as a political statement either way."
2021-05-17 16:10,"If the vaccine is 97% effective, why would you wear a mask? With all that Mr. Glickman did, he still got COVID (so much for masks, right?). With natural immunity and a vaccine to boot, I think he's probably more protected than most. If you got polio, would you go and get the vaccine? Seriously, this is nonsense."
2021-05-17 15:17,"I'll go against the grain here and say that being able to take my mask off outside has really been pleasurable for me. Nothing beats fresh air and sunlight, and being able to go maskless outside feels like a psychological burden off my shoulders."
2021-05-17 16:21,"I live in Burbank and in the comments of one of our local news sources Twitter feed @myburbanknews, a resident said “I’m going to keep wearing my mask just so people don’t think I’m a Republican”.  The comment got multiple ‘likes’."
2021-05-17 15:49,"Your own David Leonhart recently dismissed caution by vaccinated folks as ""irrational fear,"" so as a nurse I'm particularly relieved that the Times is willing to take a balanced approach. Thank you."
2021-05-17 17:15,"I think I'll wait  awhile to see how the variants play out against the vaccines before entering indoor spaces without masking. In the current polarized climate of society, trusting individuals to abide by an honor system seems unlikely to be effective given the unsafe behaviors and attitudes displayed throughout this pandemic."
2021-05-17 17:18,"I’m an ICU doctor, and thanks to my line of work, I’ve been fully vaccinated since January. I’ve also seen and continue to see truly tragic cases of COVID. It’s definitely not gone and doesn’t seem like it’s every truly going away.

I’m feeling ok about the idea of unmasking indoors with small groups of vaccinated friends and family. I’m also feeling comfortable spending time outdoors with unmasked vaccinated folks. I don’t feel the need for a mask when walking or rubbing outside unless it’s in a very crowded space.

I don’t see myself spending time unmasked indoors with strangers any time soon, however. I just don’t trust people to act in good faith for the good of the community means a minor inconvenience for them (wearing a mask of unvaccinated). And while I have finally decided it’s safe enough to fly to see my family for the first time in 18 months, I will definitely be wearing an N95 in the airport and on the plane. 

I wish I could trust people to do the right thing and follow the “rules,” but we all know that’s not how it is."
2021-05-17 17:18,"I have no issue with people who want to keep wearing masks. But I am vaccinated and don’t plan to wear one and should not be judged for that when the CDC says it’s ok. The problem is when those wearing a mask feel entitled to tell those who aren’t to wear them when we are vaccinated.

I do plan to wear a mask when I get a common cold though. I hope this is a behavioral norm we can all start adopting so we have more healthy populations."
2021-05-17 17:18,"I will continue wearing a mask in crowded public places.  Because of  wearing a mask, this is the first year I have not had a cold or flu that tends to evolve into pneumonia."
2021-05-17 17:19,"I'm done with the masks. Been fully vaccinated for about a month now. I have appreciated masks, as I didn't get sick at all last year! I like that aspect. It was protection from far more than covid. 

That being said - I am young, and I believe there's something to building immunity through exposure to small doses of viral infectants out in public (besides covid). For that reason, and convenience, I am ditching the mask."
2021-05-17 17:19,I also plan on wearing my mask for a long time regardless of what others do.  I have little faith in the average human and it's best I follow what I believe is right for me.  I also prefer to avoid the flu and masks have proven effective.
2021-05-17 17:19,"I still wear a mask because I am around children under 12.

I still wear a mask because it has helped me control my seasonal allergies.

Haters need to RESPECT differing choices and move along."
2021-05-17 15:46,"Dan Rather says that he’s confused. The reason, Dan, is that this country, perhaps society itself, is becoming unraveled."
2021-05-17 15:28,"Until there's an actual pediatric vaccine in wide use, I'm keeping my mask on in public. Just because COVID killing kids is rare doesn't mean it's impossible."
2021-05-17 17:21,There are a surprising number of people here who are fully vaccinated yet say they will continue to wear masks like it was 2020. The fact (and the science) is a vaccine gives you more protection from COVID than a mask does. Is mask wearing post-pandemic going to become -- yet another -- form of virtue signaling? I sure hope not.
2021-05-17 17:21,"I plan to wear my mask for the indefinite future, but it's great to have the flexibility to not wear it. there's no reason not to wear it, I don't think I'm going to regret being ""too safe."" I will continue to wear it indoors in public at stores, or gatherings, but am fine taking it off on a walk or a hike. 

There are just so many benefits to the mask! I like muttering to myself, making faces at people, and keeping myself healthy from things that aren't COVID! No flu, pneumonia, bronchitis, colds... 

Just let people wear masks if they want. Who cares. it not affecting you."
2021-05-17 17:21,"I have read a great number, but by no means all, of the posts. It seems that most miss the point that wearing a mask provides protection to other people far more than it provides protection to the wearer. So when a masker meets a non-masker, what is really being said is:
Masker: I care more about your health than you care about mine.
Non-masker: I am happy to risk your getting sick if it means I won't be inconvenienced."
2021-05-17 17:22,"Good for Mr. Jones and all of the rest of the perma-maskers of which I am one of.  I too want to live as long and as a healthy life as I possibly can.  This year my entire family has been fortunate enough to have been cold and and flu free.  So many lives have been tragically and needlessly lost in this pandemic.  People in their 60’s, 70’s, 80, 90’s and even older should not have died from COVID-19.  We are such a puritanical society that views death as so taboo yet on the other hand some of us seem to also have a (latent) obsessive death wish.  So sad."
2021-05-17 17:22,"One thought: The vaccinated are safe to be without masks. It is the unvaccinated that are at risk if they don't were masks.  So, I guess we may see a rise in the unvaccinated getting sick and perhaps dying or struggling with long term effects.  Just as long as you're vaccinated, there is little need for worry.  It's the unvaccinated now who need to worry."
2021-05-17 17:23,"I’m still going to mask indoors with strangers. Enough people aren’t vaccinated that I don’t think we’ve seen the last covid wave and who knows what may come from other variants while most of the world remains unvaccinated

Also I’m pregnant with twins. My breathing is already difficult, I don’t want even a cold at this point. I don’t care if random people have a problem with it"
2021-05-17 17:28,More people need to be vaccinated before I will stop wearing a mask. I am concerned about the variants. People who wear masks are not hurting anyone. People who refuse to be vaccinated and are not wearing a mask are hurting others.
2021-05-17 17:28,"There’s a lot of people who believe the science when it enables their fears and inclinations to be shut-in’s or germaphobes, but discount it as soon as it indicates they have to get back out there and live their lives. 

I followed mask guidelines all they way through. Didn’t complain, didn’t think my rights were impinged upon, didn’t think I was going to suffer PTSD for having to do so. Now the guidelines have changed and I’ll happily change with them. Anyone doing differently as issues that should be looked into in therapy."
2021-05-17 16:08,Happy to see just announced that NY’s mask mandate drops as of Wednesday. Feel free to continue to mask up as is your right and of course I will respect the wishes of private business but this is welcome news.
2021-05-17 16:31,"I'll stop using masks when Covid goes the way of small pox and polio. Until then, my moon suit stays on."
2021-05-17 16:31,"When you read something of the form “It is rare to become infected given (certain conditions)”, remind yourself to google to see how rare the chances are.  Perhaps they are so tiny that they could not possibly be proportionate with other unrelated risks you take without a second thought, then give yourself permission not to worry about it."
2021-05-17 17:29,"I'm vaccinated and still mask.
Why?  Because there are enough inconsiderate people out there that were not masking before people were vaccinated.  There's no way of telling whether the person walking toward you without a mask is vaccinated or an anti-vaxxer.

So I wear my mask so that other people can feel safe.  I don't wear it for myself.  I really wasn't wearing it for myself even before I was vaccinated."
2021-05-17 16:49,"To the author:
Your piece is well written, relevant, and interesting but seems a bit sensationalized. The subtitle refers to a “backlash”, yet you provide almost no evidence of said backlash - only a reference to some being told by friends and family it’s ok to lighten up, and a suggesting tweet from Dan Rather. Perhaps the evidence of the anti-masker’s “ire” is out there, you just didn’t include it in your story. Or perhaps it’s overstated?"
2021-05-17 17:33,"The writer of this piece focuses on some of what I consider extreme examples and I don't think it is helpful. There might be more individuals who will continue to wear masks under certain conditions because we still have many who are unvaccinated. Personally, I will avoid big events for the remainder of this year. I've been to plenty festivals, concerts, sports, and arts events and don't see it as a sacrifice to wait until next year. i will also wear a mask for grocery store runs if it's crowded for the next few months."
2021-05-17 17:34,They are not alone and I will continue to wear my masks indefinitely - especially on planes and public transportation. I triple dare someone to challenge me on wearing my masks! I'm still dealing with lingering effects of covid from March 2020 and am grateful to be alive!
2021-05-17 17:35,if wearing an n95 and double cloth mask and eye goggles didn't prevent covid infection...that is really saying something as that is the maximum suggested prevention system.
2021-05-17 17:36,The vaccine I received is 95% effective. That means that 5 out of every 100 will get infected. I'll keep the mask because I don't want to be one of the 5.
2021-05-17 17:36,"Being considerate of others is one of many concepts that undergird the civilized societies. We would do well to learn from them about this, as well as about access to medical care, food quality and safety, family planning and support, child care, respect for educators and access to the highest-quality education,  etc., etc., etc. Too many people here know all about their rights and don't give a darn about their responsibilities."
2021-05-17 17:36,I believe the science and will mask/demask when the situation calls for me to do so. I might be inoculated against COVID 19 but the mask has helped me avoid the common cold. Whilst I might not mask up in the park or at my office I’ll be sure to mask up in the subway and when I go shopping.
2021-05-17 17:38,"1.  Is the virus completely contained yet? (No)

2.  Is the vaccine 100% effective in all cases?  (No one knows)

I think that we’ll wear our masks until the answer to both questions is a proven ‘yes’."
2021-05-17 17:38,"I'm 71, fully vaccinated but continue wearing a mask.  I was surprised by the CDC ""no mask required"" proclamation but we are as yet to see actual results of this experiment when nationally vaccination rates are so low.  The CDC has walked back some of their positions in the past, this possibly could be one if them. I also have allergies to various pollens, smoke and dust. Since wearing the mask my allergies have been remarkably better and I have had no colds or flu. So I will continue to wear my mask for the foreseeable future, sanitize my hands and socially distance in crowded indoor places such as the grocery store. It doesn't inconvenience me so I fail to see why it should bother someone else and it is no more offensive than nose rings and tattoos. As long as we have to live with so many unvaccinated and not wearing a mask I will keep my defenses up."
2021-05-17 17:41,"Why don't we all just give it a second.  Who knows what the world will look like - or what precautions will be necessary for any of us - in a year, nevermind ""forever.""  We have been through an enormous collective trauma, our information and the public health guidance is evolving daily, and there are many, many unknowns (variants, the long-term effectiveness of vaccines, how many people will ultimately get vaccinated, when all children will be eligible etc etc etc).  Let's all just be patient with each other, take a breath, and maybe stop this sort of sensational reporting."
2021-05-17 17:13,When the country achieves herd immunity I will consider not wearing a mask when necessary.
2021-05-17 17:36,"Masks do little to protect the wearer; they primarily protect other people, by reducing the viral load in the ambient air—air that we all breathe whether wearing a mask or not. 

That is a key point that is all too often overlooked in the mask controversy. Much to her credit, Ms. Nir, the author of this column, takes care to make this essential point.

2021-05-17 17:41,"This past weekend, I took my first unmasked walk in about 14 months, in Central Park. I was much more comfortable due to the rising temperatures but I had no shortage of guilt. I plan to continue to wear a mask (or two) on the bus, on the subway, and on trains such as New Jersey Transit and Amtrak. I greatly enjoyed not getting a cold or bronchitis over these past months, too.￼"
2021-05-17 17:11,Best reason to keep wearing masks? The freedom to talk to yourself without attracting attention!
2021-05-17 17:42,"I went to 5 stores yesterday east of Hartford, and everyone was wearing masks.  I don't have a problem wearing a mask for the time I'm in a store.   I'd rather consistency was maintained for everyone.  Some percentage of unvaccinated people will stop wearing masks if they can which increases the risk for other unvaccinated people as well as immunocompromised people (which probably includes some percentage of the elderly).  I'd rather see a big push to lower the positivity rate across the country to sub-one percent."
2021-05-17 17:42,"Like many here I disagree with the CDC 180° policy change. I'll still wear a mask where required by law/policy. 

I'll still wear a mask in situations *I* deem it prudent. Key word: *I*. However, my obligation to wear a mask where not required is gone. As a fully vaccinated person I'm unlikely to transmit Covid, but if that happens and an unmasked, unvaccinated person gets it from me, that's not my concern. Said person was fully aware he should have gotten vaccinated and should have been wearing a mask. 

I'm not talking about common sense or good health practices. I'm talking about obligation. My obligation to monitor or change my behavior to compensate maskless, unvaccinated people is gone. Don't like it? Wear a mask and get vaccinated."
2021-05-17 17:43,The CDC recommendation seems short sighted bordering on reckless. The only practical outcome is the anti vaxxers and covid deniers will be maskless and pretending to be vaccinated. Without an easy way to check the vaccine status we will not know. Major chains have said that they will not check. Those who are vaccinated are in danger of getting the virus from the vast majority who are not vaccinated.  While the symptoms are mild I do not want to contract the virus. Once again the CDC has bungled.
2021-05-17 17:44,"I don't see any reason why people can't wear anything they wish to whenever they wish to in their private lives. 

But it does not seem rational that otherwise healthy people who are fully vaccinated still feel the need to mask up ""just in case."" The vaccines are supposed to virtually eliminate the chances of your developing a serious case of COVID-19. This is according to the CDC, not me. If you don't believe the vaccines are good enough to substantially reduce your risks, then why bother subjecting yourself to the hassle of getting vaccinated in the first place? It doesn't make sense to get an unnecessary injection, and to take that vaccine appointment away from someone else who could actually use it. 

We can never, ever reduce a risk to absolute zero in the real world. We never have and we never will.

I can fully comprehend people voluntarily masking up during flu season as is done in much of Asia. I can also understanding voluntarily masking if your immunity defenses are not up to par. But these are distinct and separate issues. I can also understand someone distrustful of the vaccines choosing to remain masked and socially distant, because that is internally consistent. I don't agree with the logic, but there is logic at work there.

These may be good times to be an anxiety counsellor!"
2021-05-17 17:47,"I will continue to wear a mask for the foreseeable future.  

First, only 30% of my county is fully vaccinated, so most people are not vaccinated or only partially vaccinated.

Second, I have a small child and an immunocompromised family member.  I wear a mask for them, to help protect them and, for my child, to model good behavior.

Third, I feel solidarity with the front line workers.  They don't know who has and who has not had a vaccine, so I mask up to lower their stress."
2021-05-17 17:48,"I LOVE wearing a mask. I like to keep my face and my expressions to myself. I like not having to put on a socially-acceptable smile during work meetings, etc. I like not catching colds and the flu from my petri-dish of a workplace every year. 

I especially liked how warm it kept my face this winter. I'll never go outside on a cold winter day again without wearing a mask!"
2021-05-17 17:52,"I am a masker, but am fully cognizant that even some hospitals have  inadvertently bought counterfeit masks. And what about goggles? They would create less risk. I don't see any rush on those items. I rarely see them on the confirmed maskers. Life is complicated and has its risks. Some fetuses develop leukemia. By the grace of God, I am still around and close to 76. I feel very fortunate. I can only do so much to continue breathing, but, I do my best."
2021-05-17 17:54,"My partner and I both got the Pfizer vaccine 1st dose last week. We both have colds now. This has nothing to do with the mask debate, but it feels pretty weird, after not having a cold for 15 months. And yes, we have been following mask protocol."
2021-05-17 17:56,"There is also a large population of of people that have been vaccinated and still double mask.  There can only be two possible causes for this.  1) People are scared and the mask is like a security blanket for them,  they can hide their facial expressions and muffle their opinions or,  2) The mask now represents the lefts MAGA hat.  I think (most) people have some form of common sense that could be applied here. Except  the very extreme few that cant get the vaccine for one reason or another the onus is now on the non-vaxers  not the rest of us who played the Fauci game."
2021-05-17 17:58,"I enjoy wearing a mask, beside my face becomes partially invisible, it protects my face from sun ray and the traffic exhaust while walking.  Pandemic or not, wearing a mask is the way to go for me."
2021-05-17 18:00,It was extremely premature and careless for the CDC Director Dr. Walensky to change guidelines to no mask (for those people who were fully vaccinated) knowing 2/3 of the population are not vaccinated (full/partial). Now some businesses and people are in pickle. One can simply use their gumption (just wear mask) in this situation unlike the CDC who didn’t.
2021-05-17 18:00,"under trump, the cdc allowed itself to be compromised by political considerations 

they have (justly) lost all credibility 

people will have to follow their own counsel and if wearing a mask makes sense to them, who am i to protest?"
2021-05-17 18:00,"For those who wish to wear masks for the rest of their lives, that's completely fine. It's a matter of personal choice, and they're not hurting anyone else."
2021-05-17 18:02,"I really don't care if people choose to wear their masks for as long as they want to/feel comfortable.  It has no effect on me, so why should I be bothered?

I don't agree with continuing to enforce masking outdoors (now) or indoors (once we reach acceptable vaccination population vaccination rates and/or population spread reaches lower levels, which can only be determined community by community).  At that point, it is time to stop making people wear masks, but if they choose to do so, then fine."
2021-05-17 18:05,"Realistically, indoor air in most large stores was probably a toxic soup of germs and VOCs from all kind of chemicals (N95 won't help with those :( ) before Covid, and it will stay like that...for as long as people go to stores. Since we do not know when the next pandemic hits, may be best to be masked up in public. 

I also prefer looking at my reflection now that only mey eyes are exposed."
2021-05-17 18:05,Make mask-wearing a standard custom during cold and flu season and I bet a lot fewer people will be sniffling and coughing during fall and winter.  I didn’t contract a cold all last year and into 2021 . . . until the mask restrictions were recently relaxed.
2021-05-17 18:11,"On my first trip to Asia, I had a layover in Japan, and I noticed some people wearing surgical masks in the terminal and outside. I asked about it and was told that they may be ill, so they wear a mask out of courtesy to others. Impressive. Meanwhile, 20 years later, the right to not wear a mask in the U.S. borderlines the enthusiasm of second amendment rights. Sure, we can debate about the CDCs statement on easing mask wearing with vaccinated people, but the pervading sentiment of large groups in the U.S. prevents, and will continue to block, the implementation of any pragmatic health strategies, pandemic or otherwise."
2021-05-17 18:12,"I will definitely mask for airplane travel. 

Before COVID, on my last two trips to Europe to visit family, I caught colds--one that hurt my ability to enjoy the last week of my vacation and the other that made me miserable after my return home. 

Having an easy way to avoid the common cold/bronchitis due to travel is a real silver lining in this terrible pandemic."
2021-05-17 18:12,"The thing about the judgmental Trumpists is that if they had masked back in March/April 2020, all of us would have retained our freedoms to keep our businesses open. It is absolutely not the fault of those of us who voluntarily curtailed our own freedoms by wearing masks. These people are what doomed our response to the virus."
2021-05-17 18:15,"Continuing to wear a mask following vaccination can be a sign of an appropriately cautious mindset. Wearing an N95 mask, covered by a cloth mask, and goggles following vaccination, in all public spaces at all times, is a sign of mental disturbance."
2021-05-17 18:15,"The CDC should stick to reporting science (and do a better job than they did this past year), leave policy to policy makers, who have some concept on what the policy ramifications are for stores, restaurants,  schools, hospitals and their staff, customers, etc. I have a 2 and 4 year old, and people can’t differentiate between vaccinated or not. It just takes one person to pretend to be vaccinated and go unmasked to put others at risk (the mask is not for the wearer). Think that won’t happen? Just look online at the proliferation of fake PCR tests and vaccine cards."
2021-05-17 18:18,"The CDC’s change on masking could reflect acceptance of the reality that we won’t reach herd immunity through vaccinations. By encouraging the Covid, vaccine and mask deniers to eschew protection, Covid will continue to spread but mainly among the unvaccinated. This will build natural immunity in that group and contribute to herd immunity in the general population."
2021-05-17 18:18,"I'm vaccinated, but I take immunosuppressive medication; immunosuppressed people were excluded from the vaccine trials. Even before the latest CDC announcement, my doctor advised me to keep masking indoors, at least until there's enough data on vaccine effectiveness for people in my situation. With many unvaccinated folks likely to unmask now, I certainly will have to keep masking. Up until now, nobody needed to know I was immunosuppressed; I go to most of the same places everyone else does, just masked up like everyone else. Now I suppose I'll be harrassed as either neurotic, an anti-vaxxer, or will have to identify as having a medical condition -- which is nobody else's business. This is life in the era of ""freedom""-loving busybodies."
2021-05-17 18:19,"In my view, people who out in public unmasked are playing with fire because CDC is using an implicit honor system to let others decide whether to mask up or not.  And given the spread of bogus vaccine cards, plus vaccine hesitancy in certain groups, why I should gamble my personal health?  Masks are the most effective methods of protecting against covid aerosols, and I plan to continue wearing one in public."
2021-05-17 18:19,"The judgment here, about people who are hurting no one, choosing what they wear on their face is indeed bizarre. I'm vaccinated, and I'm still wearing a mask because not everyone is vaccinated and I don't want to be a bad example. And I like the idea as well of lower odds of colds, and lower odds of covid. The vaccine vastly reduces my odds of catching it, but it doesn't eliminate the possibility."
2021-05-17 18:20,"Just ordered two masks from Etsy with *vaccinated* written in small letters on one side. That way, people will know I’m not part of those unvaccinated folks. Since I’m planning on wearing a mask going forward, it will hopefully save me from those who would think otherwise."
2021-05-17 18:20,After being told wearing a mask was a matter of life or death what does one expect? The whole thing of what we have all been through is maddening in every way. I truly hope that if there is accountability some day for however this all began.
2021-05-17 18:21,"The title of this article is not useful and will possibly add to stigma and the increased politicization of masking. Many of the top infectious disease and public health experts in the US think that the CDC acted far too suddenly and in their recommendations re masking and in so doing are putting countless people (children, immunocompromised, and those who lack vaccine access) at increased risk. There is an ethical imperative for masking indoors in communities with continued transmission with our fully vaccinated rate still where it is in much of the USA."
2021-05-17 18:21,"The crux of this whole debate seems to be that people who are choosing to go without the masks post-vaccination, post-CDC's recent mask announcement, is that they feel judged as selfish or foolish by people who continue to wear masks. 

I won't lie and say that I do not judge. But the judgment is not necessarily moral. The judgment refers more to the word in its original sense. I cannot tell apart the vaccinated from the unvaccinated taking advantage of the new announcement.

Yes, I am concerned about my own immediate safety. But what I am truly concerned about is not the current strains but the strains that may evolve and against which the existing vaccines will prove less effective. The more people continue to contract and transmit the virus, the more opportunity it has to mutate into strains that, simply by the process of natural selection, gain resistance to existing vaccines. 

I will continue to wear masks because I don't want my own behavior to contribute to such a scenario (and here enters the moral judgment, yes). I tend to err on the side of caution, always. I stayed home even before California's lockdown, the first in the country, began because I could see the lockdown was coming anyway. Thankfully, I can afford to continue staying home and order groceries via delivery. I just gave away a box of N-95s to my local mail carrier who has an immune-compromised elderly mother at home. So yes, being cautious seems to be the considerate thing to do."
2021-05-17 17:11,"I don’t know of any of the infectious disease doctors that I work with who are dumping their masks. The P1 variant is on the rise and the vaccines are less effective against it. Based on the experience in Brazil, having had Covid with the original variant provides very little protection against P1. Also, we know that lots of unvaccinated people are going to dump their masks, claiming they are vaccinated. That’s just how Americans are these days. So I’m going to give it a couple months. If we don’t see another spike, then I will consider dumping the mask. ￼￼"
2021-05-17 18:22,"People without masks might or might not be vaccinated.  Without a mask I might bring home Covid19 (as well as whatever other viruses lurk out there) to my immuno compromised husband.  Yes, I'm vaccinated, but I'm wearing my mask at least until he develops some antibodies.  Also, I agree with others who continue to wear a mask because they haven't had a cold and don't have to bother with makeup."
2021-05-17 18:23,"Seems like people have forgotten that the primary reason for wearing a mask is to protect other people from what we all might be exhaling, not to protect ourselves from them."
2021-05-17 17:23,"Where and how did Mr. Glickman get all those N95 masks??  He either had them stocked up before the pandemic or procured them during the pandemic, when even medical doctors treating patients didn’t have them and couldn’t procure them."
2021-05-17 18:23,"I rather enjoyed not getting a cold, flu, or bronchitis this past year. 

A few years ago, I was coughing so hard from the yearly crud that I thought my lungs would burst out of my chest. And I can't take cough syrup because it has ingredients that make me sick. 

Not to mention my allergies are much milder this year.

I'm keeping the mask on."
2021-05-17 17:35,"If people want to wear a mask, what’s the big deal? I plan to continue wearing a mask where necessary or appropriate.  People seem to think that if you’ve been fully vaccinated you can’t contract Covid, which is not true. You still have between a 5-10% chance of getting it. You’re not likely to get but there is no guarantee that you won’t."
2021-05-17 17:09,"I'm with Dan Rather; why should anyone care if I choose to wear a mask?

Tucker wants us to take them off because they ""make him uncomfortable."" That he prioritizes his own comfort over other people's health just reinforces my desire to stay way more than six feet away from people like him, in perpetuity."
2021-05-17 18:25,"""But now, the backlash is directed at people who don’t plan to take them off.""
What backlash? Instead of lending credibility to the bullies who make those of us who need to or want to wear masks for reasons of immunodeficiency, or to maintain our general health, the NYT should focus its reporting on being supportive of the large minority group for whom wearing a mask has become a lifestyle and essential for a healthy future."
2021-05-17 18:04,"I’m going to continue to mask even though I am fully vaccinated. I don’t doubt the CDC on the science, but I do doubt the American public on their compliance. I can already see Tucker Carlson telling his flock to defy any policies reach rely on an honor system of being vaccinated to take off your maks, so can see the self righteous comments of those who wouldn’t “risk” vaccination proclaiming “unfair!” The only way I can see to counteract the risk they still present is to keep wearing a mask as if nothing has changed and hope others follow suit."
2021-05-17 17:24,"If people feel the need or desire to do that, fine, no skin off my nose.

To castigate or look askance at such people, who for all you know may also have non-covid related reasons for using a mask, may be a form of bigotry on the part of non-disabled people, and says more about the scoffer than it does about scoffed-at."
2021-05-17 17:08,"Countries in Asia have no issues with folks who prefer to wear a mask.  It's a sign of respect, frankly.  

If folks in the US want to continue wearing them, nobody should be shaming them.  If someone is uncomfortable being around others, I'm happy to wear a mask.

And frankly, if I'm going to be boxed up with a bunch of folks, I'll be wearing one, too, even fully vaccinated."
2021-05-17 17:56,"Mask wearing in East Asian nations became the norm after the 2002 SARS outbreak and seems to have continued to be so, particularly in public spaces and on public transportation, since.

2021-05-17 18:30,"It's not a simple Pascal's Wager.  All public health decisions and guidances involve trade-offs.  Joe Glickman may be limiting his exposure to respiratory contaminants by his double-masking and goggling (though there's really no evidence to support the notion that solo-masking when no one else is would really work all that well at preventing spread).  But let's just presume that he is.  Unfortunately for Joe, let's imagine the next pandemic spreads by fomites rather than by respiratory droplets.  Joe is actually increasing the spread of fomite-based contaminants through his hypervigilance on masking, increasing the risk of infection for both himself and everyone he comes into contact with."
2021-05-17 18:31,"President Biden, from the moment he said ""I do"" after taking the oath of office and sitting behind the Resolute Desk, he has become the Statesman he has trained and worked his whole life to be.  So it came at an unwelcome surprise to hear that the CDC was relaxing Covid restrictions

I fear that the CDC and the Biden Administration not only have abruptly, prematurely and ill-advisedly not only relaxed the restrictions on mask wearing and social distancing for those who have been fully vaccinated but have done so on the ""honor system"".  Now anti vaxxers and anti maskers, enabled by the easing of restrictions, will put the nation at risk, mask wearers will be targets for abuse and the inherent risks in the relaxing of restrictions when only 40% of the public has been fully vaccinated seems unwise in the extreme.  Add to this the Covid variants, the Covid crises in India, Brazil and elsewhere, and the predictable actions of several Republican governors who already put the nation at risk, opens the door to the possibility of a Covid resurgence in some form.
Say it ain't so Joe."
2021-05-17 18:27,"Just very disappointed CDC would open the flood gates on small businesses...and also disappointed to discover that most people do not seem to understand the danger of passing the virus around period, whether or not you are vaccinated.

Variants, mutations and asymptomatic carriers....did we learn no science during this whole ordeal??"
2021-05-17 18:11,"It’s something you feel, less about the facts and federal green lights to unmask, and more about what you sense and see and intuit. Everyone in my neighbourhood is masked. My doctors are masked. My grocery store employees are masked. My doormen are masked. My Starbucks baristas are masked. Nobody is trying to “make a statement.” We just feel it’s not time yet to go without. I don’t trust random people to have gotten vaccinated. I’ve heard of fake vaccination cards. I don’t give anyone the benefit of the doubt, strangers especially, because that could put me at risk. I’m vaccinated, but so what? You can still get Covid. And if my or anyone else’s mask offends you, well, knock yourself out."
2021-05-17 16:34,"This is weird. Why should anyone care now if some people decide to continue wearing masks--that is their business, and does it matter if that reason is absolutely valid or perceived as neurotic or ""unpatriotic""?  How petty can we get?

But I have to ask: Is harassment for mask wearing a serious problem these days? Are people coming up to mask wearers now and trying to shame them or even harass them in public? 

Or is it that some mask wearers merely ""feel"" they are being pressured or ridiculed? Perhaps they are sensitive to social pressure, but people are always judging what other people look like or do. You get glared at for how you are dressed, your physical appearance (too heavy, too skinny), for wearing a coat on a warm day or no coat on a cold day. So what!

If you want to wear a mask, then fine and stand tall about it; don't let anyone make you feel ashamed. One of the many legacies of Trump and the virulent right wing as well as the ""woke"" people is that disrespect, rudeness, and obnoxious behavior toward others appears to have increased. 

How do we--or can we--get back to empathy, compassion, and caring, to decency and respect?"
2021-05-17 16:17,"Keeping your mask on is another way of undermining the science. If you are vaccinated you can safely take it off. Why are you worried about what other people think? If you are vaccinated...you can also keep it on. No one is saying you should remove it if against your will. I just don’t get why people are now undermining science, the CDC, and Dr. Fauci. By making excuses instead of saying, I’m scared. Be anxious but don’t participate in a campaign of lies. It’s safe to take your mask off."
2021-05-17 17:20,"Unless you are wearing an N95 type of mask you are not protecting yourself from infection. The point of wearing a cloth or surgical mask is to reduce the blast radius of your own coughing and sneezing if you are sick. The reason for statewide mask mandates is because people with covid don't always know that they are contagious sick due to asymptomatic illness. If you are sick, please do wear a mask in public or stay home if possible. Continue to wear a mask if it makes you comfortable, but please understand the point of wearing a non-N95 mask. It is to protect the larger community from *you*."
2021-05-17 17:13,"There is a huge space between never wearing a mask (pre-COVID norm), and wearing one almost always.

You're sick and visiting an indoor public area? Wear a mask. 
You're immune compromised and COVID isn't over (i.e. right now)? Wear a mask.
You're walking alone outdoors? No need for a mask. 

I social distanced very seriously - I saw almost nobody for a year. But once I was vaccinated, I stopped wearing a mask outside altogether, and wouldn't wear one indoors if it weren't required by rule. 

Like with most things, people are irrational about COVID."
2021-05-17 18:34,"It’s really an exhilarating feeling taking the required mask off after work!  Freedom!  Another thing that I have noticed, is how some women’s beautiful eyes are are accented even more, when wearing a mask!  Anybody else notice that?  It’s interesting how we have adapted to less facial visual cues with mask wearing."
2021-05-17 18:30,"I hate masks ... continually  fogged glasses are no insignificant inconvenience and have accelerated the decline of my eyesight . I dutifully wore a mask although risk of the virus  never greatly scared me. It was a sacrifice for others' psychological comfort, security and safety. Now fully vaccinated I will be liberated. No more masks! Wear your mask forever if you want, but you will be expected to discard your righteous indignation against those who are vaccinated and choose not to wear masks."
2021-05-17 17:16,"The narrative on masks is missing the point.  

Being vaccinated has been shown to prevent both the illness and transmission (<a href=""https://www.verywellhealth.com/cdc-study-covid-19-transmission-vaccines-5121080"" target=""_blank"">https://www.verywellhealth.com/cdc-study-covid-19-transmission-vaccines-5121080</a> and <a href=""https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/effectiveness/work.html"" target=""_blank"">https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/effectiveness/work.html</a>) in the real world.

Yes, children are not vaccinated but they have not shown to be major carriers or transmitters of the virus (<a href=""https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/science/science-briefs/transmission_k_12_schools.html#:~:text=Although"" target=""_blank"">https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/science/science-briefs/transmission_k_12_schools.html#:~:text=Although</a>%20children%20can%20be%20infected,years%20(COVID%20Data%20Tracker).

Wearing a mask after being fully vaccinated is not ""protecting"" anyone, you have done that by being vaccinated.  

If wearing a mask after being vaccinated makes people feel better, that is fine.  But we need to move away from the narrative that wearing mask after being vaccinated protects anyone.  It is fine to wear a mask, just be clear it is a personal choice, a security blanket, virtue signaling, comforting, whatever.  It is fine, just don't claim it is science. 

The science is increasingly clear - vaccines prevent illness and transmission and have shown to be effective against most of the variants out there (<a href=""https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/effectiveness/work.html"" target=""_blank"">https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/effectiveness/work.html</a>)."

2021-05-17 18:36,"As an immune compromised 73-year old, albeit fully vaccinated, my mask will stay on in most situations for the foreseeable future. Not so much to protect me, as a mask really doesn’t all that much, but out of respect for other people in case I accidentally become an asymptomatic carrier. 

Others can do as they will. I will call out no one unless they are coughing or sneezing on people. By the same token, please have the courtesy to let me mask without attack or shaming. I am doing it mostly for you, whether you understand that or not. Your politics don’t matter to me where public health is concerned. Your life and the lives of your loved ones, friends, and others with whom you come in contact do."
2021-05-17 18:31,"Good for Mr. Glickman and everyone else who will keep wearing a mask. Anti-maskers and anti-vaxxers are all for shouting about freedom (which they never really seem to understand) and are then going to be upset that others are exercising their freedom to wear a mask? Seriously?

I will be wearing my masks for the foreseeable future as well, until a time when infection numbers are so low that it's more dangerous to drive my car than it is to be a room of unmasked people."
2021-05-17 18:37,"Continuing to characterize mask wearing as individual protection (as is the acceptable talking point of nearly every Nat Media Outlet) is a disservice to reality. 

We have a fairly reasonable idea concerning how masks work with regard to outflow, it's complex (rather than simple) but theory predicts observed results fairly well.  With regard to individual protection from inflow the story is less clear, other then simple probability of sufficient respiratory droplets landing on any specific chi-square window . . . even with a mask there are any number of crowded, poorly ventilated restaurants I would have, would still want to avoid.

What has been reinforced, since SARS and studies showing up since 2007 is that in a 'masked' population transmission via respiratory droplet is significantly reduced.  

Gambling on vaccines and depending on decency of human nature is fine . . . I have no particular issue with individuals that are now deciding they can perform unmasked (life must have been challenging for extroverts) . . . but failing to understand dynamics of public health is why we are in the depth of the mess we're in

If we had instituted appropriate testing protocols, developed policy to keep quarantined alive (including after they exited quarantine) we would not have had to crash the economy in the first (or 2nd) place.  & my guess (purely guess) is that it would have been cheaper.

Characterizing masks as individual choice for individual protection is a false narrative."
2021-05-17 18:18,"I lived in Japan from 2006-2010, long before COVID and the majority of Japanese wore masks in public, especially on public transit.  Makes sense to me. Too bad Republicans made it a toxic, political issue. Also...I’m fully vaccinated and have zero plans to go into crowded, indoor spaces without a mask anytime soon."
2021-05-17 18:38,"Excessive focus on the crisis of the day can distract us from the pervasive threats to our health and well-being.  Even before COVID, there were plenty of reasons to mask.  And many of these hazards continue despite vaccination.

In the occupational health and safety context, requirements for using respiratory protection follow from the presence of respiratory hazards.  But most Americans fail to appreciate pervasive hazards -- like carbon microparticles, mold, or ""dust"" associated with various activities.

For years, I've stocked N95 respirators at home to protect myself from such hazards -- not because of cultural influences.  I've also worn masks on domestic flights if I had a cough or heard one nearby.

Maybe we should be asking why Americans don't do more to protect our health and why so many only seek medical advice or care when blatantly suffering.  That discussion might help us understand why masks have become a symbolic flash point."
2021-05-17 18:08,"I survived a very nasty bout of Covid-19. I stayed locked away for more than a year, except to go outside away from people and everywhere I’ve been around people, I have been masked up.

In our house, we have been in our bubble working from home. We have done everything asked and more to be responsible people. 

We are all fully vaccinated now. Over the weekend, I went to Costco and my local grocery market in Utah. Both stores have dropped the face mask requirements locally as the state has ended mask wearing mandates since mid April. Private stores and local governments can still impose rules.

Now, early on in this pandemic I was accosted three different times by strangers for wearing a mask. The whole Trump political situation was behind it. 

Yesterday, when I entered Costco with the mask on and saw the sign saying vaccinated people could shop sans mask, I looked at the lady by the entrance and asked, “Really?” 

She said, “Yes, it’s true.” So, I took it off. It was surreal and liberating. I was one of only a few I saw inside without a mask and I could see numerous side-eyed looks at me. 

When I got to the grocery store it got really weird. I might as well have been Moses parting the Red Sea. I was getting some heavy glaring looks as people got away from me. 

In people’s eyes I’ve apparently gone from a masked lefty to a no mask righty. That’s how this has evolved. 

I am unmasked now to try to say to people - get vaxxed and re-enter a level of normal. But get vaxxed!"

Yes it's a change, but washing your hands, brushing your teeth, and basic hygiene was also a change in the past and we all do that now and live much healthier and long lives for it.

I plan to continue to wear a mask in most settings regardless of COVID."

In the same report it said the chances are ""very low.""  But the vaccine is not a silver bullet; and saying it's ""very unlikely"" to transmit is not the same as saying it's impossible to transmit.  Bottom line, there is still a chance - however small - that a vaccinated person can both get and transmit Covid-19.

That still gives people the right to go maskless.  What it does NOT do is give the maskless the right to harass those still wearing masks."

Call me cynical but these are the folks that think the election was stolen and the events of January 6 were warranted. I hardly think they'll have any qualms about claiming to be vaccinated when they are not."

Do you really think none of the millions infected wore masks? A third of adults didn’t even vote nor do they care about about partisan bickering. Many republicans wore masks and many democrats flaunted guidelines when it suited them. Some from each group got sick and others didn’t. 

Wear them or don’t, that’s not the point. Who cares. This article is a written about a problem that doesn’t exist. Literally nobody cares if you keep masking. Have at it. The mandates however should cease per the guidelines."

In most AP countries, if you're sick or think you're sick you wear a mask.  If you sneezed or looked sick you would be looked at as beyond rude without a mask.

I'm a bit puzzled why people in cars wear them with AC on and alone but anyone else...well even if I have an opinion I keep it to myself.   I've got allergies, this might be an interesting experiment to see if I breathe better."

Read two reports on it's effect on the version from India which is here now and one report said current vaccines were not very effective in preventing serious illness. The other report said vaccines held up very well to any new variant even the one from India, though hinted you may get a little sicker. Also break outs. Even if the vaccine usually protects you from dying and hospitalization, even people with no symptoms are equally eligible for long covid and the variety of disabilities it presents. We are the guinea pigs here. This guinea pig is going to mask. And I spent a bundle on the best masks too. Antimacrobiological something from Israel and DNA surgical masks with polypropa something. But I feel all the safer for it.  Oh and back to being a test subject, we really do not know how long this vaccine is effective do we? Shouldn't we get a gratuity fee for testing these vaccines out? I mean our tax dollars paid for it and we are the final trial subjects. I would like Medicare for All in this country as my reward."

Consider what used to happen at work.

Back when work involved going in to an office, I can't even begin to count the number of cold and flu viruses I caught from inconsiderate co-workers coming to work sick and who frequently refused to get a flu shot. And that's not counting all the sick people on public transportation. If only we had been wearing masks then! I don't think the working public can return to a maskless or mask/vaccine optional work environment if COVID and variants or new viruses are now in the mix.

Yes, I am tired of wearing one but I will continue to do so not only to protect myself, but also to show respect for others."

Today Texas reported:

* 0 Covid related deaths--the only time that's happened since data was tracked in March, 2020.

* the fewest Covid cases in over 13 months

* the lowest 7-day Covid positivity rate ever

* the lowest Covid hospitalizations in 11 months.

Thanks, Texans!"
2021-05-17 18:51,"Wearing a mask post vaccination for Covid avoidance is statistically akin to walking down the sidewalk wearing a helmet to prevent tripping and sustaining a traumatic brain injury. I would never bully or harass such an individual but I would feel sympathy for their inability to properly calculate everyday risks.

And I wouldn’t be hiring someone who so obviously struggles with logical processing."
2021-05-17 18:51,"I have gotten so sick with flu, colds due to my asthma and allergies pre mask. My bedazzled mask is pretty and makes me feel safer"
2021-05-17 18:51,"The CDC relying on Americans' ""personal responsibility"" when it comes to mask-wearing is a bit iffy.  If there's one thing this past year has taught us it's that Americans (for the most part) lack any personal responsibility at all when it comes to contagious diseases."
2021-05-17 18:51,"Even last summer, if I was in a park or walking down a wide uncrowded sidewalk, I'd lower my mask.

I've been fully vaccinated for nearly 3 months. When I returned to working in person last month, I kept my mask on even if there were not many people around. Now that it's getting warmer outside, I would like to take my mask off. However, my allergies are bothering me, so to limit pollen exposure and to protect others from my sneezing, I'll keep wearing it although I'd like to wear it less. 

Other factors influencing my mask wearing: most people in my neighborhood aren't vaccinated, so I'll keep wearing my mask when I go shopping or do laundry; I wear glasses and once I find the right fit, I'd rather keep the mask on; I'm dealing with breakouts and scarring.

Oh, and no annoying guys are asking me to smile for them!"
2021-05-17 18:54,"“This time, people who choose to continue to cover their faces have become targets of public ire.”

Why?  It doesn’t harm those who go without a mask, and it may even protect them (the non-mask wearer). 

An inexact analogy: some people like to wear, or for health reasons have been advised to wear, baseball caps or other low-profile hats or head coverings.  So long as the hats don’t have writing or images on them, and so long as they don’t prevent you from seeing the  stage, what’s wrong with someone else wearing a simple hat when they are out and about?

There are so many other, important concerns to act on these days; why get your blood pressure, and ire, up about what is essentially a simple piece of clothing or a simple medical device?"
2021-05-17 18:54,"I think we have a habit of making things more serious than they are, which in turn makes them more serious than they are. I am jealous of people who said their allergies were not as bad thanks to wearing a mask. I wish my apartment had central air too. I am sure wearing masks will become yet another health kick with vague benefits the way CBD oil has, which certainly has real positive benefits in specific cases, but does it really help your aunt's foot fungus? But did you know that wearing a mask while you exercise can actually enhance your workout making you healthier? I am excited for fashionable masks that sponsor celebrities and that have enhanced pollution filtering as well as viral, that way my mask will protect me from the mask factory smoke. If you can breathe through a filter, why not drink through one too, you don't know how many micro plastics are in your drinking water after all. In some ways wearing a mask makes real sense. I don't want the students I teach to learn about facial hair at too young of an age. People will tell you their is a limit to what a mask can do. Those people haven't read Romeo and Juliet."
2021-05-17 18:56,Of course people shouldn't be criticized or shamed for continuing to wear their masks for whatever physiological or psychological reasons the deem appropriate.  But there's something about the soul of communal life that simply lives and dances more freely when people's faces are in play.  I've understood it's absence but miss it greatly.
2021-05-17 18:58,A great grandfather of mine was known as cleanliness freak and drew plenty of giggles for it after he lived through the 1918 Spanish Flu.
2021-05-17 19:03,"I lived in Japan in 1981. Long-accepted practice meant people wore masks regularly if they were sick, even with a mild cold. On the subway, perhaps 10-15% of passengers, more in winter, would be wearing masks, out of courtesy and concern for their fellow humans. I repeat, out of courtesy and concern for their fellow humans."
2021-05-17 19:05,"Is that we know that wearing masks reduces the cases of regular flu, perhaps wearing a mask should be a seasonal thing."
2021-05-17 19:08,"In a recent Gallup survey, Democrats did much worse than Republicans in getting the right answer to the fundamental question: what are the chances that someone who gets COVID will need to be hospitalized? The answer is between one and 5%. 41% of Democrats thought it was over 50%, another 28% put the chances at 20 to 49.

No wonder some people won't take the mask off"
2021-05-17 11:30,"Many masks are practically useless.  The fabric is too thin or porous. People don't wear them properly, letting them slide down from their noses. People touch items in a store, then fiddle with their mask, touching the front.....might as well not be wearing a mask.

The real issue is that people on the Left don't want to be mistaken for a Republican.  It's the MAGA hat for the Left. That's where we are as a country."
2021-05-17 19:09,I have been vaccinated and did not contract COVID-19 but I will keep wearing a mask when I go into a crowded place. I will not wear it in a park or garden or out on a walk or hike in the open where there are no people. Better safe than sorry!
2021-05-17 19:13,"No one has mentioned the fact that we do not know for how long the covid-19 vaccines provide protection, or whether the protections they afford drop off at a certain point or under certain conditions, either one by one or as a whole."
2021-05-17 19:13,There have been many benefits to wearing masks.  I did not get the flu or one cold this season.  I like it!  I plan to continue wearing a mask for the foreseeable future.
2021-05-17 19:16,"Two of my co-workers who were fully vaccinated in March, got COVID two weeks ago.  Both are doing okay, their symptoms were truly manageable.

However, even with being fully vaccinated, working from home, and wearing a mask whenever in public, they got the virus.

Nothing is 100% although I cannot help but feel that being fully vaccinated AND the continuance of wearing a mask will help to greatly reduce the symptoms of COVID.

We are not out of the woods by any stretch of the imagination.  But at least we are beginning to see some clearing instead of just acres and acres of only wooded areas."
2021-05-17 19:19,I don’t want to be a guinea pig working with the public when we don’t know how long the vaccines last for. I have also gotten sick from sick colleagues who just had to come in pre-Covid. I’ll protect my sick days and health thank you. But hiking without one is lovely. Visiting and staying with my parents mask free priceless.
2021-05-17 19:20,"I think in most situations outdoors, it’s possible to maintain social distance between people. Just have consideration, and move away when necessary, don’t walk abreast in crowded areas, and keep your distance. Not that hard, most of the time. I know in a big city like New York it’s very different from where I live, but I know New Yorkers are smart and adaptable."
2021-05-17 19:22,"Life is just a matter of trying to play the odds in your favor. You do your best to play the odds in your favor; and then you relax, knowing that your odds are pretty good and that you have done everything possible. I eat a healthy diet. I exercise. I follow the advice of my doctor. I wear a seat belt. I obey traffic signals. I stay reasonably close to the speed limit. I social distance. I avoid crowds. I got a Covid vaccination as soon as it was available. I wash or sanitize my hands religiously. And I wear a mask. Since I started wearing a mask at the beginning of the pandemic, I have not been sick at all—no colds, no flu, no Covid. This made me realize just how much a mask improves your odds of staying healthy. The odds of you being exposed to a cold or flu virus are quite high. There is a possibility that a vaccine resistant Covid variant could come roaring out of India, although I don’t know what the odds of that are. Or a totally new virus might start a pandemic sometime in the future. It makes sense to me to play the odds in your favor by wearing a mask indefinitely--which is what I am going to do. It is a minor inconvenience. Social distancing is also a minor inconvenience. Avoiding crowds may be an inconvenience to some, but to me it’s no inconvenience at all. I don’t like crowds. By the way, the odds of something bad happening to you are much higher if you don’t get a vaccination than if you do get a vaccination."
2021-05-17 19:24,"The last year has been such a relief in one way:  I have asthma and every cold I get (generally from coworkers who cannot fathom the idea of staying home when sick) makes me very sick and can morph into pneumonia.  I have not had a single cold after shelter-in-place and wearing masks.  That has been an unexpected pleasure and one I wish to continue enjoying.

Count me in as one who will be continuing to wear a mask when I cannot socially distance sufficiently."
2021-05-17 19:25,"I love my mask collection. I will continue to wear a mask when I'm outside, forever. I believe people should always wear masks, much the same way that in the old days ladies and gentlemen wouldn't dream of leaving home without wearing a hat."
2021-05-17 18:38,"“an obdurate and sizable faction of vaccine holdouts”

Most salient phrase.  Especially the use of the word “obdurate”"
2021-05-17 18:58,Many fully vaccinated mask-wearers simply don't want to provide cover to unvaccinated mask-rejecters.
2021-05-17 19:18,Why does anyone care if people want to keep wearing masks?
2021-05-17 19:20,"Just as some trust and respect the police but chose to carry guns for security, so do some trust and respect the CDC and choose to wear masks."
2021-05-17 18:54,"Texas removed its mask mandate 2 month ago.  Today they reported 0 covid deaths, fewest cases in 13 months and the lowest hospitalizations in 11 months.  There is no state that currently has a mask mandate that can match those numbers.  And, only 30% of Texans are fully vaccinated. Do they already have herd immunity?  Are masks ineffective?  Makes you wonder."
2021-05-17 19:22,"The CDC director has said that fully vaccinated people do not need masks, period.  If you continue to wear one, you are harming society by not allowing it to return to normal.  Not so different than people who claim that Trump won the election.

Get over it.  The reason we have vaccines is so we don't have to be afraid of the virus anymore."
2021-05-17 19:03,"To mask or not to mask?

To divide and conquer or unite and evolve?

History books document (with due diligence) the results of feelings-based decisions. Feelings also drive the sunrise or sunset of social norms.

Do you notice how divide and conquer helps only those who seek to DIVIDE! (History documents the results of divide and conquer when you take the time to read history books.)

Kindly remember those like Glickman, who diligently do their absolute best to contain contagions . . .

wear masks

don gloves, gowns, shields

wash hands for at least 20 seconds or more

social distance themselves appropriately

. . . still die from said contagions.

See someone who’s NOT wearing a mask? Ask yourself, “Will I ever know all the reasons why this person chooses NOT to wear a mask?” 

Hint! If you think you’ll ever know anyone well enough to answer YES — think again. There’s ALWAYS more unknown than known — captured in Einstein’s words, “The more I learn, the more I realize how much I don’t know.”

Now more than ever before acts of compassion will unite us to evolve (versus dissolve into another cycle of divide and conquer). Your choice to wear (or not wear) a mask is a personal choice. To judge another soul for their choices fertilizes fear. Fear is a hammer. Hammering fear to pound a belief someone is better than or less-than — begins another cycle of divide and conquer.

Time to conquer fear. Yes?

How?

Stop judging!"
2021-05-17 19:17,"I hope people will finally internalize the fact that Covid (or any coronavirus like the flu variants) will never, ever, ever go away. It is endemic! Just like lice.

In airports I was the crazy lady who pulled the scarf up over my nose and mouth when anyone in 12 feet sneezed or coughed. The glares and occasional I got were fine because I stopped getting sick after flights.

This was my bank, where I had been banking for decades.   

I want to wear a mask on my face now until the entire virus has perished, not died from the earth period.  

Prior to everyone wearing masks, after the surge, women swore at me vociferously - tirades against me with female invectives/slurs/vulgarities at very high end places in the greater  Sacramento Central Valley.  My crime, asking the patrons to wear a mask indoors, as the companies had required them to do so and by state order. 

What I anticipate is the same disrespect for my personal safety that I have maintained since prior to the Governor's mandate, who is chief medical director for California.  

Secondly, the thin surgical masks do nothing.  I know because I worked during the pandemic in the summer. One of the people I had to work with informed me that she was ill, but I was persuaded that I was safe due to my mask.  I was not and became ill.

Properly-applied N95's and the like (i.e., actual respirators that create a seal and therefore actually filter the air you breath IN as opposed to partially filtering the air you breath OUT) even provide some measure of protection.

That said, I hope we aren't forgetting: ordinary surgical masks do NOT protect the wearer - they protect everyone else! Wearing a mask doesn't make you safer, it makes EVERYONE ELSE safer - which is a great reason to do it!"

Although I'm vaccinated I'm going to keep wearing mine for the time being and if anybody asks about it I'm just going to say, ""I don't want to catch what you've got."" That will hopefully leave them wondering."
2021-05-17 20:05,"I'm interested to read that so many vaxxed people plan to continue wearing masks indoors, and having read these comments, I think I too will mask up for stores, museums, performances, offices, to protect myself against those who are not vaccinated. Given that the unvaccinated will be unmasked now, I may even go back to my KN-95 masks: those stories of Long COVID (after mild or even asymptomatic cases) sound life-altering and like something to be avoided. On the other hand, I've been unmasked outdoors since my vaccination was complete two months ago--pretty common here--and plan to continue that."
2021-05-17 20:06,"I truly hope they don't make 5 and 6 year olds wear masks indefinitely. There are benefits to seeing peoples' smiles and facial expressions, and surely for kids learning social/emotional skills. If an adult chooses to wear a mask after they are vaccinated because they are scared that is their prerogative, but now that I am vaccinated I will be enjoying seeing people's faces and sharing smiles."
2021-05-17 20:06,I still want social distancing rules while on line at stores. I don’t like it when people come up behind me on line and then hang on my shoulder the entire time as if they could magically pass through my body and end up ahead of me.
2021-05-17 20:12,"So did someone issue the ""All Clear"" notice?  The notice that we have reached Herd Immunity?

My brother is a virologist, but most people are not as lucky.  His advice to me is: It is best to mot mess with Mother Nature.

I will heed his advice."
2021-05-17 20:20,"I see a lot of people commenting that they will keep wearing a mask because they didn’t get a cold or flu this year. 
I just wonder how much your mask protected you and how much it’s been down overall social distancing and handwashing? 
In Sweden, there was no flu this year at all but that’s because of general social distancing and hand washing (as the government until recently encouraged other forms of social distancing over masks)."
2021-05-17 20:23,I will continue to wear a mask after being fully vaccinated because the long hauler symptoms are dreadful.
2021-05-17 20:26,"I see a new market for masks that read, ""Fully Vaccinated, Just Careful"" with this nonsensical ruling. By definition, only those not wearing masks in public places should now be considered vaccinated and masked people, unvaccinated. We know it will be just the opposite. Just today I learned that Target is following the herd and saying no masks - not for shoppers, not for employees. Only since a couple of weeks ago did I go back to Target, after reaching fully vaccinated status. But I won't stand in line with a bunch of unmasked, and surely unvaxxed, shoppers. It was fun while it lasted."
2021-05-17 18:54,One's face is the surest way to identify the person. Masks inhibit this. Once the pandemic is over there is going to be a considerable pressure on people to show their faces so they can be identified by others. Defy this at your own risk.
2021-05-17 20:28,"I'm grateful to be fully vaccinated and will wear inside for church services and other events with crowds.  Not living in a city, I ride my bike and don't come in contact with many people outdoors. However, I always keep a mask with me at all times in case it's needed.  Come fall with cold/flu season, I definitely will mask even if not mandatory, as I have underlying conditions and think it makes coughing/sneezing folk next to me less menacing.

The ambiguous CDC position certainly didn't help matters."
2021-05-17 14:53,"You all can wear your masks forever for all I care. So long as you can no longer force anyone else, we are all happy. Tired of the incessant scolds which is why you will never stay in a majority politically.

And I am vaccinated too, but can't stand all the non-scientific virtue signaling.

Chance of getting infected already small for vaccinated. Chance of getting severe Covid or death is practically non-existent for vaccinated. 
Chance of passing it on if infected is almost non-existent due to very low viral loads (CDC showed in new studies).

Wear your mask for whatever reason you want, but the rest of us are done with it and very soon you won't be able to force others even in your own blue bastions."
2021-05-17 20:28,"I believe that pretty much everyone will catch the Covid-19 virus at some point masked or not. So to me it’s no longer about living in fear. I caught the bug and I was socially distancing, go figure. Unfortunately, like the flu and other viruses, this bug is here to stay. I don’t mind if others continue to wear the mask. I won’t, especially after catching the virus and being vaccinated. For me this is just the end of another crazy chapter of NYC life."
2021-05-17 20:28,Mr Glickman's case would seem to confirm that most Covid transmissions occurred and occur between intimates in the home not in public spaces such as supermarkets. If I were Glickman I would be more curious as to where I had contacted the virus considering the level of precautions taken when in close proximity to strangers.
2021-05-17 20:29,"Pretty safe to say there’s a group that no matter what threshold is met, will wear their masks. So just let them be. The only thing they can’t do is try to make others do the same."
2021-05-17 20:31,"There have always been overly cautious or fearful people. Some people spend huge amounts of money on fancy security even in a gated community. In a more extreme example I've heard of people buying body armor to protect themselves from a potential stray bullet. Some have specific phobias such as of heights, tight spaces, spiders, crowded places, flying, germs on surfaces, etc. and I think now we'll see an increase in a phobia regarding catching an airborne virus (of any kind).

Let's allow people to be themselves, even if they are doing something seemingly drastic to protect against a very rare risk. It is the personality of that person and it doesn't need to make much difference for those around them in public."
2021-05-17 20:31,"I am a COVID long hauler, and I am never going to be fully vaccinated because I had an anaphylactic reaction to dose #1.  I frequently have problems with vaccines due to severe allergies, so this has nothing to do with it being a COVID vaccine.  I already had to wear a mask for about 1/2 the year while volunteering at a hospital since I can't get flu shots.  I work with the public.  

I suspect that I will continue to wear a mask indoors or in crowded outdoor situations for at least another year.  Unfortunately my state has a ton of anti-vax people.  I have no idea if or when we would get to herd immunity."
2021-05-17 20:32,"First the smartphone and now the mask, yet another tool to shield us from random interpersonal connections. Kinda sad."
2021-05-17 12:03,"Please, it’s ok, take your masks off and breathe deep.
Life is good, now let’s all move on.
What I say to patients every day."
2021-05-17 20:33,"I’m a recent Cancer survivor. I started wearing a mask approximately a year before the outbreak. It first felt odd, wearing a mask in public, but I understood it to be a necessity. I am remission now, and will continue to wear a mask when indoors or close proximity to others. I shudder to think of those with frail health being harassed by the no-mask jerks.  We have really declined as a society."
2021-05-17 20:34,"I get it for those immunocompromised, but wearing a mask is awful.  I can't wait to see people's faces again.  I believe in the science, followed the rules, am fully vaccinated, and very excited to get back to normal."
2021-05-17 20:35,"The Times having been one of the leading purveyors of murky information about variants. Expert predictions, and subsequently the data thats emerged, all strongly indicated that the vaccines would remain effective against variants for the near future, and yet nearly every article published on the topic here has muddied the waters on this on that point. I’ve seen the effect it has on friends first hand. Good on the CDC for being clear about the risk last week. Hopefully this paper will follow suit."
2021-05-17 20:37,"We have all been traumatized over the last year.  I believe it's okay to take the mask off outdoors, if you're not going to be in close contact with anyone else.  It's okay to breathe in some fresh air.  But I plan on continuing to wear the mask in stores, on public transit, etc., because after months and months of feeling like some invisible enemy was stalking all of us, I need to feel ready before I take it off for longer periods of time.  If others feel they'll never do that, I respect their feelings.  We all have a lot of adjusting and processing to do."
2021-05-17 20:15,Even better would be if I had a say in those people who should wear masks and those who shouldn't
2021-05-17 19:58,"The lack of flus and colds this past year has been refreshing, all from wearing masks (and social distancing). As the article mentioned, masks in public have long been common in parts of Asia (e.g., Japan), but spitting in public, even in cities, is disgustingly prevalent in China. Let's take the good stuff, and leave the bad..."
2021-05-17 20:09,"All the lashing and backlashing can continue unabated.

I am vaccinated and know that I am overwhelmingly safe, but will be guided by a simple principle. It's not cut and dry, but it's how I choose to proceed.

I will be unmasked in any social situation or public space in which it is clear that those -- or most of those -- present are comfortable not wearing masks.

However, in situations in which I sense that those -- or most of those -- present are still wearing masks, I will wear one solely out of respect for the feelings of those people.

This morning I entered a lab for blood work. Masks were not being required. The room, though, was filled with masked seniors. Putting on my mask was an easy call and the last thing I felt was that I was being complicit in the erosion of my individual rights.

I saw anxious people whose health was clearly compromised. Period.

This is almost certainly a choice that many who proudly situate themselves  in the culture of selfishness would consider the full-snowflake. Fine. They should do their thing knowing that I don't give a flying fig.

I simply choose , in a period of uncertainty, to pay as much attention to the feelings of others as to my own choice to be maskless."
2021-05-17 20:15,"I don't know about everyone else, but I have enjoyed the anonymity and being able to hide my ugly mug without judgment. I'll continue to wear my mask."
2021-05-17 20:15,"I wish I were surprised to see that it’s not good enough for the yahoos who seriously helped spread and extend this pandemic that THEY don’t to wear a mask unless they’re using public transportation or indoors where it’s crowded—oh no, they need to get belligerent with everybody else and try and bully them into following their orders. 

Good job that the threats, insults, wacko explanations and so on don’t impress me much."
2021-05-17 20:00,"I fully support anyone who decides to continue wearing a mask, and think it's no one else's business. However, the peg to this story seems overdone and unsupported. What is the evidence that mask-wearers are being ""targeted"" for ""ire""? Because ""friends and family have urged them to relax"" and because one guy got a dirty look in the supermarket? Sounds like most people are leaving them alone, as they should."
2021-05-17 20:09,"It doesn't harm anyone else if someone decides to wear a mask. It CAN harm someone else if you decide NOT to wear a mask. So, if there's no harm to anyone if someone wears a mask, what's the issue? My guess is that you feel threatened, guilty, triggered, or all of the above. Genuinely ask yourself where your rage is coming from when you feel like you want to rip the mask off of someone who is wearing one, or castigate them with childish taunts."
2021-05-17 20:21,"One great side effect of wearing a mask, among many others, is there’s less worry about bad breath.
Who knew?"
2021-05-17 20:08,"Why is it that anti-vax / anti-mask people need their choices validated by bullying other to conform accordingly, and then, when others resist, they accuse them of being sheep?  If I want to conntinue to wearing my mask, how does that affect some stranger at the grocery store?  How is my choice about them? I fail to see the reasoning."
2021-05-17 20:38,"There will be some very few people with a reason to wear a mask because of Covid, I'm sure. But anyone with a normal immune system who was vaccinated is actually hurting themselves by wearing a mask. We need to begin to be exposed to normal viruses and germs again-colds, flu, etc or we will get really sick if we come across those germs. Everyone's immune system took a hit during the pandemic by not being exposed to normal germs; do not weaken your immune system any further by wearing masks and avoiding people once you are vaccinated."
2021-05-17 20:39,"“'As a woman, we feel like we have to, when we go out in public, put on a little bit of makeup, eyeliner, blush,' said Keela Samis, 57, an attorney from St. Petersburg, Fla., who is vaccinated and does not plan to stop wearing a mask. 'With a mask I don’t have to. It simplified my life.'""

Just want to note that if you don't want to wear makeup you don't have to, even without a mask. Also, if you are wearing a mask and you want to wear eyeliner (or eye shadow) that makeup will still be visible. One good thing that might come out of this awful pandemic is a more relaxed attitude among women who feel like they ""have to"" wear makeup. If you enjoy using makeup, great. But no one should feel obligated."
2021-05-17 20:40,"N95 Masks are good for seasonal allergies, wildfire smoke and preventing colds and flu."
2021-05-17 20:41,"I absolutely don't trust anyone who is not wearing a mask indoors to be vaccinated and telling the truth, and plan on wearing mine. I am glad to read I won't be alone."
2021-05-17 20:46,Isn't that his business?  If a mask ups your chances 5% what's the problem?
2021-05-17 20:47,"As long as lots of people are dying and a much larger percentage is still to be vaccinated I will be wearing my mask in the stores and other closed quarters situations and I'm vaccinated. There are too many people who think we want to see their faces to begin with, stop fooling yourselves."
2021-05-17 20:50,One place I won’t be wearing a mask in the future is restaurants. Why? Because I’m not going to eat in a restaurant ever again. I learned to make really good food at home and enjoy it so much more than a crowded noisy dirty restaurant. And the best part is it’s saved me thousands and thousands of dollars.￼
2021-05-17 20:51,"If the CDC, the governor, local mayors and health authorities deem it safe to go without a mask if you're vaccinated, that's good enough for me. Cases and hospitalizations are dropping. More people are gaining immunity via vaccinations every day. We're safer now than any time in the past year.

Not being required to wear a mask doesn't mean you can't wear one. Always surprised when people don't get that. 

Do what you feel is right for you. I'll do what I feel is right for me."
2021-05-17 20:51,"If other people want to continue masking up, that’s their call. If they want me to mask up while under their roof, I’ll do it; even if I think it’s silly, it’s the polite thing to do and is of no consequence to me.

Otherwise, as someone who is already-vaccinated, I feel safe enough to go about as I did before and breath in that fresh air."
2021-05-17 20:00,"My guess is that any woman who has ever had men yell ""smile!"" at  her as she walks down the street has been grateful for this long stretch of mass masking."
2021-05-17 20:50,"I just don’t trust the CDC to get anything right again for a while. It is a sad state of affairs. However, their politicized advice needs to be taken with a grain of salt. I’ll keep wearing the mask until we have a day with zero deaths. Right now we are around 750/day."
2021-05-17 20:50,"Ive been wearing a black mask that absorbs uv rays and offers some protection from the sun,  from germs and frpm dust when i feel the need my entire adult life.in seoul there is nothing weird about this. And we koreans were supposed to be self conscious"

2021-05-17 20:48,"I hope mask wearing on public transportation becomes ""a thing"" long past the end of this pandemic. All up-side...less germ dispersal, less bad breath, etc."
2021-05-17 20:39,Why is wearing a mask unrealistic when only 38% of the US population is fully vaccinated?
2021-05-17 20:56,"When I was in Japan in 2018 (pre-COVID) a lot of people were wearing masks--- especially in Tokyo, especially on the subways. I'd say maybe 25% of people. I asked why and was told that people had different reasons--- people who felt they might be ill did so out of consideration for others, not wanting to spread their germs; people who didn't want to get ill did so to protect themselves. Perhaps people also did so to filter out allergens, bad smells, smoke (not that there was hardly any), etc. or maybe even for anonymity. Who knows? At the time I thought it was a bit weird, though I got used to it quickly. And, of course, in Japan being considerate is a thing--- unlike the me, me, me, me, me USA of Free Dumb. Now of course, the sight of people wearing masks has become common. And, perhaps, continued use of masks will reduce transmission of flu, colds, etc. However, I must say I am quite happy that I am able to now ditch mine almost all of the time."
2021-05-17 20:36,"I went to Target this morning, and the store still requires a mask. So what did I see? Lots of people without masks. I’d be willing to bet that they are the unvaccinated Republicans who fought Target, with very foul language, when it first required masks. I’m keeping my mask on indoors. Counting on the honor system is a joke."
2021-05-17 21:00,"I’m astonished that no one here in this comment section has any concern for the death of vitality in public spaces, for the absence of meaningful social encounters that can occur in public spaces, most of which are enabled by the intimacy of being able to see another person’s face. But it makes sense because these days it seems most people would rather conduct their lives virtually than in person, in spite of the fact that our contemporary epidemic of loneliness and our sedentary lifestyles will likely have a public health impact greater than Covid. I’m a liberal and I’m officially exhausted by liberals. It seems that so many people “believe in science” until it conflicts with their feelings. I feel I have a civic duty to follow the CDC recommendations: shelter in place, get a vaccine, eventually relinquish the mask. If the general public can’t trust its own institutions and prefers following its own intuition and hunches, what have we become as a country? A collection of raging individualists on both sides of the political spectrum, hellbent on immortality and narcissistic self-inflation, at the expense of civic vitality, trust and community. Imagine what we could achieve if we could somehow harness the mask fervor among the vaccinated to fight global warming, whose adverse impacts could make Covid-19 look like a picnic. I hope the kindergarten teacher who plans to remain forever masked while teaching phonics will reconsider! Those kids *really* need to see your face."
2021-05-17 21:02,"I'll wait to see if we have another surge in the pandemic - as still a majority of people in the US have not been fully vaccinated and the virus keeps mutating.  I'm glad places are opening up but why not be cautious until this is clearly in the past?  I don't know how long that will take, no one knows.  Certainly not the CDC which is ignoring the results from Asian countries which have successfully battled pandemics longer than we have.  Masks work and keep people safe.  It's a small price to pay."
2021-05-17 21:03,"By far, most people in my liberal neighborhood wear a mask when out shopping. Consequently, I will continue to do so because I would be be beyond mortified if someone thought that I may even possibly be a Republican."
2021-05-17 21:05,"My county is only 35% fully vaccinated, so I will continue to wear a mask in public places indoors despite being vaccinated myself. Our govenor has not lifted the mask mandate, but he updated the guidance to the CDC recommendations. Most business so far in my area have not stopped requiring masks (even for the vaccinated), which personally I think is smart in order to help protect their employees being that no one is checking vaccination cards. It's going to be a process and only those who didn't believe in or want to wear them in the first place will be ready to toss them aside right away."
2021-05-17 21:06,"We undoubtedly will have some like this in Berkeley.  I don't see many without masks outside yet in spite of the latest CDC directives and the accompanying evidence. (which was actually documented months ago, for outside.)"
2021-05-17 21:07,This will probably prove to be a moot point on the West Coast where plenty of people wore masks for most of the summer because of the dangerous air quality from wildfires.
2021-05-17 21:07,"In reference to the end of the article, people can certainly express themselves while wearing a mask. I’ve had many exchanges with people in stores and smiled, and it was clear as day that the other person smiled back. As someone with immunity issues, I will continue to mask in public indoor places, as my doctor recommended I do. If anyone gives me a hard time, I’m not sure I’ll even bother responding."
2021-05-17 21:09,"Paranoia is the only explanation and it has social costs that seem to be ignored. Not seeing someone's smile, expressions, their laugh is a high cost just to satisfy unfounded fears not based on science. If you think you are going to get infected after getting vaccinated then you should not be driving a car or crossing the street. The odds of getting hurt are much higher in those cases."
2021-05-17 21:13,"I have no faith in the CDC's information and hence the lifting of guidelines. 
I want to see the science from Moderna and Pfizer published concerning how long their vaccines are viable. 
I want to see the actual data. 
Is it 6 to 12 months as is published from Moderna?
That leaves too much wiggle room for me. 
I'm a two time cancer survivor and I can't afford to take a government agency's word on this. 
The CDC did an overnight flip flop. It's all too convenient for me."
2021-05-17 21:14,I will continue to wear my mask outside when cycling because bugs! I've eaten many fewer bugs this past year. SPF mask also good sun protection on long rides. For those who have an opinion about what I wear? I don't care! Find something else to worry about.
2021-05-17 15:58,"Fine, live and let live."
2021-05-17 21:20,"I was fully willing to wear a mask for the past 14 months in order to help slow the spread and wait for a vaccine.  At this point though, we have to move on.  Vaccines are available, kids are low risk, and no judgement on anyone to keep the masks on.  But it's time to end the mandates."
2021-05-17 13:20,"While I continue to wear a mask inside and in more crowded outdoor places, I must say that I miss peoples faces.  So much facial communication has been lost. Eye language only goes so far on its own.  My sardonic and sometimes sarcastic words - and the listeners response - often lose their meaning and impact without the accompanying full facial expression.  And, I confess, this sometimes flirtatious old man also misses the smiles of all those attractive women as well.  (ー_ー*;  )"
2021-05-17 13:02,"Masks or no masks.  Vaccinations or no vaccinations.  Everything in this country turns into politics, patriotism becomes fascism, social democracy becomes communism, leaders become criminals, and citizens become unworthy of their citizenship.  If only there were someplace else to live."
2021-05-17 11:54,Mr Goickmam never ventured out without two masks and goggles yet caught COVID? The article seems lacking in detail. Is there some reason that despite these usually highly effective precautions he was at risk? What was it ?
2021-05-17 21:21,"I am vaccinated, but will continue to mask up. The CDC says vaccinated people can go without mask but here everyone is without a mask and are not vaccinated.  They should have to show vaccine card as proof.  I do know that i didn't get sick this year and my allergies as well as the kids are not anywhre near as bad with the masks on."
2021-05-17 17:23,"I really don't get why this mask confusion and debate.   You got your shot and you socially distanced for a year.   From there on do what make you comfortable.   
I really don't get American's.  CDC says eat less fried chicken Americans make a bee line to KFC.   
CDC says don't wear a mask outside etc. Americans are all twisted up in a knot.   
Bottom line, if you wanna wear a viking helmet all day it's none of my business.   
So ,wear a mask, wear a whole box of masks for all I care.   
It's none of my business."
2021-05-17 17:13,"Like sneezing into my elbow instead of my hands, wearing a mask when I feel ill or when the flu is raging, seems like a change in etiquette that should be embraced. C'mon Miss Manners, please do proclaimeth this reasonable way forward"
2021-05-17 20:58,"I thought wearing masks was weird when it first began. But now after over a year of wearing masks, I actually like it. There are less diseases spread, less flu and less covid. And I agree with the woman who said that it makes people more anonymous and it therefore easier to blend in with everyone. When I get carry out food, I see all the food preparers wearing masks, and I think, that is such a good hygienic practice, to think...all those germs being breathed onto the food before, how can they can go back being maskless? Same thing with shopping in crowded stores jammed packed with people, breathing in who knows what someone might possibly have. So, yeah, if people want to keep masking, it's their right and nobody's business if they do."

Yes this is more a politic decision then science just funny how the change came after a couple of female senator complained they don't trust the CDC but they trusted it under Trump? but more of the cover they are giving the President on this, that he knew nothing about the decision until the CDC made it and really the honor system, really you mean you want those people who have not gotten the Vac to ear a mask, aren't those the same people who never wore a mask.

I'm going to keep wearing a mask in crowded places indoors, too, for the same reasoning.  Crowds of humans are great places to find pathogens.  And its just the same mask that both of us have worn for years when sanding.

I view life as my movie.  I'm the leading man, my friends are supporting actors, and the rest of you are by-and-large extras who will not get a credit when the end rolls nor will you get your SAG card.  So, I really don't spend much time worrying about what the extras in my life think about me wearing a mask to the store.

Who cares why? I also couldn’t care less if my wearing a mask, for whatever reason, bothers other people. It certainly isn’t hurting anyone else and may be helping. Why on earth would someone get offended by another donning a mask? That being said, I feel comfortable not wearing a mask because I am vaccinated.

The unfortunate commonality of all this denial and ignorance is that PEOPLE LIE. That has become “normal” amongst a large segment of the population thanks to Idiot Trump. It is NOT normal for, and I am a Doctor. Without verifiability of complete vaccination, I TRUST NO ONE and will not remove my mask in public, dine INSIDE a restaurant, fly in a plane or ride on a bus or subway - no matter what the CDC says.

That has nothing to do with science, but rather my belief that the unnatural lives we have been leading for the last year have had profound and poorly understood effects on mental and physical health. This is especially true for the 'privileged' who had the option to self-quarantine, and have been forced to admit to themselves the inequities in our society, which kept them relatively safe from Covid, while those who served them fell ill. This pervasive guilt is not working to advance us toward a more just society, it is warping whatever constructive conversations we were still capable of.

As regards science - there is not a lot of evidence at this point, but there are early indications that some variants can indeed escape the antibodies acquired either by immunization or prior infection. 

And why would it be otherwise? Is it the case that you received a single influenza vaccination and were then set for life, or is it the case that you need a new inoculation every year, and still may get the flu even if vaccinated?

Covid could have been eradicated had there been early and draconian efforts to forcibly isolate anyone suspected of being infected, and had our borders been completely sealed. Even then, for how long would we need to isolate ourselves from a world with a genie long out of the bottle?

Please wear masks, forever. You might wind up like the poor man described here, who double-masked and STILL got sick!"

I can breath easier, masked up, around others questionable manners and germy lack of hygiene invading my breathing space.

I have been very fortunate that not only  that did I not catch covid,  but I have avoided other annual cold and flu illnesses this year, seasonal allergies down as well.

Do the math.  The folks that refused to wear masks, and those that don't want to be vaccinated, take the new CDC announcement as license.  They won't follow the recommendations.

When you go to a restaurant (last November) and they have a sign on the door saying that any staff without a mask have a medical reason not to wear one - and NO ONE has a mask on - do you believe them?  I don't.

We had an anti-mask demonstration group of non-locals barge into a local family-owned market a couple of weeks ago.  Do I think any of them will follow the new recommendation?  Not a chance.

I haven't had a cold, flu or my annual bronchitis in the last year.  I'll keep my mask, thank you.  With people I know personally, and I know they've been vaccinated, I'm perfectly happy to take off my mask, and have been doing so.  The rest of you out there?  Not so fast."

I recall that someone (maybe Susan Sontag?) wrote a book about illness as metaphor, i.e., people with illness, especially illnesses that are poorly understood, can be treated as if they have character defects.  I realize that I have been somewhat traumatized by my illness and am committed to not becoming sicker.  My advice to everyone is you don't want to become sick in this country -- we don't handle it well.  I got hostile looks from some in my mostly (I'm assuming) Democratic neighborhood for wearing a mask, even before the CDC announced modified recommendations for mask-wearing.  Most of the looks were from younger, presumably healthy, people, who did not don masks even when it was mandated by the city.  One of my take-aways from Covid, although a reluctant one, is that we are a country full of judgmental people.  We also place a very high value on performance and competitiveness -- much less so on compassion and tolerance.  Illness is consciously or unconsciously seen as weakness by too many.

Second, the above-mentioned deniers, coupled with others who refuse to get vaccinated, have left us far below herd immunity.  

When we go to indoor venues where there are lots of people we have no way of knowing the nearby viral load we are exposed to because of the unvaccinated, many of whom may be unmasked and increasing said load.  We both are in our 60's, vaccinated and have worked as nurses.  So, we understand enough about the increased risks under such circumstances. 

Nobody better challenge us, either.  I have had it with anti-vaxxers risking the health of the rest of us.  The last thing I need to hear- no, the last thing they need to do- is challenge my wife or I as I've heard some have done elsewhere.

Vaccines are around 75% - 95% effective and in trials 100% effective against death and hospitalization. In the real world, a very, very, very  few do die. 

If you’re vaccinated, COVID is a very negligible danger. You do far riskier activities like drive a car or walk down the street without a helmet on.

If you’re vaccinated (and not immunocompromised) masks are now bad overall. The risk is so low for physical safety that we must now consider the negative social implications of wearing a mask. 

Humans are social creatures who rely on facial expressions as part of the communication process. If you’re trying to hide, you need a psychologist not a mask. And if you’re trying to keep warm, buy a scarf. There is a slight risk from the flu, etc. But unless you are a physically sick individual: you’re harming yourself by wearing a mask. It harms society too, we lose out on the interactions, it harms our kids in school trying to learn vowels and socialization. It’s unnatural, we weren’t born with masks.

It was supposed to be temporary until science produced a solution—and it did.

Get vaccinated, ditch the mask. I’ll bet you’ll enjoy a warm summer day, a passing stranger’s smile more than you think. And perhaps you’ll find it freeing not feeling your own breath. 

But if not—-do you. Just don’t expect me to think it’s healthy or to respect your unhealthy choice. I’ll respect you—just not your mask."

There’s lots of irrational thinking out there. Wearing a mask ouside, wearing it in a car while driving alone, wearing it anywhere after being vaccinated (if you don’t trust the vaccine). All these things are judgements people make about risk. But other influences come into play. Notice how the Asians, since the SARS epidemic of 2002, have adopted masks into their culture. Worked for them. Notice even how masks have worked their way into the fashion world. Politics, of course, makes people stupid. People denied the mask and the virus itself. Then they died.

2021-05-17 22:49,"Dan Rather's question is the key point that the article fails to address: ""Why should people care if someone wants to wear a mask outside?""

Masks allow wearers to obscure their faces, and therefore make it more difficult for others to assess them in approach or passing. They inject an anti-social element into society and distance wearers from those around them. Further masked individuals are less accountable for their actions on account of being less recognizable. 

That is why people are opposed to others wearing them, particularly in a fashion so ridiculous like Mr. Glickman's routine.

Now, if the crowd is unmasked, everything changes: The elderly and the immune-compromised among us, and those who just are more risk-averse, will need to get better masks. Serious, N95 ones. But we can get them with exhale valves if we want that, because now it will be all about self-protection, and not for the common good.

For context, I am/was 100% mask compliant and will still wear it when a business, friend, stranger or law asks me to do so. But we waited 14 months for the vaccine while we followed the rules. I’m really not sure why this is a debate anymore."

While it seems that the odds of transmitting the disease once one has been vaccinated seem to be very low, there are enough breakthrough infections to make caution sensible. The unvaccinated can give the disease even to the vaccinated.

But I understand why people get angry at us. Wearing a mask symbolizes other things we aren't yet ready to do--eat indoors in restaurants, shop til we drop, or resume our old social patterns. And until we do those things, things won't be ""normal"" for the people who want things to get back to normal. Will their favorite restaurant survive if we're not patronizing it? Will store stocking get back to what they're used to?

I realize that not everyone can maintain such safety measures but I do have a few friends who have similarly rarely left their house during the last year.  I would like to get vaccinated to further reduce my risk but that would require me leaving my house. I dont think being overly cautious about Covid is unreasonable.

masks outside should of been lifted a long time ago - there's little evidence of outdoor spread. it makes sense in a crowd, such as a concert or protest, etc, but in casual settings with a small group of people or alone? pointless.

There are plenty of places that were done with this long ago, but not us. The anti-maskers and anti-lockdown folks probably won't ever realize that they are the main reason why this had gone on for so long and why so many people continue to die, but that's the reality. There are plenty of places where this is no longer a threat -- because people wore their masks. It is all so dumb.

2021-05-18 0:03,"According to the CDC if you are fully vaccinated your chances of getting or spreading Covid are virtually nil. Hence you don’t need to wear a mask. So if you go into, say, a restaurant where there are people who are not wearing masks it shouldn’t really matter to you whether they are fully vaccinated or not. 
If those unmasked people are not fully vaccinated then they are risking to contract or spreading Covid but that’s a risk that they would take knowingly and apparently willingly.  But their behavior wouldn’t affect my wellbeing as long as I know that I’m fully vaccinated. 
In sum, all this hubbub/confusion about mask rules is a manufactured problem: a rational person will always wear a mask if they are not fully vaccinated; an equally rational person will not wear a mask if they are fully vaccinated."

If the public had statistics about who died from the COVID, their health situations and where they are likely to have caught it, going forward, the public (well most of them) could make rational decisions.  Lacking that, some people will take all sorts of what looks to be irrational actions.  

It would also have been beneficial for the CDC to have said from near the outset that masks weren't necessary outside in well ventilated situations.

It may be ok to do some things as per the good of a group, while at the same time not be chosen by a specific person who doesn't want to expose themselves to a risk of contamination.

For one thing, the covid crisis has really helped me size what it means to think for oneself and the - sometimes vital - importance of making one's decisions accordingly, and to do so without caring too much about the approval of others.

Current studies do not measure vaccine efficacy in all people. Immunocompromised individuals and those who fail to develop antibodies were not assessed for vaccination efficacy. Until science addresses these populations, indoor masking is a cheap additional precaution."
2021-05-18 0:26,"I think I will always wear a mask on flights - in recent years I’ve been sick numerous times within a couple of days of a flight.  I wish masks would continue to be mandatory when flying.  People are in such close proximity, for many hours if flying internationally.  Perhaps there could be a section of the plane for those of us who prefer masks on international flights?"
2021-05-18 0:30,"Since these mask-off-if-vaccinated policies need to work on “the honor system,” I will be masking and distancing for the near future.  I don’t trust any stranger to do the right thing.  

As a New Yorker, I fully plan to mask on transit from now on.  Say what you want, but the MTA is a germ factory."
2021-05-18 0:31,When we were asked to mask up there was a lot less COVID and no vaccine. Now there is more COVID cases and a vaccine. I’d feel better about unmasking if scientists came to a conclusive decision about how long the vaccine will last.
2021-05-18 0:33,"I’m going to keep wearing mine in stores and other indoor places, and maybe in busy outdoor spaces.  And definitely during flu season and travel. Many people in my area are unvaccinated and will probably remain so. I don’t care to share their air space given the variants. I have not been retired very long and want to have a long healthy retirement. I don’t care what anyone says to me and besides, nobody notices older women, we are invisible."
2021-05-18 0:33,"I'm keeping mine for flu season. The flu takes a lot from this country. And people will come to work sick. Maybe we could mask away the flu. On a voluntary basis, of course. But let's just decide to do that. Keep the mask for when the flu comes back around. Lives and dollars will be saved."
2021-05-18 0:33,"When the CDC et al tell us it's safe to be unmasked if we've been vaccinated, several things come to mind.  First, both the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines are 91-95% effective, leaving 5-9% of us at risk? The J&J is said to be less effective.  Was the Pfizer vaccine kept at the proper very low temperature in all the clinics using it? Seniors may not produce the same antibody response as others following vaccination(I was offered an enhanced flu vaccine due to my senior status) and therefore may not be protected as well.
I assume long-term studies of the vaccine trial subjects are continuing to determine when a booster/new vaccine is needed, and I hope among those are enough seniors.  
Think I'll continue taking some precautions!
I'd be interested in the replies of real experts!"

If we keep wearing masks during cold and flu season, we'd probably have a lot fewer colds and flu."
2021-05-18 0:38,"I plan on continuing to wear a mask when in public where I don't know the vaccination status of others.

When I do return to the office, I will wear a mask when leaving my department.  I know my department is fully vaccinated as we have all been very open about our appointments. 

I like not being sick and if a masks lessens my odds of getting sick, I'm all in.

2021-05-18 0:42,"I live in Iowa, where there are many who don't mask up.  Strangely, I visted quite a few stores today (including one in a mall) and nearly everyone i encountered was masked.  It was refreshing.  I enjoy wearing my homespun masks and, although I am vaccinated, plan to continue doing so indefinitely - going from 2 masks (N95 + cloth) to 0 just doesn't seem right with the pandemic still raging, largely unabated, throughout much of the world."

2021-05-18 0:51,I work in the customer service area of Walmart and I have been wearing a mask since last March at work and everywhere else. Walmart is allowing fully vaccinated employees to stop wearing masks starting Tuesday but I still plan on wearing my mask at work. The primary reason is for my safety but a secondary reason is to prevent people from seeing me smirk at them when they are lying to me or when I tell them no and they get mad.
2021-05-18 0:53,"My mother who is almost 100  and still in good health has survived a lot. She advises still masking and I will take her advice over the CDC. My father lived an amazingly long life despite having rheumatic fever, sarcoidosis, smoking Chesterfields and working 20 hours a day. I am pretty sure if he was still alive to witness this he would still mask and  dare anyone to  approach him. 

We ignored them at the beginning of the pandemic and wore masks while enduring stares and will continue to do the same. Like my parents I dare anyone to come at me over my mask."
2021-05-18 0:53,"I haven't the slightest reservation about wearing my mask indoors for the foreseeable future. I also won't be dining indoors for a good while. My wife and daughter will join me in doing so. The only issue might be with my daughter probably being one of the only ones wearing a mask in school when the next school years starts - assuming the states relax the mask rules for schools. But I plan on enlisting her teacher to help her understand that the main reason we wear a mask is to protect other people. 

It's just incredible that 14 months on, this concept is lost on the legions still worried about their freedoms. 

The CDC and the Biden administration have made a HUGE miscalculation with their relaxing of the mask recommendations, not just in terms of being premature about letting down our guard but in terms of making the mask - again - a political issue. I imagine most conscientious people who are vaccinated will be still wearing masks indoors while everyone else will take advantage of this opportunity to never wear a mask again. We will undoubtedly be returning to a state of tension similar to what we saw at the beginning of the pandemic. More political strife added to a pandemic which is far from over."
2021-05-18 0:54,"I see nothing that has changed about the virus to change my wearing of a mask around others. I still stay a safe distance from others and wash my hands often. I don't know when I will feel safe enough not to wear a mask. 
Part of me wonders if this again new stance on whether to wear a mask or not is based on manipulation--first, it was no because essential workers didn't have enough masks to share with the public, then it was essential once the virus was out of control and masks became available, now it is because they want everybody vaccinated. I'm fully vaccinated, but I don't trust others to be. Not to forget: people have gotten the virus After being fully vaccinated. Why is that?"
2021-05-18 0:56,"Personally I really miss seeing people's faces. It helps communicate emotion and can communicate friendliness. I like that others know when I'm smiling at them and I like knowing when other people are smiling at me. This is true just generally speaking, but especially true if you're at a bar or something.
Also, I absolutely hated wearing a mask during the entire work day. It just feels exhausting. So I'm Very ready to unmask and get back to things as normal. Especially since I'm fully vaccinated.
That said, I do think I'll wear masks in the future if I feel under the weather or there's a year with a particularly contagious/bad flu going around. OR I'm a situation where I'm going to interact with a large elderly population. Probably when I go to hospitals/doctor appointments. 
And I have no judgements at all for anyone that wants to keep wearing a mask all the time. Even if they're still doing it in 5 years. It doesn't affect me what someone else wears. Let people do their own thing.

That said, I do feel weird about being lumped in with Anti-Science republicans who refused to wear a mask during this pandemic. It's hard to feel completely safe when so many Americans have shown they have no regard for the health/safety of their fellow citizens."
2021-05-18 1:07,"I've been wearing a mask for 6 years during flu season thanks to cancer and a compromised immune system.  It was really odd last winter for that short period of time when the ""convential wisdom"" being publicized was that wearing masks did not protect the wearer.  And in ""greater Nebraska"" (an oxymoron if there ever was one), the farther west of Lincoln and Omaha that you go, the less likely people are to wear masks (or be vaccinated). The vaccine is of limited effectiveness for those of us with hematologic cancers,  so I will continue to wear a mask."
2021-05-18 1:07,"I am a double organ transplant who works full time managing a regenerative medicine clinic where we treat a lot of post Covid issues.  I have had COVID twice and still have some long haul symptoms including headache, fatigue, brian fog and neuropathic pain.  I am fully vaccinated and still have no detectable antibodies.  I intend to continue masking for the foreseeable future given the number people who are not vaccinated, the variants, and other air borne viruses that will likely flare up when people stop masking.  I am shocked that the cdc would relax the mask standards with no provisions for proof of vaccination.  I fear it will promote more distrust and widen the political divide.  I’m comforted that some others will still mask and hope that we can all respect each other enough to be cool.  🙏  thank you for the article!"
2021-05-18 1:09,"Regarding masking for pandemic reasons: when we get to herd immunity,  and not just 40some percent of over-16s, I'll reconsider. 

However, my allergist has been after me for years to wear a surgical or tightly woven cloth mask when outside during allergy season (so 8 months of the year!) or cleaning inside. So l am grateful for these cool new mask options, and it's lessened both my seasonal misery and my formerly 3x a day claritin/zyrtec habit!"

I hope no one is bothered by that."
2021-05-17 23:59,"From day one of this pandemic I have been trusting in the science and avoiding the hysterical paranoia.  The epidemiology community warned us at the beginning that we need to avoid a peak load on the health care system, so promoting the idea of a lockdown, social distancing whatever.  It was not, and was never suggested, that we could avoid it.  In fact they warned us that by avoiding mild exposure to a wide range of pathogens made us more vulnerable, due to our immune system atrophying.

Forest bathing is believed to be one of the best ways to keep our immune system active and exercised. Our bodies have depended on this since the beginning of life on this planet.

All you mask wearers and retreaters; read the science, not the hype. You have been warned."
2021-05-18 0:05,I feel like the CDC caved to the GOP pressure. I will wear a mask indoors until we reach herd immunity and/or there is a viable oral treatment for Covid19. Even mild Covid19 is a problem. I personally like my taste buds and can't really afford to have chronic fatigue or brain fog.
2021-05-18 0:31,Congratulations to all the people who will continue to wear masks as a health measure.
2021-05-18 1:17,"It took a bit of time to get used to the mask. Now it’s part of our routine. One needs to be aware of the mask itself. Lots of folks seem to be handling it on both sides and reusing the mask for a long period of time. The quality of the mask makes a difference. Gosh the N95, made in the US is really expensive at $4, but seals fantastically. The k95 is much cheaper (Costco) and is very decent. The 3 and 4 ply disposables are the cheapest and least sealing. All these masks protect as long as you do not mistakenly touch stuff and people and then handle your mask, touch the outside of your mask and then touch the insides of your mask. When you place the same mask over your face, you introduce nasties in a rather closed environment. So we have been using all three, the cheapest for outdoors, so no tears when disposing. The k95 for interacting closely outdoors, a few tears when disposing it. The N95, is totally precious, only for indoor interactions, many tears shed as we dispose of the masks. Honestly, it’s kind of nice in our area with 75% with at least one vaccine. Working up our nerves to walk without a mask outdoors :-)). It’s a lot tougher to let go than a binky."
2021-05-18 0:36,"So the need to own a military assault rifle with a one hundred round clip to protect yourself against the mythical horde of invaders that’s certain to invade your home any minute now is cool…but to wear a mask to protect yourself against a virus that’s killed almost a million people in the United States alone with new variants forming as we speak infuriates people.  Yep, that’s the United States!"

After everything that has occurred and been said by Anti-Maskers & Anti-Vaxxers, everything that I have seen and experienced since last March, I definitely, Do Not Trust many of my fellow Americans, Trust that they will “ All of a Sudden” Do the Right Thing- Get Vaccinated or Wear a Mask. I have had recent Cancer treatments & my Wife is Immune Compromised. We will be wearing our N95’s for quite a while still, or until our vaccinated rates climb to were they should be. Even if we didn’t have health issues, we would still be wearing our masks when out."
2021-05-18 1:25,"The biggest issue I have with the latest CDC update is that the CDC of scientists, they should be advising, not  making policy decisions for the Government. 
The messaging was just awful out of the blue, blindsiding the President and contradicting everything we have been told to do for the past 15 months.
No we can not rely on Americans to follow an honor system , those who are vaccine phobic now have  the go ahead to not wear a mask. 
Meanwhile those of us who have been following the rules and got vaccinated fell like we have been slapped in the face .
It is time for the Federal Government to implement a plan for a Vaccine Passport nothing less will fix this mess."

Hiding behind a gun is brave while mask wearing is somehow cowardly. It starts with religion. Indoctrinated into magical thinking young, badgered to unquestioningly accept the most absurd assertion possible, after which nothing is too far fetched."
2021-05-18 0:23,"There's no backlash *against* people still wearing masks.  It's a fake controversy, and indeed, the article doesn't give examples of any actual backlash.  People who are vaccinated and trust the science may laugh inside at perma-maskers, but it doesn't go beyond that, any more than they would confront someone on the street wearing a clown suit."
2021-05-18 1:30,I will continue to mask also. I am on immunosuppressants post organ transplant but I believe even if that was not the case I would still mask. Not enough of the population has been vaccinated and we are not safely nearing herd immunity. While it is frustrating that we could not do it but it is also not surprising. People need to learn to mind their own business what concern should it be of others who masks still!

This is what norm I intend to adopt."

It was a problem when Trump politicized mask usage, and it a problem when liberals politicizing it’s removal.

 The way I see it, we will literally never hit herd immunity. Even if we can get 80-90% of the population to take the vaccine now (and we won’t), they won’t get the boosters that will be needed.

Low risk is not no risk and people, even fully vaccinated, have a risk of catching and passing on one of the more contagious strains of COVID, while children won't be fully vaccinated until next year.

I don't have problems going to a concert here in Florida with tons of people, or giving a hug or a kiss on the cheek to my friends. It seems weird that people are still paranoid, but because we were given the freedom to choose how we wanted to live, many of us didn't walk around wearing masks. Then again, how can you? Try working outdoors in 90 degree heat for hours and then get back with us. Once the mask gets saturated in sweat and you touch it, that sweat will go on everything you touch. It's not sanitary whatsoever! If you see people wearing a mask in Florida, then when they touch it, the sweat from the mask will go on the countertops, ATM machine keypads, etc. It's pretty disgusting if you ask me.

2021-05-18 2:06,I really don’t care what anyone thinks about me and it sounds like most commenters don’t either and will continue wearing masks for as long as they please.

Feels great to have some immunity and to be more relaxed. But not about to trust the CDC guidance that all of a sudden everything’s fine and we can take off the mask. I think this is a ploy to get more people vaccinated. I’m watching the news in India and Brazil. A pandemic is global, that’s what makes it a pandemic.

The only paragraph used to support this thesis is here: “ In interviews, vaccinated people who continue to wear masks said they are increasingly under pressure, especially in recent days; friends and family have urged them to relax, or even have suggested that they are paranoid.”

This is incredibly vague; essentially the “many people are saying” of reporting. 

Look at all the comments for this piece. I’d wager 95% are people who are going to keep wearing their masks or are supportive of those who do.

This feels like an under-reported piece pretending to highlight some national trend, that really just exists to encourage outraged comments/engagement (reminiscent of of all those “Trump voters in diners” stories)."

Where I live, the vast majority did not wear masks, or social distance, and our governor didn’t take the threat seriously. We are old. For a year, I masked up when I went out, which was every two weeks, at 7 a.m., for groceries. I wiped down the car handle, the groceries, the mail until scientists determined that the virus was not spreading via surfaces. I bought everything else, including bird seed, online. I did not go anywhere else, except to a son’s house, where we both wore masks. We ate outdoors when we were together, including at Thanksgiving and Christmas. Now, I observe the protocol that the establishment I am in prefers. I don’t mind wearing a mask, but I trust the science."

Do the math, but if it makes you feel safer to mask up for the next 5 years, go ahead and knock yourself out.￼  Look on the bright side.

If we look at NYT's own vaccination map, we see that many states (generally the deep red ones) are way behind on vaccinations. India is coming off of a major flareup, as are many south American countries. 

I'm thinking I'll see what happens this fall before I stop masking up indoors, and watch what the epidemiologists are doing. ""Everybody's doing it"" is not a good reason to behave in a risky manner. And, ultimately, it's just a paper rectangle. It's not like I'm walking around with my pants unzipped. Right?"

Given the latest guidance, it seems safe for a fully vaccinated teen to spend time indoors with other teens even if they are not vaccinated. I’m also concerned about the ethics of potentially exposing our friends’ youngest child to Covid given that vaccinated kids can still carry and transmit the virus. 

I haven’t seen any information about older teens (16-17) and younger teens (12-15) who are vaccinated spending extended time indoors with unvaccinated friends. It’s difficult since several of my kids’ friends are unlikely to get vaccinated and don’t follow mask guidelines, whereas we have been very cautious for family reasons.

Thank you for the clear & straightforward info. More is needed about what kids can and cannot do as we move forward."

2021-05-23 10:45,"Here are are a few more things folks need to know about COVID and kids: 

-Kids infect less than adults. Multiple studies peg kids’ R0 (the average number of people they infect) at less than one, meaning if covid circulated only among kids it would die out.

-Vaccinating adults protects kids. See what happened to kids’ cases in Israel and the UK. Send vaccines abroad to the adults abroad who need them. 

-the NYT reported yesterday that some teens are getting myocarditis (heart inflammation) after the vaccine. 

Multiple doctors have warned that we shouldn’t rush vaccines to kids under an Emergency Use Authorization because of these points. The risk/benefit calculus for kids is fundamentally different than for adults.

Which would be much less annoying if:

1. American embassies and consulates were providing proper services, but they are not, allegedly due to COVID, EVEN THOUGH all staff has been vaccinated.

2. The US government didn’t expect me to pay taxes. The US is the only country in the world (aside from Eritrea) that requires its citizens abroad to pay taxes on income earned anywhere in the world, IN ADDITION to the taxes they pay in their country of residence. At the same time the US government provides zero services to it’s citizens abroad, even in good times. In pandemic times, it’s even worse (see 1).

2021-05-24 17:28,"I think in children it is very important to separate by age. Young children (up to age 4) get sick extremely rarely, even IF they test positive. The older a child gets, the higher the chances of this child getting sick and the more likely the illness will be severe. But even in teenagers, severe covid (or death) is very rare.
Therefore, vaccination recommendations, as well as any other covid regulations for children, should be age-specific. The CDC mashing anyone under 18 into one large group is not keeping up with the research. And it is fear-mongering. For young children, covid is mostly like the flu.
Before we suggest that all children should be vaccinated with a vaccination that has not been tested on many children or long-term, we should make sure that all adults get their shots. Vaccinated adults protect children well. Vaccinating all children (and possibly requiring this for regular schooling) is making children, who don't get as sick from covid, do the work the adults are too worried to do themselves. It's easy to make children do this because they require schooling. They need to see their friends for a healthy development. And parents need this, too. But it should be a choice because, for the most part, children under 12 don't get as sick, don't spread the virus as much, and are protected by the adults in their lives being vaccinated."

Get your kids vaccinated just like you did for measles and whooping cough.

So vaccinate your kids so they can resume their normal lives, sleepovers, school activities and aren’t forced to sit things out due to your overblown fears.

First, children can carry without very dire symptoms new variants of the virus my vaccine might not be able to handle. Second, if I go about as I did with many unmasked unvaccinated people in my city area that attracts tourists, I could carry a variant that can infect children and have dire results we can't know about.  Third, I have heard of incidents where parents who need to work outside their homes send children to day care and school with what they try to rationalize as ""allergies"" or ""a cold"" that ultimately turns out to be COVID-19 to spread to other children, their parents, and all of us."

2021-08-12 23:23,"What the current media spin covers up, is the same thing it did on the first issue for kids.  It's a medical experiment. . . on your children.  

They were unable to find adequate volunteers or injuries to test on children.  That makes sense.  No parents were willing to do it.  So they intend to sneak it past the press and public as an emergency issue auth, while the press, as in this article, and they, in their website and announcement, gloss over and otherwise misdirect parents attention from the key point, that they haven't tested it for young children.

We couldn't find child volunteers to test it, so we're issuing it and uninforming you into being the guinea pigs, by withholding the important detail that it will be untested in children, until enough parents are ""convinced"" into taking the ""emergency issue,"" whether they are informed of the lack of testing or not.

Thus, they avoid the more important discussions which naturally arise, when you fully and adequately inform these parents they will be participating in a medical experiment on their children, one they could not find volunteers for, and one they seem to want people to not know, that it is untested in children.  Questions like, how illness/vaccine already is affecting children and in what ways.

Your children will be the experiment on emergency issue/EUA drugs, they will become the phase 3 trial.

My kids and I thank you, sympathetically, because we will be waiting until it is tested.  First."
2021-10-06 18:46,"Our son will turn 12 in February. I am wondering if we should  wait till then so he gets the higher dosage of the vaccine? And if he gets a 3rd shot -eventually maybe- will they switch him over to the higher dosage for that one given he for sure will be 12 then? Depending on when when the vaccine really comes out, he might already be eligible for a higher dosage for his 2nd shot? Doubt that that was researched. If we wait (or lie about his age now) he can get the higher dosage for all shots. Can't imagine there is phenomenal change in his body in the next 2 months. They can't rule out pericarditis or myocardatis even with a smaller dosage."
2021-10-12 13:26,There is an additional concern for children who previously contracted the virus; the vaccine has been tested for safety in children who have not contacted the virus it has not been tested for safety in children who previously contracted the virus. This is similar to the booster shot needing to show it is safe in order to get approval.
2021-10-12 17:19,"Came across this article from only a few months ago as I consider pros / cons of getting my 8 and 9 year old vaccinated - and one thing is for certain: the amount of certainty in many of the comments from May show how much we still are learning, and how humble we should be about our ""certainty."" Then we thought the vaccine offered bulletproof resistance to transmission / now we know it does not (though it does protect against severe disease). Then we thought that vaccination would allow you to return to a normal life / now we know that the vaccinated are not functionally treated any differently than the unvaccinated (despite being safe from severe disease and every adult at risk has had the opportunity to be vaccinated). But the one thing we've known for a while is that kids don't face any extraordinary risk from Covid. In fact that data is stronger now than then. I don't think there's any serious risk in kids getting the vaccine, but I don't really see any benefit either - so it makes the whole risk/benefit analysis tough. Can someone help me see the clear benefit?"
2021-10-12 17:35,"In the end, there is STILL a risk that a child could be not that sick (or not sick at all but still infected) and spread the virus to the elderly or people with compromised immunity (from auto immune diseases or transplants). I have personal knowledge of people with those two situations. Maybe vaccines don't protect completely against transmission but they do make a difference."
2021-10-13 16:57,"I have 2 children, one under 11 and the other under 5. I relate to parents who are struggling with the uncertainty surrounding Covid. With a background in healthcare, I can understand the scientific concepts shared here and elsewhere about mRNA vaccines. I don’t have specific concerns outside of the known risks of vaccines generally (ie. allergic reactions, etc.). I agree with scientists who assert that the risks of Covid vaccines are somewhat predictable generally, but unknown from child-to-child.

What I’m more concerned about and interested in is what do we know about Covid-19 and the potential for the virus to manifest long-term issues. The chicken pox virus lies dormant for decades, but can cause shingles in later-life. Herpes simplex, the virus that causes cold sores, remains in the body and can flare up during stressful periods throughout one’s life. Given these examples and many others, what does the science predict about Covid in the long-run?

This fear keeps me from going back to our pre-Covid ways with my kids and letting nature run its course if they become infected. We choose to socialize less, especially during our Michigan winters. We have forgone visits with my ailing grandma if we have Covid symptoms. It’s been a difficult fall because allergy symptoms overlap Covid symptoms. Continued practices to reduce potential exposure to Covid are costly to my family, but we don’t know the cost of contracting Covid & my kids have their whole lives ahead of them."
2021-10-26 14:14,"We have a very tall (>5'5"") 11-year old. It seems odd that he would get the same dose as a 5-year old and not a much smaller 12 year-old. 

What is the strategy for these borderline kids? Will they get a booster at 12? Should they wait until they are 12 to get a shot?"
2021-11-07 22:17,"Vaccine safety protocols were developed over decades, for very good reasons (check the well-documented history!). However, we can all - obviously - rest assured that if the Biden regime and CDC have tossed them aside and are prepared to inject our children and grandchildren with experimental vaccines for which there is no mid- or long-term safety data, they must have  billions of very good reasons for doing so. We know we can trust Pharma and politicians!"
2021-11-09 12:43,"I fail to understand why tens of thousands of Americans, many of them unvaccinated, are now attending professional football games -- sitting together cheek by jowl, virtually in each other's laps, spreading the virus hither and yon, before bringing it home to their kids.

I like football too, but this is nuts."
2021-11-24 15:11,"I'll start with the obligatory ""I'm vaccinated, and I'm not by any means an Anti-Vaxxer' but...""

The fact that, as one commenter put it  the vaccine has been ""administered to hundreds of millions of people with all sorts of medical history"" still doesn't make up for the fact that there have been NO LONG-TERM STUDIES, because, of course, that's impossible right now. 

mRNA treatments were being tested in rats when I was graduating high school (1990!) That doesn't feel like that long to me. The first clinical trial was around 2013 (You can check this in the journal 'Nature' that's where I found it.)

There is a nuanced position here. 

You can have faith in science and medicine but also understand that the medical establishment is not infallible. Just ask anyone who took Thalidomide, used a Dalkon Shield or was prescribed an opioid. 

Being hesitant to vaccinate your kids against Covid doesn't necessarily make you a misinformation-consuming ignoramus or a selfish jerk who doesn't care about the greater good. 

I know the long-term effects of Covid on kidsare also unknown. To many parents I'm talking to, having to make this decision feels like a choice between Cholera and The Plague.

There are unknowns."
2021-05-21 10:12,"THX-1138, the movie released in 1968, predicted remote medicine for mental conditions. The talking medicine cabinet dispensed advice, and drugs too! Have we not evolved?"
2021-05-21 10:39,"Teletherapy has made possible access to a specialized therapist for my daughter. We live in NJ, just outside Manhattan, but getting to a therapist who specializes in treating panic disorder was just not reasonable. Pre-pandemic, we didn't have the time to pack up after school and work, and battle traffic for over an hour to go into the city. That would have been a 3+ hour roundtrip. With Zoom therapy as the only option for all therapy, we were able to access the specialist she needed.

The cost, however, is unchanged. A NYC therapy ""hour"" still costs $250, whereas a the same hour in NJ costs $150. The expense was not covered by my insurance. So, while the best therapists are now accessible, they are still priced out of reach for most."
2021-05-21 11:00,"""If my therapist is reading this (and if she isn’t, do we have a problem?), she is about to learn that I spent part of our last phone session folding the laundry. In her office, my mind would have wandered to the mess I had left behind . . . .""

If that's the case, it's time for you to stop wasting money. At one point, continuing to see a therapist for essentially the same old all-consuming personality or situational problem is like scratching a scab. 

Folding laundry or, say, polishing silver or tackling a messy closet -- that is, getting things done -- is the best therapy for most of us. 

(Given that my grandmother underwent electric-shock therapy at Payne Whitney throughout the 1960s, and a cousin took medication for depression, I do understand that clipping the hedges does not work for everyone.)"
2021-05-21 11:20,"I've been a Jungian Analyst and run two therapy groups for about 35 years.  On Zoom, my groups and my work with couples are just as lively and just as effective. Zoom (or the phone) eliminates the pomp and ceremony that, though it may help, is not the real substance. The verbal and non-verbal conversation, the emotions, the relationship, all that continues."
2021-05-21 16:05,"Yes as one afflicted by depression since the 1990s I can attest to the fact that psychiatric and therapeutic care via Zoom and it’s prodigy in the Covid age has made access to treatment readily, immediately and effectively available removing from patients the stress of sitting in crowded waiting rooms, waiting for  quickly needed urgent care or getting to appointments in inclement weather on and on."
2021-05-21 19:23,"A therapy session happens on many levels, quite a few of which are missing on video, and effective therapists are finding creative ways to compensate. Fees won’t go down because the therapist works much harder to connect with the patient, and we know from the research that this connection is what makes therapy successful.

Working online, absent the nonverbal cues one gets when physically present, the therapist needs to focus more intensely to understand the patient.  She also does more explaining and empathizing explicitly  in words."
2021-05-21 22:02,"Similar to psychologists, as a speech therapist I can honestly say covid has changed my practice for the better.  I was skeptical at first that teletherapy could work for my pediatric clients, but for most it has and I love being a teletherapist.   No office overhead, fewer scheduling headaches and best of all, more parent involvement for carryover of skills."
2021-05-22 3:11,"With fewer cancellations, no need for a receptionist/front office, etc., could we finally see the cost of psychotherapy come down from $250+ per hour?"
2021-05-22 3:15,"As a psychotherapist I found teletherapy to be a wonderful avenue to see clients. I love it and I think they do too. It makes me laugh that tele therapy was seen by regulatory and government agencies as a less adequate, somewhat suspect, way to see clients before the pandemic. Nothing like a crisis to lead to change; that's kind of the dynamics of therapy!  What I found is that many, if not most, clients seem more comfortable talking about difficult topics when they are in their own environment.  I will continue seeing clients via teletherapy for the foreseeable future."
2021-05-22 3:21,"Regarding the photo accompanying the article.

Apparently whomever chose it doesn't know anything about the psychotherapy most people are in now.  Very few are in the psychoanalysis shown by the photo with the analyst sitting out of sight of the patient and I doubt any analysts today have offices like that shown in the phot.

I would wonder if to accompany an article on modern surgery an editor would choose one showing surgery before surgeons used masks or gloves.

Finally, I should point out that term therapists cover a wide range of professions.  The only ones who are physicians are psychiatrists.  Physical disorders can present with psychological symptoms and mental disorders can present with physical ones.  Without medical training, few non-psychiatrist therapists are able to differentiate between them"
2021-05-22 10:44,"Yes. Having a therapy session from your home has been so helpful during these past 14 months. I do understand why the majority of my patients will want to continue that way. My concern is the patients that live near my office and can safely walk a few blocks to my office. They want to continue their sessions at home even though they have no families to take care of and no work schedule to negotiate. 
Just as we will need time to adjust to taking our mask off outside, I think some people are having a hard time adjusting to seeing people in person. Over time I will be encouraging my local patients to see me in my office as a way of helping them adjust to connecting with people in person."
2021-05-22 10:59,"I have a very long term depressive disorder, treated with psychotherapy and medications. Much of my life has been spent overseas, typically in Africa, and, after having established an in-person relationship with my therapist, I have done well with quarterly telephone calls and roughly annual in-person visits when I'm in town. We continued this over the past year. Not as good, perhaps, as Zoom, but it has worked for me."
2021-05-22 11:02,"Both telehealth and face-to-face therapy are needed. I do therapy with the elderly, people in hospice, medically ill, and people with different abilities. Not everyone can see or hear well enough for telehealth to be helpful. Not everyone can easily pick up and operate a phone or tablet. Therapy needs to be accessible to everybody and it’s good we have different ways to accommodate these days."
2021-05-22 11:03,"I work in college mental health as a counselor and practicing tele therapy during the pandemic has increased access to counseling for many underserved populations. Even though it took awhile for students to start or reconnect with counseling, this spring semester has been as nearly as full as my pre-pandemic schedule. At the same time as much as college students are technically savvy, they still long for in person counseling for which me and my colleagues will be able to do so due to a recent announcement mandating vaccinations for all students, faculty and staff. We plan to still offer tele therapy to continue increasing access as well increase ease to attend counseling for commuters and those who live off campus."
2021-05-22 11:28,"As a long-time (25  years) consumer of several modalities, I find remote sessions to be a poor substitute. If I hadn't established strong prior face-to-face relationships with my therapists before we migrated to Zoom, the pandemic sessions wouldn't have been at all helpful. Both my therapists and I have noted that we are less effective, bi-directionally, in reading and intuiting each other through screens."
2021-05-22 11:29,"Tele-health worked in a crisis.  I, however, am ready to return to face-to-face sessions in the therapist's office.  The drive to and from the office, the office-space rituals, etc. -- these elements delineate the experience in ways that help me  to prepare for and then continue to process the session after it ends unlike a computer-screen home session where I never escape the chores of daily life.  I'm thankful for the continued therapy during the pandemic, but I am tired of working, socializing, and ""going to the doctor"" in front of a screen."
2021-05-22 11:30,"I am trained in somatic, experiential mindful psychotherapy.  This tradition centralizes the wisdom of the body and the felt sense of emotions in the body -- not as peripheral -- but as the central aspect of the psychotherapeutic process. 

In this tradition, what happens in a person's pre-frontal cortex, the explanations we give ourselves for why we feel the way we do, the stories we tell ourselves about our personal histories, the meaning of our lives or our innate worth are seen merely as manifestations of endlessly repeating internal tapes that blather on without respite.  What ordinary ""talk therapy"" prizes -- a discursive analysis of things -- is seen as an impediment to deeper inquiry.   

Therapy in this tradition is immediate and physical, with people doing small experiments in mindfulness, standing, sitting, walking, reaching, rolling around on cushioned floors, snuggling up to blankets and comforts and the like to explore core physiological senses of themselves with concomitant mental explanations.

While not impossible, it's difficult to do these types of ""whole person"" things over Zoom.  Therapy is an intimate encounter between people, and most people are not wired for intimacy over the technology.  To ""sell"" such an experience as a therapist, you have to be sensitive to a lot of techniques and strategies used in the film industry -- lighting, framing, looking into the camera, audio fidelity, background nose, camera distance.

Get this stuff correct is a pain."
2021-05-22 11:44,"Zoom is fine when people have limited access to therapists but otherwise is a poor substitute for in vivo treatment. It is especially a very marginal intervention for many children who already have spent untold screen hours because  of school closings and part-time schedules. The rise of telehealth practices offering treatment with often marginally trained clinicians is on the rise and it remains to be seen how effective or appropriate these are. In-person talk therapy has been endorsed by robust studies and it will be necessary to do the same with telehealth therapy if it is to remain a  viable treatment option in lieu of in vivo treatment. As for me, no comparison - a real clinician is to be preferred always."
2021-05-22 11:46,"I much much much prefer therapy by phone or Zoom There are so many fewer distractions I don't have to sit around thinking about what the therapist is wearing or what I'm wearing or if the therapist looks botheres or bored or who is coming into the parking lot or who can hear me in the next room or analyzing where the chairs are and why, an endless amount of things 
This way as soon as we start-- it's on"
2021-05-22 11:47,"There is so much more to ""talk"" therapy than just the talk, and much of it does not translate via video. As a psychologist in in-person sessions, I can ""sense"" how you are feeling and guide sessions to go deeper based on this ""therapist use of self."" 

This deeper, emotional aspect does not translate via video, and it is what my clients are referring to when they tell me that after seeing multiple therapists they are finally making progress and finding healing in our sessions. 

I found myself doing much more ""teaching"" than ""therapy"" during the pandemic, as  I found video session lend themselves to cognitive behavioral treatments, but not others. 

I also suspect video no-shows will increase as people return to work and COVID restrictions ease. Someone folding their clothes during a session is not focusing on themselves or their therapy. And you're not fooling your therapist at all."
2021-05-22 12:23,"For me, cutting out time traveling, session preliminaries & aftermath, dealing with office procedures and allowing my therapeutic identity and searching to blend within my home environment has been a refreshing change.
Some people may believe that arousing anxiety, sometimes inherent in an office environment, is helpful to the process however I feel that being in a more natural setting with some choice and freedom of movement allows for better exploration and perhaps a more egalitarian relationship.  It's possible that some of the nuances of a visual in person settling is lost, however there may also be a gain in feeling less rushed and corresponding ability to look within."
2021-05-22 12:38,"I have been seeing clients - couples and individuals - via teletherapy now for 14 months, and many of my clients wish to continue in this modality. Accessibility is key. They do not have to find child care, take two hours out of their day, find a parking place in a busy downtown location, or deal with bad weather. I had zero no-shows and very few late cancellations during the pandemic. In a state where frequently sessions had to be cancelled due to poor driving conditions in the winter, this became a non-issue and clients could continue to get the services they needed. Some clients do wish to meet in person again, so I will be continuing with a hybrid model. My clients and I pivoted and worked hard for over a year to change our behaviors and expectations around teletherapy and have found that, like other aspects of post pandemic life, we don’t want to go back to the “before times.” Whether insurance will continue to cover teletherapy post-pandemic  is another matter that appears to be unclear."
2021-05-22 12:47,"The outdated photo used to accompany this article continues to perpetuate the negative stereotypes that mental health professionals are trying to break down and remove from our society. Why would the NYT pass up an opportunity to present the current mental health office in today's updated design. The majority of practitioners and and colleagues that I know take painstaking time, effort and money to create an atmosphere that is conducive for building relationships, while at the same time offering a safe space for a patient or client to feel comfortable while disclosing painful and intimate details of their lives."
2021-05-22 12:52,Now we have choices.  Zoom or in person.  This is a good thing.
2021-05-22 13:04,"There is an additional benefit to Zoom treatment: it establishes more equality between client and therapist.  Pardon the pun but that's a net benefit.  The therapist is not ""hosting"" the client and the client is not having to disrupt her life to obtain treatment. 

In the heyday of psychoanalysis, long since past, it was commonly believed that therapy should take precedence over almost every element of a person's life.  The client was told to take her vacation in August when the analyst did, and could be charged for taking it at another time.  If the analyst said that the patient could only get better if he came five days a week, at great expense and disruption of work and family life, then it was considered evidence of lack of motivation if the patient demurred.  Most of this nonsense, thankfully, has disappeared but the ethos of inequality has persisted.  Some clients find the implicit inequality comforting but ultimately it's disempowering. 

Tele-therapy levels the playing field.  When a treatment session can be fit into the interstices of a person's work or family life, when it no longer entails a time-consuming and sometimes costly commute, when the client no longer has to tell her boss she has a weekly dental appointment to protect her privacy, therapy is not only more convenient but, by requiring less sacrifice, restores agency and power to the patient ."
2021-05-22 13:05,"A a social worker who provides psychotherapy to low income NYers at a Federally Qualified Health Center, I am disappointed to see the continued perpetuation of the myth that therapy is only for a certain segment of the population that is on display in this article. ""The working well"" are not the only people who receive and benefit from psychotherapy, my clients are a diverse set of people who cannot be defined by their class status or diagnosis , though many reside in homeless shelters, are living on the street, and manage symptoms of schizophrenia and/or substance use. The majority of my clients are unable to participate in therapy virtually, either because they don't have access to the technology required to do so, or because they don't live in a space anywhere conducive to having a virtual session.
I agree that what traditional psychotherapy looks like for many people is shifting (and somewhat for the better), but also wish that as a society we could be more open-minded and realistic about who psychotherapy is ""appropriate"" for."
2021-05-22 13:05,"I'm a psychologist now in retirement from clinical practice, having worked in the field for 30+ years.  I've worked in a small metropolitan area as well as in a semi-rural area.  Especially to increase access to behavioral health care, remote service through technology has been used in this geographical area. 
 In any case, this essay is an excellent summary of this topic, even as it takes into consideration the area of primary focus being Manhattan."
2021-05-22 13:15,"My concern for telehealth is the client who struggles with  anxiety or those who withdraw deeply into their own worlds. Telehealth does nothing to exercise being out in public while regulating themselves. Therapy is about recovery and gaining new skills and in this way, it’s not helpful."
2021-05-22 13:37,"This article is full of excellent points. But I have another. Telephone and online therapy provide consistency of care for clients who move. I did this as early as the 80's.
I am retired now, but when I practiced, I offered pro-bono and vastly reduced fees to many patients. This was in line with the ethical mandate of my profession, Clinical Psychology, which required that 10% of my work be pro bono/"
2021-05-22 13:46,I was hoping you’d say some therapists finally realized that systemic forces outside any individual’s control can affect their well being.
2021-05-22 13:58,"I have found as a patient that I feel a greater disconnect between myself and my therapist during Zoom appointments. And even with my self view off, I feel much more self conscious than I do in person. Yes, I like that I don't have to drive. But instead I have my kids outside the door, or I drive to a parking lot with wifi to either freeze or suffocate in the heat. I actually have really preferred the sessions when the wifi doesn't work and we talk on the phone. 

 In general, I've found Zoom is great but has drawbacks for sure."
2021-05-22 14:06,"I'm a psychologist, and the simple fact is that with nearly 600,000 Covid-19 deaths there will be an estimated over five million family members and friends in need of mental health treatment. There are simply not enough therapists, especially therapists of color, or crisis counselors available nor can most afford or have access to them. Instead, grieving survivors will be left to search the web for the few sites that can provide the help and relief they need."
2021-05-22 14:10,"I am so over telehealth! Video visits with a health professional may be adequate for a prescription renewals, and they work well in mental health care for an acute crisis (which before Covid would likely be handled with a phone call), but not they aren’t adequate for much more than that. A (good) therapist needs to be able to feel the energy in a room and read a patient’s body language. This is especially true in couples therapy, where the interaction among participants is all. If a patient/client is folding laundry while talking to her therapist, she is paying (or her insurance is paying) for a chat with a hired friend. Ridiculous."
2021-05-22 14:16,"As a clinical psychologist who managed the access point of a public mental health program for an underserved, seriously ill population for many years, I feel very positively about the changes in service delivery described in this article.  Access to care is a key issue in mental health.  I witnessed over and over how difficult it was for some of the most vulnerable, needy clients to get to therapy, not necessarily due to ""resistance"" but because of transportation issues, childcare issues, etc.  It is high time the system adapted to clients' needs rather than pathologize folks for not using the services as narrowly defined.   Here in California, MediCal and Medicare have been forced to cover telephone and zoom services, making it possible for clients to be met ""where they're at"" to get the care they need and want.  And people can be served by anyone, anywhere, if it's a good fit, instead of being limited to the providers with offices nearby.  I have hope that providers, not having to spend the money on office space, can offer lower cost services to those who need help but can't afford a high hourly rate.  Yes there are losses, but access is so important to mental health, and the gains in access and participation, and the broadened, more flexible definitions of what therapy means, are good news for clients, which I think is good news for clinicians too."
2021-05-22 14:27,"I have been providing telehealth for couples and individuals and find myself working harder and somewhat less effectively than when seeing clients in the office.  Spotty Internet connections result in Max Headroom impersonations, missing nonverbal cues- newly developed gait disturbance, fidgeting limbs outside the video frame, unseen cutting scars, how clients would arrange the objects on the table- hinder complete and accurate diagnosing, not to mention privacy issues of clients talking in closets or in their car that alter the content of what they would normally process in the office.  I am in favor of hybrid model going forward, but will clearly explain the drawbacks for telehealth to my clients.  Lastly, I await to hear what policy changes the for-profit insurance companies will make which directly affect my paycheck.  It is so disheartening to know a car mechanic can charge and receive a much greater labor rate than a licensed psychotherapist gets reimbursed by insurance."
2021-05-22 14:32,"I can only speak for myself, of course, but I just don't get it. Online threrpy has made my experience basically useless. Maybe I'm an outlier but that's my take on it. I discontinued sessions several months ago because I find no connection other than wasting a quarter of the time slot talking about technical adjustments. How can a therepist see facial expression and body language under such conditions. For me, there's an amout of trust that's lost. Not every image of a person's inner workings can be experssed in words alone let alone words that can only be percieved between 1000 and 8000 hz. The availability of therapists in person is much smaller now and I will continue without one until something trustable and useful emerges again. So far, I'm still here."
2021-05-22 14:41,"I've been doing telepsychiatry for over a year now, and I'm not going back to in-person visits unless I have to. (Depends on what the DEA does with the regulations that were suspended during COVID.) I have patients now from hundreds of miles away, who are able to finally access psychiatric care. I also have many local patients who do not care to drive into the city, pay to park, deal with the noise, etc. They have told me repeatedly how much easier it has been to see me from their home, office or car. And frankly, I don't miss the commute and associated costs, either."
2021-05-22 15:00,"Teletherapy can be terrific, or it can be a complete waste.

Live sessions can be amazing, or not.

I am able to access an internationally-known therapist online to address a rare disorder, then travel to her for some live sessions through the year.

The live sessions are much more productive than the online sessions.  And this is with someone who is tops in their field, training other therapists in some highly technical approaches. 

Hybrid is working for me.  Would I do hybrid with a mediocre therapist?

Not a chance."
2021-05-22 15:05,The pandemic created a line for everyone and everything. Colleges have become more cognizant of offering face-to-face and online classes. And I believe the same will follow for therapy. Professionals should offer an option.
2021-05-22 15:16,"I have felt increasingly frustrated with the technical problems impacting therapy during the pandemic.  

I am a therapist and transitioned to seeing clients either by phone or video  this last year.  I have had consistent problems with wi-fi and internet connection.  I sublet an office and a direct, wired connection to the internet is not possible for me currently.  Our office suite upgraded our internet plan for better upload and download data speeds and this helped a bit.  I also have tried various extenders to improve the wi-fi connection.  Still, there are cut-outs, freezes, distortions and slowed speech and video impacting many sessions.  Sometimes, I will have a few sessions in a row where there seem to be no glitches at all.  Other times, I experience a few glitches per session for hours. 

Sometimes, I am unsure if the connection issue is on my end or my client's end. Sometimes, the freeze is so brief, it seems disruptive to mention it, but then I don't really know if my client experienced the glitch or not... 

At least half of my clients have reported ""zoom fatigue"" due to being on video for their work and requested phone sessions instead.  Tech issues are less of a problem with phone, but there can be issues with cell reception.  I do notice the difference between therapy in-person and via video - there is less vitality and emotional ""aliveness"" during video and phone sessions."
2021-05-22 15:17,"I have spent many years in therapy. The Zoom version simply isn’t real therapy. How are you supposed to have a true connection when you can’t feel the other person’s energy in the room?￼￼ and how are you supposed to relax and sink into that connected space when you’re trying to manage computer logistics, while your therapist is squinting to see what you’ve got in the background and making comments about your decor? I’m fine with doing telehealth with my PCP. But therapy needs to be a lot more emotionally connected, and people who think they’re getting “real” therapy via zoom are deluding themselves.￼￼￼￼￼ Our culture’s tendency is to make more and more things digital or robotic, even that which was never meant to be digitized. And as a result, we lose so very much.￼"
2021-05-22 15:19,"The first time I saw my therapist online, I had a closeup view of her forehead. The second time, the audio kept dropping out. I hated it, and more than that, I hated the reason we had to do it that way. But a year later, I've found it to be a more intimate experience. Even though we're not in the same room, the small screen of my laptop gives the illusion of being physically closer, as if our faces are mere inches apart. And that has gradually led to a more casual, open relationship, one that I hope to carry into in-person sessions when the time comes."
2021-05-22 15:22,"I have PTSD and dissociation. Zoom is impossible without a mild sedative. It is like a spinning, distant funhouse mirror experience. I phone my therapist, which still feels like a distant experience.  I recognize the value of remote sessions for others, and hope that any advantages discovered in the Pandemic can translate to better availability of therapy for others."
2021-05-22 15:30,"The thought of paying $250 an hour is more than enough to cure me. Now, that was easy, wasn't it."
2021-05-22 15:34,"Nothing but hallelujahs here. I work as a psychotherapist and for me, it's been a blessing. No more driving 3 hours total, to and fro the office, exhausted from L.A. traffic; no extreme stress over late clients trying to find parking (don't even get me started on West Hollywood), late Uber drivers; the 50 minutes that feel extremely punishing to both client and therapist, just when something important is being revealed; the 3 minutes for post therapy notes, and the 2 minutes running downstairs to the crummy restroom, with the mad dash to the next client. And all the ""new"" clients since the pandemic began, are happily ensconced in their own space, mostly stress-free around the ""therapeutic frame."" I'm in their living room, they're in my home office. We can talk freely, with no one else in the waiting room. I often give about 20 minutes extra, at no charge, and clients are beyond appreciative. No one else in the waiting room - I can schedule from 9am to 9pm if I want to. But I'm also a Zoom hater - it's not encrypted, btw - and there can be technical issues. Instead, I use FaceTime or Skype, because I'm not in any insurance network. So for those very few clients who still want ""in person,"" I see them in my back yard, or even out in nature - on the beach. It's a privilege I never knew existed."
2021-05-22 15:36,"Why not both? What I see emerging in my practice is a hybrid, a varying combination of in-person therapy and teletherapy. Both have advantages and disadvantages. 

Now I am seeing new patients initially at my office and then, depending on the situation, either in vivo or online. So far, it’s working well, perhaps better, for everyone."
2021-05-22 15:36,"Almost 20 years ago, my husband and I went for marriage counseling.  We attended joint sessions and then the therapist would meet with each of us separately.  After several episodes of missing my session because I was stuck at the office or in traffic, I asked if we could meet by phone.  I found it much more relaxing and was able to focus on the therapy.  It reduced my stress over being late or missing work or therapy and let me concentrate on what was going on in my marriage.  My therapist said that in order to get paid she had to bill the sessions as if I was there in person, so she did.  

By the pandemic, I had long ago given up therapy, but my husband still went.  He missed the first few months in the pandemic and I could tell he was suffering from therapy withdrawal.  I urged him to do telehealth when our carrier began offering it and he now does a weekly video session with his therapist.  One of us leaves the house for that hour so he has privacy and he seems to be really enjoying  it.  Just now, he texted me that he was on his way to do an errand I'd requested that he'd been putting off because his therapist told him to do it while I am away visiting family.  I hope that my husband continues virtually even after COVID because one hour spent is a lot better than 2 1/2 - 3."

2021-05-22 15:43,"I notice that in both the article and in many of the letters there seems to be an assumption that the better therapists are the ones who charge more money and work in the better neighborhoods. I wonder if this is really true. Or is it all part of that phenomenon that makes the pleasure centers of  people's brains light up when they're told (falsely) that the wine they're drinking is very expensive. In my case the worst therapist I ever went to was in private practice on the Upper East Side. I only went a few sessions, and looking back I should have reported her for unethical behavior. That said, I have worked for over 30 years as a clinical social worker in community based mental health clinics. Since the pandemic started I've used whatever remote method works best for the client. What I've found is that when one sense is cut off another one kicks into high gear. I imagine that it's the same as when a person loses their sight - their sense of hearing becomes more acute. It made me aware that sometimes what we see can also become a distraction. But other times the spoken word can hide what the visual reveals.  At any rate, I see the value in both virtual and in-person visits."
2021-05-22 15:46,"Doing therapy is not like some other job where I can be interrupted if needed. In March of 2020 when I moved my practice online and worked from home, I quickly found out that it didn’t work. From Amazon deliveries to service people to the neighbors and the dog, there are so many distractions and disruptions at home that I needed to barricade myself in my home office and hope that someone or something didn’t break into a session and derail it. Since April of 2020, I’ve been back in my downtown office where the only thing in the room is the therapy."
2021-05-22 15:49,I love my virtual therapy sessions and have no desire to meet in person. The convenience is wonderful and the “separation” is very comforting. Together we are doing work that is tremendously helpful to me. I found my wonderful therapist during the worst of the pandemic. Thanks to technology I was able to find the best fit for me without worrying about proximity. It has been a positive experience all the way around.
2021-05-22 15:51,"I work at a low-fee psychotherapy clinic and have been thrilled that I could continue working with patients who had to move away from our urban area due to economic stressors. The continuity of care has been essential during this period of financial insecurity, the global pandemic, social unrest, and more than usual unpredictability and upheaval. Will I continue working online? Absolutely, for those who want to. Will I go back in person? Absolutely, for those who want to."
2021-05-22 15:53,"As a psychologist who has done both in-person and teletherapy sessions over the last 14 months, it’s disappointing to see another NYT piece on teletherapy with this view that it is and should be the future of care. Why does this narrative continue to be pushed that technology and convenience is always better? While I agree that there are some benefits with teletherapy, such as improved access particularly for clients who struggle with coming in-person, in my experience that is pretty much where the benefits stop. Many of my clients lack the privacy at home necessary for therapy, with spouses or others wandering into the session. Broadband issues can make my interpretation of subtle emotional shifts difficult if not impossible at times. And a major component of successful therapy which is supported by decades of research is the development of trust between two people. In my experience, this is very difficult to replicate through a video screen. 

Lastly, on a philosophical level, why do we want to live in a world with more and more screens? Their ubiquity is already in every facet of our lives. We are losing our ability to regulate our emotions in interpersonal settings, and to talk to and understand each other. As more and more people have now been vaccinated, travel is up, restaurant dining is up, and sports and concert venues are filling up. The future is in our communities and in our ability to be present with each other in the real world, and not on screens."
2021-05-22 15:53,"My therapist moved to Canada right before the pandemic and I have continued treatment through bi-weekly calls with him. I have made more progress over the past year than prior times. Mainly due to all of the down time the pandemic has provided, but even through the telephone, he has been immensely helpful. 

I am moving at the end of the year and plan to continue my therapy via phone with him. No video element. It makes me happy that I am able to keep such an excellent provider despite where I go."
2021-05-22 16:02,"The only thing this article overlooks is the fact that some major health insurance providers initially balked at paying for online sessions; now, at least in our area, insurers are warning therapists that online sessions may no longer be covered."
2021-05-22 16:26,"Prior to the pandemic as a therapist  I was very skeptical about telemental health.  Couldn’t image zeroing in without the body language etc.    Now I am huge fan.  No one has mentioned that from the therapist perspective, I can listen far better when I can get up and walk if my back hurts, find the time to eat if hungry and have more time to walk or do daily exercise for myself.  Sitting in a cramped office all day can distract.  While others have been critical, I think the patient who can fold her laundry and minus a commute, can actually better focus too.  Freeing up time from busy lives is also good for one’s mental health!"
2021-05-22 16:31,"Having been forced out of my office last March occasioned my learning a bit about teletherapy. Most importantly is the fact that there is an intensity to in-person therapeutic work that is not possible in teletherapy. This is attributable to the lost physical, sensory, “felt” aspects of what happens in a real therapy session. Well-trained and experienced therapists recognize these nonverbal aspects as the core material of any therapy session, and use them for the deeper understandings that make psychotherapy so uniquely valuable.

A number of commenters from both sides of the therapy equation have suggested that, in various ways, this lowering of intensity is facilitative for therapeutic work. With few exceptions around practacality (eg, otherwise unsolvable one-off scheduling conflicts, or continuity of care for the relocated client), I disagree. This lack of intensity means that client and therapist alike can ""coast"" through a treatment, padded from many of the inevitable discomforts that occur for either throughout the course of a treatment, but also deprived of opportunities to leverage the deeper healing processes underway that these moments signify. The absence of these uncomfortable aspects of psychotherapy blunts the emotional potential of the work and thus the ultimate effectiveness of the treatment.

My wish is that clients and (especially) therapists alike consider carefully what they may like about the relaxations afforded them in teletherapy."
2021-05-22 17:16,"As both a client and a therapist I can say that a screen or phone is much better than no therapy, and meeting in person is preferable to meeting on a screen. Unless the therapy is top-down, cerebrally oriented, as in some CBT work, the ""field"" is somewhat artificial with screens; it's not even quite real time, with a slight lag that I believe is sensed by a clinician seeking to be a well attuned therapist. It's not that it can't be done, but it begs the question: why would I watch a film about camping, or have a friend Skype or Zoom me into his/her campsite if I can now again go camping myself? It's just not the full experience. 
 Having said that, I am grateful the technology has been available. The past year has been tough, one in which being seen and/or listened to has been crucial for some. But for therapy that involves the whole, including the Somatic experience and fine attunement with consistent deep contact between clinician and client, the screen comes up short.
So I say score one for technology! It has helped us bridge the divide for a year. Now let's get back to being human with each other, meeting together in our community (of two) in these animal skins that carry deep ancient wisdom, which requires no screens and benefits from co-regulation in the same space, in real time, with other Humans."
2021-05-22 10:52,"""If therapists catered to some (or even all) of their patients online, reducing their overhead, they might be able to broaden the community they served, offering treatment to the less privileged, for fees on a sliding scale.""

Meaning the less privileged with access to broadband? How about the homeless people in Philadelphia who get to lie on a real couch once in a while? Or the massive community-based therapy centers where therapy is usually free, forget the sliding scale? 

Wake up a smell the coffee, Ginia."
2021-05-22 14:27,"Here's one from the naysayer crowd. Maybe....the pandemic and its various constraints made many more people a little more self-reliant, and in fact, strengthened their mental capacities to deal with life stressors and the new normals? (its plural, because there is no one normal) 

Maybe being ""cut-off"" - which none of us really were, absolutely cut-off - tweaked a great many more people to realize that they do hold their ""happiness"", or at least their general moods, in their own hands. ???

Why are we so obsessed with demanding that ""so many people are suffering"", instead of seeking to find out if the very claim is actually true, in large enough numbers to really matter? (disclaimer; if you are suffering, I honor that and you should seek and get help)

Same how I feel about this ""lost year"" claim about children/students. Maybe...more kids thrived than did not. Or are absolutely neutral in response (not ignoring those who went undernourished due to the lack of school meals) Its the adults going all Henny Penny, creating angst where maybe there truly is very little. ?? 

Too many ""professionals"" and social commentators are demanding these disaster narratives to be true...all without actual proof. At least not in significant, verified numbers. 

Of course the ""professionals"" are gonna say people need their help. Their economic lives demand it! 

Humans are tremendously resilient, and bounce-backable. 

Maybe the onlydisaster was just the pandemic and the lousy initial response?"

A youth emailed me and read aloud the suicide note they were going to send to their parents. We wave warm hello's to each other on the computer screen, and ask ""Can you hear me now?"" and really mean it.  And deeper yet, ""Am I understanding you? Is this what you are saying and meaning?"" And even ""are you crying now? Can you show me where you cut yourself?"" Relationship is its own kind of healing medicine. Caring is energy transmitted though the creative art of presence, connection, and empathy. It can happen during a zoom session and can happen in an office. To answer ""who, when, where and why"" is to embrace the particulars: the specialty of care offered for and with each individual and their unique needs."

The convenience and elimination of travel hassle-factors is liberating. Interacting with people-in-their-situations elements is another bonus.  Of 25 clients I currently see, only 3 would like to resume meeting in person.  The rest, and this even includes folks who are very near my offices, want to stay virtual and maybe pop in for a face-to-face occasionally.  This means I can operate solely from my home office and close my downtown office.  This will equate getting a big raise since that rent money will be staying in my pocket."
2021-05-22 12:15,"The article focuses on scenarios where people already in therapy shifted from in-person to online sessions. Perhaps part 2 could focus on the emergence of an Uber-like dynamic in 'therapy on demand.'

It turns patients into customers who are promised: You can message your therapist at any time in any format (e.g. texting) and hear back within 24 hours; If you are not satisfied with your choice of therapist, you can switch (first time, for free), presumably without the usual angst.

Your sentence on folding clothing appears to be a myopic and reductive. You indicated that if a client folds clothes during a session, they cannot fully focus on themselves.

Instead I signed up for sobermomsquad, which offers several zoom meetings a day.  I am amazed how effective it has been. Women from all over the country zoom in and share their stories and struggles. We listen and support. The moderator offers readings and guidance. I am usually doing household chores while I listen: laundry,dishes,cooking. This calms me down and makes my attendance at these meetings much more frequent and consistent. I’m usually able to fit in one meeting a day which has made sobriety possible.  Tomorrow I will have 30 days alcohol free.  This zoom group meeting has been pretty revolutionary for me."

I don't like it but I was very grateful that I could continue working.  Now that I'm mostly back to in-person, I realize how much missed the connection that a computer screen cannot convey."
2021-05-23 13:57,"To be sure.  Great piece.  I work as a clinical psychologist and since the pandemic (and now, until offices open) provide most services virtually.  Two advantages: Being in someone's home as a guest shows me how that person lives--what brings them comfort and what doesn't.  Then, too, the Slipper Phenomenon: not having to get into a car or subway or bus, the person I'm talking to is at times sitting in the kitchen, having a coffee or...a cigarette!  These two things, being a guest in someone's home, and that person perhaps enjoying being at home (more than in an office) suggest that this type of work may continue."

Regarding my private practice (in upstate NY), my patients want to see me in the office, and I want to see them.  I have been seeing patients in the office for many months now.  A few prefer telemedicine but the majority are coming in.  To be in the office is a therapeutic experience."

2021-05-23 16:37,"I started therapy in March 2020, when everything had just closed up. I have never had an in person with the psychologist or the psychiatrist, and honestly, I’m not sure I ever will.  So far, that possibility hasn’t been discussed. For me, especially with the psychiatrist, who generally meets me for 15-20 minutes, at most, it’s probably better as it would be a waste of time.  He only treats me with meds.  He’s always very late and increases my anxiety.  There’s no need to travel to see him for that. 
 The therapist might, might, be better in person, but with her, we’ve really been productive, she really helps me, and it’s all doxy.me. Online. We’re both promptly on time, and it’s a pleasure.  And I actually feel it’s more successful than the drugs, which I truly hate and want more of her and less of him.   Either way, it’s never been  once in person, even though that could have happened with masks and distancing in an office.   No discussion of it by anyone.   
Good article. The future has arrived."
2021-05-23 18:57,"For many people, virtual therapy strips the therapeutic situation of privacy. How am I supposed to divulge my deepest and most shameful thoughts or most troubling emotions when roommates or partners or neighbors can hear me?"
2021-05-23 19:51,"I am a  Canadian Psychoanalyst who practices for several decades. Although I treated virtually the occasional patient who temporarily or permanently absented themselves, I did not believe virtual psychotherapy and psychoanalysis was possible. I have now changed my mind. It is not only possible, but it can be beneficial. However, virtual treatment is different than in person, and I would be hard-pressed to explain the differences. Nevertheless, I believe a hybrid model is here to stay for the benefit of all. The only exception is my colleagues who treat children and adolescents; they are finding it difficult."
2021-05-23 20:26,"Two weeks after NYC locked down I received a new referral. I told the colleague referring that I'd assumed I wouldn't see new patients until after the pandemic lifted. He wished me good luck with that. 

He was right. Since then I've begun more than a dozen new cases, including  individual adults children, couples and families. I'm amazed and heartened by how robust  and productive psychotherapy relationships are, even over screens. Only one of those cases has since terminated, after several months and for reasons not related to how we met.

Almost all of my patients have said they prefer to continue remotely unless they return to workplaces without privacy. The ease of access has increased the availability and doability of psychotherapy, a huge plus.

In some ways therapy on screen can be even more intimate and creative. Very early on I realized that we typically sit much closer on screen than in person. I and my patients can watch emotions flicker on faces more closely. Children are adept at using the screen in ways that expand therapy and allow me to experience their play directly. And many people are less guarded sooner on screen than in person. 

I've recently renewed my office lease and I will always maintain office space to meet people in person for whatever reason that serves their needs. I'm immensely grateful for the unsought opportunity that remote practice provides. A silver lining in a very dark cloud."
2021-05-23 20:34,"Moving on from the issue of whether it's good to fold laundry while talking to a therapist, take a look at this line from a therapist:  ""if they’re picking up their child at school, if they are in the car, we are there."" Do you really want to be driving down the street with someone who is deeply caught up in processing the trauma, or even irritation at their life?  What if they get to the school early, and want to keep talking with the kids in the car?
Also, if seeing a client's surroundings is helpful, that doesn't mean it has to be every session.  Indeed, having the therapist zoom in really puts the client at a disadvantage, meaning that  their life either has to be made ""presentable"" or gets judged in a way they can't control.  
Finally, the therapist who describes clients finally getting on topic right at the end of the session is describing the well-known phenomenon of a ""doorknob moment"" which has little to do with the process of physically getting to the session.
Tech can do many wonderful things, but I wouldn't argue for teletherapy as one of them, and I'm tired of seeing people do the insurers' business of promoting it."

I recently made an interview-based documentary (Psychoanalysts on the Couch: Notes from a Pandemic) in which I discussed the relative benefits of online therapy during the pandemic with 7 psychoanalysts. One of them, Dr. Antonino Ferro, talked about the screen between the patient and analyst as something that helped him invite more ""play"" into his sessions. Here is a quote from Dr. Ferro that explains what he means by playing and dreaming with patients (Imagine this in a very heavy Italian accent!) ""There is extraordinary tragedy of Pirandello's, which is the ""Giants of the Mountains,"" in which there are the people in the scene of the theater, and when these people go to the beds for sleeping, from the heads of the these people go out some puppets. And these puppets begin to play together,  to dream together,  to narrate each other different things. And the when people wake up, at this point immediately the puppets go back inside the head. And this permits a sort of strange, but playful atmosphere. And I think that also the analysis... in the analysis there is the question of  the pain -- in this moment is a tragic situation. But in some way I think that this ability for playing together, playing and dreaming together is an important opportunity to import into the future of my practice."""

It also allows me to see a specialized therapist that lives across the state instead of being geographically restricted.  It's much easier for me to open up while sitting on my couch in my own home than in a more sterile office setting. Plus as an aspie I do better with eye contact on-screen than in person and for my therapist explaining more in words rather than relying on non-verbal cues, making sessions less fatiguing for me. Plus, a big struggle for me is maintaining my house due to OCD, and that is something we can actually work on during a session rather than her assigning it as homework that I struggle to do on my own.

I realize that telehealth isn't for everyone for lots of various reasons but it has worked wonders for me."

It’s also clear that teletherapy is welcomed by and good for the therapists (extra source of income/maintaining income) but not great for most clients. When you fold laundry while in therapy, it’s a sign that you need to get back to in-person session once your therapist’s office opens. It’s not a benefit of Zoom therapy if you deeply think about it. Thank you for this piece - I’ve learned something."
2021-05-27 1:06,"Psychologist here working in public health - my no show rates are way down, and most, but not all, of my clients prefer it.

I will say that it's not great for kids - I really prefer seeing kids in person. 

The real issue though is insurance - if they won't pay for it, it will die. And there is already talk of restricting it, which is a shame because it really helps people keep appointments. If you don't have the time to travel two hours for a 45 minute session, if you don't have money for transit, if you don't have a babysitter, if you have health issues and it's hard to get around, - there are a million reasons why it's needed for a lot of people. It increases access. It's not about saving therapists money - it's about helping people get the care they need."
2021-05-27 1:47,"""We go with the patient; if they’re picking up their child at school, if they are in the car, we are there."" Wait, what?! Conducting treatment while someone is driving. With their kids. I can't imagine a more ill-advised time or place."
2021-05-27 2:27,"I had a couple phone calls with my therapist at the beginning of the pandemic. I've done video therapy before (which I hate, being on video, I mean, of *any* sort).

It was not the same. I miss her shade dappled office filled with toys and figurines. I miss seeing her in person. 

TBH I don't really need therapy. Even things which freak me out pass in  a few days. With my divorce winding down, there are few things to really upset me. 

But I still miss the personal contact. During the pandemic that was more important than anything."
2021-05-27 2:55,"I’m a therapist and just want to say the line at the end about group and couples therapy being more effective in person is not true. I’ve run groups and many couple sessions using teletherapy and it’s just as effective as in person, why wouldn’t it be?"
2021-05-27 12:16,"As a trauma therapist, I can attest to the positive impact telehealth has had for so many of my clients, and that it is entirely possible for a person to experience radical change and healing, even over a screen. What interests and concerns me about this discussion is what the states and insurance companies will do going forward.  Will they restrict telehealth once again based on arbitrary administrative decisions?  Will there be meaningful interstate licensing reciprocity?  Telehealth has been very good for the consumer, increasing access and choice, and I see no reason why that should stop."
2021-05-27 21:41,"Can you please do a story about the opposite problem? So many therapists seem to have gotten comfortable with teletherapy that it is now nearly impossible to find one who is meeting with people face to face.  I have called close to fifty different therapists looking for someone to work with my ten-year-old who has OCD--and for whom teletherapy does not work. Some centers told me they will only work in person with vaccinated patients!  I understand the need for therapists to stay safe, but presumably many of them can get vaccinated. Don't they have some responsibility to those who for whatever reason cannot get vaccinated?"
2021-05-28 1:40,"I’ve noticed a lot of comments about money here, suggesting that therapists are in it for the money. I have to disagree. As a therapist I can say that you can’t buy care. I have to receive a fee because otherwise I can’t do this work, but the kinds of efforts that I make as a human being in my work can’t be paid for by a fee. There are a lot of other ways to make money, I don’t think most therapist go into it for that reason."
2021-05-28 2:07,"The fact that therapists charge for their services is much more a function of the way our society is structured than of the profit motive. I chose to be a therapist in midlife, leaving a much more lucrative field; but in our society I have to provide for my own food, shelter, and health care. So no matter how much I want to benefit others, I must first attend to those necessities. Even then, I often work out a ""nice price."" There is also the reality that people value something they pay for more than they value something they get for free; so they may be more committed to their own inner work in sessions they pay for."
2021-05-28 7:17,"I'm a parent with kids who were home all year with me instead of in school. I would have never seen my therapist this year because it would have never had child care since the kids were home and I was responsible for them.  I needed her very badly this past year.  If we hadn't been able to meet over zoom, my mental health would have suffered even worse than it already did.  Having therapy versus not having therapy is what zoom allowed.  All the rest is just icing."
2021-05-28 5:15,"At some point and at some time, I hope that the issue of toxic and fully abusive clinical psychologists and especially psychiatrists be addressed in full and total detail.  I could tell you personal stories about psychiatrists alone that would chill you cold and leave you mute with disbelief and horror.  I myself would prefer in-patient trauma psychotherapy vs. any telehealth appointments, no matter what the amount of monies are involved.  The last time I asked my semi-retiring psychotherapist how much his fee was, he told me it was ""$275 USD"".......for 1/2 of an hour.  I was softly 'Let go"" as he closed down his over 300 patient practice as per my inability to pay this amount and Medicare makes it *totally* impossible for them as a profession to even break even, and this was one of the very rare good psychiatrists ( just for medications ).  Until this changes with universal fully funded healthcare, any meaningful and productive 'therapy' for anyone, will remain totally out of reach of any American without major $$$$ in private offshore bank assets aka the .1% and the .01% who normally do not seek nor desire any in depth examination of their lives."
2021-05-28 12:31,"What is troubling here is how much of the discussion is focused on convenience.  While a necessary part of many decisions and it ought not take center stage in serious discussion like this.  Zoom What do we say about the intimacy of the holding environment which permitted therapist and patient to enjoy the safety and closeness that allowed change?  How can one truly equate a virtual relationship with in-person.  It's not the same, have u ever looked on the screen at a dear friend and said ""I miss seeing you?""  What's is like to get to those moments on screen when no one speaks? In person those are moments filled with a score of motions but are screen they are often flat it seems to me.  What about the work of Anna Freud and the many women since then who espoused relational therapy? What about the things we notice about one another when we r together we might not otherwise?  I have seen many patients virtually over the year and probably successfully but the lack of discussion about what's been missing is troubling.  My best training was in patient before managed care seeing and experiencing everything with a team.  How can people be trained to see virtually and how can one help others see if we can't?"
2021-05-29 0:02,"﻿
I like the statement I read recently comparing virtual therapy to “sex with a condom.”  Yeah, the virtual/phone thing can work and be good enough, but, oh, at what cost?  What goes missing- what doesn’t get made-in this disembodied way of working? So much happens when together in the play-space/ environment/room with a patient. For many (most?) of us in analysis, the analyst’s presence is precious; that feeling felt by the other is an important aspect of the work. I can’t imagine my last personal analysis having been nearly as rich without having been near the lovely, organizing and holding presence of my analyst. 
That being said, I so love the convenience of working remotely. As a clinician in private practice, I gave up my office last spring and I like not paying for it. Also, as a germaphobe, I imagine I might feel concern about my safety when not socially distancing as much. Alas! Not a simple choice for many of us. Yet, if I’m candid here, I do believe that we’re not serving patients’ best interests by working via screens/phones..."
2021-05-29 1:45,"In my experience as a clinical psychologist practicing analytic psychotherapy, telepractice works really well, including with new patients (in 90% of the cases in my experience). I do miss in-person therapy (it's always easier and just nicer to see people in person), but Zoom allowed me to concentrate on my work as opposed to freaking out impassively when a patient would tell me they had taken covid exposure risks a few days before our session! I would say this helps the therapeutic alliance ;)
One thing though that is missing according to patients are the transitions to and from the office - I miss that as well.
As per the money, most of us had to keep and pay for offices. No gains here.
In the future, I hope to mostly go back to in-person work, with the added flexibility of telepractice in some cases."
2021-05-29 11:47,"As usual, most people are responding to this issue by very deliberately ignoring the elephant in the room: global warming. Limiting car/bus/plane/train activity should be the primary consideration in every discussion of every topic. That includes this one. Yes, I understand that screens use electricity, but the cost to the environment is minuscule compared to the cost of driving 30 minutes each way to see a therapist. 

For the sake of that certain something that comes from in-person therapy that really no one seems able to define, is it worth seeing all of our fellow animals die off and the planet go up in a ball of flames?

Anything that can be done virtually--therapy, employment, MD visits (where applicable), etc.--needs to be done so. This pandemic has shown us a way to slow down the climate catastrophe that is heading our way fast. Will we seize it, or squander it as quickly as possible in an attempt to get back to ""normal""? Most of the comments to this article don't give me much hope. Well, I suppose that's something else for me to talk to my therapist about--virtually--next week."
2021-05-29 12:10,Four months ago my 12 year old asked to see a therapist. With help from our EAP we found a wonderful woman who helped our child with the things that were bothering them. It was all done over the computer and could not have happened otherwise. We are grateful for her help in these most unusual of times.
2021-05-29 15:47,"Great discussion. MASKS-not required with remote therapy, but mandatory for all doctors seeing patients in the office.  A therapy office is a high risk environment for transmission-a closed setting with prolonged contact where people are talking continuously. 

Until the mask mandates can be removed, there is a real advantage for the patient and therapist when we can see each other's faces on video."
2021-05-29 17:13,"As a couples therapist I was about to purchase one of those two way cameras taxi drivers have stuck to their windshield. I wanted couples to be able to go home and watch themselves have a conversation with each one's face. 
Then came COVID.
Suddenly I was watching both faces up close while they were doing the same thing on their screens, something we couldn't do in my office. Granted I missed a ton of body language but I found it really interesting. 
My biggest joy: I could offer my skills to people from parts of the state who I would never have met otherwise, breaking through the urban-rural divide (this is frowned upon by regulatory bodies who want us to conduct therapy in places where we can easily identify resources and referrals in our area)."
2021-05-29 18:46,"As a practicing psychotherapist I have conflicting feelings about on-line therapy.  I've adapted better than I thought I would, as have my patients, and there is certainly a convenience factor for all.  On the other hand therapy was never meant to be convenient or easy, and there is no substitute for face to face contact that is free from interruptions and in which I can observe all the patient's body language. In addition, the psychological intimacy of the consulting room that is an important part of treatment cannot be replicated.  As for the issue of overhead expenses and compensation, insurance companies reimburse either a flat rate or by geographical location, not the cost of rent.  The work and responsibilities on my part are the same either way and I expect to be compensated accordingly.  Most of the therapists that I know already offer some form of sliding fees for uninsured patients who cannot afford to pay out-of -pocket."
2021-05-29 13:05,"I hate teletherapy. Every week I have to try to figure out where I can go to speak in privacy with my therapist. Not everyone has the privilege of a big house or multiroom apartment where they can sneak off for 50 minutes. Also, the only app my insurer approved for teletherapy often crashes to say nothing of the myriad other possible disruptions. Finally, the whole business feels like an invasion of my privacy. I don’t want my therapist to see my apartment. The safe space of her office is where therapy should take place and I can’t wait until we can resume those sessions."
2021-05-29 4:52,"It's not going to work for those of us more experienced therapy clients who seek deep relief with primal grief and rage issues from childhood.  I myself will have to wait till this 100 year pandemic passses or is more contained ( it will never really go fully away medically  ) as I need to be in a fully safe place where I can ""hit pillows"" with a tennis racket in serious rage or allowed to process serious grief...when  I'm doubled up in inconsolable gut wrenching tears or use EMDR.  

This is *impossible* to do over an iPhone or silly computer!  

One clinical psychologist I spoke with via email told me that *all* of the work she is doing at present orbits around surviving COVID 19 and all of it's related dynamics for couples & their children i.e. $$$$, forced confinement, personal space vs shared space and all of the rest.  Lots of people breaking up or being super-stressed to the max now ( think domestic violence ).  So we are all at a survival level at this stage of this life-altering global pandemic.  I know, as I am having dreams of people with masks now and escaping to open beautiful landscapes where I can breathe the fresh air and listen to beautiful waterfalls and sunsets.  One full day in real life like that is worth 2 hours in any therapists chair!  And yes I am fully vaccinated.  Still, this is far from over with and can change in a heartbeat.  If you doubt just look at Melbourne Australia which just went back into a full mandatory total lockdown."
2021-05-30 22:05,"I am a psychotherapist in private practice and have used teletherapy successfully for the last 15 months. My patients have worked very hard on existing issues complicated by Covid. Half of my patients I’ve never met, yet we have formed a deep professional relationship. My patients who were sober before the pandemic are still sober. Covid gave rise to increased s/s of PTSD in patients previously dx. It’s been a rollercoaster for sure but teletherapy works!
Though I can’t read body language like I used to, I’ve honed my skills by watching the most minute facial expressions. I’ve met new grandchildren, Covid rescue dogs, and enjoyed my patients sharing their spaces with me. 
I’ve grown as a therapist while navigating through Covid myself, worrying about my elderly parents, college kids, husband and friends. Helping my patients and watching with awe as they commit to their treatment plans, has given me hope along my own journey. 
As for the future? A hybrid model is the plan after polling my patients. 
Lastly, the article mentions that Covid has created a mental health crisis. Not true! There has been a mental health crisis in this country for a long, long time.
LS"
2021-06-11 4:41,"Another psychologist here.  I've slowly resumed some in-office sessions with restrictions lifting & the majority of clients being fully vaccinated.  Another proponent of having a hybrid option- I've got several clients whom I've begun working with at the start of quarantine, and who would not have sought regular in-office care for a variety of reasons (eg. chronic health issues, mobility concerns). Others have opened up more through Zoom and being in the comfort of home, being able to accommodate sessions in the middle of their workday (made easier through remote work), etc. 

However, there's a range of clinical issues that have not lent themselves well to remote therapy- trauma and PTSD work in particular.  More concerning is increased distractibility (intentional or not) occurring with the flexibility from being home. Related to the comment of clients folding laundry- I've had clients walking around smoking, taking calls while driving (immediately prompted them to re-schedule for safety issues), or others pausing numerous times to respond to notifications. 

One of the great joys of psychotherapy is sitting with pain, joy, suffering, healing, in short our deepest vulnerabilities of humanity. Simply put, you cannot connect with these feelings and emotions on a phone/computer screen like you would in the environment of a therapist office. I hope our profession does not completely sacrifice convenience (from Zoom) for the deep, serious work that therapy involves."
2021-05-16 23:46,I would love to see the demographics of the subset of commenters who brag that since this started they never have and still never will go anywhere except the rare medical appointment because they have or can get everything they need at home.
2021-05-16 23:47,"Thank you, Charles Blow, for bringing the history and the studies about these two unevenly treated diseases to our attention. Putting this country together, if it can be done, will be because you and others write, newspapers publish, and voters read articles such as this one."
2021-05-16 23:49,"""Still, even after the virus is brought under control it is still likely to have lingering effects. This is the long tail of Covid-19"".

A certain political party in America has scorned not only the existence of the coronavirus but also the urgency to be vaccinated, thus making light of a killer plague that has killed a half million Americans in just over a year. 

The former guy had the virus but downplayed it's lethal threat and his followers have latched onto whatever he says as gospel. He and his supporters could stymy the country's bid for herd immunity. To their twisted way of thinking, guns are necessary and non-threatening but the coronavirus is ""a mere cold, folks"".

Americans could get back to a normal way of life if only 47% of the country would cooperate and get vaccinated and take this disease seriously for the greater good for all her citizens."
2021-05-16 23:58,"No matter the time or the disease, the rich get treatment and the poor get Charity. Nothing wrong with charity. But that’s like waiting at the end of your driveway for food to fall off the supermarket delivery truck. It’s all about timing and luck.

2021-05-17 0:35,"One thing has indeed changed in 30 or so years, Mr. Blow.  We have a president who has made it his personal commitment to reach out to all underserved communities in this great nation, not just in matters such as economic and social issues, but also in regards to health disparities as well.

Already, less than four months in, his actions showcase his seriousness.  Tens of millions of Americans across all spectrums have been fully vaccinated.  And Mr. Biden will make sure that any remaining barriers such as available vaccination sites, signups, scheduling, transportation, etc. are, in fact, fully surmounted. 

President Biden will not let this pandemic decimate our most vulnerable citizens.  His ""vaccine town hall"" last week was strong evidence of his forthrightness.  He'll keep both hands on the immunization wheel, because he realizes that this is certainly one issue in which ""we're all in this together"".  None of us are safe from this virus until everyone has quite literally rolled up his or her own sleeve.

We've still got a lot to do.  Yes, the end is in sight, but we're not there yet.  Mr. Biden knows that, and he will continue his focus on expanding access to shots, abating vaccine hesitancy, and fulfilling his promise to each and every American citizen.  He won't stop until the job is done.

I'm personally optimistic that he's got our collective backs.  Who else would anyone rather have leading us right now?  The answer is no one but Mr. Joseph Robinette Biden."
2021-05-17 0:37,"Take it from someone who lives here, the NPR report on Philadelphia vaccinations isn't accurate. There are, and have been, plenty of places for people (of all colors) to get vaccinated; and the city has bent over backwards to help the less fortunate get inoculated. For example, in recent weeks, an easily-reachable site in Center City (where I received both of my shots) has operated at 20% capacity, if that. It will shut down soon because people of color are simply not showing up. And that's on them. Some people either don't think they can be infected (based anecdotally on many conversations I've overheard on Market Street); focus on history, when many years ago people were treated very poorly by the healthcare system; or simply don't motivate themselves to get jabbed. It's tragic. It was avoidable. And I don't expect it to change, which will impact all us in Philly."
2021-05-17 0:44,"The CDC, while technically scientifically correct regarding its new mask policy has, in fact, served to provide cover to the anti-maskers/anti-vaxxers.  

We have no systematic way of determining who is vaccinated and who is not.  Anyone with a decent printer and a little talent can fake a vaccine card, and who’s going to enforce this policy, anyway?The intentional holdouts will now simply parade about without masks, without getting vaccinated, and if you ask if they’ve been vaccinated, they will lie.

This policy endangers everyone who has as of yet been unable to get vaccinated, primary from underserved populations and, significantly, every single child in the country.

The CDC made a horrendously irresponsible call.  This decision reeks of incompetence."
2021-05-17 1:11,"The protocol driven world of medical field, public health and law enforcement have demonstrated their frailties by failing to keep pace with reality.  After all, they’re human and their arrogant  “expert” status failed to carry the day against common sense, reason and responsibility."
2021-05-17 2:54,"The US government in conjunction with medical insurers should set a date (six months hence) when un-vaccinated adults (medical able to be vaccinated), become personally financially responsible for any COVID treatment--enough carrots, get the stick.  It's obvious to anyone with even rudimentary statistical capability that many massless unvaccinated people are using the new CDC guidelines to pose as vaccinated.  We will have another peak building up in six weeks time."
2021-05-17 3:52,"I don’t know about other places, but in the five boroughs of NYC, there is no excuse anymore for anyone who is physically mobile and not home bound. All the major pharmacy chains which are located throughout the city, and in any event easy accessible by public bus or subway, take walk-in appointments. Lack of access is not the issue here."
2021-05-17 4:07,"Till we reach herd immunity, I will mask up.  As a vaccinated American, I could still be unlucky enough to get a break-through case. I don't want to take that risk.  If others want to unmask, it's their right.  But don't pester or harass me for making this choice to protect my health and well-being."
2021-05-17 4:10,"From what I can tell, people have been bending over backwards to give minority and high risk groups the opportunity to get the vaccine, sometimes by  actually making house calls. What else are they supposed to do? The vaccine should be free. For me, it was. It should be easy to get and given in multiple locations that are accessible to people without cars or the home bound, etc. it seems to be in a lot of places. At this point the main reason people aren’t vaccinated is that they don’t want to be."
2021-05-17 4:19,"Vaccinated people can forego masks in outdoors, and indoors with other vaccinated people.  Great, but even with over 500,000 deaths, Republicans and anti-Vaxxers deny COVID, the efficacy of masks, distancing, and probably hand washing  

Apparently Americans are incapable of critical thinking.  How many would have unprotected sex with a stranger?  No one, I hope.  In the case of COVID, transmitted person to person by respiratory droplet, every encounter with a stranger without the protection of distancing and a mask could lead to infection.  The vaccinated can still get infected.  That's why critical thinking, aka common sense, would caution to err on the side of safety.  In very crowded indoor venues, where strangers can be packed together, wear a mask.

It's dangerous to tell Americans, only 35% of whom are fully vaccinated that mask wearing isn't necessary in many places.  65% of the population will 'hear' masks are not needed anymore.  The numbers of people receiving the vaccine is falling.  People no longer fear COVID or if the do, they believe for some reason they won't be infected."
2021-05-17 5:03,"When the vaccines first began to hit mass clinics, it made me angry. How in the world could you schedule appointments for 260 million adult citizens and get the job done in time? You couldn't. That early period unfortunately set the tone where people were too concerned with scheduling and prioritizing rather than the battle to get the most shots in the most arms as quickly as possible. Vaccines were treated as something extraordinary that had to be carefully rolled out, like liquid gold for the few, not salvation of health for the many.

We are passed that critical stage now. It is possible to get started on shots without any appointment. In many cases, you just walk into a pharmacy, or a grocery store with a pharmacy department, and get your shot, no fuss, no hassle.

We need to continue and expand on that kind of distribution practice. Because so much working infrastructure was put in place in the early months, that capacity can now be turned toward serving communities with little or somewhat block access.

Are we smart enough and compassionate enough to get the job done? Well, it is possible compassion might play an unimportant role because protecting more people is also protects the rest of us. This is a community wide issue.

As we move closer to herd immunity, it is highly likely that variants are the real threat to our future. If we don't continue to attack the spread on a wide basis, we could all lose. There is hope that we will do the right thing, this time."
2021-05-17 5:13,"I recently spoke with friends who still live in New Jersey. They had all received their first shots of Pfizer back in February, and their second shots about a month ago. 

Here in Canada, with its supposedly better public health care system, most of us have only just received our first shots. A previous government (of the Conservative variety) managed to cleverly eliminate Canada’s publicly-owned vaccine manufacturers, and their Liberal successors did nothing to change this. So we’re now a good three months behind the U.S. in vaccinating our people. We also have some provincial governments whose handling of the pandemic has been comparable to that of the worst U.S. state governments. Influenced, perhaps, by U.S. politics, but elected by people right here in Canada. 

One of the very few good things about Covid-19 is that it has shone light on some of the tired old stereotypes held by “progressive” thinkers. One of these is the superior ability of publicly-run health care systems (as in Canada and the EU) to deliver better outcomes than the privately-run system in the U.S.  Another is that the only possible explanation for lower vaccination rates among certain minorities is systemic racism and a deliberate curtailment of their access. 

It’s time to look at these situations more honestly."
2021-05-17 5:23,The unvaccinated are most at risk now by unmasking.  The vaccination and voting  barriers are not two.
2021-05-17 5:35,"It’s perhaps inevitable that when a society is already in crisis, another deals a hammer blow. The US is a land enjoying and enduring the best and worst of times. It is a fantastical Camelot where the rich and privileged, the conspiratorial and corrupt, have been anointed as Arthurian heroes and the masses have been left to suffer as they must. During the pandemic, the wealthy have become wealthier: Jeff Bezos in short order accounted for the 30  billion he gave his ex wife during this dark time. Republicans strive diligently to choke off aid to the nouveau unemployed, forced into reluctant indolence by contagion. Others, critical frontline workers, are pushed to their limits to produce in the name of society.

Because we’re primal, competitive beings, violence is never far from our disposal. We seek excuses to apply it, policeman or criminal, and we do. It’s almost a crime not to own a gun in America, the giving of life and death afforded being synonymous with the way America has evolved, the weak, in most circumstances, losing every time. Guns give godlike power to mortals regardless of social status. Crisis provides a battlefield.

America needs to reinvent itself. Covid represents an ironic catalyst for positive change from socialised healthcare, enhanced employment laws, reinvigorated trade unions, the checking of corporate power, and the humanisation of society chastened by its biological vulnerabilities. There’s a lesson to be taught to the wisest by a singular virus."
2021-05-17 5:42,"Another related factor is education.
Lesser educated peoples tend to understand less about hygiene and science and how to protect themselves. People already skeptical of white man's education and medicine might reject help available for prevention and early treatment, detection and isolation to keep from spreading disease in already vulnerable communities.
The more we can do to model healthy behaviors and build up peoples as valued and worthy of self care, the more we equalize outcomes in this country and maximize personal oppotunities for future growth of peoples, not viruses."
2021-05-17 7:07,"The reported US mortality from COVID--on the order of 590-600,000 as of this writing--will soon approach the estimated death toll of influenza in 1918-19. (Deaths in Canada, although fewer, are  in the same relative ballpark.) This pandemic shares another characteristic with that catastrophe from a century ago: an extremely muted public response with very little communal outpouring of grief.

We don't have a world war on our hands--the shooting kind-- as our predecessors did. But we still haven't given voice to the immediate and  slow-burning grief of so many lives lost, hollowed out or burdened with lingering challenge or illness. Mr. Blow is right--we have to pay respect not only to what has happened but what continues to happen."

And on the subject of access, here in Massachusetts I had to drive 53 miles each way to the only site where I could get an appointment while there are 2 mass-vaccination sites in Boston, both in minority neighborhoods, as well as mobile and pop-up clinics, again ALL in minority majority locations.

Your observations on gun violence are also questionable. No one is brave enough to compile, or at least release, nationwide statistics, but in at least 2 major cities the increased violence is occurring almost exclusively in black and Latino neighborhoods. It isn't the pandemic driving that, it's the widespread feelings of grievance and of a justification for self-assertion that are causing an already heavily armed population of alienated young men to reach for their guns more quickly than ever."
2021-05-17 10:59,"This is as clear an example as you will find of someone trying to make something out of nothing, skimming over relevant facts, and more or less ignoring others that don't support the author's worldview that everything - everything - is racial.  But in this case, the HIV juxtaposition and the COVID vaccination rates examples fall flat because every one of us is operating with the same set of information and despite Mr. Blow's suggestion, access to protection from HIV (condoms) and the COVID vaccine is, in fact, widespread.  If a person chooses not to engage in safe sex and/or get the vaccine, they are doing so willingly with full knowledge of the risks."
2021-05-17 11:18,"I am haunted by the year plus that COVID has taken away.  The Trump press conferences we listened to in the beginning, until he started blabbing about bleach.  The photos of the truckloads of bodies and what to do with them.  Inability to get enough masks for healthcare workers?  A hospital in parks, or Navy ship?  Picture after picture, story after story of tributes to the innocence taken from us, and them dying alone without even a family member there.  Kids not being in school.  Empty towns.  Offices closed.  Restaurants with food but no people allowed.  Isolation day after day at home.  

But one memory that will stick in my mind, that of hope and gratitude - New Yorkers clamoring noise in the evening at their windows in honor of healthcare workers.  It supersedes my memories of gloom.  It makes me think people, real people, still wanted to make things better, even just a little bit, and perhaps thankfulness is/was/will be the only piece for us to take in our hearts and just nurture, forever."
2021-05-17 11:22,"By talking out of both sides of its mouth, the CDC has put the vaccinated at risk and the unvaccinated at liberty.  Access?  At least there will be too much of it.  Making or getting nearby appointments should be a lot simpler: suddenly I'm receiving multiple phone calls from my local drugstores to walk in.    I was vaccinated in April but will carry a mask in my pocket for good like a handkerchief.  Just in case.   So much less complicated.  It's now a part of my  life and probably saved it and that of others when I ignored Dr. Fauci's statement in March 2020 not to wear it."
2021-05-17 11:26,"Thank you for this column, Mr. Blow — for naming a significant challenge that the U.S. must address. It is, of course, just one more piece in an overall picture of disparate access to healthcare.  Before I moved to Canada, I had not seen the difference in baseline health that a public system makes — how many more people are able to retain their health, continue to work and learn and contribute to society. And I had not known what it might be to look at one’s neighbor without shame — without the pervasive sense that my comfort might depend on their suffering. It will be hard for the U.S. to step up in terms of healthcare, but the nation needs to realize that two very expensive decades in which we all carry the cost of people whose health has been destroyed under the current “system” will pay off long-term in better health and greater productivity and freedom for all."
2021-05-17 11:53,"It is time to stop using the excuse that the vaccine is not available. Extensive efforts have been made to reach all communities and vaccinations can easily be gotten in any neighborhood of NYC. And even if you had to take a bus a few blocks or a subway a couple of stops, how difficult is that? The only reason people remain unvaccinated at this point is by choice. White, black, brown, whatever color your skin, you can get vaccinated for free in NYC, and the issue of having computer access is no longer valid either as walk-in appointments are also available. If you want people to get vaccinated Mr. Blow, don’t offer them a feeble excuse like they don’t access — they do."
2021-05-17 11:54,When we look back on the handling of this pandemic in the United States I believe the CDC’s dropping of the mask for vaccinated people will be remembered as the biggest and perhaps most mindless mistake in pandemic management history. Those who have the selfish indecency to refuse to wear a mask and who avoid vaccination for political reasons can walk amongst us and spread the virus. It won’t take long for the U.S. to look like India where opening too soon has reversed any progress made. In our case it’s a CDC that hasn’t given a thought to business owners and restaurant owners and transportation managers who have to figure out how to handle maskless patrons who may or may not have been vaccinated and who demand service because they don’t have to wear a mask according to the CDC but have to wear one because the business owner says so. We already have difficulty with angry anti/vaxxers demanding maskless service here in New York. Maybe a vaccine management task force should include people who have to handle the results of decisions made by those who never have to manage the results of their own decisions.

2021-05-17 12:11,"Sad to say this is where Canada's public  system does a better job than its U.S. counterpart. While we started slowly on our mass-vaccination campaign, Canada has significantly ramped up delivering doses into arms.

Vaccines are now readily available and it is easy to sign up for an appointment. The only people now who won't get vaccinated are those that do not want to. Even so, the uptake rate here is high. Recent polls say that 85% of Canadians will get the Covid-19 vaccine. Canada should be able to reach 75% first dose by mid June."
2021-05-17 12:12,"There are plenty of white communities where vaccination rates are low, and where COVID is likely to continue to be a problem. The commonality is not skin color, but mistrust of government.  I’m not sure how you build or rebuild trust in our government, but I believe the animosity of our elected officials toward individuals of the other party is very unhelpful. We are all Americans, and everybody should at least acknowledge that. (As John McCain did when he was campaigning against President Obama. A losing effort, which is probably one reason McCain isn’t being emulated.)"
2021-05-17 12:37,"Thank you, Charles, for your remarkably fair evaluation and report of the effect of our efforts toward eradicating Covid19.

Of course, our urban populations are well integrated racially and so many more persons not of color are also affected by inaccessibility to vaccine sites. This problem has been addressed in Pittsburgh since Joe Biden became President and this has benefited all residents.

I am in no way complaining that we should not address problems particular to distinguished groups, just that these problems affected us all and the solution was due to our electing a President committed to inclusivity."
2021-05-17 12:43,"And lest we forget, as bad as our COVID response has been in our black and brown communities in America, our puny support for vaccination and care abroad has been far worse.

Despite COVAX, a huge pool of susceptibles stands ready to incubate new COVID varriants throughout humankind.  And, just as we learned 18 months ago, oceans and national borders are no barrier to infectious disease.

And our meddlesome approach to the human-wild interface will continue to promote emergence of even more diseases which many put HIV, Ebola and COVID-19 to shame.

The next wave will likely be an infectious tsunami."

Are all the people not wearing masks going to be honest and follow the rules? I thought the ""Honor System "" was for the Boy Scouts.  We now know how honorable many of the scout masters were. The virus kills.  The virus is an equal opportunity death machine.  There has been no attempt to focus on people who don't have the opportunity to know about how to go about getting the vaccine.  The borders between countries are porous.  Countries are  over overwhelmed with the virus will become spreaders. The virus does not read maps.  I would love to go out without a mask and have been vaccinated for months. I feel it sends the wrong message.  I worry about the maskless.  Very Scary."

However, Mr. Blow is wrong when he says that HIV/AIDs was given a lot of attention early on because it initially mostly affected gay, white, and sometimes wealthy and famous people.  Reagan was president then and completely ignored the rising AIDs epidemic because it was mostly affecting gay people, regardless of whether they were white or wealthy.  The movie ""The Band Played On"" dramatically shows how the HIV epidemic initially spread exponentially as politicians ignored it because it was just affecting gay people.  Mr. Blow is a smart guy and an excellent writer.  I just wish he wouldn't make EVERYTHING about race."

Already, I am dividing my recent life into pre- and post-2020 and being retired, I did not have nearly as difficult time dealing with the pandemic as did so many others.  As for masks, I didn't miss having colds, and I will likely mask up in winter and indoors. As an introvert, I didn't miss having people in my face or violating my personal space.  

There will be many opportunities for those who see change--bad as well as good--as an opportunity.  My wife and I have volunteered upwards of 20 times at max/vax clinics. We are working together, both of us outside and even around people, trying to do some good.  We never would have predicted this.

2021-05-17 2:38,"Mr. Blow is right.  COVID-19 is likely to have a continuing impact on the US and the world for years.
Particularly concerning is the after-effect in survivors sometimes known as “long COVID”, which produces lingering effects similar to chronic-fatigue syndrome, including long-term debilitating neurological effects.

I have no idea how many millions out there refused to wear a mask; I count them as potential carriers and I am not going to become infected by any silly ""freedoms"" person who thought the virus was all a hoax.

The careless or the irresponsible, who, for political (ideological, Trumpian reasons) never thought the pandemic was genuine, are still out there. As the weather warms, into our second Covid-19 summer, making the virus easier to spread or replicate if it finds an organism close enough to its own, people will be going to beaches and ballgames, restaurants and barbecues. Those who never tested positive--or bothered to get tested at all--run the greatest risk of coming down with an infection now that most of the holds are off.

I'm going to continue to wear a mask long after the all-clear, which may not come for a couple of years (at the earliest). I simply don't believe that this thing is under control and the right will politicize it to the nines. This pestilence will plague our '22 and '24 election cycles. I hold my breath as I await the dreaded spikes on the graphs.

We have made progress in America, fighting this deadly disease, but with the parts of the world still under its heel, and more complicated variants branching out, eager to spread across borders and oceans, we, here, are asking for trouble if we become careless and complacent."

Angry at his supporters who made life more difficult and dangerous for everybody else for being unwilling to follow any reasonable guidelines. Angry that my state messed up the vaccine distribution so that I had to travel 500 miles total to get two shots. And now angry that the CDC says ""whatever"" when the vaccination rate is not up to where it should be and nobody in their right mind would trust the MAGA crowd to do the right thing."
2021-05-17 5:19,"Mr. Blow,

It would only be a race issue if ethnicities were deliberately being denied shots. This is not the case.

You know that the CDC recommends and our Government wants everyone to get the vaccination. It is for the good of all of us.

What more can be done?

For those who fear one thing or another or because they hear the media drumbeat about experiments from a hundred years ago, I would ask how do you account for all those white folk getting shots?

Like the anti vaxxers and religious fanatics, it's ignorance and delusion not racism."

Getting a vaccine for Covid was hard for people who have several computers at home and are web savvy. It was an incredibly poor management by the CDC, the Federal and State Government's public health departments. So how are poor people, some without cars or computers going to get in line at ""drive through"" vaccine clinics, a uniquely American and lazy model. How will they get an appointment of they don't have web access?

Once Mother Nature unleashes a new disease on humanity, it seems it never completely subsides.

Meanwhile, disadvantaged countries like Viet Nam have worked heroically to prevent the spread of the virus, at a great economic cost, and without the rich nations' access to vaccines. In countries with fascist demagogues such as the USA, India, Brasil, with much stronger economies and access to vaccines, media propanda has duped the citizens into dying for spoon-fed ideals that demand worship of the rich through trickle-down beliefs.  Trump and his trumpeters claimed again and again that Covid-19 was a hoax, was fake news, was a cooked-up plot to make trump look bad-- but they were the very first people to get vaccinated in the USA.  The FOX propaganda that oppressors always know best, and will eventually provide jobs, knowledge, and social health, is in the same line of manipulation as that which the republicans in the USA have sold to their cult members.  It ought to be criminal.  Maybe it is."

For now.

Of course we, the privileged, have not appreciated the depth and scope of the national trauma on the “underprivileged” (disenfranchised?) folks. They don’t have much of a voice or representation. Anywhere.

We, the privileged, faced a collective existential threat. First rule of existing is assuring survival. Anything else comes afterward.

So now, belatedly, the focus turns to the folks who have difficulty accessing vaccines. And mobilizing resources to correct the situation.

Two things are encouraging re: it being advantageous to maximize the number of folks vaccinated. First, the Biden admin has verbalized intentions and has expressed comprehension of vaccinations not being equally accessible. They are switching to a “meet them where they are” approach. They genuinely appear to be trying.

Second, the Biden admin gets it. They are listening to the scientists. They understand that any nidus of COVID infection is a threat to everyone (spread, variants, asymptomatic carriers, etc). 

Thus, from public health, financial, indeed security perspectives, it is in the Biden admin’s and all of our best interests to get everyone willing vaccinated. As quickly as possible.

The pressure is in the correct direction."
2021-05-17 0:50,"Where are vaccines not available? New York City and Westchester County have vaccine sites in every town and neighborhood,  including those where the majority of residents are POC.  Our son wanted to find a site, entered his Zip Code into his phone, and was given an appointment for that same day. There are walk-in sites all over the state.

In other areas of the country, vaccines are going unused. Most of those refusing to be vaccinated in those areas - parts of the South and red state West are white, not POC. 

I don’t know why vaccination rates are lower among POC, but the fact remains that the vaccines are out there for anyone who wants them, and available immediately, same day.  Something is not adding up.  

The comparison to H.I.V. Is useful, but problematic. H.I.V continued to spread among I.V drug users and individuals who did not practice safe sex, long after the gay community learned how to avoid infections. For many reasons, including socio-economic hardship and continuing racial prejudice, I.V drug addiction has continued to plague the African-American community, while opioids, methamphetamines and cocaine, which do not cause H.I.V., have run rampant among working-class whites.  

Moreover -read Larry Kramer, “The Normal Heart” - it took years before the government, including in “big liberal cities,” paid attention to AIDS. Hence ACTUP, and Larry Kramer’s famous feud with Anthony Fauci - the two men eventually became close friends."

Although any member of the lowest 20 - 30 percent of our population economically can be adversely affected, Black people are more likely to. 

Just one example: disproportionate Black infant mortality rate at all income levels, which has been extensively studied. Even when taking every other factor into account, it's higher for Black babies and mothers. 

As Eleanor Roosevelt memorably said, the entire population is only as healthy as its least healthy member.

2021-05-17 1:59,"Real talk will help with this. Everybody talks around it, even on SNL. No one comes out and says it: there is a fraught relationship with science that poor people have. I remember when I was growing up lower-middle class, I was intimidated by science. It seemed the province of the rich to me. And it is kind of true that you have to have enough of an economic foundation (in the Enlightenment, you'd get sponsored by princes and such) to explore science. You have to have a sense of security and intellectual self esteem already. When I was in high school, I didn't take my school's new AP Biology class. Part of it was that I wanted to take a break and focus on other things; but most of it was I was intimidated. I didn't want to expose my flaws at the time. It is a hard subject and I was already good at math and English, so I figured why try? So being honest about class and racial relationships with science is probably a good way to communicate. That way everybody can breathe out and be on the same page. I think it would help to hear from rappers, from Obama, from Neil deGrasse Tyson, from Levar Burton, from actors and actresses. For the conspiracy theorists, maybe bring up some Black scientists, doctors and researchers who can tell people that Bill Gates is not even a scientist. If you can visualize yourself getting the vaccine, you can get one. And nothing makes us feel more comfortable when afraid than being encouraged by those we trust. It helps to fight fear with friendliness."

The pharmacist said I must register online, to which I answered that I wasn't capable of navigating such a complicated process (I lied). After some hesitancy, he relinquished his demand and made an appointment for me two days hence. I got the second shot a month later. The lesson is that you have to demand respect in this world, and that goes with everything, vaccinations included.
    The working people I have encountered at my small café often responded with a shrug when questioned about vaccinations, or said stupid things like not trusting them. I told them they were putting others at risk, both black and white people.
    Medical and health information is widely disseminated in this country, including information about hepatitis C and AIDS, more so in minority communities, mostly because of behavior factors. 
    The epidemiology of the AIDS epidemic was complicated,  indeed, and admittedly a squeamish one. In this country it started with hemophiliacs, spread to intravenous drug users, and exploded by way of a money transactions between that group and gay white men, one of whom was a promiscuous airline attendant. Public Healthcare workers wasted no time in alerting the public on the particulars and how to avoid contracting AIDS, which involved changing behavior."

There is no doubt that non-white, non-poor access to vaccination is complicated by all the things that affect non-white and poor people's lives. Generally speaking, economically viable white people are indifferent to the suffering of non-white people, and poor people of all colors. In non-pandemic eras, that was just fine for white folk. But now we have a virulent deadly disease running amok among us. All pools of living bodies within which this thing can evolve to better infect us will hurt everyone eventually when this creature evolves around our vaccines. Sure, we will make vaccine upgrades, like we do for the flu, but the large pools of bodies within which the thing can evolve will still be there with vaccination out of their reach. Is this our moment to stop our indifference and become a whole race, instead of a race fragmented into a group who believe only they matter and the rest of us who don't?"

We're all still battling the Covid masking or not-masking war, started by #45, who promised America the virus would be gone by Easter 2020.  It has now claimed 600,000 lives and infected untold millions more. Human beings are people of choice. We have the option of continuing to wear the mask, or not wearing it.  The option of being vaccinated or not vaccinated.  We have no idea of what a new normal will look like in a post-viral America. And so it goes."
2021-05-17 4:13,"I watched the interview with CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Wolensky on CNN this morning in an interview with Dana Bash. 

Her comments were clear. If you are vaccinated, you don’t need to wear the mask, either indoor or outdoor. Nor do you need to engage in social distancing. You are protected from the virus. The vaccines work.

She said the CDC came to this conclusion based on studies just recently published in the medical journals. 

She then went on to say that this is a public health recommendation. Of course, specific individuals, who might be immune-compromised or have other issues should consult with their personal physician. 

If you are personally at risk and your physician recommends a mask, then of course you should continue to wear them. 

When questioned about people who might “lie” about being vaccinated, she just repeated that vaccines work. Meaning the unvaccinated are just hurting, themselves. Because the people who are fully vaccinated are fully protected."

Once Mother Nature unleashes a new disease on humanity, it seems it never completely subsides.

I would expect that the present administration, CDC and health organizations would focus on at risk people and groups for quite awhile, or at least until the virus becomes innocuous.

""When H.I.V. was believed to largely affect gay white men, many of them in big liberal cities and some of them famous, there was quite a bit of energy and media attention centered on finding a cure or treatment.""

That's probably the most ridiculous thing you've written in two years. And that's really saying something."
2021-05-17 13:30,"“that Covid-19 survivors — including those not sick enough to be hospitalized — have an increased risk of death in the six months following diagnosis with the virus.”

Mr. Blow, like all journalists, love to cite studies that prove what they are trying to prove. This one is a classic. What is the increased risk, 2%? 5%? What is the number of Americans who have died under these circumstances? What is their profile? Obese? Diabetic? Heavy smokers?

When any journalist cites a study with a vague pronouncement, immediately challenge it in your mind."
2021-05-17 0:03,"Two facts that we shouldn't forget.

One - poor Black and brown communities have suffered disproportionately during this pandemic, and as Mr. Blow writes, they will continue to suffer, as this disease has become chronic for many of us.

And two - the vast majority of those who refused to wear masks and take other sensible precautions during the height of the pandemic were Trump voters, and by large numbers, white.

Once again, Trump voters used their faux claims of their ""rights"" as a blunt force instrument to hurt others. And make no mistake - they knew exactly who they were hurting. 

Think this assessment is too harsh? Then consider this hypothetical. If, for some reason, the pandemic affected only whites, we would have seen very careful behavior, mask wearing, and social distancing by Trump voters throughout this awful year. And they would have lined up in droves to get the vaccine. But now we've learned that most Trump voters are refusing to get the vaccine.

Make no mistake - with the brunt of the pandemic borne by Black and brown Americans, Trump voters chose to act recklessly, with the full knowledge that they were hurting others. 

None of this is a coincidence. None of it."

With COVID the problems have been downplaying the significance of it by one president and his party, the supporters of said president and party swallowing the denial in its entirety in the face of evidence to the contrary, and the refusal of GOP governed states to act.  The other problem has been the way the vaccination ""schedules"" were rolled out to the nation.  

1.  Lots of Americans don't have reliable or any internet access.  
2.  Because of 1, lots of Americans, school age children in particular, couldn't get their schoolwork done.
3.  Each and every flaw in our wealth care system was pointed up in the response to COVID.  
4. The GOP proved that it's sole interest is having and keeping power whatever way possible and that the suffering, economic or physical, of Americans means nothing to it.
5.  Recovering from these year long crises depends upon the iffy proposition that the Dems can pass enough bills to mitigate years of discrimination against Black Americans.

Even though I spent two months in the hospital recovering from it, and one month in rehab learning how to walk again, I was one of the fortunate ones who survived.
More than 30,000 New Yorkers didn't make it.
To this day ""long-haulers"" like myself -- that's the name given to those of us who pulled through, still suffer from a myriad of health problems associated with the virus; ranging from shortness of breath, short-term memory loss and near-constant fatigue to more severe complications involving the complete loss of motor skills and the need for oxygen on a constant basis.
While the recent CDC announcement that the day has finally come when Americans who are fully vaccinated, or who have tested negative can now walk around freely without masks, I am not in a rush to join the masses in doing so.
I am not alone in this decision.
At least not here in New York, where it's not uncommon to see others who are doing the same.
Whether from an over-abundance of caution or the knowledge that we aren't completely out of the woods yet, given this Pandemic is still raging in other parts of the world with devastating effects and a host of variants, this is still a reality we must live with.
I also know I wouldn't survive a second bout.
For those reasons, I'll keep the mask.  
There's nothing wrong with that."
2021-05-17 0:57,"I would have rather the cdc waited on changing the guidance on wearing masks, at least until the younger kids have been vaccinated. To put the onus of wearing  masks upon the non vaccinated seems to me to be yet another blow to the vulnerable among us.  Heretofore kids have not gotten really sick in the number of older people, but still, we don’t  know if that will change, do we?

Face it: the vaccine hesitant are among the same crowd as those who protest the wearing of masks.  Like they are suddenly going to wear a mask now.  

What does wearing a mask inside cost us?  Barely nothing!  

It’s summer! In most of the land we can happily eat drink and be merry out of doors. 

We could have gone a couple more months wearing masks indoors.  

It feels like a vast experiment.  And needless at this point."

It's already in the UK, and almost certainly here as well.  If the unvaccinated are available to infect, this and other variants will follow, possibly making our vaccines ineffective.  Our only protection: universal vaccination and soon!"

The question about how will we know who is vaccinated and who is not at a grocery store, restaurant, schools and work places is concerning.

I hope we do not end up taking two step backwards from all the summer travel."

The long term consequences of the pandemic really are in the future, as long as the pandemic persists around the world it’s possible that a new virus could emerge to ravage mankind all over again. 

The disparities in our society and the reluctance to allow government to address them remain factors than make the most vulnerable those with the least ability to pay for what they need. For now, remedying that remains poorly addressed. In California, the political elites in the Democratic Party are a bizarre bunch when it comes to inequities. They seem to think that homeless people are who should receive all the help. California receives homeless people from across the country and from other countries, yet it seeks no help from the federal government. Yet, for decades the children in low income neighborhoods receive inadequate educations in the public schools and have for generations. This results in the high proportion of people from these communities who have been most exposed to the pandemic."

The long tail of COVID is mostly about those who caught it, whoever they are.  Next comes its role in polarization -- for half the country you can't overstate the consequences.  For the other half it's all hysteria.  And third is how it has torn us apart in our own backyards.  Masks and social distancing -- to be or not to be.

There is no rule against talking about what we can all agree upon: that the pandemic didn't just make us sick, it made us crazy. 

Take sports.  Ordinarily a great unifier.  Super Bowl Sunday get us all in front of the TV.  Everyone has a bracket for March Madness.  And for LeBron, Kobe and Magic, one name will do. 

So what do we get from sports?  A controversial Olympics. And a billion dollars paid to NBA players who missed games. 
And my personal favorite -- fan attendance at NBA games.   The Hornets allowed 12,000 fans into each game and have done better than expected. The Pistons admitted 750 and stunk up the league.  True, there are exceptions, most notably the Knicks and the Nets, who were near the low end in attendance but fared well.  But New Yorkers and Brooklynites are way louder than normal people. 

The long tail that says the most to me is the randomness and nonsensical nature of our response.  I am always looking for things we can agree upon. We're pretty stupid. Nobody can dispute that."

“As treatments were developed and became widely available — including those that prevented transmission — infection rates among white people declined dramatically. So did media coverage. But at the same time, infection rates among Black people increased and still remain at epidemic proportions, even though treatments exist.”—Mr. Blow

So what does this tell us?
A highly publicized illness, for which there is widespread media dissemination of information (and an immense mobilization of church’s and advocacy groups, even well known black media celebrities giving first hand accounts of infection) on both how to protect yourself as well as how to NOT get HIV / AIDS, was disregarded.
Continues to be.
Legions of POC continued to eschew healthy practices and make bad choices. 

Today HIV remains so pervasive-it is now endemic-that men who have sex with men cannot donate blood. 
Too dangerous to allow their blood into the blood supply. 

It is not your melanin level. 
Not your zip code. 
Not systemic....
Not implicit....

Mind control developed by Bill Gates is injected through the shot. If this was even possible- do you think the perpetrators would pick a vehicle as obvious as the COVID shot? It could be in your drinking water for all you know.... which doesn’t sound like much btw. On top of that if you are not basing your conclusions on scientific facts, then you are already having your mind controlled by some other entity, aren’t ya?

At the beginning of the AIDS epidemic there was media coverage in the sense of hysteria, but the fact that white men were being infected did not automatically result in research dollars - just ask Anthony Fauci!  Activists had to fight long and hard and loud for attention to be paid.  There is no longer that focus because there are excellent, life-saving treatments widely available to those who need them.  It's not a race issue.  And covid vaccine parity is not a race issue in terms of access.  Vaccines are widely available.  People of all races and colors who chose not to get them (other than those who for medical reasons are advised to avoid them) are simply NOT DOING THE RIGHT THING."
2021-05-17 16:45,"We have a small business and employ several Black workers. Only one, a nursing student, has expressed willingness to be vaccinated; she had been waiting until after finals in case she reacted badly. Of our employees, only three have been vaccinated, and my son made online appointments for them. My own family, white and college-educated, all pursued vaccination aggressively and got it as soon as we could get appointments. The issue in my opinion is education, because I am seeing the same reluctance among white, Hispanic, and Black employees who lack education beyond high school and who don’t have a family member who died of Covid. I keep preaching but I think have influenced only one, an older white smoker. If we made vaccination a requirement, most of them would just quit their jobs. Unless there is a major education effort to sell the importance of vaccination to these segments of the population, we will not reach herd immunity or anything like it. If the military, federal government, and public schools (when possible) would require the vaccine, it would help a lot."
2021-05-17 16:48,"An added complication is that the vaccine may be effective for only a few months. Must we endure another economic setback and another mass vaccination program every six months or so?

The NPR assessment of vaccination problems in Philadelphia, which Mr. Black references, reminds me of parallel voting problems in large urban areas. 

The Georgia GOP has mastered the art of suppressing voter participation in Atlanta by making it inconvenient to obtain the prerequisite voter ID, by providing too few polling sites, and by situating polling sites well away from parking space and public transportation. They deliberately understaff the polling sites, and equip them with too few voting machines and, often, incompatible electrical cables.

Consequently, voters in less affluent areas of Atlanta can expect to wait 3 or more hours outdoors in inclement weather to spend 2-3 minutes casting their vote on a goofy voting machine.

There is no easy solution to the vaccination problems, since the shots must be given by a qualified medical worker. There is an easy solution to the voting problems. Mail-in balloting is the most convenient, most secure and auditable, and least expensive way to vote.

Consider India's sectarian violence and Israel, where Jewish Israelis and Palestinian Israelis are engaging in street fights and vigilante violence at a level not seen since 1947 (not just the usual hot spot Jerusalem).

Beijing clearly is hiding something. If, as I and many others suspect, Chinese scientists took an existing bat virus from a natural setting and manipulated it in a lab to enhance its lethality and transmissibility (look up ""gain of function"" research), then that is extremely important for the world to know.

What did he expect?  Did he use his power and influence to repeatedly shout to the rafters, “Go get your shots!”  No, he did not. He merely stirred the pot, getting clicks instead of results. 

I said it weeks ago and it’s still true — when smart, rich, connected and hooked-up people are voluntarily standing in line to get something, you should probably want to be in that line as well. Now those rich people are vaccinated, and presumably safe and happier. 

The wealth was there. Not cash - but wealth. The vaccine is a form of wealth that most of this planet cannot currently acquire, not at any price. And yet that wealth has been free and freely available around the entire USA for weeks, even a few months. Some folks went out to get it. Some refused - because of decades old suspicions.

The loss was felt by all of us, gay or not. The approach to this disease was tragically mismanaged by the administration of another old, white, former showman republican. Much like covid was until 1/20/21. That said, for covid, there has been a successful vaccine rollout. It’s very easy for most Americans to get this.

Personal responsibility is passe these days, but if you don't get vaccinated and are of sound mind, you have only yourself to blame.  If you have a job, your employer is already doing everything it can to get you vaccinated.  If you live in a poor area, there are huge efforts to transport you to the nearest mass vaccination site.  Or you can walk, drive, or bus to your nearest pharmacy.  They all have them available, and most of them now allow walk-ups.  The vaccine is free for everyone.  Go get one.

SARS-CoV-2 may well not be done with up, and guess who once again will be at greatest risk. Until I see in detail how the CDC came to its decision, I am very wary, and masked indoors always."

The people who never believed in the virus, didn't follow any of the guidance and refuse to get vaccinated have not sacrificed any of their daily routine and comfort for the greater good. Does anyone really think they will mask up now? They're getting a free pass, and quite frankly, I resent it."

That statement would be true if it were to remove the years, nearly a decade, before there was ANY worthy attention to gay men dropping like flies. And that didn't come along until many gay men, lesbians and Dr. Fauci became so outraged at the lack of attention to the problem and acted out in ways that were no longer unavoidable by the gen pop and government. This is an important point to your argument, which I agree with, because this is the way it always is. The marginalized remain marginalized until they no longer allow themselves to be marginalized. Stand up, fight back, act up."
2021-05-17 1:09,"I heard on NPR just today a small part of Dr. Fauci's speech to the graduating class at Emory University.  He, of course, spoke of Covid and the Pandemic.  But he also incorporated in his talk as the guest speaker racial justice, or more appropriately, racial inequality, and how even more blatant it has been during this past year.  There were three groups, African-Americans, Hispanics, and Native Americans who were the most vulnerable to becoming not only infected but also dying.  This was a reflection of their particular socio-economic status.  The sad result of this fact of life is that America may be aware of this discrimination now, but it will not last.  Not only because too many Americans simply do not care and/or wear the emblems of racism, but also  political leaders, i.e., the Republican Party from Congress to state legislatures and governors, are presently doing everything in their amoral power to suppress people of color even more.  There is no rest for the wicked, indeed."

I agree with you: covid will have long-term affects on our country in a myriad of ways. I am a single white middle class female. I am fortunate to own my 3 bedroom home, a gift from my father when he died. During this long year of covid I was able to isolate well: No one needed to enter my home except my handy man and the plumber. My only companions: my beloved cat Rumi and dog Abby. I too am feeling the affects. I feel a certain heaviness and sadness. The isolation has had its own deleterious affects: loneliness, sadness, a sense of disconnection. I know I am privileged; I have had my 2 Pfizer vaccines. My wish: that we can all rise up out of this darkness together."

It includes an inability to put food on the table three times a day, ensure a stable shelter (CDC order does not protect illegal sublets) and an ever ending stream of drug overdoses because mental health which was bad to begin has only worsened. Are vaccine rates  lower? You bet. If you are hungry and homeless, prevention of the next calamity is least on your mind. Food vouchers alone could increase vaccine rates."
2021-05-17 19:16,"There is vast emotional and economic trauma from the pandemic.  We're just beginning to feel its true effects.  Those of us with friends and family in far-flung lands worry about them as well.  The Indian community is devastated.  New violence scars the Middle East.  The long term effects of Covid-19 may cause health problems for huge numbers of people all over the world.

I'm in no hurry to return to ""normal.""  There is no returning to the world as it was before.  I'd like to hope we all realize now that we are one organism.  

But unfortunately our experience here in the US, with depraved and vicious displays of indifference to human suffering, lies about the virus as a ""hoax"" and violence unleashed upon Asian-Americans, refusals to get vaccinated or wear masks, even rallies led by a certain orange person who continues to try and undermine reality itself, this has caused a rupture I think not only with the past with with our understanding of ourselves and each other.

On the other hand there has been extraordinary grace and care among groups of people.  They have been lifesavers.  I'm older and may well have died if it hadn't been for the conscientious and careful behavior of my young roommate and his friends.  I'll never forget it.  Neighbors helped each other get food.  Another young friend drove me to get my shots.  When my cats died my community found me a beautiful young homeless cat who moved into my heart with an abundance of energy and joy.

Let's all take care."

The second problem is that there has been no state or Federal push to make sure that everyone has easy access to the Vaccine
There is no reason that medical vaccine vans cannot be created to send  to every neighborhood in this country rural or not.

2021-05-17 19:34,"So it turns out that COVID-19 isn't just putting our scientists and doctors to the test--it's also testing our capacity and resolve for unified action. Given the CDC's sudden kowtowing to those with a vested interest in summer gatherings and a return to ""normal"", I'd say our  torchbearer for caution has failed. It's up to individuals to remain vigilant, as it always has been."
2021-05-17 19:56,"Aside from the general speculation that the CDC loosened restrictions in effort to pressure more people to get vaccinated before summer is over, I have to wonder if they aren't also testing out the true strength of the vaccines. How many people were actually tested in the trials before the emergency approval? And for how long with the vaccine be effective?  I feel like the general public is somewhat of a lab rat right now and CDC is not necessarily who I will look to for advice. I'm vaccinated, but will also continue to mask in public spaces no doubt until next year [who knows what kind of variants will surface this coming winter?]."
2021-05-17 21:32,"Re availability of COVID vaccines.  Vaccines.gov shows vaccine in stock at virtually every pharmacy in my area  - in poor areas as well as middle class ones, most often within a mile or two of  a given location.  Home vaccinations for the homebound and free transportation to the  mass sites (no appointment now required) are available.  

This is vastly different from the the situation in February - March, when only a few mass vaccination sites had the vaccine and it was very difficult to secure an appointment online.   

What is lacking is a major public relations campaign promoting vaccinations and explaining where they can be obtained."
2021-05-17 21:45,"No one can deny we are experiencing a momentary sigh of relief due to the extraordinary work on the parts of scores of scientists who've provided us strong vaccines promising a real level of safety for the immediate months ahead.

Now is the time for an all hands on deck effort to provide substantive outreach to vulnerable and marginalized communities. And I am convinced that when folks are provided accurate and timely information regarding the safety and effectiveness of of these vaccines, a ground swell of support and cooperation will occur."
2021-05-17 22:09,"Besides the outright 'I refuse to be vaccinated people' out there -- there are what I call 'vaccine orphans': people who would LOVE to be vaxxed, but a serious / chronic / (and this is important) invisible health issue makes it unwise &  not recommended that they receive one.

We have consulted with family internist, a top immunologist and in past, neurologist, about a family member who cannot receive vaccines of any type -- and asked, what about CoVid shot? Any workarounds? Nope, not to be, at least not in this critical moment.

So, it's not a political statement (quite the opposite). 
It's not personal preference (again, the absolute opposite). 
It's as other commenters have said, their ability to be vaxxed, or their response to same, is non-protective, so it's all about playing defense, certainly in the present and for some time to come. 

And, just reading about the horror and shattering sadness that is currently India ... their mutation is one that, due to seasons' difference across the globe ... could well be our Winter 2021 nightmare. 

So, enjoy the summer as best -- and as safely -- as one can. Vaccinate yourself if at all possible. Please. For yourself. For your family. For your community. For the world.

And keep the masks handy ... winter is coming. Again."
2021-05-17 22:32,"Charles, I hope everyone hears you. So much of the hesitancy goes back to the cross ethnic absence of a basic science education among Americans. Not throwing stones at any one identifiable group, it appears to be almost everyone! Maybe Health Class needs tweaking!
We’re still in too foggy a view for me to feel comfortable that COVID is over. With a fairly constant 40% refusers it is impossible to predict if the virus will mutate to another deadly form.

I’m going without a mask to the stores that permit it. There’s no question I will continue to follow the CDC guidances."
2021-05-17 23:44,"I'm glad you make the comparison between coronavirus (SARS-nCoV-2) and HIV. Both of these are the viruses that cause the related diseases. NEITHER of them have vaccines.

So all the COVID-19 ""vaccine"" does is reduces the severity of the disease once you get it. And I do mean ""once you get it"", because absent a vaccine for SARS-nCoV-2, everyone will get it, because as Mr Blow pointed out, it is highly infectious (R>2) vs HIV which as an Ro < 1 in the US (according to the CDC).

Lesson: We still need a real vaccine, like the Polio and Measles vaccines for those viruses, for coronavirus. And while we're at it, let's tackle HIV, Dengue Fever, Malaria, Ebola, and the host of other viruses that are plaguing humanity.

In the meantime, I'm wearing my mask for the foreseeable future when in public."

 Lets follow the CDC's rules and guidance on masking. I know its hard for the Left to let go of this because they've spent the last almost 18 months using it as their own leverage for control.
 Nobody is going to stop you from wearing a mask whatever your reasons are. The chances of getting Covid if you have been vaxed are about nil. 
 Enough with the browbeating already."

If a particular person doesn't want to be vaccinated, well, it's not my fault.  Nor my problem - I got vaccinated.  

Vaccine is available.  Get it, or don't.  But if you don't, don't try to blame it on society.  Or availability, because this is even easier to get than a flu shot.

As effective treatments were developed and the disease became “curable”, media attention did decrease, which is neither a big surprise nor particularly racist. 

But now to COVID. Access is no longer a reasonable excuse for anyone living in an urban or suburban area.  Look at The NY Times home base. Vaccines are offered, free of charge, at drug stores, city and state sites, hospitals.  Many sites now accept walk ins. Even if one is illiterate and lacks internet access, one can still get a vaccine. And given the ubiquity of cellphones, anyone can find a site or ask for help.

The vaccines are safe, far safer than Covid. While Covid has demonstrated downsides that include hospitalization, brain fog, myocarditis, destroyed lungs, kidney failure and death, the vaccine does not. In a perfect world, there'd be no risk, and lots of certainty. Our world is imperfect and vaccines are our best bet.

And the vaccine will prevent individuals from losing everything to pay for our inadequate - and evil -  medical profiteering. It will also help reduce the cost of premiums and payments all of will make in the future to cover the costs of Covid related expenses.  Nothing is free. All of us are going to see the impact."

We need a system for managing risks associated with covid as well as future pandemics caused by novel pathogens.  The more we crowd into indoor spaces, the greater the risk of transmission - that goes not just for covid, but for tuberculosis, flu, RSV, etc. We need a system of dynamic congestion or ""peak load"" pricing for indoor gatherings above a certain size,  We have the technology to do this in an equitable manner.

Why would anyone give up a well-paying job to handle 10 to 20 hours on bills?? Is it not possible to do both? I don't get it.

I've also been stuck on the consumer end with things like getting double billed by hospitals and getting fought over by workman's comp and my own health insurance.

It is a sad day when lobbying has convinced politicians to oppose changes that would improve the quality of life of their constituents.  The vested interests in the insurance and healthcare sectors seem to have brainwashed people into believing that there are no real alternatives when the reverse is plainly the case.  

When people have to decide whether they can afford to be treated for life threatening conditions I wonder whether it is time to consider changing the system.  You’re paying more than anyone else in the world for an inferior service, why not move to a superior and more affordable alternative?

Almost? 

The one thing this pandemic has highlighted is the overwhelming greed in America's health care system. It can best be summed up by saying that getting sick in the US is like falling into a den of vipers: you will certainly suffer multiple bites, and there is a very small chance that your financial status will survive intact. Health care providers and insurance companies have become rapacious predators, eager to inflate their bottom lines through any means necessary, usually including the most egregious violations of ethics and decency. And always, their response is the same: that they have “followed the regulatory requirements."" What they neglect to include is that for the past several decades, it is their lobbyists who wrote those regulations. 

Thankfully I have remained free of Coronavirus, and have been fully vaccinated since March. Since I am a retiree on Medicare, my total costs for this have been zero. That ought to give all of us pause to consider whether we want to continue to support a system that allows health care providers to bleed us dry in order to fund the exorbitant profits and CEO pay that this system demands.

The current system is insane, inhuman, and deeply distorted. We need to wipe out the vipers and restructure our health care system so that the focus is on health care, not profit."

How is the current situation any different than the push factors in Europe during the 18th and 19th centuries. The US continues to move in the direction of becoming a 3rd world backwater. What does it matter how much GDP is or how strong the military is if every day life for citizens is filled with stress and lacks basic services and comforts. It is such a joke. How long will people continue to have the same conversations over and over and over again. One of my best friends lost the generous medical coverage from her parents when she graduated from college in the early 2000s, she has had type 1 diabetes since infancy and almost died multiple times while trying to buy insulin for cash and stretch it out. In the end, she decided to do a Ph.D. program abroad rather than in the US in order to save her life. She moved to the UK and never came back. I moved abroad to work in the international humanitarian sector and do ALL of my healthcare overseas - even though my excellent insurances covers all of my expenses in the US. Even with great insurance, US healthcare is a hassle, and quite frankly, unless we're talking about a few rare diseases for which there is special expertise in the US, the healthcare is substandard!"

A stay in the hospital even as an outpatient for “day surgery” involves specialists and services that you don’t get to choose and that you had no idea would be needed.  “Sticker prices” for medical procedures are astronomical and have no relationship to what your insurance authorizes for payment and if the hospital, physician, group or services accepts these determinations as payment or not.

I always thought it was pretty stupid for people to argue that COVID treatment should be free but treatment for everything else, say, falling off a log, should be charged as usual. I figured (aside from the ridiculousness of ranking diseases as worthy of treatment or not- talk about health care rationing!) that the health industry would just find a way to get around the rules and stick it to patients anyway. And that there would be no consequences for deceptive billing, “mistakes,” or even actual fraud.

2021-05-21 12:52,"Another factor that could contribute to medical bills, that I haven't seen mentioned enough, is the changes brought about by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in 2017. Specifically, the TCJA made it easier for large businesses to switch from mandatory accrual accounting to cash basis accounting. Why is this relevant? In accrual accounting, revenue is recognized as soon as the service is provided and a bill is generated. That makes it taxable - in essence, it's like having a ""stamp tax"" on the bill itself, before the debt is collected. By taxing businesses (including hospitals) on a cash basis, there's no immediate penalty for exorbitant bills. Another reason to roll back the TCJA."

The distressing aspect of this compared to Australia, Canada Europe and Britain is that health cover is universal and free of direct charge and funded by state taxation. Any reasonable hospital and medical care is provided free of direct charge unlike the US system which involves multitudinous layers of price gouging and profiteering by the pharmacy, hospital and medical industries feathering their own nests at the expense of the community at large with a massive so-called insurance industry interposed between the consumer and medicine.

2021-05-21 13:19,"Thanks for this article; it highlights the disgraceful way in which the US health system is funded. 

Indeed, a strong argument for universal health care as others have noted.  This doesn't mean that the government has to run it, just that everyone is guaranteed access to health insurance at an affordable price, with plans that are easy to understand and rules in place to prevent the ""gotchas"" that can confront people with unexpected out of pocket costs (like the example of the air ambulance).

It's unfortunate that so many Americans believe that implementing universal health care is a ""socialist"" plot.

I hope the people in these situations can unite to make their voices loud and to call for the needed change."

2021-05-21 13:00,Outrageous. Insurance executives should be ashamed. Hospital executives should be doubly ashamed. Specialists and doctors and providers who have received all the various Covid related PPP money and other special compensation should be ashamed.  Yeah right. They are feeling the shame all the way to the bank. Covid 19 is a financial windfall to the US health care industrial complex. Shame. shame on the entire greedy lot of them.
2021-05-21 13:24,"In general, I think the US desperately needs to move to an universal health care system.  And anyone who had covid up until recently should have their medical bills paid for the government.

But in this particular case right now, I'm happy the insurers are starting to charge patients.  I think anyone who chose not to get the vaccine should have to pay all of their medical bills out of pocket.  And they can't, bankruptcy.  Maybe that will sway some of the anti-vaxxers."
2021-05-21 13:27,"The problem isn't that medical providers charge for their services, but how they charge. There is no rhyme or reason to it, and it comes after the fact. Because life itself is at stake, they can and sometimes do just charge whatever they want, in a way so resolutely confusing as to be impossible to challenge. If death is inevitable, then there are many circumstances in which I would rather pass away than have to deal with such a stressful situation serving only to bankrupt me and my family. In my own career I devote myself to taking care of people and the money I make is a secondary part of that and reasonable. People who can't bring themselves to do likewise should not be medical providers and deserve to be heavily regulated."
2021-05-21 13:27,"Before we returned to London my husband had a supplemental Medicare policy which picked up everything Medicare didn't pay for. Clearly a lot of seniors are not buying it.

This mess is going to go on forever."
2021-05-21 13:30,"It's all about the money. As others have said we need a government-run baseline of medical care and anybody should then be free to use private insurance to top up their care level, if they wish. This is exactly the system used in Britain, where nobody gets a bill - ever! The only thing that stops it being done here is the American Medical Association. This powerful doctors' lobbying group is just another labor union really; just as police ""benevolent associations"" are just labor unions too. Vested interests never give up their preferential status without a fight. It's all about the money - nothing more, nothing less."

2021-05-21 13:35,"Thanks to Canada's failure to maintain an indigenous publicly-controlled vaccine manufacturing capacity (now being remedied) and thanks to US vaccine nationalism preventing adequate supplies from reaching Canada (which will also contribute to keeping the border shut for public safety reasons), Canada's vaccination rate is below that of the US; however this is being remedied, with glitches, and in the not too distant future Canada will exhibit at least similar rates of vaccination to the US. 

However, all that said, no-one in Canada is facing the antediluvian financial and logistical crises described in this article as a result of having suffered and survived COVID-19. This is because its public health care system finances the costs of care (paid for of course by taxpayers). In this respect, Canada and a great many other countries will remain well ahead of the primitive state of US health care arrangements until something gives at the Federal level allowing for more humane solutions to the impossible financial burdens placed on those who fall ill, which at one point of life or another is everyone. 

Perhaps this is an opportune moment to rethink the whole paradigm, if only Republicans weren't so consumed with election illusions and Mr. Potatohead (or is it Potatoehead?)."
2021-05-21 13:38,"This is another aspect of the decision the Democrats made not to pass single payer health care when they had the opportunity. There is no reason this kind of complicated billing system should exist, apart from fleecing patients and paying rents to the insurance industry."
2021-05-21 13:40,"President Biden proposes a total of $6 trillion in spending - $1.9 trillion for the American Rescue Plan, $2.3 trillion for the American Jobs Plan, and another $1.8 trillion for the American Families Plan - for pandemic relief. Instead, we could use that money to implement National Healthcare. Something that would truly benefit everyone. Seriously, why are we still working within the current system? There are plenty of health care models around the world that would work for us too.

We collectively pay for defense, roads, and many other services. How, in 2021 is healthcare not a shared cost?"
2021-05-21 13:43,"Lest anyone think Medicare is so terrific, lets recall that it still has deductibles and copays, has Part A, part B with a premium of about $140.00/month, many confusing versions (""choices"") of Part C supplements or co-insurance from a private company, and then Part D prescription coverage, (multiple tiers of drugs as well as a monthly premium...deductible and co-pays.  Since there is no family plan....each spouse is separate, so you have double the paperwork and choices and it all has to be re-examined and re-enrolled each year. Together, my wife and I are paying almost as much as we had for a single ObamaCare (Affordable Care Act) family policy that had substantially better coverage.   Oh...and there is no Medicare coverage for dental care, eye care, or hearing, (hence the high bill for hearing aids mentioned in the article).  

It would be nice if we could get help for actual preventative activities, like a gym membership, physical therapy or exercise classes, or diet consulting...but we're paying on our own for those.   And it would be nice if all the body parts were covered without carving out those bits which are especially important, and vulnerable as we age (eyes, teeth, hearing). 

So,  this is Medicare, the great social gift to American seniors."
2021-05-21 13:43,"I am in the process of settling the estate of my sister, who died in March. The family of a deceased person cannot be held responsible for bills that individual incurred, healthcare or otherwise, unless they were jointly incurred (like a jointly held credit card for example). Only the estate, if there is one, is liable. Some creditors try to prey on a family's sense of responsibilty and integrity in order to persuade them to pay from their own pockets. The answer to that should be a resounding ""no."""
2021-05-21 13:45,"All medical bills should be challenged. The medical codes of the charges challenged and compared to local market rates that should apply. Is a given procedure covered under one medical cost code being split into several cost codes to increase the amount of the service? Was the procedure necessary, or did the doctor involved add ""just in case"" procedures without consent? Instead of accepting at face value what our out-of-control medical cost system throws at us, we should challenge invoices at every turn. State insurance commission offices and other non-profits focused on medical billing can provide assistance. We also need more class-action lawsuits to reign in the industry's predatory pricing practices."

2021-05-21 13:43,We desperately need a Universal Health Care system. This article illustrates this clearly!
2021-05-21 13:30,"For those who followed the rules, socially distanced, wore masks in public, got vaccinated, etc., all costs should be covered by a tax on those who did not follow the rules.  For those who walked around unmasked, declined vaccines, partied with friends, family and neighbors, and acted like science-denying baffoons, they pay for their own care out of pocket while subsidizing those who did their part.

Another option: Trillions of dollars went to businesses and it appears most of it was not distributed properly (stolen).  Identify those businesses and make them cover the cost of care for those mentioned above.

It is time for universal government sponsored healthcare!"
2021-05-21 13:49,When my mother died in 1997 from cancer my siblings and I were not responsible for her outstanding medical bills. (And they were huge e.g. a brain biopsy.) Why would other family members be responsible for medical bills of their loved ones who did not survive Covid?
2021-05-21 13:56,"In 2020, I had three hospitalizations (none, thankfully for COVID). In total, after Medicare and my carry-over retirement health insurance, I paid less than $1,000 in disallowed costs and co-pays. I'm no one special. This should be available to every American. Those keeping us from national health insurance must be voted out of office. Capitalism is intentionally cruel, transferring cash from the have-nots to the haves. Adam Smith recognized the cruelty of unmitigated capitalism, which is why he published ""The Theory of Moral Sentiments"" before ""The Wealth of Nations""."

I spent a week in a private hospital (in Mexico there are public and private hospitals) under observation and treatment to control the inflammation in my lungs. I have insurance and my bill was $300 USD.

My point is that a national health system won’t be of any use if America doesn’t control the artificially high prices in hospitals first."
2021-05-21 14:01,"For the folks that don't want to get the vaccine, avoiding the nightmare of never-ending hospital bills ought to be reason enough to get the vaccine.  The approved vaccines provide nearly 100% protection against severe COVID illness."
2021-05-21 14:02,"I worked in healthcare for over 40 years. The reality is that health plans and Medicare almost never pay for air ambulances (many other ambulance trips as well) and usually not for hearing aids. (That’s why VC-backed consolidators have jumped into the air ambulance business in recent years. For hearing aids, check if the policy will pay if hearing loss is the result of an acute medical problem or injury. It’s like with dental care due to other than dental problems. Some will, some won’t. Fight for what your policy is supposed to provide and contact the state insurance commission if your contract shows you are owed the money.) The rest is most curious. Even without the Covid waivers, most insurance policies cap covered out-of-pocket expenses at $10,000, often less. Drug costs outside of the hospital are handled differently and will have additional deductibles and co-pays. But some of the immense bills reported in the article seem fishy. Have people considered writing to their Congressperson or state representative? Political pressure flows downhill, and hospitals, especially the alleged not-for-profits, are licensed creatures of government."
2021-05-21 14:04,"The problem with medical care billing is not limited to the current pandemic.  Where else in our society do you go and have a service or purchase a good and not know the price before hand ?  Would one go to a restaurant and have a meal and then be told weeks or months later what the ""cost"" is ?  And while I mention ""cost"", let's be serious about some of the charges that healthcare providers levy, say for a simple aspirin.  Unreal.  ""We"" give many healthcare providers a blank check when we enter their territory.  What will that test cost me ?  We usually have no idea and only hope for the best.  And just try to change it by asking upfront what something might cost.  I haven't had much success."
2021-05-21 13:12,"Almost all of the problem cases referenced here are things our legislators do nothing about. Emergency room visits are all too often connected to medical practitioners in the hospital, who are not contracted with the insurance carriers, and then charge many multiples of what medicare would allow or the majority of other physicians in the same specialty accept. The air ambulance example here is almost laughable. $50,009 for a patient's air ambulance!! And then conveniently it went away when the Times inquired. Regular ambulance services are also exorbitant we read about all the time but they all can get away with it because it's an emergency. One that is a convenient and smooth path right into the emergency room. The majority of our surprise ridiculous billings in medicine happen either from emergency room visits or the very small percentage of medical providers who choose not to contract with the insurance carriers, catch the patient at a time when they are most vulnerable, and charge whatever they want."
2021-05-21 13:29,"A year ago I spent less than 24 hours in the hospital due to a copperhead bite, and the cost was over $90,000. Over half of that was for 4 packets of antivenin. I have Medicare and a supplemental policy and thus paid nothing, but the experience brought into sharp focus the plight of those who cannot pay for this kind of care.  Add drug costs to your sense of outrage.

There would be no need for this article if the United States had national health care."
2021-05-21 13:48,"You don't have to be a socialist to find this appalling. In fact, most capitalists in the rest of the world find it baffling that US capitalists (apart from those who own shares or are directly employed in private healthcare) could possibly think the US system is even good for the US economy, let alone the American people.

Despite leaving 1/10th of the population completely uninsured, the US still spends far more per capita than any other country (about 67% more than Norway and Germany and twice as much as Canada), without getting more.  A huge part of the reason is admin costs - private US healthcare requires far more bureaucracy than public health care in other countries - just imagine how much the billing cesspit described in this article must cost to administer.  Then imagine the true cost, by factoring in the degraded productivity, health and mental health of the patients and family members struggling to extricate themselves from the cesspit.  

Proponents of private health care argue that only a competitive market can ensure efficiency, yet here are the people running those paragons of efficiency brushing off the nightmare they are inflicting on patients/customers as unavoidable bureaucratic incompetence.  It would be funny, if it weren't tragic."
2021-05-21 13:51,"The present pandemic is not our mistake. The doctors worldwide accept that they have not fully understood the virus and how it mutates and behaves. That being the case, the Governments around the world should extend a motherly treatment towards its people. My point is, only the respective governments should foot all the bills. 

When the Governments around the world spend billions and billions towards military, why not they spend the same amount to save their people? Let all countries cut their military expenditure and spend the same on health of the people. Foisting medical bills on people is unacceptable. Let there be free medical treatment for this virus."
2021-05-21 13:36,"Government payment of healthcare costs based on diagnosis is preposterous.  

Democrats spent years campaigning on the need for universal healthcare coverage.  Now, once again, even as Congress is finally spending billions of dollars on worthwhile needs, universal healthcare coverage isn’t even on the table.

Stimulus payments, child tax credits, rent relief:  All of this means nothing in a country where one serious healthcare crisis — and we will all have at least one — can leave you and your family bankrupt.

I don’t know when it is going to dawn on our economy that the past-due rents, mortgages, hospital bills are also a slo-mo avalanche of reality- at least for the middle, lower classes. How long will we ‘party on’ with the narrative of accumulated savings to spend on temporarily-raised prices? 

No doubt should a bill even get written to cover these costs, Republicans will drag out the ‘radical socialism’ mantra, and Sen Manchin will call for bipartisanship. Maybe all those patients, their families should just send those bills to the Republican National Committee- rather than try to sort out which half of them were ill,  died, because of Republican insistence it was only..,,like a case of the flu.

2021-05-21 14:06,"Bottom line, in America health care delivery is in the control of the private health insurance industry. Health care sold as a product in the consumer marketplace. This has been its customary operational template and given legislative approval with the passage of the Affordable Care Act in 2010. The arrival of the pandemic entered in to amplify what were already existent deficiencies in America’s health care system. One that has come to operate less and less as a doctor/patient relationship than one determined by the regulations and restrictions of health insurers. A system where those with the financial means receive the best quality health care."

About a year ago I wrote a comment that the bills would come due concerning an article about how heroic the healthcare institutions were in combatting the virus.  Yes they were heroic.  Yes they put out a tremendous effort.  Yes everyone chipped in and risked all for the good of the sick.  But the bills would come due and now they are.  Every single procedure was tabulated, documented and billed.  Everything.  That's the way we run healthcare here in America.

The billers are just now catching up with the backlog.  People will be getting bills for months to come.  Thank you for saving my life but I don't have the $150,000 you want.

In every other modern industrial democracy health care is a public good and not subject to the whims of ""the market"".  We act like our system doesn't ration care but that is what it does through its brutal economics.

It is time to completely overhaul our health care delivery and finance system. Have common benefits across all patients but premiums as a % of income.  We need to return to the days where health care doesn't cost a person more than 5 or 15% or their incomes not the near 20% today!

However, as long at the Republican Party exists in the form it has taken in the last 20 years is just not going to happen.

The only way to address health care is an overwhelmingly Democratic House and Senate.

Note to Times:  Compare and Contrast these costs in America with those in Universal Coverage countries like England, France and Germany.   Sure it’s a lot of money but I would bet in those country the sick didn’t get financially steamrolled."

We tried to live in the states but even as a university professor the government would not let him in.  So we decided to move to France.  The first few years we had a private health care policy which did cover absolutely everything medically, including drugs.   After a few years we were able to get our ""Carte Vitale"" and an inexpensive top up policy.  Here no-one worries about health care costs as the carte vitale (the government coverage) and the top up policy (about $250.00 per month) covers all our medical costs, including taxi service three time as week for my husband who needs dialysis.  I remember in my law practice people would come in with mounds of bills that they were unable to figure out.

I can handle paying for travel disruptions myself, but if I caught covid and needed treatment or had any other problem needing urgent medical care (slim but possible chance), I knew any medical bills in the US would wipe me out and leave me in debt for the rest of my life.  

I think Americans should be clear what they agree to when resisting universal medical coverage: 1) insured do pay more because a portion of what they pay contributes to care for the uninsured, 2) lack of flexibility in the job market as many people are hesitant to give up a job with decent medical insurance & 3) acceptance that many in society cannot access a basic level of medical care."

There is NO incentive for the folks doing the billing to fix this - they don't have to pay for their mistakes. And, in fact, it might be profitable - it's sort of an interest free loan - They can book a receivable as revenue, and then eventually, reverse it, but in the mean time, their financial position shows better."

If anything is a great argument for getting the vaccine just look at the cost of the hospitalization, and long term illness.  
The vaccine is free, long term hospitalizations, not to mention long term effects of Covid in some patients can easily add up to hundreds of thousands of dollars. 

There are two terms that public ought to remember:  ""Morbidity and mortality.  Mortality means that a person gets sick and died. Morbidity means that the person gets sick and suffers a long, long time and runs up huge medical bills going from doctor to doctor to treat shortness of breath, heart disease and all kinds of other long term Covid related problems.

My Medicare Advantage policy has an OPM of $6700 per calendar year. And, I'm fortunate to have no deductible on plan. 

I imagine there might be some squirrely work around in the fine print that might bite me but I believe one touted feature of the ACA was that one would never have to spend their life savings on care. The OPM, if reasonable, would protect most from that. 
(And, I know even an OPM like I have is beyond many people, unfortunately)

Under Trump, I think many ""junk policies"" came to be, with little protection against catastrophic illness events. 
Maybe someone can illuminate. 

The solution is two-fold. 

We need a Canadian/Australian/European/ Japanese style sensible national insurance system that well serves so many people around the globe. 

But, before that, we need a leader who convinces us that it's not only better economically but also leads us to caring about each other instead of each of is being a profit ""mark"" for each other. It's brutal enough without monetizing our very lives. That's sick.

I spent most of my career caring for patients with kidney failure. Most people do not know or appreciate how unique the care of these patients in the U.S is. In 1972, a federal law became reality (PL 92-603)--it pays for the care of all End Stage Renal Disease patients in the US. It does coordinate with private insurance but pays when people have no insurance. Believe it or not, these patients can even get private insurance or Medicaid after they begin treatment. As I counseled many patients about treatment (before they started), I met patients who were refusing treatment because they couldn't afford it. I witnessed the joy and relief that these people experienced when I told them that this would not be a problem and that they could live. Public law 92-603 provided this coverage through a special program within Medicare---I am telling you that it can be done in the US."

In addition, many people with autoimmune diseases are unable to have insurance cover their medication because it's not deemed ""medically necessary.""

I'm American and would love to come back home and this is the one thing holding us back. It will be near impossible for us to find jobs that include health insurance as a benefit. We've looked into buying health insurance and it ranges between $1200 to $1700 per month. That's more than rent or a mortgage payment. Who wants to live like that?

I will never understand why so many Americans seem to believe unfettered capitalism takes precedence over the basic human right of taxes paying for health care.

About 10 years ago when NAFTA was being discussed Warren Buffet commented that the best thing the American government could do to help American businesses compete would be to bring in a public health care system.

Then the hospitals and doctors engage in balance billing and threaten to ruin your credit by sending you to collections. The insurance companies aren’t paying for the treatment but aren’t advocating for their policy holder either with the hospitals.

2021-05-21 15:42,"Once again, this article illustrates the insanity of America's for profit healthcare ""system."" Our other medical problems didn't magically go away when the COVID pandemic happened. And insurance doesn't help either. There are too many holes and too many mistakes. We've accepted a broken overly complicated system far too long. The system was a mess long before the virus. Even President Biden, the most progressive president in history, won't accept an overhaul of the system. When will enough be enough? We don't need improved ACA and we certainly don't need more choices; we need single payer."
2021-05-21 15:44,"Although it doesn’t resolve the underlying problem of ruinous profit-oriented healthcare costs, those who received care at hospitals designated as non-profit should contact the hospital about charity care and community benefits which they provide as part of their non-profit status. These benefits are not widely advertised, but they do exist. Meanwhile, keep fighting the exhausting battle to get bills down. I am an attorney, but resolving unwarranted charges and miscoding (always in favor of the provider) became a part-time job for me as my mother aged.  I prevailed, but it took months of time and energy that I was lucky to have."

2021-05-21 15:45,"There is something really wrong with this scenario - how can the bill for a service be different simply by how it is coded? After all, the treatment is no different so the actual cost to the hospital is the same, and presumably the provider is not being forced to give away services at below cost. So I assume the provider's profit is less if the treatment is for Covid. And this gets us back to the whole issue of whether America's healthcare should be a major for-profit business?"

I have a deductible and yearly maximum out of pocket, after which everything is covered. What am I missing? Is the writer saying these people did not have a max out of pocket? Or they consented to non-covered services? Or they did not consent to non-covered services and were billed anyway? A test, if it is ordered by a doctor, should generally be covered. And the air ambulance - should be covered fully after you meet your yearly total max OOP - the article made clear this was a covered expense. Doesn't every insurance have this feature?

It is disgusting that the billing works this way - or I should say it doesn't work. USA has been stuck this way for decades. No hope because the politicians can't come to any consensus and the regular people suffer."
2021-05-21 15:28,It is likely that hospitals often send bills accidentally on purpose assuming people won’t  pay attention and just send a payment.  This is usually for smaller things/amounts.  Patients are on their own to contact their insurance companies and hospitals to work this out if they have any questions.  It’s been like this for a long time.  Hospitals have missed out on a lot of money maker elective surgeries (hip and knee replacements) during COVID.  They need to get their revenue back up.  Expect to see a lot of advertising for these surgeries.

1. Hospitals and medical providers deliberately mark up prices way beyond what is reasonable, AKA $100 for one table of OTC ibuprofen (Tylenol). 

The massive ""nonprofit"" hospital system in my area charges a $50-$100 ""facility fee"" EVERYTIME you visit any of their locations. Not covered by insurance. What does that fee cover? Building expansions and things like walls of giant TV screens displaying ads for the hospital and elaborate courtyards with fountains. 

2. This is the only first world nation on Earth that lets its citizens end up in bankruptcy or that allows liens to be placed on one's home, or lets paychecks or bank accounts be garnished, all over medical debt."

He paid $200 for his bad choices.  My 16 year daughter had a bunionectomy last year, I paid $200 for her surgery.  I am fully aware of how lucky I am to have this kind of coverage.

2021-05-21 14:53,"I don't want to alarm anyone, but those of us who have congenital or chronic health problems have been under this sword of Damocles for most of our life, or all of it. 

Should I seek care for a congenital brain condition? I feel sort of weird, but all in all OK. If I ignore it, it could lead to more brain damage, paralysis, or death. If I call a neurosurgeon, he says his soonest appointment is 4 months away. If I go to the ER, they're not trained in neurosurgery, they spend $6,000 to tell me they don't see anything. 

Ten months and $100,000 later, the one neurosurgeon who finds something says ""I wish you had come to us sooner"" - but of course, going to him sooner was not permitted by my insurance company who suggested I exhaust all other possibilities first. 

I did everything I was supposed to do. I still owe thousands. 

My brain is a mess. I don't trust myself anymore. 

So the bills will go unpaid. Because if they want to collect, they can explain how they let me go in debt while still getting sick; my life is derailed so that I cannot work, yet I'm going to be pursued by bill collectors for the rest of my life. 

If I say, ""OK, I give up, you can stop treating me now, I don't care how bad it gets, I'll just let it go""  -  they call that depression and ""mental illness"", which generates another bill, if not a ""wellness check"" by the State Police outside the house with his hand on his gun holster.

I ended up with $20,000 in medical bills by the age of 27. 

My daughter nearly died of a respiratory virus as a three week old infant. $10,000 in out of pocket expenses, with insurance.

Three years later, as a healthy 27 year old, my colon became infected and ruptured, nearly killing me. Another $10,000 in out of pocket medical expenses, again, with insurance.

I filed for bankruptcy at 29.

Now, several decades later, my husband, at only 55, has several serious chronic health issues that will inevitably leave him disabled and unable to work, before retirement age. Medical bills are already rolling in daily, despite us being insured.

We will likely end up in bankruptcy again at some point.

Don't say ""That will NEVER happen to me, because I'm healthy"", because it CAN happen to you too."
2021-05-21 16:09,"One way to deal with medical expenses would to charge each patient in proportion  to his income. If billionaires had to pay $20,000,000 for an air ambulance ride, things might start to look differently."
2021-05-21 16:10,"I can't think of a better argument for single payer health care:  look at Anthem, United Health Care, and Aetna (owned by CVS now) and their balance sheets.  Many of the hospitals who are balance billing or refusing to properly code procedures received huge sums of payments from Covid relief programs:  look at their balance sheets.  These entities have only themselves to blame for moving us towards single payer. They're just making money while they can before single payer comes."
2021-05-21 15:08,"The approach of making care for one affliction ""free"", while another is priced predatory and extortionate, worse than idiot stupid dumb...

To “out of network” gotchas – add “not for COVID” surprise billing…

It makes the rest of our capitalism out to be – in the eyes of the rest of the world – predatory and extortionate...

Oooh – it is, you say…

Making my point…

Not all of it is, but if some of it is, in ways that affect all of us, capitalism – which gave the US global leadership in virtually every non-agrarian industry, for at least a time – and predation/extortion become distinction without difference…

What should – but won’t – be done, is to make the US 𝙥𝙧𝙚𝙫𝙚𝙣𝙩𝙞𝙫𝙚 health care system the best on the planet…

And 𝙛𝙧𝙚𝙚, to 𝙖𝙡𝙡…

More specifically, all clinical diagnostics, including:

> Genomic
> Imaging
> AI-aided inference

And vaccines, should be freely and regularly and conveniently available to all…

It’d be analogous to free public sector K-12 education – followed by multiple options for college…

PS

Joe, your proposed 15% global minimum corporate tax makes much sense…

(though the 28% domestic rate’ll take us back to almost $0 on the corporate Laffer curve, where revenue goes to $0 at 30% – vs 100% for hapless US consumers)

Suppose we spent 15% of all HC spending on preventive care – i.e., about $1,500 per person per year…

PPS

If China gets there first – we’ll become a global joke in this arena…

Indeed, Covid and it's knock on effects makes great and horripilating news-people being literally beggared by medical billing companies and the hospitals and doctors they represent. Truly the stuff of nightmares.

What did you all think was going on when the Reagan administration deregulated the health care industry and created out of thin air this arbitrary and ridiculously complicated coding scheme? The complication is a purposeful feature, not an unforeseen bug.

I was working at a hospital, studying pre-med at university, and dating a neonatologist when he warned me that being a doctor as I had grown up knowing it would go the way of the dodo once Reagan was done wresting administrative control of hospitals from doctors and nurses and handing it over to businesses school grads and private profiteers. He was right. The hospital where I worked was a community service run by nurses and doctors themselves and administered by a kindly older man whose father was one of the physician-founders and was fully dedicated to carrying out the vision of the caregivers. While I was there, he retired and the most self-entitled, arrogant jerk with an MBA arrived and quickly destroyed the spirit of the institution. 

I was lucky to have a front row seat at the beginning of my adulthood because I would have been miserable today. I gave up the idea and never looked back. Meanwhile, my ex was harassed by the metastasizing conglomerate that nickle-and-dimed his world-class care in order to increase shareholder value, NOT the quality of patient care, and eventually chased from that hospital."

2021-05-21 16:23,"In my opinion the health insurance companies are not really interested in fixing coding errors. I've run into the situation where certain annual tests are free.  However they were coded incorrectly. It's next to impossible to get the coding fixed. Granted this was for less than $100.

They're not interested in fixing the issue as they know a certain % will just pay.

What needs to happen is that the States need to set penalties with a certain percent going direct to the aggrieved party.  Sort of like the old supermarket rule of the price is marked incorrectly for a lower price you get it at that price. (Still happens. I bought a 5 pound ham for 6 cents a month or so ago.)

You'll suddenly see coding errors disappear or fixed on the first complaint.

Until you make the service providers to get it right via penalties and the insurance companies tied into that penalty pain, it will never change."
2021-05-21 16:16,"This is a systemic problem that applies to much more than the USA's absurd health system. The cultural foundation is an obsession with individual freedom and  always looking after number 1. This does not only apply to Republicans and shows itself in myriad ways, not just the everlasting complaint of ""I don't want my taxes being spent on other people's healthcare. Let them look after themselves!"" For example, so many human relationships are so transactional that it is almost impossible for people to stay together. There is a distinctively American disfunctionality in human relationships of all types, passing from generation to generation, that leads to a remarkably selfish society.

The healthcare system won't be fixed until the anomalously selfishness of US culture is also cured. When will that happen?

Aetna, my insurance provider at the time, decided retroactively to classify the surgery as entirely cosmetic and denied all reimbursement!

Think about a triangle, in each side is :Accessibility, Cost and Quality. Now you can choose only two of the three sides. Unfortunately it is unrealistic to achieve a system where all medications and services are easily accessible, inexpensive and of very high quality. The government throws money at problems hoping some will reach its target, but a lot gets wasted. I am talking about what iwas spent to dampen the effect of Covid  and still left many people with horrendoous bills.
Ultimately we, the patients, are responsible for the present status, manipulated by drug companies and PR Lobbyists. How? Any rational system of rationing is a death panel, any cost control on medications will prevent the development of new and wonderful drugs. Those are misconceptions but work so well in the psyche of the public that freezes most representatives from taking meaningful action on improving our health care system. So, do not complain about having lost control, do something organize and act upon it. Do you want to only partially solve this issue , or you want to have a more rational system for now and the future?

Drive down the main drag in Sarasota or Naples, they're populated by opulent medical buildings, their parking lots filled with the priciest cars that money can buy. No wonder efforts to create government funded health care plans are dead in the water. Its opponents have always been able to outspend and out lobby its proponents. Something is out of whack."

For the past quarter century I've been dealing with people who suffered catastrophic injuries and illnesses. They often lose their homes and have to declare bankruptcy. When what became Obamacare was being considered, a single payer system was taken off the table. Physicians who came to Congress to advocate for it were arrested.

For instance, you can rack up $30,000 just by spending a few days in the ICU. Regardless of how much your insurance begrudgingly pays, if you come out alive, in addition to long term health issues, you could be ruined financially. How much simpler and cheaper to have worn a mask and kept your distance? How much less dangerous to get a shot and keep your health and savings secure? 
Though none of the precautions are 100% fail safe, all one has to do is look at the numbers to see they make the best sense. It's when you have an entire political party preaching ""Personal Freedom"" and ""Absolute Rights"" instead of ""Responsibility to the common good"" that a whole segment of society goes deaf to rationality and reason. 
All these people taking their chances with the virus, and those vastly fewer who've done it all right and gotten sick anyway, are ending up making somebody very rich. Can it be they owe some of it to the Party that's bringing in the business?"
2021-05-21 16:34,"In April 2020, my husband contracted Covid.  I begged the police and paramedics to bring my husband to the hospital where most of his physicians are affiliated.  That hospital was in-network and 5 miles from our home.  They said they had to bring him to the nearest hospital, which was an out-of-network hospital and 1.7 miles away.

I called our health insurance company immediately.  It said it will pay the out-of-network hospital and doctors as in-network because we had no control over which hospital my husband was transported to.

After my husband was discharged, the insurance company reneged by deciding to pay the hospital and doctors as out-of-network.  The insurance company said I should have moved my husband to an in-network hospital.

My husband was too critically ill to be moved.  He was hooked up to a ventilator and a CRRT dialysis machine.  All area hospitals were filled to capacity with their own Covid patients.  No hospital would have accepted him as a transfer patient.  Yet, our insurance company insisted that I should have had him moved to an in-network hospital.

I emailed a complaint to Governor Cuomo’s office.  His office forwarded my complaint to the NYS Dept. of Financial Services.  When that office contacted me, our insurance company had come to its senses by agreeing to pay the hospital and doctors in-network."

I appealed to BCBS, they turned down my appeal, I contacted the state dept. of insurance and within days they forced BCBS to pay my bill.

What makes it work though is lawyers aren't allowed to milk the system and the health care industry isn't allowed to milk the sick, dying and injured at their most vulnerable moments.

There is no reason a hospital couldn't do that too.  Not to is simply shameful. It is not just the insurance industry; the hospitals knew the way around these issues too.  What this article is describing is a very important way our system is so messed up.  The billing codes had to change.  The rules were unclear.  I would think the rules from one insurer to another were unclear. Our complicated and stupid system always means that many people are charged when in fact even when they should not be.  This part of it should be fixable, right now.  Ban charges.  Okay, they did that.  Then publicize it.  Spend a tenth of the amount of money being spent on vaccine ads to make sure people know they should not be charged.  Set up a hotline. Staff it with people who know what they are doing.

Besides being the right thing to do, it would also create a genuine boost to the economy by liberating Americans from crippling debt that would only go to pay a parasitic and overbloated health care system without creating any added value whatsoever to the economy.

Second thought: this parasitic and overbloated health care system needs to go. All of it. There must be billions of dollars wasted in totally unproductive activities related to medical billing, creating stupid codes, chasing people for their money, bleeding citizens dry because they dared use a hospital to save their own lives. If there ever was a case for a single-payer system, this is it.

We left the US for the UK in 2012 and after 6 months returned on vacation to tie up some loose ends and to see our former friends and neighbors. My husband got very sick with a respiratory infection, and one of our former neighbours, a doctor, wrote him a prescription for an antibiotic (for free!). When I presented the prescription at the pharmacy, explaining our  'tourist' uninsured status, they freaked out and did not know what to do for a while. I explained that I just wanted to pay for the medication myself. After much kerfuffle, they found the 'cash' price for the medication - about $40 for a 5-pill course- and I paid it. The weird thing was - my husband had had that same medication a couple of years earlier, while insured - and the cost to us was a 20% - $60 co-pay! So the pharmacy was charging the insurance company  $300 for medication that cost $40 for cash. At that point, I realised what a racket the whole US 'health' system was - and was profoundly glad we were now safe in the arms of the NHS. The ridiculous US healthcare system is a primary reason we will never again live in the uS - and will surrender our US citizenships."
2021-05-21 17:34,"""Then came $1 Million in Medical Bills"" is certainly a scary headline, but it's not really  what happens.  Today, most people legally in the US can get insurance, through their employers, Obamacare, Medicare, or Medicaid.  Unless people make a choice not to buy insurance, they won't face million dollar bills.

Insurance usually doesn't cover all costs; there are deductibles and co-pays, and, thankfully, out-of-pocket maximums which limit annual costs, usually to no more than about $10,000.  It's a lot, but a far cry from a million.

The major issue described in this article is the special allowances for Covid-related disease, which would eliminate most  co-pays  and deductibles. One may ask: should covid be given more financial benefits than a diagnosis of cancer?  But unless one makes a decision to avoid purchasing insurance, there won't be million dollar bills.

There are issues, and the incredible complexity of our system of payment is near the top of the list. Another is the high cost of care in the  US, including drugs, compared to the rest of the world.  Part of the problem is that the US is subsidizing low drug costs in Europe and elsewhere. This has been true for years, and it's long past time Congress fixed it.

That's only a few of the reasons for high costs; there are others that need to be addressed. Fee for service incentives to overtreat is another, which is harder to fix. Defensive medicine is another problem, which can be addressed through tort reform."

Months later, we still kept receiving bills, finally my dad received a notice that his bill was going to collections. I called the hospital and they told me different stories. One story involved my father not giving his ins card and info. Well how was part of the hospital visit paid but the bigger bill was still outstanding? Another story was his address wasn’t correct or his ssn wasn’t correct. Finally I 3-way called the hospital with my dad’s ins co. Thank you to the guy on the other line, he stood up for us, and told them straight that they were double dipping. He was saying rule this and rule that of the ins code, which was sooooo impressive that after we hung up with the hospital I asked to speak to his manager to let them know they had an amazing employee.

Due to COVID, our primary care doctor was not seeing patients--in fact many resorted to telehealth. Not a substitute.  They were afraid to admit her to the hospital as she would have been exposed to COVID. As a result, we struggled to help her manage her pain. It became unbearable and she was finally admitted and was then placed in a rehab facility.  I could not see her but her care was atrocious.  She told me so.  Staff told her they were trying to save money at the facility.  She was released after 30 days a broken person. I am haunted by that experience.  At her 2nd facility (she had to be re-admitted) she got COVID. She passed away in March.  Now the bills are coming and I am frustrated, angry, and sleepless.

The one thing about being in a single payer system is that you have to worry about it getting overloaded. Nobody can be turned away if they haven't got any money; everyone's entitled to treatment.

2021-05-21 17:46,"My stepfather died  of what I suspect was from the virus, SARS CoV-2, in mid December 2019, in a nursing home in Westchester County, New York.  He had his own room.  It was a more expensive care facility.  

Though he had very good attendants and care from the private facility, he died within less than twelve hours, from what was misdiagnosed as pneumonia. He had a very high fever 12 hours prior, and was found dead in the morning.  The treatment he was provided was a dose of penicillin.  The facility determined that he choked to death.  They could not determine how that happened. 

My family was stunned and upset.  We delayed his memorial for March 2020.  It never happened due to the pandemic. 

But, I wonder if any of the charges for care and funeral, and his body's cremation might be covered, by some state or federal fund.  My stepbrother paid for his care out of his pocket. 

Andrew Cuomo, the governor covered up the nursing home data for both incidents and deaths due to suspected cases of Covid-19 of personnel and residents of elderly disabled care. 

I realize that this article is about medical insurance billing which is may I say, always a nightmare in the US.

No health care, gun violence, political violence, anti-maskers, inability to hold monied interests accountable, no safety net.  If you have a secure job with a living wage and benefits, you’ll do fine, until something happens to you.

The American mindset is almost like not offering cars with seatbelts or not having homeowners insurance available.  Speaking for myself, I’d still be as alive and well as I am now if I had never buckled up, and I’d still be in my house if I foregoed insurance.  But I’d be running an unacceptable risk.

I’m leaning towards encouraging my kids to get established and raise their own kids elsewhere.  If they do stay here, I’d encourage them not to live in the mean states, and maybe not even visit them."

This is how insurers and healthcare providers get around having to change their oppressive billing habits.  They tell Congress they'll ""voluntarily"" cover bills for coronavirus patients, then quietly bill them anyway.  If anyone picks up on their deception, they quietly pay those individual bills as a cost of doing business and carry on harassing the 99.9% who didn't have high-powered contacts.

The government should be keeping up with the data, but obviously the last administration had no incentive to do that.  So what we need is a nonprofit like the Covid Patient Recovery Alliance to gather that data and bring it before Congress.  And some elected officials willing to fight their donors on behalf of their constituents."

Well, we can begin by cutting the Pentagon's budget in half (it would still be the best funded military in the world) and taxing the wealthy and corporations who use loopholes to avoid paying their fair share.  The current medical system is a disaster--we pay far more for our medical care than any other nation on the planet and yet we consistently rank in the mid-30s for quality of healthcare and longevity.  We're not getting our money's worth as it is.  Time for a single-payer national healthcare system for all.   Now."

2021-05-21 18:18,"This article explains exactly what is wrong with our ""health"" care system.  It's not a health care system.  It's a wealth care system.  It doesn't cure anyone.  It leaves us with bills we can't afford, bankrupts us, overcharges us, and is too confusing for civilized language.  The only ones who benefit are upper management.  And even they can't always afford the cost of care.

What's the point of claiming to have the most innovative and best medical research on the planet when so many citizens of the United States can't afford care when and where they need it because of how our wealth care system is set up?  Narrow networks, high deductibles, out of network costs, incorrect coding of bills, poor communication between personnel but not when it comes to threatening patients with a collection agency.  

How much money do CEOs need to make?  How much money and valuable time is wasted when patients and their families have to negotiate the cost of a bill or decide if the care is worth the cost?  How many of us have gone without care we need because of the cost?  And how much has that hurt the country?

This system of ""care""  is not care at all.  It's punitive and wasteful.  We give our pets better medical care than we give the humans.  What does that say about how we regard humans in the US?"

I want to add that, while not suffering from COVID-related conditions to date and subscribing to a good health insurance plan, we have noticed that medical billers have begun stealthily using ""allowable"" codes that increase private insurance copays.  Examples:  My ophthalmologist's biller (without his knowledge) began billing for something that has always, in our experience, been charged as a necessary part of a proper eye exam--not refraction, but the equivalent of a primary care physician charging a diagnostic service fee to use their stethoscope to examine a patient's heart.  After good faith effort at reasonable explanation,  I sadly voted with my feet.  
Also, hospital-affiliated clinics and physicians who bill through a hospital (not all do) are now charging triple what they were as facility fees (e.g., free standing ""wound care clinics"" billed a total of $80/visit copay for the same followup procedure for which a podiatrist charges a simple office visit copay (in our case, $20)--with no pre-disclosure of the code used or amount of fees.  
We include a special addendum to each financial consent form we sign that explicitly requires the office/institution to itemize in writing all fees above a $20 office visit copay and obtain our signature in writing.  We refuse accountability on the original form if this is not honored. Mostly ignored."

2021-05-21 18:39,"To those of you who are natives of Europe or other regions where government-provided healthcare is a right, let me explain the American system to you.  

Our elected representatives go to Washington and one of the first things they learn is how to raise money for their next election campaign.  This fundraising can take as much or more time than doing the people’s business, for which they were originally elected.  

Among the more generous givers to these elected representatives are various elements of America’s for-profit healthcare industry.  Oh, the massive “contributions” they make are ostensibly called that, but in reality, they are nothing more than bribes which are handed over so that these representatives will ignore the wishes of their everyday constituents and push the interests of the healthcare providers.  This ensures that the providers will be able to grow their profits without interference and the system will not change for the better, but only get worse.  Since the average US citizen does not always have the means or the desire to pay similar bribes, we have no say in the matter.  True, we can try to replace these elected representatives, but rest assured that most new legislators will end up doing the same thing.  

Many of us would like a much more affordable, efficient, just and transparent healthcare system overseen by the government (or at least a public option), but the process described above keeps us as hostages to the current mess.

Any questions?"

First, the idea of a perfectly ""free"", friction-less market is a fantasy. A joke, and not a funny one. Cronyism, racism,  and outright fraud distort all markets. 

And the idea of delivering healthcare based on ""markets"" is barbaric. If you  - or worse yet your child - developed a sudden, splitting headache and started experiencing vertigo, you'd have and extraordinarily high ""demand"" for medical services at that moment.

If those in a position to deliver medical services to you - starting with the ambulance company all the way through your release from the hospital hours or months later - engaged in ""surge pricing"" they'd asked you your name then instantly/electronically asked Mark Zuckerberg and any other vendor of data about you to give input to enable their (the vendor's) algorithm to determine the probable range of your net worth, and then, using another part of the algorithm based on thousands of similar interaction with similarly desperate people with similar net worth, you'd be offered a ""market rate offer"". 

So if you have a 7-figure net worth your choice might be to die on the spot, or pay $75,000 for the ambulance ride. Take it or leave it.

2021-05-21 18:47,"Health care is a business, and is governed by the norms and practices of businesses.  Our health care system, our legal system, and our values make it difficult to interfere with businesses no matter what they do.   The worst thing that usually happens to businesses that are dishonest or unethical is that they have to give up part, usually a small part, of what they have earned.  The tobacco industry lied about cigarettes.  Big Oil lied about global warming (and these lies have taken on a life of their own, so that Big Oil's efforts to shut them down have not been very effective).  The Sacklers lied for decades about the addiction dangers of their products, and made billions, most of which the addicted and others who bore the cost will never get back.  Our drugs have been increasingly overpriced for years, and those who overpaid will never get that money back; they will be lucky to reduce future overcosts.

They agreed to the pay-in-full version. Situation dealt with. Went home.

Many states have filial responsibility laws/statutes which state the basic needs children must provide for their parents and this includes medical health needs. It is worth checking out the laws in states as they differ and the laws are not uniformly enforced or even very clearly defined. Specifically though regarding more common debt, if a child and parent are co-signees on any loan or are jointly named on a credit card, the child is responsible for any balance if the parent dies. But the filial responsibility laws are not so clear and as such may be used by creditors to try and squeeze family members for huge unpaid medical bills of deceased relatives. And they may have the right to take legal action against the family for the debt. Worth looking into."

Finally at the end of the month she was hospitalized and was in the Hospital for nine days and sent to rehabilitation. While getting ready for release she developed sepsis and was hospitalized again. Finally she was sent home for Palliative Care and later Hospice at home. The Bill was $340000 dollars,with Insurance covering $170000 dollars. Six month later we finally settled with the Insurance.

2021-05-21 19:32,"As a physician this is utterly unsurprising to me. Our healthcare system is truly the worst of all worlds. From the physician side, countless hours spent trying to provide the correct codes and paperwork to extract payment from different insurers who routinely deny payment for spurious reasons, a bureaucracy fraught with inconsistency and errors that, as noted here, get passed on to the patient, and take hours and often legal intervention to resolve. From the patient side, the stories here are completely commonplace — no one ever knows what they are going to be billed, whether it’s correct, etc. we need single payer now. And until that happens, I counsel all my patients who are surprised by their bills to contest them. Call the hospital CEO, call the insurer (don’t call me - Trust me, I am just as confused as you are by the system) but until you understand what the bill is for — don’t pay it. The system is completely broken."

The choice of a free vaccination vs possible death or possible bankruptcy is not a very difficult choice if you think about it.

Since the choice is one of free will, why are medical insurance companies willing to pay any part of Covid 9 related charges if their insured has not been vaccinated.  It is, after all, completely their fault that they got sick.  Why reward stupidity?"

The same senators from both parties say that their hands are tied; different presidents from both parties promise to “do something,” but never do. Every year members of the House, regardless of party, say they can’t do anything to address the healthcare crisis, because the “timing isn’t right,” or “this isn’t the year,” or whatever excuse they’re making up that day. Year after year, medical bankruptcies mount, the cost of insurance premiums goes up, insurance company CEO pay rises, coverage gets narrower. Life expectancy has actually gone down for Americans. And still, nothing changes. Why is that, NY Times? Inquiring minds want to know: Why, despite one financial tragedy after the next, does nothing change? Who exactly is blocking the measures so desperately needed to institute a real healthcare system that will benefit everyone? Please, start investigating and exposing these human public nuisances!"

If I need long term treatment like dialysis, cancer treatment, any kind of therapy, etc. that costs me 9€ per treatment. If I need more than 45 treatments per calendar year, all additional treatments are free.
If I pay 683€ of all the above during the calendar year, everything except shorterm hospitalisation is free for the rest of the year. Shortterm hospitalisation costs in this case 17,90€ per day.
And in every case, that's it. No hidden fees, no extra bills from doctors, hospitals, or anything.
Of course, we do have private system too, which is more expensive, but you may get operations, treatments and so on, faster. 
Yes, we do pay higher taxes than americans, but everybody can estimate his/her taxes in advance. We also pay our taxes on monthly basis so it is very controlled. If you are an employee, your employer withholds your estimated taxes from your salary every payday, so you can't get in debt with your taxes. 
It breaks my heart to read time after time, how one of the richest countries in the world runs its ordinary citizens in to a bankruptcy just because you lack such basic part of social structure, as public controlled reasonably priced healthcare in modern western society is."

Three months ago my wife fell and broke her hip.  Emergency surgery, 34 days in hospital, terrific nursing care.  She had arthritis in the hip which inhibited healing, so two days ago she had hip replacement surgery.  Three hours in the OR, and she's still in the hospital with terrific nursing care: zero dollars.

I have paid for my healthcare all my life through my taxes.  My care has never been tied to my employment (except for five years when I lived in Texas.)  This isn't socialism.  It's great medicine, and it's available to all Canadians.  

Here's how it works: I have a provincial healthcare card.  On it is my healthcare number.  When I go to a doctor or clinic they ask me for my healthcare number.  I give it to them.  They send the bill to the provincial healthcare authority, who pays it.  It's called the single payer system, and because there is only one payer, they can keep a lid on inflation.  Extra-billing (asking the patient to pay the provider for part of the cost) is illegal.  Our doctors are very good, and they still have more money than most other people.

This is just one of the reasons that Canada is rated as the best country in the world to live in."

2021-05-21 19:35,"During a pandemic, the society at large is at risk should individuals fail to seek care that might be associated with the disease causing the pandemic. At the outset of a pandemic, neither all symptoms or routes of transmission are known. Even now, questions remain with this coronavirus. Therefore successful pandemic response must include no costs for medical care such that even the poorest and most marginalized can be diagnosed and triaged. 
Nor can those seeking treatment take the risk of being charged if the sources of their problems are not associated with the disease in question; for otherwise the risk of payment would be a barrier to seeking treatment. 

It follows that anyone charging patients who have come forth would be guilty of a crime -- attempted theft -- using the weapons of the court. This, to the victims, is a form of armed robbery -- and should be treated as such. White collar thuggery is still thuggery. 

I realize this is an argument for fully socialized medicine at times of pandemic exigency. It seems that adequate pandemic responses require socialized medicine be present when needed; else the entirety of society is at risk. Since we cannot predict at the start of a pandemic that a pandemic has arrived, societal safety dictates free medical care and a means of monitoring increases in kinds of cases, as well as a program of ongoing evaluation of their causes. I repeat: else, the entirety of society is at risk."

Many members of the general public may perceive us as being part of the great big capitalist hospital machine that extracts the lifeblood of our fellow Americans but we are just the Mcdonalds cashiers at a franchise. Our salaries might be high but this is just a fraction of what the hospital is making. The enemy is the big companies that own the hospital systems. Physicians have devoted more than a decade of life to their education and as residents were woefully underpaid and abused by the hospitals (on a per hour basis residents are paid less than fast food workers). On another note in the last decade there has been a rapid proliferation of midlevel providers, NPs and PAs that have a fraction of the training of physicians. When these providers see patients the hospital still bills the patient for the full amount as if they were cared for by an MD/DO. The lobbying groups for these midlevel providers are very powerful and they have gained independent practice in many states. A significant number of Americans don’t even know the difference and are unaware they are not being cared for by an MD/DO. An analogy is you are on a plane flown by flight attendantd vs pilots."

I know doctors and nurses who have hundreds of thousands of dollars in medical bills after an injury or illness, some of them after accidents on the job or from illnesses contracted while working. Everyone, even well-off, is one accident or illness away from medical bankruptcy. Even Christopher Reeves and his family ran through their estate after his accident. This is ridiculous.

If a provider bills the insurance for say, $20,000, the insurer pays their agreed upon fee, usually 30%. (This can lead to balance billing for the patient, but doesn't always). If a provider bills the patient, they have to pay the entire fee because there is no negotiated amount.  It's worth it for the insurer to pursue the patient because they get more money if the patient pays.

I don’t want my tax dollars going to corporate welfare for for-profit, or for allegedly non-for-profit hospitals (non-profit as in not publicly traded and profits are supposed to go right back into the organization, which they do, but too often toward profiting highly paid executives with raises and perks.)

Instead, how ‘bout these hospital chains use my, and your, tax money-come-corporate-handout to lower the debts of patients and families who’ve already suffered tremendously, by lower fees generally, and by building capacities for the next “Big One” public health crisis?"

Amazingly the hospital and insurance company had pre-negotiated prices and the 'bill' was revised to only 20% of the total bill, $25,000.00. 
So, I had paid over $14,000.00 in yearly insurance premiums to the insurance company plus $5,000.00 out of pocket. Of the $25,000 that the hospital received, I actually paid nearly $20,000.00 of that cost, the insurance company paid the remaining $5,000.00.
If I had not had this insurance policy the hospital would have hounded me for $125,000.00. Remarkable! To say the least.

But this is how insurance companies work.  It is a feature not a bug.  If somebody makes a claim, the insurance company will deny that a particular charge is covered, then give you the run around.  Their business model is to sell people insurance and then pay as little as possible after the fact.  What kind of leverage does a person have against an insurance company?

Years ago when I attempted to get reimbursed for medical bills, I was given so many crazy excuses, it was clearly their normal way of doing business.  And my experience has been confirmed by everyone I have ever met who had to fight to get money from a medical insurance provider.  I was unsuccessful in the end and just paid off the hospital when they made me an offer for the exact amount of money that I had left in my bank account at the time, almost like they knew my account balance."

People in other developed nations can't believe this could possibly be real.  If we are not going to have a public-run health care system in which every person is guaranteed adequate health care, then, at least, the insurance companies should be forced to meet their minimum legal obligations.  But in our current political environment, that will not happen.  I hate the hours I have to spend now fighting with insurance companies to pay relatively minor medical bills.

I had every symptom in the book, but I didn't go to the doctor to confirm my self-diagnosis, because I decided that if I were going to die of Covid-19, I wanted to die at home and not alone hooked up to a ventilator.

Also calling in the health insurance commissioner of your state to help straighten out the mess can help. I finally did that with cancer bills.

Took them 6 weeks and that person said they never wanted to deal with my health insurance company or my state university provider billing dept ever again. Neither did I. Every single bill I was right and the other parties were wrong. 

Around 1/2 of the bankruptcies in the USA are from medical bills.

Because of this shortsightedness, the US — the wealthiest, most technologically advanced nation in human history — refuses to provide universal healthcare for all of its citizens.

This refusal, disguised as the insatiable beast of ever lower taxes, is shortsighted because those who are against universal healthcare don’t seem to recognize that while taxes might be higher, out-of-pocket medical costs would be significantly lower. While taxes might be higher, businesses would be more competitive in global markets if they were not saddled with the costs of providing health insurance to their employees.

Until you move to shore your public health and social security systems the USA will always  be as vulnerable as H.G. Wells Martians. Protagonists will  use the ire of those you leave behind to foment discontent and unravel your Republic."
2021-05-21 21:47,"I have gleaned from a lifetime of reading about the USA, that the reason social programmes are not supported by much of the electorate, is many do not want the benefits of their tax dollars going to black or brown people.
I realize that a number of your states who are called RED have voted for the Medicare Expansion only to have it vetoed by GQP governors.
Obviously, with the poisonous political scene in your country, probably any progress to a National Health Programme is impossible."

2021-05-22 0:05,"As my sister, just 53, experienced a near-fatal heart attack just after midnight Christmas morning during a blizzard, she worried about being taken to the nearest hospital as it was out-of-network. She begged the EMTs to take her to an in-network facility.

They stabilized her at the out-of-network hospital and about 7 hours later moved her—at her insistence—before the emergency stent procedure. Of course we didn’t know as covid was rampant and she couldn’t inform her husband or family of her move to an in-network hospital.

But during what might have her last moments on earth, really? She was thinking about her potential medical bills? Why? 

Oh, right: she lives in the US.

She underwent triple bypass surgery 5 weeks later in early February. She’s doing extremely well now—but I know she’s spending far too much time stressing over insurance benefit statements and billing codes and medical bills. Likely not the best strategy for what will now be a lifelong health management process to reduce serious heart disease stressors. 

(We have a very strong family history heart disease.  Father age 61 died riding his exercise bike after open heart at age 50 decades ago; paternal grandfather at 53 was found dead; brother at 34 died on a Monday morning at his his at IBM despite a stress test he’d had, and sister at 40 after emergency gallbladder surgery.)

I really miss living overseas. Time for us to plan retirement in a compassionate, civilized country."

By the time she was 27 she was having laser surgery on her eyes.  When she turned 38 her birthday present was a new kidney and pancreas.  I have been a Union carpenter for 38 years and have bullet proof insurance so we ran her bills through my insurance and then through hers as a secondary pick up coverage.  The short story on the math is that when she died in 2017 I was left with about $75,000 in unpaid medical bills we tried to manage for two decades.  The good news is that the insurance covered over seven million dollars in expenses including two amputations, the dual K/P transplant, all the eye surgeries and much too much to list here.  Up until the pandemic took my job I had paid down the bills to about $30,000.  Such is life.  

Humor can take you to the other side of misery sometimes.  My wife ultimately died from a basil brain stroke.  It was inoperable and took her in less than twenty minutes.  I call it a stroke of good luck!"

It's basically like if everyone had the same health insurance that covers all necessary expenses with no deductibles or co-pays. My husband spent four days in the hospital a few months after we arrived. He received excellent care, and we paid $0. We couldn't believe we could just walk out and not stop by the billing office on the way out, and not a single bill arrived in the mail. Canada's system is far from perfect, but it provides excellent, universal care and no one goes into debt just to stay alive. Americans are getting played."

We both got FREE health care for us and our children so we were effectively triple covered. My wife was diagnosed with stage four ovarian cancer and went for surgery and chemo a month after the operation. I followed up on every bill and eob and after about a year she was cancer free and I thought I owed 147$ to someone. Five years later the local hospital was purchased by a large conglomerate and I got a letter saying that they thought I owed 150$ but they weren’t sure but if I wanted to send them a check they would return it if they were wrong. Now I’m retired and have only TRICARE and my wife has that and Medicare we drive over 800 miles to see our primary care physician because we can’t find a doctor that accepted our coverage. If it wasn’t for us having grandkids I’d be in Europe for the health care and the culture.

There needs to be continued press on this matter until Attorney Generals and Congress acts.  People, who are perfectly capable of working, of living rent-free, off of unemployment, and getting a free tax-payer ride.  Meanwhile, stimulus money was handed out to gainfully employed people when the focus should have been charging off covid-related medical bills.

Turns out, he was out-of network and billed our daughter an additional out-of-pocket $2,000. My husband had a life-threatening EMERGENCY procedure at ani-network hospital but the on call surgeon was out-of network. He was not satisfied with the insurance company's compensation so, his ""balance due bill"" kept coming to us. The surgeon referred all of our calls to a third party, an off-site billing company. They threatened us with a negative filing against our credit rating if we did not pay. It took seven months, two written appeals to our insurance company, several conference calls between myself, the insurance company, and the doctor's billing agency to get them to agree and then to actually get the payment sent and the bills to us to stop.

Health insurance companies are not in the healthcare sector, they are in the financial services sector. Their entire business model is based on increasing premiums, reducing coverage, and rejecting as many claims as possible. They even reject claims of procedures that would be covered, expecting that a certain percentage of clients will not file appeals, so that the insurance companies can increase their profit margins. Medical insurance has become a parasitic business sector in the US, and this illustrates just how bad it has become."

Kristin's, (Houston) assertion of  ""... more pointless gloating comments from Europeans and Canadians about how great their healthcare is while Americans are still suffering with their horrible system"", struck a cord in me.

Our health system is not ""great""; at the moment it is just meeting the tremendous stress that covid is placing upon it. It doesn't cover everything and sometimes I have to wait longer than what is ""great"" to see a specialist or have a procedure. It is not ""great"" from the perspective of an American who has excellent health insurance, but...

 It is absolutely fantastic in that no individual, couple or family has to worry about going bankrupt to pay a medical bill.  It is not ""free"". I pay through my federal and provincial taxes but I pay far less here than what my parents do (who live in the US) when you factor in their yearly health insurance premiums. Financial concerns are never a factor in deciding to seek medical attention.  

This is not gloating - it is outlining what the US could also have, save for some crazy fear of ""creeping socialism"".  Caring and attending to to common good is not socialism but common sense. We see health care as a service not a business.  So could you"

It is true we do not have government funded prescriptions but most of those are covered by affordable supplement insurance carried by almost everyone. Almost everything else is covered, free of copays, deductibles and even premiums, for most of us.   I don't even think we pay that much more in taxes than most Americans.
Single payer health care is not a gateway to communism, it is just the agreement among people that health care is a basic human need and therefore a basic human right.  That is compassion, not communism or even socialism, for that matter.

The high cost of prescription drugs relative to other advance countries that pay far less.

The highly variable and outrageous inequities in the cost of health insurance and medical billing.

Fraud, wasteful spending, and criminal activity in American health care.

Obscene CEO and executive salaries relative to other countries, and how other countries regulate and control such abuse. 

Treating health care and medicine as a lucrative business and investment opportunity, rather than as a a citizen's right and a public service. Note how other countries manage to offer higher quality medical service at half the cost of American medicine.

The morality and ethics of medicine and health care in a democratic and fair society. As a German said to me at an international conference: ""How dare you Americans make outrageous profits and money out of people's sicknesses and suffering!""

Include the high cost of private ambulance ""service""; the effects of mergers, low competition, and monopolization on health care costs; and, of course, influence peddling and legalized bribery of politicians in America.

Please explain why health care in American costs far more than in any other country, yet the outcomes are no better and may well be worse than in other countries?"

And then, there is the young mother I know who had an emergency c-section last September and the next day was put on a ventilator for three weeks. She was hospitalized with breathing difficulties today. Will her current hospitalization be considered Covid-related?

It's a system that doesn't seem to care about patients' well being which is tied to the ease with which they can get the care they may need including financially.  Health care providers often seem more concerned with maximum billing than patients' outcomes.

Sure, waiting time for elective surgery may be longer in the public system, but all in all the public health system is fantastic. We've benefited from that system in both the UK and Australia for over 40 years. We will retire next year, but the cost of health care is the main reason to prevent us from returning to the US. Unfortunately it appears that like gun control the US is so heavily invested in a system that it is virtually impossible to change in any substantive manner. With guns it's the archaic right to bear arms and with health it's profit. Both too far gone I'm afraid.  Hopefully in my lifetime there will be change, but I'm doubtful."

Charge codes are the problem not only with Covid-19 billing but with all healthcare billing. I know someone who works for a Medical Practice who's job is coding. She tells me that each and every Insurance Company has different codes and coding procedures. If you go to the Doctor's office with a strep throat the charge code is different depending upon which Insurance plan you are on. Simple solution is to require every Insurance Company to use the same standardized coding system. Of course this will simplify things and give Insurance Companies less excuses for turning down coverage."

Here in the U.K., no one has received a bill for any Covid health care. We also spend less on health care than the USA per head, with better outcomes. Yes it is not perfect, but because it is state run, elected office holders are accountable and they have to respond or be voted out."
2021-05-22 10:14,Having practiced medicine for a while I have to say that as soon as the government determined that health care is a human right to be protected by the government and financed by the government we needed to get rid of fee for service.  Doctors should be on salary with no bonus for anything including productivity and patient satisfaction.  Why?  You always get more of what you incentivize with money which also means that if your incentivize giving patients what they want as opposed to what they need it will not be cheap.  While doctors in the US make twice as much as doctors in Europe that is not the big cost driver.  It is tests and procedures.  More doctors will not lower costs.  Doctors from third world countries come to the US to have a US lifestyle and they order just as many tests and procedures and surgeries.  The only solution is doctors on salary just like police and paramedic firemen.

2021-05-22 10:51,"Reading many articles like this, I simply cannot fathom how the self proclaimed leader of the free world, does not care (both literally and figuratively) for their citizens. 

Universal health care, like what we have in Australia, means citizens can have free Covid tests, pre and post treatments. It is not just limited to Covid, of course, with the vast majority of tests and treatments covered by Medicare (our universal healthcare). 

It has bipartisan support and never enters into a political discussion. 

Perhaps the attitudes towards socialist policies need to be revisited, starting with a dictionary. It is not a communist ideal for the government to serve its citizens."

That would be Congress.

2. To provide the only motivation that can get Congress to act/move on something is (surprise, surprise) Money.

3.To ensure that the medical Health Care Reform and /or System most people want becomes reality are these 2 ways to provide more than enough motivation for Congress to act quickly and solving all current system areas/components are:

A. Make it a law (Signing a Petition with 50 million Citizens signature on it , should work) that all members of Congress are responsible for the cost of all their medical costs, expenses, checkups, tests and drugs until all Americans are covered for all their health needs and costs. 

OR

B. Have Govt fund all election costs (including advertising etc )up to a specific limit and ban all forms of Lobbying (known elsewhere as bribery ) and regulate Donations better and tighter .

By paying just a portion you automatically agree to the rest, even if you don't. So don't pay until you have a clear bill. I also found that some will double bill under different company names, so keep checking amounts against other bills. No, they can't ruin your credit if all is still in flux as you wait for explanations. It can take months for all the bills to arrive, and by that time they are sending doubles, some from collection agencies that you should just toss in the trash. Stay with the original bills.

Hospital ""systems"" recieve lots of federal dollars but have very little financial regulation. There are significant health disparities that result, even among the middle class.

If you are unlucky enough  with high deductible policy, your insurance is practically worth nothing unless it is your annual check up or a dental cleaning. ""Oh, we have applied the discounted rate for you"" is the usual refrain when you try to question the charges. When your check your insurance statement from time to time you notice that your provider had billed the insurance for $120 and got reimbursed $18.47 - so where is the truth?  Yet you keep getting bills in the mail something you thought your insurance had already covered. Your insurance company does not care how much your health care provider will bill you for. So how are you protected? You need to be medically qualified to understand all the exclusions on your health care policy that can run into hundreds of pages.  Most policies sold in the market place is practically worthless for the policy holder (with its high deductible), whereas the insurance companies are handsomely rewarded with government subsidy on the low income group.

Disparaging the pandemic meant many, if not most, of the 47% flaunted public health measures (remember large unmasked MAGA political rallies?) whereas at least a large portion of the remaining 53% of the population tried to support public health measures.  If the recommended public health measures had any efficacy it seems likely to me that more than 1/2 of those with large hospitalization bills went out of their way to deserve them.

""The for-profit health care system is literally killing people ...""

It may be a minor point, but I believe the use of the term ""for-profit health care system"" tends to obfuscate the commonly-held image of what we are debating when we discuss such fiascoes as those in the article. I think the ""for-profit health insurance system"" is the crux of the issue and should always bear that name.

Medicare is _not_ a "" health_care_ system."" It is a (single-payer) not-for-profit health _insurance_ system, though it insures clients of a for-profit health _care_ system. I think there is much semantic value in insisting that we discuss the issue in terms of what to do about the for-profit health _insurance_ system in the US -- insurance, insurance, insurance ... Public discourse about this should always use the word ""insurance.""

If the US for-profit health _care_ system is a problem (not saying it is or isn't), it can be addressed as a separate topic simultaneously or in due course."

We CAN do it. It's been done. CUNY was free (until the year Black students started enrolling at much higher rates) and could be free again. Many politicians/celebrities went for free. NYC signs uninsured people up for subsidized insurance if they come to the ER. We have many free and sliding scale health services if you know where to look. They are not allowed to turn people away. People give false names and the state absorbs the cost.

Universal health care is paid by a specific tax, on a sliding scale, by income.  If you make less than 20k, you pay nothing but are covered.  If yoy make 20k - 200k, you pay on a sliding scale.  That scale is capped at 200k.  If you make $200,000 or more per year you pay $900.  Yes, $900.  Per YEAR for health care.  Broken leg?  Just go in, it's covered.  Complicated pregnancy?  Covered.  Infected splinter?  Covered.  Some years ago there was a tuberculosis outbreak in a homeless community.  Everyone's care, testing, hospitalization, and immunizations were covered.

2. Place your story online through a Google Doc or similar. 
3. Then use social media to @ firms, shaming and naming and linking to story. (Typically they try to reach agreement offline. Apology will be offline.)
4. Contact your local media; send to one person (not a catch all email) at a time. Try hyperlocal news, AM radio and podcasts. Does your TV news have a consumer reporter at their station?

My doctor said it’s probably not a tumor or MS so you can skip to for now...wow comforting...

It's about the greed of our medical system.  This abuse of our health care system will not change until we can get politicians to stop taking bribes from the medical and pharmaceutical industries in the form of very large campaign contributions.  We need to make it illegal for PACs AND corporations to contribute to campaigns and set limits as well.  Anybody with a TIN rather than an SSN should be barred from contributing more than $1,000.  No PACs at all.  We used to have a law like this, I thought, but I'm not sure what happened to it.  Reforming health care won't happen, UNLESS... we reform campaign finance.

Or we could choose the better option and have healthcare for all.  The United States has the most expensive healthcare in the world and yet we do not have the best results.  We are high up the list for losing babies, pregnancies, and the ones who suffer most are the poor.

The collapsed medical system, that perhaps only works for VIPs, not for the regular citizen.

Any head of state in a truly democratic nation would have resigned by now instead Modi’s propaganda army is busy spreading falsehoods to blame other factors for the pandemic.  All of his lofty statements run contrary to his actions, his lofty statements were meant just to get the votes.

A few days back I have written in NYT comments sections about the shocking level of profiteering that is happening in India with scamsters/profiteers targeting desperate people in the absence of much support from the government. Till now, I have only heard of moral/ethical nihilism in philosophical circles, but the instances of scamming/profiteering brought out in the article are examples of moral/ethical nihilism in practice. This shows that we are not only a pathetic third world country in terms of health care, but also in terms of ethics. 

Meanwhile the central (federal) government of Narendra Modi is still in the job of curtailing free speech. A few days back, some posters came up in Delhi criticizing Modi's handling of the vaccinations. The police have arrested about 25 people in this matter as if this is the most important task currently required. A complete shame on the Narendra Modi government. With such monumental mishandling of the pandemic, one would expect Modi's popularity to plummet. However, I am not sure if this is happening.

And, the deal was that their wealth and connections would allow the politically powerful middle and upper classes to avoid bearing the brunt.  COVID is self-evidently different, cutting a deadly swath across the country, classes, religions, castes, city/town/village, etc.
In deeply troubled times, every flaw is heightened, so the profiteering, etc. should be no surprise.  Recovery will be a long and hard path, but perhaps Indians will draw the right lessons from this disaster and move forward with solidarity and courage."

Not a single British or European, and even the 3% to 5% % of the total 12 % literate enabler Indians, who worked for the Colonizers and enjoyed the privileges, the rest 78% did not. Even the starvation of about 4 million Bengali Indians by Churchill’s intentional policies in the thick of WW II (see page 160 of “Inglorious Empire by Shashi Tharoor) did not make them revengeful and kill them. 
Sixty eight percent of the population lived in extreme poverty due to taxation and bribes they had to pay for most services to the enablers of the British rule. 

Nehru, became PM being the leader of Congress party, decided to follow the USSR economic model but without compulsory education.
