Millions of people are refusing to take a vaccine approved by the FDA to prevent COVID.

Meanwhile, people are self-treating and/or demanding doctors prescribe a drug that has never been approved in any capacity for treating or preventing COVID.

2021-08-30 12:00:31,pssst...the vaccine is free.
2021-08-30 12:00:53,"We have to stop looking for logic from these people. There is none. 

I have a very close relative, a college-educated professional living in an urban center, who for the past year has said that Covid: is a hoax; only required hand-washing; could be cured by hydroxychloroquine; is a scam by medical device manufacturers to make more profits; isn’t really any different than a typical flu season, etc. 

And then he and his kids got Covid, he got very sick, and fortunately he survived. But now he says it was Ivermectin that cured him, the vaccine is a hoax by the drug companies to make more profits, and that the rest of the family shouldn’t get vaccines because they’re too dangerous and have unproven future consequences. 

The only logical, consistent thread I can find and all is this is that he somehow knows far more than the rest of his well-educated family, including his wife – who is a doctor.￼"
2021-08-30 12:01:57,"I think there is a high degree of probability that these poor souls clamoring for Ivermectin are in the grip of fear, primarily fear of losing face, secondarily fear of the coronavirus. Having nailed their colors to conspiracy theories they daren't take the vaccine for fear of ridicule from their like-minded friends, to do so would invite ridicule and worse. Yet, they now witness the suffering and death of family and friends and it is dawning on them that there is no hoax, coronavirus is real, and they are sitting ducks. This is their last-ditch attempt to save themselves - without selling out. How ironic, terrified of minimal medical intervention, only to end up in a medically-induced coma, at the ""mercy"" of the most extreme medical interventions, tubes inserted forcefully at multiple sites. No wonder many are pleading for the vaccine as they lie helpless ""in extremis""."

""Conclusions: Meta-analyses based on 18 randomized controlled treatment trials of ivermectin in COVID-19 have found large, statistically significant reductions in mortality, time to clinical recovery, and time to viral clearance. Furthermore, results from numerous controlled prophylaxis trials report significantly reduced risks of contracting COVID-19 with the regular use of ivermectin.""  from:

2021-08-30 12:02:40,What ethical doctor would prescribe such medication to a patient for COVID
2021-08-30 12:03:02,"I think there needs to be some context. Ivermectin is a safe and widely used medication world wide. It may or may not have some efficacy as an adjunct to COVID treatment, but to suggest there’s not some degree of disagreement in clinical practice on this is inaccurate. The evidence is increasingly suggesting it is not very effective, to be clear.

At normal dose it has a wide therapeutic safety margin and is very unlikely to cause harm or interact with other medications. For people choosing to take it despite little strong evidence it does much, I give a big shoulder shrug. There are bigger hills to die on for getting people to make smart choices re their health."

Of course they hope horse deworming pills work! In that dreamworld local knowledge trumps the guys in the science coats in labs on the East Coast. And, it’s a treatment that won’t leave you with a pile of insurance claims and bills you can’t pay. The dream of a cure-all pill is as American as you can get.  

We wouldn’t be here if we had had a fair an equitable healthcare system, a public educational system that provides basic knowledge and if there were more hope in some of these communities."

2021-08-30 12:05:02,Prevention first. Cure is unnecessary if the proper preventive steps are taken. It is that simple for people to take a vaccine if their Doctor recommends it for their situation.
2021-08-30 12:05:38,"This is not rocket science.

All providers who inappropriately prescribe Ivermectin should be reported to their State medical boards for sanctions, including suspension and possible termination of license.

All talking heads on social media and TV who recommend Ivermectin and other looney cures should be sued by patients and their families for resulting illness and deaths.  They should also be sued by government entities and insurance companies for recovery of funds expended in treating Ivermectin overdoses.

It is used in dogs, e.g., to treat parasitic worms, mange, and other similar ailments. Some dogs carry a gene that makes ivermectin particularly dangerous. I had a pure-bred Australian Shepherd that was treated with ivermectin. In short order the dog became paralyzed in all but his involuntary muscles. The cost to test for the genetic trait cost $60, and had the vet tested the dog itt would have spared the dog this ordeal and saved us the $800 one night in the pet ER cost us. We were told the dog would either recover or die and there was no way to which. To the vet's credit, they nursed the dog back to health without charge to us, but it took two months waiting for the dog to move. I do not know if humans carry a similar gene. Does anyone? Want to take a chance with a paralytic? Good luck. If you want to prevent severe COVID, roll up your sleeve and get the shot. No more excuses. You are NOT being vaccinated to prevent COVID. You are being vaccinated to prevent ending up in the ICU on a ventilator followed in all too many cases by your death.

It's been mentioned plenty of times, but for emphasis:

When I worked in agriculture, I administered thousands of doses of ivermectin to cattle. They did not enjoy it. Once released from the squeeze chute (used to hold them still while we quickly injected the white paste into their mouths/throats), they stood around leaking white drool and blowing white bubbles, tongues often flicking in and out of their mouths in an effort to rid themselves of what I can only imagine was a bitter, awful taste.

Now, I can't say for sure that it's bitter and awful, because you know what? I was smart enough never to put any in my own mouth.

That thousands of Americans are will to go all-in on a drug whose effectiveness against COVID appears to be nil, but who are wildly, vociferously doubtful of an FDA-approved vaccine says all too much about where this nation is — and, I'm afraid, where it's going."

2021-08-30 12:52:31,"I have a friend and a brother, both very smart individuals, who are convinced ivermectin is a legitimate treatment for covid-19. I point them to NYTimes articles like this, which are highly cited and referenced, and the scariest part is that they don't believe any of it. They think the authors of this article are lying to you, that the doctors are lying to you, that the data presented is manipulated to support some preordained conclusion by ""the MSM"" (mainstream media). You then ask them for their sources and they point you to some sketchy-looking website that quotes one random study that's since been discredited, or quotes a doctor who has usual been sanctioned by some medical board or such. I don't understand how smart people fall into this misinformation black hole, but I am convinced that this is the core issue we need to address as a society: the horse dewormer is just a symptom of a much larger psychological problem."
2021-08-30 12:55:23,"It is astounding that people are so ignorant that they won't take the vaccine while they will believe some lunatic on the internet or right-wing media and take pills made for horses and cows. That is clearly proof that, as LIncoln noted, ""You can fool some of the people all of the time.""

Fortunately, there are sane individuals who are getting their vaccines (although belatedly): more than 1.1 million shots adminstered the other day. That is the only way we are going to get out of the pandemic."
2021-08-30 12:56:15,"I have an idea for universal vaccination here in the US. Let the CDC discourage the use of Modena, Pfizer, etc. Then we can be sure that all the contrarian ‘COVID is a hoax’ folks will flock to to the vaccines."

2021-08-30 12:56:57,"Interesting that the Internet is worldwide, meaning the info on this drug is widely disseminated. However, it appears it’s only in the US that people are rushing to take this drug, which further incriminates FOX “news” in this misinformation. The only potential upside is that since ivermectin is used to treat parasites (not a virus) perhaps it will wipe out the Trump parasite so deeply implanted in MAGA brains."
2021-08-30 12:57:18,"At this point, I’m over it. When people are refusing to get a vaccine and are sick and dying in droves in a hospital, when people’s failure to protect themselves or others has resulted in variant after variant plaguing the rest of us, literally! I have no sympathy for folks who are seeking the use of a drug that has consistently been proven to show ineffective against this virus, and even going so far as to procure it illegally and overdose themselves on it. I mean I’m supposed to have sympathy for those folks? I have neither the mental nor emotional bandwidth for these folks. I’m stuck in the house for another year along with my sons because my youngest is too young to get the Covid vaccine. And kids are turning up at school and at home infected and infecting others. I’m a go ahead and worry about me and mine and make sure our I’s are dotted and our T’s are crossed.￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼ The rest of these people are welcome to compete in the Darwin awards as far as I’m concerned.￼￼"
2021-08-30 12:57:19,"In other words, the common argument against the vaccine (that it is not adequately tested) is a farce among these people. So we have to dig deeper to figure out the real reason why so many are turning away from protection from the virus."

2021-08-30 12:47:39,"I have an anti-vaxx business associate who believes she is protected against covid by her ""gut health."" She religiously follows a chiropractor who has actually been charged by the FDA for promoting quack cures. And of course this doctor makes his living selling supplements. 

So let's see......a free vaccine successfully protecting hundreds of millions of people OR herbal tonics and horse paste from a guy who wants to sell you something??

I am so officially DONE with all of these people. If they're this gullible and/or stupid, I truly don't care anymore."
2021-08-30 12:38:32,Since when did we become such a purposefully ignorant people? Seems like a sizable portion of Americans simply reject science and facts.
2021-08-30 12:54:08,It is my understanding (based on clips shown on Rachel Maddow’s cable show) that several Fox News television “personalities” have been recommending these horse pills as a Covid remedy.  Might NYT report on the serious ethical and misleading claims made by Fox.  Might lawsuits and the media hold these liars legally and financially accountable?
2021-08-30 12:46:55,"This is a success for Fox News.  Their commentators have convinced their viewers to use a drug that doesn't work, and avoid a vaccine that does.  Congratulations Sean Hannity, Tucker Carlson, and Laura Ingraham.  Those guys really should offer to pay for funeral expenses.

Why has no-one been charged?  Why is it, as a country, we sit on our hands and allow stupidity and greed to reign?"
2021-08-30 12:50:36,Let's simplify: no Americans have died because of the vaccine. Over 700 thousand have died from Covid. That's all we need to know. Everything else is irrelevant.

The doctors prescribing ivermectin should be sanctioned by the AMA and threatened with losing their license for prescribing an off label drug for which there is no evidence whatsoever of efficacy in treatment of or prevention of Covid 19.￼.

2021-08-30 13:02:16,"These must be the same doctors who prescribed buckets of opioids only a couple of years ago.

It's amazing to me that anti-vax derps are all about sneering at us for 'bowing down to big pharma', the makers of COVID vaccines.

Ivermectin is made by Merck. It's not exactly a 'non-pharma' option. 

My sister will soon run out of her RA injection med, cuz now the main ingredient is in short supply. Profit demands that it go to ivermectin right now, as people rush to buy one pharmaceutical to avoid... taking a pharmaceutical.

Doctor: 'Sure, I'll prescribe ivermectin, I'm getting a kickback from Merck with every one I write!' 

Do 'conservatives' not remember that this is EXACTLY why no one can get  opioids for chronic pain now?

Sheesh, 'owning the libs' has morphed into 'owning the vast majority', and only in service to contrary entitlement!"
2021-08-30 13:02:21,"There have to be changes.

1) If people can have higher premiums because they smoke, then anyone refusing to get the vaccine must have their monthly bill upped, say by $200 - $400 a month.

2) No vaccine? Then pay for your own Corvid test for the growing number of events that demand it.

3) It must be illegal for anyone to take drugs meant for animals and a criminal offense to give any of that to a child.

4) No more ""religious exemptions"". If superstition is your cure, then make sure that you are not wearing glasses, wearing orthopedic shoes, taking pills for any reason, using a hearing aid or eating a special diet to cure or ease a disease. Oh, and no cancer chemo.

The use of Ivermectin is the same phenomenon. The only difference is that the don't have a clue about the individual saying it is effective, where they come from, why they know what they do. They are ""Doctor"" such and such, ""a world expert,"" and ""have been fighting the 'medical establishment' for years.""

For me, I trust what the CDC says. The studies on Ivermectin as a treatment for the coronavirus lack careful and correct work, with no peer reviews and no double blind studies.  I'm not a medical person, but sometimes you just have to use your brain and think."

You only have free speech up to a point. These media outlets should be terrified of the financial liabilities from the injuries and deaths that they've caused. It seems like every week is a new ridiculous thing from these folks, and that's because that's their business model: endlessly riling up their base, appealing endlessly to emotions of fear and anger. The facts during this pandemic have remained constant: the virus is dangerous and deadly, and vaccines are safe and effective.

2021-08-30 13:13:58,"So let me get this straight.  Those anxiously seeking ivermectin are largely the unvaccinated, who refuse the vaccine because ""it was rushed"" and is, therefore, ""experimental"", or ""because they don't know what's in it"", or both. But those same people -- suddenly all scientists and infectious disease experts -- are willing to take a drug that has failed in clinical trial after clinical trial to be effective against covid. In both cases, they have no idea what's ""in"" either drug -- because they're not scientists, they just pretend to be to veil, albeit thinly, the real driver of their refusal to take common sense public health measures: politics. But in one case, that's an impediment to becoming vaccinated and in the other, not so much. And in one case, the relative ""newness"" of the drug raises questions about its efficacy, while the proven failure of the other doesn't.

Many of the same people who will not take the COVID-19 vaccines because they ""do not know what is in it or if there any potential long-term affects"".  However they are willing to take a drug they know nothing about and against recommendations of medical experts.  Yes, there are doctors like Rand Paul who are making these types of recommendations. Dr. Paul, is an eye doctor , who has never treated a serious infection outside of pink eye and you would not go to him to treat a flu or pneumonia. There are other incompetent doctors who believe you can magnetize people with a  vaccine (physiologically impossible by the way --from anything).

Many veterans have known these breeds are susceptible to Ivermectin for decades, but the gene was only identified in the last two decades and a gene test is now available.  Even so, many veterans are still unaware of how dangerous Ivermectin can be to such dogs.

2021-08-30 13:58:52,"Public health officials should respond to every false claim about ivermectin on social media. Even better: enlist some of the very few influential vaccine deniers who have changed their opinion of vaccines, to also debunk ivermectin. 
Unfortunately, it seems that many of the latter only regret refusing the vaccine, when they are already dying from COVID.

Pay for ads on right wing radio and tv programs, to reach those who don’t get all of their information from social media.

And don’t fund any more studies of ivermectin for COVID. It has already been proven ineffective."
2021-08-30 14:07:24,"Taken as a preventative Ivermectin can over time cause kidney and liver damage.  (The drug is usually given for a short time to treat parasites.). The kidney damage caused by ivermectin leaves the patient less able to fight COVID, which often attacks the kidneys.  While ivermectin might be able to kill COVID in a test tube, the concentration required to kill COVID in a person is much too high to take without becoming seriously ill or dying."
2021-08-30 14:08:18,"""Dr. Yu has refused the ivermectin requests, he said, but he knows some of his colleagues have not.""

First thought... that's insane. Why would it be happening? Why would doctors be willing to comply with their patient requesting/demanding an off-label prescription like this?

Second thought... oh, that helps make sense of the USA having its prescription-opiate disaster.

Patients as customers, prescription-medications being marketed directly to them, a litigation-based system of redress and professional medical ethics taking all the preceding as 'allowable factors' in defence of malpractice.

FWIW, no system is perfect but if they were all working within the UK's NHS Dr Yu's colleagues would know that not saying ""No"" to their patients would lead to problems for them. Whether in a hospital or GP practice the IT system would 'flag-up' their prescription to them if it mismatched the diagnosis they were recording... easy to over-ride at that point, but making it clear they should log an explanation for that decision if/when someone turns up asking about it. 

And... NHS prescriptions are taxpayer-funded, either totally or partially-subsidised (there's a £9.35 fee for non-exempt working-age adults, the main exemptions being pregnant women, full-time students and the unemployed... so the most a diabetic individual aged 16+ has to pay for a month's supply of insulin is c. US$ 14, regardless of income). Generics are standard, and 'oddballs' are scrutinised."

1) No scientific basis for a potential therapeutic effect against COVID-19 from pre-clinical studies; 
2) No meaningful evidence for clinical activity or clinical efficacy in patients with COVID-19 disease, and; 
3) A concerning lack of safety data in the majority of studies.

2021-08-30 14:09:47,"Some points of clarification amongst some of the erroneous comments here: Ivermectin was initially developed by Merck to treat humans. It is effective against two tropical diseases caused by parasitic roundworms in humans: Onchocerciasis (River Blindness) and Strongyloidiasis, as well as against insects that attack the skin (such as body lice). The person primarily involved in uncovering its usefulness (William Campbell, a friend of mine) received a 2015 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine). The name given to it is based on these 2 curative actions (“verm” for worms and “ectin” for insect ectoparasites).  It was later found to be effective against parasitic worms in pets and livestock, and Merck makes most of its money on these rather than on use in humans. Indeed, it makes so much money on these that it gives away the drug free to poor countries where Strongyloidiasis and Onchocerciasis are prevalent. Dosage is determined by body weight of the patient and no one should be surprised that horses tend to weigh more than humans. So, doses designed for horses are much higher than those for humans. I am not aware of any data that shows Ivermectin to be useful against viruses. But it likely is less toxic than injecting yourself with Clorox, as had been advocated by a former high ranking U.S. office holder."
2021-08-30 14:16:45,"""A recent review of 14 ivermectin studies, with more than 1,600 participants, concluded that none provided evidence of the drug’s ability to prevent Covid, improve patient conditions or reduce mortality. Another 31 studies are still underway to test the drug.""

Can someone explain why, if 14 studies have shown no effect, another 31 are ongoing? And why would a parasitic drug work to treat a virus?"
2021-08-30 14:20:54,"It is truly amazing that the people that will blindly follow YouTube videos and Facebook comments for their medical advice are also the people who confidently call the rest of us ""sheep"" because we respect doctors, and base decisions on data and science rather than rumor and anecdote.

It is YouTube and Facebook that convinces others that the Earth is flat and that the ""round Earth"" is a false idea promoted by a giant conspiracy.

The HCQ/Ivermectin/Anti-vax crowd is the medical equivalent of Flat Earthers.  How can they not see that?"
2021-08-30 14:11:14,"I agree with all the comments that taking IVM for Covid is not supported by the evidence at this time (although off-label use of drugs is not uncommon, and can be warranted, and it does come in formulations for people).  Also, taking the paste formulated for livestock is completely nuts.  But, it is disturbing to see so many comments saying that IVM, an anti parasitic, couldn't possibly work on a virus.  All you have to do is scroll to the end of the article and hit the link to the NYT March 4, 2021, article to see that IVM was put in trials because it did seem to suppress the Covid cells in the lab. Also, according to the March 4 article, at the time there were many countries that included IVM in their treatment protocols for Covid.  So, at some point it looked like it might be a useful treatment.  Doesn't look like that 's the case, and clearly folks should not be using IVM for Covid prevention or treatment at this point.  

A lot of comments also assume that everyone who is trying to get IVM is unvaccinated and/or anti-vax.  Might be true, but where is the evidence?

Maybe none of us are as smart as we think we are."

People don’t trust the Covid vaccine because either a) they “don’t know what’s in it” (although I would wager most of these people have eaten hotdogs or chicken McNuggets) and/or b) because it hadn’t been fully approved - but are willing to take a veterinary anti-worm pill about which they know nothing and which hasn’t been approved for Covid?

2021-08-30 14:33:58,"A month ago an extended family member who refused to get vaccinated, and is diabetic, contracted COVID while their spouse was in the hospital dying from a long battle with cancer. Masks were required to gain entry to the hospital and nearly all people wore them throughout the hospital but in the grieving areas, this family member and their family defiantly did not wear masks. Most were unvaccinated millennials. Those of us that were vaccinated and wore masks while indoors with other people did not contract COVID and tested negative. 

The funeral for the spouse had to be postponed for 2 weeks so the family could recover. When the indoor church service was held, few people wore masks, even those family members that had COVID and none of the family had gone back to ensure they were negative.  They all assumed it had been long enough and they would be negative. 

One of the ill and diabetic family members purchased equine ivermectin at the local farm supply store. Claims it is the reason for their faster recovery, despite other family who work in the medical profession advising them to not do so or risk great harm or death. 

There are so many things wrong with the experience in my own family, mostly because my knowledge and understanding of public health and disease transmission is based on science and facts and not politicized news and social media posts and disinformation news feeds. 

Same family has a wedding in 2 weeks & we fear there may be more illness and death by then."

Please if you’re not vaccinated take the vaccines that are available to you! I did and I’m alive and healthy like the 100 of millions of others who taken the vaccines. And please wear a mask!"

2021-08-30 14:34:44,"Let me get this straight: People are actually taking this stuff based on recommendations they heard from talk show hosts?

I can relate to skepticism about COVID vaccines. They seem almost too good to be true. They are over 90% effective at preventing infection, and at least equally effective at preventing serious disease and fatalities. They apparently have only mild side-effects which are thankfully quite rare. Given the stakes, I can support the desire to require a complete public airing of the data behind the claims of effectiveness. This has been done. The FDA even prolonged the approval process to be extra certain.

What possible rationale do people have for rejecting all of this data which incudes the vaccination of millions of people like them around the world only to  accept the word of complete strangers? 

This surely must be a form of mass hysteria/insanity."

2021-08-30 14:44:39,I suggest people read Sapiens by Yuval Noah Harari specifically the section on the demise of the Neanderthals. I am not calling people names but rather comparing them to today’s conservatives who will not take a simple FDA approved Covid vaccination but will without hesitation ingest bovine deworming medication or at least try the new medication that may cure Covid which is strange in that if you take the vaccine there is a 99 percent chance that you will not die from Covid whereas it is uncertain whether the cure medication will work or not. The only explanation is that like the Neanderthals conservatives have a cognitive glitch in their minds. For the Neanderthals that glitch was the inability to play even simple games and a failure to grasp the concept of trading whereas they hit an evolutionary dead end and disappeared. I’m afraid the same thing appears to be happening to conservatives who are careening to a Covid induced evolutionary dead end brought on by an inexplicable cognitive failure.  It is the only realistic explanation as to the medical madness we are witnessing that threatens to collapse our healthcare system where they’re beginning to turn away cancer patients from hospitals and there is the possibility of a new variant appearing that will pierce the vaccines protective wall wiping all of us out.

Most of the published trials were merely ""Hail Mary"" attempts to stem the virus, in poor countries with limited medical infrastructure.  The closest to a real trial, conducted in Egypt, showed structural and procedural flaws that completely invalidated the results.  (An uncharitable assessment might have included words like fraudulent.)

The ""value"" of Ivermectin against Covid19 can be summed up in the recent report of the ""anti-masker"", who contracted Covid, self-medicated with Ivermectin and, subsequently died.

The ""trumpian"" hydroxychloroquine farce caused a shortage of the drug for people with real conditions; the Ivermectin ""idiocy"" now seems to be adversely impacting innocent animals as well as people who really should know better."

Because the FDA and the Federal Trade Commission police ""advertising"" for false claims (medical or otherwise) and when found, stops the activity, and bring sanctions (sometimes aggressive sanctions in order to deter activity by others who might take note); then, why are these two entities not going after Fox News (with its massive viewership) for regularly promoting the use of Ivermectin? 

The Fox News promotion of Ivermectin occurs within its editorial content (it is promoted by its various on-air talent); and to the casual viewer this may not seem to be ""advertising"", however, modern advertising (i.e. ""native advertising"") many times takes the form (sometimes with much deception) of regular editorial content.  

And even if, for some reason, Fox News' ongoing promotion of Ivermectin does not rise to the legal threshold of ""native advertising"" are there no other public interest laws (where deception can result in public harm) that can be used to sanction and stop Fox News from manipulating and harming its viewers?"
2021-08-30 15:06:59,"I am not supporting ivermectin but the article fails to mention anything about how this situation developed.  It appears to have originated from a couple papers/preprints that claimed to show ivermectin was highly effective (ca. 90% in one paper) against Covid.  At least one of these papers, in The Journal of Antibiotics, is still easily found (Nature still provides it with the note  ""22 June 2021 Editor’s Note: Readers are alerted that the conclusions of this paper are subject to criticisms that are being considered by the editors and the publisher. A further editorial response will follow the resolution of these issues.""  

So the use of ivermectin didn't come out of the blue, as implied by this article, but from papers/preprints in the medical literature system.  The  preprint claiming 90% has been found to be both flawed statistically and with clear evidence of plagiarizing.  Once out there they become easy targets for conspiracy theorists:  a cheap drug is a miracle cure being kept from us by a corrupt medical elite.  If all you knew of was the claims made in these papers (and I doubt the retractions and flagging are discussed in the radical-right media) ivermectin would be on your radar."

While many of us have our experts whom we trust to give us solid information and advice, they have their own ""leaders"" on whom they rely--which is anyone who is strongly anti-intellectual, high risk-taking, and delights in flouting conventional, professional, and establishment thinking and norms. 

While we read science, reputable news sources, and listen to well-educated, experienced experts about how to deal with covid, they mimic this information-gathering process by ""reading"" their trusted sources on social media and the Internet and by listening to their trusted friends, family, and religious groups to arrive at the decisions that guide their choices and behavior. 

No wonder Fox and right-wing media have worked so hard (and successfully) to legitimize false equivalence. 

Contrary to what Daniel Moynihan said--that people are entitled to their opinions but not to their own facts--Fox, right-wing media, social media groups, and certain religious groups have successfully gotten across the notion that:  ""My opinions are just as good, even better, than your facts; and that makes me just as good as you, or even better.""

2021-08-30 14:58:41,"I'm a retired big-city newspaper reporter who's been studying the Ivermectin question. Last week I interviewed Hector Carvallo MD of Buenos Aires, who conducted the very first human tests of Ivermectin last year as a possible Covid prophylaxis and treatment. His trials were approved by his hospital's ethics board and the city health office, and his findings published in respected journals. The results were so overwhelmingly positive that they essentially launched what we might now call the Ivermectin movement. Since then there have been dozens of observational trials showing Ivermectin to be efficacious to some degree as both a prophylactic and a treatment for Covid-19, and safe at the efficacious doses. Several high-end metanalyses (viz. Lawrie, e.g.)  of these studies are also very affirmative. My point is that the case for Ivermectin as a Covid treatment is not nearly as nutty as this and many other recent news articles suggest. People should not be self-prescribing the veterinary versions of this drug, but my reporting strongly suggests Ivermectin warrants further study, including robust double-blind random control trials.

What a waste of resources having to debate such ignorance. Insulting. The entitlement of rejecting all medical advice and science and then coming to the hospital and expecting every effort be made by medical professionals to save you. Deep breaths. I geared up and went to see him. My compassion won out. I spent nearly an hour with him. So tenuous that shifting positions, attempting to talk or even swallow an ice chip caused dips in O2 levels and extended breaks to recover. He is afraid and uncomfortable and alone. I wish people could see this side of it. I explained my role and his status as best I could. I tried to encourage him. He was gracious and said thank you for all the information. Maybe I’m naive to think it will matter. That these moments of connection make a difference. That we aren’t so far gone on different paths to not even see the humanity in others.

Then, some would’ve come out and said that while the rich are being given the newest in vaccine innovation- the mRNA vaccine, which is “much safer than ivermectin”, the “rest of us are being given this cheap, second line choice, which has no evidence behind it”.

The only double blind, placebo controlled study I know of was in Columbia, and the preprint report was withdrawn due to 'ethical concerns"". But the FLCCC (a team of frontline doctors and research scientists) has posted the results of many other studies, in vivo observational studies mostly, showing great effectiveness. In Vitro studies also show its anti viral properties in the lab. And what I see in this comments section is misplaced partisan bias. Last year my 95 year old mother got Covid from her care giver, I showed the evidence to her doctor and he prescribed it. We used the FLCCC's protocol and she never suffered anything worse than a sore throat and some deep naps. She's been firing on all cylinders ever since.

Conclusions: 

Moderate-certainty evidence finds that large reductions in COVID-19 deaths are possible using ivermectin. Using ivermectin early in the clinical course may reduce numbers progressing to severe disease. The apparent safety and low cost suggest that ivermectin is likely to have a significant impact on the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic globally."

In the 10 months during which we were searching for a vaccine, the virus spread thru the population; you cannot vaccinate a country out of that situation.  Meanwhile, critical care doctors who specialize in fields such as cardiology and pulmonology were watching too many die.  So they pulled every rabbit out of every hat, trying desperately to save lives.  And happened upon Ivermectin.  And it worked clinically as part of a cocktail which includes other drugs and supplements.  And guess what?  Lives were saved.  But it won't make any big pharma a billion bucks, so it is dissed.   But the word is out and more doctors are willing to write it now.   Which is a huge relief.  It costs pennies yet it is a great anti-inflammatory with the added benefit of having anti-viral properties.  Take at home at first symptom with the supplements.  Don't wait for test results.  Start the protocol and chances are very high that recovery will be swift and complete.  AT HOME."

Furthermore, results from numerous controlled prophylaxis trials report significantly reduced risks of contracting COVID-19 with the regular use of ivermectin.""

Even so, it is the US that politicized this issue from the start. This started with the Trump administration but has continued with Biden. The US' absolute determination to pursue a new Cold War with China has meant that any opportunity to paint China in a bad light or cast aspersions on Chinese intentions is seized upon with an unseemly delight. China's amateurish and petulant responses are not helpful, but American aggression is difficult to miss - unless one is brainwashed into not seeing it. Knowing how this virus started is scientifically valuable but this issue has become too tainted by the political motivations of the parties involved for any honest assessment to be possible at this time. Right now, what matters is that the virus is out and it needs to be dealt with effectively. Whatever its origins, the virus has revealed very uncomfortable things about human societies. At this point, the most valuable lessons may be in learning what we can do better and why it is that so many people are so easily manipulated and misled by lies. If China is spreading its own misinformation, it is hardly alone."

But either way we need the unvarnished truth and must be ready to accept the facts, even if the conclusions contradict the prevailing opinions of our political tribes.

This despite millions of deaths worldwide from Covid. Not a puzzler anymore when you see worldwide many elderly died and that included many receiving pensions or other benefits from decades of working and contributing. Here in the United States alone there was an  additional increase of 400,000 deaths and people dropped from social security in 2020.  There was also a drop in the number of  applications for retirement since many in that age died.

The only scenario thunder which they are not responsible is a natural infection , which looks less likely over time, especially given the Chinese government response.

Tom Friedman, who were sure that by pumping our wealth into China, it would become a west-friendly, free society, and there would be an almost magical positive outcome via that astonishing transfer of wealth, resources and industrial capacity. 

It took the pandemic, but boosters of that theory have gone quiet. Still, the container ships of goods crossing the pacific continue unabated, and we get a decimated heartland and the rise of Trump, and the world gets turned upside down by COVID.  China’s early response to the disease, whether sinister or incompetent (clearly a mix of both) unleashed suffering and loss to every corner of the globe.

They gutted the soul from Hong Kong, are comitting the Uighur genocide, and finally are making people think Covid really was manmade by not letting anyone do the bare minimum research about it. 

I'm trying to find out how the current generation of children watching this unfold around the world won't end up being anti-China as adults, but I'm failing. It's ridiculous."
2021-08-25 12:30:40,"““The point is to really saturate the airwaves with all of this, which most average Chinese will not be able to see behind,”

2021-08-25 12:59:26,"That's odd, it was created here but the outbreak started in Wuhan. There is no further discussion needed at this time."
2021-08-25 12:08:53,"“…unnecessary horror to society.”

When a state has fully embraced the propaganda narrative ((as in tell the people what they want to hear rather than what’s actually happening) then the truth, when inconvenient, becomes such an unnecessary horror. Then pointing fingers and fake news become the face of the regime while the party apparatus attempts to deal with reality (disease) behind closed doors, using oppression and directives to herd the people where they want them to go. Eventually the divorce of state news from reality becomes obvious fiction (as in non-existent Swiss officials). Trump was going down that road like Xi is now. Propaganda will only get a society so far. Then leaders become sultans in harems of sycophants and the state an impenetrable bureaucracy with perpetuation of power the only real goal. These states always fail. This preventing unnecessary horror with lies and stories is the classic response of bureaucrats protecting their fief. By promoting this Xi has fallen into the trap that authoritarians seem unable to avoid. The soothing balm of propaganda and yes men telling them (and the people) what they want to hear."
2021-08-25 12:06:20,"Covid has been politicized from the get-go. Maybe in alternate universe mankind would have come together, beat it together, and created some trans-national mechanism to prevent it from happening. Alas, that is not to be and you can bet that this won't be the last pandemic."
2021-08-25 12:38:18,The narrative of the origin investigation has been shaped around politics and billed as potential “payback” time for China. No chance of this ever sees any kind of cooperation. Only way this works is for the deal to be run as a 100% “scientific discovery” mission and hopefully something more comes to light.
2021-08-25 12:47:56,A page right out of the Trump/Republican playbook.  Blame the other side for what you (maybe) guilty of.  They understand what (sadly) gains traction in this country.
2021-08-25 13:04:04,"That's rich. No doubt about it, the virus originated in China. Whether it escaped from a lab remains to be seen. The Chinese covered it up and can't be trusted with this or anything."
2021-08-25 13:11:38,"This issue was stiff-armed early by politicians in the US who inferred or said that “blaming China” was xenophobic. It’s a fact that China has stonewalled any investigation on these same grounds. Now, we may never get to the bottom of what happened."
2021-08-25 12:49:58,"The Chinese government is rarely willing to publicly address its own shortcomings, often preferring to redirect attention elsewhere and rally the country against a common enemy.  
   China peddles falsehoods that the virus came from elsewhere. Chinese  Scientists even released a paper positing that the pandemic could have started in India.
   Chinese would not allow the WHO to return to Wuhan for a thorough investigation. The WHO wanted to investigate that the hypothesis that the virus leaked from a lab in Wuhan. WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus proposed that the second stage of the agency’s investigation into the origins of coronavirus should include further studies in China as well as laboratory “audits” but china would not allow that. 
   Even Anthony Fauci said several weeks ago that he was “not convinced” the virus did not emerge from a lab in Wuhan and backed a further investigation. This is what he said: ""I am not convinced about that. I think that we should continue to investigate what went on in China until we find out to the best of our ability what happened,""."
2021-08-25 12:51:58,"Why would anyone expect anything different?  The Chinese government is a dictatorship and doesn't need to abide to anything that even remotely resembles the truth.  This comes from the fact that they, the Chinese government, is the controlling entity in that country and its citizens.
Here it is a different story.  Here the citizens are suppose to be in control, and this control is exacted through elections.
But a problem has arisen which needs to be fully acknowledged and vetted and accounted for.  The article states: ""Beijing is peddling groundless theories that the United States may be the true source of the coronavirus...""  How is this any different than when many in our government initiated the ""groundless theory"" that Mr. Trump was somehow colluding with Russia?  In this case, the groundless theory was thought up by people in our government and brought to the news media (very much including this very paper), who for years hammered into the public mind."
2021-08-25 13:18:29,"By not cooperating with the WHO's investigation into the origin of  the Covid virus and peddling conspiracy theories from the highest of government, China is playing a desperately losing game.  China's image and standing in the world have already suffered and sullied.  The average Chinese are perceived as uninformed, aggressively nationalistic.  Stereotyping is hard to shake it off."
2021-08-25 12:56:37,"China would be more impressive if it faced the reality that another pandemic will certainly develop in China in the not-too-distant future. 
That way, there might be some hope of international cooperation to help China stop it before it killed so many people - in China, not just outside China."
2021-08-25 13:26:17,"Of all the places in world, this pandemic originated in the one place that actively collects viruses from bats and studies them. There are no such things as coincidences. The possibility that this virus is a random occurrence in the same place that actively researches the same family of viruses is close to zero. This virus spilled out of the lab in Wuhan whether by accident or, by some malicious actor. 
The Chinese then hid this from the world until it could not and, by then it had already spread across the world. Rewriting history is what every authoritarian regime does.
At this time, it doesn’t matter unless the Chinese are holding onto information of the virus’s origins that would be useful in predicting its future path. Otherwise, the course remains the same, vaccinate, mask, socially distance,…"
2021-08-25 14:00:10,"Reading the comments is very disappointing. The lab leak theory is highly unlikely. A natural spillover event from China’s wildlife trade, farms, and unsanitary wet markets is a much more likely source. However, the lab leak is simple to understand, natural spillover is not. The world missed an opportunity to put pressure on China for their wildlife trade which not only harms biodiversity, but is also a source for novel viruses. Now we are trading conspiracy theories instead of addressing the real issues."
2021-08-25 13:58:44,"China is the enemy of the Free World. The sooner we understand this and respond as if life depends on it, the better off we’ll be. They mean business, and their goal is to replace the USA as the sole superpower and spread their authoritarian ways across the globe."
2021-08-25 14:12:57,"While I think the lab leak theory is unnecessary to account for the pandemic - leaping from bats to humans is sufficiently plausible - Using Occam's Razor (i.e. choose the simplest explanation). I am concerned about labs that deliberately study how to make a virus more dangerous. Either way, whether for malevolent reasons, or a desire to track and study viruses, it is a possibility a virus was released accidently. Seriously, what are the odds a viral outbreak starts near a virus laboratory. Occam's Razor is a suggestion, not a directive."
2021-08-25 14:06:24,"I am so tired of the endless China bashing that our government and media has engaged in. It is counterproductive at best and dangerous at worse. By focusing on scapegoating China, we have on both conscious and unconscious levels reinforced the perception of China as ""other"". I believe that this has been part of the reason that our response has been so delayed and inadequate. Remember the ""relief"" when this hit Italy because then we would get some ""real"" information and see how a modern Western nation could successfully deal with Covid without resorting to the ""draconian"", ""totalitarian"" and ""Maoist"" strategies employed by China. Then to our astonishment and horror, we saw this thing literally steamroll Italy. Oops. It really doesn't matter what China publicly said, they gave us a step by step playbook of how to handle this. What they did to contain and mitigate was literally visible by satellite and based on sound reasoning and science. If we did not see them as ""other"" we would have appreciated the severity of the threat sooner and would have followed their, now proven, strategies. We are blaming them for our own failures and continuing to do so will jeopardize the global cooperation that is required to deal with this and future pandemics."
2021-08-25 13:48:54,"@MCS - Your experience mirrors mine. I abhor Trump but I did not disagree on principle with every single syllable he uttered. However, any suggestion of agreement on such wildly dangerous ideas like getting Europeans to pay for their own defense instead of milching off the US, immediately made me unspeakable in the eyes of some. 
The fanaticism and religious self-righteousness of the left is something I've always found very frightening."
2021-08-25 13:57:57,"We do need to get to the root cause/mechanism of COVID-19 transition resulting in human infection. It is just possible that such information will help us prevent in future a more deadly and even more contagious virus or perhaps even the gamma, rho or tau variant of this virus.

I am just as greatly concerned about the other pandemic which has appeared concurrently with COVID:
disinformation. 
Propaganda has existed probably since the dawn of man but never has it been so widespread, all-consuming, effective and believed. This latest example of Chinese state-sponsored disinformation is a paradigm. The Chinese are able to preemptively drown out any opposing views. 
The same model is also effectively deployed by anti-vaxxers around the world with devastating results on infection rates and deaths. 
The world cannot unite to fight climate change as long as disinformation supports divisive conspiracy theories and mistrust of science.

Disinformation is the real existential threat to mankind and we are unlikely to find a vaccine to combat it."
2021-08-25 14:07:27,"China is following the US playbook.  Lie about everything, just like Trump, and now Biden also.  But we want those cheap Walmart towels and sheets, the cheap toothpaste and dogfood and baby formula even though it was a fact that they tried to poison us with those same products previously.  Because the big dollars rule."
2021-08-25 13:38:01,"I've read several articles on this subject, including in NYT. All of them spell out a long list of suspicious circumstances pointing to a lab leak in Wuhan, then conclude that the virus probably just jumped from animals naturally. Why?

While not proof, the fact that the initial outbreak and the infamous wet market were all within a few blocks of the lab that studies and modifies coronaviruses certainly seems like an astonishing coincidence."
2021-08-25 13:54:14,"China should face economic sanctions until they stop repeating these false stories about the virus. This issue, and their mistreatment of the Uyghurs, should cause the responsible countries of the world to quickly find a replacement for Beijing for the upcoming Winter Olympics."
2021-08-25 14:21:09,Both countries have the lab theory against each other? That’s what happened when we politicized a pandemic. Investigation of the origin is voluntary. Can’t expect China to corporate when we have been  demonizing them every way possible for the last few years.
2021-08-25 14:25:19,It seems as if NOW is the time to work together to control or stop the virus. Let’s spend our energy doing that rather than pointing fingers at who did it.
2021-08-25 14:25:56,"We may never know if the novel coronavirus leaked from a lab or from animal-to-human transmission from a wild animal at one of Wuhan's live animal markets, as the Chinese first suggested but that's exactly the knowledge we desperately need to prevent the next pandemic because the solutions are so different. 
  The Chinese government's control over its scientists makes it unlikely we will learn the truth now or ever. Many of China's top scientists today were educated in the West. These include George Gao, the head of China's Center for Disease Control and Prevention, who trained and taught at Oxford and Harvard, and Shi Zengli who directs the Center for Emerging Infectious Diseases at the Wuhan Institute of Virology and received her PhD in France.
  Chinese scientists are great scientists, but they work for an authoritarian government where politics, not facts, always come first. If the information they know or discover makes China look bad, it is dangerous to say it especially to foreign colleagues, especially publicly, and, often, even to their friends or family."
2021-08-25 14:29:53,"Personally, I don't think the origin ""matters"" as much as ensuring that lab safety is reviewed globally to prevent the chance of a viral escape happening in the future. 

That being said, I would have no problem with Fort Detrick being investigated if the CCP also agreed to allowing the Wuhan institute to be held to the same level of scrutiny."
2021-08-25 14:30:13,"The CCP’s propaganda efforts regarding the origins of Covid are mostly for internal consumption and part of a longer game internationally. China has been honing its propaganda to undermine its “enemies” and redirect attention away from its abuses both within China and without. They’re getting better at this and our counters are less than effective. For the world to address the origins of the pandemic and force the Chinese government to take responsibility requires an independent investigation and review, otherwise you end up with competing narratives that encourage distrust. The WHO would be the proper authority for such an investigation if they would stop deferring to the Chinese government and remain free of American interference. We need to have a better understanding of the origins of the pandemic, this will not be the last time a crisis of this magnitude happens. Overpopulation, resource depletion and climate change are going to exasperate the spread of especially virulent viruses, while the CCP deflects and denies any accountability and we use the pandemic to score political points and influence foreign policy the risks grow. No one “wins” a pandemic, especially when hubris and arrogance are involved. The Chinese people have just as much to lose as the rest of us, why doesn’t the CCP see that?"
2021-08-25 14:32:42,"The big problem is that nobody knows when and where the first case was detected.

China do not want to admit that they don't have a clue where it came from. So it is easier to do the blame game.


In China the first person with Covid19 was detected mid November 2019, but there are indications there might have been cases in October 2019.
Research in Italy show antibodies in blood back in September/October 2019.
Similar research in US show antibodies in blood back in mid December 2019.

When the shutdowns started around the world it was way to late.

This outbreak started in the worst time of the year, where it was expected higher number of the usual suspects like pneumonia and flu."
2021-08-25 14:33:22,"This is why we need more people to learn and master foreign languages. Communication will be a key battleground in the wars of the 21st century, and until we can speak the enemy’s language, we’ll always be behind on that front."
2021-08-25 14:35:10,"China had only a few covid cases this week? Impossible!

 One must question how does China, with it's astonishing 1.4 billion population, including a vast number in poor rural areas without access to health facilities, control the delta covid strain so incredibly efficiently? 
In Australia, we have around 1,000 new cases daily! How does Australia, a wealthy nation continent without shared borders, about the land size of China but with only 26 million people, with extreme lockdowns and curfews of about two thirds of its population who are much more compliant than most countries, have so many covid cases compared to China? Compare the numbers and China should be having 50,000 new cases daily!

I could be missing something, but I'm now sceptical about covid being an accident and China's not allowing a full investigation of covid origin only contributes to suspicion."
2021-08-25 14:41:24,"Tit for tat in lab escape theories of course only muddies the waters, already murky. Nobody seems to bring up a scenario whereby Chinese lab researchers contacted the virus while researching it in the market, and it spread  from them before they realized what was happening. That would explain Chinese stonewalling consistent with a market origin. It took many years of painstaking research to understand the ebola origin in Africa. We do at least have a pretty good idea of what to look for in the next pandemic, even if international cooperation to do something about it is sadly totally lacking, as it has been criminally dilatory in fighting this one."
2021-08-25 14:40:06,"Of course, this is retaliation for the unfounded lab leak theory.  Both these theories are equally unlikely when you realize, confirmed by a couple of different credible studies, that the virus, probably a more benign variant, was circulating in Europe and probably the U.S. months before the known outbreak in Wuhan.  The U.S. just keeps wanting to push the disinformation (propaganda) of the Chinese lab origin to discredit their greatest economic and global influence rival wherever they can.  

I'm an American but I am embarrassed by the unprofessional and unscientific distortion of Covid facts, including by the media.  China has no reason to cooperate and open its facilities to foreign scrutiny when it is clear that the U.S. would never allow the same."
2021-08-25 14:40:15,China lies in service of its goal to become the world’s sole superpower.  Does democracy stand for truth and solving problems? You can’t address a problem you don’t understand exists.  If we can’t agree on the need for and force a thorough investigation of what caused the biggest international catastrophe in our lifetimes… China has already taken control of us all.
2021-08-25 14:43:56,"To those who think ""it's not important"" to figure out the origins of the pandemic -- Fauci wants to expand gain of function research.  That's right, the very research that likely may have caused the pandemic, cost millions of lives, ruined economies, and put an entire planet in lockdown mode, could be expanding.  The question is, do you, as a taxpayer, want to fund this?  Gain of function research was controversial from the get-go.  This very newspaper ran an op-ed years ago decrying it for the risks.  The Obama administration banned it.  If the pandemic was in fact caused by gain of function research, the question is, should this research continue, or should we perhaps (as some scientists prefer) take a different route when it comes to anticipating/preparing for potential new viruses, like simply improving methods to monitor hotspots in southeast Asia and Africa?"
2021-08-25 14:16:44,"This reminds me of the conundrum that Sadam Husein found himself in before the Iraq invasion. If he came out and plainly stated he had no weapons of mass destruction Iran would have massed its tanks at his border, but if he admitted he had WMD the world would have invaded in an instant. China is in the same pickle. Supposing it did escape from their labs, they could never admit it, the world would never forgive them, so what's left to do? Deflect in the same way that Trump would tell the bigger lie. I've never been one for conspiracy theories but if China are now trying to pedal the line that the US is responsible for the Coronavirus, I sit up and wonder."
2021-08-25 14:55:54,We don't have the moral standing to go around pointing fingers.

2021-08-25 15:15:40,"Until there is regime change in the PRC, the full truth of Covid origins will never be known.

But that's decades away, if ever."
2021-08-25 15:16:02,"It's pretty clear to anyone who has been following the progress of The Pandemic that it originated in China, that China kept information of its existence to itself, and that China negligently failed to contain it. 

As such, if I suffered damage as a result of this virus, like losing someone or getting personally sick, or losing my livelihood, I would sue China for negligence in an American court for damages. 

When you get your verdict there are plenty of Chinese government assets here against which you can levy.

We should institute sweeping sactions that escale over time till it exceeds 100% in next two years.  Work with allies in South Asia to defnd against unjust Chinese claims of sea rights and defend Taiwan against micro-aggression.
In addition we should cut off Pakistan from all assistance; they ally closely with China and the Taliban.
We should demand our EU partners do the same as well."

2021-08-25 15:24:36,"As a biology investigator, I strongly and sincerely believe (conclude) that the lab-grown and cultivated Covid-19 virus came out of the lab, first infected and killed a large number of Chinese people, and spread to the rest of the world to infect and kill. Who is responsible for this? The answer is the Chinese government. Any other explanation is out of logic and rationale. Who is going to demand China to compensate the world for this man-made pandemic?"
2021-08-25 15:37:44,"But the US is promoting its conspiracy theory that the virus came out of the WVI, which is a scientific research facility on virus under CAS (Chinese Academy of Sciences), without an iota of evidence beyond rumors and innuendos.  What is startling to me is that some in the US with scientific background (like some in the Broad Institute) are peddling the conspiracy theory on the side.  If  the Covid virus had been modified and then leaked from a lab, like the US conspiracists have alleges, it would be much more likely from places like Fort Detrick, which is a Bio-weapon facility, than from WVI. The lab leak theory is really the product of the current political climate of Washington and the US, to blame China for everything that is going wrong in US and the world."
2021-08-25 15:09:07,"The New York Times has already reported that the government of China shut down its early warning system for respiratory ailments (established after the first SARS epidemic) when the first cases of what is now referred to as Covid-19 were detected in and around Wuhan. The big question is, why would the government of China shut down the very system it put in place for front-line medical professionals to report cases of a novel respiratory virus?"
2021-08-25 15:12:07,It started in China. Their attempt to hide it is not surprising.  Some of the comments here is a sad statement of how some Americans have a negative view of their country.
2021-08-25 15:20:16,"China has created an alternate universe and alienated the entire Western world.  This is just one more reason to wage a world war on china.  Notice that All the Western nations now have their navies in the Indo/Pacific region.

2021-08-25 15:55:12,"The regime's claims about Fort Detrick are to be expected, and they are certainly nothing new.  The Soviets back in the early 1980s claimed that the virus that causes AIDS was created at Fort Detrick.

What IS interesting is that the regime is using rap music to spread its message.

That tells me that Mr. Xi is worried about what his own population believes.

And that is significant, to say the least."

2021-08-25 15:43:46,There's no origin story that makes the Chinese look good. Arose in a wet market? Clean up that terrible cultural food supply system. Arose in a lab and escaped in an accident? Maybe China isn't ready for that intense a research facility. Arose in a lab and was set loose? Germ warfare is thoroughly frowned upon; makes you a world pariah. Any origin story at all also includes fear of loss of face and worse; information doesn't travel up when it results in oppression down.

2021-08-25 15:55:12,"Chinese state media is relentlessly anti-American and will seldom miss any opportunity to bash the US, so these kinds of allegations regarding Covid’s origins are tediously predictable.  And with China increasingly powerful and assertive on the global stage, their leaders are more willing than ever to risk offending the governments and citizens of foreign countries, as long as it plays well to their huge domestic audience, which these mistruths invariably do. 

The CCP has not only mastered the act of taming the Internet behind the ‘Great Firewall’ but also perfected the dissemination of disinformation to a more sophisticated level than any contemporary government. I have university-educated friends living in mainland China who genuinely believe that Covid’s most likely origin is the US and know far more about Fort Detrick than the Wuhan Institute of Virology, the world’s premier research centre of novel bat coronaviruses.

The CCP cover-up of Covid’s origins looks crude and unsophisticated to foreign observers, but for mainland China citizens, who know little or nothing about their government’s refusal to let WHO scientists access the raw data of early Covid cases in Wuhan, and are instead fed a constant stream of news stories (with misleading or cherry-picked information and quotes) on state TV and social media about how Covid almost certainly originated outside China, it’s highly and depressingly effective."
2021-08-25 15:51:07,"Quite frankly, if China is ramping up its disinformation campaign to spread conspiracy theories about the origin of the coronavirus, the US and our allies (hopefully we still have some) should use all available tools necessary at our disposal against China to counter.  

Sitting back, ignoring what China is promoting and doing nothing just emboldens China even more.  That’s what occurred in the intellectual property and trade area.

Apparently, China is using a playbook per the origins of the coronavirus similar to Russia disinformation and meddling in our elections, as well as Trump and the Republicans peddling baseless 2020 election claims of a “stolen election.”"
2021-08-25 16:09:22,"If the virus was created in some lab (be it China or the US), surely by now the bad actor would have erased any evidence that remains (including in any offsite backups).

2021-08-25 16:14:43,"If the virus originally escaped in America, as China asserts, cases would have exploded in America first because, as China again asserts, America is not very good at controlling the virus. But the virus clearly exploded first in China, which China asserts has done the best job of containing it. 

It does not really matter much whether it came from zoonotic crossover or an accidental lab leak. In either case interactions between humans and animals carrying potential crossover viruses, wet markets and labs all need to be better monitored, managed and controlled."

It all happened on his watch and he was ultimately responsible for protecting the American people based on his oath to office. His initial response was to keep the virus secret so not create panic in the stock market. Later on his denials and do-nothing policy from January to mid March to protect his re-election let this virus run amok in this country and allowed his hard-core constituents to adopt his denialism and mistrust of the science that has led us to this point of mass infections and unprecedented deaths. Even with his Operation Warp Speed getting the vaccines developed, his failure to develop any type of vaccine rollout plan beyond getting the vaccine from the Michigan plant was an utter failure. Trump then kept his own vaccination quiet for months and only recently urged his supporters to get the vaccine. Trump undermined the trust of his own supporters and now those who are unvaccinated are the large percentage of those dying from COVID in our over-run hospitals."

The Wuhan Institute and labs in Wuhan were conducting coronavirus research for well over a decade there, and no evidence has been shown that a wild animal is the host, or an intermediate host of sars2. WIV has the largest repository of viruses in Asia, and papers show they collected and experimented with novel coronaviruses at safety levels below what is recommended. Add to it China's massive disinformation campaign to point the finger at the West and suspicion is justifiable."

Not only are we light-years away from a global consensus, but thanks to our ever growing belief in abstruse fake news, China is the big winner amidst the confusion and is profiting on all fronts. The middle upper class in China is at the origin of the pandemic and China must be held responsible.

2021-08-25 16:19:17,"At this point, I would wager more than a small amount of money that the virus came from the Wuhan virology lab via an accidental infection. The evidence includes (1) The tremendous secrecy and uncooperativeness of China, including taking down the sequence data of the viruses they were growing. (2) Apparently, some of the sequences are remarkably similar to Covid19 virus. (3) Once detected, the virus has mutated remarkably slowly. If the virus was newly introduced to human cells (aka people), you would expect the virus to mutate very rapidly as it adapted to grow and infect humans. This did not occur. However, if the Chinese were growing the virus in human cells in the lab, it would have become humanized while being grown in these cells. Once passed to a human, many fewer mutations would be needed to make it a really effective pathogen. 

Of course, the ultimate source of this virus was some animal, probably a bat. In that sense, the Chinese are not lying when they say it came from an animal source. However, they are likely lying when they say the Wuhan was not involved in accidentally humanizing it and accidentally letting it loose."

Really, though, I have to ask how this helps us right now?  This is a fixation for the Fox News types that are denying COVID exists, but also accusing China of releasing the terrible calamity upon the world?

As far as I can see, those are the people that are causing the problem. COVID is the America Virus (more specifically, the Republican Virus), even more than the ""China Virus"", because of the warm welcome and good friends it found here in the Republican Party. 

We have about 5% of the world's population.  We have free, unfettered access to the best vaccines against COVID.  And we're still accounting for 1 in 4 new infections, largely because of the people levying accusations against China for a virus they believe is a hoax.

The West got stuck in a false dilemma: globalization vs isolationism. The true narrative, however, must be DEMOCRACY vs TOTALITARIANISM.

Look at what's going on in Britain, Europe, Australia, the USA. It doesn't take a 'stable genius' to see that China and Russia are in a joint venture to dismantle the West.

Western PUBLIC must open its eyes and wake up to the fact that we can't have it both ways: it's either cheap junk and gas from China and Russia, or freedom for us and our children, period!  We can't have our economies depend on totalitarian regimes, and be free in our democratic aspirations for the future.  Our experience of the last thirty plus years has proven this indisputably.

Read Churchill's timeless masterpiece called the ""Iron Curtain"" speech. It was true back then, and it is even more true today - the most effective Western foreign policy ever, and the ONLY TIME PROVEN WINNING RECIPE against totalitarianism, which China and Russia propagate worldwide:
""If the Western Democracies stand together in strict adherence to the principles of the United Nations Charter, their influence for furthering those principles will be immense and no one is likely to molest them. If however they become divided of falter in their duty and if these all-important years are allowed to slip away then indeed catastrophe may overwhelm us all.""  - Winston Churchill, 1946"

That’s a pity, as nobody really blames China for causing the pandemic, either. Officials there simply didn’t recognize the virus’s extreme potential for human-to-human transmission in time; the thing made it out of its animal host and on to Seattle in a matter of weeks. Most any other country would have failed to stop it as well.

Still, the affair revealed how oppression inheres in the one-party police state system even when this remains attentive to public health concerns, as we witnessed the unnecessary silencing of Dr. Li Wenliang and mourned his death from the virus then striking his patients down.

If I am not mistaken, SARS originated in China even though no one has been able to determine how it began even though they suspect transfer from bat to human. China did not go off the rails trying to prove that SARS did not ""begin"" in China.

Thanks to this wonderful ideological scapegoat, now we still have hundred thousands confirmed case and thousand deaths per day.

Don't forget, SARS in 2003 had spread in Canada, but US blocked the borders, and not a single American citizen lost his life.  What China has been doing is exactly following the textbook instruction of Western epidemic history. If Bush administration was able to prevent SARS from spreading in US, they had done what China has been doing right now; nobody protested then, but now every move to protect US citizens is politicized, including vaccinations.

Cases are spreading and the mood is that the their vaccine doesn't work, yet the government is wont to admit this.  IF the government had faith in their vaccine, the argument goes, they would (and could) easily require it but if they did and cases still increased, then the evidence of it's inefficacy would be irrefutable.  So after a huge initial vaccine rollout, lockdowns are nevertheless returning, stoking the conviction that the vaccines are pretty useless.  I'm told that masks are worn universally and willing by the public, but with cases rising and areas being shut down, there doesn't seem to be an imminent end to restrictions in China.  This is very sad indeed.  My view is that eventually the government will have no choice but to push OUR vaccines, and I'm told they've quietly started stocking up.  But blaming us?  SORRY BUT NO!"

2021-08-27 02:13:07,"No surprise. This corporate oriented majority on the SCOTUS again comes down against the decent emergency status of the struggling citizens in our Nation. This court needs reasonable expansion to get it to observe the law, not conservative objectives. Justice for All."
2021-08-27 02:15:37,"If I were Joe Biden, this is where I’d push back against the court.  I’d say that John Roberts made the ruling, so let him enforce it.  Because I’m not."
2021-08-27 02:27:29,"If you really wanted to prevent evictions, the simplest way of doing it would be to pay the landlords. I hear horror stories about small landlords who are still on the hook for mortgage and taxes but cannot get anything out of their renters, even though they may have the money to pay. How is it legal to tell people what the can, and cannot, do with their own property? If the government wants to be a landlord, it can build public housing. Otherwise, it is simply the expropriation of private property and we all know how it ends."
2021-08-27 02:32:53,"Remember the statistic where more than 50% of the pandemic-unemployed were making more than they did prior to the pandemic?  Why didn't they share some of that with their landlords?  It is akin to handing people food stamps but then telling them that actually, using them to pay for their groceries was optional and that the grocer would have no legal recourse if they took their groceries for free.  I am neither a renter nor a landlord but extending the eviction moratorium after the government aid began flowing was wrong."
2021-08-27 02:20:08,"People unable to pay rent will not be “forced to crowd in with relatives or seek refuge in homeless shelters, spreading the virus” because they can be vaccinated. Anyone over 12 can be vaccinated.

It may be wise and compassionate to suspend evictions due to economic hardship caused by the pandemic, but eviction does not have to pose a health risk. 

One can say, “what about this children!?”, but if the adults living with them are vaccinated, they are at incredibly low risk. Science."
2021-08-27 02:22:04,"You have to wonder about the partisan cruelty of the Trump Supreme Court.  We are in the middle of a global pandemic, and in some states, at the unprecedented height for the epidemic.  

The ""conservative"" justices once again have sided with bigotry and against the suffering of Americans.  Public health will be negatively impacted, and more people will die.

Where is the justice for poor people, for those who will now contract Covid, and who will suffer homelessness when the epidemic is spreading?  It will spread beyond the homeless population to the families crowding together in too small of spaces.  It will impact minorities especially.  The CDC has enormous powers from the beginning of the 20th century.

Now if only this was something to do with evangelical or dogmatic religion, this court would have said the Church could do whatever it wanted.

Their own Last Judgment may surprise some of these oh, so very pious black-robed justices with blood on their hands."

2021-08-27 02:26:52,Even President Biden acknowledged that his recent ruling extending the moratorium was illegal and would probably be overturned. Accusing the Supreme Court of 'cruelty' is pure sophistry.
2021-08-27 02:27:57,"It's pretty simple. If you want the relief money, mandatory vaccination. If you sit at home and are unvaccinated, you deserve what you get in being thrown out.

2021-08-27 02:30:13,"“It puts hundreds of thousands at risk of being put out of their homes.”  ￼￼-  

These homes aren’t THEIR homes.   They are renters not paying their rent.   They are being evicted so the real owners don’t lose their homes.   An important difference."
2021-08-27 02:18:56,"The CDC clearly overstepped its bounds. The fact that State and local governments are unable to disburse rental assistance due to their own iineptitude or incompetence does not mean that landlors are not entitled to their rent. The States and local governments still want their property taxes, the utility companies their usage charges and banks their mortgage payments. This has gone on way too long and even the Biden administration knew its position was most likely illegal. I doubt many landlorsd will ever get their back rent and few tenants will be thrown on the street especially in cities like NY and Chicago where a standard eviction take months if not years."
2021-08-27 02:25:34,"I agree with this ruling. Landlords, many of whom  owe mortgages themselves, can't pay them without rent. How long should they go without rental income? An eviction moratorium isn't a solution to anything."
2021-08-27 02:28:58,"The government should simply process payments due to landlords - at the same speed they're airlifting Afghans from Taliban war zone. This week it was reported that over 80% of these payments have not been processed. It's unfair to impose eviction moratorium on landlords who have mortgages and repair expenses to take care of, in addition to property taxes and insurance premiums."
2021-08-27 02:32:37,"If it is people vs. property, this court will always choose property. Always."
2021-08-27 02:15:54,"Rental agreements are between tenants and landlords, not tenants, landlords, and the government.  As the Court points out, fumigating contaminated items is one thing, but barring nonpaying tenants from being evicted is a far greater strain on credulity of the nexus between the eviction moratorium and any relation to interstate commerce, the Constitutional authority a limited federal government has to intervene in private contracts.  An administration that proclaims fealty to ""rule of law"" should never have gone there after narrowly surviving SCOTUS review in July: the ""double dare"" received the appropriate SCOTUS slapdown tonight."
2021-08-27 02:17:27,"On the one hand this show that when it comes to the government to give free money to business, it is all a success --billions were distributed to businesses worthy and needy, to those not so much. Yet when it comes to help families in America, Congress cannot be bothered to fix a program (why not distribute directly to landlords?) and Biden whimpers obsequiously to a Court that does believe that the Country is for those that own it.

On the other hand, as a Court decides that it is lords over all, from immigration to tenants to religion to education, without being elected and without being accountable to the People, and with two Justices of questionable character, a seat stolen by McConnell and another occupied in haste, the time might very well be here to reform the institution, either by packing it, or by making it an advisor with the Executive and the Legislative considering their opinions exactly as such."
2021-08-27 02:20:16,Just thinking about the idea of losing my housing paralyzes me with terrible fear (and I own my paid off house). Housing is a human right along with health care and education. When will we extend these protections to every single one of our citizens? We know how much money we burned in the forever wars. Why do we keep giving it to the military industrial complex? We need to come together. Now.
2021-08-27 02:25:07,"The Supreme Court opinion is worth a full read.  It's pretty clear the majority has it right on the law.

What's missing, though is any consequence for the Biden administration's clearly unlawful action.  

They extended the moratorium when there was no sound legal basis to do so.  They admitted they were just trying to buy time to distribute more aid while awaiting the inevitable court reversal.

In the context where most of us function (say a local decision by a planning board), this kind of extreme conduct would be met with sanctions from a court.

Why not here?  What deters any presidential administration from doing the same thing, all over again?

2021-08-27 02:40:20,"It's mixed messaging. On one account the economy is doing very well with unemployment returning to pre-pandemic levels, consumer spending at a high level as well as the GDP. What is the justification for the eviction moratorium on account of economics then?"
2021-08-27 02:41:26,"As sympathetic as I am to those who cannot afford to pay their rent, I don’t know how the government can simply force property owners to let people occupy their rental units for free. How is that different than the Quartering Act when Great Britain compelled American colonists to house British Soldiers? That’s why we have the Third Amendment. My hope is that landlords who are in a financial position to do so will cut deals and be charitable with good tenants on hard times, but you can’t force landlords to keep footing the bill indefinitely while also paying property taxes. It isn’t fair and I’m nit even certain it’s Constitutional."
2021-08-27 02:44:44,"I do know several people personally that are behind on rent and are truly struggling (although with jobs plentiful today there is certainly opportunity to dig out as a majority of companies have increased payrolls by more than 30% this calendar year alone - a significant contributor to the rising inflationary pressures), but what I witness at work on an almost daily basis is people who have not paid rent for months and in some cases, approaching years; with new cars, new boats and assorted new toys in houses and driveways  while not paying their landlords - and no I am not a landlord, and yes I am in their houses. I listen to their stories bragging about not paying rent and “making more” not working than they can make working - although most of them never worked pre-pandemic so it seems a bit of a spurious comment - and spending enhanced UI benefits and stimulus monies. Yes many of these tenants will be evicted. Yes many of them are a year or more behind on rent. Yes many of them chose not to pay because they could get away with it rather than try to pay or prioritize bills over “stuff”. I don’t know how to separate those truly in need from those who have belligerently abused a situation but I can comment on my very real, very observable direct experience and that is the large majority of renters I am situationally aware of who are behind on rent have made that choice at the exclusion of necessity rather than out of real necessity and it’s the landlords “paying” the price."
2021-08-27 02:20:24,"The Supreme Court making laws from the bench just like the Republicans have railed against. Wait, it is okay as the six ultra-ring Justices are in favor of minority rule to carry out their anti-democratic rules. The  60 years of backward thinking and rich over all is becoming true. Theocracy rule to have a Puritan America even though the majority in this country are opposed to it. Sad time for America and its future generations!!!"

After 4 years of Trump and the bloody denouement of 20 years of carnage caused by wars started without legally-mandated Congressional oversight, that well-meaning fools are still demanding for more, not less, action by fiat of an all-powerful executive in disregard of the law is absolutely bewildering. 

It doesn’t matter if you agree with what Biden was trying to accomplish. What matters is that he did it illegally. If we indulge him here, we can’t consistently oppose such dictat by those with whom we don’t agree later."
2021-08-27 02:38:26,Our Congress has failed us. Small wonder why people do not care to vote. Congress taking a break as the July 31 moratorium expired shows all you need to know about their regard for the working class

2021-08-27 02:37:00,"The executive branch knowingly tried to ignore the expressed intent of the Supreme Court.  Irrespective of your political affiliation, or your belief in the righteousness of the moratorium, we should all be against executive overreach. 

This was the only possible decision and an important guardrail protecting our republic. This time the guardrail held."
2021-08-27 02:43:39,"President Biden clearly understood his executive order would be overturned.  He was reluctant to issue it, in the first place.  But to placate some elements of the Democrat Party elected officials he reluctantly signed it."
2021-08-27 02:33:46,"Good!!! I am happy that the supreme court ruled in favor of the law and in favor of morality. The majority of the people who genuinely needed help will be helped by keeping in contact with their landlords and coming up with payment arrangements with the landlord and the state. This ruling doesn't mean that everyone will be evicted. 

What this ruling does is help landlords get rid of the deadbeats that have taken advantage of the system in which the landlord have very little legal recourse. I had an issue with these dead beats in which I suspect were dealing drugs because of the constant foot traffic at all hours of the day and night and the noise and disturbance that they would cause in my complex. Eventually it got so bad that the police were called in and I later found that that they had been illegally subleasing a room in my property without my knowledge and they were not paying me any of the the rent. Anyways despite the police report and and the nuisance caused it was still very hard to get rid of them due to this eviction moratorium and if I had taken the money from the state to cover their rent, I would have been obligated by law to to keep them as tenants until this pandemic was over. This was an absolute mess. 

I did find needles around my property and I did witness the tenants injecting themselves with some kind of drug confirming my suspicions later on. These are the type of people that are also protected by the eviction moratorium that deserve nothing."
2021-08-27 02:40:27,"The Supreme Court gave congress three months to act and they dithered. The Democrats had the votes and the Senate would have gone along with it. Republicans don't want to see millions of their supporters evicted. The court had no choice, giving the CDC such expansive powers subverted the very idea of direct regulation. Now, congress should cut short their vacation and act. If they wait until September as many as a million renters face eviction."
2021-08-27 02:42:02,"Once again, this far-right Supreme Court favors the wealthy. They may occasionally appear to “lean left” on culture issues like gay marriage. However, their pattern of putting corporations before people and rich people before poor people is unmistakable.

When you combine this with their diminution of voting rights, one must wonder when America passes the tipping point from democracy to oligarchy. We are very near it, if we haven’t already passed it."
2021-08-27 02:38:08,"This article says, more than once, that the root of the problem is ""Congress failed to act."" It would be much more accurate and informative to say ""The Republicans in the Senate prevented Congress from acting."" Let us please put the blame for the impending medical, economic, and human disaster where it belongs -- squarely on the Republican members of the Senate, who have once again ignored the will of the majority of Americans and thus impeded the democratic process."
2021-08-27 02:33:55,"This is the domestic analogue of the Afghan collapse. Without shame.

The essential issue is that as with Afghanistan, insufficient 
attention and energy  was paid to overcoming the in place bureaucratic obstacles that made any humane solution to an overwhelming human disaster impossible. 

This is exactly why people have no a priori reason for placing much, if any, trust in government, even when those with authority position themselves as being committed to acting  in the interests of those who are most vulnerable. 

You can blame SCOTUS all you want. That is almost too easy. 

But the main point is that the administration left too much discretionary and/or procedural authority  in the hands of state or local officials whose loyalties and interests need not sync with those who need this aid the most. 

Those with the greatest need are also in such desperate
states that it is impossible for them to follow the rules
and regulations put up by local authorities. It is an
absurd and profoundly  immoral situation. 

Much like that which put up absurd obstacle courses for
desperate Afghans who thought that by helping this country
in the past they would be favored to flee here when the inevitable taliban victory arrived. 

And we like to think we're a compassionate society....bah humbug."
2021-08-27 02:38:01,"The 6-3 majority is now free to run wild, and run wild they are. The obvious juxtaposition of the rulings, upholding Trump's ""remain in Mexico,"" against a new administration who in theory have the same powers as the previous administration and the ability to amend or overturn such orders, with this ruling where they overturn the  emergency authority to protect hundreds of thousands from homelessness and pandemics during this very trying time, shows an incongruity and that this is now an outcome-based court. The rule of law, the separation of powers, the proper role of executive authority- none of these matter anymore. Just wait until next year, as we look at ""Roe v. Wade,"" the lawful application of restrictions on guns, and who knows what else will land on their agenda- executive powers, state based discrimination, voting rights, etc. We will see a truly frightening historic shift in our laws and our checks and balances. 

Perhaps the most destructive element of this newly empowered majority running roughshod over causes they oppose, while upholding the ends they support, is that the last remaining societal foundation of trust in our Supreme Court as an institution grounded in the rule of law will be shredded. I actually feel for the landlords, and they deserve Congressional and legislative help. But that is up to Congress and legislatures, and they have taken those steps, albeit implementing them in a clumsy fashion.   We are on a dark and dangerous path."
2021-08-27 02:46:41,"the comments miss the point of the ruling. The issue us not about whether the moratorium is good or bad; reasonable or unreasonable, it wis about the way the entire thing was handled. once again, the justices are saying that Congress needs to create legislation. the conservative justices are correct but Congress is completely broken. Nonetheless, the ruling is correct."

“I hope to live to see the day when you become president,” Elder emailed Miller in 2016. “Your kind words are heartening beyond measure,” Miller responded, calling him “the one true guide I’ve always had.”
Elder also mentored Breitbart’s editor-in-chief Alex Marlow, who kept a copy of Elder’s book “The Ten Things You Can’t Say in America” in his backpack as a high school student at Harvard-Westlake. “It was loaded with facts I could use when I found myself debating people,” Marlow told me recently.

It is just another free money handout to the democratic base that needs a long-term solution.  

Biden's crew knew the new moratorium wouldn't fly... it just gave everyone another month of rent on the taxpayer's dime while it worked its way through the courts  --- until we learn how to spend the housing dime smartly, free money is just a temporary fix that mean a lot of people on the street come Thanksgiving."

The Court said: ““It is indisputable that the public has a strong interest in combating the spread of the Covid-19 Delta variant,” the opinion said. “But our system does not permit agencies to act unlawfully even in pursuit of desirable ends.” Yet, when it comes to this issue, it is executive agency of the Governor against an agency of the County.

2021-08-27 03:31:48,The Supreme Court has not put hundred of thousands at risk of eviction. Congress has done that by not passing appropriate legislation. The Supreme Court interprets the law as legislated by Congress. It does not make law.
2021-08-27 03:34:50,"Cori Bush's statement that the Supreme Court failed to protect households seems particularly out of place. That's not the Supreme Court's job; that's Congress's job. Have we so lost our way with how American civics works that we can't even hold the correct people accountable? If Congress were a functioning governmental body, this wouldn't even be an issue. Let's not encourage autocracy or oligarchy rather than focus on putting moderates in Congress.

Also, there's nothing cut or dry about this issue. The effects on middle-class landlords - many of whom have mortgages to pay in addition to maintenance expenses - being unable to collect rent, evict, or sell are nothing to sneeze at. A steal-from-the-rich policy sounds fun, but the reality is that it's just propagating financial collapse. Congress needs to enact both relief and eviction moratoria in order to keep people housed and homeowners afloat."
2021-08-27 03:08:33,"I see both sides. Tenants who misspent their unemployment and stimulus money on flat screen TVs should not be allowed to short their landlords.  

Others should work with their landlords to get them paid. 

Landlords have bills to pay and should get relief."

This problem is complex. Landlords have rights and tenants are human beings. No easy answers, but this is heartless and cruel. A few more months wouldn’t have hurt and by then, maybe some of the relief funds would have made its way into the accounts it was meant to reach."

2021-08-27 03:27:10,"This should never have been a moratorium, it should’ve been a freeze. Freeze the rent and mortgages and if that doesn’t work longterm then send money to homeowners and renters. Moratorium is a cruel joke. Nobody who missed payments for a year or more is now going to be able to pay that back plus current rent/mort. Beyond just housing, consider small business. A restaurant is never paying back the rent that’s 12 months behind while paying current rent on top. But Bezos is doing just fine! The American way?

To recover & continue this American experiment we are going to have to force the representative government to pass a universal basic income and health care for all. Anything short of that and America continues its unraveling."
2021-08-27 03:31:46,This id good news for landlords especially those with a couple of three properties owned to make a better life willing to take risk capital.

2021-08-27 03:37:23,87% of relief funds approved and allocated months ago have yet to be distributed. Landlords and property owners have fixed costs for which they are receiving no relief. The court has simply said that further relief must come via Congress not decree (no matter how lofty the ideal). Seems pretty sober/reasonable particularly with a robust job market and lackluster performance by Federal government in providing the assistance where it is most needed.
2021-08-27 03:38:34,"Breyer’ s dissent suggests that he actually agreed that the 1944 law could not be employed to prevent evictions. In suggesting that the issue required full briefing, he, too, appears to have been trying to buy time, suggesting that, recognizing the public health crisis, the Court should delay evictions for an additional few months by hearing the full case. 

In other words, the Biden order was a Hail Mary, and Breyer had urged the Court to keep the ball in the air, regardless of the fact that it would probably not make it to the end zone. The real solution is Congressional action; and that is what must come next. To mix sports metaphors - the ball is now in the Democrats’ court."
2021-08-27 03:43:26,"This is the right decision.  If the government wants to provide gratis housing by paying for it that is one thing.  What we have here is a demand on landlords without compensation. At least that is how it has worked out.

The better thing to do is for the government to hand out money to people that cover their rent and quit trying to reactivating rent moratorium.  If people want to pay rent with the money super, they live wherever on the government dollars.  If they want to spend the money elsewhere also fine.

And what one of the previous posters said is also correct...landlords should have been able to fill for at least partial restitution for lost rents so they didn't go belly up or lose their savings too."
2021-08-27 03:51:04,"Depends on whether you follow the letter of the law or the spirit of the law. 

The spirit of the law would include the suffering mass evictions during a pandemic would cause. The moratorium on evictions was not unconstitutional, but it was time limited. If landlords were getting financial help they wouldn't be forced into a position where eviction is necessary. 

Had our government helped the landlords this could have been avoided. Now, landlords will evict. Those evicted will have evictions on their credit reports making future renting difficult. 

Landlords will have vacant rental units and few to rent them to - it's a lose lose situation for landlords and renters. 

And, that's without considering where those who are evicted will go. There aren't enough shelters and few options."

Something is very bizarre here.  We’re supposed to believe that $46.5 BILLION is not enough to stop most if not all evictions?  And people wonder why no one trusts anyone in government.  Why hasn’t it all been distributed?  Simple, it doesn’t,  and never existed.  Or it “went” to the multimillionaires and billionaires who get everything.

2021-08-27 03:53:49,"The eviction moratorium was alway unconstitutional, and bad public policy to boot.  Landlords are not to blame for government inability to pass out money - why put landlords who rent to the poor out of business?

2021-08-27 04:05:16,"If anything shows the incompetence and right wing rigidity of the Supreme Court this current position against the moratorium on eviction most certainly does.  

We are living in a pandemic where it is horrifyingly becoming
increasingly clear there might not be an end in sight for a very,
very long time.  In this new go-around with the Delta strain the 
virus' power is giving us a powerful message that we must
use everything in our power to prevent new strains from
emerging which is more likely to happen when more people become sick and harbor the virus.

The Supreme Court rigidly refuses to accept the fact that anything we can do to prevent the spread of the virus is a public health necessity.  Having many people evicted will give the virus what it needs to spread because more people will shelter together by necessity.  The Supreme Court's decision is aiding the virus and this is easily the most destructive decision the Supreme Court has ever made.  

It falls into the category of the old doctor joke that the operation was a success but the patient died. It is also akin to telling
children to go play in traffic, except that in the case of the
virus, the Supreme Court is sending thousands to go play in
the intensive care unit.

We need to repair the structure of the Supreme Court so that
it isn't a place where doddering right wing foggies spend their
last days because they're killing us."

Small landlords who worked very hard to buy rental property were forced to bear the cost of maintaining the property and financing Covid housing. Particularly with the inept handling of rent relief, this ""eviction moratorium"" was an unconstitutional deprivation of property from day one."
2021-08-27 04:19:51,"This was the correct decision.

Landlords not only need to pay the mortgage. They pay insurance, property taxes, and utilities (the cost of water, gas, and electricity have increased sharply in my state and will continue to increase). They are obligated to keep their properties in habitable condiiton. When the roof leaks, or a water heater goes out, or the toilet needs a plumber, they pay for those repairs.

Small landlords assume considerable risk to keep their properties. Most are not eligible for unemployment. If we earned more than $75K in 2019, we did not receive stimulus checks. Some have not received any rental income for 18 months or more. 

No other industry has been forced to continue providing services while foregoing income."

2021-08-27 04:26:04,I must be missing something. A landlord evicts a non-paying tenant to rent to a paying tenant. So the evicted tenant is disadvantaged while the new tenant benefits. It sure seems like a wash when it comes to COVID risk. For each tenant who is harmed there is one who benefits.
2021-08-27 04:30:24,"In our city, many landlords who owned maybe one or two modest rental houses just gave up and sold them to be torn down by developers.

2021-08-27 04:39:16,"I am troubled by the summary way the Court handled this. I do not see the need for Congressional pre-authorization of the executive branch taking of a landlord's property.

The Constitution prohibits the forced boarding of troops, but not forced boarding in general. I would see these issues briefed and argued before deciding the case."

Furthermore, even the Congress' earlier moratorium is questionable in light of the Fifth Amendment's just compensation clause -- the correct method would've been to pay the landlords and then require them to not evict tenants. 

Aside from legalese, looking at this the moral way, it's high time we stopped free rent and free extra unemployment -- there are nearly 11 million jobs unfilled, which is by far a record in American history.

You'd have to ask them where that money went.  Social welfare can be a moral hazard because in cases like this, many of these people have depended on government support and believed that the Democrats would wipe away their rent bills.  The AOC's of the world offered them hope for that pipedream, and now you have millions of people who, thanks to being enabled to dig their holes deeper and deeper by these endless eviction moratoriums, are now on the street with a bill for 18 months of rent they legally owe.  Even worse, their credit is in shambles and only the most dilapidated properties will give them a lease now.  This is yet another example of a Democratic social policy that backfires in the long term.  And to top it all off, it is dubious that this eviction moratorium had any appreciable effect on containing the coronavirus.  The CDC did not even want to extend it but the Biden administration strong armed them to placate its progressive wing."

Here in Australia, and elsewhere, there were no ‘eviction moratoriums’ because laid off workers were given financial support to see them through.

And of course, that lack of social welfare comes down to the inhumane ideology of many Americans and the decrepit system of governance that blocks any change to that.

If Landlords had been given the same so that Landlords can stop paying their Mortgage, Property Insurance, Utilities, Property Taxes, etc. we would at least come closer to a fairer remedy.

The remedy that was eventually put forth, payment for the back and future rents owed by the tenant to the LandLord has been so incompetently done, that the only way to force Government to begin to correct such incompetence, is to end the Moratorium after a reasonable period. 18 Months of such Moratorium, even the Renters will agree, is UNREASONABLE if there has been ZERO support given to Landlords.

The only people who are to blame for the Ending of the Moratorium are the incompetent Government bodies that failed to act. This is really the only way to remedy the situation and make Government act in any competent way."

Never in American history has more money been given to people without strings attached.  In haste, a vast majority of the money has been wasted.  

People choose which bills they pay in any given month.  Since Covid, rent or mortgage payments were dead last.  The retired and subsidized all received more money than before the pandemic.  How many people really needed additional benefits to maintain their stats quo?  Surely not the millions that are behind in rent now. 

The reason it is hard to identify the people who needed additional help, is because far to many people were relying on still another check. Rent checks.  They were sort of promised, if qualified.

Stimulus checks should have given to people to meet shortfalls, not as a raise.  Congress should have known without strings attached, people would abuse the system.  Will everyone who didn’t pay their rent get more money that those who did? If so, why shouldn’t everyone get another check?"

The Democrats should expand the Supreme Court and appoint many more progressive judges to the Federal bench to balance the courts so that they more accurately reflect the views and legal perspectives of the majority of Americans."
2021-08-27 06:38:07,"""Hey, sometimes millions of people need to be put out on the street"", said the Supreme Court.

I have sympathy for both sides in this, renters and landlords. But who in their right mind thought that if people couldn't pay a months rent, that letting their debt accumulate for year was some kind of solution? All it did was create a massive pile of unpayable and unsustainable debt.

The reality is that in a capitalist society such as ours the high cost of living is a problem without a solution.

Or is it?

If people realized how expensive homelessness is on the rest of society, even the capitalists might start to rethink. We know for example that the uninsured, particularly before the advent of the ACA, put a tremendous burden on the tax payers due to the incredible costs associated with emergency care.

I believe there was one study which showed that there was a single homeless man in California who ended up costing tax payers over a million dollars because of all the uninsured emergency care he had received.

I also think that many Republicans today would rather continue that practice, rather than give in to what they would consider ""letting someone off the hook"" for their personal lack of responsibility, by giving homeless people a minimum standard of living. And the fact that the richest of them pay next to nothing in taxes would only bolster notion.

Of course, we've seen again and again recently that their idea of responsibility only applies to others - never themselves."

2021-08-27 07:22:27,The problem with the moratorium was that the buck stopped with the landlords and didn’t include the banks for whom there was no moratorium on foreclosures or on the collection of real estate taxes. Why should the landlords get caught in the middle?
2021-08-27 05:52:39,"The end result of this will be skyrocketing rents. Less mom/pop rentals. And renters at the mercy of a corporation. The Seattle city council  has (in only two years), wiped out the rental market and gave it to the corporations, under the guise of ""helping"" section 8 renters.  One property management company says 40% of their clients have quit and sold their rental properties. All scooped up by corporations."
2021-08-27 07:58:21,"As an eviction defense attorney for the neediest, most vulnerable among us, experience shows that at very least, there should be a moratorium against no cause and nonpayment cases. In the former situations, the tenant ostensibly has not breached rules or otherwise threatened the health and safety of other tenants, and in the latter, federal money exists through rental assistance programs to help make the landlord whole. It’s not just tenants’ lives at stake - where study upon study show the lasting deleterious effects of eviction on every aspect of a person’s life - it’s also the public’s, particularly in places with obscenely low vaccination rates. Congress needs to act promptly to fill the  dangerous void left by the high court’s latest ruling."

2021-08-27 07:25:25,"It's a hard situation. It's true that if the government was going to let folks off the hook for rent, they should have re-imbursed the landlords at least partially.

There could have been a better solution. Covid funds could have been earmarked for rent and expenses only. There are many public and privately funded programs that screen applicants and when money is awarded, the orgs pay the rent and bills directly, instead of handing cash over to the tenants. Meanwhile there should have been ways for landlords to recoup some of their losses as well. Those kinds of solutions should have been explored.

This thing is dragging on and on. Covid may be with us for long time, with people needing booster shots (like for the flu) every year. 

It's true that you can't just extend the moratorium indefinitely, and this day had to come eventually. 

But it sure could have been managed much better. Get ready for more homeless and desperate people, because that's the inevitable result of all this."

2021-08-27 08:26:14,"It looks like the state and local governments who failed to distribute the aid money in a timely manner is most to blame.  

In terms of the Supreme Court’s decision, it looks like the majority took an overly narrow view of the law, not surprisingly.  They failed to take into account that if an evicted person dies, that person’s life cannot be replaced, but if a landlord does not get rent paid on time, the landlord can still be compensated later and be made whole."
2021-08-27 06:37:07,"It seems all the Justices and most people view property rights as obvious and well-founded, but other rights like equal access to health care or jobs as unfounded. This is simply an accident of history where landed classes wrote the laws. 

Similarly the President’s power to unilaterally start and prosecute wars is viewed as obvious (notwithstanding the War Powers act), while the CDC’s power to protect public health is magically limited to “things like” quarantines. This is because modern European have had hundreds of years of wars of conquest, redrawing maps at will. It’s beyond obvious that public health is more essential to government than conquest, as Afghanistan, Syria, Iraq, and Vietnam have shown. 

But even this perspective won’t change the statutory interpretation at issue here. (The CDC’s enabling text would have been nice to read.)    Democracy is in real danger if it can’t evolve as fast as life does. It appears to be trapped in the 16th century."
2021-08-27 08:29:58,"My friend is one of thousands whose unemployment benefits will stop in a week or so. For months, she wondered why she was still living- ""What was the point when she was invisible, unvalued, and insignificant in society?"" she would say.  To me, she is not. I see her and I value you her to no end. She is significant to many in her community. Without her friendship, my experience from Feb. 2020 to now would have been much more challenging while being voluntarily ""caught"" in another country that was supposed to be a temporary stay but which has since become my home because of the pandemic.  Despite all of her challenges, she helped me by being a good friend. Throughout these past months, I never knew if she would, one day, find a way to gracefully leave this life. She has fought to maintain her grace and for the first time in two years, I'm hopeful that she will pull through. Being faced with eviction if she can't pay her rent would add another layer of trauma during horrible period. My hope is that we can pool our intellectual and creative resources to find solutions for a problematic system that we've created, a system that needs to be morphed by humanitarian motives to address the unique needs of people who simply need a home, especially now."
2021-08-27 05:42:54,"The reason the CDC imposed the eviction moratorium is that the U.S. does not have enough emergency housing to house the existing homeless, let alone a large influx of newly homeless people. If the two trillion dollars spent on the war in Afghanistan (not counting interest) had been spent on emergency housing, imagine how much housing we could have built! By my calculations, if it costs $50,000 to build a house (maybe it is a mobile home, or a multi-family building), we could have built 20 million homes for what we have spent in Afghanistan. That might make a big dent in homelessness, and give us safe places to put evicted people during a pandemic."
2021-08-27 06:57:19,"When I was in my early 20s, I was homeless. For two years. I lived out of my car, and for most of that time, I held down a job. Slowly, things got better. That was a long time ago. In all those years since, I never owned a home, but never missed a monthly rent payment, either. Since the pandemic began, I've been able to still work and slowly draw down from my savings - to keep making rent, and pay all my bills on time. (Contrary to many folks who earn a lot more than me, I have zero debt. And I realize how very lucky I am. Lately I've been thinking about so many folks who don't have *any* savings at all.) But I don't have a limitless savings account. And so, this is *the first time, in all these years* that I'm actually scared that I'll soon be homeless again. I think the pandemic has really been a mirror for each of us to hold up to ourself, and to see how we really treat one another. This also includes the six Supreme Court justices who decided to end this eviction moratorium. They've probably never been homeless, but the other three judges likely haven't been either - the point being, you don't need to have ever lived out on the street (or in your vehicle) to realize that now, thousands and thousands of people (and little kids!) will be homeless for the very first time. It's an awful experience. I know. You never forget the indignities and the shame and the crushing sadness and the lingering wonder if you'll ever have a safe place to sleep again."
2021-08-27 05:49:28,"I know people are whining about the ""evil"" Supreme Court, but Congress could have extended the moratorium. It did not. After 16 months, when does it end?

2021-08-27 06:50:50,"“It would be strange to hold that the government may combat infection by prohibiting the tenant from leaving his home,” its brief said, “but not by prohibiting the landlord from throwing him out.”

2021-08-27 07:50:14,"The next crisis will be about homeless Americans who were evicted during a pandemic.

For many of us in the tech world, we’re enduring endless rounds of interviews and being offered lower salaries than the pre-COVID economy yet we’re expected to have Tom Brady like resumes. 

The situation doesn’t need to be binary, which is the default position many Americans take. A solution that recognizes the need of both tenants and landlords is required to make this work. The alternative is mass chaos of those whose lives are being further ruined by the pandemic and the profiteering corporations who say they can’t find workers but who, in reality, just don’t want to hire anyone — especially those of us with advanced degrees over the age of 40 (52, in my case)."

Sorry folks but the possibility of 11,000,000 evictions is a frightening event. And these renters are not rich.
This is a monumental failure due to the polarisation in American politics. Without legislation to protect renters and landlords monetarily - meaning we the taxpayer pick up the bill - this is a human catastrophe.

The lazy and ill prepared government should have set up a way for tenants and landlords to sign paperwork that allowed money to go directly to the landlords in the first place, which is exactly how it happens with section 8 housing.

Pelosi & Schumer bear the blame here, not Kavanaugh.  Kavanaugh said very clearly the last time the moratorium came to the SC that it was indeed illegal, but he would vote to keep it in place since it would expire in a month anyway.  That is a strange argument for a Justice to make - if an action is illegal, it needs to stop immediately, not be allowed to ""play itself out.""  If he had instead struck down the moratorium, Congress would have felt compelled to act and might have reinstated it immediately.  That would have been the right thing to do, across the board.

Not surprisingly, the DC Government didn’t set up an effective assistance program until this summer because they could. The DC Council could procrastinate because they relied on their own more harsh moratorium that shut down the courts for all eviction actions even to actions based on tenants bad behavior. I am an attorney and represent several multi-family property management companies. The lengthy moratorium only caused complacency. Landlords in Virginia have been required to tell tenants in writing about the availability of payment plans, rental assistance programs and of their rights under the CDC moratorium. I have witnessed many times tenants who did not apply for assistance until they were deep into the eviction process despite having known about assistance programs since last fall. Once tenants do apply for assistance the courts will continue the eviction action in order to allow enough time for the tenant’s assistance application to be processed.

2021-08-27 11:06:58,The pandemic could go on for another year or more.  How is it legal to take money from one group of people (landlords) to help another (tenants) indefinitely? It would be one thing if the Government actually had paid the landlords during this time . . . but they haven't done so in fact.
2021-08-27 10:36:26,"The majority’s reasoning is of course technically correct, but in broader terms, it seems that our country and its legal system are slaves to an ancient document. The Constitution is not a suicide pact."
2021-08-27 11:13:00,"Let's keep in mind that Congress has not authorized this continuing rent moratorium.  Had they done so, there may have been a different outcome at the Supreme Court."
2021-08-27 10:48:40,"Shrug. Pay the landlords the rent owed to them. No one opens a business to have it taken away. 

The problem is that as things stand now, the government is depending on tenants to fill out paperwork, which they have no incentive to do since they cannot be evicted and which they are not doing. 

If we want tenants to get a free ride, then the money should be funneled directly to landlords."
2021-08-27 10:16:11,"The ""Party of Life"" and the conservative Supreme Court they bought shows that 1200 dead every day is not enough to give the president emergency powers that affect the pocketbooks of the landlord class. All of this could have been avoided if we had prioritized the health and safety of the people of this country above investment assets for a few months early on."
2021-08-27 10:57:51,"There will be pressure from progressives to bring Congress back to pass an eviction moratorium, although it stands no chance in a 50-50 Senate."
2021-08-27 10:30:16,"Capitalism wins, and the American Dream dies. A truly decadent decision. There are fewer and fewer homeowners in this country as properties are bought up by banks and others as the rentier class grows. Flipping and speculation are contributing to a crisis of homelessness and an ideological crush of greed, callousness and stupidity—all during a pandemic."
2021-08-27 11:23:25,"Why was this not accompanied by a moratorium on mortgage payments from landlords to banks?

Oh I know.  The banking industry is among those who own our government.  

But it seems to me that after bailing them out for crashing the economy, primarily over housing yet, they somehow could have helped the taxpayers who helped them."
2021-08-27 10:49:04,"You have to pay for what you use otherwise you can't use it. Housing is not a public good. The CDC can't make landlords provide housing for free any more than the FTC can make clothing retailers give away their products.

It's worrisome that people like Representative Bush and  supporters can't see past simpleminded ""Evictions are bad for me therefore they should be illegal"" reasoning.

If you don't want to pay to live in my home, that is your right. But you don't have the right to force me to let you stay without paying. How did ""Pay your bills"" become a political statement?"
2021-08-27 11:17:56,"“It puts hundreds of thousands at risk of being put out of their homes.” Or, hundreds of thousands of tenants now have to pay their rent."
2021-08-27 10:52:48,Evicting someone who can't pay rent is no guarantee a new renter will move in.  All probability is the landlord will continue to lose money.  In this case evicting someone is simply cruelty.
2021-08-27 11:23:52,"This article shows that Biden, Democrats, blue state governors and legislators and even the preponderance of Supreme Court justices (of course Alito not included) have hearts and an awareness that we are in an unusual time where people need help and time. On the flip side Republicans just hate people and want to put a hurting on them. Can’t work because of COVID? Too bad your out! The head of the realtors association. Isn’t he so worried about our national debt! He just wants to kick his own renters out. It’s give me my money but get out. Why is our nation saddled with such awful selfish people!"
2021-08-27 11:15:56,"This is the right call. The Supreme Court said weeks ago that Congress needed to act in order to continue the moratorium. It didn’t, so now the eviction moratorium has expired.

The Supreme Court’s job isn’t to look out for the public good—it’s to determine whether the government’s laws and actions are constitutional.

People should reserve their anger for their state governments, which have spent only a tiny fraction of the billions of dollars allocated for rent relief. Another couple of weeks wasn’t going to move the needle much re: this incompetent dispersal of funds."
2021-08-27 10:42:53,"thank goodness
without this ruling the government power to control our lives would have been dramatically expanded.
They came for the landlords and nobody said, a word and next they come for you?    What if they deem your product or service offering essential?
  They can take away your income by insisting you give it away for free?

WIthouit this ruling, potential landlords were greatly discouraged from investing in new housing.  Why take the risk when scammers can just decide not to pay rent forever?
  The eviction moratorium enabled massive rent fraud;  why pay rent if they can't do anything was a common refrain on social media.   If the Biden team had merely insisted on the tenant showing hardship, that would have at least been reasonable.
The job market is tight;  those that can't afford to pay rent, go get a job.   Jobs are plentiful, nobody is applying.  Facts matter.   
  We have paid people not to work with massive transfers, ie stimmy checks.   We have told people they don't really owe their rent.  We have massively encouraged couch living rather than normal adulting, jobs and responsibility.
  Thank goodness this part is ending"
2021-08-27 11:21:28,"This is another crucial step in the Sanders Agenda.  America can de facto  create free housing for its citizens by making eviction illegal, particularly at the state and local level if the feds won't cooperate.   And the banks who hold the mortgages will be in essence taxed to provide free housing, forever, as there is always a rationale to ban evictions.  I am confused how Justice Roberts could flip his vote on the issue???"
2021-08-27 10:44:14,The three liberal judges want to change who has authority to do what just based on a national emergency. If you allow any agency to go beyond what they are authorized to do just once you open up anyone in the executive branch agencies to making legislative rulings that are the constitutional responsibility of Congress.
2021-08-27 10:41:37,"The moratorium was never intended to prevent landlords from collecting rent. There's $47 million that will go directly to the landlords as the states process the claims.

So the Supreme Court thinks that collecting rent a bit sooner is more important than families with children, the elderly, etc. being thrown on the streets in the middle of a surging Delta Variant pandemic which will up the death toll? And causing them to lose all their property? 

Do the justices responsible for this travesty have no shame?  I wish them the worst that life could ever bring them as well as the callous and greedy Republicans who are in lockstep behind them."
2021-08-27 11:15:50,"Horrible.
First of all, landlords ARE getting paid. The rent relief aid is doling out funds to them for unpaid rent so i dont see why they are fussing. Landlords seem to want their cashflow to be the same as prepandemic levels without care or worry of the service that they provide which is housing. If they are to be as corrupt and greedy then maybe communism or socialism is key to snatch their properties for the welfare of the public and to keep the people housed in emergency situations which will only be more and more prevalent in the future what with climate change and more unprecedented catastrophic chaos."
2021-08-27 11:12:07,"Maybe it’s time for the landlords to go get real jobs like the rest of us.  Why should I have sympathy for someone’s loss of passive income?  Sure, the laws and mores of our society allow and even encourage the accumulation and control of excessive essential resources, but that still doesn’t make it the right way to act in regards to human dignity.

I’m going to say this so simply, it’s almost biblical: if you have two houses, and your neighbor has none, you are a bad person."
2021-08-27 10:19:31,"The Supreme Court is a sad joke, they are no longer neutral adjudicators of the law, but are a political apparatus.  The solution is to prove its broken, Roe v Wade is the most upfront reason that the GOP broke the court, so appoint a crazy number of abortion supporters to the court, say 305 abortion supporting gun hating under 30 year old women then watch the right scream.  The problem for them is they broke it they should suffer from the death throes of a pointless institution, law has no politics but the Supreme Court has."
2021-08-27 11:21:08,Of course the judicial activist court and its right wing supporters don't have to worry. Evicted persons living on the street or scrambling to keep children safe and fed and protected from the catastrophic climate disruptions don't vote. They are too busy surviving. The court and its majority won't have to worry about them so they can now can put more energy making sure that those more fortunate can't vote by instigating more draconian voting laws on the state level.
2021-08-27 11:13:11,"I'm a Democrat and agree with this decision but blame the states for not getting the available money to landlords. My guess is there are many, many thousands of people renting out one house and depend on that money for retirement and are on the verge of losing everything because some lazy degenerate is taking advantage of the system and has been for the last 18 months. All landlords aren't rich."
2021-08-27 11:38:15,"100% agree with the SC decision to end the eviction moratorium.

People on both sides of the divide for years have been complaining about legislating from the bench. Well, this shows exactly how the SC should be exercising its authority by checking the overreach in the executive branch and by clearing handing this to the legislative branch for action - or inaction. 

If this moratorium so vital - which it actually is not at this juncture - then Congress should pass a moratorium. The fact that this may take time and is highly contentious and will likely not pass is exactly why this doesn't reside with the CDC to be over reaching by imposing this moratorium."
2021-08-27 11:43:37,"As a small business owner I'm in an unique (unwanted) position: I don't qualify for unemployment, cannot use any of the small business payroll relief to pay myself & never received any stimulus checks. I haven't taken a paycheck in 18 months & counting. But here's the thing: if I cannot support myself--if I'm forced to close my business because no one is forgiving or delaying my debt--then a few dozen people lose their jobs. The government doesn't seem to understand--or care to understand--this very simple equation. 

Landlords are in the same boat as small business owners like myself. It doesn't take a genius to realize you can't create a program that only helps one half of the landlord-tenant relationship. Doing so has just shifted debt instability from the tenant to those who own the buildings they live in. And no one is forgiving the landlords's debt. If landlords can't pay their bills their tenants are at risk of eviction. If small business owners can't pay theirs their employees are at risk of losing their jobs. The government is long overdue in recognizing this."
2021-08-27 11:32:12,"Yes, there are people who abuse the system.   It has been that way forever.   I find it despicable, however, that we have a Supreme Court that seems to be on a mindless junket of taking care of those who do not need ""care"".   I understand there  are approximately 15 states who have not dispersed even 5% of funds to help. Even the Times stated that a couple of days ago.  "" About 89% of Rental Assistance Funds Have Not Been Distributed, ... to about $5.1 billion, figures released early Wednesday showed"".  Alabama is one of those states.   As for Kavenaugh, we will probably never find out who bailed him out....but you know, he conveniently never did answer where he got his ""assistance.""  Rich people get help.   Conservative courts like rich people."

2021-08-27 11:35:30,Maybe landlords should get a job and work like everyone else if all their income is passive and comes from rentals?
2021-08-27 11:37:51,"I'm heartened to read the most ""recommended"" comments here so far, backing up the Court's decision in this case.  My heart goes out to all of those who are facing eviction for their inability to pay rent.  And I'm hardly a fan of landlords, who have share a terrible reputation in most respects for a reason.  But one government agency can't be allowed to dictate in an arena where they have no jurisdiction.  You don't need to be a lawyer to know that.  This is a real conundrum which has everything and nothing to do with Covid. We've had a housing crisis in this country for as long as I can remember.  We bail out banks after they sell mortgages that should be illegal, we give developers tax breaks for putting up housing that does nothing to help those with limited income/means.  Yet Congress can't seem to get their acts together, yet again, to help the vast majority out there.  Bravo, Cori Bush.  Where are the rest of your counterparts?  Living mostly in fat cat houses in gated communities with second and third homes elsewhere.  DISGUSTING"
2021-08-27 11:28:29,"The government should be able to mandate the distribution of state-held funds to landlords and tenants who qualify before eviction takes place. This was the intent of Congress, and it is stronger tan the eviction moratorium.
It is inexcusable that state bureaucracies and more especially, their contractors, have held these funds up so long as to make them useless and invalidate the will of Congress. I am surprised there is no suit before SCOTUS about this, and that the Court did not have to take into account the clear intent of Congress in this."
2021-08-27 11:30:13,What the Supreme Court did was protect private property rights from government takeover.   Thank goodness we have those Trump nominees on the court
2021-08-27 11:43:22,"A first year law student could see the CDC’s orders on eviction stays are unconstitutional. Unfortunately The NY Times and other media ignore the obvious.  While there has been one conservative justice added to the Supreme Court in place of Justice Ginsburg, the media calls this decision by the Conservative court, but it was not called that when it made its decisions ( rightly so) blocking many of Trump’s unconstitutional actions."
2021-08-27 11:40:26,"I can't believe how long this moratorium has been going on. So, we should just let renters not pay their their rent indefinitely to landlords who also have bills to pay, when there has been plenty of time to find other means or other housing options. This is exactly the kind of ""socialism"" that fuels the Republican narrative."
2021-08-27 11:41:52,"I am mystified as to why the states haven’t done a better job getting money to landlord/tenants. Yes, they have to make sure there isn’t wholesale fraud as there was with unemployment and the PPP. But surely they could have done better than this?

All I can hope is that landlords know which side their bread is buttered on and, if an application for rent relief has been made, hang on and wait to get their back rent. Tenants, hope you’re doing a good job communicating with your landlord."
2021-08-27 11:50:06,Maybe the “hundreds of thousands “ should take one of the 9 million open jobs.  And there was no moratorium on property taxes.
2021-08-27 11:48:53,"Tom in NH posted the following while I was making coffee just now: ""CDC really should have applied a more nuanced approach to the housing crisis"".  Wow!  Tom hit that nail exactly on its head.  Our CDC has been up to things in recent months that could not fairly be called nuanced -- so much of its verbiage and actions have sadly been wishy-washy, touchy-feely in an amateurish way, or ill-crafted, illogical, and beyond the scope of advising the Federal government.  CDC's bailiwick does not include directly crafting policy.  Period."
2021-08-27 12:05:43,"Why does everything have to all or nothing?  Dial back the moratorium and require tenants to work.  Even out here in sticks there are help wanted signs on most businesses, so work is available.  Not the greatest gigs, but people can earn money. Lots of people work 2 or 3 part time jobs to get by. And there are plenty of jobs that don’t require a lot of skills.  

Then make sure landlords are getting at least a portion of their rent. If it leaves workers without a lot left, so be it, but people should not be able to live for free indefinitely.  And landlords who have been enjoying passive income may need to work. Not what they planned, but life goes on.  

The CDC overstepped, but so is SCOTUS.  The problem requires a multipart solution, not more mandates."
2021-08-27 12:27:51,"It should have been perfectly clear to our elected legislators that this sort of measure should have come from Congress. So if the position of the Democratic Party is that the this sort of bail out is still needed, they should have instigated appropriate legislation vs spending their time ransoming the infrastructure bill to pass their other huge funding measure 

I would also have to agree that landlords have not received a moratorium on their debt payments and also that at least some of those impacted probably could find employment. 

In any case the funding should go directly to the landlords in this case, not to the tenants in question. That seems fair and appropriate."
2021-08-27 12:28:00,"This highlights once again that Congress doesn't do it's job.  Congressional action (the people's house) is needed, not executive active.  Congressional inaction is the root cause of Executive overreach and Supreme Court having to make an unnecessary decision.  Vote in people that will take action and not shrink from responsibility."

2021-08-27 11:58:32,"I’m sure there are cases where people had a tough time paying their rent but with the supplemental unemployment benefits this has gone on way too long. A lot of small landlords were stuck with the bill. 

The progressive agenda which seems to want to turn this into a welfare state where everyone is a victim and there’s zero personal responsibility. This was the right call. I wish the Democrats would get it together soon because it’s looking like we’re heading to another gop sweep in 24."
2021-08-27 12:10:57,The economy is back.  I can’t find people to work.  How long can we make landlords sit and eat their bills with no recourse?
2021-08-27 12:18:21,Baffling that the Biden/CDC was able to extend the moratorium to begin with.  The Supreme Court did the right thing. This was overreach by the government pure and simple.
2021-08-27 12:02:00,The twice-impeached monster who pretended to be a president for four years must be thrilled with this decision.

I feel sorry sorry for Kagan, Sotomayer and Breyer that they have to serve with the rest of them."
2021-08-27 12:10:59,"I have heard hundreds of stories of self-righteous landlords slow-walking or out-right rejecting money from tenets who use the government funding, either because they want to raise rents and the tenet still has time on their lease, or because they feel since the tenet was temporarily behind on their payments due to the pandemic that they can never be trusted again.

To do this in the middle of such economic hardship is absolutely depraved. Landlords should get real jobs, instead of sitting around collecting exorbitant rent checks and creating artificial scarcity on a basic human need to line their own pocket. I don't care if you make yourself feel better by ""doing your own repairs"", if you want people to like you for doing that, go be a carpenter. But the rest of America is finally waking up to the sick nature of this business."

Simplistic nonsense and bombastic rhetoric rules the day and much of the comments. What we aren’t talking about is the failure of the government to provide pandemic relief in a way that protects both the landlords and the tenants. But that’s too complicated and it takes people to administer complex government programs. So no the government isn’t coming to take your property away and no not all landlords are greedy scoundrels. We have been in a housing crisis for years, long before the pandemic arrived. People need housing, working class families need housing, minimum wage employees need housing. We need to get past the simplistic narratives and bombastic rhetoric to find solutions, yesterday. And a final word for my fellow liberals / progressives, I live in a “liberal” community (Ann Arbor Michigan) and we don’t do affordable housing any better than “conservative” communities. We just like to pretend we do."
2021-08-27 12:48:24,"I have to admit that this is the correct decision. 

Landlords have bills to pay too. If tenants are to be forgiven rent payments, then the government needs to make those payments on their behalf so that landlords can pay their bills. 

The proper way to do this is through legislation, not through bureaucratic fiat."
2021-08-27 12:22:45,"The comments for this article certainly speak to your reader demographic, the majority of whom seem to have been inconvenienced by this pandemic and are tired of hearing that the past eighteen months have all but destroyed the lives of others."
2021-08-27 12:05:56,"The government had no right to force landlords to provide free housing to tenants - even during a pandemic.  And, the government so botched the distribution of relief aid.  It was a disaster from the start. There are Help Wanted signs up everywhere.  Funny how we're not out of the pandemic by a long shot but businesses are up and running - and the economy is booming.  Time to say no to those milking the system and stop putting landlords in harms way on their mortgages, insurance, maintenance, and taxes.  it's going to be ugly for a while but it is always hard to overcome stupid."
2021-08-27 12:05:15,It's not as if the democrats have a majority in Congress. Oh wait!
2021-08-27 12:12:46,"The court's common sense ruling affirms the simple fact that no government entity can force a property owner to provide free housing. Homeowners, even owners of 1-family homes like myself, should be rejoicing today. Its up to congress now, but any law they write must adhere to the very clear Constitutional provisions protecting private property rights, otherwise the SC will toss it too.

You think the liberals are howling today, just wait till the SC dismantles NYS's and NYC's renter protection and rent stabilization laws. Both are 'takings'."
2021-08-27 12:15:00,"In recent decades landlords have been hiding their identity by listing under multiple bogus owners or LLCs. This was to protect them from responsibily for the condition of their properties or the behavior of their tenants.  Good luck trying to find out who owns that abandoned property, the apartment building in disrepair or the large home rented out to party goers. So who gets the rent relief check? Will these landlords now have to reveal their identity to the government?

Deed information can't even be used because there has been  growing corruption and deed fraud by scam artists with government offices illegally transferring ownership without required proof.  Getting money to legitimate landlords is going to be a nightmare rife with fraud. Officials don't want to admit this publicly because they have ignored  complaints for so long.  

It is a widespread problem in the United States and why a lot of rent relief has not been paid. Who do they pay ? These LLCs are going to submit multiple requests under multiple names for multiple properties.This was not meant to be a bailout for speculators who took risks gobbling up multiple properties or empty office buildings meant for corporations, but it may turn into that.

 Legitimate owners with one home and  tenants are going to be left out and that is what politicians fear. They are paralyzed with trying to figure out how to make sure the money goes to legitimate home owners and and is limited in how much each landlord can collect."

2021-08-27 13:14:17,"If you believe in the rule of law, then this was the only possible decision.  

I don't even understand how the 3 dissenters conceive of the rule of law if the CDC or any other federal government agency can promulgate unprecedented, nationwide, sweeping restrictions of this magnitude and severity with no clear statutory authority.

And this is not even addressing the obvious Constitutional issues even if Congress passed a law giving the CDC power to regulate local landlord-tenant evictions.  Obvious Covid is a serious crisis, but we should recall States have plenary power and can address landlord-tenant issues as their residents see fit."
2021-08-27 13:14:55,"To those familiar with constitutional law, it's clear that not only did a regulatory authority exceed the scope of its power, but that this was essentially an unconstitutional taking of property by government, in violation of the 5th Amendment.

Congress should have enacted further legislation to enable the CDC to issue the moratorium. Regulators cannot exceed the scope of the statute under which they regulate. It's a very simple concept.

The easiest way, and what should have been done at the outset of the pandemic, is to freeze all rent and mortgage payments and have the government ensure the lenders won't collapse due to the massive drop in revenue. It's much easier to deal with a handful of banks than to try to issue funds to the millions of landlords and tenants (as we've seen in every single state).

Not to mention, as a lawyer, I have seen colleagues dealing with countless cases where the tenant has outright stated they are not paying, not because they were affected by the pandemic, but because they didn't have to. It's *possible* to evict people in that circumstance, but it is exceedingly difficult and expensive."
2021-08-27 13:16:08,"The moratorium has gone on too long, penalizing small landlords who can't even get a  court hearing for tenants who won't pay even though they aren't affected by the epidemic. But what communities are going to do with those who can't afford housing is a serious, moral issue. While we were all watching the prices of homes go up, tenants were watching the cost of rent skyrocket. There isn't enough affordable housing anywhere and we need to do something about it."
2021-08-27 12:27:47,"If the US government and society really wanted to address this they would not have put the solution on the backs of landlords. Yes, if you are a renter and can’t pay because of COVID-19, you shouldn’t have to end up on the streets. But don’t expect landlords to pick up the tab. One more example of a government that can’t do anything right."
2021-08-27 12:40:48,"This would all be moot if corrupt local governments hadn't allowed these landlords, often LLCs or foreign entities, to get sweetheart deals such as tax abatements  on properties and then raise rents to outlandish prices. People were having diffculties paying rent before the pandemic and that included people making decent salaries. 

It's slowed down a bit but even during the pandemic we get offers for our home so they can build multiple dwellings and charge thousands per month. This is not going to end well for anyone but the crash was coming even before the pandemic. The system was never sustainable with such high rent prices and inequality.

2021-08-27 12:50:23,"How is it that the same  government that has paid  hotels to house the homeless has not  paid the rent to landlords?

The government paid BOUTIQUE hotels in Manhattan to house the homeless , yet  has not paid landlords.

I am reminded of the government bailouts to banks and corporations. 

The banks and corporations were ""too big to fail"" and were bailed out despite having been at fault. 

I owned G.M. stock and bonds. G.M. was ""too big to fail.""
I was ""too small"" to be of any consequence.  What difference did it make  that I had done nothing wrong,   lost my money ,and the income on which  had been depending ? 

What difference did it make that any number of retirees lost their principal  and  income  ? We were ""too small"" to save. 

The same is true of landlords.  Mom and Pop landlords
are ""too small to save."" Never mind if they are bankrupted  and lose their own homes.  

The government should have paid the landlords directly from  Day 1, just as it paid Hilton,  Marriot and every other hotel."
2021-08-27 12:50:39,How about people just pay what their bills I’m getting no break on my property taxes because God forbid I fail to fund the city’s coffers but it’s ok for the government to demand that  landlords not receive what is owed to them
2021-08-27 12:50:43,Do you only like the rule of law when it breaks in your favor?  The Court gave fair warning on this. No surprise here. Biden knew it would not pass muster. We cannot empower agencies to make laws. They do enough of that already. There is no law preventing government from helping renters yet only a fraction of the relief money as been disbursed. Why? Why put the burden on the court to uphold an agency taking on legislative duties? That's the job of Congress but we know they will do nothing so it is incumbent upon the administration to solve the problem in other ways such as paying the landlords directly. Get the relief disbursed!

No one in my family has had a problem staying employed or going back to their temporarily closed office because they have been treated like valued workers. 

Most work completely or paritally from home.  One  does work that can only be done in person but her employer put in new filters in their two buildings, ran a clean facility before the pandemic, required vaccination for all employees months ago, mandates the wearing of masks and gives each employees a covid care package every month that includes hand sanitizers and masks.

Just raising a salary isn't enough. Many employers are not sanitizing or protecting their workers and people just can't afford to get sick becuae of our archaic health system. Then there are the many caregivers who can't return to work because schools are in shambles and kids are geting sick. 

Try thinking outside your own comfort zone just for once. Everyday I think how we have been blessed but still try to prepare for what may come and feel for those who are struggling. It is bad out there and people who worked hard for decades are having trouble.  Even if people had unemployment many were stuck with no longer having health coverage and had to pay out of pocket. There are many scenarios for why people couldn't pay rent and those with true hardships should be given help."

Clearly the SCOTUS has signaled it would look more favorably at a moratorium on evictions if it were authorized by Congress. That pesky law making branch of the government that seems to get in the way so often. But more importantly, if the argument doesn't pass constitutional muster, the cause dies. The better solution is for states and the feds to expedite support to those who need it."

The court is not there to protect your own personal conception of ""rights."" 
Action in erasing gains made in securing all rights is happening not in the US Supreme Court, but in your statehouse and in government agencies.
All that SCOTUS can do is decide, if they even take the case in the first place, whether or not what a state legislature or agency did is constitutional. 
They don't decide if the law is good or bad. 
They don't decide is a law is popular or unpopular.
They don't decide if the law is right or wrong. 
They don't decide if the law is needed or not needed.
They don't decide if the law is fair or unfair. 
They only decide if it is constitutional or not.

My issue can be summed up in a sentence:  how would the Court majority have ruled if Trump were the president instead of Biden?  Unfortunately, I have a feeling that the Court would have ruled the other way.  

The Supreme Court has not always met the standard of being unbiased and apolitical.  But it has gotten a lot closer than any other branch of government.  What is tragic to me is that the conservatives on the Court have given up even trying to appear unbiased and judicial.  The majority is now composed of knee-jerk right wingers and Republican party hacks with no independent thoughts at all.  It's very sad."
2021-08-27 13:15:37,The harm to landlords was incredible. There were plenty of people who took advantage of the law and just decided that they woudl not go back to work and pay the rent.

I think it is time we finished the southern border wall and stopped illegal aliens from crossing into our country at will and without going through proper channels. It is costing us billions of taxpayer dollars each and every day. President Biden simply is not up to the job. It is becoming very embarrassing as well as dangerous with the withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan and his TV performances showing just how incompetent he is.

2021-08-27 13:20:19,"This was a massive own-goal by Biden and congressional Democrats.

They had around a month to push for an extension in Congress, which would've actually stuck...but instead, they dithered on it until the last second. Then the White House hastily extended it to quell a political firestorm--in a way that ensured the conservative SC would strike it down.

It would be one thing if the Dems had immediately pressed the issue in Congress and it failed because of Republican opposition. But their lack of urgency on even trying to help tenants is their fault and theirs alone.

This is why people don't trust them."
2021-08-27 13:17:36,"I feel badly for everyone affected by this but it could have been avoided. The Democrats hold majorities in both houses of Congress and the Presidency so why wasn't this addressed on a timely basis. Why? It is the function of the Supreme Court to interpret the law not to legislate. With the possibility of eviction now facing many renters, the President needs to get Congress back to Washington to fix this. Will it happen? I'm not too optimistic. Perhaps if they didn't waste a lot of time on their political circus, Trump's second impeachment, and focused on the problems of their constituents, this would have been avoided."

We make the mess bigger the longer it goes on in its current form.  Wipe the slate clean for renters to salvage their credit, make the landlords whole, and get the units back on the market.  It will be expensive but not as expensive as continuing on the path we were on."

This should have been a program you had to apply for and provide proof you could no longer afford rent at which point your landlord would get part or all of the rent each month from the government until the emergency was over. 

Instead we just let people sign a piece of paper saying ""affected by COVID, can't pay"" and left the landlords hanging while tenants who were actually making MORE on Unemployment lived rent deferred running up a bill they would never be able to settle.

A single mother of three pre COVID with a menial job was making $25,000 a year and with the help of food stamps and other welfare programs was able to make rent and feed her kids.

Unemployed with the extended extra Federal UE benefits, various stimulus checks, etc. she is making $42,000 a year, still receiving the same welfare benefits with food stamps actually increased and yet... ""Can't Pay Rent, COVID"". 

The sad fact is most of these people now in dire straights skipped rent not because they needed to but because the could.

2021-08-27 13:31:42,"Equal offenders on both sides I am afraid-landlords are a mix of good and honest along with bad and corrupt.  Tenants are both well-intentioned to meet their contractual obligation under the lease and abusing their rights.  In this case, too many are using the pandemic ""relief"" to avoid rent, and using their stimy checks to gamble on Robin Hood or buy new laptops.
But this moratorium, and the FHFA relief for mortgage payments has to end.  Too many (not only democrats) beginning to fall under the ""moral hazard"" of thinking banks and landlords just sprinkle some magic dust and create money in their accounts, and think somehow having shelter is something that should be provided to them.  Not even China does that.
I feel for tenants who were legitimately harmed by COVID, but time is up, if you have to, you can get work.  I feel for those private landlords who own a property or two that rightly provides shelter for renters and income for them.
I have no sympathy for corporate renters who abuse tenants and fail to hold reserves against risks.  And for those tenants who will simply move out before they are evicted and move in somewhere else, after skipping rent despite having the means to pay it."

2021-08-27 14:09:32,"Obviously, this is anecdotal.  But, I'm an attorney.  I have done housing court work for both landlords and tenants.  

Ending up on the wrong end of a non-payment eviction action is a common side effect of job loss.  That said, the non-payment cases I handled rarely ended up in actual evictions.  In most cases, landlords were willing to accept reduced rent - - with a right to collect all rent owed under the lease at a later date - - during a period of unemployment.  

The reason for this?  Unemployed tenants receive unemployment insurance compensation benefits.  Pre-pandemic, unemployment paid less than a paycheck.  But, its statutory and public policy purpose was to prevent financial calamity after job loss.  In other words, unemployment is supposed to help you keep your head above water bills-wise.

So, with the unemployed receiving enhanced benefits during the pandemic, why wasn't any of that money used to pay rent?  There was nothing to do and nothing non-essential to spend money on for over a year.  There is a serious gap in discussing this issue."
2021-08-27 14:13:04,"This may be an unpopular opinion, but I am going to voice it anyhow. The term 'Landlord' has all too often become demonised. I am a landlord, I'm a Brit, and as part of my retirement planning I own a couple of properties that I rent out. I provide the opportunity for people who cannot afford to buy their own house or apartment to live in decent, well-maintained premises. A considerable proportion of my retirement income comes from this, and if my tenants can neither pay nor be evicted then it's hard times for me. I am sure that there are many such people as I in the US. Why should their needs, their income, their financial security not be considered as part of the equation? Why the tendency to always cry for the tenant and not the person whose income is hit by non-payment?"

And don’t forget the Supreme Court is beyond recall or reproach no matter how unjust or loathsome their rulings, Plessy v Ferguson, Dred Scott v Sandford, Citizens United v FEC, DC v Heller.

This isn't about border walls or aliens. This is about the danger of making our own citizens homeless. I am a homeowner and a landlord, and am worried about how I will keep the roof of the heads of everyone who lives on my well-maintained, single property home.

While displacement is awful, embedded in the article is the statement that hundreds of thousands are significantly behind on their rent.  And likely water.  And electricity, and so on.

The other side of the coin is that landlords are not in the business of being philanthropic, and without income, their debt service and maintenance and all the other things they do are put on hold, also.

This is a terrible situation, but without some sort of rent from occupants, they become squatters.  

The question is, how many of these are put into this position with the corona virus problem, and how many are in that position due to no jobs, job skills, change in (non-infective) health and so on.  I realize there is no way to get a handle on this, since neither is anyone going to canvass all these people, nor can anyone verify an honest answer is given.

Not all landlords are Trmpf and associated with suitcases full of money.  There are a lot of single and small number of units owned by hardworking citizens who were able to run a few homes or multi family units in their communities.

This is a big problem.  If there were an easy answer (other than mandating that owners cannot evict those living on their property for free) someone would have discovered it.

Already we have seen states not spend Federal money for extended unemployment benefits because it was allowing people to become lazy and wants to force people back to work. It seems almighty profits of landlords are more important then the public health-care when there are public funds available to subsidize landlords.

Right now our economic system works only for shareholders and CEOs. It doesn’t work for landlords, small business owners, local governments, etc.

These tax write-offs are not damaged at all. The right to sell the property is not damaged at all. On balance the holding of ""irreparable harm"" is an oxymoron.
The ruling is just another example of the Court radically acting outside its realm, and as unelected judges, and  interfering in normal executive functions. In the case of  the ""Congress could act"" dicta,  it is an insult to intelligence to think that Congress could do anything in this divided Country at this time.

2.  Taper the quantitative easing.  The Fed is purchasing $120 billion a month of Treasuries and MBS - this needs to stop as it is escalating property values and thus  inflating rents

The vast majority of this aid is going to the blue states and their metros, so what's stopping the Dems from handing out the cash? Landlords aren't the bad guys here, they rely on their properties to generate cash so they can live just like everyone else; so why is it that they have to suffer at the hands of those who can't or won't pay their rent?  Why not send the government subsidized rent payments directly to the landlords?  The Democrats have told the people that they are here to save the day but ultimately very little has changed.  They've gotten the ball halfway down court and stopped.  Then they feel that it's perfectly permissible for a bureaucratic agency, the C.D.C., to essentially make and enforce moratorium law without regard that the agency has no legal basis or authority to do so.   Taking such a case before the Supreme Court is a waste of time and serves as nothing more than bad political theatre.  The Biden administration is not leading as much as they are shape shifting."

2021-08-27 14:29:17,"Currently, millions of dollars sit unused in states across the country that were allocated in the last Covid relief bill for this very purpose, to keep people in their homes.  Some states have actually established agencies to put money into the pockets of landlords to keep people in their homes the majority of states haven't.  Instead of keeping the mandate in place the Supreme Court has now opened the flood gates to evictions and the addition of thousands of homeless Americans.  As has been said here the major reason people don't pay their rent is job loss.  The previous administration touted the greatest job creation administration in history, which it wasn't.  Now we have the supreme court stepping in to basically evict thousands of families and to what end.  The landlords will attempt to sue these people for back rent which they can't pay and even if they obtain a judgment they will simply walk away.  The Biden administration gave the landlords a mechanism to get some payments but that's only if the renters can stay. With this decision everybody looses.  The supreme court got it wrong, again."

The proper way to create ongoing policy is through legislation and this article clearly states that Congress did not take any action here. That's the end of the discussion. The Court already provided an extension in order to provide for a smoother transition. Biden tried to extend this further but his comments at the time indicated that he knew this was illegal and likely to fail in the courts. What has come to pass is an example of the balance of powers working as it should. Everybody knows this. Biden knows this. The Court knows this. Even Cori Bush knows this. But they are all posturing and scoring points on Twitter and cable news rather than figuring out how to actually help people.

Now, it's true that the eviction moratorium was overturned by a right-wing Supreme Court. But the GQP will use in in '22 and '24 as ""proof of Biden's failure."" We've seen that they are capable of lying and even endangering the health and lives of their own supporters to ""own the libs."" 

But if the reason people lose their homes is ultimately due to GQP congressional reps refusing to prevent it, this will not be an ""own the libs"" opportunity. 

Yes, this is a cynical approach that is most likely a waste of time. But the era we are living in is not ""politics as usual."" Trump, Trump Jr., and DeSantis -- the current GQP front-runners -- are dangerous.

As for the CDC saying that it would increase the likelihood of a spread of the virus, this is unequivocally true, but hard to prove or even legally support since money has been allotted to help renters, and most has not been given out.

Giving the appropriated money out would help renters and landlords, and seems like the simplest short term solution.

No one should be homeless, and Congress needs to act on this, either through more money, or an extension of the moratorium on evictions.  Shame on them for not acting sooner.  President Biden knew he was fighting a losing battle, but at least he bought renters some time."

As is so often the case down there  a complete lack of imagination about the circumstances of the less fortunate is very evident. Of course millions of people were better off due to extra payments and should pay their rent in full. However millions of others were far worse off particularly in black and Hispanic communities due to illness, the need to stay home with children or lack of knowledge to claim benefits. Surely courts can try to distinguish between those who should have paid and those who could not"
2021-08-27 14:43:05,"This was beyond doubt the appropriate decision.

SCOTUS ruled as it did because the nationwide eviction moratorium clearly exceeded the authority of a Federal agency, the CDC. It's noteworthy that when a Federal agency exceeds its authority to achieve conservative goals, progressives do not hesitate to invoke the power of the judiciary. This is how our system works.

SCOTUS did not directly address the Constitutional restriction imposed by the ""takings"" clause in the 5th Amendment, and progressives should prepare itself for the possibility that even a Congressionally mandated eviction moratorium may be declared unconstitutional. Moratoriums are not ""free,"" they are paid for by landlords who do not receive rent payments, and are required to provide ""free"" housing.  Many landlords are ""mom and pop"" entities, who still must meet their own expenses, including taxes, utilities, mortgages, maintenance, etc.

The correct response is for Congress to provide rent support, and not for Congress to require landlords to bear the cost of eviction moratoriums from their own pockets.  Congress has tried to do this, but government agencies can't get their act together, and distribute the allocated money to the needy, even after many months. There's a lesson here.

A final question: given the obvious need for the government to move forward with rent subsidies, why did the progressives make Juneteenth a paid holiday in 2021, when there are so many government jobs that need to be done."
2021-08-27 14:36:16,"This is happening largely because Republican governors are essentially stealing the federal funds intended for rental relief. Their doing it for the same reason most of them are encouraging the spread of covid in their states. To inflict pain on their constituents. So they can say ""wasn't it better with Trump"". Republicans have no constructive ideas to help people, not even the fools that vote for them but they know hate and misery can be used to manipulate. If any states are not going to use the federal funds they were given expressly for this issue then the government needs to take those funds back from them."
2021-08-27 14:43:57,"The day of reckoning for delinquent renters has now come.  This should not be any surprise to anyone, SCOTUS already said that the CDC moratorium was unconstitutional and that they would NOT rule to extend it again.  Congress failed to pass a legal moratorium so the fault rests with Congress.  

The exact number of people who ""MIGHT"" be evicted is only a guess based on limited and questionable polling.  At one time the housing ""activists"" said ""40 million people will be out on the street""  Now the number is 3 million.  I would say the number is far far less now that the flow of assistance has improved in some states.  

In red states, who have already let their own moratoriums end and have passed executive orders prohibiting local municipalities from enacting their own, the chickens have come to roost.  Charitable organizations and public housing agencies will have to deal with things as best they can.  

Tens of thousands of Mom and Pop landlords have sold their rental properties to the big corporate real estate investment companies and hedge funds.  The big wigs have the money and lawyers to get the non paying people out, they will then either rehab or tear down the rentals, depending on condition, and then rent out new higher level rentals and there is no shortage of people who can afford them.

Only tenants need cooperation from their landlord (the landlord must consent to receive the funds and provide electronic transfer information). But landlords have no such limitations. So what is preventing landlords from just applying for assistance — especially the ones loudly complaining that they are the victims in this situation. If these Mom and Pop landlords are so desperate, why aren’t they taking steps to alleviate the problem by applying for the massive amount of available assistance? Nothing is stopping them! It sounds to me like they just want to get rid of their tenants at all costs and aren’t really interested in obtaining the back rent they are owed if they have to go to the trouble of filling out some government forms.

The vast majority of the jobs I see are offering minimum wage (about $16,000 annually) which cannot support the high, and still going higher, cost of living! For example, if rent is $1,000 monthly, that doesn’t leave much for food and clothing, let alone the other bare necessities, such as health care and car insurance."
2021-08-27 09:51:06,Where is Bernie? He should be appointed to be Housing Secretary. We need to end SCOTUS protection of property sharks.
2021-08-27 09:58:10,Lets look at he end result - it was a 6 to 3 decision; Republican nominated vs Democrat nominated. So to all that are facing eviction you have Mitch McConnell & Trump to thank. As usual for republicans business before people.
2021-08-27 02:55:57,"We bought our first house back in 1986. It actually was 2 tiny houses on one piece of property. We lived in one, rented the other. When we needed a bigger place, we rented both. Over the years, we've had to go to court only 3 times, for nonpayment of rent. (won, but never got any money back) We've been lucky; most renters were good so we were able to keep paying the mortgage, insurance and taxes.  I'm not rich: I'm a teacher and my husband was a farmer before retirement. I can't imagine what small landlords like us would do now with non-payments. We couldn't afford to keep up taxes, insurance, upkeep, mortgage etc. Does the government think of us? Because most landlords are not big corporations types, just little guys like us."
2021-08-27 14:57:00,"The crux of this problem is the inability of state and local authorities to efficiently disburse the housing aid that has already been allocated.  The requirements to apply for housing aid, such as computer access and technology skills are very difficult to meet for someone who is obviously already unable to pay for basic necessities.  There are not enough staffers at the designated non-profits that oversee this process which causes long (in my case, one and a half months) back-ups among those who are seeking the aid, not helpful when the clock is ticking and the landlord is waiting.  After the pandemic began, there was no sense of emergency imbued in the aid system that existed before it, which had to use the processes already in place.  State and country legislatures must review the system to make it easier and simpler for the poor and/or homeless to access the aid in the first place."
2021-08-27 14:44:28,"So many people her cheering on a decision that will make all our lives more difficult. The mindset here is cruelty without a thought for how it will effect us all. Homeless rates are about to shoot up. I hope you like tent cities, because there is one coming to your hometown. I hope you like being robbed, because high rates of homelessness and desperation leads to higher crime rates.  This is going kill people. It's going to destroy families. And it's going to make fill your town with misery."
2021-08-27 14:55:05,No government can force by decree that a particular class or group shoulder a financial burden. The federal government could easily guarantee all rents (of course there would be even more massive fraud) or come up with some other solution. This hasn't happened. The US shouldn't expect the Supreme Court to compensate for ineffectual executive and legislative branches of government (and I am not singling out a Democratic administration).

They did not lose their job
They received thousands in handouts 
They did not make even partial payments
They expected the property owners to continue making repairs and all other services 
They did not apply for federal handouts
Owners are unable to evict tenants for criminal acts putting other tenants at great risk
This attack on private property directly denies owners due process ."

Last week, they were “experts” in foreign policy, issuing an injunction regarding asylum applications that requires agreement with Mexico which is now non-existent. This is what happens when political ideologues take over the institution.  Just keep calling balls and strikes John Roberts.

The fact that the ""liberal"" justices think it's ok to take property without compensation, or that the government has the power to do absolutely anything is of great concern.  Once the so-called liberals regain a majority on the court, there is a risk of egregious constraints on civil liberties.  Complaints about masks or vaccines are trivial, but what might come in the future is frightening.  For example, criminalization of speech is coming."

There are several mechanisms the court could have used to prevent a kind of domestic replay of the Afghanistan Exit.  One could have been tying the illegal stalling of emergency rent relief to the decision — you want the rent?  Free up the relief money.

We can hope that the usual tangle of opposing interests, flavored by bureaucratic arcana, will delay putting the decision into effect.

Maybe kicking them out of their homes will motivate them to get off their duffs and make right with their debts.  Two families on my street will be evicted.  Both had dual ""essential employees"" as income, so theirs no excuse for people that just didn't want to pay."
2021-08-27 15:09:11,"The voting on this moratorium issue is very concerning. Several justices, including Kavanaugh on the last decision, seem to feel that the moratorium on evictions is not lawful, but voted in favor of it anyway. “Because COVID”” seems to be their non-legal argument.  That’s not the way it’s supposed to work. Who are they to say it’s illegal but still ok for people not to pay rent to homeowners who still have to pay taxes."
2021-08-27 15:08:13,"This situation would not exist if the money allocated by Congress for dealing with the problem was not being held back by bureaucracy and political maneuvering at the state level.

2021-08-27 15:08:24,"So Congress knew they needed to act after Kavanaugh's first opinion. They didn't, so Biden threw a hail Mary and the moratorium stood for another few weeks. And what has Congress done in the meantime knowing the extension would fail? What law has been passed?"

2021-08-27 15:20:12,"Here in Albuquerque, hundreds of renters jumped through all the hoops to secure federal and/or state rent relief. The government had it lined up to give to the landlords, and these landlords simply refused to take the funds, and are waiting to evict the tenants saying they didn't pay rent– even though they put all the back rent on the table.

These particular landlords' reasoning is essentially, ""why should I accept the money I am charging to rent to an 'essential hero' like a grocery store worker or food delivery driver, when I could rent to someone who just moved here to work in postproduction for Netflix?"" 

If landlords are going to whine about not getting 50% of their tenant's income due to a pandemic, then they should be required to take the money that the feds are serving them to compensate."
2021-08-27 15:49:07,"How anyone, county judges included, could think a letter from the CDC, which is part of HHS, would override the contract between a tenant and landlord without a Federal or State law is incomprehensible to me. I never dreamed a federal agency could have that much power. What prevents the CDC from giving all a year without taxes? Surely the CDC had that authority also. At least for more than a year they did. Amazing."
2021-08-27 15:52:43,"Even Biden said this might not be upheld by SCOTUS.  The situation is unfair to both tenants and landlords.

Then too, it’s interesting because you have to actually document the inability to pay, and apply for help, and can’t just tell the landlord to buzz off. 

I find it more humdrum that Trumpists refuse to admit when the moratorium started, and “progressives,” seem to think that they can just wave a wand at a Congress that has a tad bit on its plate already, and tiny margins to work with."

2021-08-27 16:14:02,"A lot of comments here asserting with absolute confidence that a moratorium on evictions for the non-payment of rent is a government taking without compensation. This is nonsense.

An eviction for non-payment is a remedy created by law, and laws can change. If no remedy remained for recovering the debt, it might be a regulatory taking. But all the landlords whining here can still pursue their tenants in small claims or for breach of contract - the same ways every other contractual debt is enforced. They feel entitled to a legal system that allows them to recover debt and possession in the same action, to business as usual even after a historic force majeure event that prevented so many tenants from working through no fault of their own.

It's also worth noting that ""eviction moratorium"" was always a misnomer - evictions for non-payment of rent continue in every county that lacks a genuine local moratorium. The federal ""moratorium"" provides a newly available procedural defense that most defendants do not understand and therefore do not utilize. The eviction mill has continued churning all across the country in the midst of the worst public health crisis we've ever seen.  

Beyond the legally meritless assertions here, the ignorance of what tenants who are simply out of money are going through, the callousness and entitlement on display, is truly stunning. No doubt some of these same commenters wonder why the poor and working class don't jump to vote for the Democratic Party."

We hire all skill levels, including entry, and we will even subsidize your home office set up. Yet we are still struggling to find the staff we need. I see this happening across our industry and in many of the local businesses where I live. The moratorium had a time and place but this cannot go on forever. People have to get back to work and start paying their rent again because Covid is not going away, and with many jobs going work from home, the arguments against going back to work are dwindling. The jobs are out there."
2021-08-27 16:08:21,My elderly neighbor owns a single family home in New Jersey that serves as a rental while he lives with his daughter in her home. His tenant stopped paying rent in 2019. My neighbor's lawyer filed for eviction in January of 2020. The case was about to be heard in court just as New Jersey imposed the eviction moratorium. The case had nothing to do with covid. The tenant is still in the house and not paying rent. My neighbor is about to lose the house to foreclosure because he cannot afford to pay the taxes and ownership expenses. The state will not provide relief unless the tenant submits an application. The tenant refuses to do so. How is this fair?
2021-08-27 15:31:05,Bravo to the Supreme Court for upholding the law.
2021-08-27 15:39:39,"The eviction moratorium wasn't launched to expropriate property.  The federal government launched it at the on-set of the national crisis (caused by Covid pandemic) of the proportions not seen since War War II.   And it is not over yet, people are dying, 650,000 thousands in this country so far, with about 40 million who got sick so far.  The states got the money to deal with the fallout of the moratorium--the federal government gave money to help landlords do deal with non-paid rent.  The moratorium was created to counteract the economic destabilization and humanitarian crisis caused by the pandemic.  I know a tenant who is not able to pay his rent: he and his wife got Covid in April 2020.  The wife died, and he is still treating his medical problems caused by Covid and is not able to work.  He is 62 and has to deal with his medical bills.  No family to help.  The eviction moratorium saved his life."

There will always be people looking to take advantage of any situation. They do not represent the majority. Why is this being allowed.

Landlords and tenants are at risk and each are risky. Eviction in each state is different. What happens in the interim? Will the tenant or the landlord damage the property? Will the landlord change the locks? Is eviction more profitable than the federal aid? I'm confused......."
2021-08-27 16:05:52,"All this vitriol toward the Supreme Court is misplaced.  Because Congress does not have the wherewithal to do its job, the CDC stepped in. SCOTUS correctly ruled the CDC does not have authority to direct that the eviction moratorium remain in place, stating that such a decision is the job of Congress. People are being shortsighted in blaming the Supreme Court, the prior administration, greedy landlords, etc.  Congress needs to get off the sidelines and do its work on behalf of the people."

While they live very comfortable lives , paid by us, they are willing to see thousands upon thousands of people become homeless. Poor people who work minimum wage jobs don’t have savings or 401ks or pension plans to use for rent. Since the states have held up the distribution of federal money for rent assistance, they should be held responsible. Make them pay a penalty for every day they hold back these funds. These days if you live in a Republican run state, you’re more likely to get Covid, low wages and bad state government"
2021-08-27 16:12:43,"Thank you, Supreme Court!

They say, ""Housing is a human right."" It most certainly is. But the thing is that it's not a right to other people's housing, without putting in the labor and expenses. 

This is what so-called ""Housing Rights Activists"" really mean by ""Housing is a human right."" They mean that their followers are entitled to live for free on properties built and paid for by other people, without having to put in the labor or costs, not even in the form of partial payment or by way of bartering skills (cleaning, repair work, security, etc.). 

This is not how housing has ever worked in the history of mankind. You want to live in a house for ""free"", you live with friends or family or--like the Amish or homesteaders of the 19th century--you build and maintain your own house by the sweat of your brow.  But you don't move into a swanky part of town built, paid for and maintained by other people, unpack your bags and say, ""You can't kick me out, because housing is a human right. Sure, other people built it, bought it and currently pay for its upkeep. But I'm entitled to live here for free.""

That is the mentality of every Cancel Renter--""give me housing, just for being alive. Don't ask me to pay or barter for this housing, because breathing is enough to earn me this entitlement.""

Thank you, Supreme Court, for reminding everyone that nothing in life is free, especially for people who don't want to earn their keep because they don't have enough self respect to do so."

Sir Isaac Newton gave us his 18th century version of ""cause and effect"" with his ""Laws of Gravity."" Einstein, gave us ""Spacetime"" and E=mc2 in the 20th century to better understand the world and how it works.

The interpretation of laws and their enforcement has consequences. From this Supreme Court decision, some people will die unnecessarily from Covid-19. All of the Justices  should have listened to all the arguments and considered the consequences before rendering a well reasoned written judgement."

2021-08-27 15:53:40,"We should have an eviction moratorium. 

It should be combined with the current law providing for government assistance to pay off accumulated back rent. We have that law, and the money is already appropriated ($27.5 billion appropriated right now). However, actual payments are stalled in a bureaucratic mess, pure incompetence for which someone should be fired.

A moratorium should be tied to payment to landlords of the back rent. Landlords would be wise to help tenants get those payment, because it is the best shot landlords have of getting paid in full for what the tenants themselves by definition cannot pay.

Landlords are better off if they get paid. Tenants are better off if they keep their homes. The government is doing uncompensated taking if it imposes a moratorium without payment, which is unconstitutional. We all win if we get smoothly through this impasse arising from our shared Covid crisis; none of us should welcome massive losses or homelessness among us resulting from this crisis."
2021-08-27 15:51:50,"While the situation is lamentable, I believe the Supreme Court did the right thing in this case.  It's not up to the CDC to counteract the failings of Congress, no matter how bad the implications are.

A temporary eviction moratorium makes total sense given the current situation, but Congress and the president failed to come up with a cohesive, efficient plan for compensating landlords who are owed huge sums of back rent.  Perhaps Congress and the president should not have left such a huge task up to the states, because the resulting bureaucratic fiasco has been a disaster for most if not all states.  

Perhaps Biden and Congress have the best intentions at heart, but the current situation reeks of incompetence."
2021-08-27 16:01:45,"NYT did not do a good job explaining the data which would justify the extended moratorium.  In my mind, which leans progressive liberal, I see housing prices have gotten crazy expensive in part because of the moratoriums and other artificial boosts from the fed and government.  Every low income person I know, and there are several, are doing better than ever before financially, because of the unemployment benefits, and high jobs availability.  So why not pay rent?  I am asking sincerely.  Give me the data to show people need this moratorium.  Covid is here to stay."
2021-08-27 16:10:04,"I have been reading that billions of dollars granted to individual states are not being disbursed as rent relief to the tenants who qualify.

I have to wonder why that is.  It sounds like a monumental state government failure to service the needs of its citizens."
2021-08-27 15:24:31,"It's worth noting that NYT in a previous piece reported that something like 2.2 million people are facing eviction nationwide.  What the NYT did not however report is that in prior years, before covid, the numbers were not significantly different, and often more.

While there is no doubt that covid caused some people to not be able to pay rent through no fault of their own, the numbers appear to indicate that it is not a large factor in causing looming evictions.

In fact, the rationale for the moratorium apparently was not that covid caused inability to pay rent, but rather that putting people on the street would contribute to the spread of the virus, as is evident in the govt's assertion that the moratorium is like quarantine."
2021-08-27 15:38:56,"Let's be real about this issue. What the administration was doing is forestalling an even greater wave of homelessness. 

I am really astonished by the number of people saying loudly it's better to kick a few hundred thousand people to the curb than it is to infringe on landlords' property rights or for the government to take on debt keeping people in rentals. 

I am pretty sure these are the same folks who will gnash their teeth at the government's inability to combat homelessness, then quote Reagan: ""The nine most terrifying words in the English language are: I'm from the government, and I'm here to help.""

There is a solution here. I don't know what it is. It might be messy and complicated, but it definitely is not doubling the number of homeless people so that the government can avoid debt in making landlords whole for a time."
2021-08-27 16:05:42,One way to solve the renters issue is to move them to the mansions of all elected officials who argue for free stay at the peril of landlords.
2021-08-27 15:21:32,"I'm amazed that progressives are upset at a solid and good legal decision. How would the progressives have felt if the CDC had banned their widespread and damaging protests by ordering them out of the streets and to stay home? Essentially, suspending their basic right to assemble due to the pandemic. 

Our government never should have the right to facilitate the taking of private property without compensation; it is a founding principle of our country to prevent this behavior. The correct remedy was always for Congress to provide rental assistance and to get that assistance into the hands of those in need. The fact that effective governing is harder, does not excuse unlawful behavior, or provide a reason for suspending fundamental rights on a prolonged basis. The fact that there were three justices who think this clear overreach of authority by a medical agency under the executive branch was okay, even after receiving the signal that it was not, is far more frightening to me than the pandemic. 

The ends simply do not justify the means; it did not for Trump and the Republicans, and it does not for Biden and the Democrats. The only thing keeping this politically divided country together is the now tenuous underlying belief we hold that our system built upon respect for fundamental rights can still work. If the erosion of that belief continues to spread far enough to more and more Americans it could lead to awful consequences."
2021-08-27 15:19:54,"Attorney here.  This was absolutely correct legally.  The Court is right that the CDC does not have the authority to stop otherwise legal evictions.  However, Congress does.

2021-08-27 15:48:08,Let’s be clear about something else as well: the CDC moratorium did not waive late fees OR back rent. Those are STILL payable by the renter. I am a liberal but hearing stories about people just refusing to pay rent when they clearly can is just wrong. They signed a contract. Pay up (and they should!) or leave. I totally agree with this decision.
2021-08-27 15:53:05,"The Supreme Court is totally out of control. It has given itself powers that are completely out of their role as assigned by the Framers. 

They are not only legislating, which they have being doing for decades, but are now assuming the role of the Executive Branch, taking decisions that are politico administrative, mandating that immigrants being processed wait outside the US and interfering with de rental moratorium.

The real problem lays in the way the Supreme Court it´s set up and operates, with judges that are given a life time position totally exempt of checks and balances. As a result they do not respect either the Legislative nor the Executive Branch and act like the High Priests of the Land and not like the public servants that they really are.  A reform is necessary."

If not even the worst public health emergency in the last 100 years can disrupt (well, it did to an extent ... for a while, I admit) their collecting lease-enshrined rents, they might as well leverage themselves to the moon.

Scotus may be correct in thinking that the law doesn't allow the CDC to place a moratorium on evictions, but nothing stops a democratically controlled congress for crafting legislation.  There are two injured parties here -- first, those who have suffered financial losses that cause them to face eviction, and small owners of rental properties who haven't been able to collect rents and pay their mortgages.

As far as the banks go, and the various financial institutions that fund mortgages or the companies that own large amts of rental property -- too bad for them.  Banks routinely make horrible decisions, then get bailed out by taxpayers.  They should be restrained from taking action against those holding mortgages whether for a primary residence or rental property.  Too big to fail is a mantra financial institutions have used for decades to justify mergers (that end up throwing people out of jobs) and risky endeavors.  It's time they pay their fair share.  They can't throw money at people when times are good (and interest rates high) and then scream if things turn sour  And remember, financial institutions operate with a spread between what they pay for funds and what they receive -- to cover both the costs and risks of lending money.  And if a loan goes bad, they sell it or write it off as a loss.  Or both."
2021-08-27 17:31:43,"To be fair, the Biden administration and Congress have been busy repairing the damage done during the Trump administration:  neglect of infrastructure (despite a Trump campaign pledge to the contrary); unfilled government positions; a political war against science prompting the “no mask/no vaccine” protest in the name of “fundamental freedoms;” a vicious attack on the Capital and the continuing lie of a “stolen election” (Trump did his best to steal it); global environmental disruptions brought by climate change that Trump refused to acknowledge; COVID returning more viciously; and now, an inept agreement with the Taliban that set a deadline for troop withdrawal without regard for our removal of the war machine that we set up there (all to be seized by the Taliban) or the safe evacuation of our citizens and Afghani allies.

When considering landlords’ “rights,” I think of Trump’s son-in-law who, as this paper reported, had his eviction papers lying in wait for the end of the moratorium while he neglected the upkeep of his apartments.  Does he need the money—only if he overextended his investments.  Congress will have to act to provide for the homeless who will no longer have a permanent address through which state health authorities can contact them.  The job market hasn’t recovered.  The evicted can’t move on.  They’ve become refugees in their own country.  Army bases for the homeless?  Local rent control?  Public housing projects again?  It’s everyone’s problem."

If the Republicans of today should regain power they have a court ready made to enforce their bidding. And of course, that was part of their long term plan.

An eviction moratorium in an economic crisis period is a good idea.  Most apartment complexes, like my own, are owned by large corporations that make huge profits and raise the rent every year to reenforce those profits.
I agree that ‘mom and pop’ rentals should get mortgage relief from the government. But I think statistics would show that these kind of rental places are a minority compared to corporate rentals."
2021-08-27 16:49:49,"Something I have noticed about this entire debacle is how deftly Cancel Renters continue to lie, deflect, and conflate issues in service of their agenda. Case in point:

The homeless crisis today is a direct result of Deinstitutionalization, which was implemented by Ronald Reagan in the 1960s as Governor of CA and later President of the US. Exacerbating the situation was the destruction of so-called ""Skid Rows"" at the hands of gentrification, which saw the loss of SROs, halfway houses, etc. Both trends lead to  a permanent Indigent Class, who used to be in mental hospitals or facilities but are out in the streets for lack of both.

This homeless, Indigent population has absolutely NOTHING TO DO with the Housing Crisis, which is ONLY impacting the working and middle class, and is caused by rampant real estate speculation driven by foreign oligarchs corporations, AirBnB and hyper-gentrification.

Cancel Renters are deliberately conflating the two issues so that housing that is meant for the working and middle class is forced over to the Indigent Class. In other words, deinstitutionalization kicked all the mentally ill and other indigents out into the street. Now small LLs, who had originally bought into a rental market for the working and middle class, are being scapegoated into ""causing"" a homeless crisis they had nothing to do with, so that Cancel Renters feel justified in stripping them of their property rights to hand over to their indigent base."

The Republican and their  Supreme Court motto seems to be, “Just Die Already Why Dontcha!”"
2021-08-27 18:30:58,"Leaving aside the pandemic, can't the CDC declare homelessness  itself a public health emergency since it clearly is one and also since it has proven to be an intractable problem in places like Los Angeles and San Francisco? In Skid Row in LA, there have been outbreaks of tuberculosis, hepatitis, HIV, etc, and since the homelessness problem is proving so difficult to fix, the public health issue is not going to go away either. What sensible policy decision then risks putting more people on the street? I'll never understand the religious conservative line of thinking that says a zygote in a uterus must be protected at all costs, but once that zygote is a single parent who lost their job or human on the street having a mental crisis it is so easy to look away. How is that religious or righteous?"
2021-08-27 18:06:04,The Supreme Court is a nakedly political institution that has usurped the sovereign power of the United States. It overrules the elected legislature and executive in accordance with right-wing ideological policy preferences. This week alone it has arrogated to itself the power to set national immigration policy and national housing policy. It has no legitimacy and needs to be packed or radically changed.
2021-08-27 18:07:55,"This ruling should have been 9-0.  What the Supreme Court said is that an eviction moratorium is squarely the purview of Congress and there is no law on the books that the executive branch can point to to justify enforcing one.  The opinions are very stark and are interesting to read.  Congress makes law, or should, not the executive branch.  We still do have a constitution last time I checked.   This is Pelosi and Schumer's job.  They should do it."
2021-08-27 18:24:33,Why were the landlords required to continue paying their mortgages and property taxes after imposing an eviction moratorium? That's the question. This ruling is fair; Congress has to do a better job protecting everyone during a pandemic ... not just the banks.

2021-08-27 18:42:23,"""In dissent, Justice Breyer wrote that 'the public interest is not favored by the spread of disease or a court’s second-guessing of the C.D.C.’s judgment.'""

I agree, but however callous it sounds, the purpose of the Supreme Court is not to guarantee promotion of the public interest but to adjudicate the law and most specifically the Constitution.

The promotion of the commonweal is the shared responsibility of the citizens of this country and that responsibility is focused in the persons of elected officials and the public employees they hire.

The fact that money has been allocated to address this particular problem and that so little has actually been dispersed is a clear example of how poorly our public officials and institutions are able to perform.

One clear solution would be to elect officials whose only interest was in promoting the common good. Unfortunately, that seems an impossible hope given the attitudes of too many of the electorate."

Extending the eviction moratorium had nothing to do with public health, and everything to do with appeasing AOC and the socialist left that now dominates the Democratic Party.

Socialism is the most dangerous virus of all."

The eviction moratorium had all kinds of obstacles for renters: locally high infection rate, proof of loss of income, need for petitions and filings. The back rent is not forgiven. The program had assistance for landlords. The moratorium was especially meant for families - with children - on the very edge of homelessness. Maybe y’all should stop behaving like Trumpers, give up the mindless, knee-jerk libertarianism, and consider the complexities of the issues. There are more crises ahead. Not a good time to turn off your mind."
2021-08-27 19:02:41,"Somebody please explain this to me: why are so many people supposed to be on the verge of eviction ever since Covid started last year?
The most often stated reason is many people lost their jobs due to Covid, but the unemployment payments have been higher than wages for low income earners, right?
On top of that, there have been Covid payments worth thousands of dollars, right?
And on top of that, children of low-income parents get $300 per person per month, right?
If any of those moneys have run out, the biggest problem for the American economy is employers not being able to find people to hire.
With all that, I don't see how the financial situation has been worsened by Covid for these people, or at least worsened so much that they cannot even afford rent.
Somebody, please enlighten me."
2021-08-27 18:47:31,"If landlords suddenly begin evicting hundreds of thousands of Americans for not paying rent, where are they going to find new tenants to take their place? It certainly won't be the evictees. They can't pay the rent on the apartments they're losing. So, they won't be able to rent a newly vacant apartment even if the landlord is interested in taking them."
2021-08-27 19:05:46,"It's time for Chuck and Nancy to get to work and pass legislation.  It's also time for Biden to show he has some political clout left and twist some arms ala LBJ.  SCOTUS is correct in all likelihood as we probably don't want agencies exceeding their authority, even if for a good cause.

And let's remember what will happen if congress fails to both renters and small time landlords who have a mortgage.  If they can't pay the mortgage ultimately they will default, the bank will foreclose and kick the renters out and sell the property.  In both cases the smalltime landlord (big credit ding) and renter (evicted) lose and the financial institution wins.  Legislation needs to protect both renters from eviction and smalltime landlords from financial disaster.

But the financial institutions don't need protection.  The potential default rate at present isn't that high and financial institutions build in protection against default  by higher mortgage rates for everyone to cover the risk of default for a % of their portfolio.  And they can write off losses.  And most financial institutions are highly diversified so problems in one area won't sink them. 

During the pandemic we (the guv) have mandated lockdowns, masks, we may mandate vaccines, we've kept kids out of school, we've taken  steps that led to the closing of many small businesses and job losses.  So the guv isn't uncomfortable with arrogating authority for what they believe is the greater good.  So fix the eviction problem."
2021-08-27 20:22:51,"There is and never was any justification for an eviction freeze. The initiative was not ever about eviction and had no real time frame for ending. It was a foot in the door, so to speak. The supporters of this initiative do not believe that paying rent in exchange for a place to live should ever be a requirement. They believe that housing is a right that should be provided for free. Never mind that many rental properties are owned by individuals of modest means who rely on rents as their primary, or only, source of income. That is the case for the owners of our unit who live upstairs from us. If you do not have to pay rent, why do you have to pay for anything else? Where is proposal for a freeze on paying for food, car loan, utilities, clothing, Netflix?"
2021-08-27 19:36:12,"Remember: most people who are up for eviction are the rent strikers from last year. 

How soon we forget that in 2020, AOC + The Squad and other ""pro-rights activists"" were rallying their base into not paying rent. AOC's exact words: ""DON'T PAY EVEN IF YOU CAN."" 

Cea Weaver rallied people in the Brooklyn neighborhood of 
Crown Heights to not pay rent in order to force the hand of Albany and make it give renters even more concessions than they were given already. Brennan Stultz, a rent strike activist based out of Bushwick, was organizing rent strikes all over the neighborhood. 

Are we going to pretend that these rent strikers who followed the Cancel Rent anthem, ""DON'T PAY EVEN IF YOU CAN,"" aren't the exact same people who were organizing rent strikes all over the country last year? Now we're going to say they were victims of the pandemic (lost their jobs)?

This is literally the type of sinister thing that George Orwell warned about, the weaponization of human memory:

""We're at war with Oceania!"" ""No, we're at war with Eurasia!"" 

""2020: We Won't Pay Rent Even If We Can!"" ""2021: We Couldn't Pay Rent in 2021, Even Though We Said We Could in 2020!""

If you don't believe me--or just don't remember all this, Google ""rent strike"" and you'll see HUNDREDS of articles about all the rent strikes that exploded last year. A mass rent strike happened. But we're going to now pretend that the people who went on rent strike last year were victims of the pandemic this year?"
2021-08-27 20:06:10,"Congress appropriated billions of dollars to help renters meet contractual obligations which were made difficult because of government shutdowns.
But very little of this money has been distributed.
How about this: Unless Congress does as SCOTUS so sagely and graciously has been saying, and enacts a federal eviction moratorium, renters unable to pay their back rent will be taken to housing court. That's the perfect venue to actually DO something positive for both renter and property owner.
When the case come to court, let the housing court judge decide who gets Federal rent money (and how much) on a case by case basis. Defendant owes $12,000. Plaintiff ""landlord"" sues in Housing Court. Judge sees this situation is a direct result of the pandemic control measures. Judge awards an appropriate cash judgment to the building owner from the State funding pool. Justice is done. 
The situation is now set to zero, the ""landlord"" is made whole, and the renter stays put.
Ending the eviction moratorium does not mean that building owners suddenly have the unilateral right or authority to enter the apartment (in violation of the leasehold) and toss people out into the street. That's Hollywood nonsense. The eviction process will be adjudicated and right then and there the federal money can be put to proper use. And local satraps, now sitting on the money, will not be able to exploit the cash for political patronage.

In addition, landlords can help their tenants fill out the forms and vice versa. There is enough money with the states now to make most small landlords substantially whole.

The Fed, and virtually all economists, are utterly clueless and are oblivious to these profound changes, and their stubborn, closed-minded ignorance is a root cause of the dangerous and rapid decline of the West, the stunning ascent of China, and the resulting extraordinarily volatile and dangerous times we live in.

The top-down corporate model of shareholder capitalism has failed, rather spectacularly.

2021-08-25 15:10:26,"It seems to me the best metric for ‘full’ employment is a sustained (over a few weeks) excess of positions advertised over candidates available. This metric has not been used in the past principally because positions available was not tracked easily or reliably. The data of the last few weeks would indicate that US has reached full employment. 
If there is a disconnect between the type of positions offered vs the qualifications of the applicants, it is not in the Fed’s mandate to resolve this nor does it have the tools to solve this problem. 
Finally, while the Fed may rightly construe that climate change is not in its purview, by goading the economy at all times to grow grow grow, seventy percent of which is consumption, it is definitely contributing to global warming. That each unit of consumption is associated with a carbon footprint is undeniable. The public attendance at its meeting is dominated by stock traders whose past memory and future forecast is restricted to one quarter of a year, not of a century.

It is hard for me to believe that the people who need money and would spend it if they had it, after the experience of 2008, are willing to borrow to get it.

They ar willing to work at decent wages and working conditions to get it, but there is a big econmic difference between borrowing and working at a job which produces more stuff. More stuff, goods and services, means LOWER prices.

In fact, low interest rates often creates zombie companies that have to borrow just to stay in business. Eventually, that will fail as no more can be borrowed.

Housing has an eviction moratorium that is about to end. That moratorium dropped the supply of foreclosed homes below levels not even seen during great economic expansions. 

We still have millions who are out of work. The real fear is persistent unemployment. The fed cannot control the virus which is what impacted price stability on a few goods as the economy adapts to different demands.  Many started DIY home improvements now that they have extra hours when working from home instead of commuting to the office while lumber mills closed due to the virus. 

Others learned over the last year that they can live without two full time earners. They reduced their demand and consumption rather than work in a restaurant. That means we need more fiscal and monetary support. Even if it looks on paper that wages in those industries are growing due to a labor shortage when everyone hires at the same time.

Transforming the unjust, unsustainable, and therefore, unstable international monetary system by basing it on a decarbonization standard of a specific tonnage of CO2e per person would be the greatest challenge in the next decade. A transformed international monetary system would lead to a money-based financial system and a fiscal system that aims to reduce inequality rather than provide financing for regular public operations that has to be funded by sovereign public authorities.

""We are here to serve Wall St. and the one percenters who control the vast majority of our assets. We realized we made a terrible mistake in 2008 by letting Lehman Bros. fail and nearly took down the entire financial structure. We instead kept short-term interest rates at zero from 2008 to 2013 and instituted ""quantitative easing"" QE, in other words money printing in the amount of $4 trillion. We then began the slowest pace of interest rate increases in modern Fed history to the point that the Fed funds rate was a still anemic 2.25% in Dec. 2018. I then dared to suggest that the Fed would raise rates three more times in 2019 and Wall St. reacted with the worst Dec. sell-off since the 1930s. I waived the white flag on Jan. 3, 2019. In fact we cut rates three times in 2019 leading up to early 2020 when the pandemic hit. We once more cut rates to zero as Wall St. collapsed, but our decision to back-stop every esoteric gambling scheme, from shadow banks to the junkiest of junk bonds stabilized the Street, and our creation of several additional trillion dollars led to record Wall St. returns as I speak. (I won't mention the billions of rent subsidy payments that have gone unused resulting in potentially millions of evictions.) We will keep interest rates at zero, we've bought trillions of bonds keeping the 10-yr treasury at 1.25% or so, and will serve our Wall St. masters as they see fit. Thank you and have a good day."

Conservative thinking, by its very nature, wants all in the world defined upfront and those definitions are unchanging.  Less government is always better.  Lower taxes increase freedom.  A bigger military always makes us safer.  These are unchanging concepts of conservatism.  Another way to put it is that their politics control their worldview.

To the liberal, or the scientifically minded, their politics are shaped by what they see happening in the world.  This is the essence of scientific understanding.  If a new discovery proves that a 100 year old concept is wrong, scientists will gladly throw it away and embrace the new understanding.  Conservatives won't do that.  

It's not that conservatives don't understand the scientific method.   They refuse to allow themselves to accept change, even if backed up by science.  Their politics can't let them accept the changing world.  Climate change is a perfect example.

Can we now try to be more open, patient and tolerant of questions posed in the true spirit of science (the constant testing of assumptions, spirit of open inquiry, honest discussion, evolving conclusions based on rapidly circumstances and new data) instead of pretending to be the militant self-imposed guardians of “science” as absolute dogma under the misguided sense of defending “scientific truth.”  There have been enough reversals in the Covid-19 story that we should now know that what was said yesterday may turn out to be obsolete today and in the future. I would like to hear more medical experts in public briefings start off with the words: “Here’s what we know so far…”"
2021-08-23 10:36:59,"It has really been disconcerting that we seem to be back to where we started (in terms of knowledge) 18 months in… Meanwhile, everyone is burnt out physically and emotionally."
2021-08-23 10:53:47,"Most people think  and function in terms of static certainty, not uncertainty. This provides comfort and stability and quickly puts issues to bed. But scientists deal with fluid uncertainty for a living. So while a change in course, reversal, apparent contradiction or even a backtrack is a perfectly normal event in scientific advancement, to most people, it is perceived as showing how stupid scientists are and that they do not actually know anything. Confidence is lost quickly.

Communicating that this fluidity is normal for science depends on placing that caveat up front and prominent. I have found this to be nearly impossible with most people to accept. It depends on an individual having flexibility in their thinking to drop the need for certainty.  Whereas ridicule, anger and group-think just reinforces simple concrete ""answers"" to unsettling questions. Absent certainty, people will gravitate to comfort. 

Science must be correct, conspiracy theories just need to be sensational. This is not a race for the hearts and minds of the people. Just their bodies. Mandate vaccines for access to all public spaces and events including employment. We cannot make resistant people actually believe in vaccines, but we can make life very very difficult for them if they do not comply. We do not need commitment, simple compliance will do."

2021-08-23 10:33:19,"This is a wonderful analysis that calls to mind the Socratic paradox that all I know is the fact of my ignorance, or that I know nothing. The admission to not “knowing it all” by one of history’s wisest men is the sine qua non of true knowledge. Contrary to the bloviating blowhards who speciously claim to be “the only ones who can fix it,” all the while spewing specious conspiracies, mis- and disinformation, such humility and levelheadedness are precisely what has spared us from an even worse catastrophe than we have thus far endured. If such sadly uncommon sense were far more common, there wouldn’t be so many of us who can’t even avoid the plague like, well, the plague."
2021-08-23 10:47:31,"Science, even when completely clear, is rejected by the ignorance of Americans.  Now when much science is subject to revision and reconsideration owing to the Covid virus and its variants it is even less likely that Americans will understand what is going on.  Some still don't believe in Darwinian evolution, preferring the fairy tales in the Bible.  God help us."
2021-08-23 10:48:15,"I am pessimistic that anything can undo the situation we are in with covid. Public health officisals should not have to warn the public against taking deworming medication meant for large farm animals. And certainly we shouldn’t have highly paid TV news show host promoting their use either. Carlson and Ingram aren’t stupid just unconcerned about the consequences of the games they are playing. When half the country thought and perhaps still does that a dedicated con artist reality show star would make a fine president we are finished. That viruses mutate is just basic biological science we learn in high school. The utility of masks isn’t controversial in China, Japan, or S Korea. I blame a long ignorant and lazy public addicted to short term solutions that don’t involve inconvenience and personal sacrifice. Easier to point fingers at the media or politicians in general than looking at their own role in giving individual actors such outsized power."
2021-08-23 11:07:12,"I’ve been what is called a Data Scientist for over 30 years. My passion is math, statistics, modeling in the realm of customer purchasing behavior. I’ve know at least fifty or more practitioners of this discipline. We’re all good at finding data, scrutinizing it, using statistical methods and validating our results then putting into use our algorithms. We are as equally terrible at explaining what we found to our non-statistical audiences (upper management). There are a few, so very few, that can tell the story well of what we did and found.  

I’ve watched and listened to presentations from the FDA  CDC, WHO, etc. in their attempts to present their evidence and instill confidence in their recommendations for Covid. It has been to say the least frustrating. Science is based on data, hypothesis testing, and rigorous examination of results amongst peers. It doesn’t work well  in our fast, social media, non-expert environment.  Scientists, as being made of folks, can harbor biases , be dogmatic about their theories, but the presentation of their finding are nevertheless rigorous. 

To its core Science is not Beliefs. But both types of endeavors require communities skills. I always advise to take courses in math, statistics and your discipline of choice. But also take that drama story telling course from the arts department.  You’ll need it to better communicate to a broader audience and foster better discussions."
2021-08-23 11:15:25,"I think the general population would have great value in understanding science through the work of Gregor Mendell aka ""The Father of Genetics.""
Years ago in an upper level collegiate genetics class, I remember spending an entire semester studying his work as it relates to us in the modern age.
When the class ended, I came away understanding his work on peas, and also I remember thinking it was fascinating that no one understood what he did. After his death some 30 or so years later, researchers and scholars looked back at his work and realized his significance, naming him "" The Father of Genetics.""
It is because of him, we understand many things about our siblings, parents, and other relatives in general, which all can be traced back to this Austrian monk planting peas in a garden.  This simple story highlights the lag between scientific discovery, peer acceptance, and an understanding of various concepts by the greater populous. 
When I hear "" Covid talk,""  I think about Gregor Mendell and I'm tempted to open my freezer and pull out a package of peas..."
2021-08-23 10:55:30,"The state of our knowledge about Covid-19 is improving all the time and this is reflected in the public health guidance.  For example, we know now that most infections are spread through the air, so while masks and ventilation are emphasized, we are no longer sanitizing every grocery cart and keypad between users.  (Hand hygiene is helpful, but you are much more likely to inhale the virus.)

Unfortunately, instead of embracing this better understanding and more effective guidance, some people can't accept it because to them, it looks like the ""experts"" didn't know what they were talking about before."
2021-08-23 11:17:17,"Ruth

Thank you for your well-expressed explanation of how science works. I would like to see this article in every public or private school in the country so that at least the next generation  understands  how science proceeds."
2021-08-23 11:05:39,"Here's an example of setting up false expectations by incomplete communications to the public.  The government rolled out the vaccine booster shot guidance on the 18th of August.  Everyone who got a Pfizer or Moderna shot needs a booster at 8 months after being fully vaccinated.  People who are immunocompromised get the booster sooner. Done deal.

Except, it isn't a done deal.  Looking at the CDC website this morning, booster shots are ""...subject to authorization by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and recommendation by CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP). FDA is conducting an independent evaluation to determine the safety and effectiveness of a booster dose of the mRNA vaccines. ACIP will decide whether to issue a booster dose recommendation based on a thorough review of the evidence.""

I'd guess that most people heard the first declaration, but not the second.  After 18 months and two administrations, you'd think the government would have gotten better at messaging.  Practically every statement about Covid progress should come with an asterisk - an indication that guidance could and probably will change in the future, so expect it.  That's science."
2021-08-23 11:13:28,"Science makes determinations based on available observational data, and can change course when new data becomes available.  But many people, whose understanding of science is limited to knowing how the word is spelled, treat such changes as proof that science is random and unsound.
    
So what we've got is a large group of people who justify preposterous assertions by reminding us that everyone has a right to their opinion, as if science is based merely on opinion.  

While there are certainly some who intentionally propagate false information, far too many simply aren't intellectually equipped to distinguish between fact and baseless claims.   For whatever reason, the ability to objectively evaluate the validity of an assertion appears to have been lost among a large segment of our population."
2021-08-23 10:57:31,"The problem for me, and for many, I think, has been not a lack of communication, but the way in which the information has been disseminated. Very rarely, it seems, has the info come from our government, at least, in the form of statements such as, ""We think..."" or ""As of right now..."".

Too often, what we all understand to be a moving target, has been conveyed as absolute fact: the vaccine is 100% safe, for example.

We know this is impossible to know. Very few people believe the vaccine has tracking chips; but many understand it's impossible to know the long-term side effects for something that was created a year ago.

Trust is built when the whole truth is communicated, not the propaganda."

We will encounter it many times in our lives, and it’s best to encounter it with a vaccinated immune system. We also need to hear about when the vaccine for kids is coming, and be prepared for the possibility that it won’t be approved soon. 

Delaying these critical messages is leading to unnecessary confusion, judgment and panic. I’d like to CDC to be honest with us."
2021-08-23 11:04:45,"This article is very frustrating to me in that it absolves the American public of all responsibility for their ignorance of how science advances. We are beneficiaries of incredible scientific and technological knowledge; we have some responsibility for understanding it. I’m not a scientist, but it’s long been clear to me that life is uncertain and the advance of knowledge is not a straight line. I believe we need to be talking about the fact that Americans don’t understand the connection between personal responsibility and the collective good. THAT is the foundation of a healthy society. It is in short supply in these United States, and it’s lack may kill us all, if we don’t address it."
2021-08-23 11:00:14,"Has our educational system been so systematically watered down over the last few generations by funding cuts, teaching for testing, and poor teacher resources? Yes it has. I graduated high school 21 years ago. We had one standardized test a year. 
Our teachers used resources on top of our outdated books to make sure we were getting up to date information. Our teachers had more leeway to teach for us to learn, instead of having to teach to pass the next test.
The school system I now teach in has a state test coming up in two weeks, we have been open for two week. The new variant is already taking out large amounts of our children. Community spread is out of control, we have military medical personnel on the way to help our understaffed, overrun hospitals. Yet a majority of our citizens are filling up restaurants with not a mask on sight in one of the least vaccinated states.
As an educator I see the looming closedown for schools on the horizon, yet people will have a fit about it because some said it was too early to open in the uptick while others want us to “unmask their children”. 
I already have my online classroom set up and ready to go at a moments notice. I understand the science, and see how the misinformation or lack of scientific knowledge has allowed a variant to develop so quickly and spread unchecked. The politicalization of basic safe guards is unconscionable. 
When schools are forced to close down to keep kids from dying we will be blamed. Catch 22."
2021-08-23 11:02:42,"This is a very helpful article, pretty clearly written and to the point.  As someone trained in the scientific method, i am concerned that too much of professional scientific writing is stilted and obfuscatory.  Some scientific pursuits are simply hard to understand because they deal with complex subjects.

2021-08-23 11:21:12,"Science has always been a forward and back process.  But without the scientific method, we would have no scientific success.  It is the very method of study that permits changes in direction and admits errors.  The mistake is always the belief that science leads directly to answers or solutions or it is a flawed approach.  That will never be true, but we may reduce our error rate as we learn more.  It is easy for the right wing politicians to degrade science and the scientific method, but they would rather complain than approach any problem with care and curiosity. And the concept of a systematic approach is an anathema to them."
2021-08-23 11:22:34,"I think this is wrong to state that conferences are off limits to journalists.

""In the interim, scientists present the findings to their peers, often at niche conferences that are off-limits to journalists and the general public, and hone their ideas based on the feedback they receive. It’s not unusual to see attendees at these meetings point out — sometimes harshly — every flaw in a study’s methods or conclusions, sending the author back to the lab for more experiments.""

In reality, journalists choose not to cover such conferences, probably because of the press of time or lack of technical background to understand the discussion."

When I drive to work and there is road construction I pick a different route the next day. When my cake does not rise properly I look at all the variables from altitude to temperature to ingredients in order to understand what went wrong. We are constantly adjusting and improving based on new information. Scientists take a more disciplined approach to this and are beholding to certain academic standards but we are not dealing with a need to teach scientific concepts. We are dealing with an inability to connect how we use them everyday and why the journey to understand this virus is not a whole lot different than adjusting a recipe due to newly understood variables.
2021-08-23 11:52:05,"This is such a wonderful article. And maybe further proof why statements such as 'follow the science' are so meaningless. And, as one scientist quoted says, maybe why those TV scientists who claim to know for certain should show a bit more humility, and those who are afraid to speak up (for fear of being canceled? or contradicting federal officials?) should speak up more. And maybe even that those who are willing to 'mandate' this or that should have some humility too, given that they are mandating based on what is hardly known for certain. In other words, a little more honesty, more voices, and more choice could be called for."
2021-08-23 11:34:58,"Science is a method of discovery, always seeking to gain new understanding, and as such, it does not offer eternal, unchanging “truths.”  Nor does any other discipline of human knowledge. Humans naturally desire certainty in a world that cannot offer it. An important part of education is to teach that absolute certainty does not exist. Scientists often assume that their audience, usually other scientists, understands this reality and so leave the disclaimer out. It would be trite to repeat it every time with an audience that knows this limitation. Unfortunately, the American public as a whole have not been educated to understand and accept this reality and so must be taught it under circumstances in which our desire for certainty is greater than normal. Add to that a significant portion of the population who have been taught from birth that their parents and pastors know more about science than people with advanced degrees and decades of experience in the relevant fields and you get what we have, a deep skepticism by the general public."

From real life in the US:  All children over 2 years old must wear masks even though there has been little research to demonstrate effectiveness in young children and no research at all examining possible negative long-term consequences.  

From the World Health Organization and EU:  Children under 6 years old should not wear masks."
2021-08-23 11:31:04,"I wish public health officials would start the conversation over again right now by talking about each person's 3 relationships with the virus:  
1. As potential victim, 
2. As an incubator of the virus 
3. As a distributor of the virus.
Almost all public, private, and media discussions center on relationship #1.  Leaving our community-related relationships to the virus out of the conversation and thereby giving space for people to proudly assert their freedom to make a ""personal choice"" to not get vaccinated."

No one ordered COVID, for sure, but we should all welcome any and all research findings at our door. From our “phones”, we can instantly be updated on an ever-changing scientific situation. This is an era of information, unlike the polio years of fear, denial & lost hope. This is called a novel virus for a reason-it’s never been studied before. Would people rather the scientists sit back & wait till most of us are dead while we do whatever our politics tell us? Science has stepped up to the plate & saved hundreds of thousands of lives.

2021-08-23 12:00:57,"Allow me to expand on the following snippet from the article:

""What researchers have not done is explain, in ways that the average person can understand, that this is how science has always worked.""

Here's the problem: most Americans today are not of ""average"" intelligence. You have been ""dumbed-down"" for the last 40 or so years since the Reagan administration. During my high school years in the 70's, the scientific method was hammered into us as both important and difficult process. Also, people my age had friends, family and colleagues who had suffered polio. We also witnessed the huge investment (and sometimes big problems) associated with the space program. I'll be so bold to say that we were closer to science then than you are now. 

In the ensuing years, Americans simply replaced the hard work of understanding things for reality TV and conspiracy theories. Just witness the reporting on Afghanistan here in the NYT for the last week: how can it be that it took 20 years for you Americans to understand how senseless and ridiculous your presence there has been? It's no wonder that a huge number of you think COVID is a hoax. No explanations, scientific or otherwise will help at this point."

Not surprisingly a whole swath of the population sees this as offensive, then plenty of politicians gladly drumming up outrage about churches being persecuted (donate here!) Now they wouldn't go along to save their lives, quite literally.  

 Same with arguing which sections of the department stores were ""essential"" instead of trying to limit numbers and discourage recreational browsing.  So people were encouraged to go nuts nationwide because some store somewhere wasn't thinking and roped off the baby car seats. Get the torches and pitchforks!

Likewise the language about vaccine priority wasn't always about risk, and about efficiency in delivery, it got into ""essential"" territory and you ended up with knock down drag out fights over whether the postman or the bank teller was more important, and people writing in to ethics columnists wondering if they should turn down legitimate vax opportunities because someone else might be slightly more important even though the system didn't work that way."

I think the important point is that scientists, health officials etc are people and are subject to all of the good, bad, and ugly characteristics thereof.  But the development of approaches for rigorous scientific investigation over the last few centuries have allowed immense progress even in the face of personal limitations.  In no other field has that been true.

2021-08-23 12:13:33,"This article is off the mark in a few ways. The „scientific method,“ as it is tediously called in this country, is neither hard to understand nor very interesting. I studied it over and over again in school. My son studies it over and over again now. We are not unusual in this. What is a problem is the use of vague, obfuscatory, and frequently condescending language by scientific agencies tasked with communicating with the public; this includes a marked pattern of responding to nuanced questions from journalists and the public with wooden talking points that ignore the nuance— reading from the script of the webpage. Another problem is scientists working in these agencies erring on the side of uncaution. When I developed covid in mid-March 2020 (and was sick for 6 weeks, btw, not the week or so then constantly being specified by WHO and the CDC), we in NYC were being told adamantly not to wear masks. Scientists did not know if the virus was airborne; they should have said simply and clearly that. A hubris apparently endemic to the profession seems to disallow communication about the experience of not knowing — which in fact is a very scientific one. „Don’t listen to that,“ my doctor told me in April 2020 when, still sick, I cited „official“ information about how long covid lasts. „We don’t know. We are learning from you.“ If only all scientific communication were so honest and clear."
2021-08-23 12:14:33,"Don’t forget that when the virus first arrived on the scene the CDC was run by a Trump toady who was afraid to contradict Trump’s spewing of misinformation about the virus. Trump surrounded himself and staffed the government with ignorant yes men who would not stand up to him. Trump told the country that COVID was no worse than the common cold and would soon be over. Trump knew the truth from scientists that told him privately but Trump choose to convince many to this day that COVID was nothing to worry about. Many of Trump’s followers still believe that as they lay dying in intensive care. The confusion about COVID did not come from the scientists but but Trump, the worst President in American history."

My students not only believe in ghosts, astrology, conspiracy theories, etc., but they have little ability to identify the attributes of credible claims.

2021-08-23 12:05:02,"Science provides the best current natural explanation using the best current natural observations and the best current natural data.

Science is always provisional, reputable and replaceable by better natural explanations, observations and data. 

But the basic methodology of science is double-blind and/or randomized controlled experimental tests that provide predictable and repeatable results.

Thus economics, education, history library, politics, social and theological academic areas are not sciences.  There are way too many variables and unknowns to craft the double-blind and randomized controlled experimental tests.

Our current science can't explain the basics of physical reality.  About 70% of reality is a mystery force we call dark energy. While 25% of our universe is a strange mass we call dark matter. And 5% of our reality is currently divided by two theories Relativity and Quantum  Mechanics that can't be reconciled.

I graduated from a selective admissions STEM public high school. My undergraduate bachelor of science degree major in biology and minor in chemistry taught me that many scientists like to speak and write in elite technical jargon that is only understood within their tight phony doctor circle.

Scientists tend to be very poor lay popular communicators in my experience.  With very poor human relations skills.

While our curious quest for scientific knowledge will never end.  Because we are African primate apes instead of demigods or gods."
2021-08-23 12:07:20,"In any crisis, regardless of type - health, military, financial - it begins with a period of profound lack of knowledge and understanding. In the military vernacular it is called “the fog of war”.

During this “not knowing what you don’t know” period, it is virtually impossible to provide usable/actionable guidance, but guidance grows as understanding grows. Gaining understanding is often an agonizingly slow. 

In the case of this pandemic, the process of gaining understanding was made even slower by national leadership denying the crisis even existed.

In my opinion, this fact is the root cause of all the variability in the guidance we receive. Turning a health crisis into a political issue should be in the dictionary as a definition of insanity."
2021-08-23 12:11:05,"Another factor in the confusing and seemingly contradictory flow of information is the pace at which even traditional media blurts out new developments. The arrival of cable news and its 24 hour-a-day availability shortened the so-called news cycle dramatically. Now a constant flow of Tweets puts even more pressure on traditional media, and I'm not sure there is anything such as a news cycle anymore, because reporting is always happening, and information comes like a fire hose. There is no time for wrinkles in understanding to be worked out - everything must be reported in near real time to satisfy content-hungry news outlets of all types."

But American refuse to limit gun ownership or engage in background checks. So—take that culture and apply it to people who won't give up guns, dislike government, distrust science, may have no understanding of science and generally have given up. The fat lady is warming up in her dressing room as the US pays the karmic price for their warring foreign policy. I know that sounds like a ""woo-woo"" stretch, but isn't the lesson of history and life; you reap what you sow?

We have more worldwide news on Covid-19 than we can access and read.  Published data in graphs that are easily to comprehend are also readily available. It is clear that death toll from virus infections is astounding.  The effect of vaccine inoculation is also obvious.  But some people are still reluctant to accept vaccines.

People are dying due to their own belief that freedom of not getting vaccines is their God given right. Science will not change their mind."
2021-08-23 12:21:31,"We are perfectly capable of dealing with the many uncertainties faced by medical science.

Who hasn't had a conversation with their doctor who said, ""I'm not sure what this means, I'll look into it further""

Second opinions and rounds were designed because other opinions, even dissenting ones lead to the exploration of options that weren't recognized at first.

But when the public became the patient and the CDC and NIH became our doctor these basic principles went out the window.

The line between the uncertainty of science suddenly became policy certainty. Second opinions were pushed to the background. Opposing views became heresy.

The idea of rounds where alternatives could be discussed gave way to a single narrative. Stay home and wait for the vaccine. And we did.

But while we did other doctors recognized that there were treatment options and began saving lives.

Rather than be open to a new approach, they were viscously attacked, all because their actual experience with patients did not fit within the official narrative.

This has done enormous damage to our confidence in our public health system. The delta variant now makes up 50% of all new cases in Great Britain and even more in Israel.
We're heading in that direction. 

We can deal with the reality that vaccines can't stop the variants. The CDC's own internal studies show this. But we shouldn't have to follow a single narrative that avoids this science.

It's time for a new more open public health conversation."

Thus, people rightly question whether the ‘authorities’ even know what they are doing. Sometimes, the authorities are downright deceptive for their own agendas. 

Examples of the nonsense over COVID for the past 18 months:

- Do not wear masks (it later turns out this was an intentional misdirection to save masks)

- Wash all your groceries as if they had glitter on them and you needed to get the glitter off (shortly later found to be completely absurd, packages do not give anyone COVID)

- Don’t see your closest family members, even if no one is sick

- COVID is deadly for everyone (death rate from COVID in the US: 0.09%, meaning 99.91% of people have not been killed by COVID)

- Even if you are not sick, you definitely have asymptomatic COVID (the surest road to insanity, imagining you have a disease that has no symptoms and the literal definition of hypochondria) and you are responsible for killing hundreds of people

- Homemade cloth masks and cheap, non-N95 masks will stop you from getting sick (when we all know that the masks we all wear because we STILL can’t buy N95s are useless to stop microscopic viruses)

There are countless more examples and articles like this make the public sound like idiots who don’t understand how science works."

It was the political power plays of ignorant individuals who spread misinformation to serve their own political goals. As part of that process, real and useful information was suppressed by the threat of retaliation and defunding. 

Had open discussion been encouraged from the beginning, the response to the pandemic would have been different. It was not the research that was a failure. The research has been extremely impressive and historic in rapid in identifying the molecular structure of the virus and producing a vaccine. 

The failure was at the most basic of levels. It was clear from the beginning that the virus was by the aerosol route. The rapid spread through cruise ships, nursing homes and most of all, from the super spreader event that followed the recall of Americans from all the hot spots in Europe without any precautions in place.  Yet we could not agree on that for close to a year.

But we had a president that was a germaphobe who preferred to stick to his own ignorant opinions and act as though he was a doctor. It was Trump's acts to suppress all other knowledge that dug the grave we are in."

The mere fact that it may have to reverse a recommendation is proof that it cannot act like or be political in any way. The imperfection of the health agencies is not the problem. As far as Fox and Facebook were concerned the CDC was a pig ready to be stuck. Their media model depends on doubt and distrust. Given what they are doing the NYT should be running articles in praise of countries that have acted to keep their disinformation machines from infecting their public information systems.

I agree with the commenter below who says scientific community needs more top-notch PR to explain science in ways we can understand. Both Dr Fauci and Dr Friedan have been excellent. 

But when you have a dominant political party and its media outlets arguing against Dr Fauci’s explanations and advice, and using uncertainty itself to take the wind out of any sails leading to understanding and improvement, that’s another problem entirely. Doubt is the stock in trade at Fox News.

Which is it? Are Americans engaged in these discussions on the science behind public health strategies or not?

I doubt that most Americans pay a lot of attention to these matters. They generally follow the advice of their doctors and people they trust.

Fifty-seven percent of eligible Americans, about 190 million, have received at least one dose of a COVID vaccine and   167 million, or 51 percent, are fully vaccinated. Vaccination rates are increasing.

Some portion of vaccine hesitancy can be attributed not to confusion over the science, but to political opposition and prior opposition to vaccines generally.

What I’ve never seen before in the United States is an entire political party, from its former President to its lowliest minions, united in spreading misinformation, creating division and stoking anger at the cost of hundreds of thousands of American lives and the suffering of millions for its own political gain and power. 

AIDS prepared us for Covid, every American President since Ronald Reagan built for this pandemic. Then President Trump, through his own neglect, ignorance, and resentment destroyed the preparations, from the stockpiles to the early warning systems. 

Don’t blame the scientists; don’t blame the doctors; don’t blame CDC or the WHO or even Dr. Fauci. We were ready and we were prepared until President Trump and the Republican Party decided to turn Covid-19 into yet another tool to divide and radicalize America for their own ends.

2. Evolutionarily, viruses exist as a mechanism of genetic variation, sometimes bringing novel genes or other DNA sequences into being; to expect stability is akin to expecting certainty."
2021-08-23 12:43:10,"Throughout this pandemic, scientists and government health agencies have largely been silent about where the risk of COVID-19 spreading is greatest. Are you most likely to spread (or get) COVID-19 when you’re walking or running or biking outside? Is eating in restaurants the big culprit? Is it sports events, political rallies, family dinners, visits to the movie theater, weddings, attendance at school, riding the subway, visiting your doctor or dentist? 

Surely not every activity is as risky as every other activity! Surely it is absurd to wear a mask when walking outside in an uncrowded space — and doing so adds to compliance fatigue. 

Where is the data from all this contact tracing we’ve been doing? 

When you give people the message that everything in their life must be put on pause for 1 or 2 or more years, at some point they just tune out the message or latch onto conspiracy theories or turn to “individual freedom” to justify noncompliance. 

If folks only received a bit more information about relative risk, don’t you think they would be more receptive to the science and to doing their part to stop the spread?"

Or that most of the misleading information and cynical view of science comes from those who continue to frame public health as a vehicle for their political advancement.  Does anyone actually think that Gov. DeSantis or Sen. Cruz, both intelligent and well educated, believe a word they are saying? Is it so hard for the public to understand that the sudden emergence of the Delta variation required a change in advice on masking? Could we be that dumb?  Not without our conniving politicians turning a public health crisis to their advantage.

Point is, unbiased information and pointers re epistemology and interpretation were/are always available.

Public understanding of science as process is weak, yes.  Nevertheless, a greater failure here, it seems, is public understanding of whom to trust.  It's pretty much never a good idea to trust politicians' interpretations of science.

Back then, for my father, there was no ""personal freedom"" consideration in taking up arms to fight the enemy.   A vaccine mandate is like the draft.  You don't have to agree with it.

We should never do what science tells us to do because it always changes.  Remember, scientists brought us the atomic bomb, agent orange, DDT, and all manner of innovations that did more harm than good.  

Policy-makers have to translate scientific information into policies.  Sadly, few politicians have any education or training in science, and blindly say, ""We're following the science.""  Too frequently that means following the science off a cliff.

True science like true journalism is about healthy skepticism.  When we abandon that, we are neither following the science nor being journalists."

The more people/media discuss a subject, the greater the chance of misinformation/disinformation and the creation of deaf ears and numb minds.

As the article rightly points out, our understanding of this virus is a work in progress yet officials are constantly being pressured (public demand) into the creation of hard and fast rules about safe behavior when they really can't. This is the perfect setup for loss of credibility.

As others have pointed out, the opioid crisis has given our medical system and big pharma another huge black-eye and lowered credibility. Unfortunately, public ire is often directed toward the foot soldiers of medicine, the doctors and nurses who risk their lives to help the public."

2021-08-23 12:49:06,"Biology depends on the theory of evolution.  Without the theory of evolution, there is no biology, no antibiotics, and no vaccines.  Antibiotics and vaccines (in particular vaccines) account for most of the increased life expectancy for humans while accounting for a tiny fraction of medical cost.  The smallpox vaccine alone saved hundreds of millions of lives. In 1800, almost half of all children born in the U.S. did not make it to their fifth birthday.  Antibiotics and vaccines were the major drivers of change, making death before the age of five a rare occurrence.  Religious extremists have worked hard to take evolution out of the textbooks and classrooms, fearing it clashes with their beliefs.  As this happens, our students have grown and continue to grow more ignorant of science and the scientific method, another target of the religious right.  Ignorance of the scientific method has led to faulty understanding of global warming and many premises that all of the branches of science depend on. It is little wonder this generation does not believe - they have not been taught and therefore do not understand."
2021-08-23 13:15:54,"I agree that science is constantly changing as we learn more. This is why it’s important to not stifle what people say even if it seems wrongheaded. For example, when the virus first spread people who suggested a possible lab origin were shut down. Now the possibility is being investigated. 

It’s very tempting to want to prevent ideas that seem insane from being given a platform. But the danger is good ideas might also be  denied a voice if we give “experts” the power to decide what’s true and what’s not."
2021-08-23 13:22:11,"Good article, but the author ignores the extent to which the political class is the main mechanism for communicating health information, and has politicized every decision at every turn, decimating trust in institutions. 

Once Fauci dissembled about masks, many refuse to listen to him. Once health officials were quiet as mayors and governors advocated some protests (but not others), despite lockdowns, their credibility was gone. As schools closed and imposed mask orders without compelling evidence, their credibility is shot.  And somehow media, including NYT, has failed to address natural immunity after Covid, abandoning the ""herd immunity"" concept that was presented as the way out of the pandemic prior to vaccines. 

It's true that many lay people don't understand how scientific consensus develops, but the failures in communicating sound, apolitical public policy go well beyond that. Skepticism is necessary to arrive at truth, and public health officials have done a terrible job addressing people's reasonable skepticism as politicians have dissembled, backtracked, and occasionally outright lied as they assert that some scientific certainty underlies their increasingly intrusive responses to this pandemic."
2021-08-23 13:17:43,"""What researchers have not done is explain, in ways that the average person can understand, that this is how science has always worked.""

We learned basic scientific principles, hypotheses and data collection in 5th grade. Again to a deeper extent in jr high and then again with more detail in high school. This was taught in CA public schools in the 70's. 

That the ""average American"" never learned/still doesn't understand the basics of science is astounding."

Somehow, they’ve escaped the scrutiny they deserve, with the media almost entirely focused on Trump."
2021-08-23 13:27:09,"Many, many decades ago in Chemistry 101, which the head of the department taught, his introductory statement was that no person could be considered truly educated if they did not know any science. 
Most of the talking heads on cable and network news no nothing and so also must the producers who give them their scripts.
This also holds for some of the medical ""experts' who are rarely experts in infectious disease or public health.
The recent ""news"" that fully vaccinated people can ""catch"" or ""get"" the virus is never followed with a sentence or two that there is less than 1% that this happens, those infected are almost never ill and the infection is short lived and yes you can transmit the virus to the non vaccinated or immune deficient.
Ten there are the libertarians and the social media addicts who will not get vaccinated no matter what anyone says.
We are truly culling the herd these days as a Darwinian survival of the fittest experiment is being done in real time."
2021-08-23 13:08:58,"This article demonstrates very well how poorly the majority or Americans, including politicians and other leaders, understand medicine, science, and the fact that they are separate and distinct fields that cooperate and interact.  

The responsibility for this massive ignorance lies with scientists and healthcare professionals themselves for not properly seeking to educate the public, and with the government and media for constantly misinforming the public about the way in which medicine works clinically and how research models work in both science and medicine. 

The fact that Evidence Based Medicine - a positive medical research initiative that originated in Canada in the 1980s - has morphed into an ideological movement that influences our culture and results in both false and unrealistic claims re the primacy of evidence - while not educating the public re what constitutes good evidence and how such evidence is arrived at - makes matters even more confusing for non-experts. 

All of this does not have to have been the case, and too much has to do with the manner in which commerce has come to supersede all other concerns in the US for 40  years. In other countries, like S. Korea and Singapore, public health was not politicized as it was in the US, and scientists and healthcare professionals did a much more effective job in communicating with the public re the realities of this viral pandemic resulting in much lower levels of sickness and death."

2021-08-23 12:52:45,"Yes, like all issues in the US, the GOP have weaponized the fact that Covid is new and the science and data is evolving in real time.

The results speak for itself. The parts of the US that have the lowest vaccination rates and non existent preventative measures like masking are in most dire straits right now are GOP strong holds. 

But at a certain point the individual needs to take accountability and allow basic self survival skills and common sense to kick in. Why is this not happening? Are they not capable of learning and disseminating fact from fiction? Are they too suborn? Selfish? Gullible? Stupid? All the above?"

Good luck with that!

When ignorance abounds and PapaGanda is believed instead, closed minds stay that way.

Our brains operate via networks.  And to get people to change how they think requires entire neural networks to change.  Sadly, for a couple generations, we’ve fired science teachers for telling the truth to students and installed “myth teachers” instead.  Once your brain operates with “Myth Networks” - science is out the window.  It’s like a foreign language!  

Instead of trying 2 minute videos to explain basic concepts, at this point I’d urge helping people understand the “loss of freedom” due to illness, especially the “loss of freedom” one experiences in a hospital.  From entering the ER, one exchanges one’s own clothing - for a hospital gown.  One gets stuck with needles or bombarded with x-rays.  One does not “get a choice” of a diagnosis, admission to a hospital room, which medications or procedures are provided, which doctors or nurses you get …. And on and on.

Ok, certain things can be refused in a hospital.  But if you’re so sick you can’t get out of bed or hardly breathe?  Is that the “freedom” these people want?  Is that the science they reject?"
2021-08-23 13:21:02,"Yes science is not a divine oracle.  Everything from science comes with a probability of being right/wrong.  Given a large enough number of ""best fact based conclusions"", you will always find some that turned out to be wrong.  However, it is a lot more likely that what runs out of Tucker Carlsons mouth is wrong, than what comes from an expert who has studied the issue for decades is wrong.  You ask a plumber to fix your plumbing, not an electrician."

To often in the pandemic  “follow the science” means do what I tell you to do whether it make it makes sense or not. Having to wear a mask when you walk into a restaurant but then taking it off for the 2 hours you are there and putting back on to leave just one small example. Telling people they must get vaccinated because they are too stupid to make their own decisions will not work."

Just don't make everyone around you suffer. That's not a First Amendment right."

With Donald Trump lying about Covid for months, lying about its severity, lying about when it will magically go away(April2020), lying about its impact on everyday life was enough to have many stop believing in science and the vaccine. 
And it’s not just Covid. The American institutions that lie to its citizens like the Pentagon lying about Afghanistan and Iraq, the lies about the election, having elected officials like Governors and Senators lie about Covid even existing is dangerous. The lies about global warming and the GOP denying its existence for decades will literally impact all of our lives right before our eyes.
Yea, the USA has big issues . The problem with America is Americans. We just can’t seem to discern truth from fiction and believe lies for political reasons.

Now we, like everywhere, are facing full ICU beds and a surge of infections."

These are the people that use the term ""nerd"" as an insult because they could not understand high school biology. They like their reality as an easily resolved, 30 minute dramedy and cling to the hope that real life is like that, contrary to all evidence."
2021-08-23 13:40:43,"Great article, another example of excellent science writing in the Times.

As a scientist, I do not apologize for the fact that I cannot provide  clear-cut answers about most anything. That's because I am studying complex phenomena with limited data available. When there is better data and better analysis methods, the answers get clearer, but there is never complete certainty.

That is why I fully understand the rage of people when confronted by the current commandment to 'follow the science'. I think it is stupid too.

There should have never been a controversy about masks, per se. The Covid virus is of a class that is likely to be infectious when airborne, just like colds and flu. There was hesitancy at first about the LEVEL of protection; public health officials immediately had the vision of the populace snatching up every N95 mask, so they essentially lied and said masks would provide 'no protection'. 

Officials and media repeat whatever studies arise to support specific social policies. The NYT has been guilty of this, quoting the same studies so many times that I had to read a couple myself. They were not dishonest, but had remarkably thin evidence. I would not support basing any public policy on them. 

In the end, science is an important component of formulating decisions about health policy, but it cannot be the sole basis. That's where 'leadership' comes in, which requires human judgment and wisdom, traits that seem to be vanishing today."
2021-08-23 13:42:08,"So many Americans expect from scientific authorities the same  comforting dogma that they get from religious and political authorities. It's not that they don't understand (nobody understands everything about how the world works) it's that there is no emotional reward and therefore no benefit in ""belief"" in science. In fact there is more emotional gratification in denial."

They follow phonies and frauds to get their health advice, believing that the corona virus is some great hoax cooked up by our government. We are already at the point where the politicization of the virus is gone, the decision to get the vaccine is now one of life or death. Very sadly, we see numerous stories of some of these Americans who have caught the virus, are in dire straits physically and now plead with people to get the vaccine as they realize the error of their ways. For some of these people it will be too late. If after almost two years of dealing with the corona virus and its variations and the majority of these unvaccinated individuals refuse to change their mind, then they never will. And the charlatans, liars and frauds that promoted and continue the hoax stories are laughing at these people all the way to the bank.

2021-08-23 13:44:14,"I could wish that people would realize that science is not a religion, nor a belief system. It is a work in progress by real people who have dedicated their lives to understanding everything they can, with the maximum possible objectivity, about their subject. They have spent a lifetime working hard and excelling at their work. Assuming one can do ""research"" with google and a device is nonsense. First one has to learn what one does not know, and how easily manipulation replaces curiosity and skepticism (real skepticism, not the fake kind use to deceive).

Scientists use possibility and probability to denote the best solution.

Scientists do not wave magic wands.

It is also good to remember: ""Uncertainty is not your friend"" when it comes to global warming, Covid, and other human studies under evaluation.

When it comes to choosing the best among a range of options, sometimes it isn't possible to say, for example, you must get the best mask you can afford, when you know that health care professionals under constant exposure are short of supplies while those with money and access will corner the supply. Remember toilet paper?

The medical community was slow to identify the air-borne nature of Covid, but seeking somebody to blame only slows our progress.

It's like kids with parents: it takes some people (myself included) a long time to realize that doctors and scientists are people just like us, just like our parents have human needs and a mixture of traits just like us."

2021-08-23 13:06:53,"It is difficult to understand how science works without a basic understanding of math and statistics. 

Probability deals with the future. There is experimental probability that tells us today what the past mortality rate has been for Covid  for a given group of people with certain medical conditions.  There is subjective probability that most of us use every day, which has a number, but that number is not backed up by solid evidence (and often times not backed up by any evidence). 

Think of weather forecasts. Nobody knows for certain what the temperature will be tomorrow, because tomorrow hasn't occurred. But we can give a good range, although the public demands exact values then blames the meteorologist if there is an error.  Right now, we are forecasting a pandemic, with far less experience in dealing with it than we have with the atmosphere.

I once practiced medicine, When I said the simple words, ""I don't know with 100% certainty,"" people took it to mean I hadn't a clue what is going on. That wasn't fair, but that is how many think.

I also taught math. When students ask me why they have to learn the subject, I tell them that as citizens, they will have to make judgments and vote based on evidence and understanding of that evidence.  That doesn't usually get through, so I tell them they need math so they can understand finance, and I give them plenty of real world examples. That usually gets through. Now we need math to understand how best on a given day to survive."

I think Ms. Mandavilli's assumption is that the information being presented to the public is complicated and requires scientific knowledge is completely wrong and I would say the say thing about the experts she quotes.  The public she is referencing to is acting like oppositional high school students and are using any information to argue for the sake of arguing.  We all know that as we try to solve any problem, we gain new information and the plan changes.  The public Ms. Mandavilli is writing about knows this as well as any us since they takes vehicles to repair shops, have people work on their homes, etc.  None of us expect our mechanic to know everything about a repair, including cost until they begin the project.  The opposition to cooperating with health experts to save lives is the same as the old teenage line, ""Well you said ... "" and using this line to avoid doing the responsible thing."
2021-08-23 13:25:10,"See, here’s the thing:  the health officials that come up with the rules and broader communication around public health are supposed to be familiar with the scientific process and all the fluidity that is always at the forefront of any scientific field.  Thus they should be obligated to put this in perspective and craft policy and communication in a way that accounts for uncertainty.  The myriad of agencies that have a platform for the public need to get on the same page and control the message, preferably in a way that assumes we need to mitigate risk at the higher end of the spectrum.  The premature declarations of victory earlier in the summer and assumptions that people will act rationally have doomed us to another extended period of danger and likely encourage more dangerous viral variants."
2021-08-23 13:29:31,"Thank you for a very clear synopsis of the scientific method, and assessment of why we are where we are with Covid-19. As a scientist I've long thought that most citizens don't understand the basics of risk assessment and never really engage in them. Do most know that driving is likely the most dangerous thing we do? That the risk of experiencing violent crime has not really changed in our lifetime? That the risk of extreme weather, flooding, or drought HAS increased in our lifetime? I don't think so, and it's killing us as a nation and global community. The risks from getting Covid-19 are far far greater than those from getting the vaccine. But we just can't grasp that, or don't want to. We're not accustomed to thinking explicitly in terms of risk. But we better start practicing, and fast. Add to this the confusion and damage brought by those using vaccination as a political tool and it's hard to see how we overcome this any time soon."
2021-08-23 13:30:56,"Thank you Ms. Mandavilli for some very good insights and suggestions to address the current ""knowledge gap"" situation which is creating much of our difficulty in defeating the virus.

But I would respectfully submit that this all starts with a good fundamental understanding of the scientific method and process that should be taught in high school, along with the kind of objective rational thinking that should also be taught in high school. Clearly an adequate job of teaching these essentials for participants in a democratic society that hasn't been done for the most part.

I would add that another difference is that where we once had (mostly responsible) editors taking their First Amendment responsibilities seriously we now have ""the electronic Tower of Babble"" basically unfiltered, much less edited.

So while I do agree with much of your constructive criticism of the scientific community I would humbly suggest that the problem is, for the most part, due to shortcomings in our basic education compounded by ""the lesser angels of our nature"". As Mayor Koch once said ""I can teach it to you but I cant learn if for you""."

While it doesn't happen so much in the NY Times comments, I see it all over the comments in my local newspaper and other discussion boards.

The uncertainty now has been promulgated by the tremendous increase in communications, namely, that anyone who can speak or use a keyboard can put in their two cents worth of opinion, whether it be scientific or emotional.  The present uncertainty and confusion is not due to our scientists; it has been due to the way information is generated and spread throughout the world, much to our detriment.  Fortunately, polio was stopped in its tracks practically immediately,  Unfortunately for us now, all information is up for debate and denial, and this horrible Covid-19 is therefore bound to be with us for a considerable time to come."

2021-08-23 12:58:42,"Perfect article. I spent 30 years as a life science writer, editor and communicator. Much of my work was “translating” complex basic research so that the lay public could understand it. I also *tried* to media train scientists so they could more clearly speak to journalists and the public about their discoveries. To say that was a battle is the understatement of the millennium. Scientists are profoundly cautious and afraid to make statements that haven’t passed peer review. I don’t think that will ever change. What CAN change is more agencies (CDC, FDA) and universities employing top-flight communicators who insist on clear, contextual public information and ongoing education of the general public on how science works. Sadly, that job is the first one cut in every budget year. We now reap what has been sown."
2021-08-23 12:59:12,"""Researchers first frame the hypothesis, then design experiments to test it. Data from hundreds of studies, often by competing teams, are analyzed before the community of experts comes to a conclusion.""

This is a gross exaggeration that is food for fodder for anti-vaxers and other skeptics of science.  It does not take ""hundreds of studies...."" to come to a conclusion.  Countless life-saving drugs have been approved based on  single well-designed Phase III studies that pass scientific muster due to their rigorous methodologies.  Yes, there are smaller clinical and pre-clinical studies that take place first, but these can number in the single digits, not hundreds, and the science behind the process is strong.  

Of course, sometimes significant adverse events, including death, come to light only after a drug is on the market.  But the vast majority of approved drugs do much more good than harm.  The increase in life expectancy over time is largely due to advancements in medicine, backed by the scientific method.

But if ""hundreds of studies"" were required for advancements in medicine, we would be using essential oils to cure cancer.  The last thing anti-vaxers need is to read this article and point to the lack of hundreds of studies to support the current vaccines."
2021-08-23 13:02:00,"People should not make blanket statements like ""trust the science"", as scientists do not even trust the science.   Part of the scientific process is refinement to the point of falsification. 

Science is especially prone to being falsified when it depends upon modeling and simulation, which has been the case with Covid-19, but is also the case with climate change.   This is why we have seen Covid-19 models being so inaccurate, but also climate change models which have also had to be constantly modified to mitigate the overestimation of warming over past 25 years."
2021-08-23 13:08:26,"This apologetic article may have been intended to explain and justify the uncertainties of science and scientific discovery, but what it will do for many is justify the skepticism and distrust they feel towards the “science-based” advice  and mandates they are expected to follow regarding Covid, snd regarding any other matter where we told to follow the science, in particular climate change

The simple fact is, there are many questions in which the science can’t be trusted, and the action suggested by public officials based on it may be no better than the dictates of your own common sense. The root of the problem is failure to recognize and acknowledge the uncertainty, by the scientists and  by those who would seek to control events  based on scientific conclusions."
2021-08-23 13:13:45,"When I have seen reports of misinformation and disinformation being spread on social media, I have wondered why our health agencies are not countering the misinformation with a blitz of accurate information. As I understand it, social media algorithms are designed to favor posts that provoke strong emotional responses, so health agencies should get into the emotions game as well, instead of limiting their posts to dry facts.

I agree that the federal government should have messengers explaining the scientific process, so the public understands the changing landscape. Maybe President Biden, during his State of the Union address, could yield the podium to a scientist for a few minutes to give a clear explanation."
2021-08-23 13:34:17,"""Biology and medicine are particularly demanding fields. Ideas are evaluated for years, sometimes decades, before they are accepted.""  Or rejected which was left out of this piece.  Scientists are very conservative when it comes to accepting new ideas or theories.  They are very cautious when it comes to changing theories.  This is not because they are playing politics, although some are.  It's because most of them know from their own experience or a mentor's experience, how easy it is to confuse anecdotes versus real evidence and likelihood.  

Therefore when people clamor for the latest and the greatest in medical treatment or testing they are wrong.  Or when they decide that vaccines are worthless they are wrong.  Americans need to be taught more about probability, certainty, and how research proceeds.  Most change is not decided by a single experiment.  It's one experiment repeated multiple times and often in multiple labs.  

Science is NOT liberal.  Science is and the sooner people understand that the better off we'll be."
2021-08-23 13:39:15,"The reporter misses two important points:

1. The problem was not simply that the knowledge of scientists was evolving quickly; it was that some scientists found it necessary to bend the data in order to achieve what they viewed as desired behaviors. The medical community needed N95 masks, the scientists wanted the medical community to have these masks, and the public was told that masks weren't necessary. Well-intentioned at that might have been, it undermined the science.

2. Our schools lag other countries in teaching STEM subjects and, more importantly, critical thinking. We are so concerned about China making gains in technology, but we refuse to invest in scientific education. Instead, we train armies of lawyers and communications majors. This will only get worse until we make the education of Americans a priority."
2021-08-23 13:41:35,"No. This article conflates science with “science policy.” This has been the problem all along. Scientists use their expertise and specialized knowledge to engage in detailed and very specific research - and for what purpose? To get closer to knowledge about the topic. That is ALL. It is an end in itself.

Science policy is an inherently political process in which a group of people - maybe scientists, maybe bureaucrats - try to formulate what to tell people to do based on limited information. It is NOT the same as science itself - it is a political decision making process. It is rhetoric. 

The problem here is that we assume there is some kind of logical connection between the science itself - the actions being undertaken by scientists engaged in research - and the science policy. There is not. Science itself does not justify ANY policy, let alone the scattershot absurdities we’ve been dealing with in the last nearly two years. Science policy has to justify itself on its own - does this policy work, is it moral by some agreed upon morality, do we agree upon the goals, etc, etc. 

Science policy is what the public has been engaging with, not the science. People are happy to let scientists study in order to attain more knowledge, and they are happy to support the government in funding these efforts. What they are NOT happy to do is accept political decisions made in the interim that rely upon the authority of science rhetorically."
2021-08-23 12:55:46,"I am a science educator, and it’s clear from the pandemic that we have a lot of work to do around building skills around critical thinking and evaluation of sources for credibility in K-16 science classrooms. The Next Generation Science Standards, which have been adopted by most states, emphasize a three-dimensional approach that integrates content, practices, and big ideas, but we need to layer on critical evaluation of information and an understanding that scientific knowledge evolves and changes on top of those tenets. A renewed appreciation for science education and an emphasis on critical thinking in science could be a positive outcome of this horrific pandemic IF we make high quality science education a priority."
2021-08-23 12:59:33,"Scientific communications towards the general public has been a big challenge for decades, but indeed never so much as these last 18 months. I think that 1. scientific studies should always include a course on how to communicate with the public, 2. there should be a specialized study for science PR/communications (I'd expect this will increasingly be an in-demand study), and 3. popular scientific press should rethink their role. After all, most of us take in scientific news via popular news media and much less so via scientists themselves or even scientific institutions. I would therefore also expect science journalists to help by applying some restraint when reporting on new developments and paint a more comprehensible picture when writing analyses as they are familiar with scientific processes, contrary to the general public."

What I would add to the discussion is the role that the United States’ culture of litigation may play. For example, local governments and school boards depend on unwavering, direct guidance as a shield in litigation. Additionally, encouraging experts to speak definitively is something that lawyers will counsel their experts to do in a courtroom to be persuasive. Everyone waits for full FDA approval to be able to take more meaningful steps toward mandates. There is a constant echoing about how much more it would help the public feel the enormity of the pandemic if we could see into hospital rooms and ER waiting rooms without HIPAA compliance as a barrier. I wonder, if we look at how our health officials speak and how their recommendations are written, and if we consider the unexpected legal impact that mandates and HIPAA has had, if part of our problem in this country is not also the way our unique legal system operates and how it shapes the way we behave."

2021-08-23 13:53:15,"The mainstream press is responsible for a lot of the uncertainty and anger as well, in particular with their false narrative about who chooses not to take the vaccine, mocking some, but forgiving others because of their historical victimhood.  In fact, when the data on vaccines is broken down by county, one can see that there are pockets of very low vaccinated rates sitting right next to very high ones, and that the difference seems to be more about economic class than political beliefs.  To help the vaccination efforts, everybody's questions about the vaccines and reasons for not getting inoculated should be respected and taken seriously, instead of the current unfair press narrative."
2021-08-23 13:53:18,"An additional component is the fact that the US has allowed its educational system to languish over the last 50 years.  That, along with the internet's supposed advantage of ""now anyone can broadcast"" has given Dunning-Kruger the chance to flower — everyone is a better expert than ""the experts"", credentials mean nothing.  But science authorities contributed by overstating the case: if you need ordinary Americans to preserve masks for medical workers due to a shortage, you tell them that they don't work.  Rather than stipulating that we do not yet have answers but are taking the most reasonable precautions we can devise at this time subject to assessment, you make definite simple statements without stipulation. No doubt much of this was a response to the lack of interest in scientific thought from the last administration, but transparency still seems to be the better long-term strategy."
2021-08-23 13:55:28,"As a scientist investigating respiratory virus transmission, I can honestly say that my colleagues and I very strongly suspected in Jan 2020 that the virus was primarily airborne (that’s how you get spread patterns like we see for seasonal coronaviruses and flu and in Wuhan, which also clearly implicated presymptomatic or asymptomatic transmission, despite what Fauci said at the time), that masks were effective (my colleagues were just finishing some research on this as the pandemic started; again, this was contrary to what Fauci was saying initially), and that increases in fitness were likely (as we see them frequently when a new virus becomes endemic).

I learned a dramatic and VERY painful lesson in this pandemic, which is that non-experts have trouble seeing who the experts are. I was shocked to see which colleagues (with backgrounds in, e.g., bacterial genomics) were getting abundant coverage and which were not. You can guess the sociodemographic profiles. It was insane how many doctors were being treated as scientists, and how virology was confused with epidemiology.

All this results in more apparent scientific whiplash than actually exists. So much was known early than the press even realizes. I suppose it is hard, coming from the outside and under deadline, to take the time to discern who is really knowledgeable. I worry the whiplash undermines public perception of science. My colleagues and I “joke” we have felt like Cassandras from day 1."
2021-08-23 13:58:19,Science requires the ability to walk away from your dogma and bias. It requires the ability to hold two conflicting ideas in your head at the same time. This is exactly the opposite of religion and is why science should not be anybody's religion. Science isn't supposed to be a belief system but a method of discovering facts about the natural word. The problem is that science is done by mere human beings that DO hold on to dogma and bias and strongly resist ideas and facts that don't fit them.
2021-08-23 14:01:32,"Finally the media is beginning to offer this sort of commonsense.

My freshman year, a biology prof offered this wise definition of 'science':  ""There are no capital 'T' truths in biology, only little 't' truths.  And those are only true until someone comes along and proves them false."".

I was taught to question everything.  Intelligent, well argued questions are how the system is supposed to work, after all.  Question things now, however, and you risk being labeled a science denier.

Every science denier  has a polar opposite - a person who treats science like god, carved in stone, immutable and end-all-do-all TRUE.  Both have little understanding of how science works.

Perhaps if the media stopped reporting every single thing that comes up and politicians stopped trying to manipulate people into the behavior of the minute, the general public wouldn't be so worn out and cranky.  ""Get your shot, ditch your mask and get your life back"" was simple marketing designed to increase vaccination rates. 

Any scientist worth their lab coat knew from the onset that Covid was more likely than not to become endemic and vaccines would likely go the way of a seasonal flu shot.  Only one human virus has ever been eradicated by a vaccine after all - small pox.  Measles, mumps, HIV, ebola, chicken pox, even polio are still with us, merely suppressed by vaccination.

What if there had been a president like Roosevelt who talked to the citizens as World War Two began and allayed their fears while encouraging their patriotic efforts?

Yes, Science can take a while to figure things out, but it is not Science's fault there is deliberate misinformation propagated by anti-science ideologues. Resistance to Evolution was driven by those wanting to push back against scientists warnings about the tobacco-cancer link, about pesticide and pharma abuse. It was a strategy to rally the ignorant that played into the bruised egos of religionists how have been ceding ground to reason for centuries.
We know vaccines work - polio for example. This pandemic has had vaccines tested even more rigorously. I suspect than any other vaccine.

Sorry, but that is just not the case.  If it were true, most people would still be wearing masks and almost everyone would have received the vaccine already.  

People listen to hearsay or credulously accept ""alternate"" treatments, and follow non-science advise based on their ideology.  When presented with facts that are in conflict with their ideology, the vast majority of people will entrench deeper.  Very few will change their position.  

This lack of analytical thinking will keep covid around and mutating for a long time."
2021-08-23 14:18:15,"Of course there's uncertainty behind scientific findings and therapeutics that result from them.  To think otherwise is lacking an understanding of the constant probing, questioning that is science.  The problem is that certain politicians, and thus a segment of our population, are using any scintilla of doubt to throw out all the science on vaccination, mask wearing, and social distancing.  They need a lesson from a past Nobel laureate on confirmation bias, as they only seem to listen to science or misinformation that confirms their existing beliefs.  

That these folks (the deniers) do not apply the same criteria to other things they consume--food, drink, drugs--highlights the problem.  How many of them, say, look at the side effects on the label of any of the drugs they take for other indications?  Not many, I'd venture.

GOP politicians (and yes, some media) have played on doubts/fears regarding Covid.  This is not a new tactic for them (see everything from guns to gay marriage), but it can and likely will destroy what this country was founded upon.  Just show my, say, five GOP politicians with integrity.  I'll wait."
2021-08-23 14:23:12,"I can't understand why so many people are railing against the scientific experts during the pandemic, sneering at their hesitation, contradictory information and flip-flops.  We are dealing with a new, evolving virus, and the experts are doing their best to understand it and deal with it.  By and large, the broad measures taken - vaccinations, masking and distancing - have proved effective. If you expect absolute certainty from science, you misunderstand how it works.  It's a work in progress."
2021-08-23 14:28:00,"It’s not really that uncertain is it?

Anyone with a high school education should understand that science always updates it’s understanding based on the emergence of nee evidence and facts.  It’s why Einstein’s theories replaced Newton’s, and why they remain Theories instead of Laws.

All that said, has there really been that much “uncertainty”.  Other than the mistake by the CDC to trust unmasking to the honor system, how much have things really changed from what we already knew we knew or suspected about COVID.

- Vaccines don’t protect you from COVID exposure, they prevent serious illness at an efficacy rate of 95 and death at an efficacy rate over 98 percent. Known since vaccines came out of the second clinical trial.

- The virus was always likely to mutate into more virulent strains that were either more contagious or more deadly, or both. Suspected from the beginning and known very early on.

- Given COVID while much more serious is in the same viral family as the cold and the flu - it is a coronavirus, booster shots were always going to be necessary. Known since the beginning, now know to be at around eight months.

- Getting vaccinated remains the best protection.  Serious illness and death is higher in regions with a higher percentage of the population unvaccinated.  Known from the beginning, being discovered by antivaxers in those communities by the day.

Not much uncertainty.

Get vaccinated, require vaccinations indoors, get your booster, mask up when not sure."

Engineering is about things we know well for example how to build bridges that last, building that won’t collapse...(or should not). 

Sciences is at the verge of the unknown. Managing the unknown is more than being in the safe inner zone of a confidence interval. Instinct become paradoxically crucial for scientific development. It is far far away from an all blue or all red want-to-be-powerful (and thus authoritarian) politics. 

But really all of us (scientist, politician, and anyone else) need managing ""errors"" when unknown takes a negative turn. The dream of getting out of Afghanistan became “let’s hurry out of Kaboul”. In the scientific world, you can find many examples of unknown morphed in errors, because of a downturn.

2021-08-23 14:05:25,We live in an increasingly complex world and a many people can’t handle complexity or evolving/changing truths.   In the face of rapid change many people simply reach for a fundamentalist view of the world to find peace and stability.  The result is that many world citizens establish firm rules or laws about the complex problems.  For example religious doctrine.   Reality is shifting and evolving and in response people establish their own reality to find peace.  This explains in part erroneous beliefs about covid or religious fundamentalism and populism.    They want a reality they can believe in and understand so they create one. It doesn’t matter if it is true to reality.   It just needs to be true to their minds.

It now appears that a booster may not be the best plan for most and that actually getting a mild case of Covid after full vaccination will be best for the individual and the world.

What I find so deeply frustrating is those who distrust doctors and scientists when it comes to the best way to get the pandemic under control but paradoxically put their faith in internet rumors and pundits. They are dismissive of FDA-approved or emergency-authorized vaccines tailored specifically for this virus but will take horse de-worming medicine for off-species, off-label, completely untested use and then demand that the doctors they distrusted treat them when they inevitably get sick.

We have two valuable weapons to fight this disease: vaccines and masks. Trying to defeat COVID-19 without everyone using those weapons is like fighting with both hands tied behind our backs."

2021-08-23 14:28:55,"It is not that there cannot be certainties, but certainties are limited to stable circumstances.    That is most definitely not what the SARS-CoV-2 Virus has presented to the World.      The nature of childhood disease with the Vanilla flavor of that virus was one thing and not seemingly dangerous.    That was then and this is now!     The Delta Variant is very different.    Scientists including Physicians (as applicable) may hold positions, as may Politicians.      The positions are likely to be more valid, at least for a present time.
Given an evolving picture, no absolute statement may remain at least unassailable in the long run.     Provisional statements should be made by authorities as ultimately the virus will dictate the future.       Where even a Dr. Fauci can get into trouble, and he freely admits it, is in stating something about the present which no longer applies at some future point in time.
Given this limitation, the literal googolplex of virus particles about that act as '800 Pound Gorillas in the Room', the ability to make firm statements needs to be recognized as some very unstable ground.     The nature of anything that experts say has to be clearly communicated as a best current understanding and not projected as if it is some firm and unvarying certainty."

The NIH doesn’t do epidemiology (but tries, often funding poorly designed studies), and the CDC is full of infighting and unoriginal science. The state departments are generally disasters. Very, very few of the leaders have the skills to evaluate new scientific evidence and many are under considerable political pressure. I have commented to close colleagues throughout the pandemic that undergrads who have taken my classes clearly understand principles of pandemic spread, vaccination coverage, viral evolution, uncertainty, etc., better than the heads of our city and state public health departments. (I know, I have been in meetings with them.) If I were put in charge of leading a military campaign of course I would do a terrible job as I learn basic principles on the fly.

I've listened with great frustration for many years to poor attempts to bring science down to ""everyone"" level. There are so many misconceptions, the main one being that science is absolute and unwavering. This is so far from the truth it isn't funny. Science works to create constructs to help us understand - it then tests those constructs with experiments, and this invariably changes the conclusions we originally reached. Knowledge evolves as we learn more from our experiments and research.  There are a few significant problems with a pandemic in today's environment of need to know NOW news - and also that much of what people think of news is simply entertainment or opinion, all there to generate revenue.  The last year and half has been a series of long running experiments - we learn, we test, we adjust - but people are in general such black and white thinkers, and desire such absolute information, that there is no way to meet expectations - so frustration happens. Add to that the concept of a personal paradigm - belief system - that often is like an impermeable bubble, and we end up where we are.

A long time ago I adopted a definition of science that it was merely the best explanation of something we have at the time. 

Since we mere humans use it to explain the unknown, it is often wrong or in need of significant evolution.  So many examples
of what we “think” we know get overturned over time.  Science itself evolves. Nature evolves. Hearing everybody I know and the media parrot “it’s the science” as if it means “it’s the absolute truth” in a political context has been quite maddening.

There are very few effective, knowledgeable scientist because being such a scientist requires one to internalize ""how science works"", and very few people are intellectually and temperamentally capable of doing that.

Also, the things we are trying to understand, scientifically speaking, are very complicated.  And the available data is usually incomplete and of varying quality.

So big pharma comes up with all these competing vaccines fueled by the government. Excellent money-making opportunity. Some of them don't work so well, but that's okay. Maybe good enough is good enough. In any case, we're all making money. And maybe with the less effective vaccines, the door has been opened to the sequel: a new vaccine. Or the nasal spray or who knows what? More money.

Now we're told by the government / big pharma complex that we're going to need booster shots. In the boardrooms one can hear the murmur of approval, I like it. More money.

And even the Times reports the varieties of medical bills for those receiving the vaccine for which we were told there would not be a charge. A win-win. Hospitals win. Pharma wins. 

And now seriously, could the Times pull together your informative and investigative reporting into one larger analysis. You've done incredible work with your forensic documentary reconstructions.

Could you please put a similar team on a comprehensive picture that combines awareness of scientific uncertainty, pressure politics, and the money trail?"
2021-08-23 15:00:22,"Science is not religion. When new data shows that old dogmas are based on incorrect assumptions because early information was somehow flawed, the old assumptions are simply replaced by better informed conclusions. People who are untrained in scientific method too often fall back on their religious training which adheres too often to pronouncements in ancient texts. One anecdotal story on Facebook doesn't suffice to overturn voluminous contrary information. Science is always evolving. Unlike religion, scientific information continually improves. Too bad that so many Americans are incapable of understanding that scientists go with the best information they have at the moment.  The hubris of politicians who think they know better than the latest scientific information  is responsible for the latest surge of the Delta variant and the deaths of thousands of Americans. Those who spread unproven false information about Covid19 should be prosecuted for aiding and abetting murder."

Are we not providing sufficient science education to allow them to understand? Are those people not doing enough self-education to learn how science works? Are too many people too intellectually lazy to inform themselves and/or listen to the scientists who try to explain to them, about how science works?  I don’t think blaming the researchers is the answer, rather, this lack of understanding, is the fault of those who don’t bother to inform themselves or to think critically."

Going to school in some communities and cultures is experienced as punishment to many students. Perhaps the very low level of sensory involvement could play a role.
Outside of the multiracial privileged high achievers and legacy bourgeois, there is no cultural regard for scholastic achievement among the more average Americans. For some it is, in fact, a negative characteristic downplayed as nerdy, a condition to be avoided at all costs.
And we’re noting that Americans don’t deal well with the scientific reality of discovery, identification, and the ensuing decades, centuries of slow, evolving fact. Really?

The news media reports every bit of scientific speculation as if it were urgent news, racking up clicks but leading its public down blind alleys.  The political industry capitalizes on any thing that happens as evidence of its political ideology and of the urgency of defeating its opposition—leading to the absurdity of people protesting against a virus.

Then the politics of Trump and his M.I.A. status post-election added to the unfounded skepticism of vaccines and misinformation widely spread on social media.

But then you add in the ‘for profit’ nature of our healthcare system, including drugs, you get a mess increased with every press release and ‘breaking news.’ Added to all this is the unwritten prohibition in the media etc of using certain terms, in this case, ‘evolution’, for fear of insulting certain factions of society.

Scientists naturally qualify answers.

Our lab's owner discussed this with our research scientists more than once: 

""Business people don't like uncertainty. They want a confident answer, even if it is later proven wrong""

Yes, boss, I can have it done by tomorrow. Yes, boss, I'll have a car out front in five minutes. Yes, boss, we'll sell one hundred vacuum cleaners this month.

Research just doesn't work that way. The experimentation process is arduous, painstaking work that takes time. Often a researcher simply doesn't have enough data - you may have generated five data points in six months. Four of those months may have been taken up by procuring instrumentation and building your apparatus . Sometimes why you think something works turns out to be completely wrong. And once you get a positive result, someone else has to replicate your results. 

Think if the vaccines had, due to incomplete/slapdash research, killed one out of every ten thousand people, or had killed anyone with stage II diabetes, had rendered one of five women infertile. 

For anyone who wants to learn more, read about confidence levels in statistics. About the best you can hope to get out of a research project is, ""we can say with near certainty that""."

Science isn't about facts. It's about making sense of the facts. But making sense, insight, understanding, that's never certain. Every answer raises new questions.

Add in the political pressure to assure people that Everything Is Under Control, and the amazing things isn't that most people don't get the science, but that they get as much as we do. (And that includes me.)

The evidence is that most of us get the science around covid well enough to take the advisable precautions. The minority that apparently doesn't get it as often as not refuses to get it. And getting past that isn't simply better messaging."

But much more than that has occurred. Every single step of this ongoing traumatic nightmare, anyone who dared to disagree with the revolving and frequently dead wrong series of scientific pronouncements has been labeled (and it ultimately occurred in this article) a “bad actor.” Legitimate questions and observations by scientists and non-scientists alike have been censored and ridiculed, which as history demonstrates is the preferred tactic to keep the plebeians in line.

2021-08-23 15:13:13,"Thank you Apoorva Mandavilli for finally publishing an article about the Covid pandemic to explain how medical science, public health policy, and politics interact. Of most importance, science, and most certainly medical science, is and always has been, “fluid.” Every well-designed and carefully conducted study adds understanding, but with varying degrees of uncertainty; it is not unexpected that subsequent studies may produce contradictory results.
Usually, the disease or issue under study affects a relatively small segment of the population; therefore, uncertainty in medical studies is not widely recognized or publicized. However, Covid affects everyone; everyone is likely to become aware of uncertainty in medical science studies and the apparent contradictory results. As Apoorva Mandavilli notes, researchers have not explained “. . . in ways that the average person can understand, that this is how science has always worked.”
Given this lack of understanding, claiming to implement policies that “follow the science” is not a safe haven.

And if you aren’t over 60, obese, have diabetes or high BP your risk was minimal

Science is no longer the limiting factor - Facebook and Twitter and the GQP and fox are equally powerful negative forces that must be anticipated and opposed.  Effective opposition is likely to be soft and non-confrontational.

Ebola, AIDS - both were met with political obfuscation and denial that was nearly insurmountable - Ebola was tamped down only after a catchy pop tune got everyone singing “Ebola is real”.

The science of medicine comes from measuring statistical averages of large groups.  But the medical arts apply to rules of thumb about individual people, all with slightly different bodies and social circumstances.

My favorite pandemic story about this was the closing of drinking fountains in Minneapolis at the beginning of the pandemic.  That was based on science.  But there were unintended consequences: people were passing out all last summer from dehydration.  The first place to open their drinking fountain was the Hennepin County Medical Center (apparently, they got tired of all the ambulance calls).  In this case the rights of the individual won over the rights of the group.  Art prevailed over science."

However, science says nothing about what the policy should be in the meantime, while the jury is still out.  Right now, the rule is everyone has to wait until the FDA declares the science settled, but that's policy, not science.  In the absence of a raging pandemic that might even make sense, but right now I believe a reasonable weighing of the evidence and risks strongly supports giving 11-year-olds a best-guess dose of the vaccine immediately.  Parents and children, under the supervision of their pediatricians, should be allowed to make that choice for themselves."

Yes, but that is an intrinsic issue with new scientific problems. But the ignorant American expects answers, now! The scientific establishment understands that all too well. They are faced with demands from the public to provide exact durable answers, now! Scientists are caught in a dilemma. They must provide answers now that they know are likely to be changed or admit that they don't know the answers, yet. Then the changes come and their honesty rewards them with less public confidence than Fox News.

The utterly vacuous public then turns to snake oil salesmen who provide answers, now, often deliberately lying to generate outrageous headlines -- still pushing hydrochloroquine, for example. The media announce those outrageous lies, rather than providing headline stories for the multiple scientific articles (e.g., published in Science magazine) proving HCQ doesn't work. The media will always choose stories that the public will listen to, because that is what sells. The public doesn't want to hear science.

For the corona virus American ant-intellectualism is killing people. It isn't the doctors or the scientists that are providing the wrong answers. It is an American public that demands not to be inconvenienced by a virus and wants easy answers."

The entire FOX audience is now under an illusion that the ""vaccine doesn't work"".  In other words the FOX audience is so steeped in skepticism for skepticism's sake, and so insistent that no one should allow any anyone to mandate what is put in their bodies, that they can no longer see the amazing advancement of the vaccine as a whole.

Yet there are no quality studies demonstrating that cannabinoid products are effective for this.  And if anyone says there are, ask them to show you randomized controlled studies (RCT), the gold standard for medical research, that shows they objectively improve function which is required for the acceptance of the efficacy of any treatment for chronic pain.

2.  A recent review of the literature on the 10 most common orthopedic elective surgeries found that there was only RCT support for two of them showing they were more effective than non-surgical treatments and even there the support was weak.  And yet every day of the year thousands of patients because orthopedic surgeons make billions by doing them.

I am a physician myself and know that too many people have an interest in propagating misinformation to really base treatments solely on true science.

Would we have used the same risk assessment protocols, if the delta had caused the initial outbreak?

A knowledgeable patient cannot expect to acquire an understanding of his symptoms comparable to a physician's. Likewise, citizens, even those with earned doctorates in other fields, will never have an understanding of COVID equivalent to an expert public health scientist.

I have had two shots, and will have a third if one becomes available.  Despite the uncertainties, I think that is reasonable.  But I remain sympathetic to those who disagree with me.

Uncertainty begets doubt.  Americans are not sheep.  When public policy is debatable, they are likely to judge matters for themselves.  This is as it should be.

More honesty, more room for doubt, more tolerance for disagreement, and less pretense:  that is what this article offers.  I am grateful for it."
2021-08-23 15:36:52,"It seems that the fragile American psyche is more at fault than the scientific uncertainty. I wonder how the generation of the Great Depression and WWII endured and thrived, when a small cut could’ve cost your life before the Penicillin. They were made of the same genetic material as we are. What else has changed?"
2021-08-23 15:38:21,"When the Soviets failed in Afghanistan, it was seen as evidence that their way of government was dysfunctional. While the timing of our Afghanistan and COVID failures is coincidental, they both point clearly to a broken political system in this country. Historians will look back to this period of time as either a low point that preceded a reinvigoration of our government or the beginning of the end of the American democratic system. As much as COVID scares us, our systematic failure as a nation to meet recent challenges should be more scary."
2021-08-23 15:38:41,"Yes, there’s science, and having an additional layer of writers and TV anchors filtering it for the public doesn’t always help. Some of these are using it as a cudgel to bash fellow Americans, ensuring a recalcitrant population segment that will never listen to advice from organizations such as the CDC which need to reach everyone. Others peddle worthless pseudoscience. Fox News, Utah “Mama Bears,” gossip websites like Facebook and a sanctimonious traditional media all in utter cacophony.

Don’t forget the preprint servers MedRxiv and BioRxiv carry masthead warnings against laypersons or journalists relying on the papers there to draw conclusions. Preprints are a form of news for the scientific community, items of interest pending peer review.

Not too much has changed since March 2020 from a lay perspective, except that being vaccinated is now crucial. Vaccines lower risk of infection, hospitalization and death. Masks in group situations can help reduce spread. Avoiding gatherings and shared spaces regardless of purpose—a step most of us unfortunately cannot or will not take—remains the only surefire way to dodge the virus."
2021-08-23 15:40:06,When this all started last year I picked up Frank Snowden’s new book Pandemics and Human History to get an idea about the whole thing. It is incredible to learn how disease steers human history and how important it is to learn from our mistakes and missteps. But when dealing with people who expect simple answers and clear choices to complex problems yet have no basic understanding of science after a while you gotta lay down the law and force them to put up or shut up.
2021-08-23 15:44:17,"We have faced Covid and Covid variants in this 2nd year of the pandemic. The flu disappeared while we were assailed by this public health crisis.  We're in the midst of the climate change crisis, in the midst of a pandemic that may continue , in the midst of scary political changes in our country.   Who isn't skeptical  about the uncertainty of our lives and times?"
2021-08-23 15:42:39,"You don’t have to look further than our media to see how misguided America’s general view of science is. People are used to seeing characters in sci-fi wave some scanner at something and be given detailed information about its composition. Even shows set in current day (eg. forensic or medical procedurals) show people popping a couple samples in a machine and having an answer to the mystery 22 minutes later. None of that is realistic. People are also used to seeing scientists portrayed as misanthropic and reckless when the vast majority of scientists are just normal people doing a job. Of course we all know that media is fiction, but it both reflects our perceptions of science and probably shaped our expectations to some extent"
2021-08-23 15:46:13,"The only way this understanding of the scientific principle would hold sway is if it was baked into the education system from the beginning - kindergarten. Everyone, young and old, has seen things change. And, in many cases, they adjust to the situation. If you are driving on a road and a tree is on the road, you steer around it or go another way. But for some, the so-called 'conservatives', there is no going around. They will not move until someone comes out and moves that tree. They see no alternative. This is what we are running in to, a group that sees no alternative other than their originally charted course. And this is because they have been trained to listen only to the lies that support their beliefs, which may have been fine at the start, but do not lead to the solution now."
2021-08-23 15:46:27,"A virus is a living thing that changes/mutates in order to survive.  Understanding it and adapting to its as sound information about it grows takes effort.  The American penchant for pat answers is killing us.  Literally.

Early in my career, I worked as a residence director at a mid-sized university.  I had a boss who would, in response to those (including myself) who chafed at change, simply say (with strong emphasis on the first syllable and omitting the ""d""), ""Ad-just!""  Most of us are pretty lousy at it.  But, this pandemic requires that we do--that we continue to pay attention to learned sources and that we adjust accordingly.  No one ever said that living through a pandemic would be easy."

The reality is the 'science'  has been amazing and poor during this entire crisis. If Trump knew it was airborne on 2/7/20 then Saint Fauci did as well, yet Fauci told us it was not necessary to wear masks until April 4th. Over two months while the virus crushed the Northeast and spread everywhere. That was the 'science'. And do not even get me started on the supposedly 'debunked' lab leak theory.

The the prior administration streamlines the proceess resulting in three rapidly developed incredible vaccines and only half the country uses them. Outragous.

Tackling this virus should have been a unjifying American event like the mobilization of WWII. Instead, in the zealousness to get rid of Trump it became a useful tool by the media to polarize for politcal ends. Once that occurred the prior administration reacted terrilby to the media attacks. And the circle of blam began.

No leader has come forward and even attempted a unifying the response. A Kennedy to motivate us to the moon or a Reagan to push the world to tear down a wall. 

Instead we continue with the blame game. Its the repubs or the demos. What an embarrassment."

Just by including the words 'scientific' and 'unceratinty' in the same headline you are contributing to the wrong-headed notion that science is about absolute certainty or 'scientific fact'.

Science is uncertain. That's the basis of science. Hypotheses are made. They are tested. Good ones are found to be accurate to a certain degree. When the uncertainty becomes low enough to be better than just guessing, we start to use the hypotheses. This is called engineering. We build tall buildings that are very unlikely to collapse. Or it's called medicine. We take vaccines because we are less likely to die if we do."

What I don't understand is that these skeptics are all too willing to accept the science behind cell phones, air travel, combustion engines, etc., but they are not willing to accept the scientific process behind COVID-19 and vaccinations. I guess when you rely on your hair dresser, esthetician, or facebook friends for scientific information and validation, this is what you get. Perhaps these people can do your cancer treatment or brain surgery as well - they are as qualified to do that as they are for giving scientific advice."
2021-08-23 15:54:01,"As Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, etc., have demented the minds to Americans to demand definitive, immediate answers with no demand for accuracy or retribution for false or misleading answers, scientists have to deal with a populace that demands black-and-white answers for a world which is predominately shades of gray.

This is not the fault of the scientists, but the intellectual laziness of the American people. If something cannot be explained in 140 characters Americans lose interest and turn to someone who will give them an answer in 140 characters, even if that person has no idea what they're talking about (and too often they don't).

The NY Times needs to continue informing Americans of how science works. Unfortunately no amount of education will protect us from an idiotic president who recommends ""bright lights"" and ""cleansers"" as ""cures"" or the sycophants who overlook this idiocy to perpetuate their political ambitions."
2021-08-23 16:00:06,"I'm tired of this blame shifting. It's not that scientists haven't spoon-fed us information -- they shouldn't have to. Anyone who's gone through the American school system, and especially college, should have a basic understanding of how science works. And if they don't, that's their fault. This constant need to blame others for our willful ignorance is getting old."
2021-08-23 16:03:57,"As a scientist, the evolution of an emerging virus is neither intimidating nor unexpected, but for the general public, it's frequently unnerving. People have come to expect an instant answer to every problem giving rise to unscrupulous politicians who capitalize on the COVID learning curve. 

Therein lies the biggest problem. Shameless politicians like Trump exploit human weaknesses and create doubt amongst the populace resulting in too many people refusing vaccination and rejecting protection as easy as wearing a mask.

Trump, DeSantis, Abbott and several others know exactly what they are doing. They are manipulating frightened people to build their reelection war chest. IMO, they are the most criminal because they know better but wreck people's lives and America's economy thru their self serving, selfish behavior."
2021-08-23 15:51:49,"The vast majority of Americans don't understand the scientific concepts behind the words scientific law, theory, and hypothesis. They conflate theory and hypothesis, probably because hypothesis has more syllables than theory and is more difficult to spell and say.

They'll say ""it's just a theory"" if they have no concept of what is being discussed let alone the nuances of the discussion. If they have a concept of what is going on, they accept the scientific rationale. Few don't accept the reality of the theory of gravitation, but many dispute the theory of evolution.

Some medical and scientific professionals are to blame, too. It is inconceivable to me that actual doctors like Rand and Ron Paul actively misinform the public. Other doctors, like the ""best"" touted by President Trump are also doing harm. How does a rationale mind deal with ""satanic sex"" and ""space alien DNA?"" How did they get their degrees if they don't understand the fundamental concepts?"

What we took for granted in my youth - that science had answers to preventing and curing disease, that we should put our trust in scientists' ability to use their knowledge for our benefit, even if we personally didn't understand each step of the science - is now a shrieking political controversy. Down the rabbit hole we are."
2021-08-23 16:02:26,Science is pragmatic evidence based and based on precise data. Lots of data gathering and experimentations to establish statistical significance. It is precise but not accurate. No dogma. Science changes according to current evidence. COVID-19 pandemic gives real life lessons of scientific exercise to layman folks. Public health measures work like vaccination face mask frequent hand washing for at least 20 seconds and physical distancing. These measures are best defense. COVID-19 virus is always on the offense. The virus is not a passive stupid protoplasm. It is unpredictable beyond human dictates. It will find the optimal unvaccinated human protoplasm to replicate and mutates.
2021-08-23 15:50:35,"Someone finally writes about ""Scientific Uncertainty"" when the illusion of 'scientific certainty' is one of the main supports of the left.  Liberals are forever buttressing their arguments with assertions that they are supported by 'scientific' knowledge which they just naturally assume is 'certain' and irrefutable.  And now we read of ""twists in scientific understanding"" which I suppose ought to be taken to mean 'lack' of understanding.

2021-08-23 16:03:20,The problem with the unvaccinated has never been about the FDA's twitter feed. It is about the lies and conspiracy theories that they have chosen to believe for political reasons. You cannot educate those who do not want it - anymore than you can lead a horse to water and make them drink. More information is not better. Trying even harder to make them understand the changing science is only likely to make them cling all the more to their anti-scientific convictions while affording them more opportunity to invent fresh conspiracy theories.  Science is an a posteriori field of knowledge - conclusions are drawn from observation and experimentation. Their field of knowledge is strictly a priori - the conclusions they have already made are proven by the misinformation and conspiracy theories that support them. And never the twain sets of knowledge shall meet.

We should factor in a large percentage of the population will not cooperate when we model the virus and plan our policy strategy.
2021-08-23 15:57:39,"Not scientific uncertainty by any stretch of the imagination.

As a biochemist and molecular biologist, I will assure every reader that scientists were certain that, given sufficient opportunity, especially in under-vaccinated populations, the virus would mutate, giving rise to the possibility that the virus may change enough to evade immune surveillance.

They were also certain that the pandemic would continue until herd immunity came into play --- when 60-70% were vaccinated, and now 75-80% with the delta variant."
2021-08-23 16:03:24,"The CDC just needs to not say anything anymore besides get vaccinated and wear a mask in crowded spaces. That's all they can do. They should never have made it seem like the vaccine was a ""magic bullet"" that would free us from this pandemic. It never was, yet that's how it was portrayed and this combined with the rapid reopening of most states, has created the mess we've found ourselves in.

2021-08-23 16:08:25,"I have put on a mask since before it was even widely suggested. I thought it made sense because masking is common place in surgery situations where we are protecting the patient from unnecessary contact with disease and as with ebola, the reverse.
 
We were threatened with an unknown disease. So wear a mask. 
And since we are still confronted with an unknown disease, wear a mask, vaccinate, distance as possible. Nothing has changed for me at all except that I feel more safe with a vaccine in my body. 

What's the big deal? Just wear a mask, and don't get your britches in a twist over the changing details. Think of it as a new style. 

I hated high heels, but wore them when I was young because it was ""the style."" Masks may be awkward and clumsy and all of that, but so what?

Usually what folks mean by this “science” is a layperson’s interpretation about something virus related that they read or heard, which is subject to repeated change, and upon which they then build their own personal public health policy. And it’s not just armchair epidemiologists. It’s the media with their overarching and essentialist pronouncements about how all mitigation efforts need to be handled at all levels by all institutions, while the sands blow continually from the scientific authorities on all things pandemic related."
2021-08-23 16:10:28,"Americans have very short memories and are so pampered and used to ease and safety that they no longer have coping skills. If you want to know what a really bad, awful, terrifying pandemic is, read John Barry's ""The Great Influenza"". I read it in January of 2017, after seeing it on the bookstore shelf (where I worked)  for quite a while and finally getting around to it on a long flight west. I wanted to read it because my grandmother talked about the 1918 Influenza Pandemic and how when she and my grandfather wed that year, they could not have a reception because gathering in groups was not allowed.
Covid is bad, but nothing like the 1918 influenza pandemic. People died within hours of getting ill, bled from every orifice in their head, turned blue from lack of oxygen, and most quickly died of pneumonia. John Barry says at the end of the book that it is not a matter of whether a pandemic will come again, only a matter of when. Get a grip people, and start reading up on history, science, and how societies have weathered other tragedies-I have a long list of books that I have read on those subjects and they have greatly helped me understand the world and our place in it."

Somebody had to say it to America,  whose limited understanding of scientific process has created a straw dog rationale for not vaccinating.  Yes we're caught off guard and are catching up with amazing speed for science! Most people don't get that, ascribing the changing recommendations to nefarious reasons put forth purposely to cause  confusion and create doubt. Education, especially science, is the key. But gullibility and emotional response to a real threat is innate human behavior. That is why mandates are needed."
2021-08-23 16:22:23,"Wrong, the US is getting a crash course in failed education system and corrupt politicians.

Way back in the previous century I learned about scientific uncertainty, we understood how small pox, polio vaccines worked, we understood viruses mutated and that we need new yearly vaccines. 

But in the last decade we saw Pharma and politicians give up on investing in updated antibiotics, we saw celebrities and podcasters espouse ""alternative thinking"" and ""free thoughts"" in medical advice.

This isn't a crash course in scientific uncertainty, it's a crash course in stupidity."
2021-08-23 16:09:44,"It is not the job of scientists to explain science in general, or their work in particular to the public; that is the role of the media or of politicians who are tasked with converting science results into public policy. I would argue that the problems listed in this article, such as a contradictory policy on masks, was a failing of policy wonks who created policy without much science to back it up. Don't blame the scientists for that. 

The media has not been blameless either. There is a tendency by the media to treat anecdote that comes from a scientist as just as valid as a result that comes from a peer-reviewed paper. Anecdotes are more likely to be found to not be true than a peer reviewed paper, which leads to confusion. The media also editorializes, adding emphasis with superlatives that are designed to sell papers and grab people's attention, but tend to oversell the science.

Lastly, science results are heavily couched in cautionary language so that the community can understand both the strengths and weaknesses of the results. But that context rarely makes it into any articles in the lay press. That again is the fault of the media, not the scientist."
2021-08-23 16:15:58,"While our students may not test well on science, it is not a unique or foreign construct.  

Indeed, we all live in the laboratory called life which provides excellent transferable skills for coping with a pandemic. Form a hypothesis, test it, recalibrate, retest,  celebrate when you (or respected scientists) get a match, and repeat when the underlying facts change.  

Sadly, we have a concurrent pandemic of bold faced lies, outsized fear and compassion fatigue (thanks to the former guy's handiwork), burgeoning economic inequities,and abbreviated attention spans that have skewed a significant segment of the public's response. 

Yes, more frequent, consistent, yet brief  messaging may help to counter the former guy's followers lies on Fox, One America, etc.   But noted physicians and public health professionals have already been doing a valiant job of explaining the fundamentals and latest evidence ad infinitum.

Perhaps more messaging needs to encourage so called ""patriots"" to use their freedom wisely by choosing life (by following simple public health protocols), rather than imposing their choice of death on others."

1) ""we'll bring it back, just watch"". 
2) when they failed each time ""you didn't give us enough time""> 
3) de-fund or under-fund public initiatives; 
4) promise you will NEVER raise taxes. EVER.
5) ""liberty"" is more important than public health 
(Even as Mr T boasted the ""best economy"" in decades he de-funded the CDC.) 
The answer to keeping a public informed, a lesson learned from the AIDS epidemic 30 years ago and a much slower version of what we're now experiencing is 
- one simple, uniform message, 
- conveyed by one impeccably apolitical health authority (20% of the change in directorship since its creation in 1946 occurred under the Trump administration) 
- across multiple platforms (TV, radio, social media)  
- ""translate"" it for various minority groups who tend to be less trusting of government.

Really, the pandemic has been a perfect storm after decades of disinvesting in physical education and health education.  And of the chronic underemphasis we've had on requiring scientific education for far longer.

Too many people can't keep up with fairly basic terms of the debate, and what needs to happen to suppress the virus.  And they've fallen prey to obvious lies.

Part of the blame for citizens misunderstanding can be put at the feet of scientists themselves who tend to speak in a jargon often incomprehensible to the average person.  It seems the best we can do is to remain flexible in the face of uncertainty, something most of us find hard to do as often we demand unchanging answers right now that will fix our problems.  There have never been absolute answers to most of the things we encounter in life and expecting it of scientists is bound to lead us to disappointment and confusion."

Far worse, it criticizes government agencies’ information output, while totally ignoring the media’s – its – critical intermediary role.  I agree that many government spokespersons do a poor job of presenting and explaining developments in the pandemic and government’s actions (Dr. Fauci and the Surgeon General are fine exceptions).  *However*, even nonspecialist scientists like me depend on reporting by ‘responsible’ sources like the NY Times and Washington Post: we don’t read medical preprints, we don’t have access to genuine technical experts, etc., that major media people have.  

Yet even responsible media persist in inundating Americans with useless statistics.  They quote generalities, when precise statements are called for.  They contribute to the confusion by not distinguishing informed, and thus tentative, opinions from settled understanding (even as this article indicts government spokespeople for the same thing).

2021-08-23 16:28:51,"At first, I thought this article was about vaccine hesitancy or mask protests.  I'd say the messaging from political leaders like Pelosi's weekend fundraiser is the very definition of hypocrisy. If these tactics are to confound critics, I'd say job well done! If there's twists in scientific understanding of the virus, look no further then the ""sophisticated"" guests who seem to not adhere to the science even if it means being arrested at the capitol for not wearing a mask!"
2021-08-23 16:29:30,"Earlier in this pandemic the antivax sympathizers in government preached the gospel of ""freedom and personal responsibility.""    It seems that recently the same officials have dropped ""personal responsibility"" from this mantra.

Our president isn't off the hook either.  Not unlike his impatience to leave Afghanistan, BIden's impatience to put Covid behind led to his hyping of the June 15 nationwide lifting of Covid restrictions as a landmark of personal independence, without considering that Covid would then be able to much more easily strike the unprotected, irresponsibly unvaccinated population and send us into another round of peak Covid and the eventual return of restrictions and heightened confusion and mistrust of public health officials."

2021-08-23 16:30:57,"“Risk communication during a public health crisis is a particular skill, and right now Americans need the balm.”

Ohio had that, in Dr Amy Acton, but the party of “free-dumb” harassed, threatened, and ultimately drove her out of office.

And it was avoidable."
2021-08-23 16:26:01,"It has felt to me from the start that the voices of authority when it comes to instructing us how to be in the face of the pandemic have been, to a large extent, making it up as they go along.

It's better now, thank goodness, more of substance being conveyed to us.  Time is of the essence, but time is precisely what it takes to learn all we can about this thing."

2021-08-23 16:24:35,"The media and public facing public health officials wants a simple, unchanging message.  As a  start, just quit using the term immunity.  Populations develop resistance to viruses.  It is possible but rare to eradicate a virus.  
And I would suggest we reduce the use of the term science.  The public doesn't want to buy science, they want established technology.  Ask any early adopter.
People are very used to how things mostly work and yet wear out and sometimes break.  
People don't want cars that are immune to breakdown, they want cars that are reliable.  Vaccination is an old and established technology.  Very few people have direct experience with science.  Yet very few people don't have considerable experience with technology."

2021-08-23 16:35:26,"Too many Americans seem to imagine that science somehow creates findings that should last until, what, the end of human time? The end of the Universe? But that is not what the *process* of science ultimately should do because, if science is done in a thoughtful and correct manner, science will continue to embrace new data and use such new data to refine its understanding of the subject in question.

A good scientist will never affirm that we have total knowledge of anything. We humans are finite creatures. We live within the space time continuum. It simply isn't possible for any of us to know everything or even everything about one subject.

And for those who are curious my first (undergraduate) degree was in atmospheric science. 

American impatience is incredible."
2021-08-23 16:35:31,"This is not complicated.  

The vaccines work. It is a genuine modern miracle we achieved highly effective and safe vaccine in less than a year.  

If everyone got vaccinated variants and masks and other restrictions would not be an issue.  

Once COVID’s ability to easily find new victims goes away the virus goes away other than as a small problem for very frail people who will need boosters and other precautions just like they exercise against seasonal flu.  

Otherwise the virus keeps mutating because that is what viruses do.  

I fail to see why anyone considers this situation complicated."

Scientists know the truth. Supreme Court judges judge strictly according to the law, not their own predilections. Got a question, ask your doctor. Presidents? Well, they may make mistakes, but they will never tell a lie that can cause half a million deaths, solely to win votes.

Slavery was legal for75 years and women could not vote for a century. From the earliest records in ancient Egypt, right up to the present day, medical experts have been advising us to do things that kill us.   

We reach up into the divine to grasp truth and it disappears like smoke in our hands. The Taliban have no doubts about good and evil. A one point in his reign, Henry VIII burned a person to death for not believing in the Host, later he burned another for believing in the Host. 

Since we can never be certain of the truth, should we just sit on are hands let come what may? I think we should be dubious about everything and everybody. Given that, it is up to use to learn as much as we can. Learn the difficult skill of sifting through the ocean of info bombarding us in the media.

In modern times be have more often bumped up against the 6000 yearers and the clash gets uglier as time goes by.

It takes no great stretch of the imagination to see how the false pandemic information (which start with lies) coupled with the political divide (which started with lies) will lead to a new religion.

The volume with which I have heard and read people say they ""believe"" the election was stolen/rigged or ""I just don't believe Fauci"" ... believe this, don't believe that... it's troubling.

For the ""religious right,"" there is no surprise - this is how religions operate. But, I know people whom are not religious but appear disastrously close to becoming so, because of exactly this issue. I've witnessed the anguish on these peoples' faces as they work tirelessly to connect one unrelated dot to another in hopes of reconciling the misinformation they are now apparently incapable of walking away from. Because, now it has become an issue of blind faith - of a new religion."
2021-08-23 16:50:03,"Scientific uncertainty ought to be accepted as the usual course of a changing virus that is causing havoc if we do nothing to stop it. One thing is certain however, and must be accepted if we are willing to be honest, and are paying attention: that vaccination does make the difference between those going through it by preventing a trip to the hospital or worse, dying a lonely death...versus the ones refusing the vaccine based on unfounded fears promoted by malevolous minds trying to politicize the issue for personal gain. Of note, those that claim they want to preserve their 'freedom to choose' not to be vaccinated, must know that they remain the main reason others continue to get sick, even die, by allowing this virus to mutate as it spreads.We shall not be free until all of us are free. And if you think, selfishly, its your right to infect others, that is not freedom, license to 'kill' others instead. This would constitute a fragrant insult to reason, to science and to the solidarity we owe to each other. Besides, vaccines have been proven to be effective and save beyond doubt. So, please, inform yourself by trusted outlets, and proceed accordingly."
2021-08-23 16:40:04,"An interesting and important analysis regarding the failure of Americans to understand science but it lacks one aspect of the problem. The politics in play.

In complaining about the CDC, it's forgotten that the leaders of the CDC and HHS were having to walk a tight rope at getting out the truth without upsetting the president. This went on for a year. To contradict him or his staff could easily be the death knell for them as well as the loss of their influence in the decision making at the White House. 

Further, other influential politicians turned it into a political issue to rile up their base using masks, the vaccination, etc., as a tool to influence them and capture their votes thereby also allowing the gullible an excuse to question the CDC and established medical professionals. 

Again, a nice piece but missing a crucial component involved in the communication chain, a component that was the real issue in allowing this nightmare to get out of control."
2021-08-23 16:48:36,"All too often, science is taught as a set of facts that are set in stone rather than a vibrant and constantly evolving body of knowledge. This not only gives students an incorrect idea of how science works--it often leads to boring lessons and bored students.

2021-08-23 15:41:54,"CDC head Walensky has advanced degrees, yet she made the dumbest decision possible in May when she allowed that the fully vaccinated no longer needed to wear masks indoors.  

Can't blame Reagan or the GOP for that outrageous misstep.

One problem all along has been public officials and even so-called scientific experts making carte blanche statements based on very sketchy, incomplete data, or none at all.

Smart science knows what it doesn't yet know and does not issue mandates beyond the limited knowledge it has.

In mid-May, fully vaccinated airport workers in Singapore were testing positive for the virus and showing symptoms.  Genomic testing revealed that the Delta variant was the culprit, likely brought in from abroad.  Walensky had every reason to cool it.

Walensky's unmasking decision was the epitome of bad science because she only had to look to India, Indonesia and Singapore to see how contagious Delta is. Even with so many unknowns she opened the barn door.  Trying now to herd people into a masking up is proving very difficult.

Apoorva has been in the forefront of reports on breakthrough cases -- many more than we'd expect and numbers the CDC doesn't care to know, only hospitalizations.  

Today, she graciously reprimanded Walensky and others for their scientific and public policy lapses.

However, the direct quote from Dr. Syra Madad says it best:

In the case of COVID, the US has chosen a dialogue of vaccination over immunity, missing this important public health opportunity. We are a culture of high levels of cortisol and inflammatory disease - things that increase a body’s inability to fight COVID. Instead of a divisive conversation about vaccines, perhaps we can begin talking about IMMUNITY.  The EU, UK and Israel grant IMMUNITY Green Passes to those who have survived the virus and prove positive blood serology. In Israel, this test can be taken through a finger prick with results in 15 minutes. Combine that with a message of “how to care for one’s body to stay healthy” - eating an anti-inflammatory diet of healthy fruits and vegetables and whole grains, and we will move from a divisive war around pharmaceuticals and into a unified awareness of our own bodies and our responsibility to know them. COVID is the symptom - the way we communicate about health in the US is the ailment."

I just find it ironic that Republicans are screaming about their body their right to make a decision yet see nothing wrong with taking away a women's right over her own body and they see absolutely nothing wrong with either stance.

With this type of attitude things will only get worse because in their mind whatever actions they take are ""justified"" and thus ok when they would not be condoned in others.

It is exasperating to hear freedom lovers express outrage at the lack of utterly absolute permanent truth about a pandemic that keeps evolving.  Marching orders, I guess, can only be issued by the ignorant.  True experts must humbly suggest so as not to hurt the feelings of village idiots.

It is simply sad that such a majority of Americans seek faultless guidance from media who do not cover or understand science and that the American Public is so ill educated and ignorant about high school biology that they cannot adjust their own behaviour based on the most authoritative research institutions
up-to-date epidemiological understanding.

Maybe they should listen to Arnold Governator who speaks the simpler truths in language they profess to love. He does have the disadvantage of knowing what he is talking about.

Likewise, there was/is a presumption that Covid is a fixed entity, with frustrations that scientists haven't established a fixed response - whereas - the little critter has proved very adept at adopting new tactics, requiring changes in countermeasures.  At this time, I feel we are on the three-yard line - and shouldn't be risking fumbling the ball. As to the end of the pandemic... history offers up examples of decade-long ordeals such as experienced by the Hittites, eventuating in the demise of their empire.  With all this in mind, I'm dumbfounded by anti-vaxers, and especially anti-maskers whose mommas taught them without any push-back to cover their mouths when they coughed! Seriously? Seriously."

Add the arrogant politicians who've been anti-maskers since the pandemic began and you get an explosive and tumultuous chain reaction that would lead, when every thing is said and done,   to the the number of casualties in the US to surpass a million. 

For the spread and mutants to stop, every person in the world should get vaccinated; otherwise we can only expect a down spiral."
2021-08-23 17:01:00,"Underlying all this is the very rational perception that those in the media and political establishment who set narratives, directives and policies for us regarding Covid believe that we can't handle the truth.  Since the truth is both very complicated and uncertain this opinion may be correct in many ways.  But NOT trusting the intelligence of people you claim to care about wish to protect will SURELY backfire - and is, itself, foolish.  It easier to criticize than to be correct -  and you do not have to thoroughly understand something to recognize that it's being misrepresented to you.

To my frustration, a close friend of mine who was obese choose to receive her diagnosis and chemotherapy from an obese oncologist rather than from the more qualified (in my view), trim one that I arranged for her to meet.  She did die - and probably a few months sooner than otherwise - but it was with someone who she believed thought of her as a full person.  She was probably right - and I, wrong.  And if she had needed to follow advice, adjust her behavior or participate in any way with her treatment (like those of us following safe covid practices must do) then she was absolutely correct... and I, a fool."
2021-08-23 17:01:31,"""Scientific understanding of the virus changes by the hour""...That is a ridiculous over statement. First, from day one it was known to be a lung infection meaning it had to get to your air passages to cause infection. The bit about surfaces was from the beginning something people could do for an abundance of caution until more was learned. We have always known it was airborne. Second we have known from the beginning that it was a new RNA virus. We know that RNA viruses mutate readily and further that any new virus would tend to select for mutations that allowed it to spread more easily. Third, we have know from the beginning that because viruses are very small that masks would provide some limited protection to the person wearing the mask, but were more important to limit an infected person from spreading the virus to others. Fourth, we have known from the beginning that we could greatly limit the spread and mutation of the virus if everybody got vaccinated. Unfortunately we are forced to live with a bunch of ignorant people who don't have the responsibility to protect themselves and others by getting vaccinated. And good grief, how could anyone possibly know how long vaccine immunity would last and especially with new variants, when the vaccine has only been available for a few months.

""In the pandemic’s early days, Dr. Fauci tended to cite the same 60 to 70 percent estimate that most experts did. About a month ago, he began saying “70, 75 percent” in television interviews. And last week, in an interview with CNBC News, he said “75, 80, 85 percent” and “75 to 80-plus percent.”

In a telephone interview the next day, Dr. Fauci acknowledged that he had slowly but deliberately been moving the goal posts. He is doing so, he said, partly based on new science, and partly on his gut feeling that the country is finally ready to hear what he really thinks.

Hard as it may be to hear, he said, he believes that it may take close to 90 percent immunity to bring the virus to a halt — almost as much as is needed to stop a measles outbreak."""

It’s not that the info’s not out there. It’s not that somebody like Fauci can’t explain things well. 

The prob is that too many people don’t WANT to understand. Oh, they’ll dress it up a lot, but it boils down to: don’t say that, it’s scary. Tell me a fairy tale, promise me I’ll be safe, stay away from anything that messes with the way I see the world.

They are most concentrated close to the infected person, but linger in the air throughout enclosed spaces for many hours.  To reduce exposure to virus from infected person in an enclosed space, you must dilute the amount of virus by flooding the room with safe air.  Opening windows, merv 13 HVAC ventilation, portable air-filtration units will reduce the virus in a room, but will not protect you from the higher concentrations of virus near the infected person, for that you need high-filtration masks.  Most of the 'experts' in power now were taught that respiratory pathogens  were only transmitted by larger droplets that fell to the ground near the infected patient.  That 'science' was the hand-me-down type of knowledge from 100 years ago, based on the observations of a few people.  With the droplet theory, surgical masks are sufficient, vaccines outshine everything else and contact tracing, are all that is needed,  if those fail--lockdown.  The droplet theory doesn't require expensive enclosed space ventilation, portable filtration units, nor high filtration masks.  Much of what Apoorva Mandavilli describes in her article are the contortions required by our 'experts' to fit  droplet theory into  aerosol shoes, much to the misery and death of millions worldwide."

Instead of being effective educators; self promoting politicians, bureaucrats and administrators of scientific Institutions have been pushing their respective agenda.
There is no scientific or public health reasoning for the following
1)  NY City will require all education staff, including teachers and principals, to be vaccinated, a mandate that will affect about 148,000 workers. 
2) The Pentagon will mandate Covid vaccines for its 1.4 million active duty service members, following the F.D.A. approval of the Pfizer-BioNTech shot. 
The only reason the FDA has fully approved the Pfizer-BioNTech shot and not yet the ModeRNA or J&J is to take the liability issue off the table.
There is no scientist I know who has not tried to passionately communicate the need for every unvaccinated person who has never had COVID infection before to make a dash to the nearest vaccine center after consulting their own doctor and enthusiastically receive Pfizer vaccine. With regard to the booster dose, I say by all means get your antibody levels checked and if they are declining precipitously, do consider a booster. I was asked this question just yesterday by my 96 year old aunt who lives in Memphis, TN why does she need a booster if she was told she was fully immunized after the 2 doses she received earlier.

This is not flip flopping or lying.  You got new information, and you made a new decision.  

Scientists often talk about facts in a qualified way.  It acknowledges that the facts could change in response to new experiments.  It's hard to get the public to change their actions when you sound wishy washy.  In the early days, scientists made assumptions about Covid based on other viruses.  As time has passed, scientists have found out some facts about the virus that change what we need to do, things like the virus is transmissible prior to symptoms which was not true of SARS. 

 I also continue to point out that people rarely see the complete statement by public officials. We see a 10 sec portion of what they say, often surrounded by commentary made by the media.  It's not a rare thing that I hear people on TV say things that aren't correct even when they don't mean to mislead people.  These facts must play into the presentation given by officials.

Pandemics have come and gone over the millennia and they only end in one way. Everyone is exposed and becomes resistant, or dead. Viruses never go away. Since about 800, variolation and now vaccination permits us to become resistant without dying. 99.9% or more of the time. Science has also shown viruses, newly discovered after the last pandemic, always mutate to become more transmissible and usually less deadly…although not always at the same time. It also knew how to protect us. Our for-profit system though waits for the market to mature. 
Science suggested to those who were listening that we prepare. We did not. 
Equally unfortunate is the vacuum left by entities that ought to be interfacing between “science” and the public which they purportedly serve. I have yet to comprehend how our national health entities could have been so surprised and poorly prepared given all the warnings by prominent epidemiologists, the SARS 2003 outbreak, Zika, our knowledge of bat-and mosquito borne diseases. Worse, other than some repetitious calls to wear the 100-year-old (albeit) updated masks, where have they been? And what have they done for me lately?"
2021-08-23 16:57:16,"Most people think Science is about answers. This is a misunderstanding. In 2500 years of 'natural philosophy'/science, a better way to understand science is to realize that there are no absolute scientific ""laws"". Instead there is an evolving set of findings that seek to fit the universe and our models of it.

Laws may come from men or from God, but what science yields with its equasions, observations, and its tested hypotheses are models of everything from life itself to light, sub-atomic particles, and the whole universe. Perfect Forever Answers? That isn't science, but maybe religion.

2021-08-23 17:00:00,"While I agree that messaging around the science and public health aspects of the pandemic could be better, there is also plenty of fault among the Americans consuming the information.

Most Americans seem to lack very basic skills in media literacy.  They lack the ability to qualify sources of information.  In this state many people are highly gullible and easily swayed by dis-information.  That is NOT the fault of the public health experts; that is a failing of our educational system."
2021-08-23 17:04:46,"The scientific and medical researchers deserve credit for not only developing a vaccine so quickly but also the pace of learning more and more about the virus so quickly.  Science and outcomes from research is moving at a rapid clip due to technology and rapid communications (even if the computer systems as is at CDC).  That is why recommendations seem to change quickly.

The other problem is the politics of dealing with the pandemic has taken precedence over protecting the lives of citizens.  The Republicans following the lead of Trump discouraged a good portion of the population from being vaccinated by waging a constant flow of misinformation. Republican governors make the mandating of masks punishable by law.  

Democrats have also played politics.  Biden with Congressional Democrats pushing, should have made vaccination, masks and social distancing mandatory from the moment he assumed office under whatever powers he could claim authority.  He still must do it.

In Connecticut, which handled the pandemic very well, Governor Lamont is punting responsibility for reinstituting mandatory masks and social distancing by letting local towns make the decision.  

Our elected officials at all levels of government place self-interest (staying in office) above the people they elected to serve them."
2021-08-23 17:04:58,"Yes, people, that is how scientific research proceeds.  You sometimes feel like you are on a broad, empty, interstate road and can see your goal shining ahead.  Then it turns into a set of twisty passages that sometimes leads to a dead end and sometimes the passage opens up into a broad valley that you had not considered. 

One thing people need to learn is tolerance of ambiguity and to avoid demanding a simple ""right answer, now.""  

It is not chaos and just-my-opinion or anything goes.  There are general directions of accumulation of knowledge and people in the field can see what should happen.  It is not going to be instantaneous.  But it will happen."
2021-08-23 17:09:21,"The public debate on this issue has never been about scientific uncertainty; it has been about political tribalism as much as anything.  If this had ever been about scientific uncertainty, you wouldn't have the same people who are resistant to taking the vaccine jumping on the bandwagon of veterinary-grade Ivermectin.

The political right in this country has learned to gin up fake controversies because they considerable political mileage from doing so.  What is needed isn't so much new or better science education as much as education about propaganda techniques, and the ways in which politicians regularly exploit public fears and uncertainties."
2021-08-23 17:00:09,"As a physician leader, I can tell you that changing paradigms are a good thing. Doctors are accustomed to changing based on evidence. The pandemic is not even two years and we've learned far more than comparable diseases. Remember flu has been around for decades even as new strains evolve. We don't have good line-of-sight on many things and we need to change as the evidence changes. We have done so multiple times at my hospital and our patients are doing better as a result and we are more prepared for this new surge due to our reliance on data to drive our treatment.

The best evidence is medicine is a double-blinded, random, controlled trial. Observational data can be tricky in their are many biases in terms of your patient characteristics. But no one wants to leave a stone unturned in finding a better treatment. Once proning was found to be effective, we didn't want to wait to prone our patients for a double-blinded, random controlled trial and this saved a lot of lives. However, the lack of vigorous trials mean that sometimes we are going to reverse course.

Another thing most Americans forget is that we have dealt with this pandemic with limited resources. As an example, at the beginning there were not enough N95s or even surgical masks. Saving these for people in the closest contact also saved lives.

Sometimes the perfect is the enemy of the good."
2021-08-23 17:01:02,"Science indeed negotiates uncertainty, is evolving, and iterative. Public health is about choices based on overall analysis of costs and benefits to society as a whole. In case of vaccines and mask benefits outweigh costs/risks. Public heath communication is a challenge especially when it requires dealing with individual apprehensions. Transparency, credibility, and trust are still factors that foster confidence even when policy has to adjust to iterative nature of scientific understanding."
2021-08-23 17:07:44,"Medicine is not an exact science. There are no mathematical formulas as in physics or mechanics that can be predictive. Medicine is a science based on observations and clinical studies which are cumbersome and only give probabilities. The biology of life is incredibly complex and defies neat and exact modeling.  That’s why it takes 15 or more years of rigorous training to produce an MD , and even that seems inadequate. We have a long road ahead, and we don’t know what lies ahead with any certainty."

So maybe it’s the fault of underfunded & ignored health departments, including the CDC, that the public doesn’t understand science, even though she admits scientific research requires uncertainty. 

Or wait, maybe it’s inadequate education, because look how poorly our students do in science. Or …

Scientists cannot and ought not attempt to predict the future. They work through controlled examination of possibilities, hoping to find patterns. But many people refuse to acknowledge facts, or that experimentation is messy and complicated. They ignore disease & its consequences, ridicule simple prudent behavior, conflate public safety with infringement of their (imagined) rights, and pretend they know better than people who studied epidemiology for years, because their ‘brother knows a guy who…’. They probably didn’t do their science projects in school, or they’d know better.

Indoors is where the problems start. 2) The new Waterloo U. study tells us that cloth masks are only 10 percent effective against Delta, while KN95 and N95 are 50 percent effective. Stop the nonsense with requiring cloth masks, and crash-produce N95. This should have been done during the Trump administration, or on Day 1 of the Biden administration. It is a bipartisan failure. 3) Kids don't get Covid-19 much, and when they do, they recover well the vast majority of the time. Send them to school."

""The use of scientific jargon and community norms to cloak or hide a political, ideological, or financial agenda within the appearance of legitimate scientific research.

Government health agencies, mostly a fair job but with some glaring mistakes on masking.

All of us don't need to become professional epidemiologists or get whiplashed by every piece of breaking news. All we need to do is, get vaccinated, mask when indoors in a public environment or with people whose status is unknown. That hasn't changed since last spring when it became clear how the virus was transmitted."
2021-08-23 17:29:12,"What's missing in this article is the role of the press in all this--along with the average American's inability to read such information with discretion.  Yes, science moves slowly and not always in a straight line.  So, for the average person, it may seem like science and doctors don't know what they're doing and, thus, can't be trusted.  But the important point here is to understand that science is fluid and discoveries are alway subject to challenge and change when new information becomes available.  And that the press, trying to be ""balanced,"" often finds a scientist with a contrary view to criticize a current trend or discovery (which leads to even more confusion among the general public unable to discern a scientific disagreement from ignorance or even deceit).  Follow the best science at the time.  Allow stories to develop before jumping on or off of bandwagons.  And always remember, Covid is a public health crisis--not a political statement."
2021-08-23 17:34:37,"All of the health and other public officials, who blithely stated ""follow the science"" as they announced there newest and often contradictory guidelines, have done more to harm the publics perception of and trust in science than all of the vaccine (and global warming) skeptics could ever do.

At any given time ""science"" is not a set of irrefutable laws and facts, but represents the best guess on how to interpret huge amounts of often contradictory observations.

Newton's ""Laws"" were seen as absolute, until Einstein came along and established other hypotheses, which are still be tested and verified by experiments.

We all, but especially decision makers, must learn to deal with ""uncertainty"" and not pretend that we have absolute certainty about anything.

Another example is the blithe prediction that 75% vaccination rate will provide ""herd immunity"", when in reality this depends on the infectiousness of the virus, which we have seen increasing dramatically."

The prediction was that the virus would mutate and it did. The prediction was that the vaccine would reduce spread, illness and death, it id. The prediction now is that many, many children will be infected by the variant and a subset of these will require hospitalization and some will die. This is scientifically certain. The uncertainty is exactly how many. There will be other variants this is certain. Whether the variant s will have worse consequences is uncertain. 

This is normal science, uncertainty is baked into all scientific analyses."

A bacteria called H. Pylori. We started treating ulcers with antibiotics instead and that has been the standard for 20 years.

For instance, believing to this day, that Black people feel pain less than, say, Whites. 

Or denying that Helicobacter pylori(H. pylori) might spark ulcers.

That germs might cause disease . . . Ignaz Semmelweis, a Hungarian obstetrician working at the Vienna General Hospital (Allgemeines Krankenhaus) in 1847, noticed the dramatically high maternal mortality from puerperal fever following births assisted by doctors and medical students.

If journalists would remember that most Americans are functionally illiterate and write as though for 3rd graders maybe we wouldn't be in quite this situation.

The worst thing that comes out of this is people say ""they don't know anything"" when new things are learned. Everything is dismissed should a scientist say ""hang on, let me clarify"".  Just because the information has been updated, does not mean scientists’ credibility is shot. 

Science is about asking questions. It's always a learning process and that is what helps us solve and evolve. Reminds me of the story of cholera in London -- scientists in the 1800s thought it was a fog in the air. It took another scientist to look at the data from another angle and see that it was waterborne from contaminated drinking water. Once that foul well was sealed, people stopped dying. 

The blame for the average person thinking that science is a belief system or that they know more than a highly educated scientist falls squarely on dirty fossil fuel companies. Their decades-long campaign to challenge the scientists on climate change has delivered us into this zombie mob ignorance and paranoid distrust of good science. 

The fact that you don’t believe in climate change doesn’t make it any less a reality. The fact that you doubt the vaccine’s effectiveness doesn’t take away the fact that it has saved thousands of lives.

The Trump administration supercharged uncertainty by forcefully injecting politics into the CDC in the early days of the pandemic, when trust was essential. Much that was widely known by the public here in Thailand, such as evidence of the role of aerosols in transmitting the virus, was either ignored by the CDC or denied at the direction of Trump appointees.

Having had my first rare AI diagnosed at 21 in 1992 (which left me immune compromised), also prepared me for this moment. 

The silver lining to these rare health events has been my complete lack of need to buck over any of the news, or shifts in the news, around Covid. And to expect from the start that—as with seeking an initial diagnosis and later treatment for rare disorders—things would most definitely change as a slew of experts weighed in on what could possibly be wrong and what, of the myriad potential standard and experimental treatments, might be most effective at bringing relief, if not a total cure. 

When an infection can kill you in normal times, you have no qualms about listening to scientists and doctors from the start of a global pandemic. In fact, rather than doubts or libertarian obstinance over personal freedom, we immune compromised folks were inclined to take what was prescribed as initial safety precautions and double, or even triple, down on the methods we undertook to protect our lives from the start. 

In reading this piece I came to understand how blissfully free my husband and I have been from this two-steps-forward, ten-steps-backward dance others have engaged in for 18 months. We’ve happily been willing (extreme) wallflowers waiting for our chance to (safety) dance."

2021-08-23 18:07:05,"A principle from social psychology: The more uncertain a situation is, the more likely people are to seek and embrace explanations that they feel help them make sense of a confusing situation.

Another principle called the Thomas theorem: Situations defined as real, are real in their consequences. 

Put the two principles together, and we have (1) confused and anxious people seeking answers to uncertain situations, and (2) a set of other people, often in positions of authority and power, who eagerly provide explanations. 

But which authority's explanation each individual or group will accept depends on how each explanation is perceived and interpreted by individuals and groups. 

Science teaches us study and follow the facts and evidence, always recognizing that the acceptance of scientific findings depends on the reliability and validity of the methodology used. Evidence, data, a convergence of findings, science is a building process, and when events change, then the science tracks and follows.

Too complicated, too nuanced, too much uncertainty for a quick answer for most people, unless you are trained and educated in the sciences.

Easy out is religion: Simple answers. Put your life in the Lord's hands. Whatever happens is God's will and God's blessing or punishment. Do what religious authorities tell you. They have an inside track to the gods. Politicians and media celebs now play a similar game.

2021-08-23 18:14:35,"When I started my PhD program many years ago,  I expected it to be a difficult but steady road towards entitlement. Up until that point in my life, everything I learned in school was presented as facts---incontrovertible laws of the universe that should be understood or at least memorized. I anticipated my PhD program would be more of the same but my naivety was quickly dispelled. Science as it turns out is very messy and information is not merely true or false but exists on a spectrum of certainty. More importantly, to do science one has to be comfortable with the chaotic, uncertain, and often times contradictory nature of scientific discovery. The fact that theories are often proven wrong is not a flaw but a highly prized feature of the process.

Unfortunately, our education system over-sanitizes this process and inadvertently gives people a dangerous right/wrong view of the world. This type of categorical thinking is what leads people to masquerade their ignorance as common sense and equate it with rigorously determined scientific uncertainty. Even smart, highly educated people fall into this trap. 

My hope is that we will one day move past merely trusting the results of science to truly understanding the process. Until then, we will always be ill-prepared to handle fundamentally uncertain situations like this pandemic."
2021-08-23 18:15:14,"Certainly it is sad but true that most don't understand how science works.If they did they would understand that simple yes or no answers are not in the cards. In reality though, it is not the science, or the process of science, that most Americans see and hear. There is always a layer, or many layers, between the science and the public. Instead, it is conveyed through media filters, which summarize, simplify, and sometimes distort findings, and through the fraught and imperfect process of converting today's findings into tomorrow's public policies, which are in turn subject to further media interpretation."
2021-08-23 18:17:28,"When I was young, I was told the basis of an education is to basically distinguish what is true from what is essentially opinion. I'm afraid many Americans continue to flunk this test. We've grown accustomed to thinking that we can justify our opinions (""hypotheses"") and making them ""true"" by rejecting any contradictory observations.  The scientific method is the opposite; observations lead to the rejection of false hypotheses.  Too many politicians have convinced the public that we can invent ""truth."" COVID is a relatively new virus and it continues to evolve, so our knowledge is limited by our powers of observation and we still have much to learn. Unfortunately, the public is paying a high price for not accepting the scientific method."

Those who learn science and technology, today understand what is the knowledge provided by science and when knowledge comes directly from good guesses. What is science? It’s a process for determining reliable explanations of how the real world works from how the real world works. One begins with a logical proposition of how the world works, then one confirms the guess by collecting and analyzing facts to see if the proposition is proved right or more right than just a random guess. The goal of science is not to find absolute truths but reliable beset explanations.

Kurt Goedel spent his career addressing certainty and uncertainty. Had he lived in the Sixteenth century Europe, he’d have been risking his life. Today he just confuses. He proved that one of the foundations of rational argument was not what it seems, namely that sound logical reasoning based upon a set of sound axioms may not always produce the expected outcomes, that even with the most certain input uncertain outputs can be produced. 

Science can handle uncertainty but people who want to make decisions about what to do are frustrated by uncertainties."

2021-08-23 18:31:10,"What is the scientific method? Some say: double blinds, statistics? In truth, it’s not completely elucidated. The mRNA vaccine science was generally dismissed only a few years prior. Synthetic messenger RNA (mRNA) engineered by Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna use pseudouridine and 5-methyl cytidine as substitutions for uridine and cytidine to avoid the immune response and cytotoxicity induced by introducing mRNA into cells. MRNA not using these substitutions is less effective. However, the influence of base modifications on RNA is poorly understood. And so on.
The scientific method is common sense, applied to experiments (or thought experiments) it advances through debate. So debates, and the desire-to-debate should be promoted. The mRNA vaccines are working, it's likely that they will have little negative health impact... Differently from vaccines which modify the genetics. 
There is plenty of scientific evidence that masks are counterproductive... The virus is the same size as smoke (100 nanometers); dogs smell COVID at a distance: feeling protected by a thin material, people gather, and breathe the smoke/COVID. HEPA filtration and ventilation certainly work, should be enforced!

Maybe people would be less likely to follow honest advice than confident declarations, but confidence doesn't help if people don't trust you. The CDC, in particular, has been profoundly unhelpful.

When people accuse ""science"" of being uncertain, changing it's mind, far too many people treat science as they do religion. 

I.e., religion has a book that was set by the hand of God. Perfect. Immutable. Correct always. There is no doubt or question.  Religion also has time on its side. 

Science isn't like that. Postulating, understanding, changing, is part of science. When the old theory no longer fits the facts science must change. In religion that facts must change to fit doctrine. Change is built into science. Where hard core steadfast principles carved into tablets are the cornerstone of religion. Science is often expected to shrink time and eliminate uncertainty in a blink of an eye.

Here's the thing. People do understand science and rapidly changing conditions - when they want to. Really basic examples illustrate the point. 

Scientists create a weather forecast based on a weather model. Sometimes its right. Sometimes its wrong. When it is wrong we don't protest in the street.

It’s clear that at nearly every step decisions were made to minimize the pandemic and steps to safeguard. Need for masks, vaccinations, continued vigilance at virus ebbs, the emergence of more contagious or vaccine resistant strains were all predicted early on by experts. The rush to reopen with 50% vax rate and the emerging delta is the most recent example of policy that was not science driven. Public Health policy appeared to be driven by economics- but maybe economists could have been asked about the best ways to deal with good sense prescriptions rather than bending health policy. The same with education. If federal Ed planning in Summer 2020 was directed towards how to effectively deal with distance learning coupled with an effective vaccine campaign, then maybe we would be in a better place now. I hope that I am wrong but it seems likely that we will continue in pandemic mode until we achieve nearly universal vaccination.

2021-08-23 19:51:31,"Perfect example of how ""uncertainty"" can kill people: FDA approval. It's just not always based on sound science.

There isn’t a concrete definition for the term ""FDA approved""or a specific set of criteria that companies must meet to use the label. In fact, many times. Manufacturers who explicitly play up “FDA approved” labels may be doing so just to deceive you about the quality of their products.

Furthermore, the FDA never guarantees that a product is safe or effective – even if it is responsible for approving the product in the first place. Many drugs and medical devices have been fully approved and then later recalled for having put patients at risk for serious injury. 

Finally, the FDA bases its approvals on tests performed by manufacturers themselves. So, the studies that manufacturers perform may be biased or purposely isolated from other studies to meet a specific agenda, namely that their product is safe and effective and should be approved by the FDA.

Therefore, the phrase “FDA approved” – whether expressly stated or implied – may not carry as much weight as many believe, and a product can still be approved while there are still uncertainties about it. That potentially harms the public, and the process of fast-tracking drugs needs reform."

Most Leftists are in Group 1.  Most Rightists are in Group 3.  The majority of Americans who know how to separate science and politics are in Group 2.

Bottom line: The vaccines work. So-called breakthrough cases are mainly asymptomatic, with maybe 20% having mild symptoms (think cold) and 9% having nasty symptoms (think flu). less than 1% are hospitalized/dead and they are almost all elderly and/or already quite sick from other things.

The vaccinated should not wear masks or social distance, because they need exposure to the virus to ensure their bodies know how to react to it and future mutations. The only reason for them to wear masks is to protect others who are unvaccinated, and since almost all those people are so by choice, they are really not our responsibility to protect. Just as it is not my concern if you choose to ride a motorcycle, sky dive, play professional football, etc.

2021-08-24 02:42:33,"It's interesting how many comments are on the theme that science can't deliver certainty, no knowledge is absolute, everything is subject to revision. True.

And yet, here I sit on my back porch, routing my words through a wafer of silicon and bouncing them off of a satellite, so they might appear on your screen, wherever in the world you may be."
2021-08-24 03:04:13,"Most commenters express:
1) Satisfaction with being superior to ""them.""
2) Perplexity about what to do with ""them.""

No comment proposes a solution for ""them."" But it's just below the surface of nearly every comment.

If you can't QUITE get there, then why not give Ms. Mandavilli's approach a chance?

Who knows what historic or evolutionary purpose was served by personalities that respond better to fluid suggestions offered with humility than fluctuating dicta from lofty experts?

My favorite example: 
Would a video* illustrating germ spread, even a bit wryly,* have worked better than a rigid ""do/don't"" list?  Were service spots for ""the masses"" dumbed down to the point of being insulting? Might a discussion of a ""kit of parts"" (masks, soap, distance, gestures, etc.) have been engaging?

*In an old Robitussin TV commercial the kids duck Dad's green germ cloud in the family SUV.  The sponsor paid good money to put this image into people's heads. Why? 
Friends in ""the biz"" assure me that similar spots were run for Covid, but given the lamentable amount of time our TV is on, I'd have seen them.

I'm glad that Doctor Dave Chakshi is loosening up, but why aren't the Yanks and Knicks (well, maybe the Nets) getting their shots on TV?"
2021-08-24 02:29:43,"Excellent article. I try to teach this in my environmental chemistry courses, but it is challenging, especially for students not majoring in the sciences.  

My only suggestion for the article is to note that other fields besides biology and medicine are particularly challenging."
2021-08-24 02:39:22,"Speaking as a research biologist, I don't think it's reasonable to blame scientists for the lack of understanding of the scientific process shown by the public.  I have attended many online research talks by scientists working on the virus, and I have never heard anyone express certainty about the course of the pandemic.  How could they?  As fast as scientists come to understand one variant, a new mutation arises.  We should recognize and be grateful for the incredible speed with which  scientists have understood how the virus infects cells, which viral proteins are required for infection, and how to stimulate our immune systems to develop antibodies against those proteins.  mRNA vaccine technology was entirely experimental when the pandemic began, and it is amazing that it was exploited to develop successful vaccines at a global scale within one year.  In 35 years as a working scientist, I've never seen any field progress this fast.
    Confusion and mixed messaging has come more from the conflicting goals of public health agencies, politicians, and the media.  Public health must balance the science with the various goals of politicians and the media.  Most politicians have little knowledge about or patience for the usual deliberate pace of science, balancing economic and political pressures with the guidance from public health.  Throw in demagogic Republicans who politicize the virus and it's no surprise that we find ourselves in this morass."
2021-08-24 03:09:08,"Splendid piece, thank you.

The word uncertainty from the outset gifted the writing zing.

As a boy elders might admonish me or anyone my age and interests with 'a little knowledge is a dangerous thing.'

Fortunately I paid them little heed, preferring to see 'little' as part of a larger scene. Building knowledge was thereby a long road to fruition. But, as Sinatra would sing, it was my way.

Am saying this because what science needs most in order to influence today's world is another word. One which uncertainty would gladly add to further its own course: Trust.

I think the same could be said of that certainty non-science minded people have. For their certainty is not the opposite of uncertainty as you and I are using it, but the certainty of belief, and presupposed beliefs.

Trust in co-existence has example, as believers and none believers alike do not poke fingers into live power sockets."

We are not into the gamesmanship of before."
2021-08-20 13:10:29,"In world opinion, it will take China decades to recover from unleashing a second deadly coronavirus in less than 20 years. It is unconscionable that, after SARS, the country did not clean up its fetid wet markets and ban the consumption of certain known virus-carrying animals.

I know China trumpets its modernization but how can you be ""modern"" if you can't get food safety, personal hygiene, and basic medicine right? 

Saving face, Asians will tell you, is the governing dynamic of their cultures. China knows it cannot ""save face"" over Covid, thus its aggressive, bullying posture in so many other areas.

2021-08-20 14:10:18,"Grateful my in-laws and elderly relatives in Vietnam got the mRNA vaccines. 

The distrust of China in Vietnam is not a product of the US or American press (and it's extremely self-centered and West-centric of commenters to even think it might be). It goes back for a thousand years, due to repeated Chinese invasion and domination of Vietnam. That Vietnamese people distrusted the Chinese vaccines is a reflection of centuries of issues between the countries, growing ties between ASEAN countries and the West (to balance Chinese imperialism and continued attempted seizure of their land and sea resources), and, of course, poor data on the efficacy of the Chinese vaccines."
2021-08-20 14:48:01,It would be nice if the article gave more info on how  people who took  the chinese vaccines fared when infected. We have seen people here in the US who are vaccinated become infected but usually have a mild case of covid. What has been the case with the vaccines from China?

China had distributed 770 million vaccines outside of China and at the same time administered 1.9 billion to its own population since January 2021, that’s more than half of the entire vaccines in the world. There is no doubt many lives were saved. 

Japan just had a research that the Pfizer vaccines were only 42% effective with delta variant. When Pfizer conducted its 3rd trails the new variant wasn’t there, so it’s high efficacy rate is uncertain in dealing with new variant. Even it has higher efficacy but it’s unlikely it’d be widely available. Any vaccine is better than no vaccine."

Very interesting logic, hard to believe how low NY times can get in order to attack China. By politicizing the Covid-19 internationally, the media has been responsible for the trend of politicizing the virus within our country; that's one of the main reasons why a large percentage of many red states refused to be vaccinated, because internationally or nationally COVID-19 is not a scientific issue but a political issue. The two authors must be blind: in your own paper, US got more than 14 thousands confirmed and 911 dead yesterday alone. Is this because Americans used Chinese vaccines? Trump has been doing it since the beginning, I thought that Times must have slightly higher level than the former president; but obviously I was wrong."

China has been shipping out nearly half of the vaccines it has produced while the US is hogging billions of doses, and only now starting to send out a few million.  We are still doing the Trump's bidding about ""America First"", but this is a wrong-headed and stupid way to deal with the pandemic, as everything going on in this world is coming to bite us sooner or later."

2021-08-20 15:18:55,"Although China has the world’s second largest economy and aims to conquer the world of technology, its pharma industry doesn’t have the decades old of experience and the reputation that its Western counterpart enjoys. The country needs to know the limits of ity hybrid economic model of state capitalism. Money alone can’t buy goodwill and the talent needed to lead in science and medicine. 
Western pharma companies, despite fierce competition, do cooperate. Vaccines like Pfizer BioNtech, Moderna, Johnson & Johnson and others are the fruits of global cooperation. Chinese vaccine manufacturers rely mainly on domestic R&D, withholding data concerning the origin of Covid-19, hoping to make ground-breaking discovery and reap the gains and claim credit."

This is not ""Hoarding"", this is ""Fairness"", plain and simple.

The Western countries that developed these vaccines rapidly began to send them to less developed nations as soon as possible, which is quite charitable in my estimation.

Does Ms. Noor have a chip on her shoulder regarding the West? Sounds like it to me."

Indonesia even prepared to manufacture Sinovac vaccine locally going forward. Because we cannot rely on Pfizer and Moderna. Indonesia ordered (not asked) every vac right from the start, only China and AZ delivered in meaningful amount. 
Pfizer and Moderna WILL CONTINUE to not deliver any significant amount. US and UK doing booster shots, other countries will get bumped down even further. We have no illusions regarding our place in their priority list.

And the writers must know this. Numbers do not lie, and have no geopolitical or corporate agenda.

The thing is, many, including myself, are willing to accept that Pfizer and Moderna maybe more effective. But our concern is not acknowledging the BEST vaccine. We are trying to save lives of our people. Chinese vaccines provides some/adequate/moderate protection from hospitalizations and deaths. That is enough. However fewer lives they saved, they are more that the vaccines that out of our reach. 

Also, @NYTimes: Why is it ok for your writers to play anti-vax rubbish in other countries?"

Today, Mongolia's cases has dropped by half, and only 2 or 3 people actually die from COVID each day.

When this journalist questioned China's control on COVID in early August, when China had witness a small surge of dozens of domestic cases per day, indicated that China might need to learn to live with COVID.

Today, only three weeks after the breakout, the domestic cases dropped back to only 4-5 domestic cases per day, with none died of COVID.

Today, when this article celebrates that US vaccine will gain a new market opening, it fails to recognize that with the majority of the country being vaccinated, US still sees dramatic increase in COVID cases with deaths rise back to almost 1000 per day."

However, those posts that criticize the US for not shipping more abroad fail to consider the amount of the virus circulating here and the need to get the pandemic under control while political conditions continued to be volatile with a  maniac former guy hanging around mucking things up even more.

President Biden has done an outstanding job on almost all areas considering the messes he was handed.  Though I have severe concerns in one area I will not mention, nevertheless, I am in awe of his talents, goodness, knowledge and energy and especially his ability to present a sense of calm in tumultuous waters.  

Never before, in my lifetime and probably never, has a President had to govern with a mad dog sniffing at his heels.

Stability here at home was an overarching concern and I would say the UK may have, in its vaccine contributions, had another motive, too, to distract from the upheavals of Brexit, I don't know.

...but I do know that I pray every day to the God of ""all"" to keep him safe and well served by his Cabinet and Chief of Staff, Ron Klain.

That is how local knowledge of the presence the Covid19 virus did not become known to the people in the highest levels until the only way to control the spread was by using draconian measures.
It is reasonable to assume that people involved in the Chinese clinical trails knew exactly what data their superiors wanted and so that is what was sent to them.
Trump never wanted to hear news that was not good for him and that is one reason, in addition to incompetence at the CDC, that the US was very late in having an accurate point of service test for the virus."

By focusing on scapegoating China, we have on both conscious and unconscious levels reinforced the perception of China as ""other"". I believe that this has been part of the reason that our response has been so delayed and inadequate. Remember the ""relief"" when this hit Italy because then we would get some ""real"" information and see how a modern Western nation could successfully deal with Covid without resorting to the ""draconian"", ""totalitarian"" and ""Maoist"" strategies employed by China. Then to our astonishment and horror, we saw this thing literally steamroll Italy. Oops. It really doesn't matter what China publicly said, they gave us a step by step playbook of how to handle this. What they did to contain and mitigate was literally visible by satellite and based on sound reasoning and science. If we did not see them as ""other"" we would have appreciated the severity of the threat sooner and would have followed their, now proven, strategies.

I don't think there's anything wrong with a structured 'vaccine diplomacy', ie, getting something in return from vaccine donations overseas.

A bunch of studies published on respectable websites have pretty much confirmed that Delta circumvents protections offered by vaccines - whether they are Astra Zeneca (Covidshield in India), Moderna, Sputnik or, in this case, Sinovac.

Thumping your chests and saying “China vaccine baaaad” rings hollow when the US itself is seeing a bunch of breakthrough infections for folks who were given supposedly ‘superior’ vaccines."
2021-08-20 17:49:46,"No mention of how Beijing has held up doses of Pfizer vaccine to Taiwan, an independently governed island."
2021-08-20 18:57:42,"It's shameful that we would be considering a third shot before much of the world has even had a chance of the first. If you consider the additional protection conveyed by the  third shot as opposed to the first, it becomes obscene."
2021-08-20 21:33:58,"China used Sinovac and sinopharma
vaccines exclusively. There is no
outbreak on a large scale there.
They have to be effective. Pfizer
vaccine also loses effectiveness after
couple of months. This is the reason
for booster shot. Most vaccines 
initially tested on original version
of Covid-19 are less effective against
delta variant. Astra Zeneca and J&J
vaccines have caused blood clot in
some cases. US has paused J&J vaccine
here."
2021-08-20 21:35:50,"When AZ and Pfizer’s vaccines were not available to those countries in January 2021 and still not, it’s no brainer that the Chinese vaccines with its efficacy in the 70% to 80% range beat 199% of nothing!"
2021-08-20 22:01:56,"This is depressing to read for only one reason: the people are so easily manipulated by mass media. 

The US is seeing a mass increase in infection. The death numbers are climbing. And the government is offering a booster shot. This is clear evidence that you can't easily correlate case number with the efficacy of the vaccines. Yet, no one in these countries can get pass the fear instilled by the misinformation spread by the mass media.  

Informed constituency clearly is a fantasy .This pandemic reveals so many problems in democracy on so many levels."
2021-08-20 21:17:38,"So there is an opening for the US in the Vaccine area. But knowing the management of the present government, watch them blow it. They will wait till the last minute.  And  then wait some more, till the opening closes. My god I wanted  so much Biden to be successful. If they could not make their own deadline in Afghanistan, set by them,  announced  by them, what are the chances they will be successful  when there is no deadline? They should be handing over the patent of those vaccines if that was a free candy. They should be helping those countries who have the capacity to manufacture those free vaccines. It will not only help the world, it will help the US by not producing any more variants."
2021-08-20 21:56:30,The Pfizer Moderna and J&J vaccines are quite efficacious against the original and other variants including Delta variant against severe disease and death. The Delta variant is not passive stupid protoplasmic microorganism. It seeks unvaccinated and less vaccine protected higher protoplasmic folks to propagate replicate and mutate to more virulent variant. I would think twice to receive Sinovac or Sputnik V.
2021-08-20 23:38:58,"Nothing more than propaganda. The effectiveness/ineffectiveness of Sinovac vaccine have been questioned by US mouthpieces since the very beginning. Clinical trials have showed it to be about as effective as the 2 popular American alternatives but do a simple search online and half the articles are by American or pro-US factions questioning Sinovac.

It’s really a sad day when America sees the only wait to gain on China is for China to stumble. You don’t think people in other countries noticed this change in status?"
2021-08-20 23:08:33,"What about sub Saharan Africa?  We promised them million of doses: have delivered less than 1 million. No excuse for hoarding doses that, by the way, are expiring.  Let’s start an airlift to African capitals."
2021-08-20 19:50:58,"How does China play vaccine diplomacy? Ask Taiwan, who China has been blocking from buying European vaccines and trying to force them to buy Sinopharm and SinoVac. When Japan sent 1.2 million AstraZeneca doses to Taiwan China told Japan to stop “meddling in China’s internal affairs”. When America sent 2.5 million doses to Taiwan, China's Global Times newspaper told America to ""mind its own business and stop interfering""."
2021-08-20 18:56:09,"First they get you sick, then they sell you vaccinations with low efficacy rates. What a business model!"
2021-08-21 02:53:10,"This article reads like Gordon Chang's infamous book so many years ago: ""The Coming Collapse of China.""

South China Morning Post reported today that China's leading respiratory disease expert Zhong Nanshan says more than 80 per cent of China's population is expected to be fully vaccinated by year end 2021. That could be the threshold for herd immunity after factoring in the effectiveness of the vaccines used. If herd immunity is reached, Chinese citizens can resume living ""normal"" life and covid-19 can be regarded in the same manner as the seasonal flu.

The proof of China's vaccine effectiveness will be reflected in the number of covid-19 patients requiring hospital admission and fatality data. No vaccine is perfect. Since Chinese vaccines are not used in the US and so far China is only using home-grown vaccines, a comparison of severe covid-19 cases and fatality figures in 2022 and will be most revealing about the effectiveness of the various vaccines in question.​"
2021-08-20 18:36:28,"This is the problem with totalitarian regimes: there is no one who has the nerve to tell the leaders that they are going about things the wrong way.  

China wants desperately to one up the USA, so the regime rushes to develop substandard vaccines.   But its just not possible to outdo the US, as we have the best minds in the world living and working here.  

Incidentally, is there a word in Chinese for ""quality control""?"
2021-08-19 09:48:25,"""federal officials are clearly racing against the clock to offer extra shots before those who were vaccinated earliest could be more vulnerable to the threat of severe disease.""

This certainly seems to say that the waning of the vaccine is complete, i.e., that it will (at least potentially) stop doing what it was ""intended"" to do, prevent severe disease and hospitalization. In that case, the booster starts to seem less like a booster for added protection and more like a re-vaccination because the 1st one lasted only 8 months. The point is confusing. We do have vaccines (flu), which are done yearly. There were questions last year about whether Covid would follow that pattern, but unlike flu, Covid is not really a seasonal virus. We at least need a full year's protection. 

As to the morality of boosters here when the rest of the world is not vaccinated: Sounds like a valid concern, except Americans getting more shots is not the issue in the rest of the world. The supply is being sent. Issues everywhere are infrastructure (everything from clinics and transportation to refrigeration), vaccine hesitancy, and lack of information."
2021-08-19 07:44:18,"Perhaps the critics of the booster shot policy should read the Times' article on Israel's experience and return to a highly vaccinated country experiencing a disturbing surge in the pandemic . . . . I can understand the global aspect of the criticism but not the argument that ""the policy [i]s overly broad, . . . it is not clear that the general population needs a third shot."""
2021-08-19 08:02:35,I am tired of catering to the unvaccinated. They are immovable even in disease. Give me my third shot if it may prevent me from giving this nasty virus to my infant who has no opportunity to be vaccinated. Give me the third shot and charge the unvaccinated more for insurance and prevent them from traveling by plane or train and keep them out of public areas as much as possible. It is only fair.
2021-08-19 09:18:38,"The Republican war on masking is so cynical. They don’t want Biden to succeed and are willing to sacrifice their own voters to sow chaos.

I really hope this backfires on republicans but I am not sure it will.  

I work with many people from Texas and Florida and Georgia who are not vaccinated and refuse to wear a mask and then tell me they can’t make forecast because a few of their sales people are in hospital with covid."
2021-08-19 10:06:50,"The article says that the Biden admin is “strongly recommending booster shots for most vaccinated American adults”. Then below it says that first the FDA must authorize 3rd doses, and the CDC must review the evidence, but “neither Pfizer nor Moderna has yet submitted all the necessary data showing that third shots are safe and effective.” Why recommend boosters if there’s yet no necessary safety & efficacy data from the drug manufacturers?"
2021-08-19 10:10:12,"I would like to see any booster shot contain a cocktail of all the current variants that are circulating, rather than the same shot I have already received."
2021-08-19 10:15:45,"For a number of years I have served on our local hospital’s Advisory Council.  My working years have all been in healthcare.  I worked as an RN in numerous settings and took on a number of roles, now retired.

Yesterday I sent a letter of resignation to our local hospital’s administrator.  Why?  Because I witnessed, on August 17th, some of our local hospital nurses, RN’s, walking and participating in a protest in our town.  They were advocating for citizens to NOT get COVID vaccinations.  

This action turned my stomach. They had their children with them, all ages.  No one wore a mask.  They laughed and cajoled as if walking in a jolly Christmas parade.  

Hundreds of thousands of citizens have perished from COVID.  Healthcare workers are exhausted with their fight of COVID.  They have given their all time and again.  They have gotten sick themselves.  They have sacrificed.  

It is understandable that there are concerns regarding vaccinations. On the other hand, is it appropriate for hospital workers to publicly protest against vaccination? To top this off, our local sherif was one of the protest ringleaders!  

Science knows most of the COVID patients now in hospitals are unvaccinated. Children are going to be starting school. Should we expect our youth to unnecessarily and purposely be exposed to those who purposely refuse to vaccinate?  

Yes, we have freedoms here in the United States. But what about protection? Innocent kids missing protection due to adults?  Unfair."
2021-08-19 08:26:03,"""Fauci ... said studies had shown that third shots of the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines could boost the levels of antibodies that fight the virus tenfold""
That comment lacks context - tenfold increase against what? Levels just before third dose was administered, that have been waning for months already, or levels just after second dose? If former, how does it stack up against original vaccination?"
2021-08-19 09:31:21,"Instead of infections (positive test) I would really like to see numbers of hospitalizations, severe covid19, deaths among both groups. Somehow these numbers are never presented in the reporting."
2021-08-19 12:07:55,"If all our government does is give boosters to Americans every eight months until the next election, the pandemic will not come close to going away.  Remember the goal:  70 percent of the world must be fully vaccinated to create any kind of herd immunity.  If all that happens is the same 50 percent of Americans who are vaccinated now being given boosters over and over again, it is no progress at all."
2021-08-19 09:38:27,"I think it is time to start using the ""E-Word"" -- ENDEMIC.

I'm not a medical professional but I see the evidence and I recognize that SARS-Co-V2 is here to stay like a host of other viral agents. That means at least annual vaccinations to keep the immune systems in top condition, practical precautions against spreading the latest variant, and most important - ""This is not a drill."" This is real, life threatening and it is not going to magically disappear. COVID and all of the protocols are now a part of human life.

It is past time for adult humans to start acting like adults instead of tantrum obsessed children who don't like being told to do things that they don't like or want to hear. 

It's also past time for America to reconsider the preference for medical care that is driven by profit maximization over the need for general public health - which is also a matter of national security when you think about it."
2021-08-19 11:15:26,"A related article today states that “If preventing infection is the goal, it would be wiser to develop a booster of a nasal spray vaccine, which is better at inducing immunity in the nose and throat, where the virus enters the body”. 
An expert states that being “sick as a dog” in bed is preferable to being hospitalized.

Another article speculates that those of us who got the J&J vaccine *might* be offered a booster sometime, though only a booster of the J&J vaccine is likely to be tested and therefore offered.

First of all, I will acknowledge that the vaccines might be efficacious at preventing hospitalization or death. However, I think the J&J vaccine should have only been offered to people where the other vaccines could not be safely distributed, and to those unable or unwilling to get vaccinated twice. 

And secondly, if I have to accept a higher risk of illness or death for the foreseeable future, I will be even more depressed than I am today. 

If there is a likelihood that the mRNA boosters will be unsafe or not permitted for those who got the J&J vaccine, tell us now. Don’t just say that data is forthcoming… some day."
2021-08-19 09:51:21,We would not be in this situation if people got the initial two shot regimen.  Delta has spread like wildfire throughout the USA because of vaccine refusal.
2021-08-19 11:34:29,"I read the most recent study that the J and J's efficacy increased and was higher at 8 months than at one.  Earlier reports say that it isn't effective against Delta.  What is true?
I personally believe that J and J didn't win the PR competition.  The first prize went to Pfizer."
2021-08-19 12:24:14,"Excellent. Anyone refusing vaccinations, without a valid MEDICAL excuse, has no business working with patients, requiring physical contact.   Period. 
   Vendors, repairpersons, etc. servicing facilities must be vaccinated and masked.  Same with Visitors.
   This ain’t over, folks.  And it won’t be, as long as fools are allowed their “ freedom “. 
   If you don’t care enough about our population to get vaccinated, I don’t care about you.
   Seriously."
2021-08-19 12:24:41,"We routinely roll out annual vaccines for “seasonal flu” - another viral antagonist.

We routinely get booster shots for Tetanus.

We get three separate vaccinations against Hepatitis. (They are REQUIRED for teachers. Why shouldn’t those for Covid and the wearing of masks be required too?)

There is absolutely nothing different in the concept of receiving boosters for Covid - - - NOTHING!!

As soon as boosters are available for people of my age in the general population - - I’M THERE.

I’m tired of hearing about the oppositional thinking of “some experts” and “some doctors” - - and bone weary about hearing anything at all from the Governors of Florida and Texas (in particular).

And, finally, I give NO credence to the suggestion that the US should withhold boosters because other countries haven’t managed to make use of first-round vaccines that are available to them. We are not the world’s policeman - nor are we its “mommy”."
2021-08-19 09:38:05,How about mandatory vaccinations for ALL teachers. How better to protect the vulnerable children 5-12?
2021-08-19 09:36:03,For 12 months I have been saying to withhold all government benefits to anyone in a nursing home employee who has not been vaccinated. Now I would say if you don’t get a shot you get fired without unemployment benefits. Yiu have ine week to get vaccinated or face the consequences.

2021-08-19 12:02:45,"COVID will get worse this winter, unless herd immunity is achieved this fall.
The only way that will happen is if children can get immunized.  The #1 priority should be approval of one of the COVID vaccines for children ASAP, and encouraging all children to get it."
2021-08-19 12:07:33,We wouldn't have need boosters if the antivaxxers had gotten the vaccine. Just wait for the new variant these tragic people spurn onto the rest of us. Vaccine passports and restrictions for those unvaccinated should be implemented now. Stop the nonsense!
2021-08-19 12:44:11,"good...requiring vaccinations is good.      

Question to NYTimes, is there a checklist for the FDA for their full approval of the Phizer.   Has FDA completed 80% or 90% or 95% of tasks to issue approval.    What is scheduled timeline for completion?   Any competent organization would have a schedule - lets hold the FDA accountable"
2021-08-19 13:09:07,"I’m afraid the news about the need for a booster will only give the unvaccinated one more argument against the vaccines’ effectiveness.

We simply cannot count on enough of our fellow citizens to do the right thing for all of us in the U.S.  And some of our public officials in states like South Carolina, Florida and Texas will continue to pander to the misinformed, the underinformed, the ignorant and partisan extremists. What's just as bad is that they disregard the advice of their own state's health experts. The courts may offer us some protection. South Carolina's Supreme Court just overruled the SC governor and state legislature and as a result the University of South Carolina and Clemson Univ and Furman and The Citadel and College of Charleston etc. can now mandate masks for students. The faculty said they teach science and are going to abide by it."

Lack of respect , inadequate pay and high personal risk are leaving our nursing homes already understaffed. It is safer to work at Walmart for the same or better pay. Withholding funding will make staffing crisis worse and leave residents at even greater risk. We need to our think of another way to appeal to people to get vaccinated."
2021-08-19 13:56:35,"I was shocked to find out that approx  1 in 3 Hosptial workers (doctors and nurses) in a large healthcare system found in seven states are not vaccinated. This after all employees were offered the vaccine in JANUARY. 
We have no problem mandating and imposing restrictions on women’s access to reproductive healthcare, why  is it so uncomfortable to mandate vaccines?"
2021-08-19 13:37:50,shame on the unvaccinated!  this new surge didn't have to happen if all got vaccinated.  I am an RN and I truly believe the unvaccinated are responsible for the pregnant women in the ICU who were unable to get the vaccine during pregnancy.  they are undergoing c-sections while unconscious and intubated.  I would hope someone could think of others instead of only themselves! This did not have to happen this way!
2021-08-19 13:13:30,"'his administration would make employee vaccination a condition for nursing homes to receive Medicare and Medicaid funding. Officials said the decision would affect more than 15,000 nursing homes that employ 1.3 million workers.'

Bravo.

I recall the recent story about two South Dakota nursing home residents who were fully vaccinated but died after getting COVID from a caregiver at that facility who was not vaccinated.

I find it incredulous that ANYONE working with the most vulnerable individuals such as the elderly in nursing home facilities would still choose to not be vaccinated.  How is that NOT criminal behavior?  And what are these nursing homes thinking by continuing to employee individuals who are not vaccinated?

Those two deaths were preventable ones.

Incredibly selfish and hurtful behavior."

We can't control politics, money (employers fear antagonizing employees), or ignorance. Some people's minds are made up and won't listen. What is required is political courage to mandate vaccines to enjoy the privilege of being a citizen. The FAA can mandate masks for planes (it has) and it can do the same for vaccines (it hasn't). States, if they want to help can mandate masks for schools and nursing homes and hospitals and restaurants. Leadership. That's what is needed most of all. It requires sticking your neck out. That's what the word leader means."

This is a global pandemic wherein the Coronavirus is constantly mutating especially in largely unvaccinated third world countries. This means that the vaccinated USA (you and me) will always be vulnerable to variants from those countries. WHO and the USA need to create vaccine production facilities in or close to those countries in order to enable them to vaccinate their populations. Otherwise the pandemic will continue to threaten our health despite any population booster project here. The decision should not be considered as either us or them."

Talk about back-sliding!

2021-08-18 13:18:36,"This article was confusing and more than a bit frustrating. 

First, these articles need to reinforce the difference between the mortality rate for unvaccinated people versus vaccinated people --- assuming that disparity is still large, it needs to be emphasized every time so that more people get vaccinated (and soon for vaccinated people to want to get boosters).  Otherwise, people may think the vaccine isn't effective against Delta and will think ""why bother."" 

Second, if there is definitive data on rising breakthrough hospitalizations and deaths because of the Delta variant, make it clearer in a chart or graph and maybe compare it with the average flu season.  

So combining points one and two, give us an easy-to-understand graph showing chances of hospitalization/death due to Covid with vaccine, without vaccine, and compared to average flu season."

Getting the shot requires an actual decision and actual action, both are anathema for this group and if they can avoid the decision by believing any reason, they will continue to do it regardless of the outcome! 

It seems that the real question though, is why are their leaders in the religious and political circles feeding and encouraging them to NOT be vaccinated and thereby placing their lives and their families lives in imminent danger?

2021-08-18 13:20:26,"This information is consistent with an analysis I did of one day's case increases in one North American jurisdiction for several days ago. In that jurisdiction, there were 523 new cases, of which 17% were breakthrough infections amongst fully vaccinated adults. The data didn't inform on the seriousness of those infections and how many of them ended-up in the hospital, but it does indicate a vaccine effectiveness of about 83% in preventing infection. Most of those vaccinated would have been given an mRNA vaccine. It is a sample of one jurisdiction in one day, so caution on that front, but I was struck how close it is to the results reported in this article in terms of proportions of breakthrough infections."
2021-08-18 13:20:31,"The US has made several mistakes: (1) relying on vaccination alone to stop the spread of COVID, while knowing many would refuse to get vaccinated; (2) removing mask requirements for the vaccinated, while knowing the unvaccinated would also unmask; (3) not doing everything we could to help poorer countries get vaccines, while knowing that protecting the entire globe protects ourselves.  

But maybe since the outcome of these mistakes was predictable, they weren't mistakes, and just a cynical ploy to get ""the economy"" up and running again, put all blame on the unvaccinated for any problems (by the way, did you know that children *can't* be vaccinated yet?), and then tell people we just have to get used to COVID.  The alternative is to set a precedent for the government actually helping its citizens, and we can't have that."

I don't see how 18-28% can be considered ""extremely rare.""

I wish the C.D.C. would stop issuing statements like that because their messaging continues to be confusing and almost contradictory to other data as it become available

But in the end, I completely agree that this pandemic WILL be considered and remembered as  “a pandemic of the unvaccinated"" as well as ""the vaccine is tremendously successful and protective.""

2021-08-18 13:26:14,"Articles like this help to spreed hesitation among unvaccinated, as the most important facts are hidden deeply in the text (and most people usually don't read much past the headlines) like these: vaccinated people usually get very mild from of Covid, no more serious than a common flu, and almost never a terminal one. Yes, true, people die from common flu too, but, come on, we don't require distancing, masks, and remote work, etc. during flu season! It is headlines like this one help to limit number of vaccinated people."
2021-08-18 13:26:33,"The picture in this article shows 2 people in an indoor space registering for vaccination and not wearing their masks properly! It has been over a year and a half, when are people going to learn?"
2021-08-18 13:27:59,"""The states’ numbers come with many caveats. Immunized adults greatly outnumber unvaccinated adults in most states, and their ranks are growing by the day. So the proportional representation of the vaccinated among cases, hospitalizations and deaths would also be expected to rise.""

And the devil is in those caveats. Teasing out the actual trends from these numbers requires expert statistical analysis and a useful article for popular consumption will reflect that analysis. 

I want to see that."
2021-08-18 13:29:26,"My experience is that there is a strong resistance, even among those who previously strictly to covid precautions, to going back to wearing masks and avoiding socializing.  This information needs to be passed on to friends and family, and we need to lead by example."
2021-08-18 13:29:36,"I keep wondering about the people with only one shot. Why?
The disparity between the fully vaccinated and those with only one shot varies widely among states. I have never seen this discussed anywhere, and it is at least 10% nationwide."
2021-08-18 13:32:18,"My outrage is that the state where I live, Florida,  doesn’t care enough about breakthrough cases to collect the data.  Over the weekend, my 84-year-old husband started coughing, and on Monday he went for a test.  We are waiting for the results.  He took his vaccination card with him, but the staff at the testing center wasn’t interested.  So he’ll only join the breakthrough statistics if he ends up hospitalized.

I guess I shouldn’t be surprised."
2021-08-18 13:32:30,"Can anyone explain why President Biden doesn't institute a mask mandate for K-12 schools receiving federal funds? That is, any school receiving federal funds of any sort must mandate masks. Does the White House not have the authority? Genuine question."
2021-08-18 13:37:55,"Your headline is not helpful in explaining what is happening.  As more people get vaccinated with a vaccine that was never expected to prevent infection and is good but not perfect in preventing serious illness, the proportion of cases among the vaccinated is bound to rise.  I refer readers to this excellent explanation: <a href=""https://medium.com/@mattpfox/we-are-seeing-more-cases-of-covid-19-in-people-who-got-vaccinated-727a6b468468"" target=""_blank"">https://medium.com/@mattpfox/we-are-seeing-more-cases-of-covid-19-in-people-who-got-vaccinated-727a6b468468</a>. I do not mean to imply that increasing numbers of breakthrough infections are of no matter...only that a sensationalist and misleading headline doesn't help."
2021-08-18 13:39:12,"Everyone in my family was vaccinated with either the Pfizer or Moderna vaccines. Despite this, four of us recently tested positive for COVID. We all became ill. One member of my family has been hospitalized."
2021-08-18 13:40:29,"It's hard to believe just a few months ago the CDC said fully vaccinated people could safely gather indoors together without wearing a mask.  I've been supsicious of the claim that breakthrough cases are rare for a while now. While my experience is only anecdotal and not based on peer-reviewed data, I know far too many people who are fully vaccinated and have gotten sick.  How many more do I know that would have tested positive but never got sick?"
2021-08-18 13:41:20,"I don't know about my fellow human beings around the world but I am so dizzy from the talk of breakthrough cases, unvaccinated vs. vaccinated, etc.  As calantir, usa said below, mistakes have been made.  I add to that, hard to back pedal now.  Containing this pandemic could not be dependent on one things; it had to be a combination of several.  Many states in the USA should not have ripped off the masks until there was a higher vaccination rate.  50% is fairly low in a country so big.  Ireland has 80% and we are still struggling with Delta.  So many countries around the world are still in the single digits of vaccinations.  I am afraid that Covid will be with us for a while longer.  It's come to the point that one feels they cannot have a sniffle, ache or pain, without fearing they have Covid.  Not a great way to live!!!!"
2021-08-18 13:41:34,"The important words to remember in evaluating ""breakthrough"" cases in the vaccinated is that these cases will happen (no vaccine is 100% effective) and that these cases are few compared to the cases in the unvaccinated. The unvaccinated are most likely the reason for the emergence of these more infective variants and are the ones who will suffer far more severe illnesses. In short, getting vaccinated and continuing to practice masking and social distancing are still the more important means of keeping safe; keeping children who can't be vaccinated, safe. There are going to be breakthrough infections in vaccinated people but we as physicians are in a far better place in terms of monitoring and preventing severe illness in people who are vaccinated. Will some vaccinated people die? Yes, but very, very few. We will continue to study and update recommendations in terms of this ever-changing virus but people need to be proactive about protecting themselves and those who need to be protected. We can't force people to be safe (same as we can't stop drunk drivers from killing innocent people) but we can be as vigilant as possible"
2021-08-18 13:41:50,"When I read this statement, ""Most states do not compile the numbers by age, sex or the presence of other conditions,"" I was taken aback. The other statement, ""Instead, each state slices its data set differently, in different time frames, and many still don’t record mild breakthrough cases because of a directive from the C.D.C. in May"" also illustrates the great need for a *national standard* on how to compile statistics for public health issues. This just makes the job of public health experts harder and makes research harder. Let's get this going to make sure we have standard information. Also, the underlying protocols for reporting infections and deaths should be standardized. We should be learning as much as we can from this pandemic to improve public health.

Additionally, the CDC needs better communication protocols for the public versus health professionals. I think the biggest misstep was to too quickly recommend not wearing masks for vaccinated folks. They really should've said that they had to wait and see that infections were trending downward for a longer period of time to ensure that mutated variants were kept to a minimum."
2021-08-18 13:42:39,What is the status of a vaccine that specifically targets delta instead of the original virus?
2021-08-18 13:50:15,"The #1 priority should be approval of COVID vaccines for children.  And everyone should get the vaccine.

That is the only way to achieve herd immunity."
2021-08-18 13:50:36,"“Most analyses of breakthrough infections have included figures collected through the end of June.”

Therein lies the challenge. In early June, the Delta variant accounted for just 1.3% of US cases. As of Tuesday, the CDC reports that its percentage is now up to over 98%. 

So to more accurately assess the current breakthrough risks, researchers will need to update their projections with data from the past two months — when Delta was the overwhelmingly predominant strain."
2021-08-18 13:51:33,"Then why are we waiting eight months to give booster shots? Why not six, to maximize the protectiveness?

Also, why the debate about about ""why give boosters when other countries have shortages""? Ramp up production and global distribution of the best vaccines, so that anyone who needs the shots -- including boosters -- gets them. The point is to crush this virus, not to just barely contain it."
2021-08-18 13:51:37,"This article is written so poorly. These type of reports should start by listing objective data: percentage of people who got hospitalized or died, with additional granular information if available. Then I can determine whether or not it is substantial.  Instead, it goes on and on talking about 'very low' rates, minuscule fraction etc. and the actual data is buried deep in the middle of the article. NYT reporters who want to write scientific articles should look at papers in top notch journal and see how abstracts can summarize the pertinent information."
2021-08-18 13:53:33,"A lot of this new breakthrough data is confounded by the fact that the oldest and most vulnerable got vaccinated first, so their vaccines are the oldest, and they remain the oldest and most vulnerable.  

Another thing worth paying attention to is that a good fifth or more of breakthroughs associated with hospitalization or death are asymptomatic, ie the person was hospitalized for or died of something else, but they also got a sarscov2 test and it came back positive.

Finally, I am curious, it is clear that breakthrough cases are vanishingly rare, but if they are an increasing proportion of the total cases, that should also mean that non-vaxx cases are declining."
2021-08-18 13:56:34,"We are vaccinated. But we are back to N95 masks, not cloth ones, and near virtual lockdown. Visiting my sister and her unvaccinated family is totally out of the question."
2021-08-18 13:58:50,De Santis and Abbott should be held accountable for all the Deaths they have contributed to. The spread of Delta is due to the refusal to be vaccinated. St. Louis Cardinal Burke claimed that a micro chip would be included with the Vaccine. Now he is on a Ventilator.
2021-08-18 14:02:11,"So the magical vaccine isn't so magical. They promised if vaccinated you won't catch covid. Now, the vaccinated are getting sick.  Well, just goes to show you. Don't believe everything your government tells you. They've lied to the public before. And, they'll lie again."
2021-08-18 14:03:24,"Vaccines do not provide a force field preventing infection, they give us a leg up in fighting the organism once it gains access. We need to define a breakthrough infection much more effectively, as mild cold symptoms or a positive test and hospitalizations are not the same thing. The Delta variant reproduces at a much higher rate causing more people to be exposed and those people will test positive as the virus is replicating in their nasal mucosa but in the vast majority of cases will not lead to anyone else being infected or experiencing serious illness. This is true with flushots, measles vaccine, and every other vaccine we produce and distribute."
2021-08-18 14:03:55,"Useful article. I got distracted, though, by the photo of two men in a church wearing masks that covered theit mouths but not their noses. One was helping the other register for a vaccine. It seems that some people need a refresher on proper mask placement."
2021-08-18 14:04:24,In one week we know 6 people with breakthrough infections. All are ok button one had a mild case. There was tremendous suffering.  One went to the emergency room unable to breathe with a 104 temp and was told there was no room for him because he wasn't sick enough.
2021-08-18 14:06:54,"Does it only count as a breakthrough infection if you have had both shots with the required waiting times or if you had one shot a day ago and you get Covid is that still considered a break through infection?

I also wish they would report on the breakthrough cases in more detail. Which vaccine? Ages? Underlying conditions? Timeline since vaccinated? Both shots or single shot?"
2021-08-18 14:06:58,"Frankly a dangerous article /headline, easily grabbed by anti-vaxxers and used out of context to suggest vaccinations do not work. Sure, the facts are in the article, but buried way too deep to avoid the damage done by the headline.

Vaccination does not eliminate all cases, but it does massively reduce the risk of death/serious illness.

What about a headline that says ""Breakthrough Cases Prove Vaccinations Protect Against Serious Illness"" or ""Delta in Unvaccinated Shows Much Higher Serious Illness than in Vaccinated"".....

Seriously."
2021-08-18 14:10:11,"The number of breakthrough cases is higher than is being reported because reports are being based on those being tested. The numbers do not take into account those vaccinated individuals who contract the virus and are asymptomatic. Nor are those with mild symptoms but who did not get tested being counted. The article did point out some glaring  problems, including there is no accurate test to determine who has had the virus. That makes it impossible to determine to what degree community transmission is occurring."
2021-08-18 14:10:39,"Someone check my math. 22 million vaccinated people in this data set. Breakthrough infections measured to be 28% on the high side, and that is considered an undercounting. So let’s say 30% of vaccinated people have a so-called breakthrough infection. That means 6.6 million of the 22 million vaccinated have a breakthrough infection. 1.615 vaccinated people were hospitalized in this dataset. Let’s assume they all were hospitalized for covid and not something else and just happened to test positive when admitted to the hospital. So, 1,615 hospitalized out of 6.6 million breakthrough infections means a hospitalization rate of 0.02% for vaccinated people, if infected. And that is being conservative so the rate likely is much lower. And that’s just hospitalizations, not deaths, which the article only loosely describes as much lower. And all of this is measured with looser restrictions on masks, indoor activities, etc. Seems to me the vaccines work great and not much to be worried about. 

It’s called critical thinking. A more honest headline would be along the lines of “Even with breakthrough infections, only a minuscule percentage of people go to the hospital, and even more minuscule percentage die”"
2021-08-18 14:11:16,"I think its odd that we are still using incentives rather than mandates on this kind of thing. 

The unvaxxed need to be in quarantine and locked down.  Stop burdening the rest of us with their inability to care for others."
2021-08-18 14:12:29,"This article falls very short in describing how to interpret the statistic it reports.  It’s nuanced because the vaccinated population skews old and at higher risk for complications and hospitalization from COVID.  And, the article makes a major misstep at the beginning that is only partially fixed at the end. The article reports the percentage of hospitalizations by vaccination status but doesn’t report the vaccination rate of the overall population from which those people come. If the vaccination rate was 100% (wouldn’t that be something), the percentage of hospitalizations by vaccinated people would also be 100%. Neither of those is the case, but you get the idea: as the percentage of the population that is vaccinated rises so too will the percentage of infections/hospitalizations by vaccinated people. That is the null hypothesis against which the percentage hospitalized who are vaccinated should be measured and the article does not explain this well. That null hypothesis doesn’t even deal with the fact that who gets vaccinated also selects for greater susceptibility to hospitalization if infected (older people, those with preexisting conditions). Finally, the behavior and thus exposure to potential infection is also important. If the vaccinated and unvaccinated groups are different in behavior it also changes the exposure rate of the groups and makes the interpretation of the percentage of hospitalizations by vaccination rate even more of a nuanced statistic to interpret."
2021-08-18 14:12:33,"Moderna and Pfizer vaccines are T-cell mediated.  The T cell participates in the immune response.   As you get older you have fewer T cells so you are less responsive to vaccine and more 
vulnerable to infection.   
And individuals differ in their immune response at every age."
2021-08-18 14:16:49,"This makes sense; the higher the number of vaccinated individuals, the higher the number of folks who'll experience breakthrough infections.  The higher number of drivers on the roads, the more car accidents to account for."
2021-08-18 14:17:10,"The documented cases of breakthrough infections are, of course, low when a state like New York does not even maintain detailed data on breakthrough infections.  If so, did New York Mayor de Blasio take that into account when deciding against imposing a simple mask rule indoors?  Does he care that the average number of new cases in NYC reached 2,473 yesterday?  Assuring the vaccinated that the after effect of breakthrough infections are ""mild"" or ""moderate"" is not good enough.  Even though I am fully vaccinated, I am too afraid to use a gym where so many ""vaccinated"" people are huffing and puffing without a mask or use the public transportation to go to office when far too many ""vaccinated"" riders refuse to put a mask on while using the subway.  Given the delta variant virulence, it only takes one infected ""vaccinated"" person to do the damage."
2021-08-18 14:17:21,"Dispatch from Portugal and Northern Spain (not Mallorca), some of the worst Covid- hit countries and those with very strict sanitary rules: almost 90% of the general public wears masks OUTSIDE - you can’t even think about entering a shop or restaurant without a mask. When you enter a popular pub or bar or restaurant, arrows on the floor direct the flow of traffic and the 2-meter distance rule is actually adhered to, even at the cost of standing in line for hours for a seat at an outdoor place. I wonder what Govs De Santis and Abbott think about that. I wonder how much smaller  the number of hospitalizations would be if everyone, the unrepentant unvaccinated and the vaccinated, would continue using masks and businesses ran at limited capacity. But in the U.S. the unvaccinated people’s “freedoms” are more important than saving lives. Selfishness, with an American pin on its lapel."
2021-08-18 14:19:02,"The comment by Dr. Dryden–Peterson￼ makes no sense. “We” haven’t done a bad job of vaccinating all Americans; a lot of Americans have refused the vaccine. Why should their refusal imply anything about responsible people wanting to get a booster shot? So I can’t get a booster until somebody convinces all the conspiracy mongers that the vaccine doesn’t include microchips implanted by Bill Gates or cause sterility?

￼"
2021-08-18 14:21:45,"I was shocked when Dr. Rachelle Wolensky, of the CDC, appeared on national television with a smile excitedly telling the fully vaccinated they could gather indoors unmasked.   This was one day after Dr. Fauci spoke to us about the need for continued caution.   That was a turning point in the behavior of many Americans regarding how to behave in public.   It also seems to be the crack in the door that led us to the present growing crisis with another surge in infections.

Now we need a cohesive message from the experts about how to shut this down.  There is too much equivocation from too many sources.   This has been a public relations disaster that led to a life and death disaster.

If those who won’t accept science want to follow bad direction about personal freedom from unqualified leaders who themselves are vaccinated, like Abbot in Texas, now Covid-19 positive, they need to be marginalized and by federal law required to stay out of public places, including worksites.   Children under 12 and the medically compromised need to be protected and we need clear direction on how to do that, why isn’t this happening?"
2021-08-18 14:24:07,"The CDC is failing at its job of tracking the virus, since it made the decision to NOT keep track of infections in vaccinated people. How on earth is the science on this virus to advance when the CDC refuses to actually collect the data? Not to mention that other countries have made a point of testing for and tracking specific variants, and we are not doing that. As a health-policy agency, they are doing a lousy job, and as a scientific research agency, they are doing a.lousy job. AND their communication office is doing a lousy job. Make it clear, loudly, that anyone with upper respiratory symptoms should be tested, just for the data. Develop titer tests for antibodies. Mandate vaccines. And for God's sake,  get the rest of the world vaccinated!!!!!"
2021-08-18 14:25:00,"Of the people who we saw who were vaccinated that got admitted almost all of them received vaccines 3-4 months ago. We did not see any who was vaccinated 6 months and beyond. If a breakthrough infection occurred that required an admission, almost all of them were older and with conditions that compromised their immune system. I do not think this 8 months later booster dose is supported by clinical evidence. Those who get break through infections get them because the vaccine was ineffective regardless of time duration."
2021-08-18 14:30:13,"Like the anti-vaxxers, I've been doing my own research. The number of people I know personally who have either died of Covid or have the ""long-haul"" variations of the disease, which, though not fatal, appear to be quite possibly permanently life altering, is now in the double digits. I also know a couple of ""breakthrough"" cases which were unpleasant enough but didn't require hospitalization. On the other hand,I don't know anyone who has been made ill by the vaccination. My personal research shows that Covid is the public health threat of our time. At this point, barring individuals with legitimate medical issues, anyone who refuses to get the vaccine is doing the equivalent of playing Russian roulette with their health."
2021-08-18 14:30:53,"Finally a story saying what we all know. 
I personally know four people who have been vaccinated come down with it. 
None were all that sick (very mild symptoms) but they did have it."
2021-08-18 14:36:36,"Our friend became the first fully vaccinated covid death in our county last Thursday. She did everything she was supposed to do, including returning to indoor unmasked activity when the CDC and local health officials said it was ok to do so. Clearly, it was not, and is not, ok. Delta has changed the game."
2021-08-18 14:38:08,"Agree with PNY22 that the article was frustrating.  Graphical visualization and data comparisons are missing.  The article should provide visual data analysis comparing the vaccinated population to the unvaccinated population in each of the referenced states.  Continually in these articles statistics are provided for the vaccinated population (% of vaccinated being infected, hospitalized, death) with no comparable statistic for the unvaccinated population.  The only way to know if the vaccine works is to compare the vaccinated population directly to the unvaccinated population by each analyzed issue (infection, hospitalization, death).  It baffles me why this article, the CDC and others to not consistently provide the data in a clear population comparison format (vaccinated vs unvaccinated).

Please provide a link to the public state data sources so that we can look at and study the available data."
2021-08-18 14:39:06,"Governor Abbott is vaccinated and reportedly symptom-free and yet begins receiving an antibody treatment immediately after his positive test result. I feel that should be part of a BuzzFeed what-the-heck list on politicians communicating, “Do what I say, not what I do.” 
As for President Biden and comments suggesting he federally mandate this and that, those states and those leaders and even many of those persons would fight such mandates with all their might. The president has to navigate between a rock and a hard place which I believe he is doing by not making mandates which very likely would be counterproductive."
2021-08-18 14:43:52,"A bunch of great comments on this article. The best are about the need to compare state by state hospitalization numbers, by vaxxed and unvaxxed to the states' population figures.  But, on the Covid spread front, let's remember that 750,000 mostly unmasked, substantially unvaxxed, party hardy, Sturgis, SurgeUs,  bikers are right now delivering Delta throughout the country. Deaths started spiking this week.  Add that virus ""R"" and doubling rate to your personal estimate of danger, and necessary defensive measures. Get vaxxed. Get boosted. Mask up. This is worse than 2020."
2021-08-18 14:45:10,"This was an extremely confusing article.  I'm vaccinated and certainly not a ""China Virus"" hoaxer, but at this point it's understandable that a certain portion of our population is skeptical.  Between the CDC and inconsistencies in reporting among the states, I'm not even sure what I'm supposed to doing or not doing anymore."
2021-08-18 14:45:12,The rise of hospitalization and death among fully vaccinated peoples due to Delta variants is extremely scary. CDC is confusing us everyday. Two weeks ago they said that vaccinated peoples do not need booster shots and now they changed it. mRNA vaccines are not that effective after 8 months. There should be some policies to revaccinate every 8 months. It seems that we are loosing the war against coronavirus. Of course Anti Vaxxars are responsible big way for this mess.
2021-08-18 14:51:32,"Those who are vaccinated could be more likely to spread the virus because they tend to be asymptomatic or have mild symptoms.   Masks may help to deter this transmission.

Biden and other leaders who appear without masks are now sending the wrong message."
2021-08-18 14:55:40,"I am livid that Bill de Blasio is going ahead Saturday with a concert in Central Park that will apparently be attended by tens of thousands of people. No mask requirement. Also no meaningful vaccination requirement. Show up with one shot, which can apparently be had as late as the day of the concert, and you're in. Proof of vaccination? Forget the Excelsior Pass that taxpayers paid for and that can be downloaded by anyone who's been vaccinated. All you need is a 2""x3"" vaccination card that can be fabricated by anyone with a home printer.

Apparently the U.K. didn't know what it was doing when it required full vaccination and a mask to attend the European football final at Wembley Stadium last month."
2021-08-18 14:55:43,"The information coming from the Biden Administration is confusing and contradictory.  

The best way I have found to understand what is happening and what will likely happen is to look at the trends in the UK and Israel.  

They were weeks ahead of the US and have decent data.  The numbers reported in this paper for both Israel and the UK are disturbing in terms of cases and deaths.    

Be prepared for a difficult autumn and winter here in the USA."

2021-08-18 15:02:13,"The article doesn't mention anything about the rate of breakthrough deaths.  Here is the situation in Illinois:

Every Wednesday, the Illinois Department of Public Health updates the number of fully vaccinated people in Illinois who ""Died Due to COVID-19 or Complications"" (about 2/5 of the way down the page at <a href=""https://dph.illinois.gov/covid19/vaccinedata"" target=""_blank"">https://dph.illinois.gov/covid19/vaccinedata</a>?).  As of 8/11/21, that number is 189.  Four weeks earlier, it was 151. So, 189 - 151 = 38 fully vaccinated people in Illinois have died due to Covid in the four weeks ending on 8/11.  

In the same period, there were a total of, depending on the source, somewhere between 245 and 257 Covid deaths in Illinois.  

Therefore, during the four week period ending 8/11, something in the range of 15% to 16% of Covid deaths were fully vaccinated people.

On average, slightly over half of the entire Illinois population was fully vaccinated during that period.  So, the roughly half of the population that was vaccinated accounted for roughly 15%-16% of the Covid deaths, and the roughly half of the population that was not vaccinated accounted for 84%-85% of the deaths.  This suggests that In Illinois, being vaccinated reduces your chance of dying by something like a factor of five.  That a lot better than nothing, but the risk is not zero."
2021-08-18 15:05:24,"I got COVID a year ago and got two doses of Moderna and believe that the vaccine is overall effective.  However,  I have been very skeptical that vaccine made COVID infections “rare” based on vaccinated coworkers getting COVID.  Hopefully the CDC is giving us the best data rather than the data that they think will change people’s behavior."
2021-08-18 15:08:01,"Ironically the vaccines could be contributing to the problem of spreading mutations.  A paper published in Nature magazine over 20 years ago showed that ""by keeping their hosts alive, such ""imperfect"" or ""leaky"" vaccines could give deadlier pathogens an edge, allowing them to spread when they would normally burn out quickly.""

It seems this is what could be happening with COVID. The vaccine is allowing us to act as incubators for the virus to thrive and morph into more and more treatment resistant mutations."
2021-08-18 14:36:40,I’m tired of pretzeling to figure out ways to convince anti-vaxxers to get a vaccinated. I want my booster shot.

""But in six states, breakthrough infections accounted for 18 to 28 percent of recorded cases in recent weeks.""
Considering that in a fully vaccinated population, 100 percent of cases would be breakthrough cases, and considering that more and more people are getting vaccinated, the percentage of breakthrough cases can only rise.   100 percent breakthrough cases is an ideal goal that we can only accomplish if everyone gets vaccinated."
2021-08-18 13:50:58,"Needless to say that my wife, who called me a computer genius for getting our first Pfizer vaccination appointments back in January and her good friend an absolute idiot for her reluctance to take the vaccine as recently as last week, is now in a state of shock after testing positive the other day even after months of fastidiously following all other CDC recommendations regarding masking and distancing as well.  So far she’s only feeling like she has a cold and hopefully it gets no worse, but it’s just her disappointment that no matter what the situation feel hopeless. I’m trying to be the most reassuring nurse I possibly can but with each day’s downer headlines I have to lie through my teeth to sound positive.  Turning off MSNBC on the bedroom TV is step one.

Above 60: 171.5 non inoculated, 45.2 one shot and 20.7 two.
Under 60: 2.8, 0.5 and 1.2
If the rate is similar everywhere else, to my opinion it is in the interest of the first world to pay for and help to accelerate the inoculation of the 60 and over population of the rest of world."

2021-08-18 15:11:44,"Follow up on my previous comment: Estimating how much being vaccinated reduces your risk of dying depends on what fraction of the population is vaccinated. To get a handle on how much the estimates change, imagine that all the deaths came from a population that was 75-80% vaccinated; this is roughly the rate in ""over 65's"" in Illinois.  Redoing my previous calculations with these vaccination rates suggests that being vaccinated reduces your chance of dying by roughly a factor of 25 compared to not being vaccinated.  1/25 is a lot better than 1/5, but it is still not zero...and not all the deaths in Illinois are ""over 65's."""

I am all about the vaccine but the fact we have to get 3 vaccines in just one year, this is more vaccines then I have had in the past. 3 years (yearly flu shot). I am hoping that we as a group here don't. have to start getting shots every 3 months."
2021-08-18 15:20:02,"Local data (Los Angeles county health department, serving a population of about 10 million) has proved reliable and timely.  A couple weeks before similar data leaked out of the CDC, it was clear that vaccinated people here were catching Covid and there was no reason to suppose they were not also passing it on to others.  This fact was important for local public health policy and it was given appropriate weight right away.

But the national picture is quite unsettling.  At a time when deaths and very serious illness are increasing, reporters can generate thousands of words documenting the argument by countless non-CDC people with excellent credentials in medicine, epidemiology, statistics, ethics, etc., that the CDC is not behaving as if this were an actual emergency.  Given that their mission is “disease control”, the need for this argument should never arise, and it should never reach the point where it is the main story about the CDC.

I see two big problems at work.  First a general tendency for large bureaucracies to concentrate on the mechanics of decision making, to the point where the risks of doing nothing are minimized — so that needed actions are delayed way out of proportion with the actual needs and risks.  As with justice, action delayed is action denied.

Second, the academic mindset seems to be at work, focusing on the preparation of definitive scholarly papers that can survive peer review and be published in prestigious journals.  That’s not disease control!"
2021-08-18 15:24:48,That the CDC and other government agencies are not collecting data on breakthrough cases of all stripes is very disturbing. How could they have survived the past 18 months and not realized how important this data is?  I think the CDC and other agencies charged with protecting us from just this type of pandemic has failed horribly. Both under Trump and now under Biden. The decision making and messaging is just off. Way off. We want competence and the truth. I believe we are getting neither.
2021-08-18 15:26:55,It would be could to know how much having COVID reduces risk of reinfection and death.  And even better to couple that data with having COVID and being vaccinated. Has anyone seen data on that?

Contrary to what CDC told us, it was evident to those of us paying attention that:

1. Masks were necessary from Day 1.
2. Some vaccines are better than others.
3. Going maskless everywhere was a bad idea.
4. Breakthrough infections are not at all rare.
5. Kids can get sick, including inside schools.

Breakthrough can occur and isn't only harmless, so we must impose restrictions. No vaccine, no service. You can't come into the office unvaccinated. You can't be an EMT, cop, fire fighter, soldier, nursing home or hospital worker without being vaccinated. 
The argument that the unvaccinated only harm themselves falls away only when you stop hiding, lying, denying, that breakthrough infections can harm the vaccinated. 
Exactly how much, we don't know, since you would need challenge tests exposing the vaccinated to Delta."
2021-08-18 15:42:33,"It   seems  that the variability in what states are or are not compiling makes it very difficult to get a clear idea of what  is happening in a given county. 

The lack of unified standards across all locations in recording data reflects a decentralization ethic that favors  local control and authority. It  seems to have  shown itself to be an important culprit in  contributing to our  national schism that has created this political + social cauldron of psychopathology and magical thinking within too many people. 

Also, there are  large gaps in the datasets  due to who is taking a test, and when. This  suggests that it's impractical to use conclusions from testing to suggest particular behavior. Not everyone  chooses to be careful, given the delays in test results.

Federal health officials are   flying partially blinded and do not really have a clear and precise understanding who is and who is not likely to get ill given a degree of vaccination. They cannot yet recommend behavior choices that are nuanced and tailored to   individuals' characteristics. 

These holes have contributed to the deep skepticism   that nothing they hear from their typical  disinformation sources about what health authorities are recommending deserves to be followed. 

This has led to the current chaos re schools and mask mandates. Too many adults, esp. governors,  are behaving like children, panicked and stressed out, not knowing   what to do, and not trusting  public health authorities' counsel."
2021-08-18 15:48:53,"So they want me to get another shot of a vaccine that doesn't work? In the meantime the companies haven't done anything to make the vaccines better, the government has failed to engage in emergency production of REAL N95 masks or other protective gear and there is no new plan to mass distribute  boosters, any protective gear or other essentials to the public. 

Then on top of it they are trying to discourage people from getting another shot of J&J, the only one I still will take, even though Israel is reporting data that the other two vaccines are not much better. 

The real topper is that no one has the guts to tell the ani vaxxers and maskers to sit down and shut up which is endangering those of us who vaccinate and mask up. I can understand wanting to speak calmly and patiently to them but we need a Teddy Roosevelt who also knows how to carry a big stick and knock some sense into them.

This has been a complete disaster that  will only get worse and in the meantime China still refuses to answer questions with no repercussions. I would like to see the same international indignation towards China as we have seen over Afghanistan. Let's get our priorities straight.

Biden bet his political governing future on COVID-19 mission accomplished after the 4th of July holiday.  No masking nor social distancing for the vaccinated.

Which turned out to be supremely premature ignorant and stupid.  COVID-19 didn't get nor care about the Biden political message.

So what about the directive in May that told the states not to follow a shared method of recording data?

This whole 'experimental vaccine' business is just that, a giant, mass experiment that isn't even being well documented in terms of outcomes. Not the kind of science likely to persuade anti-vaxxers to take the jab."
2021-08-18 16:00:05,"Now would be a good time for Biden to mandate masks for the entire country instead of allowing the states to set policy on it.  Several governors seem to lack common sense when it comes to protecting their citizens from illnesses.  So too do most companies in this country.  One reason, although it's rarely cited, for the spread of COVID in the workplace is that all too many of us are penalized for taking sick time.  I've seen people fired for taking legitimate sick time.  

The other problem is that some of us, myself included, do not have doctors to see.  I have insurance but it's not good enough to allow me to see any doctor; the doctor has to be on the company's approved provider list and most of them are full. 

If any country has been well equipped to make a medical mess with most care, it's the United States.  We do a better job by our pets than the humans."

With respect to Dr. Dryden-Peterson, ""we"" haven't done an incomplete job of vaccinating in the United States. Aside from kids, the COVID-19 vaccine is available to literally anyone willing to roll up a sleeve at a nearby drug store or healthcare provider. The speed at which the vaccine was developed and distributed in the U.S. is unprecedented and amazing. The people who are unvaccinated are making a conscious choice not to get a shot.

They should never have ridiculed wearing masks, they should have told people from the beginning that vaccines would give limited health while they worked on better versions, there should have been a national campagin to make vaccinating or wearing a mask a  patriotic duty because such propaganda does  work,   they should stop pretending we can suddenly return to normal and they need to have people who don't wiffle waffle.

What is clear is that vaccines are highly effective against hospitalization and death, but will not provide complete protection from disease. That is true of all vaccines. 

Here is my practical understanding:

If you have high risk health conditions and are vaccinated, you have an elevated risk of a moderate or severe case. Immune compromised people are at even greater risk of severe disease or death. 

All people should wear masks indoors during this surge for oneself or the health of vulnerable community members.

Get vaccinated! 
An observation- many vaccine hesitant are untruthful about their reasons. They don’t want to admit they believe misinformation. Beneath those benign objections is a hidden one based on lies from hucksters and trolls. If you read or hear misinformation, push back— flag the tweet or FB post for possible removal. Be a narc."

From the article:

""Most states do not compile the numbers by age, sex or the presence of other conditions. But in Oregon, which does, the median age for a breakthrough-associated death is 83 years.""

OK, ""the median age for a breakthrough-associated death is 83 years"", but what is the typical lifespan in Oregon, say, for a female?  A quick Google search finds this is 82.2 years, which is longer than the male Oregonian lifespan of 77.7 years.  So, people with breakthrough infections are living longer than the average populace?  Why isn't that the headline of the story??"
2021-08-18 16:17:09,"When the vaccines became available, and distributed in the US early this spring, there was and still is no excuse for not getting vaccinated.  Getting the vaccine is free, and available at many pharmacy chains.  At this point, I believe the vaccine ought to be mandated.
 This virus is nothing to pussy foot around with.  It mutates almost hourly, and will soon mutate into a strain that will make the current vaccines moot.   Why? Because there are too many people who have given their cranial neurons a vacation from reason, or statistics an eight year old could understand.  
  This current wave is the plight of the unvaccinated; keeping the virus alive and mutating.  As it sweeps across the country yet again, infecting the vaccine ""freedom"" holdouts, it will kill more and more daily.  I heard recently we just passed 260,000 infections and another 1000 deaths across the US each day; not seen since January.  Your chances of dying from covid are 300 times greater than a vaccinated person.  
Make the public aware the government is not going to pick up the tab if you're unvaccinated and catch Covid; that's out of you pocket.  You go to the hospital ER, at least $1000 to walk in the door.

However, the data need to be analyzed carefully, since it is easy to draw misleading conclusions from observational data if you don't take confounding factors into account.  For example, when the Israeli data are broken down by age, they show that the vaccine is highly effective for all age groups (see <a href=""https://www.covid-datascience.com"" target=""_blank"">https://www.covid-datascience.com</a>/, but be warned that you have to register).  Age is a complicating factor here both because older people are more likely to get vaccinated, and because they are more likely to get seriously sick if they get infected."
2021-08-18 17:09:00,"All Covid vaccines currently available worldwide target the spike protein of the original virus, the one that was first detected in Wuhan. That virus, for all practical purposes, is already irrelevant to the current pandemic. 

All currently circulating strains of the virus have various mutations in their spike protein which make available vaccines less effective. So we are basically vaccinating against the wrong virus.

An often claimed advantage of the mRNA vaccines is that they can be easily modified. So where are the second generation vaccines targeting the spike of the Delta variant? Are the vaccine companies too busy pushing booster shots of dubious utility to bother with developing vaccines that better target the Delta variant?"

2021-08-18 18:37:46,The fallacy about booster shots is that they are just another dose of a vaccine  developed for the original Wuhan strain. That's not what is circulating now. I had the Moderna vaccine and would only consider a booster if it was specifically developed for the current Delta strain.
2021-08-18 18:49:57,"I'd like to know if the people who've had breakthrough infections are people who have low antibodies after they were fully vaccinated.  While most people have not being tested for the spike protein antibody test, many of us have been and it would be helpful to know who is more vulnerable to the Delta variant.  Is everyone susceptible or just those people who have a low antibody count?"
2021-08-18 19:04:11,"It is now very difficult to determine the effectiveness of the vaccine because there isn't a good control population. 

When there were fewer vaccinated, it was easy to compare to similar unvaxed people. Now the vaccinated and unvaccinated populations have very different ages, health, behavior and other factors. 

It is clear that we are going to need much higher vaccination rates to stop community spread. For highly contagious illness like chicken pox or measles that means above 90% of the entire population."
2021-08-18 19:08:58,"I’ve been fully vaccinated since late March and look forward to getting the booster shot when it’s my turn. While I thought the vaccine would keep most of us safe from “dying from COVID”, I’m not as concerned breakthrough infections, I feel protected and appreciate the work of the scientists!  On a different note, if the 93 million unvaccinated Americans would do their part, maybe “breakthrough infections” would become a moot point. Call me hopeful."
2021-08-18 19:47:16,"If the vaccines are as effective as we have been told they are, it makes no sense to me that as vaccination rates go up breakthrough infections also go up. This piece of information is repeated constantly in official statements and in the media in an attempt to convince people that the vaccines work and they should get vaccinated. From the evidence, it seems likely that the current vaccines are helpful but they are not yet as good as they need to be and that they are claimed to be. With the highly infectious Delta variant now widespread in America, and the real possibility that other equally alarming variants will arise, the sensible thing to do is to get vaccinated and then take every precaution we know helps prevent spread, such as wearing an effective mask, social distancing, hand washing, avoiding crowds, etc. A new fact of life: the Covid pandemic will not soon end, if indeed it ever ends, and new pandemics are coming. Take care, be safe."
2021-08-18 20:33:02,"After reading the article on the fourth surge in almost fully vaccinated Israel, the CDC needs to be straight about this issue. Ms. Walensky was going to  look into these numbers last week.  Israel has claimed reductions in efficacy of the vaccine after six months down to the mid thirties percentile, as reported here today.  She may be much too worried about the women in Afghanistan to focus on the American people she is charged with protecting."
2021-08-18 20:34:58,"I'm just wondering why they concentrate mostly on the presence of antibodies when checking for waning immunity, when T-cells are the heavy hitters of the immune system. I understand that checking for T-cells involves much more than just checking for antibodies, but shouldn't they do this as well to get an accurate picture? Penn recently did a small study of a number of people who were Covid recoverees and had received the mRNA vaccines a number of months ago, and it showed that while their antibodies were deemed ""low"", their T-cell activity was high. Meaning that they were well protected. Sometimes I just think this is all just TMI, it is very confusing!"
2021-08-18 21:14:28,"There is essentially no relevant data in this story (or any of the others, which probably means there is none in the CDC report either). What would be relevant? The percent of those vaccinated who are hospitalized or died from Covid. That's the only piece of information relevant to deciding how much of a threat there is to those vaccinated. According to CDC data as of July 12, 0.003% of the vaccinated population had been hospitalized or died from Covid. 3 in 100,000. Of those, 75% were over 65, presumably way over judging by the Oregon data cited in this story and other scattered reports. The vast majority of people under 65 who have been vaccinated are more likely to die from a sharp object than from Covid. In the absence of responsible analysis and responsible reporting, we are doing more damage to the economy, to kids, to local government finances, than we are improving public health."
2021-08-18 21:29:06,"I’m surprised the Biden administration didn’t ramp up construction of testing facilities on January 22nd. Right now in Des Moines, Iowa you have to have a pretty good reason to get a test, rapid or pcr. Maybe they couldn’t imagine the unvaccinated, unmasked and close talkers causing this much trouble but I sure did."
2021-08-18 21:45:50,"Right in the midst of the Afghanistan catastrophe comes a presidential speech (no questions allowed) on Covid

A speech with silly martial metaphors  and calls to “fight” this enemy is pretty tone deaf when we can’t rescue thousands of Americans outside Kabul using actual soldiers.

The UK and Indian data imply delta burns hot and short.  This will be over in a month, based on that data."
2021-08-18 21:02:15,"NYT, please give us an article with data on breakthrough cases.  You did it on August 10.

<a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/08/10/us/covid-breakthrough-infections-vaccines.html"" target=""_blank"">https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/08/10/us/covid-breakthrough-infections-vaccines.html</a>

Please give us current data."
2021-08-18 21:57:48,"Is there any data on whether these breakthrough cases are among people who ceased wearing masks, and possibly other precautionary behaviors ( hand-washing, social distancing, etc.)   It would be helpful to know if it is safe or not to go food shopping with a mask or not, if it would be wiser to return to curbside pick-up."
2021-08-18 22:06:36,"Three things are needed that can easily be extracted from the data if someone has the data:
1. ""Breakthrough"" cases: how long after full vaccination did the infections happen? This would fully solve the matter of how long the vaccine-induced immunity actually lasts.
2. Efficacy: The daily, or at least weekly, absolute and relative numbers of infections in vaccinated individuals: how many infections out of how many vaccinated people. This would answer the actual efficacy question.
3. Protection against severe illness: the absolute and relative numbers of hospitalizations among both kinds: how many hospitalizations out of the number of INFECTIONS, not of total populations, for each case, vaccinated and unvaccinated.
These numbers ought to be prominently posted on the CDC web site, even if they are just regional statistics for states or counties where those data are being recorded.

Also, after  200,000,000 million vaccine doses administered in the US alone over a period of 9 or 10 months, it's obviously true that the safety of the vaccines must already have been established to the Nth. decimal place. Since their efficacy is also well understood, it's unconscionable that the FDA has not yet granted full authorization for their use. With fully authorized meds it would then be legal and legitimate to impose mandatory vaccinations, as it's done for childhood diseases, like polio and mumps, and the problem of hesitancy would be solved ipso facto."
2021-08-18 22:23:09,"‘“Remember when the early vaccine studies came out, it was like nobody gets hospitalized, nobody dies,” said Dr. Robert Wachter’.  This is how a doctor talks???  No one credible ever said *nobody* dies, let alone hospitalized."
2021-08-18 22:27:33,"Variants like Lambda and Epsilon are not far behind Delta. 

For example, one study claim Lambda is approx 2-4 months away.   So potentially there is a gap and plenty of opportunity for breakthroughs for those who waited to get vaccinated before can get their 3 rd shot.  

 On the current schedule, it takes 9 months time to get 3 shots from August and that's a problem too if Lambda does arrive.

 If Epsilon comes along then there will be other gaps.

The point is, with very different vaccine schedules, plus vaccines that lose their efficacy and continuous variants there will always be breakthroughs.  Especially if masks are not mandated in the process.

Look at what is happening in Israel with Delta and breakthroughs.  They are 78% vaccinated above age 12. That info has been available for a while and the messaging here in the US has been limited at best.  

 Hopefully, more people will continuously wear masks layered on top of all the vaccines/boosters for better protection during this Pandemic to try our best to reduce breakthroughs."
2021-08-18 22:44:06,"In articles like this, centered on a story told by data and in data, just show us more complete representations of the full data so we can come to our own conclusions, which may differ from the opinions expressed by the authors."
2021-08-19 00:31:12,"I might have missed this, but it is worth saying (again):
As more people are vaccinated, there will simply be more people having breakthrough infections. If 100% of the population is vaxed, it will be only breakthrough infections that occur. 

Remember the vaccines are strongly protective, but they are not a sterilizing vaccination. Nobody has ever claimed they are."
2021-08-17 11:34:12,"""The World Health Organization has called for a moratorium on booster shots until the end of September, saying available doses should be used to help countries that are far behind in vaccinations. ""

Booster shots are a wise decision. But let's not forget the rest of the world. American values of altruism and self-interest coincide here, since the virus remains a threat to all when it is running rampant anywhere.

The U.S. should do its share to payfor vaccines for countries that can't afford them. What brings happiness to individuals isn't money, but helping others. Same for nations."
2021-08-17 11:35:43,"With so many people already vaccinated in the US, shouldn't we have more than enough samples of people from whom to draw blood and test for antibodies?  I don't mind taking another shot in December (my 2nd shot was in April), but I would rather have more evidence than what feels like a guess, especially from the interested drug makers.  And will the booster still be the same shot or one attuned to the mutations of SARS-CoV-2?  And would such a attuned vaccine need to go through new regulatory approval?

The messaging here is so confusing because one minute scientists are trumpeting that the vaccines' protections will last maybe years, now it's a few months, but maybe it's a few years?  Without more clarity, these kinds of things will continue to undermine confidence.  I know a few people that are going to be a hard NO on boosters, so without some real consensus, it will continue to feel like we're in the world's biggest lab experiment rather than following a coherent treatment regimen."
2021-08-17 11:36:39,"While I appreciate the need to update the vaccine, I would like to understand more about the magic number of 8 months.  In addition, shouldn't the booster do more than renew the same level of protection against the original virus?  Should it not have been designed to be more effective against the delta variant?"
2021-08-17 11:43:40,"My doctor has cautioned me against getting my flu vaccine too early in the fall as the effectiveness diminishes w/i eight months or so of receiving the shot, and he does not want me more vulnerable toward the end of flu season. Given this as an analogy, the COVID-19 booster makes sense to me."
2021-08-17 11:52:15,When I was in school we could find patients who still had low levels of antibody to the 1918 Spanish Flu due to immunological memory. I am not hearing much about studies of immunological memory for Covid and I can’t understand why.
2021-08-17 11:59:30,"While I agree that it sometimes feels like we are in a big lab experiment, let's be adults about this: Scientist, clinicians, and public health officials are learning by the hour, and they are balancing the need for a consistent message against the public's constant demand for full transparency while they evaluate and report in real time. We all need vaccination to eradicate or at least greatly reduce the risk of viral mutation beyond our control; given not only the risk assessment to oneself but also to family, friends, fellow citizens, and world as a whole, we should all work to encourage vaccination and maintenance of our immunity via boosters as more is learned about these viruses. I am willing to accept unknown but relatively small risks associated with vaccination and so-called booster shots over the certain morbidity or even mortality that comes with this disease, which many still do not take seriously enough."
2021-08-17 12:00:47,"As an (unhappy) recipient of the J&J vaccine, I am absolutely irate at the way we’ve been dismissed almost as an afterthought. That vaccine was the only one available at the clinic I was at in April—despite misgivings, I followed Fauci’s advice to just take the first shot available.The next day, they announced it could be dangerous for women of my age group.

Our efficacy rate was low BEFORE Delta entered the picture. Am I completely vulnerable right now? I wouldn’t know, because it seems they only research Moderna and Pfizer. Can I boost my immunity with a moderna or Pfizer 3rd shot—the only reason I ultimately agreed to settle for J&J first? Again I have no idea, because it seems the priority is on figuring out boosters for Moderna and Pfizer recipients. 

The sense of betrayal runs pretty deep right now."
2021-08-17 12:01:36,"Self-interested for-profit drug companies have been calling for boosters for months.  I cannot believe that US officials are going to do this without any good independent research to show that it is necessary.  If you want people to have trust in public health authorities, this is NOT the way to do it.  I am vaccinated and highly skeptical that this is about anything other than profits.  All of the existing evidence that I've seen suggests that boosters are not needed and I don't see anyone presenting evidence to the contrary."
2021-08-17 12:03:40,"I will guiltlessly take my third dose when it's time. 
When I think of it from an aggregate supply perspective, my third dose is the first dose originally allocated to a non-vaxer or anti-vaxer who refused it. 

And if all the non-vaxers and anti-vaxers had taken advantage of their safe, effective, free vaccine, we could have quelled the virus months ago instead of seeing this mutation-based surge that's necessitating third doses in the first place.

That doesn't mean I don't see the urgency in vaccinating the rest of the world, particularly regions with low supply. But it doesn't seem that my third dose comes from their intended inventory."
2021-08-17 12:25:43,I feel like are relying too much on the drug companies to provide the needed data to make these decisions and they are not providing all their data always it seems. Didn't we spend millions to help them develop these vaccines? We are fortunate that other countries with universal health care etc are also studying how immunity wanes over time and safety issues. It's time that we adopt universal health care for everyone and do more to regulate drug profits and prepare for the next mutation or pandemic.
2021-08-17 12:45:27,"Good luck with boosters. I am fully vaccinated, but know I am among many, many people who reluctantly got the vaccine.

We see inconsistent information, a wealth of scientific opinion and a dearth of scientific fact, and a money-making machine for the drug companies. We are also wondering...if parts of the world have had Delta for months, as has Britain, why is it we were so wholly unprepared - again! - for Delta?

I shudder to think what we will discover about this months and years from now.

Moreover, the cold hard truth about those unwilling to vaccinate is...not only are they endangering their own lives, now they are robbing those in need of emergency medical services,  cancer treatment, major surgery, etc; in many parts of the country, the anti-vaxers have taken up all available hospital beds. 

Further, the back log to see many doctors, receive physical therapy, see mental health providers, etc. is often months long. 

If I was not witnessing this with my own two eyes, I would not believe it. But that's the point isn't it? I am witnessing it with my own two eyes, I can see reality pretty clearly, and I am not mired in conspiracy and belief. 

So, am I in the minority? Or the majority?"
2021-08-17 12:46:11,"""Officials said they expect that recipients of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine, which was authorized as a one-dose regimen, will also require an additional dose. But they are waiting for the results of that firm’s two-dose clinical trial, expected later this month.""

The J&J vaccine was given emergency use authorization despite its much lower efficacy, and much shorter clinical trials. Many of those of us who received it are skeptical that it is protective, so we can't confidently get back to more-normal life. And it is depressing.

The *government* should run robust trials of the safety and efficacy of the mRNA vaccine following the J&J vaccine. If there are no safety concerns, then provide emergency use approval for that protocol. I would gladly sign up."
2021-08-17 12:58:45,"Middle managers will decide your healthcare. 
 Right now, the FDA allows shots of either MRNA vaccine as a third shot for the immunocompromised, but CVS policy is to give only matching brand.  There's good evidence that mixing is better for immunity, but CVS decided for me.  And you.  We need the press to focus on the reality on the ground."
2021-08-17 13:00:35,"We prioritized the vaccine for health care workers and teachers. We've since found that members of those groups refused to vaccinate.
It really is time to mandate the vaccination of health care workers and teachers and expand that out to emergency workers. The main criteria should focus on workers having the ability to come into close contact with vulnerable people during their workday occupation."
2021-08-17 13:03:23,"When the vaccine manufacturers are no longer shielded from liability is the day my family will get the boosters.
Until that occurs it ain’t gonna happen."
2021-08-17 13:08:04,"My husband (78) and I (74) were vaccinated last winter, different locations, different vaccines, different appointment schedules, in a process that could only be described as chaotic, confusing, and difficult to manage. My primary concern about boosters is that the distribution will return to the mess of last winter. Please, keep the booster supply adequate and easy to obtain, so I don’t have to drive an hour away. Don’t reinstitute an online registration and appointment process that requires multiple attempts online, after midnight and at 6 am. Let spouses or family members and caregivers get appointments together. I would hate to see this become the competitive game we were required to play in February and March, when we had no choice or even knowledge of the vaccine we’d be receiving ahead of time. I am worried, as a recipient of the J&J vaccine that our boosters may be considered an afterthought, when it may be that they are actually more critical."
2021-08-17 11:56:47,"A second, booster dose? Give me a break. The explosion of Delta variant cases, hospitalizations, and deaths are from NON VACCINATED people. Get them their first and second doses before you recommend we get our third. We are not going to mask, quarantine, or third dose our way out of the pandemic. We keep getting our shots but still have to mask and quarantine? No one will ever get another shot again."
2021-08-17 12:23:05,Just make the vaccine mandatory! If everyone had just gotten it we might be able to help the rest of the world get out of this mess.
2021-08-17 12:33:15,"When vaccines came out, I didn't hesitate to get mine. I've even been vaccinated against Yellow Fever, Japanese Encephalitis, Hep A, Hep B, Shingles, etc. 

But this third shot. I don't know. 

Why do I need this? Where's the science? Why isn't the US running its own studies? Why is it always basing data on other countries? What's wrong with the CDC? Why are they giving us such bad advice?

Is it really Delta that is causing this surge or the fact that the CDC told everyone to open up, take off their masks, and go back to normal? When you have no social distancing, huge crowds at a rock concert in Chicago, people packed together at Disneyland, and restaurants filled to capacity, you're going to get an increase in infection especially when only 50% of the population in the US is vaccinated. We're not even talking here about the world population since globally we're not even close to 50%. I thought herd immunity would be reached when 70% to 80% of the world's population was immune.

I thought Pfizer and Moderna were supposed to be the best (and the Chinese vaccines were so much worse--the media and US politicians gleefully looked at increasing numbers in Chile). 

What about T-cells and B-cells? What about immune memory? Does this mean I need a booster every 8 months for the rest of my life? 

I'm beginning to think that many of the anti-vaxxers have a point."
2021-08-17 12:58:54,"This seems immoral and unethical to me.   Why should we get more shots when so many people in the rest of the world haven’t gotten a single dose?   Personally, I don’t plan to even consider taking a booster unless there is scientific evidence that my original vaccine no longer protects me against death.   I say this as a scientist, and as a vaccine clinic volunteer, but (most importantly) as a human."
2021-08-17 11:37:42,"I see no mention of the hundreds of thousands of Americans that have had ""breakthrough infections""; should they also get a booster 8 months after their vaccine, 8 months after their Covid infection, or on some other timeline?"
2021-08-17 11:40:40,"Out of the blue, the Biden administration announces COVID booster shots eight months after vaccination.

This is nothing more than an attempt to distract attention from the debacle in Afghanistan."
2021-08-17 11:29:28,"Just like with the original shots you are gonna have three types as history has proven. 

1-The first in line group, waiting when the doors to the clinic open.

2-The second will wait awhile to see if their is clear evidence it is working and then decide.

3-Those who will never get the shot.

Society needs all three. Somebody has to start it, somebody has to make sure its right and somebody has to guard against our de facto criminal health care system who will push anything on us to make money. Part of the problem with people not getting the covid shot is this point ie like the boy that cried wolf when something works like the covid shot people don't believe it.

I fall into the middle group."
2021-08-17 11:57:15,"I understand the need for a third shot for those with a weaker inmune system. However, the need of this “for most of Americans” is not clearly demonstrated.

The Israelí data is still questionable, most of the world has not received the first shot, and there is still insufficient studies about the effects of this booster on healthy individuals. 

This booster shot is being pushed, basically by press release which is bad science, by big pharma. 

Are we following the science or are we victims of the greed of a bunch of individuals?"
2021-08-17 12:01:21,"WHAT ABOUT 1st DOSES FOR KIDS??

The nearly 30,000,000 children (approx. 10 percent of U.S. population)  between age 5 through 11 years old, at least 1/3 or 10,000,000 of them aged 10 or 11, are simultaneously at similar risk from CoVID19 as are teenagers and other young adults, AND are still, 18 months into the pandemic, ineligible to receive any vaccination thereof.  And now that are facing returning to 6-hour days indoors in classrooms tight with full, sometimes overly-full, class sizes not allowed, let alone required to keep,  even 3-feet social distance from all the other unvaccinated classmates (including while lunching maskless).  

Can we all please make sure we prioritize getting full initial doses to these 10-12 y.o. children, once approved, before we start
giving boosters to hundreds of millions of adults?

Our future, and theirs, depends on it."
2021-08-17 12:05:23,"I’ll continue to follow the recommendations of scientists and get this booster shot, but where is the national campaign to ensure that more American adults, and adults around the world, get their *first* shot? 

We need better efforts at persuading Americans to get vaccinated and must resolve the glaring vaccine inequity that has left the majority of the world unprotected."
2021-08-17 12:08:05,"We all knew this was coming; it’s the least we can do to help vanquish this pandemic and keep ourselves, our families, and those we care about, safe."
2021-08-17 12:14:39,"I got my 2 shots as soon as they were available.   A little while later some hold outs got a $100 incentive or a chance to win $1 million in a Vaccine Lottery. 

This time I want my money or lottery ticket first!"
2021-08-17 12:17:18,"Seems like low hanging fruit to me.
Sure people will likely need a third shot
But what about kids?
What about the immunocompromised for whom a third shot doesn't work?"
2021-08-17 12:32:01,We're enduring the 2nd year of the Coronavirus pandemic. We will willingly take a 3rd vaccination shot as soon as it's made available to us. The anti-vaxxers and anti-maskers don't care that the Spanish Flu's 2nd year (1920) was worse than the first. They died in droves from that H1N1 virus. No one can change anti-vaxxers' minds about the benefits of the shots. The existential reality is that Covid-19 will kill as many people world-wide (and in the U.S.) as the Spanish Flu did from 1918-20.
2021-08-17 12:49:08,"What's happening in Canada strongly suggests that we need to go back to masks and dramatically pick up the pace on vaccination.

Forget Tennessee, this is urgent here in New York. Bill de Blasio says that 2 million New Yorkers are unvaccinated. On Saturday, he intends to hold a concert in Central Park for tens of thousands of people. Masks are not required. Get a single shot the day of the concert and you're in. Proof? Instead of the NY Excelsior Pass, all one needs is a 2”x3” vaccination card that anyone can fabricate on a home printer.

Both the US and Canada are dealing with Covid Delta, but the number of new cases, per 100,000 people, is dramatically different. Yesterday, the U.S. had 43 new cases per 100,000. Canada had 5. That number was lower in eastern Canada, home to big cities like Toronto and Montréal, where mask wearing indoors continues. Western provinces, playing black sheep, had as many as 12 new cases per 100,000 people as against 4 each in Ontario and Québec. There were only 13 new cases of coronavirus in the whole of Atlantic Canada.

Vaccination is clearly a major factor. Apart from 12 small countries, Canada leads the world on vaccination. It is 13% ahead of the U.S. on full vaccination, and the gap has been growing. The country is rapidly getting ready for the school year. 74% of Canadian teenagers have had at least one shot.

Meanwhile, from the President to the CDC to Bill de Blasio, our own pandemic management plan is flailing about from the top down."
2021-08-17 11:35:02,"We knew this would happen yet the people we’re supposed to trust for recommendations played with us pretending they needed data to delay demand for vaccine that’s spoiling on the shelves reserving shots for the defiant who may never be vaccinated.  

Moderna says six months means significantly reduced antibodies.   Biden tells us no, sorry, it’ll be eight.   My last shot was in February.   If I get sick with my other conditions I’m supposed to take comfort that I might be hospitalized but won’t die. 

This is madness.   There’s no reason to not open to all vulnerable populations immediately.   We aren’t short in supply like we were before."
2021-08-17 11:44:40,"I wish more were explained about the safet/risks and, perhaps, the value of getting a full dose of the vaccine you did not get the first time around.  Especially if you got J&J or Pfizer

Also, what about the children ?"
2021-08-17 12:19:42,"President Trump abandoned his post and the vaccine rollout immediately after his defeat last November culminating on January 6,2021 and still no grand jury for him. The current administration, sorry to say, is more than a day late and a penny short in dealing with the pandemic. Yes, roiling political waters have hampered them but there is no excuse for delay when cases are rising, deaths are rising and schools face the reopening. There is vaccine aplenty and older people need the boosters now not in the late fall. We are told that deaths, severe illness and hospitalizations are rare in the unvaccinated. Today, but what about tomorrow? And breakthrough infections are no small thing. They lead to spread and may produce long covid syndromes. The administration took over on January 20 and said they had a plan. What is it? The country, 7 months later is only 50% vaccinated! In NYC, in 1947, when several people got small pox the entire city was vaccinated in two weeks."
2021-08-17 12:22:25,"Israeli data suggests 16% efficacy against delta for people fully vaccinated in January, as of 7/22. We all the three shots this year,  that includes children under 12.  We have answered the question of is the vaccine safer than COVID.  The only remaining question is how much safer."
2021-08-17 11:27:39,Open it up for EVERYONE at the same time! I don’t want to wait while people in age groups ahead of me turn it down.
2021-08-17 11:34:59,"I am scheduled at my local CVS Pharmacy to get my immunocompromised Pfizer 3rd/booster shot at 1pm today. My last Pfizer shot was January 30,2021, close to 7 months ago.  As an elderly person, 77 years old, the shot I am getting today appears to be about a month before I would have gotten it if I had not qualified for the immunosuppressant group that was authorized for a 3rd/booster shot last Friday.  Hope everyone gets a booster who wants or needs on by year end and that the unvaccinated population who do not have natural immunity gets reduced to a negligible number by year end as well. I suspect we can count on annual booster shots for the foreseeable future, which is fine with me if it works, to hold down sickness and death from this terrible virus that was unleashed on the World by you know who.  Pun intended."
2021-08-17 12:28:36,"How is it possible that mainstream people are already getting a third shot?  I take it they are showing up at Walgreens, claiming to take their first shot and receiving a new vaccine card, which skews the tally of vaccinated Americans.

Can anybody get a third shot now and present their real vaccine card, which would indicate their second shot was less than 8 months ago, or would they be turned away?"
2021-08-17 13:01:36,"Boosters for Boomers? When are experts going to allow children to get even their first vaccine dose? Why did the FDA under both Trump and Biden fail to begin vaccine trials for children under 12 until well into 2021? Such an absolute failure by the US government.

The American Association of Pediatrics (AAP) has been calling on the FDA since fall of last year to begin trials for children. In Oct. 2020, almost a year ago, the AAP said, “It is counter to the ethical principle of distributive justice to allow children to take on great burdens during this pandemic but not have the opportunity to benefit from a vaccine … because they have not been included in vaccine trials."""
2021-08-17 11:40:36,"There is no data supporting an 8 month cutoff. This is a political decision.

2021-08-17 11:47:10,"""the booster program will most likely follow much the same scenario as the initial vaccination program""

That's bad news. The first time around, it was a chaotic scramble to find a vaccination site that wasn't already booked for the next six months."
2021-08-17 13:02:01,"Adapting again to this novel virus. Works for me. I am glad there is the vaccine, prompted by Trump, but effectively distributed to the willing by Biden. Now phase 2, booster shots. Good guidance.

As a supporter of the Pfizer. We had guests who were vaccinated and visited us for about 5 days. One of them had Covid despite his shot. We behaved as normal in close quarters, dining, riding in cars with windows closed, sitting together in various places etc. Good news, none of us suffered an infection from the individual. Good sign to me, the vaccine work(ed)s."
2021-08-17 12:03:04,"I had the virus last March and in March and April of this year I got the two doses of the Phizer vaccine. Much of what I read, including articles in The NY Times, has said that people like me are unlikely to need a booster because having had both the virus and vaccine gives us more protection, with antibodies and T. Cells, than the average person. We were also more likely to have had a reaction to the vaccine itself, which I had after the first dose.

Now I’m reading that everyone will be recommended to get a booster. Why is that when just a few weeks ago other contrary info was reported?  I know that the virus is new and constantly  evolving, but at this point there has been time to do testing for antibodies and memory cells to see how various groups of people might still be protected? Many people will need the booster but not everyone. Stop lumping everyone together. Considering that 90 million million in this country and billions in other parts of the world haven’t had even one vaccine, wouldn’t it be better to get them vaccinated first especially those overseas who are desperate for a vaccine?"
2021-08-17 12:14:23,"“Warp speed” at its best!

Non of these vaccines have been fully approved beyond emergency status, but have been subject to politics and profit.

This should come as no surprise to anyone and we should expect more of the same for years to come as a “bandaid” only lasts for a short time before falling off and requiring replacement.

This certainly provides addition fodder to the vaccine naysayers."
2021-08-17 11:31:04,"I’d be more than willing to hold off on my booster, if it meant we could get more shots to the developing world. It just doesn’t seem equitable that we’re lining up for our third shot while so many people around the world haven’t had one yet. I think it’s time we take our eyes off of ourselves."
2021-08-17 13:10:24,"It is past time for those who have been so-far unwilling to get a vaccine. There’s no lines now, but there will be when the booster crowd becomes eligible. Think of it as your happy hour."
2021-08-17 13:12:32,"So what they are really saying is the vaccine isn't a vaccine. If it was, the effective life cycle would be years, not months.  And will it help against coming variants? I think not."

African nations (among other less economicallly developed nations) are barely starting to vaccinate any significant portion of their populations. They are also significantly lacking in infrastructure to cope with the massive amounts of hospitalizations, yet the vaccines are still flowing to rich countries- primarily the US. How is this allowed? How can an entire nation lack even a drop of empathy? Why does the US think the rest of the world will put up with their greed indefinitely?"

I said even though you have been vaccinated, you can still get a infected, e.g., with a variant,  and you may also be asymptomatic and spread it to others. He answered he and his family hadn't had the vaccine, nor Covid, that they and he were simply immune as evidenced by their lack of infection so far, and he noted he got his blood checked regularly at the VA.... he said the media is making too much of things and scaring people. How is it people still believe these things? We are in for a long hard winter with no end in sight, I think. We need better Healthcare education and better education in general."
2021-08-17 13:08:47,"This is great news.  It's time we get ahead of the curve instead of constantly playing catch-up.   According to NY Times data, we had 252,000 new cases yesterday, taking us to the worst of the Dec-Jan timeframe.    That's with 50-60% of the testing we had at that time - implying cases are likely much higher.   Hospitalizations are well above the level when Joe Biden was elected.   

Joe Biden must demand the FDA provide transparency on the timing of FDA full approval and the approval for 6-12 year olds.    People need to plan their lives and the FDA's sluggish and opaque ethic does us a disservice at this point.  

The good news is that Missouri cases appear to be flattening out.   Hopefully the Southern spike follows suit in the next 2 weeks.   

Biden needs to come back from vacation and show leadership on COVID.   Where are the daily briefings?  When will he take questions?   It just seems odd that the media is sweeping this all under the rug as we enter our most dangerous period since last winter."

Apparently the phone was not good enough for her. Although it would be nice to schedule the booster like a flu shot, let’s make sure the process does not turn into a super spreader event unto itself.  The need to schedule and not just walk-in needs to be communicated.  Hopefully the CDC has hired a PR communications department for this time.  Here to date they have scored a D minus.

The political---vs. scientifically sound----decision to unmask us and reopen us by ""July 4th"" was the first folly.  From that decision to the one of ending the war in Afghanistan by 9/11, the Biden administration appears less enlightened leadership and more of a political soundbite  machine, focused on the next election.

One can only hope that the CDC director takes the honorable way out and acknowledges that the Peter Principle is now the essence of her leadership.  Let Fauci, along with the foremost medical leaders of our country tell us what to do and politics stay out of it."

2021-08-17 13:32:10,"Just like the flu shot we’ll need one regularly, not a big deal.  Unfortunately this will majorly trigger anti vaxxers and discourage others.  I wonder how many vaccinated Americans will refuse a third shot if they were reluctant over the first two."
2021-08-17 13:32:38,I would like to see a booster that is aimed at the Delta variant.
2021-08-17 13:53:37,"Booster advice should be welcomed but it has to be based on science and antibody testing. Wonder how they came up with boosters after 8 months of the 2nd dose of Pfizer or Moderna and not 12 months and why MOST Americans? Most Americans are NOT immunodeficient, unless they have solid evidence that the immunity in most Americans drops after 8 months. Wonder whether the abundance of vaccines far exceeding the demand has anything to do with advise. 

There was evidence reported in the New Eng. Journal of Med. indicating that those who were vaccinated around the beginning of 2021, 8 months ago had a reliable immunity. There are probably reports of persons who recovered from COVID in 2020,who after 8 months have robust broad an superior immunity to not just the COVID spike surface protein but to the most abundant protein inside the virion (Complete virus particle), the nucleocapsid protein. This report has been published in the Journal of Virology Research and Reports last month. So may be that is where the number 8 could have come from.

So what is the science of COVID vaccine to date to advice booster doses? There is still no definitive indicator of protection of the quality of immunity. So we have to rely on the qualitative and quantitative presence of antibodies to get an idea of protection and therefore I would recommend that the booster be advised to only those whose antibody levels fall below a certain level. Another recommendation is to develop 2nd generation of vaccines."
2021-08-17 13:42:28,"Hard pass for me. 
It’s interesting how “recommendations” become “mandates” quickly where covid is concerned. 

Will we skip right to excluding those who refuse the booster from traveling, entering restaurants, and participating in society?  Or will we first try cajoling, like the first time. 

What if this booster underperforms and only lasts for 4 months and in the spring they’re saying you need another shot, lest you again be excluded?  This would’ve seemed crazy not a year ago, which is why you can’t yield an inch to the illiberal notion of vaccine passports and mandates. There is never an end."

The US has half again as many people but did just 0.9 million shots yesterday, while Brazil did 2.2 million. São Paulo held a marathon for young people this weekend with DJs and live music at posts open all night.  They vaxxed nearly half a million people,  about what the entire US was doing in mid-July.  São Paulo now reports 98% of its adults have had at least one dose."

Still, I see this as another failure on the part of the CDC. Only a few short weeks ago, the CDC seemed to be saying “not needed.” Just as they have been throughout the pandemic, the CDC is caught on its heels rather than its toes. The CDC needs a leader who will bring the organization to the forefront and be out ahead rather than continually reacting."
2021-08-17 13:40:12,"There is a desperate need for political leaders to quickly forge a global strategy for vaccination and elimination of Covid-19.


We need to heed the warning signs:

1/. Covid-19 has been evolving in the direction of increased danger to human beings.

2/. The Delta variant of Covid-19 is at least twice as infectious and generates a viral load up to 1000 times higher than the original Wuhan version.

3/. Once infected, vaccinated people generate viral loads of around 30% those of an unvaccinated person providing an ample runway for viral evolution to occur in the vaccinated population.

4/. Vaccinated people transmit Covid-19 with ease.

5/. The SARS-COV-2 virus is perfecting blitzkrieg style tactics in which it rapidly progresses from the initial infection of a host to them being contagious and very ill in as little as 4 days.

6/. There is evidence of  SARS-COV-2 sugar coating itself to deceive the human immune system.

7/. The list of side effects of Covid-19 continues to grow and it is clear that SARS-COV-2 is a highly flexible and sophisticated virus. 

8/. The ability of SAR-COV-2 to move between humans and pets (specifically domestic cats) means it can develop new features in a species living close to humans and easily import the changes into versions of the virus that target human beings.


We can expect SARS-COV-2 to continue to evolve dangerously, evade vaccines and develop more sophisticated techniques to outwit the human immune system."

2021-08-17 14:44:06,"The comparisons to the annual flu vaccine are invalid. Each year, a new strain of flu is identified, and a new vaccine is developed to fight it. This is not a “booster” for last year’s vaccine. It is a new vaccine for a new virus. In the case of COVID, this is the same vaccine being given for the same virus (albeit slightly mutated). Giving more of the same vaccine to fight the same virus, because the first doses didn’t work, is very different than giving an annual flu vaccine, which is a new vaccine developed to fight a new virus.

As a side note: interesting that a group on Twitter a few months ago were delving into the Israel data, and posting that the vaccine appears to be not working, and that 3rd shots were coming. These accounts were routinely banned for “misinformation.” Now, the NYT is saying the same thing in this article. Maybe we should stop banning and censoring contrary opinions."

As with every other vaccine, we have always known there is some risk that comes with Covid inoculation, but we have stark evidence that the risk of morbidity and mortality is mitigated substantially. Pushing boosters now just feeds the public more vinegar at a time when the vaccinated among us finally felt relatively safe, the unvaccinated will tune out even more, the rest of the world could use vaccine from the U.S., and drug-makers' profit motive appears suspicious. We have long suspected boosters would be necessary, but don't all of the above risks outweigh some small gain that might be achieved by rolling it out too soon?"

If you’ve had covid before?  Get the vaccine. If you’re concerned about risk benefit in vaccinating your children?  Get the vaccine. If you’ve had an adverse reaction to the first shot?  Get the vaccine. 
Id feel much more faith in the public health complex if there seemed to be an iota of consideration of trade offs, negative secondary consequences, and the like. As is, I don’t trust any of them at all"
2021-08-17 14:47:38,"To me what the Biden administration is doing is right. If the American public need a third shot, OK then a third shot it is. What I don't understand is why our elected officials (people who represent us in Washington) still say that we don't need to be vaccinated and we shouldn't wear masks. If I were to compare the republicans and Biden. I would have to say that Biden cares about the American people and the republicans don't. It's that simple. If you want to be president, then you need to show the American people that you care about they're health and welfare."
2021-08-17 14:09:30,It would be nice if the booster shot included all know important variants rather than just the original strain.
2021-08-17 14:37:01,"Please, Please, Please can we not get into the craziness of ""your booster needs to be the same vaccine as the original"". This makes no scientific sense at all - the vaccines all deliver instructions for your own cells to make the spike protein (either mRNA or DNA depending on the vaccine). The actual ""immunization event"" is your own immune system responding to the foreign protein. It just does not matter whether the original nucleic acid came from Moderna, Bion-Tech, J & J or whoever. If anything, there are reasons to think that the immune response will be if anything better from heterogeneous immunizations and the adverse effects will be less.
(and just FYI, I AM a scientist, it's the physicians' judgements  I worry about)"
2021-08-17 14:48:16,"What about making sure we
Have enough vaccine and, important, enough appointments, for out as-yet unvaccinated children?"
2021-08-17 14:14:52,"Treatments? Any new, viable treatments for what seems to be unavoidable?"
2021-08-17 15:10:28,"Interesting to read so many negative comments from readers about another flu shot. In my opinion we should be thankful  that these vaccines are available to save lives. Our annual flu shots are the result of the Spanish Flu of 1918. No doubt, an annual booster shot will be required from the Pandemic of 2020. Don’t want it? Don’t take it and put your life at risk as well as your loved ones and others. Time to grow up America and get real!"
2021-08-17 14:29:05,"Why do you write, ""For weeks, Biden administration officials have been analyzing the rise in Covid-19 cases, trying to figure out if the Delta variant is better able to evade the vaccines or if the vaccines have waned in strength over time.""

In fact, this analysis is being done by career civil service scientists, not by Pres. Biden or his appointees.  ""Government scientists"" would be a far better descriptor of whose doing this. Referring to the ""Biden administration"" implies it is somehow political, which it is not.

(Aside from that, I'll be scrambling for my third shot when I am eligible)."
2021-08-17 15:02:59,"It's likely that booster shots and annual vaccination will be necessary to manage the coronavirus. This will only be possible if vaccines continue to be available in the US and around the world.

American vaccine production is dependent on major pharmaceutical companies, which develop, test, manufacture, and distribute vaccines and drugs against Covid. Today, lawsuits threaten the viability of these firms.  J&J manufactures one of 3 FDA approved vaccines. The company lost a 2$B lawsuit alleging baby powder caused ovarian cancer, and is part of a $26B settlement over claims it helped caused the opioid crisis. Literally tens of thousands of additional suits are pending.  

I personally don't think these suits have much merit, but this doesn't matter. The simple truth is that if drug companies go bankrupt, we won't the the vaccines we need.

During the 1970's and 1980's vaccines nearly became unavailable in the US, only a last minute no-fault liability law passed by Congress in 1986 enabled US vaccine product to continue.

Today, there is no vaccine available in the US for Lyme Disease.  There used to be, but in 2002 it was taken off the market, largely due to class action lawsuit.

Civil lawsuits are an important part of our legal framework, necessary as a counterpoint to irresponsible behavior by some companies and individuals. But the system we have today is unfair and out of control, and needs to be reformed by Congress.

We need vaccines more than we need more lawsuits."
2021-08-17 15:00:25,"It’s frustrating that the US is always behind the curve from other advanced countries in managing this pandemic. There was data from Israel months ago that the Pfizer vaccine’s protection waned considerably for those over 60. I think the CDC keeps adjusting their messsge (eg., masks suddenly no longer needed for the vaccinated while the WHO was saying the opposite) in order to avoid anything that would further discourage the vaccine resistant from getting their shots. That’s why they’ve waited until this late to embrace the inevitability of booster shots. They keep having to eat their words unnecessarily. Anyone with a functioning brain who keeps track of what’s happening in the rest of the world knew back in June that it was only time before the Delta variant took over the US."
2021-08-17 14:52:59,"ok, no problem. Happy to get the booster just like the annual flu shot. Now will someone get the FDA in gear to provide non-emergency orders for the Covid Vaccine so we can start requiring people to get the vaccine in an enforceable way."
2021-08-17 15:03:11,"the heart-transplant community has already taken their own health into their own hands, getting booster shots of a different kind than that they originally received (ie. the Johnson & Johnson 6 months after the 2nd Pfizer). 

Is there any research yet regarding Moderna's long-term effectiveness compared to Pfizer?"
2021-08-17 14:51:50,"I really wish they'd let kids get the vaccine...
These unvaxxed folks are allowing more mutations to occur and risking our precious little ones. And governors aren't stepping up with mask mandates, just back to school as usual. I'm glad front line health care workers can get a booster, but let's not forget our children. Long Covid at 60 vs 6 is a much shorter lifetime."
2021-08-17 14:59:35,"If 90% Americans are not vaccinated, COVID will continue and new variants will appear which can be more dangerous than Delta. Then we will need 4th booster shot. When it will end. The scientists should be more aggressive to find real solutions and Biden Administration has to come with better policies. The vaccinated peoples are desperately looking for booster shots. It should be readily available to all who want it."
2021-08-17 15:03:19,I’m ready for the booster. Just give me the green light and I’m there. As for the anti vaccination crowd lock them out of work school restaurants bars retail stores etc. And when the FDA approval is official make the shots mandatory. We are not going to let weak minded people cause the human race to go extinct. Not happening.
2021-08-17 14:35:05,"My neighbors walk into Walgreens with their vaccine card and Medicare card, sign a waiver and are administered a third shot independent of their health or immune status. It’s as if the chain pharmacists make their own set of rules with the only cardinal rule in this dysfunctional state being, “ just don’t get caught.”
As a practicing physician I am receiving calls, emails, texts from patients inquiring why shouldn’t they take a third shot when all their friends over 50 and neighbors are getting it.? Once again the CDC puts out guidelines in the midst of a public health crisis and everyone just does what they want to independent of data and regulations"
2021-08-17 14:30:58,"Please clarify: Is the ""booster"" shot referred to in the article a new version of the vaccine that provides better protection against delta and other variants? Or is it a third does of the same Moderna or Pfizer vaccines? The language in the article does not make this clear and it is critical."
2021-08-17 15:31:50,"About time. And also, it's well past the time that these vaccines should have been given full FDA approval."
2021-08-17 14:27:23,No more coddling the unvaccinated. No vaccine. No entry. Period. Spent a year begging these people to grow a brain to no avail. Time for the smart people to run the show.

2021-08-17 15:17:43,"This feels premature.  The Israeli data is here (slides are in Hebrew but the figures in English). For those vaccinated in January, the effectiveness against infection is no different from zero. But importantly, the effectiveness is to be 82% against hospitalization and 86% against severe Covid (i.e. requiring ventilation). So yes, you can easily get Covid even though you're vaccinated because of the Delta variant, but it's not going to be anything worse than a bad cold for the vast majority of people. It would make more sense to focus on getting everybody vaccinated, and if it takes some sort of mandate, so be it.

2021-08-17 15:17:25,"WHAT ABOUT OUR CHILDREN under age 12?

Can we please get them all fully vaccinated before we start draining supplies giving boosters to others?  You know, like the manners your own mother taught you: let everyone have firsts before you go for seconds.

Especially as and because the government requires parents to send our vulnerable little ones back to schools with no mandated social distancing, no special precautions as 22-200 kids sits down, unmasked and cheek to jowl to eat lunch together.  If, that is, if they are even required to wear masks at all (thinking of you, death-
wooing DeSantis and ask-me-if-I-care Abbott, among others)."
2021-08-17 15:41:27,"Our under 12 yo kids start school this week.  There will unfortunately be little social distancing, as none is currently required despite the fact that data relied on to show schools were safe during 2020-2021 school year did, is based on schools that for the most part enforced 3-6’ radius social distancing.  

We are luckier than families elsewhere in that our county requires masks worn by all and, just the other day, vaccines for all eligible adults (but not yet eligible students).

What I want to know, in addition to safety reports about and, one hopes, schedule for the under-12 vaccine roll out, is whether public school personnel and volunteers will be required to prove they’ve timely received their booster doses as well?  Teachers were among the first Americans to be eligible for Covid19 vaccination, meaning some of them will have waning immunity right as the the school year begins and into the start of cold & flu season.

In addition to making sure our younger kiddos have ample opportunity to receive full vaccination (assuming it’s deemed safe), we and our leaders should be making sure our school employees remain safe as well.  For them and for our children and for our communities."

A direct quote: 

“I watch [Israeli data] very, very closely because it is some of the absolutely best data coming out anywhere in the world,” says David O’Connor, a viral sequencing expert at the University of Wisconsin, Madison. “Israel is the model,” agrees Eric Topol, a physician-scientist at Scripps Research. “It’s pure mRNA [messenger RNA] vaccines. It’s out there early. It’s got a very high level population [uptake]. It’s a working experimental lab for us to learn from.”

Seems like it would be better to surprise your immune system with a different brand of booster.

Or better yet, seems like it would be even better if the vaccines were reformulated to include all the strains.  Somehow I’ve not read anything about reformulating the vaccine."
2021-08-17 15:33:19,"People seem compelled to collapse every continuous variable into a binary in their mind.  Any value between 1% and 99% must therefore be rounded to either 0% or 100%.  It saves brain storage space, I guess.

Comment sections like this just seem like endless repetitions of this same phenomenon, in brain after brain.  No one seems able to cope with the idea that something can be helpful and can quantitatively improve outcomes, yet lie somewhere *between* perfect protection and useless."
2021-08-17 15:20:20,"Many commenting here are frustrated about the possibility of a booster shot.   It sounds as if they are saying ""I'm tired of this virus stuff and just want it to be over!"".   The virus isn't tired.   The virus doesn't respond to tantrums.  The virus doesn't care about our opinions or ignorance.  In fact, the virus is working overtime to thrive.   Most of us will do what we have to do stay healthy.  Some of us will continue to ignore or distort what is happening to fit some political or personal scheme.  These persons are the low hanging fruit.  Yet, all of us are in this battle, which could go on for a long time.  Settle in; do the best you can; there will be setbacks along the way."
2021-08-17 15:26:13,"Sadly, most people cannot see the numbers which dictate this need. Until eighty percent of Americans are vaccinated, the pandemic is not over in this country and we will be continually trying to manage it. Worse, it will persist globally and return with new variants until eighty percent of all seven billion people are vaccinated. So even after we have achieved herd immunity, it can still come back."
2021-08-17 15:26:03,"I'm not surprised we need boosters, nor do I blame the scientific community for not knowing everything about a new species within a year of its appearing on the planet. 

Delta proves that this virus mutates quickly, and that new variants may be even more resistant to vaccines. 

We MUST be as adaptive as the virus is. If that means boosters or even different sets of vaccines, that's what it means. If it means coming and going mask mandates, that's what it means. If it means on-again, off-again shut downs, that's what it means. 

NO ONE WANTS THIS. But it's here, and it is not just going to ""go away."" The return to pre-pandemic ""normal"" may never happen. COVID is reality. It is the new normal. If we don't adapt to that fact, we're doomed."
2021-08-17 15:25:07,"While I have been a strong proponent of vaccinations, I am perplexed and not necessarily convinced that I￼ should be getting a booster until our little children are protected. Vaccinating children under the age of 12 should be the highest priority, particularly since unvaccinated people are infecting our precious children.  Why are we not hearing more about the progress or lack thereof toward vaccinating our vulnerable children!"
2021-08-17 15:44:31,"This is not an annual booster. We're talking about 8 months, a big difference. And American governments and employers have already imposed draconian measures to strongarm citizens into taking a vaccine that is not even fully FDA approved. Now we're doing it again. Then what? Will the government mandate the booster? And what about the next variant? Because there will be another. I envision a lot of pushback here. Even many vaccinated readers are unhappy with the idea of taking a booster whose efficacy is unclear at best."
2021-08-17 11:35:30,"Like a million other Americans, I got my third shot last week and recommend that anyone who is 5-6 months away from their initial vaccination do so as long as supplies remain plentiful.

But what we really need is universal vaccination. I'm thinking that it may be time for a formal boycott of companies that don't require vaccination for their staff and patrons, the latter at some times, anyway. Why can't Amtrak have vaccine only cars? Why can't the airlines have vaccine only flights? Restaurants, theaters, and bars vaccine only days?

About the only thing that gets things moving in this country is the bottom line."

2021-08-17 15:52:58,"Makes sense, as Albert Bourla did say the protection is gradually eroding. Not bad at all right now, with vaccinated hospitalization 6.5 times lower and deaths 5.4 times lower than unvaccinated, but not the 95% margin we had in the Pfizer trial. The booster goes out in the same order as before, nursing homes first, then older people in the community, and then the rest.

I hope we get with the program on this virus; we really need our eligible unvaccinated getting their shots, and boosters when indicated. The companies may update the vaccine formula itself pretty soon, as is under study. It’s no fun being sick, no fun worrying about catching it or the complications; yet we have vaccines which greatly reduce these hazards."

Of course there was going to be booster shots.  This virus is a continual changing entity that gets stronger and more destructive as it mutates.

The flu shot is only good for one year.  I don't squawk about that shot, I'm certainly not going to squawk about a COVID booster shot.  My husband and I will do what it takes to keep each other safe.  That's our bottom line.  We do it out of mutual love for one another.  There isn't a better nor more compelling reason than that for us."

Getting up in the middle of the night in hopes of finding an appointment. Going through the laborious process of registering only to have the site crash. It was traumatizing.   How will I bear doing it again?
2021-08-17 16:24:45,"It is time to boycott any business that does not affirm they have their employees vaccinated. At this point, with vaccination having been proven safe and effective, any hospital or nursing home that does not require all employees to be vaccinated is violating the expected standard of care for patients and is guilty of malpractice. Meaning any death due to nosocomial infection with covid is a wrongful death and any  person who contracts covid in a hospital or nursing home with unvaccinated staff has a cause of action."
2021-08-17 16:33:37,I've been looking at the Times vaccinations and hot spots maps. The expected low vaccination rate equals hot spot and vice versa correlation is not clear cut. Often not the case at all. From a quick review it looks like Presidio county TX might have the highest percentage of vaccinated over 12 residents in the country at 91%. Miami-Dade can match any deep blue county for vaccinations yet has a moderate high infection count. More factors at play in this.
2021-08-17 16:34:09,I bet There are less than 5 people who are healthy under 50 who have been fully vaccinated who have even been hospitalized on supplemental o2 and here we are recommending boosters ? No thank you.
2021-08-17 16:27:26,FDA Covid vaccination approval is expected any day now. When that happens vaccination must become mandatory. Also all minor children approved by the FDA for the vaccines fall under the responsibility of their parents to see that they are vaccinated. If you fail to vaccinate your FDA approved child and they fall ill you will be held responsible under child welfare laws. We must ensure that all vulnerable people are vaccinated and that includes our children. We are not going to stand by and passively watch a generation of young people fall ill.
2021-08-17 16:17:37,"Can’t we just call the Delta variant Covid-21? I think that would also help people get into the mindset that this is going to be like the flu from now on… we will forever need annual Covid shots alongside our flu shots.

2021-08-17 16:02:12,"I know a doctor who chose one each of Pfizer and Moderna last year, and I've heard others say it might be good to switch up the booster. Will that be possible? Is there an opinion on doing it?"
2021-08-17 16:09:51,"I gladly and proudly took my Pfizer shots but if we are to mandate booster shots every 6-8 months we need to discuss side effects and natural immunity as well. 

We know the second shots are about 5-10x more likely than the flu shot to cause fever, chills, and general malaise. Also we've seen they very rarely cause myocarditis in young men.  Furthermore based on reinfection data it looks like natural immunity is longer lived than 6-8 months. 

What is the safety data on the booster shots? It could be that if you're a young male who has had covid and is already 2x-vaxxed the risk of taking a booster outweighs the benefits. Perhaps that's not the case and I am sure the CDC will do more research. However the bar for the government mandating anything that has even a small potential to be harmful should be very high. I don't think we're there yet and I am frankly quite surprised by how authoritarian the top comments are on here."
2021-08-17 16:14:00,"Another development leaving more questions than answers.  Just a week or two ago a big ballyhoo was made over approval of third shots for the immune compromised.  It was unclear why so much was being made of an issue affecting about 3% of the population.  Dr. Fauci explained at length how immune compromised individuals never really developed a strong immunity.  He added that booster shots may be indicated for the general population some time down the road, but not at this time.  So why the sudden change?"

2021-08-17 16:13:03,"I recommend relaxing a little. For one thing, we know that these vaccines do an amazing job of protecting against serious illness many months after full vaccination. So if you get your shots…

And the deal is, studies that say immunity appears to wane around eight months after full vaccination are NOT telling you that your vaccines shut off next Monday at 4: 43 PM EST. They’re telling you that the level of protection is likely to start coming down significantly around eight months after vaccination. 

There’s some time, okay? Breathe. And there’ll be enough to go round, and kids under 12 aren’t going to get the same shots. 

And if you’re not vaccinated at all, wouldja please get yer darn shots?"
2021-08-17 16:41:02,"I am a teacher in a private school who was vaccinated in February and want a booster. I am seeing my doctor today to discuss it.

We eat in our classrooms but I plan to eat outside and will encourage parents to send lunches that are something you can stand and eat if it rains until their children are vaccinated. Our school policy is silence at lunch time but that was difficult to enforce last year so I assume it could be the same again. I wish things would happen faster here."
2021-08-17 16:41:19,"As an RN, I'd like to see the evidence based data to support this.  I'm not against a booster, but I don't want a political entity telling us to get a booster.  This recommendation needs to be coming from infectious disease physicians who have been studying the data.  Further, since the original mRNA vaxes were for the initial covid virus, shouldn't we be getting boosters developed for the Delta variant?  Just wondering and asking."
2021-08-17 16:44:07,"It's startling to hear so many privileged and resentful comments. Human beings, unvaccinated not by choice but because no vaccines are available in their country, are dying by the thousands. I'm eternally grateful and humbled that we live in a country of plenty. A grievance about getting a booster or two or three or even more at best rings of petulance and at worst, unremitting entitlement. 

It was always clear that a booster would likely be needed and science is working as fast as it can to keep up with mother nature, a formidable foe. 

Once can choose to have grace and gratitude or kvetch. I choose the former."
2021-08-17 15:48:42,"The original covid vaccines are too narrowly targeted (on just one part of one spike of one strain of the virus).  Thats why theyre not providing effective protection.  The vaccinated get infected, harbor germs, and pass their vaccine-resistent germs around.  

Youve heard how antibiotic resistent germs are created.  The same us happening here.   These vaccines  are driving the covid virus to mutate into more infectious versions.  We need more robust vaccines. Perhaps one based on an older approach where weakened virus is used.  Or some combo of old and new techniques.  A booster of the same so-so vaccine given every few months can’t possibly be the best we can do in 2021."
2021-08-17 16:44:02,I find it weird that boosters are coming out now. What is the actual evidence that people under 60 need a booster if they’re not immunocompromised? There’s other countries that barely have any vaccines. If we want to severely hinder this virus world-wide than we need to send our extra supply to them. Also we have children and lots of unvaccinated people in the US that need to be vaccinated.
2021-08-17 16:49:40,"We're getting this all wrong. Kids should be vaccinated before adults get boosters. Assuming the vaccines are identical, and it sounds like they are, young kids should get one shot before we get three. Since full FDA approval will be a long time in coming, we should accelerate emergency approval for children. That way we have more people vaccinated. The evidence demonstrating average adults need to be vaccinated again seems flimsy. But it's proven kids spread COVID quickly."
2021-08-17 16:46:23,"I’m happy to get a booster that is needed.  However, my experience with the J&J shot was miserable.  2 days in bed, fever, vomiting, and a reoccurrence of symptoms 2 weeks later when the injection site blew up again.  I had vertigo and some weird symptoms I had never had, like profusely bleeding gums that made it hard for me to get my teeth cleaned during that time period.  I am a person who typically feels crappy after a flu shot, and Everything ultimately  resolved, but I was so relieved to have it just be a “one and done.”  My sister had the same vaccine and she was in worse shape than I was…missing 3 days of work, and my husband reacted pretty strongly too.    I was really, really hoping we would be able to get a Pfizer or Moderna booster, as my family/ friends who went that route had much milder side effects.  I’m still hoping that is an option."
2021-08-17 16:27:16,"Let's not beat around the bush.
We have to get a third shot because the Maga folks refuse to be vaccinated.

Let that marinate for a moment."
2021-08-17 17:34:56,"I'm curious: are the pharmaceuticals developing any vaccine or booster targeted at variants like Delta and Lambda? I've read the latter, although not currently widespread in the US, can evade current vaccines (?).  And as far as vaccines go, is it the thinking in the medical/scientific community that, as long as the virus transmits and mutates, we might be in for periodic boosters, like the flu shot?"
2021-08-17 16:57:16,"Interesting to watch so many Americans ready to compel their fellow citizens to submit to a medical intervention that has not even been formally approved. That kind of mob psychology is an ugly thing. Pretty sad. Especially, when disease outcomes stratify by orders of magnitude across age. (CDC, WorldinData, etc)

It is clear we will not vaccinate our way out of this. The virus is too canny for that. And, the borders are too open to keep new variants out. Vaccination, better vaccines and effective ""early"" anti-viral treatments are the combo that is needed. And, of course masks in public indoor settings.

Get the vaccination and keep it up to date with boosters and wear a good mask to protect yourself and your family. Socialize with those on the same page as your family. But, quit trying to force others to do something so you can feel safe. It will not work. 

And, look at the demographics of vaccine resistance. African Americans and Hispanics are the lowest percentage of vaccination. Asians are the highest. Do you really want to start using the force of law along those lines? And, it is not about equity and accessibility of vaccines."
2021-08-17 17:41:27,"Two doses of Pfizer or Moderna COVID-19 vaccines remain efficacious against the original variant and Delta variant. The third vaccine shot gives us more efficacy against the original variant and more durable against the Delta variant. It turbocharges the standard doses. Natural immunity from COVID-19 disease is much less durable. Further, It has nothing to do with vaccine hesitant and resistant folks. Let’s get all vaccinated folks."
2021-08-17 17:55:29,what about booster shots for California??? in florida people are alredy getting boosters at CVS   but here in CA.  THERE  is nothing available yet. how come?I'm leaving for europe September and would feel safer having a booster against the variant.
2021-08-17 17:15:04,"Agree with Pitchforks. If more people would have vaxxed initially, less likely Delta would have even appeared. Sara, your general health was probably not optimal to begin with. Everyone should work toward improving their health. Eat right, maintain acceptable body mass, don't smoke, get rid of meds, etc. It is statistically proven that Americans eat poorly, are generally obese, and take meds that their doctors and the pharma industries pump to the market. Admittedly, there are some people who have chronic illnesses through no fault of their own. Yet most people just don't take care of themselves and are dependent on chemicals, even aspirin is bad for you if taken in excess."
2021-08-17 17:17:30,"Almost 40 year old guy here, had my third shot (Pfizer) yesterday. Pushed for it because I'm on postsurgical steroids that are suppressing my immune system, and because I had a feeling the booster was going to be inevitable anyway. (Can't say I expected the announcement to drop literally the next day.) My second shot was just over six months ago and I had to come home from the surgery on a lot of connecting flights through red state airports, so I figured now was the time to be primed to fight delta.

Anyway, I'm only one data point, but from my experience I don't think I needed the booster yet. My immune response was ... robust, to say the least. I had no side effects other than a sore arm after dose one and fatigue for 8-12 hours after dose two, but this one knocked me for a loop. I was out of commission all day with what felt like a gnarly head cold: runny nose, chills, stuffy head, lack of appetite, the works. 

All those symptoms kicked in within maybe 45 minutes of the booster, so hey, the original vaccines worked, my body was ready to fight. Thank you, science! I don't regret getting the booster, but I should've had a little more faith in the original vaccine and I could've waited a while to boost. As the doctors keep reminding us, for youngish people in reasonably good health, it works!"
2021-08-17 17:44:46,"Like it or not, masks need to be required everywhere - vaccinated or not - until this virus is eradicated.  If you don't want to wear a mask forever, get your shot.  Until then, masks do not come off until all fifty states - down to the tiniest county - has MINIMAL infections.  I'm tired of people treating this as a ""rights"" or ""freedom"" issue.  It's a PUBLIC HEALTH issue!"
2021-08-17 16:56:41,"This booster shot is a strange idea, (I'm for vaccination and had my two shots). The facts are simple; even fully vaccinated can catch it again and can infect others, however they will have an easier disease and their infectivity period will be shorter. 
Another well-known fact is that antibodies decline fast, within 3 months you will have about 8% of your peak.
The big question is: Did the vaccine create long-term immunity or a temporary shield.
This booster shot seems to suggest that the CDC considers vaccination as a 'temporary shield' which will require a booster every 6 months.
Since the vaccine shots have very minimal detrimental effects, it makes sense to normal people to take them, but I wish that authorities will be level with us and explain the issues."
2021-08-17 16:59:14,"I've been reading a few commenters who have many concerns about the advice on boosters.
This is a good time for all of us to remember that this disease is new, and we will be getting new information about it frequently.
I know it's difficult.  Lets all try to learn this new ""Covid Dance"" and get on with it.
Remember, the common cold has been with us as long as we can remember and there is still no cure for it.
We got very lucky with the vaccines this quickly in the game."
2021-08-17 17:50:59,"Wasn't the benefit of using these MRNA vaccines is how quickly and efficiently they can be tailored to a specific virus? Will these booster shots be tailored to Delta and if not then what sense would it make to get it? I'm all for getting my third shot, however how soon after the third will there be cause for concern for a 4th?"
2021-08-17 17:51:21,"All of you saying you care about variants: this booster thing only 8 months in is downright immoral (with the exception of medical workers and the extremely vulnerable/elderly).  

The variants have the best chance of evolving among the billions of unvaccinated in the third world who haven't even had the chance of one shot.  If you actually care about ending the pandemic and lessening the likelihood of new dangerous variants push for widespread distribution to the third world, along with expropriation of Pfizer et al.'s intellectual property rights/patents to help this to happen.  

This is just because Pfizer etc. want even more obscene profits and can't get them from distributing to third world countries.

Following regular reliable news outlets such as these pages I keep hearing about ""long lasting immunity"" for the fully vaccinated and previously infected, or ""at least two years,"" (it's always changing) plus that the vaccine is still extremely effective against all known variants including Delta.

I'm fully vaccinated but pushing the boosters when so many haven't even had the opportunity to get one shot is immoral.  That we are trading the chance to end or severely curtail the pandemic in favour of upholding the right to obscene capitalist profits is the biggest tragedy of this whole pandemic."

2021-08-17 17:14:28,"I will gladly get a third dose when I can. I want to be part of the solution, not part of the problem.  I am staying away from people that I know for a fact have not been vaccinated. They have a death wish, I do not."
2021-08-17 18:10:19,"I trust the makers of these miracle mRNA vaccines, largely because they've been proven to work, and because their development was driven by profits - a sure indicator of success.  I do not trust the CDC, the WHO, the news media, or the government, especially Republicans, because these organizations are filled with bureaucrats and self-interested pols.  

Another related thought: Imagine how much safer and more secure we all would be if the Reds were to get the shots just like the rest of us, instead of fearing them as they do today.  If you're not a part of the vaccine solution, then  you are not only part of the problem, you're killing yourselves and your friends and families.  Think about that, if you can think at all..."

I brought a note from my oncologist verifying my status (in case they needed it), but when I asked the pharmacy folks if they were in fact verifying the ‘immunocompromised’ status of those who make appointments for third doses, they said no.  So it seems that anyone could make an appointment and get a third dose right now, as they’re simply taking you at your word that you currently qualify for the third dose.  BTW the third dose is simply another round of the second dose, and if you got the J&J vaccine, you’re out of luck for now.  Strictly Moderna and Pfizer at the moment."

My son is an active duty Army officer who received the J&J vaccine (easier to ship, only one doze) while deployed in Baghdad.  With all one reads about the efficacy of the J&J product, it seems that supplementing it with two shots of the Moderna vaccine would be the best way to go.

Does this make sense? - is it something that may be possible down the line?"

2021-08-17 18:56:47,"US public health officials are in a delicate balance, trying to gently reveal and respond to the news that vaccine effectiveness has dropped since delta took over, without over-publicizing it to the point that people start to give up on the vaccine.  Boosters will help to claw back some of those losses in effectiveness.

Note that with Pfizer, the effectiveness in Minnesota against both infection and hospitalization plummeted in July (when the prevalence of delta rose) to only 42% effective against infection, and a disappointing 75% against hospitalization.  Decent, but not great.

The counter-balancing risk of over-selling the vaccine's protection is that people may feel invulnerable and degrade their behavior.  At 75% effectiveness, if someone thinks the worst that can happen to them is the flu (no longer true with delta) and then as a result for example spends 4X as much time as an unvaxxed person in a restaurant, they will have equal risk of resulting hospitalization.

2021-08-17 19:13:00,"It's not clear how much the assumption that a 3rd shot is needed or would be helpful is based on the (normal and expected) decline of antibody titers with time. If memory B cells   and programmed T cells remain there may be no benefit to the 3rd shot of the original vaccine (vs. a new one directed at Delta).It's also not clear from press reports what or whether  the Israelis or Mayo are tracking. If they are comparing current illness severity to Delta as opposed to the historical alpha experience, is more intensity of illness due to Delta itself or the waning of the antibody levels? I hope a panel of reviewers will look at the data and stick to the science. The pressure to make an uninformed decision based on a hunch is huge for the administration and the CDC."

How many more deaths and pediatric cases does the public need to see before anything changes? The fact that the discussion is so politicized does it help making sane arguments for vaccinations.
 Most if the ICU cases are seriously ill and the toll will be steep. These cases were PREVENTABLE. If you cannot be responsible for yourself at least do so for your fellow citizens.
   Insurance companies should make an unvaccinated status as a pre existing condition and refuse coverage. 
   In this public health crisis, the opinions of patients on remaining unvaccinated should be ignored and shots be required for all.
  Short of that, if you are unvaccinated, stay at home and date for yourself."

That has been contradicted in the UK because of the policy of delaying the second dose of both the Pfizer and AZ vaccines to 12 weeks. The UK evidence is that the delayed second doseas a result of vaccine in short supply until more became available has worked quite well.
It might well be that Deaths per million as recorded on the Worldometers website, result in the UK continuing to move down the tables.? Previously they had been one of the worst.. Now heading for a mid table position"
2021-08-17 18:20:54,"Bill de Blasio has now demonstrated beyond doubt that he has complete disregard for New Yorkers' risk of coronavirus, despite his own statement that 2 million New Yorkers are unvaccinated.

This is the opening from the latest NY Times story: ""Those who are 12 and older will be required to show proof of having received at least one dose of a Covid-19 vaccine in order to participate in New York City’s indoor dining, fitness or entertainment venues starting Tuesday. Enforcement will not start until Sept. 13.""

That follows de Blasio's announcement of Saturday's Central Park concert for tens of thousands of people. No masks required. One shot, apparently as late as the day of the concert. No need to use the Excelsior Pass as proof, just a 2x3 card that anyone can fabricate on a home printer.

One shot is not good enough, especially a shot that can be received up to the day of entry. Nor is telling New Yorkers that thy don't have to use the Excelsior Pass as proof, but can show up with an easily fabricated 2x3 card.

I would urge The New York Times, which is our local newspaper, to start asking hard questions about what de Blasio is doing and its impact on New York residents."

Whether they are flying on an Israeli airliner or fighting a virus that can be deadly, Israel is always a step ahead.  Does this mean I think Israel can do no wrong?   Hardly.  But thanks to the US they have the money and thanks to their history they have the motivation to do what it takes to LIVE."
2021-08-17 18:31:10,"I've noticed a lot of people seem to be assuming all the people who don't want the vaccine are MAGA. This assumption of a monolithic group is incorrect.

And it's worth remembering, the vaccine was created under Trump's Operation Warp Speed. He's proud of it and has been telling MAGA people to get it and many have.

The narrative that it's MAGA people seems designed to foment even more division by massively over-simplifying the reality. There are a variety of populations that don't want it for a variety of reasons. 

It's sad and disorienting to see so many Dems/folk on the left not respect the personal health decisions of those populations- including minorities- and instead make them second-class citizens barred from much of public life if they don't get a novel gene-based injection made with seriously shortened safety studies under Trump's Operation Warp Speed..."

I also live in a stupid state (Arizona) where the number of vaccinated people is below the percentage for herd immunity (with a large percentage of anti-vaxxers).

Of course gossip and hearsay do not help, but as Bertrand Russell once said impishly, “Anyone who is certain about anything is certainly wrong.” Russell turned out to be wrong about a great many things, but the arc of his skepticism did include the fear that expensive medical research would be overtaken by vested interests to the detriment of both science and common sense.  He was once asked what he would say if the god whose existence he doubted confronted  him in an afterlife. His response was that he would ask why he was not given more information.

The data is scanty. What is supposed to be accomplished here?  It makes sense to give boosters to the most vulnerable. But if the booster is supposed to halt the spread of infection, I don't see the data that says the booster shots will do that. 
Further, the mRNA technology is new and unknown for long-term side effects. The booster shots create the risk of cumulative negative effects if there is a problem with long term effects in these vaccines. 
As far as I know, the unvaccinated are the ones experiencing severe illness in overwhelming numbers. The vaccinated typically have mild or moderate symptoms, which are comparable to a normal flu. I'm unconvinced that widespread booster shots are necessary or even desirable to counter this. Booster shots are great for drug company profits, though."

2021-08-17 21:31:46,"Ive not seen actual data on waning immunity, but what I have seen is a reduction in effectiveness of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine to prevent SARS-CoV2 infection in those who received two doses of vaccine. With non-Delta viruses, infection prevention was 94% in Israeli vaccine recipients, but down to 64% vs. Delta variant infections. While important, prevention of INFECTION is not the true goal of any vaccine. This concept of ""sterilizing immunity"" is one that is not the standard of effectiveness in a population, but protection from disease leading to serious (or fatal) outcome and reduction or elimination of community transmission is the goal - especially with pandemic infections. The two dose regimen of the current mRNA vaccines do that, even with Delta after two doses. While the waning protection from infection may inform vaccine dosing, I've not seen data showing that antibody or cell-mediated immune responses are reduced at this point requiring more doses or boosting. If we are going to be data driven in decision making, then we need to see the data. With the large Phase III trials for all the current EUA vaccines, and real world evidence from the more than 100 million doses given in the USA alone, it is possible to measure enough people to understand the kinetics of immune responses to SARS CoV2. I'll be curious to see these data, and a full explanation of the justification for additional doses when so much of the world is not able to access any doses at all."
2021-08-17 21:15:35,"It would sure be nice if the CDC/medical community could ID an antibody test, or something people could do, to assess their immune status on COVID.

For one thing, everyone's talking about antibodies.  Antibodies wane over time and, for all we know, that's the body's natural way of preparing itself for future disease outbreaks (i.e. the body decreases serum antibodies as it establishes robust B-cells to produce antibodies if needed, along with memory CD-4 and CD-8 T-cells, to deal with future problems.)

I'm fine with boosters and will gladly get one if my antibodies fall off the map.  But all these meds are designed for the average patient (overweight/obese and don't exercise) with high inflammatory load.

That's not me and the Pfizer vaccination, just like every other med I've taken that affects the immune system, was about 2-3 times more effective than the medical community anticipated. Great for creating antibodies (mine were over 20 on a 1-20 scale) but does a number on the body. 

I continually find myself trying to function in a medical environment where doctors have no clue what's going on with my immune system and overdo it."
2021-08-17 21:35:45,"I'm grateful for the availability of booster shots, but I'd be more grateful for a federal vaccination mandate.

Personal ""freedom"" as imagined by those primarily on the political right is nothing more than selfish disregard for society.  American individualism should not go to the extreme point at which other people's lives are put at risk.

We can defeat this virus, if all of us work together, but continuing to believe in fairy tales and conspiracy theories is literally killing our fellow citizens.  Putting politics before the health and well being of Americans is also killing us, and often the most vulnerable.

We face a very dark future in this country, if those who refuse to be part of our community of citizens are pandered to and allowed to endanger the lives of those of us who have tried to care for our own health, and the health of others too!"
2021-08-17 21:40:26,"“ Pfizer-BioNTech filed data to the F.D.A. on Monday that it said showed the safety and effectiveness of a booster shot. But the data was preliminary, from Phase 1 of a clinical trial. Moderna is on a similar track, exploring the safety and efficacy of both a half-dose and a full dose as a third shot.”

Since when are policies enacted based on preliminary data from Phase 1? As far as I’m aware scientific/medical protocol requires at data from phase 2 and phase 3 trials at a minimum. What possibly could go wrong with jumping the gun?"
2021-08-17 21:26:20,"You're going to have to keep needing booster shots.  And at some point, the government is going to stop paying for them, so you will need to turn to your insurance provider(s) and deal with deductibles and co-pays.

COVID vaccine protection highly likely to wane over time - UK advisers say
July 30, 2021

LONDON, July 30 (Reuters) - The protection that vaccines give against coronavirus infection, and potentially severe disease, is highly likely to wane over time so vaccine campaigns will continue for years to come, scientists told the British government's advisory group.

2021-08-17 21:38:31,"I'm 81 and now worry that a scheduled trip this October may too risky unless I can get a booster shot soon. I'm so angry at the continued resistance of Southern governors who've made the pandemic last longer than it should while killing or more accurately murdering their own citizens with their reckless endangerment of prohibiting mask mandates. It's a not so civil war where the new southern confederates are killing their own unvaccinated people while endangering the rest of the nation. When will they realize that the real war is against the new Delta variant of the coronavirus and not the Democrats? The Republican Party has now become an ""existential threat"" to the lives of all Americans as well as to our democracy.  Is there no way of stopping these agents of death?"
2021-08-17 21:51:56,"Before any American gets three, everyone in the world should have at least one."
2021-08-17 21:02:25,"Within 30 days all U.S. schools will be open. Some schools are currently open and are reporting new cases of covid-19 among students and staff. The Delta variant of this virus is as contagious as the chicken pox virus.Masks (KN-95), social distancing,hand washing and keeping outside in fresh air are more important now since Delta can infect  a person whether they are vaccinated or not. Anyone who is infected will, without a doubt, infect more than one other person if not masked and socially distanced.This virus can kill the person you cause to become infected ( whether it's the person you were in close contact with or someone else further down the chain of contacts). Just because you feel healthy does not mean you are not infected ( think Typhoid Mary). There are too many millions of people yet to be vaccinated ( remember there is no vaccine yet approved for children under 12 and they can die from this virus too) and too many unknowns about the future mutations of this virus    
for us to let our guard down. Get the vaccine to stay alive,avoid brain, lung,kidney damage and/or killing some one else whether that someone is 3 months old or 103. Vaccinated or not, do everything possible to avoid infection."
2021-08-17 21:42:28,Can these boosters be combined with the seasonal flu shot?
2021-08-17 21:54:09,We need to start sooner. Next week would be perfect.
2021-08-17 22:23:54,And the covid money train rolls on. It started with vaccines. The government gave companies billions to produce vaccines. Now booster shots are being produced and more money is being made by big pharma. The cash cow.that covid started out as. Is now the goose that laid the golden egg. Profits over people.
2021-08-17 22:27:15,The boosters should be available at the eight month anniversary of your second shot.  If eight months is the magic number.  This will provide maximum efficacy and minimize the never-ending game of 'who should be first in line'.
2021-08-17 23:36:54,"I’m 66, and I got the first two shots last Spring, so I am not an anti-vaccer. But, I find this a bit troubling. I understand that immunocompromised and older people, who may not mount as robust a response to the vaccine as a younger person, may need a booster. But, all of a sudden, the recommendation is that everyone - even younger healthy people who have a stronger immune response - should get a third dose, and on the same time line. This is something of a surprise. Is it just easier to tell the whole population to follow the same time line? By way of contrast, the flu shot, although an annual shot for everyone who chooses to get it, has a higher strength version that is given to older people. It’s not a one size fits all. I’m not trying to say anything controversial; just kind of wondering out loud."
2021-08-17 22:50:24,Moving the goal posts…again. Let’s focus on getting shots to the unvaccinated and stop this absolute insanity.
2021-08-17 22:19:08,"TX governor Abbot tests Covid-positive. He is vaccinated and has no symptoms. And YET, he is to receive intravenous monoclonal antibody therapy, a therapy that costs tens of thousands of dollars. 

This is WRONG!  It is evidence of corruption within the Texas political and health care systems.  There are patients in the ICU who cannot get monoclonal antibody therapy. And here we have a governor who is against any public health measures and yet who receives preferential treatment."

Why not authorize at 6 or 7 months?"
2021-08-17 23:31:33,"I never stopped wearing my mask out to public places, and I am ready for my booster when it is ready.  I know we are going to be dealing with COVID for awhile, so just trying to do my part."
2021-08-18 00:17:03,"Tonight's NYT e-mail coronavirus letter says that rate of breakthrough cases and breakthrough hospitalizations may be higher than initially thought. This is based on data from seven U.S. states.

I've already returned to, and have no problem with, wearing a mask in the proximity of other people, and being careful about keeping my distance from them.

I do have a problem with Bill de Blasio's cavalier attitude toward public safety with respect to both this Saturday's Central Park concert and new requirements for going to restaurants, gyms, etc. He has apparently decided that vaccination means one shot, and that the shot can be received as late as the of the event. In other words, meaningful vaccination is not required. Nor are masks. Nor is there any explanation of why the new restaurant/gym requirements won't even take effect for another month.

As far as I'm concerned, de Blasio is now part of the problem. I'm in a position to go to Canada, where coronavirus is taken seriously, and where there is both much higher vaccination and far fewer new cases. I'm thinking seriously of leaving New York until sanity prevails and just driving across the border."
2021-08-18 00:55:48,"Are they referring to a booster with the same components as the original vaccine, a combined multivalent vaccine that covers original plus variant, or a variant strain directed at delta?"
2021-08-18 00:44:11,"Reading these comments, I'm really amazed at all the fear still out there in America. Covid-19 deaths in the US remain a tiny fraction of what they were pre-vaccine. The US vaccine marketing campaign WORKED DESPITE THE DELTA VARIANT. Wondering if there are Russian or Chinese bots populating the comments on Covid articles. Everybody will get the coronavirus whether you're vaccinated or not. Now what are YOU, dear American reader, doing about the billions of people who've had zero access to EVEN ONE shot?"
2021-08-17 19:06:26,"So, they said boosters not likely required and indicated that vaccine lasts 12 - 18 months at least, then said boosters may be (most recently, would be) required for immunocompromised individuals, and now claim that booster advised for everyone.  

And the nytimes, Congress, DC agencies wonder why people are not only confused, but no longer trust the government or media?  As a scientist, I understand moving targets, understand changing course with new data.  However, I have watched the politicization of our health agencies for over a year, and the politicization of our media for 15 years; starting to believe a no confidence vote is in order.

I'll likely get this booster, but not because there is data to support it; because I continue to try to keep myself and those around me safe from what may or may not be true.  However, I have a news flash that all in the scientific community know - this virus will never go away, and government agencies prefer vaccinations over treatment; the latter is appalling."
2021-08-23 20:48:28,"One in a thousand children die from covid? Is this an accurate estimate considering most children have no symptoms or such minor symptoms that they aren't even in contact with a doctor? Why wasn't the percent of covid cases are children and the number of children have died out of the total 600,000 plus people in the US? One out of a thousand children dying is horrifying. I think part of the story was left out. Also how many if the children had underlying health conditions."
2021-08-23 23:36:27,Thank you for a very thoughtful approach to discussing this topic with us parents. Here’s to hoping all our babes and families stay safe.
2021-08-23 17:59:27,"Well done and interesting podcast, but what I think it might have been more informative, at least for me. For example when gave the statistics on how many children actual get Covid, you sighted that only 1% of kids under 12 are hospitalized.  What is missing is some context for this stat.  Is it the overall stat from the start of the pandemic or what is happening now, like in the last month.  I would think those numbers could be very very different, but I don't know and it would be good to have the information and/or if you don't have the information than at least put the statistics you do have and are sighting in some context."
2021-08-23 15:23:24,"Thank you for show and for excellent distillation of questions into themes.  However, please consider having your wonderful science reporter pose the questions to an expert vs. trying to answer them as a knowledgeable layperson."
2021-08-24 06:32:25,Thank you for your show! I wanted to comment on the recent Sunday episode “ the vanishing jungle”. It’s very saddening to learn about the forest being cut down for cheap coffee. I’m sure they’ve already thought about this but perhaps the government can pay the farmers to plant back the forest rather than allowing them to continuously chop down trees.
2021-08-24 00:16:27,"The one question that I have, and that I wish the NYT would explain in reporting, is why the World Health Organization and the CDC diverge on their guidance for kids and masks. 

Here, masks are regarded as necessary for kids under 12. In Europe, not so. Many of my European friends are shocked when they hear we are masking elementary-aged kids. So who is right - the WHO or the CDC?"

2021-08-24 23:30:26,"This really papers over the key question of delta on children.  For instance, the % children with symptomatic covid HAS risen compared to pre-vaccine times. This can't be explained by the fact that children make up a large percentage of unvaccinated, when you compare with when all of us were unvaccinated. Ms. Anthes appears to report the 1% number as if it is a) static and b) there is a consensus that delta is not more infectious or dangerous for kids, when i think there is considerable more uncertainty there. I think children with symptomatic covid has risen with delta. Whether delta poses a higher risk for children compared to alpha for hospitalization and severe infection, seems to be less clear, though certainly the general rule that covid is more dangerous for adults than children does hold."
2021-08-25 20:45:10,"I really wish you would have covered more about delta. I still feel like I don’t know anything with the delta and kids. Transmission, what safety measures to take/use, is it more severe? Really didn’t answer much"
2021-08-26 11:18:34,"Please. We have the capacity to deliver 3 million shots a day. We are barely managing 1 million right now.

It is clear there is a group of people who have genuine logistical obstacles -- getting child care, time off from work, etc. to get vaxxed. But, the real obstacle is elsewhere.

Do not underestimate the MAGA besotted. Many of them hate liberals and progressives with a passion. They share the desire of their political leaders to see Biden fail, and are therefore keen to torpedo the national vaccination drive. We have seen news reports of people opposing the vaccine and the science even after landing in the hospital with Covid.

The sad part is they pass the disease onto innocent bystanders, and they have once again blighted the lives of the nurses and doctors.

It is going to be a long hard Fall."
2021-08-26 11:06:08,"It's kind of a sad story. Not that people are getting their vaccines, but the fact that peoples' perspectives only change, when their own lives are in imminent danger.  
The consequence is, that grand problems such as climate change (leaving discussions about causes aside) will only be dealt with when the state of Wyoming is completely flooded. I guess I'd better start saving for at bigger boat :-)"

2021-08-26 11:44:54,"The claim that the U.S. vaccination campaign had a successful August only holds up if one pretends that other countries don't exist, starting with our neighbor next door.

Canada got a late start because it doesn't make these vaccines. Until last month, it didn't have enough to immunize its whole population. It's now 14 points ahead of the U.S. on full vaccination. Toronto is 18.7% ahead of New York City. With the school year fast approaching, Canada has fully vaccinated twice as many teenagers.

Yesterday, the U.S. had 46 new cases per 100,000 people. Nationally, Canada had 7. Democrat-run New York State had 5 times as many new cases as Conservative-run Ontario next door.

Canada not only opened its border to Americans on August 9, it remains on track to open to Europe and elsewhere in 12 days.

The country owes its comparative success to continued use of prophylactic measures (masks, social distancing and coming vaccine passes) as well as vaccination."
2021-08-26 12:00:27,"I served as a healthcare provider for decades, from medical assistant, CNA, and with education, to an RN.  I never worked anywhere else but in some kind of healthcare.  My co-workers were my comrades, my friends.  I looked up to so many of them. 

Then, on August 17, 2021, I saw Registered Nurses from our local hospital walking in our town, in a parade of sorts, in the name of anti-vaxxing.  

Is this “do no harm”?  

What is there to prove?  That we allow healthcare providers the opportunity to get COVID and pass it on to innocent patients?  That we all can make our own choices no matter the affects on those we serve?  

I agree there are circumstances we need to look at regarding vaccinating.  But in general, is it extraordinary to expect walking into a healthcare entity for care that that healthcare entity will provide citizens with vaccinated workers?  

Administrators, step to the plate.  Protect us.  Protect our kids.  Protect our grandmas and grandpas.  Mandate vaccinations.  It is the right thing to do now."
2021-08-26 11:47:16,"I feel it is hard to fathom the kind of hard core resistance to facts on the ground.  But there it is.  The need to cling to your illusions, distortions, and disdain toward intellectuals, liberals, education and science, is written all  over the posture of many people.  I have read many articles about the notion that intellectuals look down on the working class, lesser educated population.  I see the contempt of others toward science and education as far more virulent.  This country has a profound problem of polarization which  is only escalating in  this time of climate change  and complete absence of sanity on the part of many so-called leaders.  What a shame."

2021-08-26 12:27:42,"""The increase in vaccinations has been especially pronounced in states where immunization levels were (and remain) below the national average of 61 percent.""

That's one way to look at it. But take New York, with a 9-point percentage increase and a relatively large portion already vaccinated by June 6, and compare it to Alabama, with a 12-point percentage increase and a relatively small portion of the population already vaccinated by June 6. As a percentage point change in total population, wouldn't New York's 9-percentage point increase be much larger than Alabama's 12-point percentage increase? The population of New York is about 19.5 million. Alabama's? About 5 million."
2021-08-26 13:58:42,"This is what a pandemic looks like when a first world country takes a third world approach to health care.   

Lots of blame is being heaped onto the MAGA folks but let's remember that they've grown up in a country where the availability of preventative health care is inconsistent at best. Couple this with many states refusing to sign on to the Affordable Healthcare Act (Obamacare), the closing of even greater numbers of health care centers (hospitals, etc) over that last decade and you get a recipe for making a bad situation worse than it need be.  

Why not take this opportunity to transform healthcare. Expand Medicare to include children, thereby lessening the cost of insurance for families, fund school nurses to provide preventative healthcare and screenings, and start raising generations that are more healthy.   

People in Canada, Europe and other nations where they have good national health care systems don't just wake up at 21 and say ""gee, what a deal we have in healthcare.""  They have been raised in systems that have taken care of them from day one."

Exclude factors beyond one's control (racism, abuse, poverty) and my guess is we would find consistent proof that much of what goes wrong in one's life is self-inflicted.

2021-08-26 14:04:59,The good news is that the conservative rank and file are beginning to be sufficiently afraid that they are ignoring the deadly advice of the Republican propaganda machine. Even some Republican governors and other leaders are defying the anti-vaxxers.
2021-08-26 12:06:50,"Apparently, Trump loyalists were so brainwashed by him, Fox News, and other conservative media that they were immunized against believing the truth about this pandemic. Until it killed someone they knew. 

I miss the simpler world of my childhood, when we got only one, then two, and finally three television stations. The three major networks were non-partisan, so they were generally trusted. 

We need more leaders who work to unify us, rather than to divide us for their own self-interest. An excellent book about the increased polarization since the 1950s is Upswing, by Harvard's Robert Putnam."

2021-08-26 12:57:57,"There are, of course, several factors that drive vaccine resistance and other aspects of political hyper partisanship, but I will mention just one--what cognitive psychologists call concrete level thinking. People who function at this level understand the world largely, if not entirely, in terms of physically experience. A flooded or burned out home is a meaningful possible indicator of climate change. Climate models and projections are abstractions that are not to be trusted. Ditto for epidemiologists and their projections of Covid spread.

This article contains a clear example of concrete thinking: ""Some communities are seeing Covid close up now,” said Dr. Mandy Cohen, the secretary of the North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services. “They’ve seen it on the news, but that’s not the same as seeing it close up.”"
2021-08-26 13:07:39,"I am surprised and embarrassed by the vaccination record in Ohio. As an older man, I received the second of both doses of Pfizer months ago, and I received a ""booster"" two weeks ago. 

Governor Mike DeWine, with whom I have a lot of political differences, seemed to do a good job of getting people vaccinated. What happened?

The NYT chart and numbers, by the way, are somewhat difficult to interpret."
2021-08-26 13:54:15,"“Some communities are seeing Covid close up now,” said Dr. Mandy Cohen, the secretary of the North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services. “They’ve seen it on the news, but that’s not the same as seeing it close up.”

This is true. A neighbor of mine believes that Covid is either a liberal hoax or a Chinese plot, depending on the day, and steadfastly refused to be vaccinated. That is, until two of her grandchildren were hospitalized with Covid and one needed to go to the ICU. Only then did she grudgingly get vaccinated (I think her kids insisted that she do it). Now, every little ache and pain she has is because of the vax and she feels ""suckered"" by the news that booster shots will be needed. And of course, it's all still a liberal plot."
2021-08-26 13:57:47,Children are not vaccinated.  Schools should not open. How long is it going to take before people wake up to the fact that the virus will go after anyone and our children are sitting ducks?   I feel for parents who have to battle their state officials in Texas and Fla and elsewhere who seem intent on getting people sick.  A travesty.
2021-08-26 14:35:13,"This is really a good way to present this data, but with one caveat: In addition to your map of increase in vaccinations over the previous level, it would be more useful to show new vaccinations by state as a function of the previously unvaccinated. Consider Vermont. There was only a 4% increase as you show it, but among the initial 29% still unvaccinated that represents 13.7% increase! That reduction in the unprotected is the number we should be striving for. 

Then perhaps correlate the current Delta increases not with total population, but with the unvaccinated, correcting for known break-through infections, and see what you get."
2021-08-26 14:49:32,"So there seems to be a correlation between new cases since June, and how many have been vaccinated since June.

It would be intuitive to explain this by saying that a higher number of cases would urge people to get vaccinated, and that certainly would make sense to me.

However, couldn't some of the correlation also be due to vaccination rates in certain states to be lower to begin with? That would cause both higher number of cases, but also leaves more people to get vaccinated.

Just wondering ... anyone have more insight into this? Or if there are other possible explanations for the correlation?"

2021-08-26 11:59:13,"The country should never have stopped the mandates for masking, hand washing and social distancing. The vaccines can mitigate severity of disease, but not the transmission---(just look at Israel).
PSAs stating the importance of  the aformentioned behaviors should have been a priority to help people overcome the urge to 'return to normal'.
This is a total failure, blame who you like."
2021-08-26 14:39:45,"People in the anti-vax movement free-ride all the time.  If 24 out of 25 kids in a classroom are vaccinated, that unvaccinated child is unlikely to get sick.  In early July, it looked like the threshold for herd immunity was getting close.  With the Delta variant, that bar moved significantly higher and the free-riders had to start getting their jabs."
2021-08-26 16:09:54,"It seems overall vaccination rates may not be very important  due to ""clustering""  or the tendency of even a minority of unvaccinated people to  live and socialize together.  That is probably the best explanation for Florida's relatively high vaccination rate and incredibly high death rate.  Herd immunity based on vaccination or natural infection essentially  assumes a stochastic or random distribution of vaccines and infections.  disease can go like wildfire  through an unvaccinated cluster even if it is surrounded by vaccinated groups .  If the clusters connect , as they may across the South the virus simply spreads throughout the whole unvaccinated cluster.   Additional vaccination   outside the cluster has little effect.    To understand the concept imagine a state has population  divided between two islands   Everyone on island A is vaccinated and no one on island B.  The state has a 50% vaccination rate.  but it doesn't matter.  The virus will rip through island B.  Getting the resistant clusters vaccinated is vital"
2021-08-26 15:34:15,"NY Times visual design team really does a great job creating simple, effective, and visually pleasant charts."
2021-08-26 15:43:07,"Unfortunately, the failure of large populations to get vaccinated opened opportunities for the virus to mutate further. The more infections, the more opportunity for mutations. The mutations may allow the virus to get around the vaccines and to break through even to the point of sickening many who have been vaccinated.

The anti-vaxxers may have opened the whole country to a vulnerability that even the CDC and state  health departments did not foresee. 

The Delta variant that is now infecting folks is actually somewhat different from the original one that came from India. New mutations rendered it even more infectious and virulent than the original. The virus is winning the arms race because our social system has created deep divisions in our society that slow full response."
2021-08-26 15:51:43,It's only a matter of time before insurance companies start charging people more for remaining unvaccinated.  Delta Airlines is already charging employees $200.00 more a month for their health insurance if they are not vaccinated.  Others will no doubt follow.  Hopefully this will help people decide to finally get the shot.
2021-08-26 15:53:29,"The increase in vaccinations in Noeth Carolina is not correct.  This article states we are now giving over 100k first doses a week.   The data released by the state shows the max volume of first shots has been about 84k  two weeks ago.

2021-08-26 16:50:48,"Looking forward, I think it's instructive that Canada continues to require masks indoors, and is now adopting vaccination passes and mandatory vaccination. It's doing so despite higher vaccination than the U.S. (66% vs 52%, all ages; twice the number of fully vaccinated teenagers), and a lower rate of new cases, hospitalization and deaths (e.g. 7 vs 47 new cases per 100,000 yesterday).

We should be going in the same direction, but even Democratic politicians are playing games with our health. Canadian vaccination passes, like those in France and Italy, require full vaccination, and derive from a central vaccination database. This is not true of New York City's plan. The New York State Excelsior Pass, which could be used as a true vaccination pass, has been tossed to the wayside. Instead, de Blasio's Key to NY City Pass will expose fully vaccinated New Yorkers to people who have had a single shot only hours before, assuming that they didn't just fabricate the required proof (a standard 2x3 vaccination card) on a home computer. This in a city where two million people remain  unvaccinated.

If yesterday's announcement by Delta Airlines is copied by other businesses, we're in better shape on mandatory vaccination. Delta self-insures, and it says that it will charge unvaccinated employees $200 per month for health coverage. As a country with universal health care as a core value, there isn't a chance that Canada will discriminate on health services against unvaccinated citizens."

To get out of this pandemic mess all of us really need to think hard about what we want and need as a global community and the decide how we want to live as a global community.  And then demand from out political leaders that they legislate policy based on that.  Sadly giving the most privileged nations a 3rd vaccine is not going to help and may only make the pandemic worse.

It looks like a relatively arbitrary point was chosen to begin bolding the numbers at '+11' when California (which is fairly well-vaxinated and is on the lower-end of mortality per capita) is sitting at +10.

A far more important metric are per-capita hospitalizations and mortality.  Despite the multi-week lag, those are still the only two really good indicators for a state and have been for the entirety of pandemic reporting.

And looking at those numbers, particularly mortality, I see some fairly severe discrepancies that make me suspect that some state's reporting of vaccinations and other metrics might be... just a tad off.

If we can get 70-80% of everyone vaccinated the pandemic will probably stop (or be controlled)."
2021-08-26 16:22:04,"From a purely statistical perspective, an 10% increase in vaccinations in California is much bigger than a 10% increase in Oklahoma, because California started with a higher baseline--a higher percentage of people vaccinated.

On the other side of the coin, an increase in infection rates in Louisianna is greater than the same percentage increase in infection rates in Washington (the state) because Washington's baseline infection rate is lower.

The moral is that comparing percentages can be misleading."

2021-08-26 17:40:45,"The problem is that the gains in protection that are derived from vaccinations are only ephemeral. It is true that the U.S. can undertake a Program of Booster Shots (3rd doses of Pfizer & Moderna vaccines), but those too will only provide reliable protection for a few months. As it is, the Booster shots will probably end up being administered only when it's Two Months Too Late, and the Delta and Lambda variants will already be seriously imperiling the country with Breakthrough Infections, that are tending to lead increasingly serious symptoms. At the rate of of mutations, the U.S. will probably need to commence distributing additional (4th Shot) Boosters, before all of the 3rd shots have been distributed. Thus, the U.S. will be like a dog chasing its own Tail. In contrast to the Seasonal Influenza, Covid is somewhat more contagious and transmissible. But, worse, the transmission of Covid is not curtailed or limited by changes in weather, or the turning of the seasons. 
We know that it is necessary to get Seasonal Influenza Vaccines once a Year, on an Annual Basis. However the vaccination only effectively protects against the Seasonal Flu for perhaps 4 or 5 Months. Breakthrough infections late in the ""Flu Season"" are not uncommon. The Covid Boosters will only provide robust protection for 3 or 4 Months, but importantly, Covid epidemics can occur Year-round. Thus, it will be ultimately necessary for the Government to make available new Booster Shots every 3 or 4 Months."
2021-08-26 18:49:20,"I wonder how many of 'new vaccinations' are 3rd shots for health care workers. Officially we can't get our 3rd shot until September (for unknown reason, despite the evidence that we should), although many of us 8+ months out from 2nd shot. As an ER doc, I've intubated 2 COVID patients in these last 2 days many more going to ICU on high flow O2, I need the extra coverage right now, not in a month from now. So I got a 3rd dose. I told CVS it was my 3rd dose, but many people just went in and said it was their 1st. So how do we know how much an impact on the numbers with this phenomenon. Please NYT can you investigate."

And don't get me going on the selection of a lemon color scheme.  This must be sponsored by the Florida Citrus Board.  In the end, the message is buried in what is called ""chart junk.""

2021-08-26 20:54:59,"Are people getting ""unauthorized"" booster shots in Florida?
Absolutely! 
Florida's governor viciously fights every attempt to keep people safe from COVID. And he's winning:
This week, Florida broke its own record for the highest rates of infection and deaths from COVID since this pandemic started here in March, 2020.
To add insult to injury, we have a federal government recommending booster shots after eight months even though the Pfizer research out of Israel definitively shows that immunity is severely compromised by six months.
When government either deliberately puts its people in harm's way or provides frighteningly ineffective guidance on immunity, then all that's left is for individuals to do whatever it takes to keep themselves, their communities and their healthcare workers safe."

2021-08-26 22:57:56,"People can see the ""wet Paint"" sign and yet some won't believe it until they touch it.  This is human nature and this is what we have seen with the vaccination as well.  How to drive understanding without the need for first hand or close experience is part of the underlying problem here.

The messaging has to be quite different than the approach to date (which frankly, the results have spoken for themselves).

First, we need to clearly communicate that this is not an immunisation to COVID (you can still catch and spread COVID once vaccinated).  The benefit of the shot is reducing hospitalisations and deaths (that is a great start, but it is far from the results we have from other vaccinations like the polio vaccine).

Heck, this isn't really a traditional vaccination either given the efficacy has shown to last only months (some as little as 3 months and others as much as 6 months, but boosters are only advised after 8 months, seems like playing a bit of a risky game there, but supply and logistics are the reasons for delaying for eight months)

The dropping of social distancing, the reduced mask use, the reduced tracking and testing, and the reduced amount of washing hands and staying home when not feeling well is why the US and other places have skyrocketed with the new delta variant.  It really is a ""what doesn't kill you mutates and reinfects again to try to spread again"""
2021-08-27 00:51:40,"Fear works to a certain extent but a lot of these people are so unspooled they'd don't believe COVID is a problem even as they lay dying with a ventilator tube down their throat.

Others won't take the vaccine recommended by every competent doctor on earth but they are perfectly willing to eat horse deworming meds they got at the feed supply store because Sean Hannity told them it works. 

And on top of that we have Governors forbidding all safety measures, forbidding businesses and local governments from requiring masks or even asking about vaccine status much less mandating vaccination. 

If this wasn't happening in real time no one would believe it. 

At some point soon the Federal Government is going to have to go All In on Vaccination Mandates.

Direct mandates where they can like air transport, federal workers and contractors and extend the military mandate to the reserves and National Guard. 

After that withhold all federal funding to States that refuse to implement vaccine mandates.

The alternative is Endless Pandemic because sure as the sin rises tomorrow this large collection of imbeciles refusing vaccination will breed up something that beats the current vaccines and then this nightmare starts all over again.

He has also emphasized treatments, some of them bogus, as at least equally important to prevention measures for Covid-19. DeSantis has promoted dubious medical personalities such as Scott Atlas over public health officials such as Dr.Fauci and insttutions such as the CDC and FDA.

How did GOP politics ever get this low?  By following the sneering rants of a thrice-married, morally bankrupt, habitually truth-blind confidence man, that's how.  By defiantly sacrificing his own state's citizens for his own advancement, DeSantis is even worse than the ex-president right now.

Good governance may not be enough for Biden to overcome this wave of GOP obstinance overtaking most red states.  The president should declare martial law in Florida right now.  He can banish DeSantis to the confines of the governor's mansion, and then set about instituting mask mandates and getting the vaccination rates up.  Once Covid is again under control, he can release the governor to the Feds on a charge of criminal negligence.

Enough suffering the foolishness of these politicians who won't do the right thing.  Use the power of the law to pull the rug right out from under them, and take the reigns of leadership away.  Do this enough times, and the GOP nonsense will be exposed for the empty echo chamber that it is, and their governors will fall in line on this pandemic.

This is a national emergency, and the president needs to treat it with the urgency and full resources which it deserves.  And he must utilize all legal means at his disposal to get the country under control."
2021-08-29 19:31:15,"Ron DeSantis is emblematic of the worst aspects of the GOP.   With the advantage of a Harvard education, he plays to the worst ignorance and fears imaginable.  The immorality is palpable.  Like Trump, his followers are his mark.   And many of those followers are themselves unprincipled weak people who use fear and bigotry as substitutes for using their own minds.  Yes, like Charles suggests, they reflect each other but make no mistake it is the educated moneyed members of the GOP driving the train and they know better.  ￼ Of course, this begs the question: how could Harvard and the other Ivy League schools hand agrees to people with such dangerously despicable character?  This list is long: Trump, DeSantis, ￼￼Cruz, Hawley, etc.  They get where they are in large part by flaunting this credential.  It is high time that character and morality again become a critical component of such an education.  ￼"
2021-08-29 20:13:03,"MIamian here. You can't forget DeSantis is backed by two other right-to-die anti-maskers, Marco Rubio and Rick Scott.

2021-08-29 20:12:54,"But I read in this very newspaper that Florida is bad despite the great job that this very newspaper says DeSantis has done in combating COVID by getting vaccines to people.  This very newspaper wrote a very prominent story that ""informed"" readers that DeSantis did a great job and no bad results are his fault because he did everything right!

Just like this newspaper has also informed me that Biden did everything wrong when it came to Afghanistan and Biden is entirely to blame.

Unlike DeSantis, who did everything right according to this newspaper, Biden had lots of better options that would have led to a joyous and peaceful withdrawal from Afghanistan. At least that's what this newspaper informs me is true.

But DeSantis had no good choices according to this newspaper and that's why he did such a perfect job in Florida during the pandemic."
2021-08-29 20:23:16,"DeSantis is a Trump mini-me and the MAGA crowd across the nation will come out in droves to vote for him in 2024, no matter the Covid disaster unfolding in Florida. I predict that Trump won't have the appetite (or health) to run again, so the next best thing is to endorse his mini-me and stay in the spotlight with rallies, which will translate into $. As long as Donald can make money by putting his carbon copy in office and not having to do the work again of President, he'll be happy. Buckle your seatbelts, folks."
2021-08-29 20:43:45,"DeSantis doesn't care about Covid deaths in his state or any other state for that matter.

Republicans don't care about Covid deaths.

Republicans only care about the next election. 

Over at Fox News, there's a worsening case of Biden Derangement Syndrome setting in. Every breathless headline (and every Fox News headline is breathless) is about how Biden has mishandled Afghanistan and how the pandemic is worsening on Biden's watch. Every story hammers at the Biden campaign's message of competence. 

Painting Biden as incompetent on foreign and domestic affairs is how the Republicans peel the Independent and moderate Republican suburban voters who went for Biden in the last election away from Biden and the Democrats in 2022.

The only goal is to retake the House and retake the Senate. 

If the Republicans take the House, it's a good bet that they will impeach Biden. They may even invite Trump to watch the trial from the Senate gallery. Or, maybe they'll invite Trump to do commentary on Fox News during the trial. 

All that matters is the next election. And the election after that."
2021-08-29 20:51:44,"Despite what you said, and the polls finding a majority of people in  Florida are for sensible measures to fight covid, I'm not so optimistic.  What DeSantis cares about is that CPAC voted him the best candidate if Trump doesn't run, and the second best if he does.
I would bet that Trump dumps Pence and runs with DeSantis as VP.  I can't think of any Democrat who could beat that line up, not Biden, Harris, anyone who ran last time.  And Pence basically added nothing to Trump's appeal, while De Santis adds plenty.  Rational arguments don't count in these crazy times."
2021-08-29 21:09:24,"""To keep the spotlight, DeSantis is employing many of the same tricks as Trump:""

Is it really a robust strategy: Trump lost by 7 million votes.

DeSantis won by 34,000 votes in 2018, a margin of 0.4%  and that was before COVID. Ok, he is the incumbent which gives him an advantage but so did Trump. 

I'm of the view the fellow who said, “the definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over and expecting different results” was right.

Might be a few more people might start thinking the same way as me."

And trying to demean DeSantis will only make most of his supporters like him even more, so it is time to stop.                                            

The truth of the matter is, Florida has a much lower rate of deaths per million than NY, NJ, Conn, Mass or Rhode Island.   Look at the numbers.  Wouldn't it be a better bet for the Democrats to give their own constituents something to vote for rather than try to chip away at a man who is supported by his state? 

He is not my cut of tea, but he is smart, articulate, and I can see why Florida likes him.    And unless something changes with the Democrats, we should practice saying ""President DeSantis.""  And strangely enough, even DeSantis himself knows he is a winning ticket, which makes Floridians like him even more."
2021-08-29 21:30:21,"I think there are two really important points made here, which Democrats and all Americans should use against today's GOP.  (I hope the GOP will be reconstituted as a center-right party in the future, but we need to deal with today.) The points are:

1. The GOP has no actual ideas.  Their rallying cry is that they oppose any Democratic idea.  That is not a basis for governing, hence the Trump debacle.  The Republicans have demonstrated their incompetence to govern at every level.  Voters need to affirmatively see what a candidate plans, or they should be voted off the island.

2. The GOP is not fact free because they have a different assessment (facts are immutable, so there can be no alternative facts, just lies), they are fact free because it is impossible to take their positions if you use the facts.  Do we really want to operate that way?.

They say you can fool some of the people some of the time, all of the people some of the time, but not all of the people all of the time.  In the GOP, we are about to see if the adage is still true."

2021-08-29 21:02:00,"When you rely on the politics of fear and anger then you need something for your voters to be scared and angry about.

Conservative movements all over the world have created this extraordinarily destructive dynamic: deliberately make the average person's life worse, blame others for those problems, and then rely on the bias of conservative media and ignorance of the right wing base to get away with it.

The only way out of this is if progressives genuinely improve people's lives when they have the opportunity - and that the media does not give into the temptation of amplifying right wing nonsense for the sake of profits."

Nebraska is hiring nurses that aren't vaccinated.  

Republicans Governors like DeSantis are actually killing people with their continued gaslighting about not wearing masks, and and refusing vaccines mandates.  Now that our school children are headed back to class, 300 kids a day are being hospitalized for COVID.

DeSantis may be the most 'prominent' among republican governors due to his hollow dream of being a fake Trump and win the presidency, but he is not the only one.  In fact, the people in the Mississippi story have caused more damage than DeSantis could dream of.  
Perhaps more 'quietly'.

The appalling, enraging fact is that they get away with it by appealing to some twisted notion of 'independence'  and 'freedom'.  By cutting public education year by year, as people turn to TV.  Rejecting federal funding to combat disease.  The story is loaded with details showing how easily they convince constituents to vote against their interests.

2021-08-29 19:38:24,"When Trump was elected in 2016, the common mantra was that he was using his voters, that they were hapless dupes who were conned. In fact, the reverse was true. His voters were using him as a blunt force instrument against the rest of us. Their support for him was the first shot across the bow in the soft civil war that has started in this country. 

Fast forward to the pandemic. Trumpist anti-vaxxers are using the pandemic just as they used Trump - to harm the rest of us. They have weaponized a once in a century pandemic for just one reason - they want to do whatever they can to harm us, just as they wanted when they voted for the most spectacularly unfit man to ever hold the presidency. 

And now Trump voters have one more useful idiot to weaponize - DeSantis. They want leaders who will do anything - including causing the deaths of hundreds of thousands of us - to ensure that President Biden's administration fails.

Make no mistake. Trumpists are using their anti-vax stance as the next weapon in their arsenal. They want to defeat Biden. They want to ensure that everything the Democrats try to do fails. And what better way than deliberately keeping this nation in the throes of a horrific pandemic? History teaches that it is not that difficult to install dictators in failed states - and make no mistake - this is the objective of Trumpists.

Trumpists see their own deaths as acceptable losses in the war against the rest of us. It is really that simple."

Now available from our governor are T-shirts, beer cozies and cheap mugs with logos ”Keep Florida Free” and “Don’t Fauci my Florida” to further seduce the anti-vax/QAnon crowd. While hospitals were filling up, DeSantis was shouting about ‘Freedom over Faucism. Fla physicians have attributed the surge in infections, hospitalizations, and deaths in the state to the governor’s rush to end public health restrictions.

The theatrical DeSantis tries to divert attention from  economic, environmental/climate problems in Florida by playing to the cheap seats, by preying on those who want to turn Covid-19 public health quarantine measures into outrage and wedge issues and make campaign money off COVID-19 while minimizing the pain of those who have lost loved ones in Florida and across the country. It is dismaying, grotesque, irresponsible , deadly, the idea of spiting ourselves, of harming ourselves in order to “own""the liberals. Gov.

There is more at stake than personal freedom.  And DeSantis, as the protector in chief of his state population, should know this well.  Everyday we make choices that restrict our total freedom in favor of the good of all.  We stop at red lights.  We don't say that it is our right as a citizen to drive where we want when we want.  For public health, historically we as a nation defeated polio and smallpox through massive vaccination programs. We yielded our alleged freedom to choose against vaccination, and in return we were rewarded with a nation and a planet free of these two diseases.  For Covid, the belief that masking and vaccinations are attacks on personal freedom is totally misguided.  It ignores that there is a benefit to all people to follow mandates applied according to medical science.  DeSantis panders to a base of voters by stressing the importance of their alleged right to choose, no matter how unwise the choice might be, and however it puts at risk the community at large.  He should be acting for health of Floridians.  But the Covid statistics for his state show conclusively that DeSantis has endangered Florida's citizens.  To what purpose? His political standing, not the well-being of Florida."

How do you learn to ignore and lie about epidemics and deaths and to contribute substantively to them by blocking or impeding known protocols like masking and social distancing?

DeSantis was given real power as governor.  Other Southern governors also refused to expand Medicaid which harmed hospitals as well as individuals.  They are paying the terrible price now in lives lost.

DeSantis said summer was Covid season in Florida but usually it is fall and winter.  This will only get worse.

I'd like to point out that, as opposed to many others out there, I don't feel as if the unvaccinated are my enemies. But, their collective ignorance is. In fact, it's an enemy of all of ours because it threatens our very survival.

But, while I have some compassion for these unfortunate souls who are filling up hospital beds all over the place, I have none what-so-ever for those who know better - people like Trump, DeSantis, and Carlson for example - but are willing to exploit people's ignorance as a way of enriching themselves politically and/or financially. And this would include practically every Republican who defends being unvaccinated as a ""personal choice"", yet are, themselves, fully vaccinated.

It's almost as if people like DeSantis are saying, ""If you don't want to get vaccinated, I'll support that!"", but at the same time are thinking to themselves, ""I just hope you don't die before you get a change to vote for me again!"".

It shows that their concern for re-election outweighs any other consideration. Even the very lives of those they are supposed to represent - and look out for.

But good intentions are a start to good leadership, to good governance. 
Mr. DeSantis doesn’t have good intentions and he may have lacked them for most of his adult life. His lust for the spotlight, for control and power have blinded him to the most minimal requirements for good leadership.

How insane is it that parents and their educational representatives who wish to protect their children from infection are now needing to openly defy their duly-elected governor who apparently views children as collateral damage in his relentless need to secure the 2024 nomination as the Republican Party's standard bearer.

Thankfully, Floridians are beginning to wake up to the fact that they have a monster in the state house of  who is well on the way to giving the state the dubious distinction of being the deadliest in the country.

Furthermore, they are not protecting their states citizens; they are endangering them and everyone else around them.  It may be a free country but that doesn't mean governors are free to commit murder and that's precisely what is going on here.  

Masks help.  Getting vaccinated helps more.  My being vaccinated contributes to the protection of vulnerable people who cannot be vaccinated.  It's not a personal matter when your actions endanger other people's lives.  I am, quite honestly, on my last nerve with the nonsense the GOP has been spouting about this pandemic.  I'm tired of hearing medical professionals who know better, claiming that vaccines are dangerous, masks are useless, and other idiocies.  

How many times must we hear some self proclaimed expert say I'm not a doctor but and then say something completely wrong before we realize that they are not trustworthy, they do not know what they are talking about, and that for some Americans, our being vaccinated and wearing masks is a matter of life and death for them?

This sort of thing occurred during the early and middle years of the AIDs epidemic.  Our own president, Ronald Reagan, said some fairly ignorant things.  There was no excuse then and there's no excuse now.  

DeSantis and Abbot and the others ought to be recalled.  They have done nothing to help their citizens."

Right now a thousand or so people are at the festival in the park across the street from my house. To hear DeSantis and many of the Republicans in our legislature, you’d think we were all in chains suffering under the heel of the “biomedical security state.”"
2021-08-29 23:13:53,"Virtually no one who is vaccinated is dying, or even getting seriously ill. And DeSantis strongly supports vaccines. 

So you can play politics with this all you want. The bottom line is people in FL -- and everywhere else -- need to get the jab. Now. Or suffer the consequences. 

Masking is fine, but in the end, ""slowing"" the virus spread just means prolonging the pandemic. Get the vaccine or get the virus. Either way, let's all get it and move on."

 DeSantis' presidential ambitions. He, Abbott and Noem will be competing for the GOP nomination based on whose state had the most COVID fatalities (which means they had the most freedom - to die).

Noem can't keep up in this race given the small SD population, but Abbott and DeSantis have millions more they can prevent from taking steps to protect themselves. The more people die the more they rake in campaign donations, so the GOP Death Strategy is working."

I do not see even an attempt at leadership for the state as a whole---not a hint of praise for our medical staff under assault--not even an attempt at coherent policy. I can only see this, and the Trump phenomenon, as something even worse that adversarial politics: a breakdown in rapprochement with reality, abandonment of social cohesion, and acceleration of a breakdown in functionality."
2021-08-29 23:33:52,"One thing that has become very clear over the past year is the total inadequacy of science education in this country.  Science is not an alternative belief system.  Empirically validated scientific hypotheses are not the same thing as deeply held beliefs.  People who know anything about how vaccination works, and about the long history of research into mRNA vaccines, are not going to be talking about how these vaccines were produced ""too quickly"" to be safe. People who know anything about metals and magnetism are not going to be claiming that the COVID vaccine ""magnetized"" them.  It's not necessary for every graduate of our school system to know enough about science to become a scientist, but it definitely IS necessary for every graduate of our school system to know enough about how science works to make rational, informed decisions.  We are now witnessing the consequences that ensue when too few people have that level of understanding."

Putting aside the responsibility of protecting their supporters and the criminality of what they say and do, on the basis of sheer calculation, their actions make no sense whatsoever.  The number of their supporters is dwindling. Who would be left to vote for them?"
2021-08-29 23:39:52,"Very well-written column, Mr. Blow.

And I agree with your early point:

""Republican politics have become oppositional politics: Deny the science, demean the media, own the libs. Conservatives are less defined by what they are for than by what they are against.""

Republicans aren't FOR anything; they're just against whatever Democrats/liberals/progressives are for.

There is some of this among Democrats as well, but nowhere near the extent to which it exists among Republican politicians and voters.

As many have said, we are in a new civil war.  It hasn't broken out into armed conflict yet (except for Jan. 6th and perhaps some of the mass shootings), but we are definitely a nation divided.  And as Lincoln said, a nation divided cannot stand.

Not even a common enemy such as a pandemic could unite us.  That too was subsumed by the contemporary civil war.

If we don't find some way to heal, some way to bridge the divide, we will fall apart--socially, economically, violently.

I pray for our nation every day.  We don't deserve divine intervention, but I ask anyway."
2021-08-29 23:43:00,"The virus doesn't care about our freedoms, the Constitution, our political parties, or what we do with our day. The virus has no conscience and few natural barriers to invasion except those that humans devise... like masks and vaccines. Failure to heed the facts puts everyone at risk."
2021-08-29 23:45:27,"Please don't confuse Republicans and  conservatives. That is a drastic insult to conservatives. Unnecessary mass death is not conservative. Radical right-wing Republican againsters own it.

If such governors as deSantis and Greg Abbott persist in policies which cause mass unnecessary deaths, two remedies exist. The White House could remove them from office. If you consider that drastic, how drastic is thousands of people dying who shouldn't be? 

Or, they could be stripped of the power to decide about public health, during the Covid emergency. Congress could authorize the CDC or HHS to appoint regional epidemiologists, qualified scientists, to make local decisions about mask and vaccination mandates and lockdowns, 

Actually, politicians who are not cynical (don't laugh!) might embrace that, because it would relieve them of responsibility for bad decisions. Unfortunately DeSantis and Abbott, for example, are as cynical as the day is long."
2021-08-29 23:47:53,"It is unfortunate that often it takes deaths of family or friends to get through to the unvaxxed.

A relative of mine was just vaccinated after a good friend of his, seemingly healthy 20 year old daughter died from Covid.  Until today all I have heard is I’m living in fear or, most recently, “Faith over Fear.”

At some point, sadly, there will be enough deaths which will marginalize DeSantis. A tragedy."

2021-08-29 23:58:57,"DeSantis's rise, or lack thereof, will depend on what triumphs: hard, cold facts of Covid deaths, or MAGA rhetoric about freedom. Facts are stubborn and likely to endure versus rhetoric that is ephemeral. I am betting that the legions of people hospitalized and dying in Florida will blunt any DeSantis political momentum. Most people will be appalled by his mishandling of the pandemic, and those most likely to support him are the ones dying."
2021-08-30 00:06:11,"""As DeSantis said in early August, 'We can either have a free society, or we can have a biomedical security state.' He continued, 'And I can tell you: Florida, we’re a free state. People are going to be free to choose to make their own decisions.'"" Essentially DeSantis is saying Floridians who reject masks and vaccinations should be free to infect others, including children who cannot yet get the vaccine. Calling for freedom to endanger the health and well-being of others might play well with Trump and his extremist base but it is amoral. However, when it comes to political ambition morality apparently is not a concern to DeSantis."
2021-08-30 00:06:42,"It is beyond maddening.  It is beyond reason.  It's at the terrifying level now about how heartless elected officials like DeSantis are and how they enable an even bigger war within our population than ever in my lifetime.  We've spent years witnessing the callousness of many in the Trump Party.  We've watched how they've spewed hate, bigotry and ignorance, while being for nothing other than their own political power.  And the sad thing is that we have throngs of citizens cheering them on -- despite the science, despite the facts, despite how Floridians are leading the numbers of in terms of COVID-19 sickness and deaths.  But as my husband says, the people get the government they deserve...and Florida has more than its share of such leaders -- from Rick Scott, who stripped  the words ""climate change"" out of official state documents to Marco Rubio who preaches the bible when he simultaneously preaches hate.  Yet, one would have thought we can align around our nation's children.  We should be able to.  Yet, in 2021, it's easier said than done."
2021-08-30 00:11:36,"Isn’t this the same state that edited yearbook pictures of girls that the school thought were dressed to li provocatively?  

So parents have the “freedom” to decide not to send their kids to schools in masks. But they don’t have the “freedom” to send their daughters to school in a tank top on a hot day."
2021-08-30 00:11:39,"OK.  Let's take Desantis's argument:

“And I can tell you: Florida, we’re a free state. People are going to be free to choose to make their own decisions.”

Does that mean that Floridians can now drive drunk with abandon and hit people, because it's a free state?  Can they now drop a lit match in a dry area, causing wildfires?   They're free, they should have that right, right?

How do you argue against such a low level of intelligence, of intellectual honesty?  You can't.  It's not about that.
 They will never admit that your freedom to swing your fist ends where my face begins.  

If Florida is truly a free state they should get rid of all laws that protect people from harm.  But of course, we know, as Charles said, that this is political posturing - to appear the strongest and most fearless is impressive to the base.  

The best thing we liberals can do is to let the children - the party that would tolerate infantile thinking and behavior - to self-destruct in elections.  That's the only hope.

The problem is that the right has ego-identified with Trump, the base, and the ""own-the-libs-at-any-cost"" tribe, and they are going down with the ship."
2021-08-30 00:12:24,"for anybody with either a half brain, or who's still sane witnessing the desantis behavior, it's crystal clear that he's committing a crime on a state- wide range.

the trump scandal was first, withholding  the then already available horrible news of the approaching pandemic, and then - denying / encouraging the Masses to IGNORE  the facts ( or as Charles here put it ""very few facts helped Trump, so he waged war against facts themselves. He denied, diminished and dismissed them"".

now we're facing the Desantis scandal. 
no need for that.

whomever brought the court case against Desantis which ended with the judge OVER_- RULING the Gov., would do well to transfer the whole case into the hands of the courts - where it clearly belongs.

politicians have already proved beyond any doubt that they're NOT interested in protecting the public.

so - lets take the essentials of ensuring the public's health  and deposit it in the hands of judges who, hopefully, will rule as that other judge has ruled against Desantis.

one suspects ( definitely hopes ) that elementary sanity still exists in our courts."
2021-08-30 00:15:15,"Personally, I don't understand why there isn't a massive media campaign running in each of these poorly-governed states, of which Florida and Texas are the most egregious. 

Since so many of the non-vaxxers appear to be of similar ilk, design carefully-crafted ads that appeal to the lowest-common denominator of residents in each state, and let them take to the streets to oust their leaders long before they run for re-election. Unfortunately, they haven't figured out yet, that their own lives depend upon it."

2021-08-30 00:24:42,"Public health authority is not rested in Governors. They have their own professional hierarchy. The problem in Florida has little to do with the hubris of a politically ambitious governor, but the lack of confidence in a major institution in America, healthcare, both public and private. It's easy to blame DeSantis for the COVID scourge; he's a public figure, but he has little control over what the average Floridian, or according to your article, below average Floridian thinks about masks, vaccinations, and in general, the pandemic. 

Politicians in this country usually lead from the middle—not your intrepid figures at the head of the charge, nor your back office toady rubber stamping the public view. We have one of the latter here in Pennsylvania.

If you want to inspire people to do right for their own and neighbors' health, you have to address the culprits, and those are the white smocked medical professionals and the MBA suits in the health insurance industry, both of whom hide behind politicians to bolster their high salaries and profligate lifestyles. Over the last forty years, the medical industry has whittled away the public's faith, and much more than the combined GOP governors. Medical treatment in America now ranks near the bottom of the first world's list."
2021-08-30 00:26:01,"The Orlando Sentinel reports that hospitals in central Florida have banded together and ordered 14 more portable refrigerated morgues, needed because there's no more room for bodies at either the hospitals or the local mortuaries.

DeSantis has so far refused to declare a state of emergency that would activate the Florida Emergency Mortuary Operations Response System (FEMORS), which would release more portable morgues. This is why hospitals are having to fend for themselves to get more morgues in the middle of a morgue shortage.

Alabama and Texas are better prepared: they have positioned mortuary trailers in preparation for surges of the bodies COVID-19 victims. But Florida? ""Not our problem"", says the state."
2021-08-30 00:31:41,"DeSantis followers are not going to listen to Biden because he's a Democrat and as you say, it's a Fox-induced culture of opposition.  Whatever it is, they're against it.  Of course it helps if it's something they don't want to do in the first place.  

It might help to contact those who've lost friends and family to Covid and see if they can talk some anti-MAGA sense into people before Delta comes for them.  A dying declaration might be more powerful than DeSantis' political aspirations."
2021-08-30 00:31:59,"Mr. DeSantis has pretty well mishandled the vaccination issue and as a result has probably given up the nomination.  In the belief that Mr. Trump cannot become the nominee for a whole host of reasons, it becomes likely that Tom Cotton will be the candidate.  Mr. Cotton unites Republicans to a degree not appreciated by the opposition; Democrats look out!"
2021-08-30 00:34:14,DeSantis is fighting the need for a concerted effort to fight the pandemic with masks and vaccinations along with avoiding crowds.  DeSantis and his GOP inspired personal responsibility mantra is only half of the story and the weak half for sure. It relegates the voters to ignoring their responsibility to each other by wearing masks and getting vaccinated which is absolutely necessary to beat this virus. One on one with the Virus is a fool’s game propagated by the Republicans. WE must ALL work as ONE to cure this disease.
2021-08-30 00:42:40,"The U.S. as a whole is managing the pandemic poorly, and essays like this give blue state readers an unwarranted sense of satisfaction.

Having interests in both the US and Canada, I know that the risk of coronavirus is much higher in New York than in Toronto and Montreal, and that pandemic mismanagement here is a big part of the reason.

The latest is de Blasio’s so-called vaccination pass requirements. Used at his Central Park concert, at this week’s US Open Tennis Tournament, and in the upcoming Key To NY City Pass, these in fact expose fully vaccinated residents to people who may have had their first shot only hours before. Because de Blasio has dumped the Excelsior Pass, there is also nothing preventing people from fabricating proof of their single shot on their home computer.

Meanwhile, Canada is going ahead with true vaccination passes, similar to what France, Italy and Denmark have done, both federally and provincially.

The Canadian federal pass will ease international travel and be a requirement for domestic air travel. The provincial passes will be required for non-essential activities such as going to restaurants and sports events. The three most populous provinces - Quebec, Ontario and B.C. - are already onboard, with Quebec's pass coming into effect in 3 days.

It’s continued use of masks indoors and new measures like these, not just Canada's higher vaccination rate, that explain why Canada has far fewer new cases, hospitalizations and deaths per 100,000 people"

My current theory is that they simply don't know about it even though it is happening right under their noses. I'm thinking (guessing) that local TV news stations are covering it, but no one in the ""base"" is watching that, and local newspapers to a great extent either don't exist, or simply are not read. The ""base"" then gets all its news from Fox (national) or from the Internet. I would be interested in comments from others readers as to why devastating *local* reality seemingly has so little impact on *local* thought and behavior."
2021-08-30 00:55:55,"Three points in rebuttal to this article, and in general, the left's handling of the pandemic: 

1) If life always is more important than liberty, then why isn't, say, the flu vaccine required, or stores banned from selling tobacco or candy when we know it's bad for people? Because it isn't. There has to be a balance, and the fact that we haven't reached one yet is OK. Just because you have reached a conclusion doesn't mean it's the right one, and yelling at the other side certainly won't help anything.
2) The vast majority of the deaths are among the unvaccinated, and almost all of them are that way by choice. In other words, they decided to take a chance, and if it fails, it is not really on us to go out of our way to stop them. Sure, ""my liberty ends where your nose begins"", but they basically punched themselves in the face. So why abridge our liberty?
3) I think everyone recognizes that the coronavirus is not going away until it infects everyone, so the only thing preventative measures (masks, social distancing, event restrictions, remote learning etc.) are going to do is change whether they get infected two months from now or two years from now. So (as someone who was plunged into a deep depression as a result of these exact measures) I think it is folly to force painful acts onto others just to delay the inevitable by a year or two.

But I would love to hear why I am wrong (assuming I am)."
2021-08-30 00:57:31,"I really don't like Desantis or the Republicans, but I do think Dems should be a little careful with the confidence  implicit in their criticism now.  We have short memories.  I recall it was just about this time last year the NYT and its writers were criticizing Desantis' policies and the large increase in fatalities in Florida, only to have NY exceed Florida's daily deaths a few months later.  Perhaps NY will avoid the same thing this year because it has a few months to get everyone vaccinated and learn the lessons of last year, but we will see."

There should be medical exemptions to this requirement but extremely limited or no religious or other exceptions.  If we had a functioning Congress without a filibuster that cared about the public interest they could pas this law under their commerce clause power and it would probably be constitutional.

At that time, DeSantis will say, “ What pandemic” and forget that he presided over the largest Covid disaster of any state.

This guy is slippery and adds to the list of Yale and Harvard educated GOP from these schools such as Ted Cruz and Josh Hawley.

""The 21% lower incidence in schools that required mask use among students was not statistically significant compared with schools where mask use was optional.""

I think that it is foolish for the governor to ban mask mandates, but we shouldn't be given some false sense of security that we are completely safe from harm by wearing a mask.

Maybe there are other variables at play that have produced the high Covid case rate in Florida. I would guess, for example, that millions more travel to and through Florida than many other states. Maybe the mask position of the Governor is indeed the problem. Still, just makes one think that we need a Federal Mandate when it comes to dealing with a deadly pandemic. It can’t be left entirely to the States, as there are some real cowboy Governors out there- both Democrat and Republican."
2021-08-30 02:03:24,"According to the Jerusalem Post, the new variant C.1.2 has more mutations than any other variant, including some that help it evade anti bodies, and its percentage of infections is increasing month by month.
Since it has already spread to other countries, this shows perils of vaccine nationalism of some governments hoarding vaccines. If vaccines had been distributed fairly, we might not now be facing this danger, which scientists are now studying and evaluating.
As experts have told us, Covid is constantly mutating, and the more infections the worse the danger of even worse dangerous mutations that may make current vaccines ineffectual.
We should be aware of the fallacy of composition. While this government may be irrational in contrast with a reasonable person, it does not mean that the politicians are acting in any way irrationally. They simply can't avoid the incentives and constraints facing them.

Because there is no hiding from COVID. We will all get it. Multiple times in our lives. All of us. and once kids have access to vaccines, there’s nothing left to wait for to get back to pre-Covid life. Unless we do want to live in a bio medical security state forever.

Choices have consequences. And as those unvaccinated would learn in spades, freedom isn't free.

I'm waiting to see if the Gulf Coast is going to turn down federal disaster aid for Covid-Ida (Covida) because they think government is the problem, not their small minds."
2021-08-30 02:36:18,"Ron DeSantis stood at the site of the Surfside building collapse, where 99 people ultimately perished, and called it a tragedy.

Ron DeSantis stands idle while more than 200 people are dying daily from COVID; his only actions are to blame others for the consequences of the decisions he alone has made.

This is no leader. This is a political opportunist, plain and simple. I just hope Floridians can see through him at the polls next election."

2021-08-30 02:42:50,"You can't explain DeSantis's behavior by saying he wants people to vote for him. If that is what he wanted, he would not set up his followers to become deathly ill.

More likely, he believes he does not need votes to be elected. He needs only to please a few oligarchs who have funded him. They are who he works for.

DeSantis's well-publicized decisions all point to the destruction of public institutions. Schools, universities, hospitals.

Why would any wealthy oligarch (yes using the term is a generalization) want to see public institutions destroyed? To further advance privatization, own more basic services, and continue to profit."
2021-08-30 02:46:23,"Could one major reason behind vaccine and mask resistance simply be that, as a nation, we are spoiled and don't want to make any sacrifices for the common good?

The coronavirus came on like a car crash, sudden and utterly unexpected. Most of us who have our financial heads above the basic middle class needs spend a lot of our time seeking comforts: good food, good restaurants, vacations that would have made our parents and grandparents think only of the very rich, nice cars, big comfortable houses. We are wrapped in our search for comfort, for a better slice of everything we can get. Suddenly, a bunch of scientists were saying, STOP!, you can't have all those things any more, at least not for a while.

The other problem, extended greatly by the Delta variation of the virus, is there is no end in sight. We are not being asked to give up stuff for 90 days. The point of release from restrictions is over the known horizon: who knows when it will come?

Overarching all of this is a lack of leadership, a lack of kind and helpful voices offering repeated assurances that it is worth it and it will, surely, one day come to an end. Instead, we had Trump saying over and over, ""It will go away. I promise you, it will go away."" (Trump's promises, like when he said, ""believe me"", were a verbal tick meaning he could not promise anything.)

So millions of people are angry, but what are they angry about? To whom can they address it? Anyone making them less comfortable, apparently."

How actors like DeSantis have managed to convince vast numbers of our citizens to roll back the clock of medical science and public health a couple hundred years is a masterstroke of propaganda and manipulation. Read Orwell's prescient essays on totalitarianism for their playbook.  

The real question - the unanswered question - is how this nation will deal with these malevolent figures.  If they've managed to successfully con parents and adults into willingly rejecting life-saving care, they are clearly capable of worse."

In Florida last week the equivalent of 4 commercial airliners crashed with the support and endorsement of the governor of Florida.  The crashes will continue for some time to come in Florida.  Why haven’t the people of Florida called for DeSantis to be held accountable for those largely preventable deaths?
2021-08-30 03:13:30,"From the start of the COVID pandemic, Republicans have fretted about how this will impact their financial backers - the stock manipulators, speculators, monopolists and offshore tax evaders who comprise most multi millionaires nearly all the billionaire class.

Anything the government does to prevent the spread of the virus has financial ramifications for these people. They are very intolerant of failure on the part of their employees and right wing politicians are definitely their employees. 

It would be interesting to listen in on the phone conversations that people like DeSantis and Abbott have had with their major donors.

Let the unvaccinated-by-choice bear the full consequences of their ""freedom"" on their own and rely 100% on their ""thoughts and prayers."""
2021-08-30 03:27:15,"It's just political arithmetic.  For every Covid death in Florida, De Santis solidifies his leadership in the eyes of 1000 members of Trump's base.  (Numbers are hypothetical, but you get the point.)   This is based on the fact that for most people, as long as hospitalization and death don't befall them or their family, they don't really care.  Their political and cultural prejudices will continue to guide their choices.  The 2024 presidential election in Florida is already wired, so De Santis probably doesn't have to worry about the Floridians who are mad because their parents and other family members have been hospitalized or died.  Sad state."
2021-08-30 03:35:39,"Agree completely with Charles Blow.  That a political party would take a negative position on science and medicine, refusing to protect the people of Florida from the clear and present danger of the Delta variant is inexcusable.

How is it possible that a man possibly responsible for over 6,500 deaths in a month from Covid--that would be Ron DeSantis--is not held to account?  The callous disregard for human life is monstrous, making DeSantis  a monster.  If the death rate of 227 lives a day from Covid continues, the total killed by the pandemic by the end of a year would be 80,000 +/-.  We'd have to look back to notorious war criminals to find similar atrocities.  

While DeSantis is obviously not solely responsible for the high number of patients who succumb to the virus, by attempting to block the wearing of masks he is enabling the virus to run rampant, leaving too many people vulnerable to a notably contagious variant of Covid."
2021-08-30 03:39:49,"DeSantis supporters have nothing left but to cling to their desperate idealogical sycophancy. There are no policies, no prospects and no future.

All the while, we watch on helplessly..."

He is an immediate public threat and should be removed from office by force if necessary."
2021-08-30 03:42:45,"DeSantis has hired and listened to Trump's covid advisors.  He endorses the Great Barrington Declaration (let the elderly take shelter or get vaccinated while the young go to work or school and maybe get sick).  I'm surprised he's been neutral about ivermectin.  One of his advisors on masking is a big fan.

DeSantis continues to claim that Florida is vastly safer than New York, in particular.  

However, shortly before the mask ban was at least temporarily stopped (DeSantis promises to appeal), my county's conservative school board voted to require masking in grades K-8.  It's also closed the elementary school serving the county's wealthiest neighborhoods because the staff were getting sick, fast.   Much of Florida is also at a turning point for the number of people who know people who have sickened and perhaps died.  I have not yet seen an analysis of how the delta outbreak is affecting the numerous pockets of low vaccination rates, mostly in poor, often rural zip codes."
2021-08-30 03:47:56,"Of the 247 deaths from Covid-19 in Florida today, 245 of them were very likely caused as a direct result of people exercising what Mr. DeSantis refers to as ""personal freedom"". Let me explain.

The incidence of breakthrough infections - which are those in which a fully vaccinated person gets infected thereby allowing that individual to become a vector to infect others - is less than 1%.

Which means that, you guessed it, over 99% of all Covid-19 infections that are occurring right now are being caused by people who aren't vaccinated.

And that means that 99% of current Covid-19 deaths are the result of people exercising what Mr. DeSantis calls their ""personal freedom"". Which, you have to admit, is a rather polite way of describing someone's ability to infect and kill others with a preventable disease.

I can't imagine how quarantining someone with Ebola would be met by someone with DeSantis' conception of personal liberty."
2021-08-30 03:47:59,"Ron DeSantis is making us reluctant to return to our house in Florida. His petulant opposition to mask mandates and even social distancing has made Florida a hotbed of Covid as the Delta variant surges.  He is willing to jeopardize the lives of Floridians to obtain campaign contributions from his supporters who insist on their freedom to infect others with the virus while ignoring the majority’s plea to be free of Covid.  

DeSantis is responsible for the Florida surge in Covid cases, and as with Trump, facts and science can never stand in the way of his political ambitions.  Perhaps he will hold rallies at hospital doors where many Florida hospitals have exceeded their ICU capacity.  DeSantis is a danger to public health, and many may be reluctant to enter the state as long as he continues his crusade against reason and facts."
2021-08-30 03:51:40,In a state that is always in play as a swing state the risk of COVID remaining and continuing to wreak havoc in the older population plays against the GOP.
2021-08-30 03:52:38,"Yes, we had buffoons like Trump, Abott, Noem and DeSantis to muck the messaging up, but linking this to fatalities isn’t as easy as Charles Blow makes it seem as governments much friendlier to public health in Europe and Canada have struggled with Covid surges, some of them as bad as any we’ve suffered here. Factors determining the infection rate, in the absence of drastic travel restrictions and border closure with contact-tracing program in those countries that acted quickly from the start, aren’t known well enough to render the comparisons we’re making between jurisdictions predictive.

The reality is the hazard is everywhere. Even the low-prevalence are being forced into alerts by the virus’s repeated invasions, and in places like Florida where alerts aren’t called it becomes important to follow the epidemiologists’ advice regardless of what the politicians say. Get vaccinated. Don’t attend crowded events just because you see young’uns getting away with it. Use a mask in public. I’m glad some schools and businesses are ignoring elected leaders to impose their own mandates, as universal compliance is what gets results. Now they’ll thrash it out in court, I suppose."
2021-08-30 03:53:58,"I'm having trouble corroborating this.  Apparently, the folks who run Regeneron are among DeSantis's largest campaign donors, and also are setting up monoclonal antibody clinics throughout Florida.  Cynically, if people don't mask up or vax up and then get infected, they can go to one of these shops for treatment before the coronavirus takes hold and sends them to a hospital.  The state reimburses Regeneron, which in turn presumably kicks a little something to DeSantis.  Does someone out there have a better handle on this than me?"
2021-08-30 03:56:03,"I believe DeSantis support for personal freedom is genuine, if he makes it a state law that paying taxes is voluntary. Else, he is simply letting people die to save his political skin."

2021-08-30 04:01:02,"Last week, we saw the Times piece with the interview of the man in the hospital who ""wanted to keep his liberty"" by refusing the vaccine. He died 12 days after the interview at 52. He did have the freedom to choose to die. I see that as a very sad choice. 

The people who truly, deeply, powerfully believe that the election was ""stolen"" and that refusing to be vaccinated is a way to ""stay free"" are passionate about those ideas. This is a powerful form of brainwashing perpetrated by media types, social media, maybe their church, and local groups and they can't be dissuaded by something as mundane as facts. 

Mr. DeSantis is clearly not interested in following science or any rational thought, and many millions of his fellow Floridians think he is doing a great job. That this is possible, let alone popular, is astounding. 

How do you counter such profound ignorance? If the Dems could figure that out it would make things a lot easier but they have no clue. Just as Biden had no clue what a can of worms he was opening with the Afghanistan exit, so do those who won't wear a mask and refuse vaccination also have no clue as how much longer this mess will continue thanks to their lack of responsibility. Live free or die, as they say in New Hampshire, and maybe now in Florida and Texas and all the other places where deaths are rising every day. What a corruption of that idea!"

Except when people decide something that might be politically inconvenient for the governor. (Like when the majority of Florida voters decided former felons should regain their voting rights. He and his GOP statehouse took it upon themselves to add heavy financial requirements.)

The Florida governor and his guru, the original TFG, appear to have figured that elevating their voters' choices over everybody else's was a cheap route to political advantage.

What could be more cynical than calculating that people will stop dying in plenty of time to avoid becoming an issue in their next campaign?

But it's their determination to stay on (their own) course that makes these decisions so tragically expensive to everyone."

2021-08-29 20:56:53,"This much is clear: DeSantis' behavior is criminal. He is letting his own citizens risk death so that he can advance he twisted idea of freedom. Does he wear a seat belt when he drives, does he wear a seat belt on and airplane, does he have home insurance or car insurance? This things are mandated by law for the express purpose of protecting everyone. What is wrong with this man?"
2021-08-30 01:31:16,"People, it's not just DeSantis. It's local government officials who also discredit and demean the COVID vaccines, and advise people in public forums to not get the vaccine.

I have seen it happen, I have heard it happen, and I've covered it for a local newspaper, and it's the most irresponsible stuff I've seen a public official do. 

My only hope is that at least 52 percent of the folks in my county in Florida have gotten the full vaccine series. We have a chief of the county's Health Department who continues to say that the only sure way to avoid ending up dead of COVID is to get the vaccine, and these smarmy county commissioners then counteract what she says and tell people that it's dangerous to get the vaccine.

At school board meetings, there are two people who insist it's not happening and make fun of the doctors and nurses who are laying it all out on the line in the name of public health.

It hurts when I read about someone who trashes the vaccine and then hear that he or she is very sick or dying of COVID. When I heard the vaccine was available, my first response was that we were saved and soon life would resume. 

No one should suffer like a COVID patient suffers. No one.

I wear a mask in public just in case I am a carrier, and make sure it's on right. Why? Because I care."

Everybody should be choosing these.

As the article points out. It's politics. It's the culture wars and has been going on for 40 years.

Unfortunately, this Covid battle of the culture wars is costing real lives.

We have had 637,000 deaths so far.

If we had the same deaths per 100,000 of Canada, we would have had 248,000 deaths.

390,000 Americans died from Covid who didn't need to."

The reality is that DeSantis has a losing hand but because he's playing with house money from US taxpayers he'll keep gambling with the lives of Floridians.

His gamble for the Republican nomination may pay off but in a general election he'll lead his tribe to yet another defeat as independents and moderates -- the decisive margin in any national election -- will reject his Trumpian craziness just as they rejected Trump the last time around.  He's boxed himself in as yet another extremist banking on lies to seize power.

I have a Republican neighbor who supported Trump who told me about Biden pushing for dental care and hearing aids as part of Medicare.  He was genuinely excited at the prospect of expanded Medicare benefits, which I was oblivious to.  

It was a eureka moment -- to have my Republican neighborhood excited about Democrats actually helping people instead of Republicans oozing division and blind opposition.  Amazingly, he was actually critical of the chorus of Republicans carping at Biden's exit from Afghanistan. This is a guy who had Trump yard signs up in 2016.

If Democrats keep their eyes on the prize and actually deliver tangible benefits for most Americans, I think a positive political shift is very possible.

In the meantime, I'm not drinking Florida orange juice."

Governor DeSantis as attempted to deny everyone and every business --from public schools to cruise ship companies -- the opportunity to save lives.

Given that Florida already requires numerous vaccinations for children to attend school, the governor has reached the pinnacle of cynical and deadly hypocrisy.

Ron DeSantis wants to be president, and he believes that he needs to be the politician that appeals most to Donald Trump's base.

Apparently, nothing else matters:

Not the lives of schoolchildren, the aged, and the vulnerable. 

Not the truth.

Not the loss of his own soul."
2021-08-30 00:34:12,"Charles M. Blow and other opinion writers need to include Iowa in their condemnations of GOP governors who are killing people by their Covid indifference. Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds got the Republican-dominated legislature to pass a bill forbidding mask mandates well before other red states. She signed it after midnight on a school night and made it immediately applicable, throwing schools and parents into a panic the next morning. She returned $95 million in federal money earmarked for Covid testing, quit daily reporting of Covid infections/deaths, has overseen a half-hearted vaccination effort with predictably mediocre results, and is requiring all schooling to be in-person. Due to the lack of transparency on state data, the most accurate Covid numbers are found in the state's sewage  -- and the numbers are terrifying. Figures from Aug. 18  showed a higher concentration of Covid-19 in Des Moines' sewage than 85 percent of other cities nationwide. (The concentration had doubled just since Aug. 4.)

Reynolds is as cold-hearted and calculating as DeSantis and Abbott, but seems to be flying under the radar. I guess Iowa has to wait until hospitals start adding refrigerated morgues to their parking lot. That seems to be the optic that sparks national attention."

DeSantis has direct control over how many people he allows to die in his state. It doesn't even need a mandate. Tell people the truth: the vaccine can help you live. If you've had the vaccine and you get COVID the odds are with you that you live, you may get sick, but most likely you will live.

Ignorance is the bread and butter of conservative politics.

I saw that somewhere and I printed it out so that I can look at it every day.

Republicans and Conservatives demand blind allegiance to their ideology.  And in some cases it is a pretty good stretch to get from insanity to an idea, but if that's the cause, they're with it. Lock, stock and barrel.

Many times the mental gymnastics is obvious; like DeSantis and the Republicans of Florida.  God forbid a different point of view crosses their bow.  DeSantis clearly wants to become president, God help anything in his way.

An he's clearly willing to sacrifice his most ardent supporters to death, so that he may come victorious to claim the crown. Even if we, the USA, don't believe in or have a crown.

Remember; Ignorance is the bread and butter of conservative politics.

Florida's case rate is three times that of California;
Florida's hospitalization rate is four times that of CA; and,
Florida's death rate is five and one-half times that of CA.

Those who follow right-wing Republicans are headed for disease and death. It's OK for them to make that choice for themselves; it's not OK to allow them to spray their potentially virus-infected breath in the faces of others, particularly unvaccinated young children."

How has Biden ""swerved left"" on Covid responses? I missed it. Once we allow Biden to be defined as ""left"" on Covid, we have moved the debate farther to the right.

This is no different , in effect, than closing your eyes and firing a gun randomly.  You most likely won't inflict any substantial damage, but there is a modest probability of injury or death.  However, you would likely be arrested for the later and are guaranteed not to pay a criminal penalty for the former.  The former, in Florida, Texas and many other Republican states is encouraged."
2021-08-30 00:40:43,"Totally correct to call this guy out, Mr. Blow, and well you did.

We are where we are because of Trump. He gutted our pandemic defense agency as soon as he took office cause he just felt in his bones it had to go.

Then he almost dies of the virus after he called it a trifle. Afterwards he continued to pooh pooh the killer and got all macho over the mask issue he created saying it was un-American to put one on. His mouth needed to be seen as he opened it to effluence. He looks at himself still; 2024?

DeSantis has a funny name cause it stems from a concept of holy or sacred aspect imbued in a human being whereas Ron comes off like a cold blooded Kool Aid waiter offering all the peninsula residents a paper cup of CoVid.

Even so, England still browses toward herd immunity, incoherent wild freedom for the masses to infect one another while the oldsters and sensible hole up and stay low.

The tragedy is that our mutual responsibility to care for others of our community is lost in the political posturing of taking a stance one way over the other to accept scientific experts advice or distrust it.

A world view founded in conspiracy is one engendered by the middle ages' view of a Devil subverting us secretly when today the media takes care of all that publicly without calling it entertainment so that the populace swallows it whole.

Surely DeSantis has followers who will soon expire naturally from other causes offered by the freedom to die and not not kill others doing so."
2021-08-30 00:40:53,"DeSantis is attempting to emulate and maybe even replace Trump. It won't work for several reasons. But specifically, regarding the pandemic Trump had an advantage. For a while at least he could preach that Covid was a hoax. He has many believers. A week or so ago at a rally he begged is followers to get vaccinated. He got booed.

Yet as the pandemic progresses, again bodies are going to start piling up in refrigerated trucks in hospital parking lots. Everyone will know someone who died, suffered through weeks in the hospital, and/or is dealing with long covid. Emergency rooms and icu's won't be available for anyone but  Covid patients

At some point these realities as well as the Fox induced popularity of hydrochloroquine or poison level doses of ivermectin are going to start registering.

Seat belts were anathema for years until they started to make sense and rallying against them became a fools errand. The same thing will happen with Covid, and DeSantis will go down with the cultist rants."

Freedom is working as a responsible member of a society. Freedom is not the ""right"" to yell ""fire"" in a crowded movie theater. That is license. Freedom is civic responsibility, the right to live within a society as a member of the society and to contribute to the whole for the desire for all citizens to live constructive and productive lives. However, ambitious politicians like DeSantis interpret civic responsibility as some form of communism. Anything for the public good is considered suspect and nefarious, and that's his - sorry to use this word - his trump card. Or Trump card. He takes the lack of knowledge and compassion among his supporters, and twists it into his own world view. Sadly, he is not alone, and the Trump World - the world of the unknowingly misled and gullible, have bought his nonsense - hook, line, and sinker.

It is not necessarily just a matter of DeSantis ""allowing"" people to choose death, by using his office to try to make masking in schools illegal, he is ""promoting"" death.

It's bad enough he's trying to out-Trump Donald Trump with his populist spoutings and anti-scientific views -- and by all evidence is succeeding, but to take square aim at the health of those who are too young to be vaccinated, and therefore at the greatest risk is just plain diabolical.
Of course, the right-wing punditry on Fox and social media platforms aren't helping.

The incidence of ""breakthrough infections"" - which are those in which a fully vaccinated person gets infected thereby allowing that individual to become a vector to infect others - is less than 1%.

Which means that, you guessed it, over 99% of all Covid-19  patients out there right now were infected by someone who wasn't vaccinated.

And you know what that means?

It means that of the 247 deaths from Covid-19 in Florida today, at least 245 of them were caused as a direct result of people exercising what Mr. DeSantis refers to as their ""personal freedom""."

The same fear and fury that was directed outward at Muslims after 9-11 has now been turned against the enemies who threaten MAGA America at home. Republicans are so convinced that we are dead set on taking their ""freedom"" that masks and vaccines can't NOT be politicized as battles. What Tucker Carlson says very plainly––they are ""coming for you""––is the deep conviction of millions.

How are people who deny facts to live in chaos ""owning"" people who use evidence to progress to better outcomes? In other words, the popular rhetoric suggests a goal for Republicans that is not only perverse but also unattainable.

The pandemic has laid bare that a certain type of Republican governor (talking to you, DeSantis, Abbott and Ducey) will sacrifice his own constituents on the cynical (and, in a perfect world, also nonsensical) calculation that it will benefit him politically. Better to promote a ludicrous interpretation of freedom, and to maintain power over a state full of corpses, than to expend effort reducing caseloads and accomplish something for the collective good (ya know, their actual job). 

If their damage could be contained within their own state borders, and limited to the people to vote them into power, then we might turn a blind eye. But sick people infect other people who infect more people -- many while traveling -- and the damage is anything but contained.

Overall Florida's vaccination rate exceeds the national average, is the highest in the south, and its vaccination rate for those over age 65 exceeds most states, including California.  DeSantis was the first governor to open free statewide sites to receive MABs, a proven treatment to prevent most Covid hospitalizations; when the winter Covid surges come to the northern states, governors there would do well to copy this strategy.

It was astounding, that the measures to re-open Broadway outpaced the plans for re-opening schools !! 
The CDC now ONLY recommends safety practices. No other mitigation strategies are enforced or mandated. We are all on our own.

As cruel as it sounds, the boomer generation has never been empathetic. In their majority, it's probably the most selfish generation. 

Countering and overcoming pandemic requires a community, group action and good will. Something that Boomer's parents did with polio and other infectious diseases. But something that Boomers seem to be entirely blind to. 

This has been the entire basis of the mask debate. Covid virus is very small and can get through any cloth mask. Which causes Facebook  virologists to claim they are not effective. The real world is this - most of virus loads are ejected in droplets of spit. For example when fake freedom fighters ‘splain to you in the store that masks don’t work. For people who wear a mask to guard against infection protection is limited - maybe 20% improvement and is entirely dependent on how long you stand in front of the fake freedom fighter and listen to him. 

But if the person who is infected wears the mask to prevent the spit from flying, cloth masks are very effective in stopping the spread - 80%. But that would require the freedom fighter to care about anyone else’s wellbeing. That problem is the real hole in mask mandates. People who are most likely to ignore it are the very ones who are likely to spread it and kill others."

The results have been as consequential, to our America as the withdrawal from Afghanistan, resulting in many hundreds of thousands losing their faith in our democracy and their very lives, dying needlessly.  Republicans, no longer represent law and order, fiscal responsibility or family values nor Christian principles.  Quite the opposite, the last five years have shown their utter contempt for, not only our laws but God’s laws, along with chaos, confusion over a pandemic, and increased irresponsible spending on their own lobbyists and corporate donors gaining welfare (tax cuts) they didn’t need while the rest of us suffer and die by the hundreds of thousands.

The current reality, it goes without saying,   strongly suggests this policy does not really seem to have worked out.

So to all those continuing to support a policy as failed as
was the country's policy in Afghanistan, what is your plan B, given that your plan A is evidently a big failure?

It is that question/challenge that needs to be posed not only
to this overly ambitious politician but to all those in the 
state who continue to support him.

Unfortunately, I suspect the answer is not what we would like to hear...there is little evidence that in zones that voted for him there is much dissipation of his support. 

In addition, the state democratic party, like that in TX, appears to be completely flummoxed and incapable of getting in their governor's face with a concrete alternative to 
the failed policy. 

This is a cultural and social failing, certainly exploited by the two governors, but one for which they are not really 
causally responsible. They just know how to use it for 
their political advantage.

On climate change- unable to fathom the science, they fear anything that might cause them to sacrifice for the collective whole. On the pandemic- the espouse ""personal freedom,"" even when they and their families die around them- the ultimate form of denial. 

To alleviate their fears, many true to drugs and other forms of addictions. 

The don't want answers- they want to hear that they are great, their nation is great and the rest of the world is nothing. They feed off of lies- like a drug. And when they can they prey upon those even weaker- immigrants, the disabled, foreigners, etc. 

MAGMA? No rather MAPA- Make American pitiful again."

It is easy to identify these parties as the heirs of the various fascist or similar parties of the pre/post war Europe, like Italy, Hungary, Germany. In the mouth of these people the word Freedom is empty like the shell of a dead mussel, and yet they keep using it. Why? I have no answer but my feeling is that hey use it as a brain washing slogan, a unifying flag and call to arm for all those people that have no idea of what history is and has done. A slogan that follows decades of anticommunist propaganda in the name of ""freedom"" and for that has a easy grasp on the weak minds of too many."

We are no longer in the ""professionalism"" referred to in Remains of the Day (Thank you Chris Reeves; thank you Tony Hopkins).  No.  Now we are in the wackadoodle whiteness of Oath Keepers, 3%ers, and Proud Boys, who have wiggled their way into my consciousness."

It gives the willfully ignorant and the sociopaths among us the ability to deny what is happening. Even to deny it when it is happening to them. As far as concern for children goes, that concern will also fall on deaf ears. Example is the killings at Sandy Hook. If something as horrific as that did not stir the soul of this society to collective action, the quiet death of a child in ICU drowning in fluid filled lungs will not.
America is on a path of decline."

 DeSantis's disastrous decisions during this pandemic have caused the unnecessary deaths of thousands of Floridians. For the good of Florida and the country, he needs to do the right thing and step down and let a capable person govern Florida."
2021-08-30 01:31:41,"Governor DeSantis may be a self correcting problem if he maintains his policy positions. Every three days and change, the number of Floridian Covid deaths equal the vote difference between Bush and Gore in 2000 before the Supreme Court 5 stopped the recount. Florida’s Covid death rate shows little sign of slowing and the largest number of virus fodder are his base, unvaccinated white evangelicals."
2021-08-30 04:09:07,"In any moment during the 20th century, what DeSantis and his followers are doing to the citizens of Florida would have been equated with reckless abandonment of public safety. The difference between then and now is that their recklessness—really a form of soft genocide—now falls under the canopy of “personal freedom.” Heartbreaking and infuriating."

2021-08-29 22:51:15,"Americans don't always have long memories.  DeSantis is counting on that in his lead up to the 2024 presidential election. He's assuming that Covid will have settled down by then and people will have moved on. He will then crow about how he fought for people's freedom to make their own choices about their health (and their kids' health). Of course, DeSantis also has to hope that DJT is out of the picture knowing that DJT would throw him under the very big bus in a heartbeat.  
Don't Republicans ever ask themselves, is the best their party can put forth?"

And I can ask the same of those DeSantis lackeys. Sadly there will be no response. That is because there is nothing admirable about Trump or mini-Trump. Ron DeSantis as President?

The people not getting vaccinated are not refusing because Trump or DeSantis told them not to get vaccinated.
They decided on their own not to get vaccinated.
DeSantis and now Trump know that the vaccine deniers are their base and if they want to be reelected they better not push vaccines and say nothing about how safe and effective the vaccines are.
Fox News and OAN have not convinced people not to get vaccinated. They just reaffirm what the vaccine deniers have already decided.
Trump did not make his loyal base racist, xenophobic and misogynist.
They already were; he just told he was one of them and they love him for that."

Drunk drivers are subject to criminal punishment as well as civil liability payments if found guilty.  

Not wearing masks in indoor, high population density venues has a high likelihood of causing other citizens to be infected with Covid-19, even if the non-masked has no symptoms of Covid-19.  The unmasked should be liable for criminal and civil sanctions.

A civil servant that outlaws masks is no different than the bartender that continues to serve an obviously drunk patron.  That civil servant is responsible for causing illness in their citizens and should be responsible for criminal and civil sanctions.

The Lakota stood up to Noem, and the cities and school districts of Texas and Florida are standing up to Abbott and DeSantis.

Biden failed totally everywhere, so, these pundits need a bogeyman to kick. But these will boomerang. In 8 months of Biden, America has almost same number of coronavirus infection that Trump had in a year and more than 200K deaths.

2021-08-29 23:54:58,"@Rabble I think the elephant in the room is IQ. Some people are smarter than others and some are not smart at all, and in fact, some are below average IQ. Average, I believe is 80. There are many many people who simply don't have the brain-power let alone education to put 2 and 2 together. They really don't see the connection between their refusal to mask and vaccinate and their own death, and their endangering the lives of innocent helpless others who do not threaten them. I believe it is appropriate to acknowledge the intelligence gap that separates the maskless, anti-vaxxers from the rest of the population. This is one reason that they must be made to feel economic pain -- pay more for insurance or lose it altogether, be refused at hospitals if unvaccinated by choice, be segregated in health care settings to wings where only anti-vax health care workers work, and where aspirin is the only remedy offered. After all, it is no more than just like a flu. I want to see economic sanctions against the ignoramuses who are incapable of learning."
2021-08-29 22:44:02,"As Mr. Blow points out, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis is ""allowing you to choose death"" so that he can court Trump's base and run for President; however it is much worse than that:

1) His comment  “We can either have a free society, or we can have a biomedical security state.” -- is rediculous. Currently, schoolchildren in Florida are required to have the following vaccinations before they attend class:  

Diphtheria-tetanus-acellular Pertussis (DTAP), Inactivated Polio Vaccine (IPV), Measles-mumps-rubella (MMR), Varicella (chickenpox), Haemophilus Influenzae Type B (HIB), Pneumococcal Conjugate (PCV13) and Hepatitis B (HEP B).

Mr. DeSantis has not cuased a ruccus about these vaccines, and the idea that Covid 19 vaccines are somehow different from these is pure absurdity; and:

2) Through his actions to ban mask and vaccine mandates for most everyone including schools and private companies -- including, for God's sake, cruise ship companies -- is the moral equivalent of manslaughter. 

It has been proven, beyond a reasonable doubt that there have been instances where unvaccinated teachers with Covid have spread the Delta Variant to schoolchildren and other school staff in super-spreader events.

Worse (if that is possible), DeSantis' main point is fatally flawed: a person choosing to be unvaccinated and unmasked is choosing to imperil not just themselves, but all the vulnerable people they know, including their parents and grandparents, children and the Immunocompromised."
2021-08-29 23:47:45,"Governor DeSantis, you spend an awful lot of airtime shouting about what you're not going to do to stem the COVID crisis in Florida. We get it: no mask mandates, no vaccine mandates. No need to keep shouting that mantra at the microphone. But what you haven't done is spend much time talking about just what it is you are doing to actually alleviate the crisis. Well Ron, any better ideas? Any ideas at all?  If you can come up with better ideas than masks and vaccines, we are all ears. Or is your strategy to just let the virus run rampant in your state, taking lives and overwhelming ICU units and morgue trailers while you cry ""personal freedom."" Just so you know, that's not an example of good leadership in a crisis. And yes, Florida is in an escalating crisis."

2021-08-29 22:10:07,"I can't think of another instance in which the fallout from a massive pile of Republican lies has been so narrowly heaped upon themselves, as opposed to everyone else.

I think it's important for me to point out that, as opposed to many others out there, I don't feel as if the unvaccinated are my enemies. But, their collective ignorance is. In fact, it's an enemy of all of ours because it threatens our very survival.

But, while I have some compassion for these unfortunate souls who are filling up hospital beds all over the place, I have none what-so-ever for those who know better - people like Trump, DeSantis, and Carlson for example - who are willing to use these poor saps ignorance as a way of enriching themselves politically and/or financially.

And this would include practically every Republican who defends being unvaccinated as a ""personal choice"" yet who are all fully vaccinated themselves.

It's almost as if people like DeSantis are saying, ""If you don't want to get vaccinated, I'll support that!"", but at the same time are thinking to themselves, ""I just hope your incalculable idiocy doesn't cause you to die a painful and easily preventable death before you get a change to vote for me again!"".

It shows that their concern for re-election is more important to them than the very lives of those they are supposed to represent - and look out for.

The word ""craven"" comes to mind. And a lot of other words which would never get past the moderators of a family newspaper."

Few articles address why there is a surge here. It is indoor season, lots of out of state tourists, a lot of knuckleheads who refuse to be vaccinated and diminished natural immunity because of relatively low rates of infections previously. The death rate in Florida is two thirds of new York's. It was always Trump's fault before the election. Now they have targeted DeSantis, hoping to stick him with the responsibility. The NYT finally ran an article about how plexiglass shields were ineffective in preventing transmission and could make things worse by reducing ventilation. That was not news to many of us. The mask wars are raging here. Maybe the NYT will be as honest about the effectiveness of paper and cloth masks like they were with plexiglass shields, Someday. I think most people think paper and cloth masks protect the wearer. It is forbidden to question how well masks work. Those of us who follow the scientists and not ""the science"" probably have a different point of view on the effectiveness of masks. But politics comes before truth. DeSantis is a huge threat to the Democrats, so he must be trashed."

Really? Those are our only two choices, huh?

Why is it that Republicans feel that anything they say should be accepted as the truth, no matter how absurd? This is a pure straw argument and a false dichotomy. And, it goes without saying that Mr. DeSantis knew full well that when he said it, he was lying through his teeth.

It's logically equivalent to him saying, ""If you get rid of me, everyone will die!"", because nothing could be further from the truth.

DeSantis is a master of the mixed message. It's true that his administration did the work to get old folks vaccinated. But at the same time, he has fervently supported keeping businesses open and living mask-free in a virulent world -- as if people under 65 don't spread the disease, get sick, get hospitalized and sometimes die of this virus. His mixed messages are costing individuals their lives and the public and private sectors a freaking fortune in medical care. As if the virus isn't scary enough, it's also very EXPENSIVE to get it."

Absolutely.  At Trump's last rally, he tried to tell his followers to get vaccinated.  He was loudly booed.  Trump has created something even he cannot control.  The mob truly is the master.  Vaccines are tyranny!

Desantis understands this and is 100% playing to the mob.  He cares nothing of the sick and dying.  He cares nothing of those who will get sick and die.

He even cares nothing about saving the taxpayers money.  Instead of giving everyone a $10 shot, he is in favor of injecting all the sick people with monoclonal antibodies which cost over $3000 plus a couple of nights in the hospital.  To him, that's freedom.  To him, that's being a conservative out to protect the taxpayer.

2021-08-29 23:45:23,"Based on the attention from the NY Times Democrat cheerleaders, we know that DeSantis is the frontrunner for 2024. Some thoughts for consideration:

1. Why do Hawaii and Oregon have surges despite Democratic governors with mask mandates.
2. Why did states that had widespread mask wearing still suffer tremendously in the third wave, like California.
3. Why won't media recognize that the cumulative effect of the pandemic, from start through current, is important because it reflects both vaccines and natural immunity -- the latter is directly related to the difficulty of prior waves, such as in states like NY, NJ and RI.
4. Are mask mandates really a proxy for regulations that can't be implemented, like reducing high velocity transmission in bars, nightclubs and house parties. Why won't politicians say so if it's true. Oregon went so far as to issue an unnecessary outdoor mask requirement. 

Politically, DeSantis probably doesn't need all of the mask headaches -- just let local politicians do what they want in their schools.

There is no objective study indicating there was anything that DeSantis could have done differently, other than promote more vaccines, which are by far the best solution. Even the NY Times didn't suggest there were measures that could have halted the spread in Florida without significantly curtailing economic activity, including tourism (see ""<a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/28/us/florida-coronavirus-covid-19-vaccines-variant.html"" target=""_blank"">https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/28/us/florida-coronavirus-covid-19-vaccines-variant.html</a>"")."

Florida is up there with Mississippi and Louisiana in current death rate per 100,000 people and 5,300 people have died of covid in the last month. DeSantis blames this on 'seasonality.'

The Washington Post was only news organization mentioning a possible investigation into the failure in oversight at the SNS.
Then when the HHS IG started to investigate the matter Trump had her removed by Michael Caputo. Remember Caputo's reaction to the breaking news of her removal?? He had what seemed like a mental breakdown and disappeared.
Va. Senator Mark Warner had mentioned a possible investigation into the CDC/SNS failure but nothing happened. The Times should investigate the issue and expose the politics behind the malfeasance at the HHS. Check the CDC's 2009 H1N1 summary report and you can see the operational protocols in place at that time with the CDC/SNS.

If people want to kill themselves so be it.  Now, here is what does bother me (although not you, I’m sure).  Hundreds of thousands of unvaccinated illegal immigrants are streaming across the border and Biden won’t even condescend to turn back the criminals or repeat offenders who are spreading COVID like wildfire.  This ignorance is like the woke academic waves sweeping the country.  Oregon no longer requires evidence of any type of proficiency in reading, writing, or mathematics for high school graduation, because it is unfair to expect SOC to know anything.

We're witnessing the same thing as we speak. Even though Trump launched ""Operation Warp Speed"" to get vaccines into development and production during his administration, because the vaccines shipped after he was out of office, his followers don't want to take the vaccine. They'll kill themselves to make a Democrat look bad. Even their favorite news outlet is making piles of money by spreading lies about a lifesaving miracle. Because they, too, have to oppose anything good that a Democrat might do. 

Even Trump won't acknowledge publicly that he was vaccinated. He'll benefit from it, but won't do anything to help the millions of people who voted for him avoid infection.

They somehow believe that the Oligarchs will save space on a dying planet for enclaves of the hyper-wealthy. Should Planet Earth fail completely, then Mars and the Moon will step in on the backs of the Three Amigos, Musk, Bezos and Branson. 

Racist to the core, the Republican Party also fantasizes a ""base"" mesmerized by a white Jesus, and Evangelical Hordes, obsessed with a Rapture acceptable in any form of man-made apocalypse. 

We are stuck in the mire of this insanity. Fueled by the Oligarchs, right wing media has created a black hole of sorts, sucking the ignorant far right masses into the muck.

Yet it must be acknowledged that, again bucking his critics, he got most of the big calls right.

He did a better job of protecting care-homes than several of his media-beloved Democratic counterparts, including Andrew Cuomo of New York. He was dead right on schools.

2021-08-30 00:17:00,"I still don't understand the GOP's desire to kill off their own constituents. Most of the people who are dying of Covid are the unvaccinated, and most of the unvaccinated are die-hard Trump/DeSantis Republicans. Dead people can't vote for Republicans or Democrats, so why kill off your own voters?

Otherwise, there are only one of two ways that Trump or DeSantis can win the 2024 election. One is if Trump, DeSantis, and enough die-hard Republican survive the pandemic, and that doesn't look likely, given the current numbers. Even those of us who survived the virus have after-effects, like brain fog. Not to give ammunition to the GOP, but what will happen if their constituents get brain fog and vote for a Democrat? Seems to me that the GOP wouldn't want that to happen, and so should be advocating getting the vaccine.

The other way for the GOP/Trump/DeSantis to win is if they just come right out in the open and close the election to all Democrat voters and all Democrats running for office. Which, in a round-about way, they seem to be trying to do in case killing off their own voters doesn't do the trick."
2021-08-30 00:43:08,"The covidpalooza is even more beneficial to DeSantis than you suggest. It's more than simply taking the anti-fact, own-the-libs-by-killing-the-citizenry reins. As has been documented extensively, ancient religions and cults practiced human sacrifice because it strengthened the commitment of those who didn't die to the cause and the group. Present-day terrorist leaders who employ suicide bombers know this very well. Republican citizens see the refrigerated morgue trucks and understand the life-and-death stakes. Far from deterred, they see themselves as risking their lives for the cause of freedom, urged by the GOP leadership and media shills to willfully ignore the unimportance of the particular freedom (from masks and vaccines) involved so as not to diminish their sense of heroism. That explains the fervor and rage expressed at school board meetings and elsewhere over such trivialities. GOP leaders, in many respects terrorist leaders themselves, fully understand the benefits they accrue with every death of someone else's kin."
2021-08-30 01:06:57,"This anti-science business confuses me.  Does DeSantis know what is in the Tylenol he may take, the vaccines his children were given, the hot dogs he grilled on the 4th of July, his polio or mumps or rubella vaccines he received as a child, his deodorant, his cell phone, or the food he just ate at a restaurant?  Has he questioned the food his family is having for dinner tonight?  Probably not.  But masks?  Now there's an issue he can lie about to his constituents.  Republicans seem numb to death as their fellow Americans struggle to breathe hooked up to a ventilator.

Masks for students and staff?  How easy is that!!!"
2021-08-30 03:29:52,"Once the kids can all get vaccinated, the Florida laissez faire approach will be the only one left to pursue. Unless vaccinations are mandated, we aren’t going to move the needle any more than we already have with the unvaccinated. And the rest of us won’t accept more/stronger/continuous public health measures. Once the under 12 are vaccinated, we are going to have to ditch the masking and the distancing and accept that COVID is here to stay and not worth any additional sacrifices. If you plan on trolling this, have the courage to do it under your own name."
2021-08-29 22:55:48,"""... very few facts helped Trump...""

True. But one fact was extremely helpful to Trump: Democrats promoting racism through the BLM movement is hateful and divisive and a powerful favor in motivating Trumpies who, after all, are human and really don't like being the target of racist attacks.

The result is probably hundreds of thousands of extra American dead of Covid from Republican mis-leadership. In Florida, as you point out, they're still dying from Republican politics.

to move past the murderous Trumpist phase of US history, we need to call a hate group a hate group, whether it's Proud Boys or Black Lives Matter."
2021-08-30 02:40:19,"The Trump freedom fighters didn’t want the right to get sick and die.  They wanted the right to indiscriminately kill anyone near them without detection, and without penalty.  Many of us who initially cared about everyone, no longer understand this suicide by virus cabal.  The issues are that they kill innocent people, fill hospitals, drive health care workers over the edge.  By crowding hospitals, they force delayed care and surgeries for many people who ultimately will also be maimed or die because of lack of available hospital beds.

What these souls misguided by RdS don’t get is that they are common killers."
2021-08-30 03:28:48,"Just stop making this about politics.
We can not like DeSantis's politics without calling him a murderer. Especially sitting in New York... deaths per million
NY: 2,814
FL: 2,048/M
Let's look at vaccine rates. Florida is above the national average in fully vaccinated and has done extremely well with the vulnerable over 65 age group.
Then look at incremental deaths. Florida is near the national average. Note: NY is much higher. So is California.
We need to stop playing politics with this pandemic. Stop thinking we know the answers. 
Note: Look at Sweden. No lockdowns. Schools & business open. No masking. Number 39 in the world in deaths per million behind most of the EU and U.S.
Incremental deaths in Sweden are very low. 
There might be a better strategy than population-wide lockdowns. You think?
Under the current strategy, there is no end in sight. Perhaps call Anders Tegnell?"
2021-08-29 23:44:19,The press is ripping Biden apart  like a pack of hyenas over a war we lost. Covid is a war we could win. The press could hold these negligent leaders accountable more as you are doing Mr Blow. If every eligible person was vaccinated/wore masks we could save perhaps 1000 deaths a day on our own soil. USA average right now is about 1250 deaths per day. Florida and Texas lost 439 lives just today. It's very sad that R leaders care much more about 12 heroic deaths (they died trying to free others) that perhaps make Biden look bad than the 1000s of deaths they themselves are responsible for (that are meaningless and preventable).
2021-08-29 23:57:26,"My comment is going to be very personal and some what ethnic.  I am the grandson of immigrant Sicilian & Neapolitan grandparents.  As a boy my father was quite poor.  His mother worked in a textile factory.  He picked tobacco leaves as a child in tobacco fields during the Depression.  He rode the rails and traveled to the Midwest when he was 12, living in ""hobo camps"" (his words).  He sent me to Catholic schools, I went to University, and I became a white collar professional.  But I was imbued with the struggles that my immigrant family went through to ""make it"" here.  It's in my bones & my psyche. 

That's why I can't understand De Santis, Giuliani, Cuccinelli, Pompeo, Manafort(e), DeJoy (also ethnically Italian).  They seem to have no compassion or real love for the new immigrants, for working people, for the poor.  All they seem to care about is money and power, which seems to be why they all love Trump.   I view them as a bunch of goons who wear suits and ties but it would have been black shirts back in Italy when Mussolini was in charge.  I don't understand how they have forgotten how they got here.  

I don't mean to paint all Italian-Americans with that brush. Nancy Pelosi has a heart a mile wide and deep.  She is such wonderful human being.  She's my ideal of what a caring politician, of Italian descent or not, should be like.   

But DeSantis conduct is killing people.  It is tragic what he's doing, and being a Harvard graduate, he should know better."
2021-08-30 00:32:47,"To answer your question, no number of deaths will suffice until Ron DeSantis is recognized by republicans as the heir to Trump, and recognized by Trump as his worthy successor.  In the mean time, people will continue to perish.  To usher in a white christian theocracy, the likes of DeSantis will sacrifice the last American.  

I am a bit worried, Mr. Blow, about the likes of me (I don't know how many people I might represent, maybe not that many).  We could never vote for republicans - who by now are clearly in deadly pursuit of a white christian nation at all costs - even if it involves destroying the environment, gutting justice and education, and killing their flock with vaccine-and-mask paranoia.  We are completely disgusted by the crazies on the left based on their positions ('de-fund police', 'I am offended so you are wrong and you should be cancelled' and other jokers without perspective) and actions (see humanities and lib arts programs in the bottom 50% of American colleges).  We are absolutely flabbergasted by the ineptitude and refusal to stay on message, the absence of strategy among democrats.

No coverage, no opinion pieces.  I know these stories are clickbait but just stop."
2021-08-30 03:36:36,"There are two Floridas, and they're almost evenly divided. The scant half that elected DeSantis (by only 10,000 votes) may want the freedom to died a horrible death. But the other half gets vaccinated, wears masks in public places (grocery stores and the like) and avoids indoor dining. They don't avoid the Delta variant entirely, but if they contract it, they usually have very mild symptoms and stay home for ten days.

The most heart-wrenching victims of DeSantis's folly are children under the age of 12. They can't get the vaccine, and  so they're at the mercy of misguided politics. Many of them contract milder cases, but some die needlessly, and they aren't ""free"" in the way that adults are.

DeSantis's folly also injures the state's economy, discouraging tourists.

What could DeSantis be thinking? That's the problem: he doesn't think. He just caters to his ""base."" The irony entailed in that word should escape nobody."
