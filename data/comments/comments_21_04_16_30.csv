2021-04-29 14:44,"The media, opposition parties, and host of interests arrayed against the Modi administration railed against the lockdowns last year.  While it caused much economic pain, it did manage to contain the pandemic.  Especially, given India’s poor health infrastructure, that was perhaps the best option.  Beginning of this year, both the politicians and the people dropped their guard and now face unprecedented misery.  It is useful lesson to keep in mind even as the anti-Modi brigade has begun using this tragedy to achieve their political and cultural goals to neutralize Modi and the rising acknowledgment that India is a Vedic civilization, just as I am constantly reminded here that America is a so called Judeo-Christian one."
2021-04-29 14:52,"We must IMMEDIATELY ban all incoming flights from India until we know what this is.  

This may be a brand new pandemic and risks setting our country back to zero.

I hope Biden understands the gravity of this.  We MUST ban all travel from India from all avenues."
2021-04-29 14:54,India is keeping case and death count lower than it is for political reasons. The stories are horribly sad although the US has reported much higher numbers all along and no one had much to say. I think India’s 200k is similar to China’s numbers...simply false.
2021-04-29 16:55,"In a family if one member is tested positive, the rest of the members are presumed to be positive and not tested. And so that leads to a low number, even though the 350,000 is still a very high number. This is only the beginning and I am very sad to see this."
2021-04-29 17:16,"Despite the tragedy of poverty in India, there are numerous super rich people and corporations not paying their fair share of taxes, partly perhaps because the tax structure favors them. That needs to be changed, so that the demands of infrastructure and emergencies such as Covid can be dealt with more effectively. There is also a level of corruption that contributes to the problem. America and other countries should help, but countries have to reform their structures so that they can help themselves."
2021-04-29 16:09,"Don’t think most folks appreciate the danger this poses to our hard won, tenuous COVID progress. 

Everybody’s. Everywhere.

Hope they can get a handle on it. Likely to take years."
2021-04-29 16:13,"Unless the recalcitrant section of our population gets on board and takes the vaccine by summer, we could be looking at another variant surge. The media could do a lot to encourage people, which would be a welcome change from their overwrought coverage of the extremely rare side effects of the vaccines.

Perhaps reminding everyone of how smallpox was eradicated by a vaccine that had a fatality rate of one in a million - more than the J&J covid vaccine the news media turned into a disaster."
2021-04-29 17:16,Blame the variant but ultimately it’s the human population and it’s leadership at fault for consistently ignoring medical advice.
2021-04-29 18:05,"Not only the new variant there exist many ground for exponentially increasing number of cases in India like Mass gathering  during election, Religious Kumb fair, Cricket match ; low vaccination drive, shortage of logistics, human resources and infrastructure, lack of directional operational plan and last but not the least Corruption."
2021-04-29 18:38,"Time for health authorities to show that they can put poilics aside and can collaborate internationally. 

A complete, quick and public assessment of the current health crisis that is free of politics and speculation goes a long way in increasing public's confidence on the scientific progress we made in the last year. Let's work on a scenario that crisis in India today doesn't become a spreading crisis. Who knows. That increased public confidence that we have our act together this time, may even help with increased vaccinations here in US."
2021-04-29 14:49,Biden’s incompetence is resulting in millions of deaths in India and Pakistan. . The fault runs directly to his desk. Shameful India and Pakistan were not supplied with the vaccine in adequate numbers.
2021-04-29 15:52,"India is a nuclear power. It san launch satellites into space, has numerous jet fighters and ships in its military arsenal, yet it can't take care of its most important asset, its citizens.

Maybe, just maybe, idiot politicians will get off their high horse, god knows, maybe their high elephant, stop wasting tax revenues on all types of weapons systmes and make certain that every community has potable water, establish sanitation standards, make certain that their citizens have food and lodging, etc. 

This goes for all countries in the world but especially in relation to India as it has an educated middle class. Although with a stratified class structure that may be part of the problem."
2021-04-29 16:29,"> India Blames a Virus Variant

There is saying in Sanskrit which can be translated as ""as is the ruler, so are the people"". Lot of Indians living abroad are are mad at nytimes, wapo,  bbc for publishing pictures of  people suffering, cremations etc.,  criticizing as death-porn. It is sad that these folks can't escape from false pride even in the middle of a disaster. 

nytimes, wapo etc., did publish numerous pictures of refrigerated trucks full of bodies, burial grounds, senior care centers, people waiting in parking lots in despair in places like NYC, CA, Madrid, Italy, Brazil"
2021-04-29 17:52,"The elephant in the room is that _if_ this enormous upsurge in India is because of a new more deadly mutation, then it is a critical and serious blow to containing Covid.  More data is needed but it is very worrisome."
2021-04-29 18:35,"It is good that much of the world is trying to help India in this catastrophe. India was able to deal with the first wave well and then dropped its guard. This is like taking a win for granted before the last inning is over. Nevertheless, India's help to the other countries earlier is being reciprocated now. See-

2021-04-29 21:40,Showing the visuals of the deceased is in a poor taste and disrespectful of them. Sensationalization of poor peoples suffering can hardly be called good journalism.
2021-04-29 22:18,"Honestly, who cares which variant is raging across which region of this country? Neither one of the vaccine options whether JnJ, Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna, or Astra Zenica indicate they can effectively diminish this God-forsaken virus. Modi shows he has more personal self-interest than the interest in the health of his fellow countrymen when he opens the country and loosens restrictions after the 1st wave blew over. The virus may eventually be overcome through herd immunity due to an entire country of infected citizens, but in the process hundreds of thousands of souls will perish not least because of Modi's self-important and self-righteous political life."
2021-04-29 20:43,"India’s “leaders” have downplayed coronavirus just like Twice Impeached did here. The differences? We have scientists who are not completely muzzled, a reasonably educated, level-headed populace outside the Republican Party and India has densely populated cities within a country of 1 billion people."
2021-04-29 20:50,This is a real catastrophe.  US as world leader should consider this nothing less than world emergency and use everything at its disposal including Military to help Inda combat the spread of virus.

2021-04-30 0:53,Prime minister Modi consults his astrologer before deciding COVID health policy. Here are the results.
2021-04-30 2:19,"‘India’ blames ? NO ! Only the Ruling Party apologists blame an unheard of ‘variant’ for the Modi-created horrific Covid-19 national calamity. Just as Trump falsely blamed WHO for creating the US’s own Covid-19 disaster. Right from Modi’s 1million-strong Namaste Trump extravaganza in late-Feb 2020 to curry favour with Trump (when Trump had already banned flights to US to protect from Covid-19) to a cruel nationwide Total Lockdown with 4 hrs notice triggering tens of millions to crowd into bus stations in panic to mammoth election rallies by the Ruling Party without masks to donation of 65 million vaccine doses to Asian & African nations to nurture his global brand, Narendra Modi has taken every possible step to create the present Pandemic Disaster in India. Even now, when every nation is providing Free Covid-19 vaccines to its people & Indian Govts had provided Free vaccines to all Indians right from 1947 - for last 73 years - Modi has demanded Indians pay Rs.600 for each vaccine shot (even though India is the world’s largest producer of vaccines), sinking the national vaccination campaign right at the start."
2021-04-30 2:48,"The longer this virus has available hosts the greater the chances are of it mutating a strain that is, in effect, a new virus -- one against which current vaccines will be ineffective. Our best chance to thwart Nature's math is worldwide vaccinations, meaning putting politics aside. Feeling hopeful? I'm not tossing my mask any time soon."
2021-04-30 2:56,"@Mr Gettleman, I couldn't post under your other article. Please get yourself and your family back to the States and take your mRNA vaccines and let your NYT salary for the next 3 months come to senior Indian journalists writing from the ground here, for NYT. This is not an attack on you. But your govt has called you back, and the money NYT can pay will make a tiny, helpful dent in this slide of poverty you've just written of. Thanks. Hope you stay safe and your family too."
2021-04-30 3:08,"""India blames a virus variant as its Covid 19 crisis deepens""
   There are many reasons to believe that a virus variant is responsible for the sudden surge in cases and the death. Some scientists may disagree.
   Many fully vaccinated doctors have come down with covid 19. How do you explain that? 
 “The current wave of Covid has a different clinical behavior,” It’s affecting young adults. It’s affecting families. It’s a new thing altogether. Two-month-old babies are getting infected.”
     Genome sequencing indicates the variant as a possible culprit.  The average prevalence of the variant surged to as high as 52% of samples sequenced in April from almost nothing in January, according to website tracker outbreak.info, which uses data from global repository GISAID.
    India’s health ministry first acknowledged the presence of a “double mutant” at the end of March but has downplayed it since. While it’s a variant of interest, it “has not been stamped as a ‘variant of concern’ so as to say that it is more lethal or more infectious.
   The B.1.617 variant has all the hallmarks of a very dangerous virus,” William A. Haseltine, a former professor at Harvard Medical School wrote in Forbes on April 12. “We must do all that is possible to identify its spread and to contain it."
2021-04-30 8:05,While the US numbers are starting to look much better - the original strain and some ugly mutations originated outside the US ... this could be the same scenario - and could derail our recovery plans.  The CCD and WHO are actively researching - would be nice to get their views or plans - even if preliminary.
2021-04-30 4:12,"I feel the mistake was India reopened prematurely when the vaccination rate was still very low 

Right now, I just hope India can vaccinate as fast as possible"
2021-04-30 5:28,"So you are quoting few doctors and call it “India blames”.  This was a clear case of mismanagement of health crisis and has it turned into humanitarian crisis.

Most of the deaths are because of lack of oxygen and therefore preventable.  How is that from new variant.  

Modi government did the right thing to have strict lockdown the first time, and utterly failed this time because they claimed premature victory for state elections, and now don’t want to admit their epic failure.  Even today BBC quoted the health minister saying oxygen supply is adequate.  Really.  If he has any shame he should resign right now."
2021-04-30 17:18,Modi made a few big mistakes: 1)he misled the country in believing that they had won the battle; 2) He did not prepare the country for any possible subsequent waves with medical supplies; 3) He encouraged the country to ignore protocols with Trumpian style political campaign; 4) He tried to compete with China with vaccine diplomacy while his country was still in deep infection trouble.
2021-04-30 16:08,"“We were not looking for variants at all,” he said. “In other words, we missed the boat.”

In fact, only in the UK are they ""looking for variants."" As the article explains, in the USA only 1% of 'cases' are subjected to genomic analysis.

I am beginning to think that the authorities don't really want to know about the variants.

While some may want to blame a variant, the simplest explanation is that India let down its guard and went back to normal and the world is witnessing the exponential growth of a virus out of control.

Nevertheless, anecdotally, doctors are wondering about new variants to explain covid infections after getting the jab. 

What this outbreak is doing is building interest in the mRNA vaccines as they are represented as more efficacious.

But...to be clear, people are dying because the medicine that could keep people alive (Ivermectin, a hydroxy cocktail; high dose fo Vitamin D, zinc, and other supplements) have been unavailable, a report from earlier news reported. Consequently, the need for oxygen is off the charts and people are dying because the virus was able to develop and spread within each host.

The world medical  community has put all of its eggs into the single vaccine basket for treating Covid 19 infections. This has been huge mistake.

Even the doctors who have been vaccinated with the Astra Zenecda jab are getting sick but they are not able to treat their own illness because there is no protocol for early symptoms."
2021-04-30 16:22,The burning of the dead by the thousands in the open air thus befouling that air which all must breathe is the height of idiocy.  Bury them.
2021-04-24 16:39,"I find this account to be disturbingly dystopian. I think of all the wonderful Indian friends and colleagues i have had over the years, and my heart goes out to them, their families, and their nation."
2021-04-24 16:56,"As I contemplate the potential fate of my loved ones, on the other side of the world in India, I cannot get myself to be optimistic. All signs indicate that things will get much more dire than they are now. 

Just complete failure from the Modi government to control misplaced optimism. Last month, they allowed crowds to attend cricket matches, and one could clearly see that masking/social distancing was nary in sight. The several million Kumbh mela attendees last week, will spread it to small towns and villages which are ill-equipped to deal with such an emergency. Further, the month of Ramzan going on right now, will also add fuel to this fire. Drastic steps are warranted. I hope eyes have opened."
2021-04-24 17:00,"Unfortunately it’s sweltering hot in much of India in the summer (going up to the 120s), which forces people indoors, and I think may be contributing to this surge in covid cases.  The winter there is a much more moderate 70-80 and more conducive to staying outdoors."
2021-04-24 17:22,"Firstly, Thank You for brave reporting. Please take all precautions. 
Situation is worse that worst of the reports. Something straight out of dystopian movies. Complete breakdown on health services. What is reported here is the major cities. Smaller cities, which in India still means million plus population, are underreported. Numbers presented by Indian government are off by 10 times, my guess based on sampling from friends and relatives. 
It’s a free for all situation, which is same as you are on your own. People have mostly resigned to their fate. Caring for their sick at home as much as they can, without any medicine or supplies. 
We are down to 'thoughts and prayers', as Americans aptly say after each, and at times self-made, tragedies. Which this one seems to be. Perhaps not man-made but for sure man-exacerbated. 
I am in the US originally from India and have all my extended family there. That said, at this time all countries must ban all travel, emergencies included, to/from India. At least till we know what this variant is and how to deal with it."
2021-04-24 17:29,We should know if people who are vaccinated in India are dying from the virus at higher rates than they should. Since these deaths are younger with fewer deaths per million then can we assume their vaccine prevents hospitalization? Without oxygen the case fatality rate is likely orders of magnitude higher for young people.
2021-04-24 17:37,"India handled the first wave effectively due to a strongly and suddenly imposed lockdown. That had economic repercussions for sure, but COVID-19 related deaths were low.

With the political executive across party lines reluctant to declare new lockdowns amidst the second wave, it is quite plausible to have a hundred thousand deaths each day by the end of June."
2021-04-24 17:39,"Very very unfortunate.  One year is the maximum any forced social distancing could have worked.  There was a long period where the infection counts were low and no one can be blamed for mutant versions and mayhem.  Science and scientists have been wrong on modelling, predictions, and in advising political leaders.  There was this premise that Indians have been exposed to a larger load of viruses and therefore are probably immune, that the median age is lower and such.  Vaccination could only have been started after they were approved and has rate limits,  The health care system has rarely able to provide a solution; you go in with one problem and you come out with a new problem.  The performance world over has been poor, and the worst may not be over everywhere."
2021-04-24 17:47,"Healthcare in India cannot be compared to the West; period.  What works is primary care, vaccinations and such.  The latter unfortunately has been rate limited by supplies and infrastructure.  There was this bluster from the Serum Institute guy that he had already produced some hundreds of millions of doses that were waiting to get out of the door.  Elders from the previous generations have always assumed that going to hospital means no return, unfortunately, that has not changed despite speciality clinics and hospitals.  People have never assumed that a Government can deliver and if there is new expectation, then it is fueled by social media."
2021-04-24 17:52,"In a very strange way, this is the first time in Western Media that I am seeing that individuals in other countries matter, maybe, because Covid has levelled the playing field, or that, India is better known through its IT people and exports of the same and such.  In the past four decades all I have seen is numbers and this is the first time I am seeing a human face of suffering; families, middle classes, and such.  This is important for educating the masses, as statistics don't mean anything."
2021-04-24 18:10,"Thank you for your good reporting. I am shocked that this is really the only article explicitly stating that India is drastically undercounting deaths and cases; the world needs better data, or at least, ""We just don't know anymore."" But 95% of what I am seeing on US news reports is the Indian government's official ""Blue Skies and Sunny Weather Report""  (relatively speaking) that give maybe 1-10% of the real numbers. Yeesh! So thank you for writing the truth, and stay safe."
2021-04-24 16:47,"This is horribly heartbreaking. These are largely educated, very civilized people whose culture has been around a hell of a lot longer than ours. What is going on with the Biden administration? Where is the UN? These are our friends! Let’s get them some oxygen tanks! Let’s have an airlift, how hard can it be? I bet we could relieve their oxygen shortage within a week. We can’t sit by and just watch. I’m crying for India."
2021-04-24 17:05,"What we are witnessing in India is what epidemiologists had already warned us of - Virus is like a forest fire looking for humanwood to burn. If you let your guard down, you're not only posing risk to yourself but also to your family, town, country and the entire world.

Most of this could have been minimized to manageable state, had they not lifted the restrictions with a bang i.e. 100% occupancy allowed in movie theatres, restaurants etc., And to boot, politicians were overconfident and spouted bombastic nonsense like ""India is the world pharmacy"", ""India is in the endgame of covid-19"" and people (not excusing their stupidity or callousness) fell for it.

As proven over the last year, no country in the world is equipped with infrastructure or resources to handle a sudden surge let alone a tsunami like this.   

And there was no vison; Indian government has been playing stall tactics and delayed the requests by vaccine manufacturers to help with expanding their production capacity to meet the demand, they finally approved a few days back, when all hell broke loose."
2021-04-24 18:06,"The official statistics belie the horrendous situation on the ground.

City after city is running out of places to do a final send off for their loved ones.

Hospitals are running out of oxygen.

It is a tragedy of unimaginable proportions.

This should have been anticipated, but during their official lull in cases November to February, the country forgot that covid existed.
The ruling party officially declared victory with the usual chest thumbing and the complicit and pliant media followed by projecting that false narrative.

Vaccines were sent to other countries in an unbelievable ""vaccine diplomacy"" when not even 1% of their population had been vaccinated.

They laughed and sneered at western nations including the US at the high case loads and declared themselves superior.

They paid scant attention to the poor migrants who went through hell last year. 

And now they are fudging their statistics to save face.

For shame."

Guess what? karma had a cruel sense of humor!!

We have gone through one disaster after another starting with demonetization, the economic disaster that was the GST roll out, reduction in poverty reduction subsidies like PDS (food stamps without means testing), religious lynching, stand off with China, COVID-19 disaster, the resulting economic disaster due to stagflation caused by an ill advised austerity measure and heavy taxation of fuel, the CAA and resulting violence ...

2021-04-24 17:48,"It is crystal clear that Modi is deliberately lying about the level of fatalities.

As the NYT has proved here, and with other reliable parties, including the BBC, reporting similar incidents from all over India, it seems highly likely that deaths are around ten times the reported figures.

And, as the epidemiologist Bhramar Mukherjee tells us, between 400,000 and 1,000,000 Indians have already died in India as a direct consequence of Covid-19. The global pandemic toll of the immorality and incompetence of the Former Guy administration will include millions of avoidable deaths."

2021-04-24 17:38,"This article was very hard to read about sorrow, suffering and death. India and other poor over populated countries will be hit hard by this tsunami. I hope Bangladesh and Indonesia see India and get prepared. 

The one sad outcome of the pandemic has been opinions which seem to mutate faster than this deadly virus.

Below is an snippet from the New Yorker dated March 1, 2021.Published in the print edition of the March 1, 2021, issue, with the headline “The Covid Conundrum. 

“And there lies an epidemiological mystery. The usual trend of death from infectious diseases—malaria, typhoid, diphtheria, H.I.V.—follows a dismal pattern. Lower-income countries are hardest hit, with high-income countries the least affected. But if you look at the pattern of covid-19 deaths reported per capita—deaths, not infections—Belgium, Italy, Spain, the United States, and the United Kingdom are among the worst off. The reported death rate in India, which has 1.3 billion people and a rickety, ad-hoc public-health infrastructure, is roughly a tenth of what it is in the United States. In Nigeria, with a population of some two hundred million, the reported death rate is less than a hundredth of the U.S. rate. Rich countries, with sophisticated health-care systems, seem to have suffered the worst ravages of the infection. Death rates in poorer countries—particularly in South Asia and large swaths of sub-Saharan Africa—appear curiously low."
2021-04-24 18:26,"I watched with dismay as covid controls and restrictions on businesses and people activity were progressively loosened, beginning slowly around last October, the onset of India’s festive season of Diwali, leading to the new year and thereon. By then, the Central Government had decided to bury its head in the sand, after receiving bruising and often brutal invective for its lockdown earlier in 2020 and restrictions, which in hindsight had perhaps helped control much of the first wave though at great human cost and economic suffering. They now left the onus of omission and commission to the State Governments, no better at the game, with varying degrees of ineptitude.

Meanwhile, the virus, which had lain low for the latter part of 2020 got an insidious boost with the gradual opening up and freeing up restrictions, people’s great lassitude at having lived the “covid life” for the better part of the year gone by, and of course the rise of the mutants. The political rallies in April and the great Indian religious spectacle called the “Kumbh Mela” at the banks of the Ganges were small contributors I feel, the larger part in the spread played out by loosening covid controls and people’s laxity. 

So, six months later, we are now where we are. The central premise of this article is quite correct, but in a population of 1.4 billion, unfortunately these deaths will get dehumanized and become a statistic, forgotten over time, buried in India’s interminable past."
2021-04-24 17:27,"I hope Indian Govt wouldn't consider banning NY Times, BBC, or any other western media for reporting truth. Most of indipendent and free nedia in India was effectively destroyed by the  ruling Modi Govt. They also successfully promoted a false sense of patriotism based on lies and religious fundamentalism to blame/abuse anyone who dare to highlight loopholes of Govt policies and hindu right-wing politics of RSS-BJP. 
Just wait and see how so many Indians start posting comments refusing this excellent article and promote the idea that western media are conspiring against India!

Why doesn't some wealthy Indian in the USA organise a commercial flight to fly oxygen/masks/asthma inhalers to India to save their fellow countrymen and woman. Actions speak louder than words.
2021-04-24 17:50,"The fault for this is squarely on the shoulders of PM Modi, his cronies and enablers of which there are many. A right-wing religious ideologue, a master of political theatre, skilled in the art of Muslim-baiting, but completely at sea in actually governing.

Interesting isn't it how folks such as Modi, Trump, Bolsonaro - anti-facts and anti-science - are great at motivating and captivating their base, living in a different reality, denying what doesn't suit their worldview - and leaving death and destruction in their wave . . ."
2021-04-24 17:01,There are so many endless cremations that the air and sky is becoming polluted.
2021-04-24 17:37,"It isn't just oxygen. These people need anti-inflammatory drugs.

Shoving O2 into lungs that aren't functioning, does little good.

Treat the symptoms."
2021-04-24 17:05,"To allow MILLIONS of people to gather during a highly contagious pandemic seems outrageously macabre -- as if 'thinning the herds' is part of the government's ultimate plan!  

So tragically sad for India's good people to be at the mercy of willful ignorance.   'But for the grace of God go us' if Biden hadn't been elected . . ."
2021-04-24 17:59,Prematured celebration by those in power sent a wrong signal and Indian Public also couldn't restrict themselves anymore due to financial stress... also tells us how much control we have on a single Virus with all the advancement and technology humanity created. The global co-operation could still be much better... I desperately hope things will turn around in couple of months..
2021-04-24 18:04,"Top three reasons for this man made disaster:
Modi, Modi and Modi.

So sad & shocking. 

My acquaintances who are Modi supporters are already invoking reasons like fate/circumstance/bad luck etc. The battle for pinning the blame on something else is already raging on social media."
2021-04-24 17:55,"Election time. Federal and state Gov.  permit  religious festival to proceed  where they campaign for ruling party.  For people with religious extremism, it is kamikaze mission. In praying to god to save them, they destroy themselves with second wave of Covid-19 and allow virus to mutate to various forms amongst the crowd.  May be there will be third wave.  With a high population density,  virus spread is like wildfire!  As the column points out it is ""massacre of data"". Undercounting is common practice by corrupt and nervous politicians during election time."
2021-04-24 18:14,"The current administration does not give out numbers that makes them look bad, the situation is terrible, rural India is affected this time, non existent options for poor to get proper treatment, no preparations whatsoever. God help!"
2021-04-24 16:51,"This is a humanitarian crisis.  Maskless election rallies and the leader touting the crowd count, we saw this movie in November.  Modi and Trump, both megalomaniacs who led their countrymen to disasters.

I hope President Biden releases the AstraZeneca stockpile for India since it is just sitting around pending FDA approval."
2021-04-24 17:00,"All these leaders - Modi, Trump and Bolsanoro - seem to have one thing in common - powerless and clueless when disaster strikes. They care about politics rather than health and wellbeing of the population during the pandemic. 

Modi was busy having massive campaign rally in the Indian state of West Bengal on last Saturday, with massive crowds without social distancing and proper precautions to prevent spread of COVID-19. He even avoided wearing a mask during the rally  saying “I’ve never seen such huge crowds” .

That night he said “India had defeated Covid last year and India can do it again” following a virtual meeting with health officials who spoke of critical shortages of drugs, vaccines and other supplies in a nation that has seen a string of new daily records in the past two weeks."
2021-04-24 16:53,So India can’t count all the dead and Brazil has a starvation epidemic due to coronavirus and now finally the slight risk of a blood clot from J&J’s one dose vaccine has been outweighed.  But are they really sure?
2021-04-24 16:48,"""Each day, the government reports more than 300,000 new infections, almost half of all new cases in a global surge.""

These generalities in numbers really are disservice to readers and especially victims, the true number as of yesterday was 346,786 and 32.9% of new global cases."
2021-04-24 17:09,The utter failure of India and Brazil to contain the spread of the virus is so heartbreaking. We have a responsibility to help these people.
2021-04-24 16:52,"Both Indian Govt, and more importantly most state Govts in India are known to suppress Covid19 infection and death numbers. West Bengal Govt dustributed official circular to hospitals to deny Covid19 as the reason of death. Many, probably most, people there are not able to get rhe test and care. Those huge number of deaths are not included in official Covid19 death tally. 

Vaccine distribution is significantly low number and it's marred with rampant corruption, as expected. People mainly in urban areas with influence are getting vaccine while others are denied. 

The worst is huge political campaigns AND massive religious gatherings like Kumbh mela. Both of which was openly promoted by ruling Modi Govt."
2021-04-24 17:01,We need to build vaccine factories around the world just as fast as we built munitions factories in WWII.  We need a Marshall Plan to fight the virus.
2021-04-24 18:31,A travesty. Made worse because we all saw it coming a mile away. The US has its supply secured; it’s time to start the global vaccination campaign.
2021-04-24 18:14,"This is why people HAVE to get vaccinated. (I'm talking to you, all you vax holdouts)...

Doctors worry that the runaway surge is being at least partly driven by the emergence of a virus variant known as the “double mutant,” B.1.617, because it contains genetic mutations found in two other difficult-to-control versions of the coronavirus. One of the mutations is present in the highly contagious variant that ripped through California earlier this year. The other mutation is similar to one found in the South African variant and believed to make the virus more resistant to vaccines."
2021-04-24 17:28,"The situation is bad in India. It's very similar to what has been happening in Brazil. Sadly both are lead by populist leaders with a cult following, and they seem to be gleeful to get sick and potentially die due to their beliefs. It's sad since they could have taken the right steps during their last elections, and we'll see how it plays out in India. But the fact is thousands are still gathering for political rallies, and living life like it's a normal year tells me it's going to get worse until it gets better. It's a shame how pure ignorance and selfishness is why the world is struggling with covid."
2021-04-24 17:55,"Another balancing act in reporting has been reached by showing the final rites of the deceased of all religions.  With the current political atmosphere in India, it would be wrong to show the final rites of one particular religion leaving room for wrong interpretations, that some communities have been marginalized.  The virus knows no religion."
2021-04-24 17:20,"No surprise on the under-reporting. I know someone who was a medical student in Bhopal during the gas tragedy, who was pulled into emergency duty for several days/nights straight, and who observed that the officially reported deaths were a small fraction of what their hospital logbook had noted."
2021-04-24 18:00,"we need to persuade the Biden administration to help India now by releasing critical supplies, oxygen, vaccines, etc. If you know any way to get this message across, please share. Every hour counts, the situation is devastating."
2021-04-24 18:07,"I suppose here we can see the real impact of our “flatten the curve” policies. Without medical intervention, people die at much higher rates of COVID. 

I hope for the best for India that they can get the numbers down to manageable levels."
2021-04-24 16:57,"This is heart wrenching. India has 4 times the population of the US and yet only 1/3rd the # of deaths. Anyway, the luck seems to have run out and the government’s well thought out strategy to wish it away has failed spectacularly. Who does that remind me of here? How India escaped this virus until now is a mystery that scientists must find out. Why now and not 4 months ago?"
2021-04-24 16:50,"“Many deaths are not getting recorded and they are increasing every day,”...because “they don’t want to create panic.”  Well, that doesn't seem to be working.  It's astounding that government leaders in so many countries forget that they're there for their citizens.  If there are problems, be LEADERS by stating the facts and then acting to deal with the problem.  If you're unhappy with reality, the only thing accomplished by sweeping it under the carpet is that things get worse.  This happens regularly across the planet, but no one learns from it."
2021-04-24 18:36,"With variants continuing to develop it is clear that COVID is far from done with us on planet Earth. I work as a contact tracer supporting the state of Massachusetts in its efforts to contain the pandemic here. In recent weeks I have called households where vital transmission was identified as being connected to out of state travel. Florida has come up more than once in those calls. This is unsurprising considering how cavalier the state has often been about COVID when compared with the Northeast.

Between what is happening in Brazil and India it is clear COVID is a mass disruptor. And why would we imagine we are done with COVID here in the USA? With billions of people still not vaccinated the virus has plenty of people to continue mutating in.

Based on my research during my time working in COVID response and relief these last 11 months I think a surge in the Northern Hemisphere winter of 2021-2022 is virtually certain. It might be a marginal surge but it will likely surge. And perhaps even with a variant not even yet known about.

Until we start caring more about poverty and stop making our world revolve around money we will all continue to be at some risk of COVID due to the many parts of the world where it will continue to mutate for months to come as poverty keeps a vaccine out of reach.

It's a sobering world we live in now. 2021 is the drunken hangover of 2020. Perhaps in 2022 we will finally regain our bearings? I'm not especially optimistic."
2021-04-24 18:33,"Think of the worst information you have read about Covid in India and multiply it by 10. The situation is worst than that. It is difficult to wrap brain around how bad it is. My uncle who is a pedetrician in India in a city not yet in news is witnessing heart wrenching cases. The Government has fooled and devided people through fear mongering. Instead of investing in crucial infrastructure like healthcare and education, Modi kept the stoking fears of majority Hindus in with lies and deception. The government has failed people. I can only hope enough citizens would see it."
2021-04-24 16:41,If the people here in the US don't get vaccinated we could be looking at yet another wave here. Trump and his whole family (along with republicans in congress) have been vaccinated so his supporters need to follow his lead and GET VACCINATED. That we can get to herd immunity by summer and then travel and enjoy friends and family knowing we are not infecting them or worse.
2021-04-24 17:09,"Even though governments are feeling stretched we've (US/Canada/UK/EU/Australia) got to do more to help South Asian countries during this time where the variants are raging. The death and despair these countries are experiencing, particularly India, is unprecedented and there is a moral imperative to act.  

Also, this wave of death, sickness, and unrest in the region will likely have global health and geopolitical ramifications that may further shift the balance of power in the region towards China"
2021-04-24 17:08,"“From all the modeling we’ve done, we believe the true number of deaths is two to five times what is being reported.”

This was always going to be the case in India, just as it is in China.  The only question is why it has taken a year for people to admit this."
2021-04-24 16:51,"A horrifying situation for the Indians.  It's my understanding that   United Airlines will resume flights from India to the US tomorrow, 4/25.  Also note that much of our generic pharmaceuticals come from India - be prepared for a supply chain interruption.   Have a good day."
2021-04-24 17:46,"There are times when we Indians must reflect on who we are, see the connections between what we believe, say, and do - in light of what we precipitate collectively (a Covid catastrophe when large scale manufacturing of vaccines was in the realm of possibilities).

First, production is fine, logistics is everything.  A culture of corruption makes this a very toxic combination.  We couldn't care less about building a real infrastructure to gets products from here to there.  Every government official and department serves as a roadblock, wants a pay off, before letting anything happen.  We need to get rid of this immediately (government officials are hoarding vaccines, oxygen, and demanding money to admit patients to hospitals).

But this government reflects us; no one imposed this on us.  For the previous 40 years, everything good in India is about to happen.  It never happens.  Roads are built, to some point.  Bridges are unfinished, and connect only disparate locations.  Corruption is reduced in some, but not all places.  Filth is everywhere.  A culture of hubris makes all this very toxic.  To hear us talk, we'd think we are about to become an advanced nation when our per capita GDP is ridiculously low.  The hubris about our immunity, our genetic make up, and other complete nonsense is killing people.

The injustice of all this can break our spirits.  Every one of us likes to think we are a genius.  Facts on the ground reveal we are exactly the opposite, and incurably so."
2021-04-24 18:53,"I’ve been holding on by the skin of my teeth, afraid to call my family in India for the daily checklist of who is ok and who is not. Praying that my loved ones continue to stay safe. 

This article broke me. 

It pulled me out of my far-away privileged life and reminded me that I come from a place where at any given moment your lives can be reduced to ashes and no can can or will help. 

Thank you for this very important work."
2021-04-24 19:30,"As we in the U.S. close in on vaccinating all of the citizens who want the vaccine we should not stockpile the vaccine reserves for months while trying to convince our vaccine hesitant citizens to take it.

Instead we should redirect those resources towards places in the world that are being overrun with infections.

That would also be to the benefit of all of us in the U.S. As COVID-19 infections spread unchecked in human populations around the globe the virus has more time and opportunity to mutate in to more resistant strains which are sure to find their way to our shores eventually."

2021-04-24 18:49,"Very sad to read/see this playing out in India today. India is complex in many ways. Globally, Kudos to the R&D people who developed the vaccines in record time. 95% protection is great. However, Would WE Accept 95% in other situations? Example: Drive your car..  great brakes – they work “95%” of the time!! Great tires - they are “safe 95%” of the time?? Our water is safe to drink… “95% of the time!!?” What, NO WAY, YOU SAY? Globally, everyone has a role & responsibility to help and protect each other. In my view, Ken Frazier, CEO of Merck said it well early on. None of us are safe till all of us are safe! Previously, I served as Chairman & MD of India region for 2 large American companies. There are many unique challenges there and I hope they get it under control soon."

2021-04-24 19:35,The human population is reaching or has acutely reached the carrying compacity of the earth. I am surprised so many are surprise that  we can t contain a global pandemic
2021-04-24 20:09,"I was in India few weeks back and I agree with this article about vast under reporting by the government. We have family members that are impacted that are never part of the statistics.  I was shocked by the large rallies for elections and lack of social distancing and mask use esp in the two southern states I have visited.  This was purely brought up on people by politicans to satisfy their ego's. Government Covid task force from my understanding has not met in Feb and March, just gross negligence of their duty.  These in power must be held responsible, as we deserve better."
2021-04-24 21:03,"In a country with a population of 1.35 billion, it's obvious that a lot of people will contract COVID-19 and that a lot of people will die with it.  Apparently, India does not require a physician's attestation about the cause of death; but even multiplying the reported deaths by 5 as Dr.  Mukherjee proposes, the mortality rate in India would be 80 per 100,000--less than half of that in the US and many Western European countries.  The vast difference in the percentage of people in India 65 years old and older versus the percentages in the West could easily account for the difference.  The reality is that countries lacking robust health care systems suffer more deaths, and the sheer numbers from India make it appear worse than large countries in Latin America.  The reality is that these are the very countries that need to increase the numbers of people vaccinated.  It's up to their health ministries to assure that the number of vaccinations increases as quickly as possible and that that their citizens are not unduly influenced by anti-vaccine social media."
2021-04-24 18:40,"Just as bad as Trump - ignoring science and putting religion before science. As Trump would say, thoughts and prayers. In god we trust everyone else pays by cheque, credit card or cash. 
Our governments in NZ and Australia listened to science and not religious zealots. We had a couple of outbreaks of community transmission in NZ because of religious groups ignoring lockdowns until we all got on facebook and hammered them into submission. It's all about our team of 5 million listening to science. Thank goodness NZ is a secular democracy and not a religious theocracy.
Another thing that needs to be thought about is that the covid-19 virus keeps mutating and spreading faster and faster. I'd hate to think what all that mass spreading of the virus in India has evolved into. Indian govt probably needs to let WHO into India to see if there are any new strains of this virus that can only spread through the nose, mouth, eyes etc because it fuels itself on human contact."
2021-04-24 18:51,"This is a painful read. I live and work in Ahmedabad and some of the hospitals mentioned here would be the places I would go to I had tested positive or someone I knew did. My friend whose father passed away a few days told  me about the horrors and pain in some of the hospitals he had to take his father to get treatment. Moreover, he mentioned he was lucky they finally got a bed in a decent hospital after the countless calls he had to make to folks in his network. Imagine having none of that and left to suffer. 

The blatant arrogance of our leadership and their clueless or pathetic management is why we have this situation. If one begins to ask questions, it would be a long list and met with no answers and zero logic replies from friends of the leadership. We have a leadership bereft of empathy, compassion, ability to make consensus political decisions and see every situation as a political opportunity to fortify their power. 

Only God knows when we will overcome this virus and this leadership."
2021-04-24 19:44,"The Black Plague (called so because it arrived via the Mongols and the Black Sea to Byzantium then into Europe) is estimated to have killed half of Europe in roughly 5 years. 400 million souls lost to a putrid disease of massive boils and suffocation. 

Consider these numbers. 400 million. It is this plague that created the groundwork erupting 50 or so years later in the Renaissance. The old world had literally died off. 

We are at that transition. At the forefront of AI, and a true vision of the future, we are also prey to a tiny microbe warning us, along with Climate Change, of humankind's immense fragility in the face of natural forces. 

There are too many of us. Too many humans for a tiny overburdened planet. The planet is responding. Yet the cruelty of disease vectors, like so much of what confronts humanity, is the exposure of the poor and downtrodden to calamity. 

The very wealthy consistently get away with it, as it were. There weren't enough people left in the Europe of 1347 to farm the fields. So laws were written to garner more work from the remaining workforce, to freeze wages, and to basically keep life as harsh as possible for the surviving serfs, leading eventually to humanism, revolution, to science and change. 

Climate Change may be the reckoning necessary to awaken the rich to empathy. We'll see. Meanwhile the poor worldwide, forced to work  amid the pandemic, will pay the price for us all."
2021-04-24 20:41,"""Fatalities have been overlooked or downplayed, understating the human toll of the country’s outbreak, which accounts for nearly half of all new cases in a global surge.""

Good grief.  This scenario sounds famiiar in many ways when the prior president and his administration were doing their best to ""contain"" the situation by reporting ""alternative"" facts and information.

What really makes no sense at all is that ""less than 10% of Indians have gotten even one dose, despite India being the world's leading vaccine manufacturer.""  And yet, here in this country, vaccination centers are closing because of lower turn outs for the vaccine.

Such unwarranted and unnecessary death and loss."
2021-04-24 18:39,"Despite of all this reporting, packed trains and buses  are still running and many are visiting religious places and most without masks. With this high levels of viral replication even more lethal mutants are bound to emerge. The prime minister and his government have basically surrounded to this virus. He is focused on elections and staying in power instead of the people he plans to rule forever."
2021-04-24 18:50,"I wouldn’t worry about undercounting for the recorded death toll worldwide is grossly exaggerated. In Spain, new cases and deaths are reported up to the minute yet if you ask how many people have died of anything other than the virus since the pandemic began no one can give a figure. They’re simply lumping everything as Covid-19 which is reckless and irresponsible."
2021-04-24 20:19,"According to the serological surveys conducted between August and September 2020, the case counts are 30-fold higher than what is reported.  So far roughly 400 million.  Another billion hosts are available for the virus.

I am an Indian-American scientist and hear it is truly horrific.  No O2 tanks available for love or money -- no matter how privileged you are.  People literally on their knees begging hospital staff for a bed.

This wave will devastate India and likely result in 5-10 million deaths.  Let us not forget that of the 50 million who died in the 1918 Spanish flu 18 million were Indian (6% of the population at the time).

My prayers and thoughts are with everyone in India.  The frontline doctors and health care workers and home care staff are true heroes."
2021-04-24 17:24,"I hope America and Americans are proud of themselves. While the world suffers with uncontrolled COVID-19 spread, America is preventing the export of key vaccine manufacturing ingredients, and vaccine.

In the one case where America did ""load"" Canada and Mexico AtraZ vaccine, that vaccine was manufactured in a facility was shutdown by the FDA. So we gave our neighbours tainted vaccines.

Trust me, the world will not forget, and it will cost us dearly."
2021-04-24 17:06,I grieve for families I know in Western India. Politicians in many countries have done incalculable harm to their people and Modi and others were reckless in their pursuit of success in the polls.

Even as we have vaccines and treatments that can reduce the death toll, this disease seems relentless.

But India has always had a knack to recover; the old civilizational tools of survival are there.  Modern societies, without wealth to smother, would break; not India."
2021-04-24 18:30,"Reading this well researched and informative article was like watching a horror movie and pausing it multiple times to take a break from the tension and fear of what comes next. I do hope President Biden can rush some of the ear marked Covid-19 aid to send to India to procure liquid oxygen. The reporting was from major cities. One can only imagine the horror playing out in rural India where there are no hospitals for 100s of miles around, no infrastructure such as continuous power and water supply or sealed roads. I do hope we can share some of our vaccines with Mexico/Latin America and Canada. Many states have unused vaccines due to the slow down in the uptake of vaccines here in the US."
2021-04-24 18:25,Thanks for highlighting the facts and not succumbing to the pressures of the Indian government to control the news media. Its unfortunate that most mainstream Indian newspapers publish reports from international news media on what's the Covid situation here rather than having a suggestion of their own or be critical of the government. The world needs to know what's happening here for a fact other than the marketing gimmicks done by the Indian government.
2021-04-24 18:07,"""Fatalities have been overlooked or downplayed, understating the human toll of the country’s outbreak, which accounts for nearly half of all new cases in a global surge.""

Good grief.  This scenario is eerily familiar in the US in so many ways when the other guy was president.  If I didn't know better, I would think he was India's president.

2021-04-24 18:21,"Why dont you also mention the USA a supposed so-called ally to India has not lifted the ban or restrictions on the export of COVID-19 vaccine raw materials despite of India's request to lift ban. Instead of extending a hand in support of a member of the QUAD, they sent their naval ships to the Indian Ocean into Indian waters without any diplomatic outreach. In addition, they allege India has been manipulating the currency. What an apt time to do all passive aggression.  I love how patronising this article paints the subcontinent. Yes the situation is heartbreaking and gutwrenching but oh the patronisation of this article.  As someone living in India and seeing this play out to me it heartbreaking. We are organising oxygen supplies, plasma and food for those who are quarantining at home. Many people are staying inside and try to help where they can."
2021-04-24 16:57,"When we give only raw number “news” and not a real statistical perspective, we are doing a disservice to information. Sometimes it seems that we are sadly happy to see a country worse off than us, but numbers should never be given without context.

what else to do?"
2021-04-24 17:31,Thank You for Covering this. I relatives in India tell me the same thing. The Death Numbers reported are only a fraction of them.  The world needs to pay attention to resolve this. India could become fertile ground for more aggravated Variant as times goes by. Nations across the world need to pay attention.
2021-04-24 19:12,"This is likely to become a big problem for the US. Like many third world countries, India had been doing much better against covid than the 'advanced' countries like the US and UK. The death rate per 100,000 for the pandemic today stands at 14 in India versus 174 in the US. 

In early March the case numbers in India started to explode. The only sensible explanation for that is a shift in the behavior of the virus due to a new mutation. This is similar to the explosion in the UK caseload that occurred when their new variant emerged in December. That UK variant went on to kill thousands of Americans when it drove late winter  surges in the US. The Indian variant is likely to do the same to unvaccinated US populations when it arrives here.

The thousands of American deaths due to the UK covid variant were entirely preventable. Three thousand miles of Atlantic ocean separate the US and the UK. Strict international travel restrictions of the type imposed by New Zealand and Taiwan could have kept the UK and Indian variants out of the US. Unfortunately, pressure from multi-national corporations, immigrant communities and the media have lead to inadequate restrictions on global travel. 

All our progress on covid could be undone if a vaccine resistant strain enters the US. There is no excuse for allowing mutant forms of covid to spread across borders. President Biden should immediately impose strict restrictions on international travel to keep new covid mutations out of the US."

2021-04-24 19:45,"US and other ""rich"" countries (Australia, Brazil, EU, Japan, UK) blocking TRIPS waiver (IP rules for medical products) are witnessing what happens when people are not provided with Covid-19 vaccines timely enough. India and South Africa have been calling for this waiver since last October. 

Who can be ever benefited from prolonging this pandemic? Certainly not us, nor anyone else in the world. It does not end in our soil until it ends everywhere else in the world. While we are protecting interests of big-pharma and competing to secure limited vaccine supply, more variants can come into being which can easily negate our hard-won accomplishments. As a New Yorker who went through the horror early last year, I DO NOT WANT to repeat the experience ever again.  

Please stop blocking the waiver further so that India and other developing countries can produce much needed Covid-19 vaccines and other medical products on their own to save lives. U.S. can. To truly build back our country, it is crucial to restore our moral authority. We can't afford to lose this war. Later, I hope to be able to say that we Americans did stand up for people in the world as well as ourselves again as we did before."
2021-04-24 20:24,"The inevitable culling of humans has begun. A fundamental of scientific Ecology is that organisms cannot long exceed the carrying capacity of the ecosystem in which it resides. If the carrying capacity is exceeded then, through time, the size of the population will be reduced to that carrying capacity. We humans have grossly exceeded the carrying capacity of our niche, and a reduction in our numbers is inevitable. The COVID-19 virus likely evolved into a human pathogen due in part, or completely, to the effects of humans. If we were wise we would do our best to reduce the size of our numbers and, to the full extent possible, remedy the damage and destruction we have caused. New pathogens are  in our future, and will prove as difficult, or more difficult, to control the COVID-19 pathogen."
2021-04-24 17:32,"Reading about this horrific period in Indian life, as an American in the United States, makes it all the more infuriating to hear people in the U.S. talk about not feeling the urgency of this pandemic. I hope more people in ""1st world countries"" would pay attention to how covid is affecting other countries with far less access to basic healthcare and sanitary living conditions. It may be an option for a ""healthy"" young American to not fear for their life, but it is certainly disheartening to witness people not willing to acknowledge how their carelessness is a privilege, and continuing to be the source of virus spread is literally killing those less fortunate than yourself."
2021-04-24 17:06,"5 times which is reported (the most pessimistic estimation) makes around 10,000 deaths/day in India. Translated into the US population, it would give around 2,000 deaths/day. The US peak was over 3,000."
2021-04-24 18:21,"Recent surge can be directly blamed on the millions of the devotees who gathered and participated in religious  fair on the banks of a river in Hardiwar which lasted  for 1 month .This was not banned despite corners and protests by secular institutions an day medical community .

Recent elections in certain states   brought truck loads of  out- of--state people from other provinces . People from Bihar, UP and Jharkhanda joined  the electoral rallies in Assam and Bengal to create and distort  the impression of magnitude of the support RSS-BJP enjoyed in Bengal and Assam . Obviously rallies contributed to the spread of the infections to the rural areas hitherto unknown . The infection rate also contributed to the untold numbers of  mutations."

2021-04-24 21:11,"It isn't just oxygen. These people need anti-inflammatory drugs.

Shoving O2 into lungs that aren't functioning, does little good.

2021-04-24 18:10,"Covid is a strange beast; some 25% of 200 or so people I interacted with in the US either got  the virus, or were quarantined because of an acquaintance getting it.  One out of 200 spent a day in the hospital and recovered.  The mean age of this group was 35.  That 1/200 survived in US because of the healthcare system, and that same scenario in India is not working, unfortunately.  The story has been universally bad for the older age groups."
2021-04-24 18:42,"Thank you for reporting on our plight. The report is accurate to the extent that deaths and cases are being underreported. We are helpless. There is no governmental support.

We are marooned, helpless. Please save us, we have nowhere to go."

2021-04-24 17:45,"Covid is running rampant over the rest of the world ( Brazil, India and even Europe) and we ( the US) have our heads buried in the sand about this. We are in a good place with vaccine availability and our case rates ( although some places areworse than others). At this point we should help these nations with oxygen, ventilators and maybe even vaccines ( all those AstraZeneca vaccines we have and are not going to use).  Some places such as Europe and India can even make their own vaccines but lack ingredients we are holding and we should supply some. People remember when we help them in their time of need. Let it not be said that China and Russia were there in their time of need and not America."
2021-04-24 17:20,"We have thousands of appointments going unfilled. Ship some of those vaccines. Our non-vaxxers don't want them. Save some lives.

2021-04-24 20:41,"And what has the government of India, led by a religious right party done? See the report from ""Caravan"", a magazine published in India

""Since January, the government machinery has done little to prepare the country for the second wave. In mid April, the union health minister Harsh Vardhan called upon ministry officials to make “significant development” on research projects that seek to scientifically validate the benefits of indigenous cows, telling the officials that “Covid-19 pandemic cannot be used as an excuse for this delay.”

Yes, proving the benefits of local bovines is certainly more important than implementing good public health policies."
2021-04-24 18:44,"Just imagine if the United States had had an actual adult in charge when the pandemic started, instead of Donald Trump.  

Instead of a President shrugging his shoulders, walking away from his duties and and letting individual states ""mangage"" the crisis in a hunger games free-for-all, we could have had a coordinated, rational containment effort that would have included global coordination on both contact tracing and vaccine distribution.

Trump is directly responsible for half a million needless American deaths, but he also made the United States partially responsible for the chaos in the rest of the world as well.  

For shame."
2021-04-24 16:44,"Even if we multiply the 2000 deaths by 5 (the most pessimistic undercounts according to the article) that's still below the US January peak, and below the peak most European countries have encountered. While the Indian situation is not great, it is no worse than elsewhere, so this article is too alarmist. Remember that India is 1.3 billion people, of course, the absolute death toll count is high, but what is important is the relative death toll."
2021-04-24 19:51,"China is a monolithic society of more than 1 billion people. The next three most populous nations -- India, the United States of America, and Indonesia -- are all multicultural; and in the case of India and Indonesia, diverse cultures millennia deep.

Keep that in mind, as we try to negotiate our position in a post-sole-superpower global society."

2021-04-24 18:32,"At this moment, I have an Indian houseguest living in my home for a few months. 

Yesterday he said to me “I think the numbers are underreported; every time I phone home, my friends tell me they have a family member who has Covid. It seems as if everyone has it. It has never been like this the past year or so.” 

He then shared stories about how poor communication to the people has resulted in large group events and  people gathering in huge groups. 

It’s a nightmare. 

."
2021-04-24 17:01,"I blame this horrifying tragedy squarely at the doorstep of the present government. Complacency thwarted forward planning for the second wave. The BJP was flaunting Prime Minister Modi as ""Vaccine Guru"" just a few weeks ago, and declaring victory in the war against COVID-19. Now, the situation has spiraled out of control, so the authorities resorting to under-reporting in order to control the narrative. 
This may fly with a pliant media but, epidemiologically, data manipulation is a recipe for disaster because it obscures the virus's spatial distribution and trajectory. 

Perhaps, Prime Minister Modi will now don the mantle of ""Covid Guru"" as his citizens needlessly suffer and die? I am gripped by anxiety for my friends in India, and beyond outraged that it has come to this."
2021-04-24 17:16,"The devastation caused by the covid pandemic would have been the perfect opportunity for the United States to 'show leadership' and help India on the grand scale. It would have cemented a lasting close friendship.
This new and improved administration chose to hoard vaccines and other supplies instead.
'Back at the head of the table? Not really."
2021-04-24 18:24,"And here in the states we are letting down our guard, opening restaurants, bars and millions boarding airplanes. I just fear for where we will be a yea from now."
2021-04-24 17:53,"This article goes to great lengths top describe how India's ban on export of vaccines is affecting poor countries. Yet it completely fails to mention that America's ban on export of vaccine raw materials is the primary reason vaccine manufacturing is grinding to a trickle in India. This article is about India's suffering, is it not?"
2021-04-24 21:50,"This shows we need a coordinated global response to Covid-19.  We can't go on shutting down some countries, while other countries open up and the virus rages and mutates in those other countries, and shut-downs result, and in the meantime the first set of countries open up and then new variants charge in and mutate there, and so on and so on, back and forth, reinfecting each other.   

The virus variants will continue to flourish in a disorganized world.  We will be masked and socially distanced and partially shut down for years.  We need to get a grip and have a global  three-month shutdown on international travel, a global simultaneous six-week shutdown to get the virus under control.  And vaccines and vaccination be the priority of every nation.  Otherwise, we are just playing around, hoping vainly that we will bumble through."
2021-04-24 22:19,"With these current problems, consider a macro view of population.  The total earth population was 4.0 billion in 1974 and has increased by 3.4 billion in the intervening 46 years up to 2020.  And this means just adding an equivalent 3.4 billion more with the same growth rate may only take 23 years because of the proportionally much larger starting population of 7.4 million in 2020.  Is humanity equipped to deal with this?"
2021-04-24 18:52,"Problem comes when you suppress views different from what you want to believe. So called experts in committees, who are professionals are pure sycophants. They boast about being in the high level committees, and loved giving ‘expert’ opinions and statements to the press. All have gone underground now.
I just hope that the government is working with real numbers and not the make believe ones that are for public consumption. Else ..."
2021-04-24 21:35,So if this is happening in India it can happen anywhere. Does anyone really believe that our world will really be getting back to anything even approaching normal? If these variants are multiplying and duplicating themselves at warp speed in a progression which is capable of making our variety of vaccines obsolete then what is the prognosis? Booster shots in perpetuity? Indefinite lockdowns? Triple masking? Just the fatigue of all of these restrictions and precautions on their own is enough to send you over the edge. The trouble is that the virus is an extremely intelligent serial killer. That's the real story behind the headlines. What's happening with India can happen here in the US. We're not too far behind.
2021-04-24 21:26,"The problem is what scientist have already warned, unless 70 % of the world is vaccinated no one is vaccinated"
2021-04-24 20:21,"Now that we have President Biden and Vice-President Harris in the White House, it is my hope that the United States can dramatically increase Covid19 vaccination production and storage to help vaccinate people in poorer countries."
2021-04-24 21:53,"Like others here I was in India for several months. Initially I thought their low infection rates were not only due to the lockdown but also due to their excellent inmune system.  No one survives in India without one, because there is no sewage and no garbage recollection, the latter left out to feed the goats.  But now they're dying and that is worrisome for us.  It means the virus is more powerful than expected and those mutations will get here in the US, soon.  I find this India horror a very unsettling news."
2021-04-24 19:51,"Indians are naturally resistant to COVID because of resistance to viruses similar to COVID built up by growing up in a less than stellar environment. But that’s the original COVID that just made the jump to human and aren’t very good at spreading among humans.

With enough people infected and enough resistance encountered, it’s only a matter of time before the virus mutated to suit human better."
2021-04-24 21:53,"On one hand, I understand the anger towards Modi.
However, on the other hand, don't forget the considerations and constraints of a democracy and free speech, even if some deny that these exist in India.
Imagine the final outcome for any Indian politician clamping down as severely as China to suppress the virus. Just imagine the chaos if the 12 year religious festival is banned or access to the Ganges is denied. Combine this with the hubris (apologies, if I may use this word here) stirred up through being asked to be part of the Quad's vaccine strategy to counter China. 
Even if India has a superhuman as PM, it is doubtful that he can do very much."
2021-04-24 22:13,"Populist demagogues like Trump, Bolsinaro, Modi who pander to religious fanatics who ignore science don't seem to be a good job in controlling the COVID 19 Pandemic.  I wonder why."
2021-04-24 22:16,"It is heartbreaking to read this ""COVID Deaths Go Undercounted"" in India. India needs helps now and we should do our part first. .
If India is a complex country, which it is, then COVID-19 and its culprit, SARS-C0V-2 is no less complex either. The country that had done reasonably well till a couple of months ago is in dire strait now because the virus had changed its strategy and stealthily infecting people when they lowered their guards. No one should simply blame the people or the government of any country for this because it is much more nuanced than that. Poverty is a known preventable risk factor for infectious diseases but who knew ignorance, religious -activity, political partisanship, and even basic need to earn a living could be added to the risk factors for this dreadful diseases. What is happening in India now will very likely spill to other south asian countries because NOTHING can really prevent these variants from crossing the political borders in due time or even continents. The neighboring countries are similarly populated with even lower vaccinate rates. Just accept it that even the best of world's experts are at a loss to fully understand the behavior of this virus, the ebbs and flows  in spikes and extreme spikes. Masking and social distancing works to an extent. As of now, vaccination, mass global vaccination is the only hope to reduce the calamity that India is going through now and other countries may go through if they were not adequately vaccinated."
2021-04-24 20:05,"The right wing in the US have the right to not wear masks, to not get vaccinated, to get the virus and die.  That is good for the  next elections.  They are lemmings. Cool.   The right wing in India unfortunately are killing everyone, right and left with the virus. There is not much talk about the millions of untouchables in the slums with no health care. My guess is the number of cases and deaths are double or triple what has been reported."

So did all the right-wingers, except where they started screaming about black helicopters. We’ve been TOLD since December what’ll happen if we don’t get everybody vaccinated and maintain precautions for the next couple months, and guess what? Same reactions. Hey, it’s only maybe 800 or so dead Americans every day, kids in the hospital with weird syndromes, more and more long-haulers. Price of freedonia, really. 

The one thing Modi did that we didn’t to here is try and impose a natinal lockdown with absolutely no plans for getting people fed. Other than that, exactly the same combo of politics, incompetence and panic. Same thing in Brazil. All coming out of the Right.

Again, only diff is we’re richer, more spread out, and have better support. So don’t tell me we were one whit smarter than India between February ‘20 and January ‘21. And if half of Trump’s voters had their way, we still wouldn’t be."

By November-December there was a theory floating around that this was a first-world virus and that India like most of Asia and Africa was not going to have a second/third wave. Large weddings, festivals, election campaigns everything went on as usual. Social distancing was not possible due to the population and masks were ignored or usually worn under the chin.

Leaders at the advice of astrologers actually decided (based on some auspicious configurations of the planets) to advance the Kumbh Mela and allow it to happen this year instead of 2022 when it was actually due to be held. 

They took no lessons from what was happening in Europe/US, made no preparations, gave no warnings. Personally, I kept nagging my old parents in India to not to let their guard down, not to go out, to get vaccinated as soon as the vaccine came into the market, to not open the door without putting on a mask. I kept warning them the second wave would come and hit hard. I am grateful that they followed the advice. I wish the Indian government had done the same for the rest of the country."

Same goes for Brazil.
That said, it is not surprising that few resources or concern will go into COVID relief or vaccinations in either country. I am not sure that pouring money into either country would do much good for the public at large, as these corrupt governments would probably siphon off a good deal of it for themselves and their rich friends.

2021-04-24 19:57,Say WHY there is a vaccine shortage. Say that the US refused to lift the export ban on materials needed to make the vaccine. Thousands in India are dying and the West has turned their back. Irresponsible reporting to not to include this
2021-04-24 18:54,"If deaths are undercounted in India, then they’re also undercounted in Russia. And in Brazil, no one has died of Covid at all. It doesn’t even exist there. Just ask Bolsonaro."
2021-04-24 19:47,"It's truly sad to see the statistics surge in India. It is equally disturbing to see covid-cases increase around the world. Each country, territory, island in the whole world must be vaccinated because if we do not get vaccination rate up to 80% or higher, we are going to deal with this virus for some time to come. 

The measles vaccination helped to bring cases down to almost nothing yet anti-vaxxers, unjustly so, blamed the MMR shots causing autism. Wrong. We are facing the same problems with Covid anti-vaxxers and misinformation is spreading faster than the virus itself, including the variants. Like the measles, in order to eradicate it, all countries, territories and islands need vaccines on hand. Hospital workers must give these vaccinations to each and every human being. It's imperative! 

The Biden Administration, including other governmental administrations, must work together to problem solve this issue, NOW. There is no time to wait. We must share mRNA knowledge, stages of making the vaccine with every government, with all leaders, with everyone and explain why the science matters in problem-solving this very important public health crisis globally. The World is Where We Live and all of us must do our part! My heart goes out to everybody who is suffering from this virus and to those families who have lost their loved ones to this virus. We must all defeat this virus! Please, keep wearing your masks and social distance, and keep washing your hands."

2021-04-24 21:39,"I read few comments blaming PM Modi and his efforts but when people (masses) do not follow the mandate of wearing mask or social distancing such as what happened  near river Ganga  - Kumbh Mela where priests come down from the mountains to take a bath once a year and there are people who wants to watch these priests - what can govt  can do? 
Similarly, muslims do not follow the mask mandate and thinks that only women should cover their faces. How many people can be stopped? 
This is similar to Trumpsters who do not want to get get vaccinated. What can Biden admin can do?"
2021-04-24 23:46,"If any of the writers of the article are reading this comment please look into percentages of young children and young adults who are dying of Covid in India. 

I listened to guy who runs a crematorium on a CNN video that was showing the cremation fires from drone footage and he was cracking up with emotion talking about all the dead children. 5 yrs old he said, 10 yrs old, 15 yrs old.

This is the 1st time in the pandemic that I've heard talk like this.....and it is extremely worrying. Has the virus drastically changed and now easily capable of killing young and old???

Let's get reporting on this please, pronto."
2021-04-24 23:16,India's situation was totally avoidable and self inflicted. It is very disheartening to see so much death and suffering. Here in the US we saw the cost of incompetent governance last year during the initial waves of the covid pandemic. Thankfully we got rid of that government. It is time for India to get rid of it's incompetent fascist government.
2021-04-24 21:39,"Incompetence damages any country slowly even in normal times but manages to hide behind the facade of Nationalism. It has been unraveled stark naked by Covid. Unfortunately those who cheered on the hate mongers now face the consequences alongside those who opposed it. Still, those responsible for the loss of so many lives will wash their hands off claiming this was an act of God. Likely they may even manage to cling to power just by dialing up the hate a notch. India's misfortune is there isn't a Biden to take the rudder from a clueless Trump and steer the nation back to normal. Incompetence is truly bipartisan there."

I don’t know about Modi, that man is on his own trip, but subsequent Prime Ministers will surely tilt towards Russia once again. Russia has time and again proved to be a friend in need. And has already promised Sputnik without much thought. Heck, even China has stepped up with its offering, though they always have suspicious fine prints in any of their dealings.
This epidemic will come to an end one day, but US will repent leaving India on the lurch. Indians were just overcoming their suspicion of US and warming up to its goodness. 
By the way, if you think the virus will remain restricted in India alone, you are highly mistaken, the best bet for the world was to let Indians get vaccinated and develop a herd immunity. Nobody is telling you to stop vaccinating people in your country, but you already more vaccines than you need. What now? US is surely losing its moral right to be the world’s guardian. Somebody will step in very, very fast, and you will just watch. Indians are not going to take you seriously any more."

The USA has had the highest deaths in the world, yet no newspaper showed pictures of scores of people being buried. India’s healthcare system and vaccination production is one of the highest in the world, only destroyed by the failure of the centre to coordinate and allocate resources properly. So yes, the Modi government failed us like the Trump and Bolsonaro regime failed USA and Brazil. NOT our healthcare, or our vaccination system. They were just the consequence of an insensitive government."
2021-04-25 1:12,"This is no surprise at all. India’s population is more than thrice and land is one third that of America. Naturally deaths on account of COVID 19 have to be much higher than those officially reported. Sadly it’s a political game for the government concerned.

In America 5,71000 deaths are reported purely due to the pandemic so far. Experts there feel actual deaths have to be 20% more than the figure reported. One can easily imagine the magnitude of deaths in India even considering the fact that India is a tropical country given the fact that lack of individual and collective responsibility is universal throughout the world. Which is a mega mess by itself.

Sadly death of a human being has become a mere statistics. A person’s death in the family for whatever reason creates a huge vacuum cumulatively on kith and kin forever, which none seems to understand. Death of a bread winner amounts to death of families, which is not at all taken into account."

With a population of approx. 1.4 billion people, in which they have an impoverished population that is equal to our own, the potential variants that could come out of India is scary. Sometimes, I feel this virus is forcing humanity to finally realize we are a blue rock flying in space following nuclear furnace. We have no other escape and need to start looking inward and fixing our global problems together."

Had Trump recognized and addressed the problem early, America could have cut its death toll by about an order of magnitude.  Trump and his minions were too busy demogogging and looting the government.

You are now viewing a replay of this scenario on a grander scale.  This is going to end horribly"
2021-04-24 19:11,"As a Chinese, I should say the biggest problem in India is not corruption. It is incompetence. Honestly, when Chinese people talk about India, it is kind of a laughing stock. They said that they wanted to develop Arjun tank at 1972, and they got their tank after 30 years, and it was a toy.  They said they wanted to develop their jets in 1980s, and they got their jets after 30 years, and it was a old model that should be abandoned in 1990s. 

Today's tragedy is not something that would surprise Chineses. We knew that it would come. When Modi announced to lock down the whole country. We had doubted it already. Why India would lock the whole country? Was India really capable of locking down the whole country> If India could use other strategy in the beginning, and focused on pushing people to wear masks and testing (actually not even need that much testing in India), they would have a much better outcome. Instead, they announced to lock down the whole country to show the ""strength"" of Modi, and the outcome is what you can see now."

Please tell your readers the current COVID-19 death count in the USA.


What are the reasons that we’re not increasing our testing and contact tracing to identify early cases?

Are we not treating new infections of vulnerable people with monoclonal antibodies because it’s too expensive, requires infusion therapy, and is in short supply?

Not to seem macabre or insensitive, but what will be the unintended consequences (I.e. much lower future national medical expenses?) of the pandemic killing off a large number of our elderly and medically vulnerable? 

The new management hasn’t changed the overriding strategy of shots in arms ASAP (AKA Trump’s Operation Warp Speed).

The lesson learned is that no matter the challenge, American know-how will ultimately triumph over any adversity despite global and national “sacrifice” and chaotic management: 
Global Warming?

Truth or Truthiness?"

2021-04-25 5:12,India’s politicians have abdicated from their duty to stop the hemorrhaging of thousands of innocent lives lost as Covid infections continue to rise unabated. With a population of more than a billion people the whole world cannot sit by as the contagion spreads uncontrollably.

India is a consumer-driven economy - people need to trade goods and services to pay for bills, there are no KurzArbeit programmes. India poor, whom none of the media has bothered to interview, would die of starvation if not of lack of Oxygen. They absolutely want no lockdowns. If the media were to be believed the infection is confined to New Delhi, Ahmedabad, Bhopal, Mumbai & Indore - all capitals of prominent states. 

India never stood much of a chance - had no option. The only option was to hope for a suspension of Patents, so vaccines could be manufactured by generic pharmas of which there are many in India alone. 

As for India refusing to export vaccines, the nature of global economy is such that unless you are a bully, you need to sell to hope to buy. Hoarding up on vaccines is something the West can afford to do. If India were to do this, what woud happen to tens of African countries that depend on the COVAX programme (which has slowed down because the African poor don't want second-rate blood-clotting vaccines)? Even India's most heartless politicians would struggle to say no.

India's size and demand is such that  the 2 vaccine companies would need capital infusion of INR 4'500 Crores and still TAKE 70 DAYS to ramp up at a level India needs.

For instance, government workers at no-fee cremation or burial sites extracted extra bribes from the families coming with dead bodies. They insisted this was appropriate since they were endangering their lives by constant exposure to the virus. Preferential treatment and discrimination took place in both government and private hospitals. Small businesses hoarded and supplied at black market prices essential medical supplies. And so on.
Corruption in India, once it starts from the top political-bureaucratic level, spreads through the entire system with greater intensity.
The reporters have pointed out negligence and  tampering with the recording of the Corona deaths also in the states where the PM's party is not in the government. 
In a national crisis like this, however, Narendra Modi still appears to be the best bet for India. He commands greater respect and his cabinet works hard with him. 
Modi and his party, the BJP, also has the backing of the largest voluntary organization, the Rashtriya SwayamSevak Sangh. The RSS has risen to such calamities several times in the past.
For a disaster like this, in India, not all blame could be heaped on the government alone. Yes, politicians and bureaucrats are largely corrupt and inefficient; the general public is also extremely non-cooperative and negligent. During and after the first wave of Covid, they weren't following precautionary guidelines. They let the guard down."

Being poor and underdeveloped and being the home to nearly 1/5th of humanity in 1/40 area of world, it is prone to pandemics. No wonder India has become a playground for Covid-19 and the virus is utilizing the bodies of hapless and ignorant Indians as factories to produce more and more potent and dangerous mutants of itself. These new mutants are infecting children and causing fatalities among them. In no time, these mutations can spread across the world, as has been the experience so far, in spite of  travel bans. It is in the interest of rich and developed countries to contain the virus and stop its mutations in India. To start with they can either sell or donate the vaccines deemed inferior for their citizens. Release some raw materials crucial for vaccine production on commercial basis to India, whose exports are, at present,  prohibited by ""Nation First"" declarations. Cheap vaccines produced in India will also be affordable to other poor and underdeveloped nations and in a way you will be helping the other poor nations. Thanks."

They was no reason for crowds to be congregating for the kumbh mela or the election rallies in West Bengal. And there are new variants of the virus. I think we need to recognize that we cannot have global herd immunity if the pandemic is out of control in India. It is so sad. Useless deaths that didn't have to happen just like in the US.

The last seventy years has not bothered about hospitals, PHCs, training nurses. Whatever was created, doctors and nurses left for better pay to the west and middle east.
So pverty causes these problems and it also breeds indiscipline. People dont mask up and dont just care. Then the infectious mutations. Limited means and a big population.

Indian writers like Arundati Roy and before her B.R. Ambedkar, the rival of Ghandi (a passionate supporter of the caste system when speaking Hindi and an opponent when speaking English) assert that the caste system is the engine that drives India.  Covid response bears this out.

The savage monsters of India's ruling Hindu BJP party look at the lower castes as if they were cockroaches, insects, superfluous.  Their response to the plague among the Dalits has ranged from tepid to outright imitation of the Cherokee March of Tears.  They have and will protesct the Brahmins and the upper castes, such as traders.

The onslaught in India against the poorest of the poor has lasted 2500 years, now amplified to the third power by the plague.

In addition to COVID, they have to address the very real problem of how to properly dispose of 100,000 bodies over the span of 2 or 3 weeks. Can they do that - is it even possible in India?

I don't know if they are underreporting deaths and cases. The numbers I have seen over the last year certainly indicate it. I just don't see how they could for the entire country of India

While I empathize with the suffering  India is experiencing, India must get its population growth under control.  It soon will surpass China and become the world's  most populous country, leaving everyone else in the dust.

The enormous density, the  poor and squalid living conditions can very much be attributed overpopulation. Since 1941 the population increased by a factor of 3.54. Average Consumption most likely mushroomed much more, like everywhere else. 

When countries already in a hole dig themselves ever deeper, empathy is tricky if it is enabling more of the same. Tough talk is empathy too, just think of your parents.  Thus, I wished the NYT would have mentioned population dynamics as well."

Low level technocrats drive around the countries in police escorted convoys, like some kind of pasha.

Even then we have not opened our eyes. We don't report the deaths correctly. we manipulate the numbers because we have never lived with truth or a factual world. The Indian mind is entombed in the past myths and beliefs. Only a scientific outlook combined with true religious compassion can save the country. But it may take many more centuries to happen.

Oxygen supply and medicine have reached mumbai today, we assume in next 2 to 3 days, we will be good in terms of oxygen supply in New Delhi too.

In India the leftists or communists are blowing the matter out of control in international media only because they hate the ruling Right wing government.
I feel astonished that just because you hate the ruling Government how can you tarnish the Image of your motherland.

I think I read today that since the inception of covid USA had more than 5 lacs people dead and India has 1.86 lacs. Which is a huge difference.
India had asked the raw material for vaccine from USA but the Govt of USA refused to give it to us., 
I remember India had given medicine to USA last year when US president requested for the same. Apart from that we have supplied vaccine to many small countries in the world.
we have a strong Government and in 20 days we will be fine, to fight this wave.

That is how former VA Dr John English MD concluded

I was diagnosed with MECFS in 1991. 

Some of the best physicians in Canada advised against  
powerful painkillers. processed food, hydrogenated oils, and antibiotics.

They recommended essential fatty acid therapy,
(50 ml flax oil/day) fresh fruits and vegetables, extra

But it’s been a long post-COVID recovery. His family is also feeling the impact emotionally and financially. My friend is thankful he’s alive. He’s a mentally and spiritually strong individual. 
As a nation, we dropped the ball. 
In this crisis, the government failed millions of people at all levels, misinformation ran rampant from the White House down to the local city halls, and too many of us ignored personal responsibility and instead took some healthy skepticism to a whole new level falling for conspiracy theories, disinformation/misinformation, and political demagoguery and manipulation. 
As a consequence, our freedom, economy, public health might suffer for a long time, and I’m afraid many more people could die unnecessarily, including new and old COVID patients. 
May this crisis help awaken the strength of the American people and humanity. 
We must take a hard look in the mirror, acknowledge our mistakes, commit to improve ourselves and realize that we all are interconnected, interdependent and together in this crisis.

Thank you, NYT, once again for a Long Haul article that articulates  four or seven or 14 of the facts of my life with M.E./CFS. Thank you, Dr. Mylonakis, and the other doctors in this piece who are  willing to be “shocked” and “amazed.” 
Most doctors  lack your honesty, compassion and intellectual curiosity. The implacable healthcare system talks “integrative” but walks “silo.” Please teach your colleagues, those who refuse even to see us, we paradigm-shattering Pizza Orderers who stand (prostrate) right in front of them.

The last time I went to a grocery store, in 2017, I found myself, after 10 minutes of trying to shop, slumped against a wall near the produce counter; sliding down it; lying prostrate on the floor. Unable, once again, to explain my dilemma to the shoppers gathering round because my lip and tongue and jaw muscles were too weak to form words. 
The Pizza Eaters Conundrum dictates that you’re not only unable to grocery shop, or trudge from silo to silo, but unable  to work for a living, or battle the “safety-net” bureaucracy for Food Stamps—or afford to order pizza.

My sense of smell is returning but erratic, my energy level patterns seem to be changing positively after the first vaccine though I have no idea if they're related.

He recently went to the doctor to check his heart as we were worried about myocarditis and his doctor ran blood tests--looks like he has hyperthyroidism.  When we looked at symptoms of hyperthyroidism, he checks off 10/12, including the racing heart, inability to regain the weight and fatigue, among others.  They're now running more tests to confirm this diagnosis.  Thyroid issues run in his family but I read that a virus can also kick off Grave's disease, which causes hyperthyroidism, so I wonder if COVID really got it going.

2021-04-23 11:13,"Speaking as a physician and taking in all I know about this as a radiation oncologist, have read and observed, the mechanism behind the long hauler syndrome that would make most sense to me is that COVID causes microscopic to macroscopic strokes/infarcts randomly but most often at the point of entry like the nose or lung.  The infarcts that are microscopic are big enough to knock out nerves but too small, by definition, to be seen on a any radiographic study.  Some infarcts however will be big enough to see. I would suggest researchers look back for a population of long hauler patients who had CT scans and brain MRI before and after COVID for evidence of multiple sites of ischemia that weren't present before."

Coordinated worldwide international cooperation at the clinical level as well as in research and vaccine production, along with excellent journalism quickly brought the planet up to speed. Development of a variety of exceptionally effective practices, methods, and, especially, vaccines, along with generous cooperation between medical and scientific authorities around the planet Earth was a unique event in History.

The only shortcoming was the failure of the United States of America to competently lead the world at the political and social level. The Administration of the previous guy, along with his worse than incompetent best and brightest republican hacks led to half a million deaths before they were pushed aside by the present Administration. The previous guy’s rants and thoughtless, if not deliberate, ravings encouraged almost half the population to ignore and reject all the good work and guidance of Science and Medicine. Hopefully, President Biden’s leadership will guide us through whatever this pandemic disease has in store for us over the next few years, and will provide proactive measures towards preparation and response for coming pandemics. Because of human overpopulation and human caused Global Warming, the planet Earth is most likely heading into the Age of Pandemics.

This Pandemic has been socially revelatory and scientifically without precedent. Humans have never before had the capability to overcome and potentially subdue a Pandemic of this severity and breadth.
Never.

With no disrespect to the individual actual scientists, our species has accomplished feats that even a decade or so ago would not have been possible due to the absence of knowledge and technology that has been developed in the past decade alone.

The transformational approach to rapid vaccine development with independent initiatives presenting varying viable vaccines from which to select based on health profiles, etc. and availability with access is nothing short of astoundingly revolutionary. Humans now have the capability to isolate, identify, characterize, and replicate pathogens for the purpose of vaccine development in days to weeks, not years to decades.

This science holds hope for COVID long haulers. While it is at no cost of suffering to me to plea patience, the long haulers have many skilled scientists of all types working to find them relief and recuperation. And you have millions willing to assist if we knew how and where. Even those of us who were never infected are changed by this virus’ human impacts at a personal level."

They were also at greater risk of mental health problems, including anxiety and sleep disorders.”  

How much of this can be attributed to forced lockdowns? Patients were prevented from seeking medical care for a long period of time and many now are reluctant to venture into a hospital or doctors office or dental office. This has allowed heart disease, mental conditions, cancer, chronic illness to go unchecked so of course there will be deaths. Let’s not forget domestic violence either. We now know that lockdowns haven’t stopped the virus or changed how many people get it—-shutting down and the fear that it caused is the cause of excess deaths."
2021-04-23 15:35,"As sobering as this data is, it also emphasizes the necessity of collecting of more detailed information about the study cohort before drawing conclusions, e.g. cause of death and the wide range of physical and psychological pre-existing co-morbidities.

I sometimes work with weight loss programs or people who want to ""get off meat and cheese,"" as their MD advised then for multiple reasons.  Even integrated care with cancer patients (survivors as it were) finds that people feel better and do better if they have a good lifestyle that suits their body and social needs.  Altho long term covid symptoms are depressing and people may feel hopeless about it, there is always hope of living well, or better by adapting in ways that promote health of mind body and soul or as we call it being conscious sometimes.  Of ourselves, but also routinely of others and of the wildlife around us, a beautiful sunset, or early morning walk ....and a walk is a walk, even if it is around the yard.  I always aim at 35 minutes of walk every day, which certainly doesn't mean it can't be 20 minutes, or 5 minutes out around the flower gardens in the condos.  Viral conditions can linger ... but good to plan so that the bit of energy a person might have in any day is used well.  I sometimes  make a cell phone call to a buddy on my outdoor break, or sit on the steps and read in the sun having coffee.  Naps might be natural to a lot of us too, not to be feared."

I hope people wake up to the incompetence of the Modi government in creating any type of real economic growth.

With most festivals there was at least talk of reducing the size of the celebrations but not with elections. Also, the Kumbh Mela went forward which is a shame (speculating that stopping that may have impacted votes by altering public sentiment). There has been talk that a double mutant variant has been difficult to contain, though there was an excellent chance to contain the virus by moving more swiftly with vaccinations and approvals. India produces the largest amount of vaccines but the implementation was slow/lethargic likely due to complacency earlier this year with low transmission rates. Hindsight is 20-20, but this is basic governance (even President Trump realized that). It breaks my heart to see people suffer, especially when this second wave was largely avoidable."
2021-04-16 13:34,"India's record of economic growth till 2020 hovered around 5%, which is a good result most countries would die for.  India was firmly making progress for its mass population.

Still, draconian COVID restrictions never made sense in the Indian context.  The country population is too poor to luxuriate, sit around and get checks like much of the USA did last year and this.  Instead, the suspension of economic activity will take a deep, real toll on the people.  Being absolutist about COVID restrictions is not a simple calculation.  

India is being asked to walk an impossible line here.  Continued economic shutdown has as many terrible human costs as it does benefits.  Economic shutdown means human life shutdown."

Except for China, of course.

Globalization has been rather good to the Communist Party of China, and the Chinese people.

In other words, everything that economists and politicians told us about globalization for the past 30 years has been catastrophically wrong.

And if this dynamic in India and other developing countries is not reversed, and the West continues its decline, it will lead to a cataclysm."

Yes it does and  India is now paying the price for their imperialism and collusion with colonial powers. India was not looted, it lost out when it joined European colonial powers but couldn't continue competing. 

Since we want to talk about history then look at the history of the East Indian Slave which lasted longer than the pacific Slave trade and was highly financed by the rich of India. 

You know which group didn't benefit from the rise of the middle class? Groups like the Siddhi who are the African  remnants of India playing colonial power and slave trader. They are the most marginalized groups in India to this day.

Again, India was not looted. It lost out because it couldn't continue playing hardball with the other colonial powers and Modi is trying to return India to that status which is why inequality is growing. 

I'm sure this won't be posted because India's imperialistic slave trading history is hidden to portray them as some poor country that is the victim of European colonialism."

Again eating vegetarian food is not a downfall or shame. The writers of this article should grow up in their thinking. I never ate meat, what's wrong with that? The meat industry is portraying 'meat-eating' a symbol of prosperity. Shame on that.

Tuberculosis, which like COVID is spread by respiratory droplets, kills 2M per year every year, with 10M new infections, and it has been doing so since the dawn of time. Robert Koch, who discovered the TB bacillus, noted TB was responsible for the deaths of one in seven humans over the millennia. Malaria and HIV kill ONLY 600,000 per year, every year. After COVID19 abates, TB and malaria and HIV will still plague humanity, and mostly the poor and infirm amongst us. For TB and malaria and HIV we still don’t have effective vaccines, and existing drugs are continually rendered obsolete by the development of pathogen resistance. So these diseases  will continue to plague us.  Hopefully, at the end of the day, people and governments will appreciate that supporting science, scientists, and science education year in and year out is the only way to ensure rapid and effective responses to contagions old and new."

You get what you deserve. If people had taken the epidemic seriously from the start, we would not be in this mess. It might take another two three years to get rid of it.

To the extent that the United States can help the suffering citizens of other countries, we should -- out of common decency and for our self-protection.

You can chatter on all you want about comorbidities and the like but the fact remains many of the 3 million died unnecessarily, as will those that follow them. We got ""lucky"" with Coronavirus in that it is not especially deadly and there are clear ways to stop its spread. The existential threat is that the mis- and especially the dis- are going to continue to kill us, though not at Black Plague numbers. But that's the We Got Lucky part - this time.

I was talking to my HMO (""Krankenkasse"") the other day and asked them when I could expect to get an invitation from them to get vaccinated. The lady on the phone told me point-blank: ""Never. We are not involved in this"". But exactly that invitation by your HMO, based on preexisting conditions, was announced just two month ago by the government!

Pharmacies and doctors can't give shots until they established ""alternative routing"" in their buildings. So, they basically want a ""Covid-19 door"". Madness!

While the latter is true, the former claim that rich countries are hoarding is disingenuous jingoism.  The implications of hoarding are that the vaccines are sitting on the shelf unused.  This is hardly the case to date.  

What is more true is that the rich(er) countries financed and developed vaccines in record time, driving companies to prioritize materials needed for vaccination.  If the fruits of your labor are immediately given away, why work?  And if no one works on developing a vaccine because the effort will do no good for the country doing the work, then where do we end up?

There is a vaccination light at the end of the tunnel but the present virus situation in Michigan and the upper mid- wets and northeast are similar to the beginning of previous surges. Global lockdowns are recurring and presently, it is hard to present in United States, but a lockdown may now be required to prevent another surge."
2021-04-18 4:09,"This went about as well as anyone could have realistically hoped. We have several vaccines in record time. Science has triumphed except that we tend to assign all capability to politicians and folks from Hollywood. At least the average person does.

In examining the effect on different countries, whether in health or economic terms, care must be taken due to the limitations of each country's statistical record collection, statistical standards and political interference or manipulation.

For example, the number of cases and related deaths is materially altered by a country's Covid testing policy. Age adjusted excess deaths per 1,000,000 of population give a more accurate comparison. Mexico appears to have been less badly hit than the USA or Brazil as it is doing limited communal or surveillance testing; however on excess deaths basis it becomes clear that Mexico's excess deaths are proportionally double that of Brazil's: Brazil 28% to 13th March 2021, Mexico 57% to 14th February 2021 (source FT)."

This is indeed the “Anthropocene” epoch due to the lasting impacts human-kind has made on this planet. After extending our reaches so far, it’s inevitable that various pathogens will find us and evolve to adapt to human physiology and spread as well. The relentless growths of our species means it is just a matter of time before new pandemics arise."
2021-04-17 21:15,"I remain skeptical of the covid mortality numbers.  Multiple co-morbidities often prevent one clear cause of death, and their appear to be varying degrees of financial and social incentives for the cause of death to be exclusively covid, thereby distorting what would otherwise be reliable statistics.  Applying the same logic to widespread unipolar rhetoric on the experimental vaccine, creates reasonable doubt around the vaccine for me.  These are the same people who told me that the Vietnam war was a patriotic duty and if I declined to accept that, they would, in accordance with my draft card, incarcerate me for five years or more.  So I went.  I’m not going this time."

I’m well aware that, sadly, there other causes of mortality — cancer, heart disease, hunger, to name a few — but it’s awful to compare deaths. These people were humans leading lives cruelly cut short. My heart goes out to everyone who’s grieving. The sad irony is that we have a remarkable understanding of epidemiology in 2021, and this didn’t have to happen.

There can be no symptoms at all for their communal or imported cases and then a cluster starts. This is despite extensive controls and stay-at-home quarantine for incoming travelers. And they can be talking about just ONE case causing a cluster. Now look at the 100,000s of cases in many countries.

If you carry such as statement with you in your wallet, I am okay with your otherwise highly egoistic and antisocial position.  Let the cards fall where they may.

I don't know what is best, but I am no longer interested in what any government has to say on this matter.  I will wear my mask and take precautions but other than that I want to be left alone.

2021-04-18 2:04,"Those who say Coivd 19 deaths are inflated because they include deaths from other diseases should get acquainted with excess mortality. 

Here's how the Center for Evidence Based Medicine from U  Oxford (3/3/21) explains it:
""The Coronavirus (SARS-nCOV2) has caused a marked increase in deaths across the world but with significant variation between countries. Some of this variation can be accounted for by differences in the way countries attribute the cause of death. This bias can be overcome by comparing excess all-cause deaths, which is a more objective measure. In addition, estimates of excess deaths can help us understand not only deaths that are directly attributed to COVID-19 but also those that result indirectly (collateral loss)""

Here's their data: 
% increase mortality/age adjusted 100,000 population:
Germany 3.3
Canada 6.0
UK, Wales 10.5
USA 12.9
Poland 14.4

Age adjusted means data from every country was projected on an age standardized population. This allows countries with aging populations to be compared to countries with more young people.

A prize to anyone who can explain these differences in excess deaths without involving the virus."

Japan has vaccinated less than 1 percent of its population so far and the glacial pace of the vaccine rollout in the country means that only a very small percentage of the population (probably less 5 percent) will have been vaccinated to get immunity by the time the Olympics start. This is particularly true since two shots are required and it takes another 2-3 weeks after the second shot to develop immunity.

Japan plans to receive close to 100,000 overseas athletes, coaches, staff, organizers and media from more than 200 countries for the Olympics. The Tokyo Olympics organizers have not mandated Covid-19 vaccines as a requirement for them to travel to Japan.

Many countries including Japan are seeing a spike in more contagious and dangerous variants. Infections are soaring in Japan where the government has imposed new emergency measures in many areas including Tokyo and Osaka.

Pandemics generally result from high population density and poor habits that riskily approximate humans and animals.  As long as there are wet markets, for example, we’ll continue to see worldwide SARS viruses.  And wet markets are not the only sources, but a good example.  

The world is overpopulated and humans have bad practices and habits that they don’t want to change.  This isn’t the last virus; almost certainly not the worst or most lethal.  

It may seem heartless to say in the face of all this tragic loss and suffering, but I do see this pandemic as the price we humans pay for how we live with the earth, and each other.

2021-04-18 12:30,"Most of these deaths were avoidable. As several Asian nations together with Australia and New Zealand have shown, the virus can be kept at bay even when it is active elsewhere if controls are strict enough.

What was needed was a blanket ban on non-essential air travel with strictly enforced hotel quarantine, a track and trace phone app which really works in a way that authorities can use to find and isolate those who are at risk, and the preparedness to enforce regulations strongly when necessary. 

Sadly, most Western democracies let personal travel continue far too long (with the explicit backing of the World Health Organisation) listening to the whinings of the travel industry and globalised corporates who have persuaded themselves travel is essential.

Similar whinings from privacy campaigners have left most of the apps available in each country failing to share essential location data with authorities that we have perversely allowed Apple and Google to retain throughout.

Governments (and the WHO) also failed to stockpile sufficient PPE in advance, and failed to be honest about the importance of it when they found themselves without stock.

International travel is the conduit for spreading this disease from country to country. Surely therefore, to prevent what appears to be a never ending cycle of reinfection and importation of new variants; should it not be the case that all countries should adopt the Australia, New Zealand and South Korea models of controlling this virus?

   And, my attitude has changed as well. I and the friends I  associate with have been vaccinated,  the others in this county, virtually  all right-wing, are certain vaccinations are dangerous because they live their lives on Facebook, which continues its traditional role as a dis-information clearing house, and because whatever Trump says still goes, if he ever said it was a hoax, then it still is.
   I no longer care if these people get it. The more the better, it just assures a better outcome for democrats in the next election.

2021-04-30 13:27,"Not trying to be contrarian here (well maybe I am), but overnight camps featuring vaccinated staff present a largely closed environment with almost no mingling with at-risk groups. For kids themselves, the dangers of contracting Covid are similar to that of the flu. “Long Covid” is not that different in kind or frequency from other uncommon sequelae to viral infections, and the post-Covid inflammatory disorder is vanishingly rare. Why would we impose all of these restrictions (which seem like they will inevitably be honored in the breach at sleep away camps)? I’m all for pre-camp testing and swift sequestration of positive campers, but generalized outdoor masking and constant separation seems over-the-top and incompatible with the purpose of going to camp in the first place."
2021-04-30 16:49,"The camp I help run ran quite successfully last year with no incidence of COVID, and we expect this year to be the same (but with fewer restrictions and guidelines). Vaccination is great but was not essential for us last year (by proof of history) and will not be essential for us this year. As described in this article, our registration filled very quickly, and we have a long waiting list, as we did last year. The truth is, enough people care more about their kids' childhood experiences than they do about COVID risk that they want to send their kids to camp."

Because it’s functionally not how CDC recommendations and advisories work. The CDC has a strong bureaucratic bias towards caution and qualifiers. 
The inability of the media (particularly influential outlets like the NY Times), to properly communicate relative risk during this pandemic has led to a collective fear based mania that has gotten away from us like a runaway train. Data from countries across the world makes it clear that children are not at risk of hospitalization or death from covid. I mean “not at risk” the same way I would mean I am not at risk of dying as I drive to work, or my child is not at risk of getting kidnapped on his way to school i.e., it is so unlikely that it doesn’t paralyze me into fearful inaction, but I do take reasonable safety precautions for both.  Now that most of the over 50 cohort (which in my area accounts for 99% of covid deaths) is  vaccinated, there is no rational, data informed reason to restrict summer camps. 232 children (17 or younger) have died of COVID per CDC website. There were 188 reported pediatric flu deaths (17 or younger) in the 2019-2020 flu season.  Summer camp has never been completely ""safe"". For more than a year, we have been hearing nothing but a steady drumbeat of  death counts with little or no  context about  relative risk. This article is more of the same."
2021-04-30 20:34,The rules are probably meant to make parents feel safe to send their kids to camps. But for me it's a turnoff. We'll keep our kids home so they don't have to walk around with a mask outside.
2021-05-01 0:02,"Our daycare was closed from the shutdown in mid-March and all through last summer. We tentatively signed our child up thinking an all-outdoors day camp with children masking might be something we were willing to try (for the sake of our entire families sanity juggling full time at home work and a young child). They didn’t open but did in late-August through the cold northeast winter. Mask protocol, hand washing, cleaning, distancing and group sizes of 10 kids. Not to mention highly diligent families who keep their children at home at the slightest hint of a symptom. Our 4 year old has been tested 5 times for covid... we recently learned he has allergies! Better to be safe than sorry. 

With due diligence it is possible for children to have access to the academic and social development their minds, bodies and souls need. They just need the adults to create the right condition. Can we adults manage this?!"
2021-05-01 1:27,"Children don’t social distance.  Outside activities may work but then there’s transportation, sleeping arrangements, and all those times kids manage to get out of sight of supervision.  

Very soon we should have vaccines approved.  I don’t understand why anyone with the resources available for summer camp would take an unnecessary risk with potentially long term (or even fatal) consequences to their children when we are very close to having much safer options.

We all have social needs that have gone unmet for the last year and a half.  But, our first priority is to survive, right?"

It’s not a hunch, it’s not a theory. There is no controversy about this. If protocols are developed and followed, camps and other institutions can operate safely."

2021-05-02 3:54,"Last year’s Georgia summer camp outbreak is described in the CDC Morbidity & Mortality Weekly Report for July 31. This was a large, long-duration event with 260 staff and trainees preparing on-site for three days after which 360 campers arrived planning to spend a week. Most of the cabins were large, sleeping up to 26 on bunk beds in the same room, a thing that would have scared me even if all the widows had been open. “Attack rates increased with increasing length of time spent at the camp,” says the MMWR.

Covid is still very much around. Life isn’t going to stop anymore on account of it. But I have real doubts that masks and other precautions designed for safeguarding brief contacts are as effective when people are together for days; the virus has much more time to find its way past barriers then. So I’d only recommend group camping to those who are willing to chance a high-risk activity."
2021-05-02 9:23,"Reading about all of the Covid-19 safety protocols planned for campers and staff this summer, my instincts tell me that some camps are going to do it far better than others. And, even for the day camps which do the best jobs at protecting everyone, I do not think that parents of campers will relax very much.

The fresh air, the distancing and the youth of the kids are the best protection. Kids who are dropped and picked up at camp by a family member will probably do better than kids who get packed into buses or vans."
2021-05-02 11:03,"It is going to be okay.  The camp directors I know in Vermont have been planning for this summer for months, based on science.

This article reeks of hypocrisy in the sense that the author seems to only care about the risks of Covid and not the risks from other forms of illness or death. 

I have a better question: Is it safe to not allow your kid to go to camp? If you force your kid to stay home alone and indoors, think about the damage that will do to their mental health (lack of socialization) and physical health (more time being sedentary watching TV or playing video games)."
2021-06-01 18:22,"Children spread covid significantly less than adults, and covid cases are free-falling across the country as adult vaccination rises. It's time for kids to have a normal, restorative summer. 

I have zero qualms about my child attending camp full time. The kids are wearing masks indoors but not outdoors, which I think is completely fine. I don't even think they need the masks indoors anymore - kids under 12 have been  attending school without them in many parts of Europe throughout the pandemic, before anyone was vaccinated.

This probably sounds scary to a lot of times readers, but it will all feel normal soon."

Kids caught the bug at half the rate for working age people (who had the most cases of disease but similarly few deaths), 4.65% vs 9.69% of their group populations. 
Kids survival rates were the best of all groups: Kids survival rate, 99.987% vs Working age, survival rate 99.52%. 
Working age folks: 9.69% of them got sick but not very many died (ergo the genesis of the ""this is only the flu"" myth driving antimasking). Mom and Dad were the carriers, not the kids. 
Above age 50 though, and especially 65, the numbers are really bad. Lamentable, but normal.
As with most pulmonary disease based pandemics in history, older people suffer badly but in the case of COVID, kids came out substantially better. This is triggering studies as to why. 
I don't know that anyone has stats by age group for the 1918 flu pandemic but that one didn't hit kids terribly hard either, but working ages 20-40 suffered disproportionately higher deaths than would have been expected. Unlike COVID."
2021-06-02 13:59,"I think it's important to define safety here. As Emily Oster wrote recently, there are around 5 times the number of kids who drown each summer as get Covid in 16 months. I would read an article about how to make sure my kids don't drown. However, conflating ""safety"" with ""positive cases"" without explanation of why it matters that a kid is positive for Covid (or explanation of why on earth we're testing them), this article is not well thought through and could have used a serious editor before it was was published."

This happened in a crowded room full of adults and kids watching the sadistic event. They did nothing. The Good Samaritan does not exist there. Bystander apathy is 24/7. 110 children have been killed in Japan in judo class. 40 killed in Taiwan judo classes. Hundreds more maimed or are now vegetables with almost all brain functions gone from blows and falls. Why is the NYT afraid to cover this. It is Kitty Genovese again. Or you didn’t know? Sadistic rituals are common in Japanese culture to join a club, get a promotion. Taiwan was a Japanese colony until USA granted freedom. But Taiwan is still very Japanese."

Still the vaccines are not free for all in India. There are long lines in Private and Public hospitals, many people are afraid of catching the virus from the crowds at these hospitals where vaccines are being offered.

This is more  serious than just India. That is not  to diminutize the largest Democracy (by population) on Earth.  It shows that the virus has and can mutate again and that social  requirements, while originally skirted w/o result in Mother India may have  produced confidence, OVER confidence has now wrought cataclysmic events. The US harboring excess from the country that  makes it with 37.6% of Americans now having at least one ''jab"" shows the rest of the world the imperative of patience. I realize that is not easy. Daily leadership to spread good will and common sense is needed here in 24/7 doses. We can beat this if we all accept the situation and deal with it accordingly. I'm not callous, I'm honest; I've lost 106 friends and relatives to this since November 2019. Today over 600K have died on North America. 3.7M  worldwide. this was never a ""hoax"" and it will ""never magically disappear""--TFG  who said that was simply incompetent to deal with it, and it makes sense that a vaccine ordered up ""warp speed""  w/o clinical trials would be suspect. If India falls, we all fall."

Note that a new census is supposed to occur in May, 2021, but who knows in light of the current situation. An estimate for 2020 gives a population total of 1.4 Billion. 
The population pressures on all aspects of Indian infrastructure, including its health care, are massive even as economic growth and development occur. Then, along comes the pandemic.

Not to diminish India's travail, still, it shouldn't deflect us from conclusions about how badly this advanced country has done. On a per capita basis, our performance is about on a par with Brazil. This should make us rethink our system of health care, but it hasn't, not even from the Democratic side. We are still in the grip of illusions."

The estimate from the Center for Disease Dynamics (see Ramanan Laxminarayan) is that the real number of cases that are positive is 30-fold and the estimated number of people infected in India so far is 400 M.  There are still a billion hosts left.  So the death toll if counted right (only one in five deaths in India is given a reason) would be 3-5 M.  It is grim -- India needs help and also needs to contain it within its borders.  Otherwise we are back to Dec 2019.  I wish everyone the best.

The effectiveness of central government may depend on the local and state government to actually carry out the order. Mr. Modi, rose from  a state government leader to become a national figure, knows this very well. 

The current crisis just reflects the reality that every state government is for herself.  Until Mr. Modi can really impartially treat every states the same, India will continue its crisis management until enough vaccines and medical supply for all."

I caught the virus in January 2020 when India had not even imagined a thing about covid. I might be one of the early, isolated cases but that time no one at the hospital would attribute my oxygen levels to covid. There is a fear to get it again, I was nearly dead when I got it. Left and right, people are falling, dying devoid of hospital beds or healthcare. I wish I had the money to move to US  someday because this country has failed us.

2021-04-30 19:27,"While there is no doubt that the government of India in general, and PM Narendra Modi in particular are guilty of neglecting the second COVID wave in India until it became the catastrophe that it is now, there is one aspect which is not being reported well in the American media. It is that the vaccinations in India faced a roadblock after initial roll out, because of shortage of essential raw materials that the Indian vaccine makers import from the US. The Biden administration, in February, placed an embargo on the export of vaccine related raw materials, even though there were no shortages in the US. A few weeks back, Mr Poonawalla, whose firm Serum Institute of India manufactures the AstraZeneca vaccine, was literally begging Biden on Twitter to lift the embargo. The response from the Biden administration at that time was a plain lie - that the US did not impose any embargo. It is only when the second COVID wave became a tsunami in India, and after facing lot of criticism for a lack of response, did the Biden administration relent and lift the embargo. No, I am not blaming the US for the second COVID wave in India. That would be foolish. I am only mentioning a fact that is under-reported/not reported in US mainstream media."
2021-04-30 20:09,Before the vaccine era  people suffered through  pandemics  as  diseases decimated populations and those who survived had some sort of immunity.  Vaccines short cutted this process by giving immunity without suffering the dire consequences. But for many in India they live in a world where modern medicine  barely touches tem  and herd immunity is found after vast suffering.  India needs a huge effort to provide every thing needed to save as many people as possible.  But will even that be enough to touch 1.3  billion people with the means to head off this crisis?  It is not all just in the hands of God.  We who have the means must make the effort  remembering our own suffering as we weather and have weathered this horrible disease.
2021-04-30 20:42,"India started off stating that they had it under control, it was not rampaging as in Italy, Spain, and France.  That's when the virus built up the momentum/travelled resulting in what is happening now.  The same scenario can be seen in the US.  Six to eight weeks of denial by Trump gave the virus momentum.  Then when the US finally jumped on it, the initial surge was dampened but relaxing restrictions for some perverse Constitutional reasons couple with the momentum produced three to four thousand deaths a day months later.  The bottom line is that those societies that took it seriously, jumped on it early, and stayed the serious jumping on it are doing far better than those societies that failed.  The US under Trump failed and still leads the world in deaths.  Looking now at India is not much different from looking at the US not that long ago."
2021-04-30 21:08,"We should figure out as soon as possible the true role of variants. If this rise is due to govt incompetence, then it is of course criminal, but we know how to defeat it. If the variants are behind this, we are essentially beginning a new pandemic. Not good news for anyone."

2021-04-30 21:49,"I had always looked at India with a mixture of horror and admiration. I admire that the country has been able to maintain a stable democracy despite all the headwinds but the 1.4 b population leaves little margin for error in all aspects of economic development, agriculture, health care, you name it.

But why did the US wait so long to impose travel restrictions from India? And before that, the US failed to restrict travel from the EU and initially from China. Part of the reason for the variants and how out if control this pandemic has been is due to the lack of travel regulations and restrictions from airlines to  cruise ships to people walking across the border. We are essentially importing new cases and variants."

The virus is everywhere. it is difficult even to schedule vaccinations for elderly people (relatives). Hospitals don't answer the phone and are running on empty. People dying in parking lots. Even dentists (like my wife's nephew) are on covid duty in Delhi. The severe crowding doesn't help at all but social distancing is really not possible in most Indian cities unless one is wealthy and even then, most have help that come and go. Modi has turned out to be completely incompetent but I doubt any other government could have done better. Too many people, not enough resources or vaccines. It is a disaster. The only hope is for vaccinations to be sped up but there are too many people. I fear this is going to take a lot of lives before things get better."

It’s already here; the Indian variants.  They must be here.  They cannot not be here.  They’re just quietly percolating away in the background competing between themselves for reproductive success. The ones that win their intramural contest will defeat our present vaccination measures.  Moderna?  Pfizer?  And then we’ll be burying the newly dead in public parks, or burning corpses in the streets; like they do in Delhi, and New Delhi.

So much misplaced hope will be dashed by such unbelievable incompetence and gross governmental negligence.  Trump’s.  Biden will end up presiding over an American cenotaph."

It's a shame that the government is not under threat!! Anyway, here is the simple math that would prove why the real COVID-related deaths must be manifolds
India's total populations = 1.35BN
Normal Annual Death Rates per 1,000 = 7.3
Total Annaul Deaths =9.9M (1.35BN x 7.3/1000)
Avg Daily Deaths = 27000 (9.9M / 365)
If Covid related deaths are around 3,000 a day, that equals only 11-12% additional deaths.
If so, why people have to wait three days to cremate? 

The government is managing data like it's done on the economy and other fronts! Sad thing is, people will still elect the same government!!"

2021-04-30 22:25,"This is 100% a political failure and failure of the central government tops this, the hubris of two leaders in particular: PM Modi and Amit Shah.

Festivals and political rallies attracting millions of people, false sense of immunity against COVID and a fawning media. To top that, any state govt of a party other than the BJP or its allies have been undermined and harangued. The COVID response coming from New Delhi is politicized, callous and any criticism of the govt will be quashed.

The numbers being reported are lower than what the true picture is...it is very difficult to get an accurate picture because of the under-reporting.

Speaking to friends back in India, who happen to be supporters of PM Modi, say this COVID- wave is nothing but a media hype. So with this level of wilful ignorance, God-like worship of a political figure and callous disregard for life in general but especially the poor, we are seeing what we are seeing. 

Tragic and heartbreaking."

It will be like the plague.  One-third of us will die, or we'll have to lock down for another couple years and again listen to the infantile wailing of those high-chair Republicans whose greatest moral cause in the world is ""sticking it to the libs"" by infecting us with the coronavirus.

2021-04-30 23:19,"I would like to understand how it is that DiBlasio & Co can find such optimism for a grand re-opening of NYC at the same time that we are hearing such disasterous news from India.
Granted, more people in NYC have been vaccinated, or at least had the first of two shots -- but there is so much unknown about how long the vaccine is effective, and also uncertainty about each new variant that appears. The latest Indian variant has already shown up in Europe. 
So, sure -- no one needs to wear masks: that's the message that falls on willing ears, minus the details and conditions in the CDC guidance. And certainly we would all like to go back to life as we used to know it. But what about all this news? Can't happen here? What to look forward to next fall, after the ""Summer of NYC.""

2021-04-30 23:00,"I agree with some of the other comments that we must stop the flights from India but the science has suggested country limitations don't do much. This was evident in the first wave where we banned flights from China but COVID came from Italy. Essentially choosing India isn't going to stop it. We must have the same measures that Australia, Hong Kong, Taiwan (all places that have controlled COVID) to monitor ALL TRAVEL into the US and make a mandatory 14 day monitored quarantine from anywhere. Even if you are a citizen. You must quarantine. Or else a new variant will put us back at square one and make all the efforts it took to get 100M vaccinated -pointless."

It turns out that all those claims of natural herd immunity in places like urban India was false and that masking and social distance kept the virus at bay in even the most crowded places. It is clear that most of the world is still naive to the COVID-19 virus, and every part of the world that hasn't been widely vaccinated can suffer explosive cases and deaths. We also know that variants are rampant, and it's matter of time that a variant will not only diminish the efficacy of the current vaccines but overcome it. If this happens, we could very easily find ourselves back in March 2020--a dreadful thought. A reasonable approach now is to restrict non-essential international travel and implement quarantine measures from hotspots. At the same time, we need to have greater urgency in producing and administering all approved vaccines. The current forecast of vaccinating all countries by 2025 by the editorial board of New England Journal of Medicine is clearly inviting unmitigated disaster."

If you are a decent human being, you should care about what happens to any other human being, whether it affects you personally or not.

The truth is, if we wanted to, every human on this planet could have a decent life, healthcare, food, and a place to live. 

Scarcity is a lie. Greed is the problem.

Hopefully before the next pandemic we’ll learn that we need to live with less so that others can simply live. 

When we raise everyone up, we all do better: health-wise, morally, and on that famous happiness index."

2021-05-01 1:16,"The rational move is to help the people with the supplies needed to save lives. The vaccinations should be directed to the mostly densely populated communities and it should come from the countries who have surpluses. India is the most populous country on Earth and only one percent of the people have been vaccinated. There will be many new variants as this pandemic moves through this vast population. One of them could be the one for which nobody on Earth has adequate immunity. 

Why it got this bad is because India could not stop it. They could not stop it because they could not slow the spread with social distancing, which besides vaccination is the only way to slow a novel virus pandemic."
2021-05-01 1:39,"You should have mentioned that India’s testing levels have skyrocketed at exactly the time their cases have also. 

And that PCR test cycle thresholds were raised by ICMR from 24 to 35 for Maharashtra state, the area with the most  new cases. This also leads to much higher reported cases but large numbers of them are noninfectious positives bc anything over 25-30 is not infectious. 

I also suspect that India has started following the UK and US technique of allowing only one PCR test probe positive to qualify as an overall test positive result, when it should require two probe positives, out of concern about variants. 

In sum, a large part of the increase in case load is artifact and not indicative of actual change on the ground."

India is hard hit not only because of the variant B.1.1.617 which has emerged from multiple passages of the virus that originated in Wuhan, China from person to person passage as well within a same person but also because there are not as many hospital beds as are needed for such a horrible COVID pandemic.

India handled the first wave of the pandemic with relatively fewer deaths and one of the lowest mortality among the industrialized nations. But the second wave could also be partly due to India not prioritizing its own residents for the vaccines manufactured in India but instead exporting/donating large quantities as this article says. 

India is difficult to govern during normal times and when faced with a challenge of such enormous magnitude, it has become ungovernable. India needs all the help it can get from any and all direction. Everyone and peoples of all countries need a helping hand during their difficult times. India can certainly use as much oxygen as it can get and as many antivirals against COVID it can get. It is appropriate for India to ensure that a larger population receives vaccines."

Add to it the population density, air quality, severe class system, poor hygiene practices, pollution and failure to commit to social distancing and you have the making of a nightmare. No one talks about the class system, if 100 million doses were made available today right now who would get those doses in India? The connected class of people. The arrogance to look down on a class of people in your country is unbelievable and the United States is the villain here? Right. Each time a politician in an area ""anywhere"" talks about how the virus has been beat it comes roaring back after the lockdowns are relaxed. Here in the United States we see the same thing happening. And everyone thinking these RnA vaccines are going to protect you are drinking some funny flavored coolaide. The RnA Vaccines keep you out of the ICU and all it will take is a major mutation to sidestep that protection. A fact that needs to be pushed out is that the pandemic is only half way over if that."

2021-05-01 4:10,"Regardless of which variant is to blame, the bottom line is that a variant is to blame -- because the more the virus is allowed to circulate, the more opportunities it has to mutate;  foolish resistance to wearing masks, plus the easing of restrictions too early, are the culprits. 

I despair of the fact that, roughly 14 months since the seriousness of this virus was made clear by every *responsible* news outlet ( = not Fox et al.), ppl still don't grasp this basic fact. Variants could well render our vaccination efforts significantly less effective, setting us back who knows how many  months and destrpying millions more lives.

As someone who now has kidney problems after having had a mild case of Covid-19 -- and *that* developed despite my extreme caution -- I urge - beg - implore everyone to continue being careful."

And the variants here already with more on the way can more than likely beat the vaccine.

Oh! the nightmare is not getting less.  I fear it's about to get
bleaker and darker.  Isn't India enough proof?

 India thought they were on the upswing and then, the variants arrived and those reveling in reduced precautions are now dying or dead and spreading the deadly virus.

2021-05-01 8:36,"What the report doesn't say is more than what it says. 

It says not even a tenth of the population has been vaccinated. It doesn't say that a tenth is around 140 million people, more than one third the population of the US. In fact, the daily rate of vaccination is between 2.5 to 4.3 million. That's like vaccinating entire Singapore in one day. But India, being so large, will need 300 days to cover 1,400 million people. 

It says people are not getting oxygen. That's true. But it's not because India doesn't make enough oxygen. It's simply because there aren't enough large cryogenic tanks that can be trucked around. 

I could go on an on. There's no denying that India is in trouble. But any criticism must be viewed through the lens of size. This is a very large country where people are free.

The pandemic waves  will come in countries that are mostly unvaccinated, but they will not come in countries where the large majority is vaccinated.  The article notes several infections after vaccination, but should have included if any were significantly symptomatic, hospitalized or died.  My guess is since they didn't, the numbers on that are zero.  When you are vaccinated, we are one step closer to moving past this.  When the US adult population is vaccinated, it will be over.  Surgical masks won't protect you in a crowded airplane (google it, it was studied...8% of passengers, most wearing masks, were infected when someone on the plane had covid).  Indoors, you need to be wearing a fitted respirator.  Conversely, outdoors your risk is minimal.  We have no conclusive data on how much cloth mask stops infections in general buy most likely much, much less than vaccination.  Maybe 20%    Getting vaccinated is the only way.  But once vaccinated, you are wearing the equivalent of not one, not 2, but several dozen high tech maximum filtration masks. You don't need to add one more on your face or keep your distance.

We had cheap seats behind the end zone and toward the end of the game a missed extra point or field goal kick came heading our way. 

There was no netting back in those days to prevent the ball from entering the stands and the ball went straight into the hands of a kid who made a clean catch of it and clearly had possession of it. 

But that was just for a moment because the next thing that happened was half-a-dozen older boys jumped him and started tearing the ball away from him.

Even on the private placement disclosures the SEC now requires companies raising money to disclose how much of the funds being raised are going to be used to pay executives.

It is no secret that the overall profit margins in grocery stores is rather thin, but they obviously took advantage of the chance to raise prices during the pandemic. Customers became willing to pay almost anything to get the items they wanted and they noticed.

If you compare the prices at retail of a shopping list from January 2020 and April 2021 you will see there has been a significant increase in the price of almost everything.

To offset the 5 hours I had to dip into my weekly vacation time that I accumulate. So, I suffer financial hardship due to no fault of my own. And, COLA  has cost me even more. So, that raise I got went down the toilet. It's bad enough we have to endure and suffer the daily requirements this virus has put upon us.

Our economy has been intentionally structured to entice the majority of us to ""invest"" in America. That would be mostly a good thing...if American companies were hiring American workers, were using American materials, and were paying American taxes; if the investments weren't necessary to build companies of such immense size and purchasing power that they can dissuade or just kill off small, local businesses and jobs, and pay their CEOs and fat layer of Administrators salaries that are hyper-inflated if not effectively criminal; if much of our food system wasn't centered around cheap, processed food that is only possible to make because Americans invest in the companies (thus farmers) who make it, but those companies (and farmers) reap the benefits of subsidization, which comes from taxes that you and I pay.

2021-04-29 12:38,"One of the lasting lessons to be learned from the last year or so: The country at the top of the supply chain holds all the cards. Another lesson: Keep in mind the vulnerability of those who are dependent upon potential foes when locating critical production facilities.
Not that I'm a scrooge, but think for a moment what responses we as a country could muster if some globally ambitious power suddenly applied an embargo on --oh I don't know---say diapers until we severed ties with Taiwan.  Horns meet dilemma.
The time has come to put national interests and citizens' security above the bottom line of giga corporations and return the manufacture of basic goods to our home shores. It is also a long-lasting way to reduce the assault on our air caused by the thousands of huge tankers hauling commodities 'round the globe. 
Health over profit---national security over greed.  Goods jobs for our neighbors. How many empty factories are there haunting states that need jobs. 
It is the height of hubris to destroy the planet for a few extra points on the bottom line. C'mon American corporations, do your part in saving the planet and giving your local customers more money in their pockets."

How soon will 320z be cut 30oz

2021-04-29 12:47,"So I noticed this doesn’t cover that grocery stores have had incredibly large profit increases during the pandemic, enough that the courts here in WA called out their crocodile tears. 
And I’ve noticed a lot a talk about passing these costs onto consumers and consumers needing to be fiscally responsible, however, why when they have had increased profits they aren’t being expected to set some of that aside to compensate for influxes in prices as consumers are. 
In addition, as corporations are considered to have the same rights as a private individual in US law, if they are given the same rights as individuals citizens, despite operating in multiple countries and containing multiple persons, shouldn’t they also be given the same expectations as the average individual.
In other words, why should only the consumers, who don’t have any say or power over these prices, be the only ones expected to be fiscally responsible and why should we be the ones to pay for the short sightedness of these companies.
Lest we forget the Suez Canal fiasco, made worse by companies ditching warehouses to act as buffers and relying on stuff being available on demand. Or the increase of self service, online purchases and jobs that will not be coming back. And specifically diapers/childcare and women’s hygiene products will disproportionately effect mothers and women, which is arguably sexist or discriminatory in nature given these are already marginalized groups and products that are gender specific."

In any event, the question as whether prices will decrease once supply and transportation become more stable is, as mentioned, an unknown and, in my opinion, will happen only if competition makes lower prices necessary."

It's time to just stop buying P&G products all together.  We stopped shopping at Costco during the pandemic and reduced Target purchases by 90%.  We gave up Amazon 1.5 years ago and never looked back.

We are tired of being gouged."
2021-04-29 12:51,Inflation or Market Re-Pricing due to demand shifts. I tend think there’s pressure driving prices from both but still very little real inflation.

First, don't upgrade your phone to 5G.  This is one of the overhyped gadgets to use daily.  Second, cut down your TV and movie channel subscriptions. You only need internet connections to keep you up to date on news and sports. Third, start eating more at home and less outside. And fourth, drive an EV or a high gas-mileage car. Gas will be more expensive in the future.

After you've done that, you will enjoy travel and outdoor activities more.  Besides your health will definitely be better."
2021-04-29 12:54,"Anyone who thinks that this will end a cycle of reduced prices doesn’t understand the current Fed.  One prices increase they will stay increased.  The rate of change may go down but the Fed will print enough money to prevent deflation. 

My guess is that these price increases will kick off the expectation for future price increases and the congress cycle of inflation will build.  Soon the economy will stagnant but the inflation will continue."
2021-04-29 12:59,"Mmm. I see reusable diapers and washlets might be growth industries.  Maybe even buy period panty stock.

I usually buy a couple of pairs of shoes to stock up and because there will be at least one pair of shoes I can use and like that are discounted. I bought one pair of shoes to replace the pair getting too worn to function, socks and skipped getting any shorts. I hope manufacturers and retailers don't shoot themselves in the foot trying to make up for any losses some may have experienced (some are pretending to when they didn't) last year. They can create or stop inflation by how they choose to respond to their greed impulses."
2021-04-29 13:22,"I love the rationale that because people have stimulus checks they can now afford price increases in staples. God forbid they catch up a bit, or even get a little ahead!

I grew up in a household where my mother would go ""on strike,"" along with the others moms in the neighborhood if milk went up two cents (we'd get powdered milk) or tuna would go up (pb&j for lunch exclusively). Those are the ones I particularly remember.
There is no longer a consumer backlash. People accept the new prices, pay them, and things continue to go up.

In my household we used to eat cereal for breakfast. Not for many years. When a box of plain, unsugared cereal costs almost five dollars it was time for a change.

Every time I walk into a store things have gotten more expensive, so to say now is the time is nonsense. It's been a price increase creep all along.  Perhaps it is because companies are expanding their product line in hopes of capturing more of the market, but honestly, have you looked at the yogurt aisle lately? We don't need all these products, and a lot of food ends up in the trash. There is so much ""new"" that who notices? 

At some point our society will appreciate that we don't need so many choices. And staples are staples, no matter who makes them."

Prices raised by replacing a product with a smaller version and charging the same price as the larger one. That one is dish soap and seems to be the seller.

Not giving the amount labeled, 7.5oz can containing only 6oz, 12oz containing only 11ish. 
This has been going on a while. They have been falsely raising prices for decades.

Fig cookies, shorter.  Ice cream tub, less ice cream.

I would have a lot more respect if these companies were honest and just said: ""we're raising prices, that's life"".

Yeah, yeah, yeah.

The cost of cereal has been outrageous for YEARS!  Many places already continue to charged $5.00 for a box of cereal. That was LONG BEFORE the pandemic hit.  The box is bigger, but the amount of contents remain the same or even decreases.  In many cases, the amount of cereal continues to shrink while the prices continue to climb.

I am so glad I do not have kids who love and would live on cereal if allowed.  A gallon of milk and two boxes of cereal a week will cost more than what I pay for electricity in a week.  And I don't know about a lot of folks, but my salary has NOT increased in a number of years.

This entire scenario sounds like window dressing to justify HUGE price increases, or as my mother used to say, ""price gouging"".  People are finally getting back on their feet, getting back to work and now - BAM - huge price increases."

There's nothing new here."
2021-04-29 13:55,"This is actually a rather thought-provoking article. Some thoughts:

I can remember when there was a government investigation  dealing with the price of cereal all the way back in 1995. Some wondered how it was (how it is?) that a box of cereal could cost close to 1 hour of work at minimum wage? 

The big question: is there anyone analyzing how companies actually price their products and services? Sure, there are a lot of inputs that go into making stuff or providing services, but how are prices determined. I'm not so sure it's simply ""supply and demand."" For example, do you see prices decrease when certain inputs become less expensive? Those airline prices didn't drop after the price of fuel fell did they?

As for toilet paper hoarding, there was none here in Italy. Why? Almost every home has a bidet."
2021-04-29 13:57,"Prices will affect all of us. Wage and price increases = inflation.

Inflation means raised interest rates, despite what the Fed claims. 

Raised interest rates mean the flood of money going into the stock market and consumer purchases decrease, and less money is available for expansion and maintenance.

That means less tax will be paid, which means Joe Biden's plan to revolutionize America will be done on more borrowed money.

If you are about your country, tell your congressperson that this massive expansion of government spending must be stopped. We're already breaking our grandchildren's backs with debt."

Yes, you will pay through the nose for what you purchase, but you have the opportunity to start your own business and charge the maximum amount that people are willing to pay for your product.  And because of our generous labor laws, you can use loopholes to pay your staff the lowest wage possible and thus make a whopping profit for yourself.

We specialize in beautiful European eyewear from major brands (mostly non-Luxottica, who are a whole mess of price fixing and etc on their own brand, awful), and after the shutdown and we were able to open, we needed to restock and remove discontinued products to put in new.  In optical, you actually buy the frames outright, and exchange for credit.  
   Some of my new pieces for one brand, from Austria, have tripled in cost from the former pieces. Where you could get one rimless frame for $50-90 is now $125-200! And that’s cost! Once you start adding in the mounting and other costs, it’s pushing the frames to almost $600 retail, up from $350-400.  I gasped when I saw what was happening.  I asked why, and was told that the Former Guy’s tariffs and sourcing of titanium and materials were subject to the tariffs.   We’ve been hit with tariff-up charging on everything: eyeglass cases, actual eyewear products, spray cleaner bottles, wipes.   It’s endless.  It’s pathetic, that after the Worlds shutdown, to be hit with all these increased charges, to “make up” for lost revenues.  We were all at home eating their cereals and using their papers: where was the “slowdown” that they are making up for? 
   In our buisness we are now running into lots of back orders on products, the other shoe that’s dropping: no availability.  Which I understand and am more understanding about, since Europe has been hit so hard.  
  It’s been rough."

Executives and upper management have been in their bunker like many of us for a year now. They aren't interacting with actual humans, and are realizing all their expensive office real estate might not be needed. Also, Bitcoin, NFTs and other financial gimmicks are syphonning off investment in their stock, which is hitting their own personal stock options. The Fed can't drop interest rates any more, and QE seems to be a thing of the past, so maybe the C Suite is finally deciding t's time to actually start showing profits the old fashion way to keep their jobs?

If so, that is not good news for the rest of us."

Now the company is simply seize the moment of inflation talk and raise the price instead to leave the rook for future ""product downsizing"". Demand is most shifting from commercial use to home use, not net increasing. Same as stimulus checks, they in most part replace losing wages or go to savings. There will a spike in spending thanks to vaccine, but may not be long lasting."
2021-04-29 14:26,"The price of toilet paper should go up by a factor of 10x.

Everybody from babies to seniors still used those products, pandemic or not. Maybe Kinberly-Clark is just taking this oppportunity to raise prices and it has nothing to do with the pandemic. We'll see when their profit figures come out in the coming quarters. In the meantime, sounds like a time to switch to store brands and generics, and start shopping at discount grocery stores. I'm not eager to hand my consumer dollars over to giant corporations who might be exploitiing the pandemic to raise prices."
2021-04-29 14:53,"Bottom line is that we have all been paying way too little for most of what we use. The true cost of fuel, labor and raw materials is probably better reflected in these new prices, unfortunately.

Consumer choice in the marketplace, right?"
2021-04-29 14:58,"Yes, I thought I remembered this:  ""In most states, price gouging during a time of emergency is considered a violation of unfair or deceptive trade practices law. Most of these laws provide for civil penalties, as enforced by the state attorney general, while some state laws also enforce criminal penalties for price gouging violations.

The definition of ""excessive"" or ""unconscionable"" pricing is generally determined by looking at average prices in the affected area over a given look-back period prior to the emergency, typically six months or so. If prices are 10 or 15 percent higher (some states have different thresholds), then it may be determined that price gouging has occurred.""  

I wonder if General Mills is waiting for the various emergency declarations to lapse...."
2021-04-29 15:01,This is not inflation. It’s speculation.
2021-04-29 15:03,"Price increase of supermarket and club membership stores' products are nothing new. All brand name manufacturing companies have been doing it in a very subtle way for decades and most consumers do not even notice it when it happens. It happens all the time when the contents in a package become less without any notice but the size of the package remains almost the same. Two such examples are- 16 oz / 1 Ib bag of potato chips now contains 9 oz or less at the same price of $1.99 in almost all supermarket stores; I gallon liquid bleach bottles can never be found now; instead everybody offers 3 quarts or less in a smaller container and at the price of a 1 gallon bottle. It seems now this time price hike of consumer products will be a combination of unit price hike and smaller package size as well. Also, at the same time the manufacturers are telling consumers that it helps our environment by reducing the plastic waste and it also helps the consumers' overall health by offering them less to eat junk (potato chips, etc.) and sugary (cereals, sodas, etc.) foods. For paper towels, less and less sheets in the same package is helping the forest to reduce greenhouse gas in the environment.

The quality difference is marginal- or the item is of the exact same quality. Cereal is an area that has just about every option available in generic form for quite a bit cheaper. The National companies you’ve heard about through advertising for decades count on you to buy the name brand through name recognition alone. Is Dial Soap really THAT different than store brand soap? Would you rather have pleated, double thickness toilet paper or save $3 on the same amount? Also, coupons on the store app vary widely from time to time, so watching these and knowing when to stock up (non perishables) really pays off. Also, stores usually have a clearance section for items that have a smashed corner on the box- with the item inside being completely undamaged- for half the price (the items in these sections are hit and miss but worth a glance whenever you go to the store). Don’t be a mindless consumer and just grab the name brand, when a little homework will save you money, especially when price inflation happens."

For non food items consider looking first for those needful items at your local charity shop. Many times we have found better quality items like second hand tools, gently worn sweaters, books, cookery items, at a fraction of the cost of purchasing new. By doing so it also gives us an opportunity to support our local charity thrift shop. In our case the proceeds supports a local animal shelter.

That's what's happening...retailers are getting greedy. Just like corporations got greedy after the Great Recession.

Americans got some stimulus in their pockets and prices went up. I know they're up in my grocery stores, Amazon,Target, Walmart, etc...I've watched them go up. Not just a few percentage points, but 10% or 20%.

Here's the thing though...those folks above made a ton of money during the pandemic; Amazon reigning King of them all. 

So, why are they raising their prices?

I imagine American employers will do the same. To be fair, they didn't do as well as the companies above...but they did get a fair amount of government help.  

Six months from now I will be writing about how employers are now requiring even more from employees, while providing less in terms of advancement opportunities, benefits and pay.

How do I know that? Well, it's not my crystal ball...it is common sense. It is simple observation. It is...history.

It is being awake and aware and taking responsibility to discern accurate information. It is discerning fact from fiction, truth from lies, reality from illusion, and common sense from manipulation..and marketing. 

It is not being married to my smart phone. Our wake up call is here, we got practice during and after the Great Recession. 

Inflation is not some disembodied economic term...it is reality. The only question that remains is...did we learn anything?"
2021-04-29 17:38,"Rather than just focusing on raising prices (which they have), corporations used the pandemic to reduce the quality and quantity of products that customers received.  As an example, look how narrow a roll of toilet paper and paper towels has become.  It is nothing short of corporate greed.  It was the same with ice cream during the financial crisis in 2008.   A half gallon container was cut to 3 pints.  Pints of ice cream were reduced to 14oz.  Only Ben and Jerry’s held to the 16 oz. pint.  Corporations never waste a crisis to increase profits."

2021-04-29 17:57,"I don't know what is so disturbing about price increases due to rising commodity prices.  Prices fluctuate with demand and the cost to produce.  The marketplace determines what the public is willing to pay, it always does.  What the public needs to be aware of, just as corporations pass along commodity price increases, they will do the same with the Biden corporate tax increases.  While they may not appear all at one time, little by little they'll find their way into the price you pay at the store.  Naturally, since the price you pay for the product goes up, so does the amount of tax you pay on it.  Biden is true to his word that your federal income tax rate won't increase, but you will end up paying more for things because corporations aren't going to absorb all the tax burden.  A corporate tax increase is nothing more than a public tax increase in sheep's clothing."

2021-04-29 17:58,I think the analysis fails to account for the price sensitivity of consumers in times of less fiscal stress. Sure the major brands will raise prices as they are premium priced products and are being held to account by shareholders who demand blowout profit reports.

These corporations sure have the hundreds of millions to lobby Congress though, don't they, the way the toilet paper industry did for so long to keep bidets out of our market, as they introduced bathroom wipes.

I don't know if it's the toilet paper and diaper cartels in the US, or if there is just more competition or price regulation here.

Now, a single allegedly Korean-certified “KN-95” mask costs ‘bout $3.00. And a wearer is lucky if it lasts a day. I’m still using the 3M “workshop box” I got 2 years before the pandemic, giving each one time to dry out and kill off most Covid spores, though completing my Pfizer 2-shot treatment on April 8.

We have laws in this country barring emergency and wartime profiteers. Way past time to act.
Neither the price of the parts of a NIOSH mask nor the cost of flour, or, for that matter, the cost of meat or vegetables has increased due to Covid.
It’s time Biden gave the food, fuel and protective gear suppliers a choice: either lower prices back to pre-pandemic levels, or face a national takeover of their facilities.
And a national month-long shutdown of non-necessary businesses  and schools until all virus rates fall. Add No Shots - No Service rules.

It's because the paper companies have been shrinking the width of the roll over and over again for decades while the makers of holders have kept the same specs. Half-gallon juice containers went down to 59 oz, 56 oz, even 52 oz. A pint of Haagen Dazs? Today it's 14 ounces. A quart of Hellman's mayonnaise? Today it's a 30 oz jar.

When the Coronavirus 2 pandemic made a land fall over a year ago, directly from  Wuhan, China on the west coast and from Italy to the east coast of the USA, there were no standardized tests, there was a shortage of protective supplies or ventilators, no vaccines, no antivirals and poor understanding of the complications like clotting, hyperinflammation and long term post COVID effects. From May to Oct. of 2020 all that changed. No shortages of protective equipment, sanitizers, masks, thermometers, ventilators, antivirals were approved for treatment of hospitalized COVID patients. It would be safe for the U.S. to allow Americans and permanent residents of the USA to return from India after screening at entry points for COVID negative individuals and those that are not running higher than normal temperature. Strict quarantine rules should be in place similar to the ones India had at entry points. 

The Indian variant should be preventing from spreading."
2021-05-01 0:36,Glad to see the quick response on travel restrictions.  The US should have done this with China in February 2020.
2021-05-01 0:51,This is only a good decision if the Americans that are allowed to return from India are put into a 14 day quarantine. American simply don’t get that the virus does care about nationality. Another useless effort if not done properly.

2021-05-01 0:50,"We don't need any more of these performative restrictions created in order to make the government look like it is in control of the situation.  This restriction is both overinclusive (because it prohibits travel by Indian nationals who are Covid-negative or vaccinated) and underinclusive (because it still allows travel to and from India by U.S. citizens).  It's logically incoherent.  In terms of stopping spread, this doesn't do anything; this is playing to the gallery."

We will likely need a booster.  Fortunately Biden and also our Governor Newsom, have supplied oxygen and immunizations to this country.  It has been horrible to hear of their suffering, but allowing this variant to spread broadly in other countries will do no one any service."

Now, Dear Government, can you do your part too? Restrict travel from pandemic centers from the beginning, like other countries did a long time ago. Be decisive and nimble. I voted for you and I still would, but I can't say I'm not disappointed."

I have a vivid memory born of shock that the Pompeo State Department chartered flights from Wuhan China immediately after the epidemic onset in which people were flown to military bases here in the states. Following the start of the disease in China and the flights here, the disease became rampant in liberal democrat dominated states and regions. I demand all ingress from India be halted. I warned you. You now assume the liability of allowing flights."

Why not stop all travel from India as step one.  Step two could be a repartition plan, but for the time being if you are an American in India you will remain there until precautions can be made for your return.

This is the political correctness that science does not recognize."
2021-05-01 1:35,"As an Indian immigrant who became an American citizen a few days ago, I highly support this move, even though it will separate me from my parents for a few more months. The behavior of the government has been nothing short of a crime against humanity. All countries have gone through surges. All countries have been caught on the wrong foot of preparation. But India is the only country where the common man is literally being persecuted for conveying the ground reality. America should add a clause to it's aid to the Modi government that it requires transparent accounting of covid data. We must not forget what happened even after India gets through to the other side of this mess and hold the criminally negligent and authoritarian government accountable."

Supervised hotel quarantine has been working in Australia and New Zealand. And it's starting to be more effective in the UK. There are few exceptions that allow people to come here, and any that do must pay for the hotel on arrival. It's not cheap.

When an official says that “You can’t battle a pandemic with travel restrictions,"" I wonder whether this is an opinion born of putting commerce and the travel industry ahead of people's lives."
2021-05-01 1:08,The Biden Administration has muffed this. Everyone else shut down travel to and from India last week. We've been watching India on the news for several weeks now.

2021-05-01 1:25,The Indian government likes to blame the so called “double mutant” for the spread in India. There isn’t any evidence that this variant is any more virulent than other variants out there nor that it is particularly resistant to vaccines. What there is ample evidence for is massive hubris and gross mismanagement by various political parties in the US including by Modi.
2021-05-01 1:47,They should completely and immediately cut off all travel to and from India until India gets it's Covid spread under control.    Waiting for Tuesday could make it too late.

Are there quarantine facilities for these returnees? I am sick and tired of all these lockdowns, I want this to end.
Stop everyone from coming, or keep them in Guantanamo (or somewhere)  bay until they are virus free."

And why not start travel restrictions immediately as other countries did? Why will the restrictions start from next Tuesday? Either these policymakers have no clue or they did not care about the safety of this country. 

When India requested the US and Biden administration to supply medical materials and help two weeks ago, guess what they got? Nothing. Biden said no supplies to India. What a nice reaction from the U.S. China was kind enough to offer help. Now the US pretends that it cares and is  generous to offer medical help to India. Is this late and lame? This just tells you how selfish the U.S. is, but at the same time did not like what China is doing. Typical hypocrite!

Now the question is for India: what were you thinking and doing? allowing people do things without social distance, masks, and caution. This is how stupidity of the government and politicians turned the situation into a disaster. India wants to befriend with both the US and Russia to counter China, think twice before act."

Its taking India to the dark era of 'medieval' period, based on their Hindutva ideology with the sole motive to remain in power Presently, Science, has taken a back seat giving place to religious dogma, mythology and superstitions The banging of thalis, lighting of candles and switching-off of lights for on April 5, 2020, portrays a vivid picture of “pure superstition”, in the first wave

 And now comes the second wave 

Narendra Modi, not only welcomed large crowds as he campaigned for several states going to the polls, but also addressed them without wearing a mask. The Hindu pilgrimage to the Ganges for a cleansing ritual began on March 11. Encouraged by Hindu nationalist leaders, millions attended, making the event a super-spreader The Covid winner was declared, before the match was over, and final whistle was blown On Feb 21, his BJP said in a resolution that it can be said with pride that India had ""defeated Covid "", and this triggered the mayhem.


 Its of concern, that not even 2% has got full vaccination in a country of 1.35 billion 

The pandemic onslaught has being worsened by the unchecked rise of other viruses that existed long before – the viruses of blind faith and its companion, bigotry 

Many more waves may be coming. Its pertinent, change the mind set , get over the ‘medieval’ darkness and reach the path of enlightenment It’s a long fight, no doubt"
2021-05-01 2:27,"We ought to ban the travel to the US of anyone, from any country, that cannot provide documentation of having been fully vaccinated against covid. I would agree that the same should apply to US citizens that want to travel abroad."
2021-05-01 2:30,"Considering what's going on in India, over 300,000 new infections a day, it's surprising that we waited this long to impose a ban on travel from India. Why wait until Tuesday? This needs to go into effect immediately."
2021-05-01 3:11,"""Experts have long recommended against restricting travel during outbreaks, arguing that it is often ineffective and can limit the movements of doctors and other health professionals trying to contain the disease.""

So true. Because it would be impossible to have a travel ban that allowed essential medical personnel to travel."
2021-05-01 3:07,"This article fails to mention the highly successful travel bans imposed by Australia and New Zealand. The death rate per 100,000 people in Australia is only 3.6, versus 175.2 in the US. That is a 98% reduction in the death rate compared to the US. The Australians and the New Zealanders have also succeeded in keeping the lethal UK variant out, while the US has not. Australia ensures that all inbound travelers are placed in quarantine hotels, which are supervised by Australian soldiers and police. Non-residents are banned from entering the country.

The travel restrictions discussed in the article are not broad enough to be effective. In February 2020 restrictions were imposed on travelers from China, but the devastating New York City outbreak in April was the result of infections that jumped from China to Europe to the US. President Trump could have prevented that if he had imposed a general travel ban instead of just focusing on restricting travel from China.

There is clear evidence of a change in virus behavior in parts of India in mid-February. The numbers of cases suddenly started to grow. This newspaper reported a few days ago that Indian doctors are saying that the clinical presentation seems to have altered. There are stories of vaccinated people falling sick, although to some extent that is expected because the vaccines are not 100%. India is probably dealing with a new variant of covid.

A stricter travel ban is needed."

2021-05-01 3:22,"I keep reading that US is going to start ""restricting"" travel from India, but there are no specifics. So do we just assume ""restricting"" means a ban on travel from India? Will all nonstop flights from India to US stop?

I have read that, with collapse of health care system in India, it has become difficult, if not impossible, to get COVID test. Or maybe you can get test, but you can't get results. So am I correct someone who can't get test in India, even Americans or others still eligible to enter US, won't be allowed in without a negative test result?"
2021-05-01 3:44,"If a single infected person is already here than it's already too late isn't it?

We have lost close to 600,000 Americans already. And yet, we see again and again, how that number doesn't even seem to register or matter for far too many people. Mostly ""freedom to infect and possibly kill others"" Trump supporters, but now, it pains me to say, the Biden Administration has become complicit.

This is not a joke. This is a deadly serious affair. And the fact is, without due diligence, those 600,000 deaths could very easily seem like down-payment.

When the pandemic was first announced, some experts predicted a 50% infection rate with ~5% fatality. That would have meant 6,000,000 deaths in this country alone.

It isn't of much use dodging a bullet, if you decide to play Russian Roulette the next day.

The fact is, this ban should have come weeks ago."

2021-05-01 3:46,"While the travel ban is logical, it is ultimately going to be ineffective, as there are so many exemptions. The Indian variants are likely already circulating here. 

Covid will not be eradicated until it is eradicated from the entire planet. It's going to keep going around the world and keep mutating, and thus keep sneaking past vaccines. This is going to be an endless cycle until the world comes together and fights this on a global scale, and not each country for itself. 

This is time for US to step up to the mantle and assume global leadership in doing this. We are well on our way to vaccinating everyone in another two months. We need to allow export of vaccine ingredients, which has been blocked under Defense Production Act. Suspend intellectual property for vaccines for a couple of years until Covid is under control (and yes, all countries to pitch in some amount and compensate Pfizer and Moderna say  $10 billion each, which is peanuts compared to the benefit that will accrue)."

Contrast this with China, the world's largest communist country, which has had the virus under control in record time after being the country, alas, where the plague originated.  I point this out simply to illustrate that a country like India has made such slim progress over the decades in becoming a modern country.  I've visited the country several times and have been aghast at how unsanitary conditions throughout the country are.  The government has done NOTHING - ZERO - to really help the vast multitudes of desperately poor people living within India's borders.  If this is how a democratic country treats it's people, I'll take Communism every day."

""As federal health officials, including Dr. Rochelle P. Walensky, the C.D.C. director, and Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, the government’s top infectious disease expert, discussed the possible move in recent days with White House officials, they emphasized that there was little known about how coronavirus vaccines respond to that variant.""

Are these the same leaders who have been erring on the side of caution with regard to mask wearing outside?  Now in a complete flip-flop they are assuming that the vaccines work just fine until it is PROVEN that the Indian variant is less susceptible?     I see no consistency here and it worries me!

My frustration is compounded by some glaring superficiality in the article.  How about evaluating not just stating the ""guidance the United States has already put in place for international travelers, including a negative test for the virus before traveling and again upon entering the country from India, and they must quarantine if they are not vaccinated""?

Can we trust the validity of the pre-travel documentation at a time when people are desperate to leave?  What does it mean that the travelers ""must quarantine""?  How many people have flown to the US from India in the last few weeks and will travel before Tuesday?  How many will still be allowed to travel after Tuesday?  It is easy to scare readers.  How about informing us better?"
2021-05-01 4:23,"I remember a presidential candidate named Biden last year criticizing Trump's travel bans.  Actually, travel bans made more sense when the virus was not endemic in the U.S.  Now it's senseless (ask Scott Gottlieb) and it's kicking a country when it's down.  But it must be polling well."
2021-05-01 4:45,"Why was the ban not implemented before, y'all ask?

Well, Trump was criticized as xenophobic for the exact same thing by the current President, and it was a hot-button issue during elections.

So doing that before the big address before the congress would have been a big distraction and risk.

In sum nothing to do with science or medical reasons, but political correctness and simply politics."

Bogota is urban, near 8 million people, in severe lockdown. Most people confined to the apartment, including children. You were allowed to take your dog outside a few times a day. Even in the poor neighborhoods, with much worrying and hardship, people were compliant. It was amazing.

Trump and his porous ban of China had the same porosity that Biden is now implementing for the travel ban from India.

It’s a global pandemic that will eventually, if not already, become resistant to the immunity conveyed by the current set of vaccines.

2021-05-01 6:28,"I am not convinced by these border closures. The virus is already in the US and it is not clear at all that the Indian variant is more dangerous than the UK variant that already circulate widely. Anyway if this virus is really more contagious, it will infect a third country and then the US. Totally closing the border (for every country) is unrealistic: it will severely impede international trade to the point of making an economic collapse. Without speaking of illegal border crossing that will happen at some level. Or else you make an exception for ""essential"" travel (like transport of good and merchandise and real professional reason). This is what we do in Europe. But there is so much ""essential"" travel that the measure is rendered completely ineffective. Look the UK variant: most countries have tried to restrict travel with the UK for this reason. But it has not prevented this variant to become dominant in Europe as well as in the US."
2021-05-01 9:04,"This isn’t exactly rocket science, and there is plenty of evidence from NZ and Australia as to how to do it right.  Likewise plenty of evidence from the UK and the US as to what doesn’t work, given the experience of the last year.

- Travel restrictions need to include third countries as well (ie you need to apply the rules to people coming from another country after India (eg ‘connecting’ in the UK, most likely on separate tickets); currently they won’t be affected by these restrictions.

- quarantine has to be mandatory and government supervised, at hotels near the airport of arrival.  Self-quarantine will not be followed; that’s just a fact.

- the rules must apply to citizens and residents as well as all others.  Diseases don’t recognize immigration status.

These simple steps are all it would take.  All measures are imperfect, but the point is to reduce the ingress of infections to a level that can be managed - both by the healthcare system and by public health officials who can track and trace any that slip through."
2021-05-01 11:23,I thought travel was already forbidden but given the porous nature of US travel restrictions any variant that can evade the vaccine will likely evade our slow and disorganized bureaucracy. I guess it’s time to offer our thoughts and prayers.

It is amusing to see the Times dance around that point while giving Biden a pass."
2021-05-01 6:07,I am astonished by the racism in the comments I have seen. The article is about a devastating burden of disease afflicting India. Every comment I have read so far is about closing the borders and not a single comment expressing compassion towards the Indian people or a feeling of global community. This kind of self-centered thinking is why issues like pandemics and climate change are hard to solve - compassion is required and it is in short supply.
2021-05-01 6:52,"Yes, we need to keep Indians from traveling to the US now.  BUT we also need to allow more travellers again from Europe, for instance the UK, where the numbers are lower by far than in the US currently.  I am sick of the lack of fine tuning by the Federal Government on this issue.  American citizens are allowed to come to the US still which is humane, but thanks to the overall bans of so many countries, no airlines want to fly to the US as they are not making profit...making it harder for Americans to come home!  I hope someone there is listening at the State Dept. and CDC."
2021-05-01 10:14,"Meanwhile, Australia has made it illegal for its citizens to return from India. Those who come back can be arrested, according to the BBC. Harsh? Certainly. But Australia has also been extremely successful in halting the virus at its borders. Take note, US government."
2021-05-01 10:17,I wonder what the President’s ratings will be after his two hundred day milestone?
2021-05-01 8:08,"America seems unable to learn.  India not only has huge case numbers but a collection of 'variants', that may be more dangerous.  Continuing to repatriate citizens, under stringent conditions, might be acceptable but general travellers are an insanity.  As a perspective India's positivity rate is close to twenty per cent - that is twenty of every hundred travellers from India are probably positive.

It has just been announced that a fully vaccinated quarantine worker has tested positive and possibly infected others.  Most of the positive cases, in quarantine, come from India, so it is probable that the quarantine worker contracted an Indian variant.

Do not let greed, or political correctness, trump your national safety."

2021-05-01 11:28,"""it is not clear at all that the Indian variant is more dangerous than the UK variant that already circulate widely.""  You realize that is the entire point of the travel restriction because we do not know if a new mutation is the cause of the astonishing infection rates."
2021-05-01 11:31,"Next week? How about ""immediately""? What's the point of a travel ban that isn't immediately effective? That doesn't sound smart at all, it seems very dangerous in fact."
2021-05-01 7:55,Now it’s questionable whether our vaccinations prove effective against the Indian variants. We need to get ahead of these variants and delaying closing down flights from India could prove we’ll lose ground in the fight against COVID-19. Other nations stopped flights from India much sooner to protect their citizens…why didn’t the US take expedient action to protect its citizens like the other countries ? We have to fight Covid on every front and international travel right now except for medical and necessary state officials is just wrong on every level. Get the vaccine and don’t travel internationally.
2021-05-01 10:25,"People need to calm down. I recall several months ago everyone ranting about the UK variant was going to kill the world and we were the evil empire - then Brazil - now India.   The India variant is no doubt here too already - and in many other parts of the world - so jumping up and down about a week here or there for border lock downs is neither her nor there.  It is how we help India deal with the mess they are in - close their own borders - testing, supplies, lock downs etc. (like they did in UK), and putting in place in US requirements for arrivals depending on infection rates of different countries."
2021-05-01 11:14,The travel restriction is an island in a sea of exemptions.
2021-05-01 8:19,"Remember the slow reaction in the first quarter of 2020? That’s what got US got into a huge virus mess. Most of Asia-Pacific has acted quite swiftly on this current situation while US is still discussing??? Here in Singapore we have surges of cases in double digits this week (and we’ve had almost zero cases for months!) involving fully vaccinated individuals in the frontline (we only have Pfizer & Moderna in Singapore) and so new rules were announced to adapt to the evolving situation. I have full trust in the efficiency & organization of the Singapore government as I’d say it’s the best in the world (and I’m an American); yet, also concerned the vaccines may not be strong enough against this new variant and I really don’t want another lockdown. We have been living normal lives since June 2020 & the memories of the lockdown during spring that year are too depressing. When will this end?"
2021-05-01 6:36,"Just ban any entry into US without acceptable vaccination proof and without citizenship or residency - plain and simple. And if allowed in, 14 days in monitored strict quarantine paid for by the traveler. While Indian health system is failing, neither the US nor any other country is equipped to handle the brutal and explosive geometric growth of Covid-19. Prevention is the only way out."
2021-05-01 6:19,"I had the J&J vaccine about two months ago. It wasn’t my first choice and it’s basically the same tech as the AstraZeneca vaccine - the one that doesn’t seem to be working too well against whatever’s circulating in India right now. And I think it’s only a matter of time before that variant arrives here in full force.

So I’m getting a Pfizer dose on Sunday. I had planned to wait for the results from the British study about “mix-and-match” or “Arnold Pharma” combos... but given what’s happening in India right now, I think it’s better for me not to wait."
2021-05-01 10:34,"It is very difficult to enact a national policy in India because of the diversity of population whether it is region, religion, language, ethnicity, caste, social status etc. In spite of all the economic development India has made, the basic mentality of politicians  of dividing the citizens for votes rather than uniting them , and many following faith based policies rather than science based , have contributed to this Covid crisis like a raging wildfire. Unless people take the responsibility of their health in their own hands and take necessary precautions the virus will continue to circulate."
2021-05-01 5:55,"Strange that the US government waited for cases in India to pass 400,000 a day (itself a huge underestimate, as testing is inadequate) before taking this step. Especially as India is tackling a new variant which may be more difficult to contain."
2021-05-01 5:55,"Sad that this has to be done, but postponing it’s effective date will merely result in a rush of people returning from India, only to increase the spread here. Much as Trump’s China travel ban resulted in 40,000 people entering from China between the announcement and implementation, which likely accelerated the transmission of COVID, especially in urban areas served by international air carriers (I.e., New York, Detroit, Seattle, et al ).

Trump was accused of being reactive and xenophobic, Biden is acting too late and too slow."
2021-05-01 8:41,"I recently returned from Italy and can say that the current travel restrictions are hardly effective. No one checked my coronavirus test when I arrived in the US and no one checked if I quarantined or did a subsequent test. Will they start doing that for travelers from India? I doubt it. Finally, I hate to make the Italians look bad, but they didn't even check my ID when I got the test, which would be super easy to forge."
2021-05-01 11:58,"Yeah, open the borders wide. Just what we need for more c19."
2021-05-01 8:58,"U.S. citizens traveling overseas should be treated like astronauts on space walks.  At some point your mission may fail and your lifeline will be cut.  That's part of the bargain when you voluntarily travel overseas during a pandemic, whether by private jet or commercial airline.  

As someone who votes for democratic candidates 90% of the time I think it's time for a national reset on our borders physical and by air.  We need to lock down the Mexican border for a full year as well as the Canadian border.  Not a commerce lockdown mind you."
2021-05-01 11:03,"Of course air travel from India should be suspended until things settle down in India, additionally anyone taking a circuitous route here from that country should be disallowed entry or quarantined. 

Variants become more toxic over time and allowing contamination is an invitation to disaster. Will this be another too little too late farce in the growing list of ignoring simple facts?"
2021-05-01 9:08,"But the good news is we keep our people woke! 
Again too worried about optics."
2021-05-01 11:36,It is a bizarre decision to wait until Tuesday to institute the travel restriction.  Shame on the CDC and the current administration.  Poorly thought.
2021-05-01 5:44,"Indian news outlet WION is still calling SARS-CoV-2 “Wuhan Virus” even today and that’s indicative how things got so bad over there. The US have oppositions to hold Trump responsible and force him to take actions but Indian oppositions to Modi are nearly powerless against his brand of ethnic-religious politics.

The 2nd wave will pass but the damage Modi done to India and Indian politics will be there a long time."
2021-05-01 7:59,"When Trump blocked traveling from China to the USA, it was called 'xenophobia'. Speaker Nancy Pelosi was very outspoken about this.  When Biden does it with India, not a whisper about 'xenophobia'. I wonder why?"
2021-05-01 11:41,"Given what we know about the way this virus and its variants spread, I'm not sure why we are waiting unyil Tuesday."
2021-05-01 4:23,"Ok. India is unfathomably large — population and land mass. COVID is fast; variants have started. South America percolating.

Huge mismatch.

Vaccinations take time to manufacture, require raw materials that are of limited availability and occur in labs that are incredibly complex to set up. In other words — our vaccine production will ramp up to a currently finite level.

So, not likely any way to catch up in foreseeable future.

Meanwhile, here in the United States, folks under 16 yrs old not receiving vaccines, thus becoming a variant target vector. Also anti-vaxxers, some now apparently with fake vaccination proof cards, also an ongoing reservoir.

We may never reach herd immunity in the United States.

COVID may very well be HERE TO STAY. We may have global rolling outbreaks — vs actually eradicating it.

Definite maybe.

If this turns out to be correct, the United States will have an outsized role and responsibility. Globally.

We excel at innovation, research, flexible production, etc, basically anything “outside-the-box”. So many very specific areas.

Heaven help “Joe” and his admin. But they will be up to it.

Reassuring."
2021-05-01 9:36,Should have happened a month ago. Too little too late.
2021-05-01 10:02,"We should've shut down the border with India already. Why? We can't have our health system overwhelmed by those fleeing the chaos in India. Moreover, the Indian variant appears to spread more rapidly than the wild type covid and we risk infecting the unvaccinated in America. However, it is sheer insanity to believe that the Indian, or any other variant, can evade the vaccines in a clinically significant way. This means that if you're vaccinated, especially with an mRNA vaccine, you have a near zero chance of contracting covid, meaning no positive test, either with or without symptoms. If you don't have Covid you can't transmit it to anyone. And if you are one of the tiny number of people who get covid post vaccination, meaning a positive test, your risk of serious illness or death is zero, and asymptomatic and minimally symptomatic people are much, much less likely to spread it to others. So again, we close the borders to not overwhelm our health system with migrants, and so that the unvaccinated in the US won't contract this more contagious form of the disease. But saying that the vaccinated are going to start dying from the Indian variant is fear porn and a scurrilous lie."
2021-05-01 6:45,"How many people is Biden talking about here? A few thousands we can quarantine them in hotels for 2 weeks paid for by the government.

Be a leader and close the borders, develop a strategic COVID-19 national plan and share it with an Oval Office speech. The plan will address and fund putting out hotspots and the highest level testing at the borders. Fund the development of variant vaccines 24x7. This is World War III. Execute accordingly. 
Then develop, with other nations, a strategic international plan.

As your article correctly indicates, thousands (if not millions) of people flew in from Europe and the same will be true from India. New York City has had its own ridiculous travel restrictions which are largely ignored.  I know.  I've been to New York City. But they make politicians look good and ""very serious people"" nod their heads as if they accomplish something. Ditto with lock downs. And probably ditto with masks.  Feel-good science for show."

2021-05-01 12:20,"A story of India didn't have to be. It's really scary what's going on there. Travel ban should have been imposed when we got the first news, along with permanent visa ban for Modi, his Home Minister and the rest who disregarded human toll for the sake of politics and Hindu festival with millions gathering without restrictions."
2021-05-01 12:52,Seems like a very porous “travel ban” that has little chance of preventing the spread of the B.1.617 variant into the U.S. We can only pray that our 3 existing vaccines (of which none is currently deployed in India so there is no real world data) would be somewhat effective against it.
2021-05-01 13:29,"""The India travel restrictions may prove to be as porous as the China order. Beyond Americans and lawful permanent residents, exemptions include students, some academics, journalists, fiancés and immigrants.""

Amazing. This is not a travel ban at all, but a symbolic measure that will have zero effect. India is the world's worst COVID hotspot. We've sacrificed over 570K lives to this pandemic. Biden should have the courage to do what is necessary."
2021-05-01 13:38,"There are approximately 14 ( maybe more) flights everyday from India to USA and each is packed( I heard people are desperate to fly out ASAP so all flights are full with no empty seats). Waiting till Tuesday means countless passengers carrying the virus( asymptomatic or not) entering this country. The virus is most likely already  in major cities and replicating. We have seen that there is a lull period before it all starts. In US,  genomic sequencing is still not being carried out in all Covid positive test results. In India too the mutant virus probably was circulating long before it showed up . It had been  replicating during the ""quiet"" period before its appearance in a  mighty explosive form. Maybe,it's too late for Biden to retract his orders but it will definitely be too late to thwart the entry of virus here."
2021-05-01 13:45,"Darwinism?: 
Not to be macabre nor insensitive nor conspiracy-minded, but thinking of humanity as the Herd; when this pandemic finally burns out, it will have culled/killed millions of the weak, elderly, medically vulnerable from the Herd and significantly reduced our collective medical expenses for the next several years, thus strengthening the Herd. Not to mention the boost for the biotech sector and possibly adding political juice to pushing through experimental trials and testing approvals. Consequences...?!"

2021-05-01 12:57,"My takeaway from this....if it’s not here already, the Indian variant will soon be coming to a neighborhood near you in America,  The travel restrictions are too little, too late.  I am a Democrat but I can’t help feel this is all for show: Pandemic Protection Theatre."
2021-05-01 12:58,"The recent humanitarian crisis caused by the dramatic rise in COVID cases and deaths in India could be attributed directly to the dereliction of duty by Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi. As a Prime Minister, his first and foremost duty is to protect the citizens of his country from any calamity. On that count, he has failed miserably. While the infection cases have been rising steadily each day, Modi has allowed his party to conduct political rallies and campaigning and religious ceremonies with utter disregard for the pandemic crisis at hand. Despite being the largest producer of vaccines, his administration has failed to vaccinate the population in a timely fashion. To cover up the mishandling of the crisis and the rising criticism against his government, Modi has tried to control social media as best he can. He doesn't want the people to see anti-Modi tweets on Twitter. 

The extreme devastation that has caused well over 200 000 deaths with 300,000 cases per day could make India surpass the American death toll of over 500 000 deaths in a very short time. Since Modi has failed miserably in handling this crisis, there is no justification for him to stay in power for much longer. He should be removed from office through impeachment or any other means allowed by the Indian Constitution. The out-of-control devastation is proof enough that Modi and his government are incapable of handling the COVID crisis effectively anytime soon."
2021-05-01 14:30,"Reading these stories about what’s currently taking place in India with respect to the pandemic is truly heartbreaking. I think about current and former colleagues, many of whom I consider friends, who originally hail from India and currently reside here in the US, who still have relatives back home, possibly at risk of being infected, or who are already infected, struggling to gain access to much-needed resources to stay alive.  

While I do believe it prudent to impose travel restrictions, I’m under no illusions that such restrictions will be a panacea in terms of protecting us.  More than likely, whatever variant(s) circulating in India that are contributing to the crisis there is/are already here.  We imposed travel restrictions the spring of last year, which had minimal impact on the numbers of infected, hospitalized, and dead here.  The better solution would be to push as much aid as possible, not only to India, but to other parts of the globe who are facing challenges battling this pandemic (e.g. Brazil, countries in Equatorial Africa, etc.).

To the degree we have serious, massive, outbreaks of SARS-CoV-2 anywhere in the world, I fear this virus is going to stick around for a very long time.  Many of us may feel as is we’re finished with this virus.  However, this virus ain’t finished with us.  Speaking for myself, I know I won’t be letting down my guard anytime soon, regardless of vaccination status."
2021-05-01 14:54,"Studies done on travel restrictions have shown that they are rarely effective in stopping virus transmission. Even if authorities on both sides are fully competent and equipped to implement such restrictions, by the time the variant is detected it has already been circulating and has likely already crossed borders (the Indian variant has been detected in Detroit and Memphis). The most effective way to stop a virus is locally by testing, vaccinating, and effective preventive and social distancing measures. 

What we have instead is a densely populated country of 1.3B people with an effectively zero vaccination rate and whose government had taken their eyes off the road weeks ago. Guess what's going to happen?"
2021-05-01 15:50,"Last year when President Trump banned travel from Europe and China, I didn't see any calls from anywhere asking for US citizens or permanent residents to be stopped from returning. Indeed I saw a lot of comments condemning the bans themselves. 

Now I see most of comments asking for complete travel bans including US citizens and permanent residents and their families. I find it somewhat difficult to believe that race has nothing to do with these demands. 

I am however willing to give the benefit of the doubt, and also I believe India will be over the peak sooner or later, but it will be very interesting to see if will the same demands will be made for travelers (and migrants at the Mexico border) from Europe or South and Central America or Africa should cases begin to rise there.."
2021-05-01 17:57,"We do not yet know whether vaccines work against the Indian variant.  If they do, the current policy seems to be a reasonable compromise between the Australian policy of not even allowing citizens to return from a trip, and doing nothing.  If, on the other hand, vaccines do not work against this variant, then we are back at square one and the Australian policy might be the better alternative."
2021-05-01 14:38,"It is already too late. The Indian variant has been identified in Michigan.

2021-05-01 15:29,"A travel ban is only effective if it is 100%.   I apologize to citizens, fiances, and students, but COVID in any variant does not care about your passport, social or education status.   

What is the purpose of the travel ban?  To prevent introduction of any already recognized killer variants.  

Therefore, why would the designers of this ban include features  such as myriad exceptions that set the ban up for failure?  There are simply some decisions that cannot be political compromises.    That is not the purpose for making the decision!  If it is ""do something, but don't offend anyone"", then it's token and useless.

Clarity on the purpose of any action always helps."
2021-05-01 15:37,Some of us are getting a bit worried over here in the UK. Restrictions are about to be eased but infection rates are still quite high in places. The Indian B.1.1.7 variant was detected in the UK in March when 17 people were found to be infected with it. In April about 170 people were found to be infected with it. That is a substantial increase considering we are supposed to be in lockdown. I dread to think what the spread will be when the partying starts again in a few days. I'm not happy.
2021-05-01 14:12,"With woefully inadequate genetic sequencing and clinical trials of the efficacy of existing vaccines against the vicious “double mutation” now prevalent in India, and with an inability to contain transcontinental spread, flight bans notwithstanding, expect another serious surge of infections and deaths in the US.  In fact the double mutation seems to have easily evaded the AZ vaccine in Delhi so I wouldn’t be surprised if mRNA vaccines also struggle to combat new infections from vicious new variants that incubate in countries with inadequate healthcare and/or trumpian political leadership.

Biden and the CDC stumbled by loosening restrictions and taking a victory lap without addressing this potential new viral tsunami from overseas. They should be communicating in parallel about possible new infections around corner. 

As bad as 2020 was, covid wise, 2021 is shaping to be even worse on a global scale.  Until we globally achieve herd immunity - including Asia, Africa and Central/South America - we will inevitably keep playing whack-a-mole."

2021-04-27 11:17,"Growing up I had family members and neighbors  who worked in the pharmaceutical companies. It was one of the major industries in NJ and they were good paying jobs.  They got those jobs with various backgrounds from being high school graduates who received on the job training to being college graduates with degrees in the field or  also being trained for  specific needs. Not only did the companies meet the needs of the nation and helped in successful vaccination rollouts but they helped with successful vaccination rollouts around the world. 

Over the years I have seen those jobs go overseas and the few remaining here predominantly given to visa workers. That is how India became the ""pharmacy to the world"". So we gave them our manufacturing and jobs , including in pharmaceuticals, and still we are expected to give them more? There are even calls to release patent information so they can continue being the ""pharmacy to the world"" without any input or work on their part. 

All I have heard for the last few decades are claims these countries and their citizens are so much smarter and hard working than Americans and that's why they have the jobs or need to be brought here on visas. No mention of their working for cheap wages. Well this pandemic has exposed a lot of falsehoods and this is one of them. The lies and falsehoods surrounding globalism are falling like dominoes and now costing lives."
2021-04-27 11:48,Haven't those Astra-Zeneca doses been sitting around for months now?  I remember reading they were in the Times quite a long time ago.  What is taking the FDA so long?  Get that stuff our of here!
2021-04-27 11:26,When will these vaccines actually be sent?  The pace of the Biden Administration seems much slower than the Trump Administration.
2021-04-27 11:43,"If other countries desperately need a vaccine that the US hasn’t approved and is keeping stockpiles of “just in case”, if true I am deeply disappointed in the Biden administration and the moral fabric of a country that dismissed the virus for a year and likely contributed to the global severity of it."
2021-04-27 11:44,Imagine if the world spent just 10% less on the military and instead directed those monies towards medical/basic science research. Imagine . . .
2021-04-27 11:47,"I watched Part 1 of ""Frontline The Virus That Shook The World""   last night. Excellent production, devastating stuff especially about the impact in third world countries. Another reason to want to see ""the other guy"" locked up forever. While dropping out of WHO did not create all this horror it surely did not help having the richest country in the world turn its back on any international efforts to mitigate the extent of the nightmare."
2021-04-27 11:40,"The USA HAD the reputation around the world, as being, doing & sending the best they could. As a USian traveling & living around the world with my family, growing up in the 60s & 70s, this was my observation. So we SHOULD send what we can. When they are safe, we are ALL safe. I only hope what we send is viable. In later years I've observed how people would send their old stuff, like old books, especially old textbooks, to the 3rd world. This was NOT helpful. Just because they are the 3rd world doesn't mean it is useful to send outdated or defective products or information. Will we be trusted to do & send our best anymore?"
2021-04-27 11:57,"Yes, the aid is just a drop in the bucket when compared to the need, but we have to start somewhere.   

This problem isn't going away anytime soon, but we have to keep working at it--even if it is one drop at a time."
2021-04-27 11:58,"Sending the vaccines that haven't been approved in the US makes a lot of sense, but not just to India. 
India is so massive, I doubt any aid we send is going to be more than a drop in the bucket. 

Every country needs these vaccines. India is a mess because Modi acted like tRump, having large campaign rallies and huge festivals.  Other countries have been fighting the virus, and they should not be shut out of getting vaccines just because India has an incompetent leader."
2021-04-27 11:09,The United States of America is like a rich man with a guilty conscience?
2021-04-27 12:31,"""None of us are free until all of us are free.""
None of us will be safe until we are all safe.  It is so obvious, the interconnection between all countries.  Wars between us may stop when we fight the biggest war of all- to save the planet and the pandemic is only one symptom.
I do understand Biden's dilemma- that doses were made with taxpayer dollars.  I would prefer that the government use my taxes to save people rather than kill them."
2021-04-27 12:38,"I understand that that America doesn't want to ship vaccines that don't meet standards because of political fallout, but it's my understanding that AstraZeneca isn't even offered in the U.S.   Why the delay in shipping it to countries that request it?  Covid does not recognize borders.  Don't be the dog in the manger."
2021-04-27 12:16,"What a difference a year makes. 

The tragedy in India will be tough to contain but the Biden administration is showing a level of competence and compassion that did not exist in the WH last year.

Let’s not loose site as we vote again in 2022 and 2024.

A global pandemic requires a global response. Biden knows that."
2021-04-27 12:07,"What a whitewash of the USA position in regards to helping the world against covid 19.

USA has an absolute export ban on covid vaccines, no difference if the vaccine development was financed by the USA government, privately financed or financed by other countries.

Furthermore, the USA has an absolute export ban on supplies for vaccine production, no check if those supplies are really all needed in the USA.

Part of the Indian problem is, that they had to cut vaccine production because the USA is hoarding the necessary supplies.

So they USA can be said to have actively undercut the effort to vaccinate the world."
2021-04-27 12:43,"So when is AstraZeneca going to be approved for distribution in the US.  They finished their phase 3 trial in the US several weeks ago. It seems approval should be imminent but I haven't heard anything, not like I read about with the other vaccines."
2021-04-27 12:06,"Demand for vaccinations in the US is dropping below supply, so the US should certainly send unneeded supply abroad.  But first, Biden should take more aggressive action to encourage US residents to get vaccinated.

1) He should demand that health insurance companies track vaccinations by their customers, and a date should be set whereby those who have refused vaccination will not have any medical expenses caused by Covid-19 covered under insurance.
2) He should demand that airlines not allow those who have refused vaccination on their planes or lose federal support.

Getting vaccinated is a responsibility to others.  Those who refuse need consequences that encourage people to take personal responsibility for irresponsible choices."
2021-04-27 12:31,"Not only is it our moral responsibility to help others intros GLOBAL pandemic, but we will also beholding ourselves by suppressing the Covid19 virus.

If Republicans refuse to be vaccinated, and I, for one, am sick of trying to lead a brainless horse to water and make it drink, we'll send THEIR vaccine to people who want and need them. MY regret is that feckless, wanton Americans (overwhelmingly Republicans) don't care enough about their fellow countrymen and women to make use of the only rational way to achieve herd immunity and save hundreds of thousands of lives and BILLIONS of dollars and heartbreak."
2021-04-27 13:07,"Sir ,India is in dire straits . At this moment it needs all the help it can get immediately internationally to save lives and not aid which comes weeks or months later . As per reliable statistics  provided by health sources in the United States . the projected cases can go up to 500000 cases per day by first week of May 2021 or maybe even higher up to 800000 to 1000000 
cases per day  by mid May to end May 2021 . 
 In view of above reports it is essential that the Biden 
  Adminstration  get it's act together and  ship all 
  aid to India in days and not weeks or months , to 
   avoid a humanitarian disaster of immense proportions which will affect humanity as a whole . 
 
  Sir , your help to India at this hour of dire need would be long remembered by the people of India .  God bless ."
2021-04-27 12:39,"The US should try to
Aid India and other countries both because it’s the right thing to do and because a global pandemic threatens everyone, but in the case of India it also seems that the Indian government is trying to blame others to deflect attention from its own massive incompetence and poor leadership: hyper nationalism with now deadly consequences."
2021-04-27 12:26,"Every full bucket begins with a single drop. So let’s get going! 

If a Republican president did this, Republicans would be hyping this to the point of nausea. But because Biden is a Democrat, the phony “weakness” of “not enough” gets promoted. Next we’ll hear that it all costs too much. 

The mishandling of this virus, especially by but not limited to Trump and Republicans, is costing the world in so many ways - loss of life, economic upset, the disintegration of our humanity. I applaud any positive moves, even a single drop in the bucket, but hopefully only the first one."
2021-04-27 12:58,"Millions more die of preventable diseases and hunger around the world. We should move toward ameliorating those problems, too."
2021-04-27 13:02,"1. Is Biden ""sending"" the vaccines to India, or is he lifting an embargo and the manufacturer is sending the vaccine? 
2. India is one of the world's largest economies. Who is paying for the shipments of vaccine and supplies to India? I hope it is not U.S. taxpayers."
2021-04-27 13:24,"India needs vaccines, but also needs technical know-how and guidance from the U.S. and EU in re-fitting their pharmaceutical facilities to produce their own vaccines locally.  Let's help them all we can.  Send advisors, if necessary. 
Remember, none of us are safe at all until everyone in the world is vaccinated."
2021-04-27 12:50,"I don't understand why the FDA takes so long to approve some of these Vaccines.  I do know that historically it has taken much longer; however, we are in a global crisis and I think it could move a little faster. India needs those Vaccines desperately and we should help it."
2021-04-27 13:22,"As the great John Donne stated best:

'No Man is an Island'

No man is an island entire of itself; every man 
is a piece of the continent, a part of the main; 
if a clod be washed away by the sea, Europe 
is the less, as well as if a promontory were, as 
well as any manner of thy friends or of thine 
own were; any man's death diminishes me, 
because I am involved in mankind. 
And therefore never send to know for whom 
the bell tolls; it tolls for thee."
2021-04-27 13:29,"Maintain a supply of vaccines sufficient to vaccinate all Americans. Send excess vaccines to poor countries at no cost but have a cost recovery plan for countries that can afford to pay(at some point). Some guarantees must be placed on all shipments so that vaccines don’t wind up on the black market. This is only the first of the pandemics that we’ll see in our lifetimes so we be careful of the precedents that we set.
 I can imagine a time in the near future where an enemy country creates a plague & a vaccine & blackmails the world...why bother with bombs that destroy hard assets?

Do not play around with changing intellectual property rights."
2021-04-27 13:32,"I thought the Biden Administration refused to change its COVID-19 vaccine distribution strategy, ""playing whack-a-mole,"" by sending more doses to Michigan, despite desperate pleas from Michigan. 

Now it wants to play “whack-a-mole” around the world? Better to just donate or loan any excess vaccines to COVAX, which is already set up to vaccinate health care workers and the most vulnerable in the developing world. After all, no one knows for sure which locales will be the global viral hotspots 6-8 weeks from now, when the vaccines currently in storage may start to make any difference; indeed, reliable epidemiological data about the past 2 weeks are difficult to come by in many corners of the world. Better to stick with COVAX, which is currently the only global vaccine distribution strategy."
2021-04-27 13:55,Canada has had to rely on shipments of vaccines from Europe and India and a very few from the US because of Trump's America First policy which Biden has continued. This is contrary to International Trade agreements which are supposed to allow commercial enterprises to operate free of government intervention. Europe continued to allow export of vaccines while the US didn't. Because of global trade Canada was not in a position to manufacture these vaccines in Canada although steps have been taken so that we will in the future. The US now has met its foreseeable needs and should stop the hoarding and release the restrictions on export.
2021-04-27 14:02,"India needs more than the vaccines, raw materials to produce vaccines in India itself. So, without being an hindrance in it, and keeping in mind that humanitarian aspect, Biden should not ban or block essential materials to India."
2021-04-27 13:58,"We should not rest on our laurels as far as Covid-19 is concerned for two main reasons: First, not everybody in the US has been vaccinated and that leaves room for variants to emerge and bypass the protection of the current vaccines. Second, the tsunami of infection sweeping India Brazil and some of the other countries may be a harbinger of things yet to come and may spawn a multitude of variants which in spreading back to the US will likely re-infect us all, including the vaccinated. if this happens, It will take several years and many millions more deaths for a global herd immunity to emerge. The only viable solution at this point in time, is to have a United Nations lead and coordinated mandatory global lockdown for 21 days covering every country with no exceptions and an international emergency medical corps to contain any leakages. The outlook otherwise might be too terrible to contemplate. The time for band aid may be over."
2021-04-27 13:39,"The next step the White House needs to confront is shifting allocations to states where supply exceeds demand, and continue doing so until all demand is satisfied and sufficient supply is stockpiled to cover the balance of our population not vaccinated, plus a reasonable surplus to cover unanticipated needs here.

At that point, others around the world could be assisted as capability permits here.

By what leap of logic would the US rationalize sending part of its existing short supply elsewhere?"
2021-04-27 14:00,"Covid loves a place like India, with its perfect recipe for a Feast:

Only thing USA is willing to export freely is advice on Democracy, Freedom, Equality, Justice to all...which are short on display there. The Left which is vocal on these has gone totally local...silent. Belief in India is they are punishing the target including the champion Media there.

Our tax dollars paid for all of this and I don't recall hearing a request from President Biden to his constitutes if he could send our tax dollars around the world. How are we going to be reimbursed? We, through our Senator's must have a say in this. I'm tired of billions of dollars being rammed through the Senate under Reconciliation. Didn't like it with either party.

""Brazil has the world's second-highest coronavirus death toll after the United States."". 

 Let's not forget about our ally and neighbor to the South, Brazil, facing shortages of everything; oxygen, sedatives for intubation, pain relievers and most of all vaccines and with over fifty percent of its population facing hunger. 

I am  hoping we will send the Astra Zeneca vaccines to them and other vaccine and aid when possible.  For humanitarian, health (we don't need more new Brazilian variants)  and political reasons it would be a good idea, rather than waiting for China to fill the gap."
2021-04-27 13:49,"It's been over 15 years since my wife and I had traveled to India to explore for a few weeks, but the density of their major cities has had me concerned since the beginning of this pandemic. I remember feeling constant crowding in Mumbai and Delhi. Train cars packed to the gills, sidewalks constantly full, cramped living conditions all around. There was just no way I could picture COVID not having a very easy time spreading amongst people.

While it is a shame we are looking to have so many spare doses  because too many Americans aren't smart enough to take them, we have to recognize the threat that other countries can play if COVID just spreads elsewhere unchecked.  We have to help.  

We also have to be intelligent with how we apportion what is likely to be a gigantic stockpile of vaccines as our production continues to ramp up. Because this supply will be plentiful, but still not enough for the world. We have the opportunity to help friends in need, and not help ingrates like North Korea.

The suffering in some of these populated countries could be huge if COVID really gets a chance to stretch its legs. We can help alleviate it. It's a situation that could cement decades of friendship. And I'm glad it's Biden picking our friends."
2021-04-27 13:46,"There are reports that India has 30 times more cases than reported, which is 1/2 billion cases."
2021-04-27 14:17,"I think Biden should extend it to include all available excess vaccines.

If Americans don't want to use their free vaccines, then President Biden should let it be known that we are going to continue to pay for and manufacture them, but we will ship them out into the world. India and Brazil, where the pandemic is raging, are good candidates but also to our neighbors in Canada and Mexico if they want them. We should also commit some to our long standing democratic allies in Europe.

In sales there is a technique or phenomena called 'fear of loss'. When some of our stubborn, anti-science, vaccine hesitant citizens see that ""their"" vaccines going abroad to our friends and neighbors, maybe they will insist that they get theirs first. Fine. Perfect.

The USA needs to commit to the manufacture of billions of vaccine doses and to back this up with our treasury. The goodwill generated will be a pleasant change from the Trump America First diplomatic fiasco. It will mark a new beginning and a return to what America really stood for!"
2021-04-27 14:38,We need to do everything in our power to help the people of India. The second-most-populace nation on the planet is suffering and needs to be rescued from the clutches of this horrendous scourge. They would do the same for us if the shoe were on the other foot.
2021-04-27 14:20,"I'd like to know what happened to the thousands of doses of vaccine that went 'missing' in the waning days of the former guy's administration. Did Trump sell them? Trade them in a barter deal? No one seems to know, or care. The world could sure use those vaccines now!"
2021-04-27 14:48,"As I write this, my brother in India who mercifully has a mild case of COVID but falls into a high risk category with heart disease, is in isolation. Unable to meet his new baby daughter born yesterday. 

He is spending his time on the phone frantically trying to arrange a bed and oxygen for a friend’s father. All the while knowing that if things went south for him, tomorrow it could be him we would be hunting for beds and oxygen for. 

We have seen and lived through a lot in India. But not a catastrophe at this scale. The utter helplessness, the stripping away of any privileges, the poorest as good as dead, I have to wonder if this is the universe righting our terrible wrongs. 

We will humbly take whatever help we can get. 
A grateful nation’s citizens thank you."
2021-04-27 14:41,Oxygen is OK. But monoclonal antibodies will save people's lives with an infusion in one hour.
2021-04-27 14:53,"Our vaccine availability exists in no small part to the failure of President Biden to move to the absolutely essential step of requiring vaccinations.  Herd immunity is the only path to normalcy.  The now dominant B117 strain of the virus is estimated to be ~50% more virulent and more deadly than the original strain.  This means that in 4 viral lifecycles (~8 weeks), we could expect nearly 4 times more people to become infected.  This math largely explains the increase in infections in places like Michigan despite reasonable vaccine uptakes for the above 50 crowd. The problem is that 1) only 7% of remaining eligible Americans indicate they want the vaccine immediately.  Nearly 40% are either delaying or full refusers. 2) The herd immunity rate will likely require 85%+ vaccination rates with vaccines as effective as the mRNA versions.  This can only be achieved through mandates.  This is how we tackled measles (97% effective vaccine requiring 95% vaccination rate).  President Biden should immediately issue an executive order holding all companies harmless to legal consequences for requiring vaccines and superseding the Republican governors' exec orders.   He should mandate vaccines for all federal workers, contractors, or any organization that receives federal funds.  This would cover a huge swath of the population.  BTW - 40% of military personnel are refusing to take the vaccine."
2021-04-27 14:45,"That's wonderful.  Send them ALL the vaccines that some Americans are refusing to get because of ""My Freedom!"""
2021-04-27 15:02,"Biden, instead of doing something to assure that EVERYONE in the US gets his/her shots, wants to offer what's deemed an excess of doses to India.  Do the math, Joe.  60 million doses would substantially reduce the number of unvaccinated people in the US, but it's a drop in the bucked in India.  To help that country fight its own pandemic, Biden should offer financial aid to India with the stipulation that it must be used to increase production of locally produced Covaxin vaccine.  Not only does it have good clinical results, it also offers a less challenging set of logistical requirements."
2021-04-27 15:06,Joe’s working as hard to unload that Astra Zeneca vaccine lemon  we bought but can’t use here as hard as Trump probably did one of his businesses that went bust.  How does it look to the rest of the world to graciously offer up to those in crisis something that’s been plagued with contamination problems and can’t get approved here and that we’re unwilling to use ourselves.  Joe with a heart as big as his should be offering our Pfizer and Moderna  doses to India and then preparing his sermon on love he’s going deliver to us once the calls for his head start coming from back back home still waiting for their shot.
2021-04-27 15:05,"It's a bit of a dilemma for the United States.  It is approaching the point of swimming in 'excess' vaccines - which logically should be shared with countries in dire need of doses - while at the same time America has significant portions of its citizens not vaccinated because they are simply unwilling to take the medicine.  

I've been following the case counts in Tarrant County, Texas where I have family.  This area, which includes Ft. Worth, is hard core Trump country and many there, including my relatives, believe Covid19 is a hoax.  Last week 
Tarrant County announced it would close its largest vaccination clinic due to lack of demand.  And yet only 25% of its population had received at least one dose and only 19% having had two doses.  

So, what to do?  Should they offer incentives like West Virginia plans to do?  (W.V. Gov. Jim Justice plans to give a $100 savings bond to those aged 18-35 years old if they get vaccinated.)  Or should Washington give up on these people and redirect vaccines to places where they desperately need and want the doses?"
2021-04-27 17:36,"In our own hemisphere, Brazil and Peru are in approximately the same shape as India; Colombia, Paraguay and Argentina are in worse condition than India, according to the NY Times CV-19 statistical pages. I don't understand why India is getting all the attention, except that an embargo is now lifted, which is a good thing. Now with that embargo gone for a country halfway around the world, what will raise U.S. consciousness for the countries in our own backyard?"
2021-04-27 18:46,"Even if our vaccine needs are leveling off, we should keep accelerating the production of J & J and Astrazeneca vaccines so that we can ship these to other countries that are in dire needs. No vaccine factory in the US or elsewhere should be sitting idle. Especially the J&J vaccine will be a godsend to countries like India. We have the capability and wealth to do this. This would go a long way in reestablishing our leadership position in the world."
2021-04-27 21:49,The 60 million doses is a good first step. Much more is needed.
2021-04-27 20:13,"This is not the first time we've sent poisons to India for testing. After all, they are not like us, are they?"
2021-04-27 23:34,"Typical American hubris.  We are nowhere near as good as we make ourselves sound.  But we love to build our self-esteem.
First, Astra-Zeneca is not approved in America.  Second, we already have enough doses of the other vaccines, we don't need A-Z.  We're just dumping what we can't use. When other countries donate their vaccines (and this is before they have enough for themselves) we accuse them of ""vaccine diplomacy"" and buying influence.  Like we never do that.  At least the other countries are sacrificing something, we aren't sacrificing a thing."
2021-04-28 0:45,"Health Canada says the AZ doses made at the Baltimore plant are ""safe"" yet they apparently relied solely on paperwork prepared by Emergent to make that call. How can a company proven to have cut corners be trusted to have thoroughly tested their product for safety and efficacy?"

2021-04-25 21:58,"This is very promising news, but the story seems to be based on interviews with EU officials, not US officials, whose perspective is lacking here. The US State department still designates EU countries as ""Level 4: Do Not Travel."" So as part of these ""negotiations,"" will the State Department change its travel advisory to Europe? I don't see how many American tourists can travel to Europe, even if allowed from the EU side, as long as their own government has a travel advisory against it."

I would hope by now that a simple test could have been developed which would indicate within 30 min. if a person tests positive for COVID or not.  Without such rapid confirmation, anyone could still pass on this virus.

I find the move to allow fully vaccinated American tourists to visit the European Union extremely promising.  However, for my personal comfort level, I think the notion of traveling, especially to any country, is still premature.  Maybe fall, maybe - could be the earliest for my husband and myself, but even then, especially at our age (aging silver seniors) we will be sitting out any foreign travel this year.  At the very earliest, next summer seems more like a possibility.

One of our cousins is a physician in London.  How we miss seeing him and his family and vice versa, but even he strongly urges us to remain home rather than to travel.  Just too soon to take such a chance."

2021-04-25 22:04,"This is encouraging but why do I feel it is driven more by the need for tourism dollars than based on science and public health evidence. I am itching to return to Greece in the fall and it looks like this may be possible. But, part of the allure is being able to mingle with people, eat outdoors or indoors, and explore freely.  If Europe can ramp up its vaccinations and get the positivity rate down, popping a bottle of bubbly will be in order!"
2021-04-25 22:06,"Great, if there is a chance that I can safely travel to Berlin in late summer, I am going. I have not seen my family since 2018 and I will be fully vaccinated before that time.

2021-04-25 22:07,They list all the vaccines but the one I got....AstraZeneka which was administered iin a trial and will have my card. They approved it so they should accept it. Also got one Moderna.
2021-04-25 22:08,So who's going to service vaccinated US travelers in Europe - unvaccinated locals?
2021-04-25 22:08,"Hasn't this been the problem countries and states rushing to open, why should Americans want to go to Europe when they can't even control the virus, the Germans couldn't wait to tell the world how wonderful they where in control the Virus they knew better then anyone else, just look at them now. Instead of worrying about Tourist dollars they should get the virus under control.
This is worst then letting people travel base on a test that only shown you didn't the virus at the time of that test."
2021-04-25 22:10,"Goodness gracious.  NYT readers seems like a pretty dour crowd. Maybe that's why the Times approach to the news re COVID up to this article often seems that the cup is half full.   While I agree with those below that we vaccinated Americans need to do every bit to support the US economy and get American service workers back on their feet, just try booking a room on Cape Cod or the Islands or in or near a US National Park.  Cape bookings are running at more than two times pre COVID levels for this time of year (according to the Fed's Beige book for Boston) and most rooms are sold out. For those that are left the rates have all been jacked up like the price of building materials. (I guess that's what happens when the governments Keynesian spends $4T and half the population gets vaccinated and decides to start spending the $2T of extra money they saved up during COVID.  Besides that this is a huge increase in Americans' freedom of movement.  To me whether you go or not this is a big reason for celebration. God bless America for its success in combatting COVID!! Viva la France!"

2021-04-25 22:15,"Impeccable timing.  The E.U. with this announcement is getting in line for the US tourist trade while many of us are still contemplating our options for the coming summer.

Europe doesn't want to lose a second summer of tourism."

Viking has very strict protocols posted, doctors and a clinic onboard, and I completely trust the company. Will see how they treat planned stops in Estonia—still high rate of infection, and Russia—don’t trust Russia’s statistics. Plan to wear a mask the whole time. Grandson has been in Europe and South Africa for several months, with a strictly controlled group, and his reports have been favorable. If this weren’t so serious, I would find a bit of humor in the prospect of never-vaxxing Trump supporters being unable to jet set to Paris. Guess they can get Together with Ted Cruz and go to Cancun instead."
2021-04-25 22:22,"I thought the US government said they would not issue a vaccination certificate, so how will the EU accept something that does not exist.  Will they recognize what is issued by the local provider.  I am in Los Angeles and I have proof from Carbon Health but, that is not the government."
2021-04-25 22:22,While it would be great to travel to the EU it feels quite premature when their vaccination program is very far behind. I would not want to risk getting stuck there as cases for up or even risk the exposure to Covid even after getting vaccInated.
2021-04-25 22:24,"I appreciate this is helpful for reuniting families.

Have to admit, it hurts that I'm likely not to be able to travel as a EU resident (due to not being vaccinated due to age and the slow rollout), or see my own family in the UK, whilst US citizens can do what they like. The EU/individual nations within deserve the vast majority of the blame for this, however, with its sub-par vaccine purchasing and rollout. 

Economies of states such as Greece and Spain likely rely on such actions, though, so perhaps it's simply necessary. Particularly as it remains to be seen how much travel e.g. Germany will be able to allow in the summer. 

Going to be a difficult summer for me and many other young EU citizens to see vaccinated older/middle aged people and Brits and Americans seeing their families and enjoying many more freedoms than we have, but I can't blame anyone for doing so, just because I can't. 

The governance on both the German and EU scale is another matter. I remain very pro-EU and anti-Brexit, but this is certainly one area where the disadvantages of EU governance have been clear to see."
2021-04-25 22:22,"One silver lining to the insane asylum we live in known as America, with its vast numbers of super-spreader Trumpees, non-mask wearing idiots, and vaccine deniers, is that we will soon have more vaccine for sane Americans and we can begin to ship Moderna and Pfizer to other countries starting with our nearest neighbors, and then to further regions including Europe.  The bumbling, EU leadership can try to turn the tide against their incompetence just as the US has begun to turn the tide from Trump's."
2021-04-25 22:25,"Canada next? I really want to see my family, most of whom are in the process of getting vaccinated, without having to quarantine for 14 days upon arrival."

See you soon Italia!"
2021-04-25 22:30,"I just read that a bigger problem emerging in the States is that a larger percentage of folks deciding to NOT get the second vaccination is rising.  I understand if they decline a second shot if there is a shortage of their original vaccine.  Moderna and Pfizer were not meant to be compatible nor interchangeable.

But other than that, I am amazed that more and more folks are simply not following through with the two-step program.  Not sure if a similar situation exists in Europe."
2021-04-25 22:30,"Vaccinations, like elections, have consequences. Probably yes masks, and distancing, and hand sanitizing, but yeah, it's time we get those gringo yankees back staring at the Mona Lisa or the Coliseum if they have had the correct needle in their arm the correct number of times."
2021-04-25 22:32,"Was on my way, slowly (car & ship) moving from Seattle to Ireland when I got stranded in the Northeast by covid over a year ago. Very pleased that soon I will be able to resume my move."
2021-04-25 22:31,"If you’re vaccinated and virus-free when you travel, it makes next to no difference how many other Americans have been vaccinated. There is no evidence that you can transmit
COVID if you yourself have been fully vaccinated. Granted, it is possible. But if travel were banned based on the possibility that I can make someone in Europe sick, then travel should be banned now and forever. 

It’s good to see that Americans are not the only ones who ignore science."
2021-04-25 22:31,"Well, I for one would look forward to boarding a flight, to Europe or anywhere, knowing that all my fellow passengers have been vaccinated. I won't board any flight until this happens.
A verifiable, secure vaccination passport, on one's cell phone like Israel has done.
Same for going into restaurants, movie theaters, stores, bars, etc. All clients have to be Covid free. 
With a universal , secure Vaccine Passport system, suddenly those who have not vaccinated yet, will be missing out, and vaccination rates will jump up."
2021-04-25 22:34,It's my understanding that we are close to having a 30 min test for COVID-19 antibodies (regardless of by vaccine or infection).  Maybe just apply that test at entry (or exit).  That way you get around fake vaccination cards.
2021-04-25 22:34,Why would anyone choose to not get both shots if it makes traveling possible and safer? Maybe this will encourage the anti-vaxers to rethink things.
2021-04-25 22:36,"It's a nice dream, but I'm not buying it. This is driven by tourism concerns, not science. I'll wait until Summer 2022, if then - with cases still exploding throughout the world, this seems like wishful thinking indeed."
2021-04-25 22:38,"Thanks for the permission to vacation in a region suffering from another surge in coronavirus cases ... but no thanks.

I have to wonder about some people's priorities."
2021-04-25 22:36,The unclear part is if countries (other than Greece) will allow those with a negative test to travel ? And if so if we will not to quarantine.
2021-04-25 22:41,"They--our governments, have all our information already.   A great deal of it is in our passports.  Why can't it include our vaccination status?!  I had to get a Malaria vaccine to go to South Africa.  I had to get the MMR series of shots to get into PTA school.  And I had to get a typhoid shot while in the military when I was being sent to Guam in the 80's.  So proof of vaccination, and a negative test is nothing complain about.  It will help us get back towards ""normal.""  Those who refuse, can stay at home, and deny science."

2021-04-25 22:42,"And what is the EU, not to mention US State Dept, offering in return for our travel dollars?

CDC/State Dept warnings re travel to many European countries were raised just last week to highest level (red), I assume because of poor virus management & slow vaccine rollout in those countries.

For months State Dept has warned Americans traveling abroad they may be on their own if they run into trouble -- our embassies & consulates working w/reduced staff & for limited hours, medical systems & hospitals abroad overrun with COVID patients, so could be hard to find treatment for ANY problem, borders could close at any time. Not to mention some insurers won't pay if people travel when there is red warning. So when does State Dept change its alerts to green, or at least yellow?"
2021-04-25 22:44,"My wife and I have been waiting to go back to France for more than a year.  However, they have to get their act together before I would think about going.  It's sad how the current situation there is now."

I spent three months on and around the Greek Islands with the base at Crete.  Look forward to getting back..but, will wait until the first set of travelers is allowed to move freely..and under what conditions."
2021-04-25 22:45,Will there be any required quarantine periods upon landing? Covid tests prior to and/or after arrival? (for the vaccinated that is)

2021-04-25 22:48,"What if we took a look at what New Zealand did? They did a great job, now have excellent and verifiable results.

What did they do to verify vaccination status? Reproducible here?

Etc. No need to reinvent the wheel if there might already be a functioning template somewhere."
2021-04-25 22:53,"Good so far, but getting back into the US needs to be clearly defined as well."
2021-04-25 22:52,I suppose if you are from Florida where proof of vaccination is prohibited you can’t go to Europe?
2021-04-25 22:52,"Nothing like helping us to reduce our carbon dioxide output in half by 2030 like encouraging us all to jump on jumbo jets and fly to Europe so we can wave our vaccination cards like a select members only pass.  It’s good for their business, sure."
2021-04-25 22:53,"I'm amazed the U.S. hasn't shut down passenger air travel during a deadly pandemic, with nearly 600,000 Americans dead.

How many have to die before we do?  Is 1,000,000 the magic number.

The more we play with this virus, the more likely it will mutate into something we can't control.

Note that New Zealand took this seriously, and has zero cases or so."
2021-04-25 22:53,It is premature to let Americans in while there is still no herd immunity in most of Europe. Vaccinated people can still spread the virus. The health of eu citizens should trump the travel desires of American tourists.

Not planning on getting on an airplane anytime soon due to Covid.  Also, can't afford it."
2021-04-25 22:57,"Great we can send you safe people, are you going to send them back in the same condition? The scientific community still not able to answer that question."
2021-04-25 23:01,"I wouldn’t trust American tourists to have valid proof of vaccination given reports of a wide spread market in falsified vaccination cards, a high percentage of “never vaccination/I want my freedom” trump supporters and the American penchant for cheating and no regard for others’ safety and health. Sorry, but although I’m an American myself I’ve lost faith in many fellow Americans after the selfish behavior and refusal to wear a mask this past year, the storming of state capitols protesting public health measures, the storming of the Capitol and belief in the Big Lie."

It is on my wishing list !"
2021-04-25 23:27,"The question does not end with American tourists being vaccinated; it continues to the embarrassing  question of what is being done to accelerate the slow rate of  Europeans being vaccinated.

My American children are already vaccinated; my French neighbors are not — at least not in sufficient numbers to approach herd immunity and constrict the  spread of COVID-19 or to resist development of new more virulent, vaccine-resistant strains of the virus.

After a more than 20 year career in US public health, I understand how America faced serious challenges rolling out vaccine delivery, until President Biden & his team  took extraordinary measures to overcome the fact that America has no seamless health system.

Knowing Europeans have elegant health systems — powerful tools, that deliver quality services comprehensively — I've been flabbergasted by failure of leadership that leaves so many Europeans unvaccinated

Europeans on the whole, also have better education, so in much the same way, I have been disappointed by the puerile arguments of those who reject vaccination, with absurd, selfish, pseudo-scientific justifications.

Experience forced me to expect failure & foolishness in American public health which does not pretend to reach everyone; over the 20 plus years I've studied & done research in Europe including the 10 years I have lived in France I have witnessed excellence here.  Whatever is going on with vaccine distribution, it's far from that."
2021-04-25 23:28,My husband just had to travel to Europe for a family emergency. Great that the EU will allow us but do we want to be there? Almost no one was masked. Tons of people in the streets and low rates of vaccination. Definitely will wait another year for a family vacation.

That said, I can't imagine going to Europe right now (a year ago, I'd have jumped at the chance to escape Trumplandia).  Most EU countries are struggling with vaccination (it will likely improve because they have ordered plenty but the deliveries weren't front-loaded) and variants.

The CDC cards are worthless. Republican redcaps have had the PDFs for fake for months, they share the cardstock weight and lot numbers stolen from photos of legit cards posted on social media. 

This is once more a case of the not-intended becoming the badly flawed standard, just as social security numbers were not meant to be identity numbers, but they are. And are stolen everyday.

A hundred years later, the US government has done no better with secure, verifiable vaccine proof, and that’s beyond disappointing. We can and should do better."

The State Department made no distinction between vaccinated and unvaccinated travelers, but based on CDC guidance saying it may safe for the vaccinated to travel, it seems some work is needed to set consistent policy and take vaccination status into consideration.

A word of advice for those who may consider travel: Traveling while vaccinated may be relatively safe, but I would be reluctant to accept any country's willingness to accept travelers with a negative virus test. If that's all you have, you're not well protected.  The US requires a negative test for those entering. If you become infected while traveling, you may not be allowed to return to the US. Consider the risk of that before traveling.

Those easily forged CDC cards are basically useless, but the state or medical provider who vaccinated you should also have an electronic record. Those should be the basis for any vaccination passport. New York already has this with its Excelsior Pass, although that might not be the right proof to enter Europe. Governor Ron DeSantis of Florida's executive order prohibiting vaccine passports may be impeding his citizens ability to travel.  And he thinks he's protecting their freedom?"
2021-04-26 0:13,"I have Airfare booked to Europe that I have had since last year. I rescheduled for September this year. 

I am fully vaccinated and have proof of said vaccine. It is going to be tough to navigate the different restrictions set up by each EU Country. Hopefully as more people get vaccinated in the US and EU the individual EU countries will start to open and ease restrictions."
2021-04-26 0:13,So many skeptical and fearful comments. I'm overjoyed with the news. I booked a trip to France in November for this Sept with only a faint hope that it would happen.  Now it looks like it will. This is great news for the travel industry.
2021-04-25 23:43,Sorry Europe.  You are not good enough for me.  I'm not going to beg to come there.
2021-04-26 0:13,"On the flIp side of that story, I’m not in rush to visit the US either. Considering the significant number of people in the US who have said that they will not get vaccinated, I cannot see exposing myself needlessly to COVID. The world population needs to get vaccinated before things can get back to normal.  For 2021 and likely 2022 my travel will within my home region.  Gonna save my money."
2021-04-26 0:16,"The USA is NOT safe, even with vaccines.  The issue of variants arises and CDC continues to advise against international travel. As an American, I wonder if travel to Europe won't bring their variants here.  This is premature.  No one should engage in pleasure travel to Europe.  Please stay home and keep your dollars here.  Your country needs your $$ anyway."
2021-04-26 0:16,there is no alternative the world economy needs to open up.. wear a mask distance yourself get the vaccine if not your on your own
2021-04-26 0:17,"I live in the US on a non-immigrant visa and have been unable to go home to Ireland for over a year now, due to the travel ban preventing non-citizens/green card holders entering the US. I hope Biden repays the favor and lifts this travel ban."
2021-04-26 0:17,"Our vaccine cards are nothing more than what comes in a wallet for your name and address.  No raised seal, nothing that can’t be easily duplicated by scammers.  The date, place and batch number are hand written in and can easily be copied.  I consider my vaccine card meaningless to anyone but myself."
2021-04-26 0:18,"Not so fast. Covid-19 cases in several E.U. countries is on the rise if not declining due to either a systemic lack of vaccinations, or a reluctance  to get vaccinated.
As someone who has family and friends in Germany -- and who also survived the virus after contracting it last March, I am inclined to say; ""No. Not yet"" to whatever the European authorities have to say until they have their numbers under control regardless of how much I want to travel to see them.
Because after spending two months in the hospital in recovery and one month in rehab learning how to walk again, nothing is worth going through all that again.
And it would behoove all Americans to think twice before they do the same thing.
Getting the vaccine is only addressing half of the problem.
Best to think about the other half."
2021-04-26 0:18,I am very thankful for the modern marvel of biopharmaceuticals that created the vaccines.   It is also encouraging that the government and the private sector can work together.
2021-04-26 0:20,The pandemic playbook needs to have CDC + FEMA running everything at a national level. This state by state stuff is ludicrous
2021-04-26 0:21,I cannot wait. The reluctance of so many states to impose proper restrictions and vaccine reluctance here has made me not want to vacation in the US this summer.
2021-04-26 0:24,"The world is about to be broken into two tiers, those who have accepted vaccination for Covid and those who have not.  And it is right that this is so as the vaccine is now available to almost everyone, the one exception children under twelve or currently sixteen and this exception should be closed as soon as humanly possible.  Those vaccinated can not be held hostage by those who choose not to be vaccinated who by their choice have chosen the route of further suffering.  The vaccine offers freedom, but freedom especially in this case  must be chosen."

While I've been itching to make the visit happen, I don't see any reason to go at the earliest opportunity while so much of Europe is still in deep turmoil from this disease.  So no, I'm not going to rush to the airport and fly to Europe just yet.  Instead, I'm going to wait at least 6 months (if not longer) so that I can enjoy myself in peace and without any worry."
2021-04-26 0:37,"Americans in Europe take bus tours with other Americans, walking tours with American professors, visit the Eiffel Tower, move quickly from museum room to museum room, and eat at restaurants and stay at hotels that are overpriced and avoided by natives.  In the winter,  they go skiing , where they keep their distance for safety sake. In the summer, they go to beaches and keep a respectful distance from everybody else. 

The  only close contact Americans have with natives is when they ask them to take their pictures, generally from more than six feet away. 

American tourists are COVID-safe."

I booked for June in Greece, which is already open to US  vaccinated or negative COVID travelers then will go visit family in France when they open. Oh boy, FINALLY! I'm even looking forward to the long flight!"
2021-04-26 0:44,"I won’t be going to Europe until I know the countries are fulling open.

2021-04-26 0:41,"“Because one thing is clear: All 27 member states will accept, unconditionally, all those who are vaccinated with vaccines that are approved by E.M.A.,” she added. 

But later in the article it was stated ""individual member states may reserve the right to keep stricter limits. They might not permit citizens from outside the bloc to visit or might enforce restrictions like quarantines, even on visitors who have vaccination certificates."" 

So will vaccinated Americans be allowed in unconditionally or not?"
2021-04-26 0:44,You'd probably be better off going to England as more of their population have been vaccinated that in Europe. And I think the virus can spread even if you have been vaccinated; all vaccinations mean is that you won't die if you get the virus. I'm thinking they need to improve the product because I don't want two vaccinations and have to repeat that annually. I don't think that happened when the pandemic happened approx 100 years ago. You just got one vaccination and that was the end of it.

2021-04-26 0:45,"No way.  No way should ANY of us rush to escape your local city or state or country.  Even if you’ve been fully vaccinated.  Take it slow.  Pay attention.  Don’t rush into a trip somewhere, just because you can.

Think. Use your head."
2021-04-26 0:55,"So the EU will accept US tourists, and yet I see and hear nothing about the Canadian border situation.  As a trans border property owner, I am still prevented from crossing to access my property, to visit family and friends etc, even though vaccination rates are quite high in the US, and rising (slowly) in Canada.  I understand that Canada is in a tough situation now, but I don’t ever see or hear that there are even the most rudimentary discussions between governments as to a re-opening strategy.  

The irony is that Canadian travelers (snowbirds) have had a work around the whole time.  They routinely ship their vehicles to Seattle or Plattsburgh, then fly into the states perfectly legally, pick up their cars and go where they wish. Or they fly to Miami or Phoenix with impunity from Canada. Even returning to Canada is a piece of cake, as they can return via land without quarantining, something they must do if they return by air.

Even in you live in land locked Point Roberts WA, or Angle inlet MN, you can’t drive the 20 minutes across CDN soil, even in a sealed car.  It makes no sense.

Bottom line, I am all for continuing to be as safe as possible, but I think some rational border strategy ought to be made public with definable bench marks about who can cross if and when certain criteria are met."
2021-04-26 0:53,"This is going to create further devision in our population at a time when Asians are being targeted, blacks are targeted, whites are targeted, Latinos are targeted, Muslims are targeted, etc . No one should feel obligated to take an experimental drug, not matter how advanced we think our medicine is. Experimental means experimental. 
 It’s unethical. Hence why we are not legally obligated to get vaccinated. We just have to deal with the peer pressure, propaganda, manipulation, and fear mongering. Anti-vaxers, hold the line!! We will not submit, we will not concede. We will not acquiesce, we will not give in."
2021-04-26 0:56,"We're going into winter in NZ and I was at a market day yesterday selling winter sweaters and a lovely couple, an American and her NZ born husband bought lots of sweaters. Both  came back to New Zealand to escape the pandemic in the USA. They said they were from Hawaii. And they said they were so pleased to be back in NZ where there is no community transmission of the virus. It made me realise how lucky we are in NZ to be covid-19 free.
The USA is probably welcome in all countries because they make the vaccine and everyone wants to get their hands on it; I have to admit if it wasn't for USA we wouldn't have any vaccines as the ones our NZ government signed a contract for never turned up because they said they needed the vaccines for their own people.
So, that's a good public relations exercise when USA  honours its international contracts for the vaccine."

Why would I leave California to go to a region that this far into the pandemic has failed to control community spread and is nowhere near herd immunity?

If there are to be any travel restrictions, the data indicates that California should ban travel from the EU ... except for Portugal.

2021-04-26 1:49,How can Europe open to tourists when ICUs in hospitals are still strained with COVID cases? And why would anyone want to travel on planes for hours and then day after day touring wearing a mask? What kind of vacation is that?
2021-04-26 1:53,One note of caution.  The European vaccine rollout is slow and steady.  It's definitely well worth checking local museum opening dates and local Covid restrictions before making concrete plans.  If last summer is a guide I expect the med resorts to be pretty lively from July on.

By July, Italy was able to reopen because they did the intensive lockdown in spring 2020.   However, by the time we returned to Seattle in Oct 2020, Italy had gotten worse and the US better.

I am transgender and take a lot of hormones, and am afraid because I know the vaccine was never tested on people like me. Im also afraid that these blood clots in women may have something to do with hormones, and that I may be at risk given I take way more estrogen everyday than a cis-gender woman has in her body at any given time. I would be happy to get an anti-body test to prove I have anti-bodies, but I dont want a vaccine until its been tested more on transgender people. I am afraid that my work, which requires travel, will be taken away from me with vaccine passports. Or that I will be coerced into taking a vaccine where the risks are unknown for people like me. And the risk of Covid for 33 year olds in perfect health is known. Its essentially zero. Why would I take a vaccine with unknown risk to protect me from a virus that has almost no risk?  I have yet to here a coherent answer to this question.The previous argument I could accept, that Im protecting old people, has been made moot due to vaccination of the old. Mostly Ive been told Im a Trumpist, which as queer, MIT-educated person I find not only dismissive but sad. Ive seen no data proving to me that transgender people taking hormones are safe, and if I did see this data I would be happy to take the vaccine.

No vaccination-no entry. Real simple."

When they get their act together, we will resume travel."
2021-04-26 2:53,We have both been fully vaccinated since February but decided to wait until 2022 for international travel. There are too many unknowns and we expect huge crowds with the delays and problems that brings. We’re limiting travel to an off season road trip this Fall.
2021-04-26 3:26,"Two comments:

1.  A vaccinated traveler is unlikely to bring the virus to their destination, so it’s relatively safe for EU to allow them in.  But that doesn’t necessarily mean it’s wise (meaning safe) for the traveler:  Social distancing is harder when visiting museums, monuments, etc. It means more dining in restaurants.  Thus more chances of being exposed to someone who is infected (and worse, someone who is infected with a new variant).

2. Not clear that our hand written vaccine records really qualify as government issued proof of vaccination."
2021-04-26 3:30,"I got my second shot this past Friday and I have plane tickets to Europe in mid-July.  We have to get back to living and eschew over-the-top risk aversity.

2021-04-26 3:35,"This is fantastic news and the only reasonable thing to do. The EU's vaccine effort has been slow, but it is now picking up speed. Europe is about 8 weeks behind the US. I for one would be happy to travel back to the States or to have my family come here from the States. I guess the only question is how open will Europe be in a general sense. At a certain point, with the vaccine, we have to get back to normal. This idea of staying at home and never flying again until people in the most remote corners of the world are vaccinated is getting a little much. Let's be reasonable about this - the US and Europe can get back to normal and then over the course of the next year can get the other countries back on their feet. We are not going to be able help out anyone else if we are crushed economically."
2021-04-26 3:35,"My wife and I love to travel, both domestically and internationally. We had a trip to France cancelled last year due to clvid. And we have both been vaccinated. But it feels, at least to us, that 2021 s a good time to stay domestically. The vaccination programs are progressing in the western countries, but it still is a pandemic, and new variants keep popping up. This seems like a good year for would be tourists, whether American, European, or otherwise, to appreciate what is offered closer to home. If by the end of the year, things are looking much better, it will ne time enough to book something for 2022."
2021-04-26 3:36,"Thank the Lord!  I do most of my traveling in Asia and the Middle East but I did want to visit Italy at least once in this lifetime. We're now learning that lots of Americans who've gotten one shot of Moderna or one shot of Pfizer have decided to forego completing the regimen. If so they're mistaking Covid for a headache and a vaccine for an aspirin.  Ah, well: that'll mean fewer tourists for me to have to contend with."
2021-04-26 3:42,"I haven’t been home to the UK since 2017 and I’m desperate to get there—but, assuming that the UK follows the EU’s lead, I’m still leery of making the trip. My sister had planned to come here in September but she, too, is hesitant to make a booking.

I just don’t think we’re quite there yet. We’ll see how things go, but with nastier variants already circulating, eh, maybe next year."
2021-04-26 3:56,"Unless it is clear that museums and restaurants, etc., are actually open, it doesn't matter very much that one can enter a country.  I'd like considerably more information before planning a trip."
2021-04-26 4:01,"Such wonderful news! I can't wait to work in person with my colleagues in Europe this summer. I've already received a digital passport from the health provider who administered the vaccine. My great hope is that there aren't counterfeit cards or passports that could ruin clearance for those of us who are vaccinated.
I'm feeling incredible gratitude to President Biden and his team for making it possible."
2021-04-26 4:20,"If Europe were vaccinated at the same rate / level, this would make sense. And the U.S. hasn't reached vaccination levels that would curb the spread of the disease and variants. 
Our cities have been shutdown for many months in the common battle against this virus, businesses have gone under, savings have been exhausted and our children have missed out on basic life events. We will squander this sacrifice?
As for my family, we will be spending the entire summer in the mountains, far away from tourists."
2021-04-26 4:23,"Well, yes, but right now the US government says  “do not travel” to the EU, in fact, to practically the entire world (level 4 advisory by the Department of State). Is anyone paying attention to that? We are locked in, even if not likely to remain locked out."
2021-04-26 4:47,What about families where children under the age of 16 may not be vaccinated? I assume the children will still be excluded? Making travel for the family still impossible?
2021-04-26 4:55,"Fully vaccinated, pro-vaccine, and zero problem with international Covid passports until the pandemic is over worldwide.

Fully object, however, to domestic Covid passports, and normalizing presenting medical ID multiple times per day.

Seems a fair position to take."
2021-04-26 5:02,"As an American living near Barcelona, this article made me want to call all family in the USA and tell them to book their tickets...but I encourage all travelers to carefully research their E.U. destination for specific guidelines and shutdowns. So many things- museums, hotels, restaurants, cultural centers, etc are still closed or have very limited hours with no information on when they may reopen. It may not be the European holiday of your dreams if you can’t go out for dinner (all restaurants in our area must close at 5pm) or visit that iconic destination. Yes, businesses want tourists to return, but the vaccine rollout here has been incredibly slow. In my region they are still vaccinating the over-70 population so I find it hard to believe the rest of us will be vaccinated by summer. 
Just words of caution as folks plan their summer travel: Europe may open the doors, but individual regions could remain very much closed."
2021-04-26 5:42,"The way this and other articles report is a bit one-sided? My American friends complain that the EU does not want them to visit. At the same time they do not seem to be aware of the fact that travel bans and regular immigration issues are mutual. There is not sufficient mention of the US travel ban on the Schengen countries which is in place since March 2020. It has not yet been revoked, in my opinion that is reasonable. So why make a big deal of the EU travel ban for the US? Actually, I do not care so much for tourism, I need to travel for work, as a scientist. My colleagues at the US national facility that I work with need the support from external users to conduct large scale experiments. I am about to be inoculated and I hope I can join them for the next experiment campaign in fall. Meanwhile, I would appreciate if you did not make travel bans out to be merely a luxury problem."
2021-04-26 6:09,"Proceed with caution. The situation in Europe remains highly unpredictable, with economies opening up and closing down with very little notice. Rules vary widely from country to country — and even within individual countries, e.g. in Germany, where you can’t even rent a hotel room if you’re not on business, at least anywhere you’re likely to want to go. Even though it’s allowed, the government here is imploring us not to travel if we don’t absolutely have to, and curfews are in force in hotspots all over the country. Masks are obligatory inside stores (presuming they’re open at all), ditto in museums. Up our way, restaurants are open, albeit only for outdoor dining. If the numbers go up again, which wouldn’t surprise me in the slightest, not even that will be possible. Crossing borders is a pain, and often practically impossible. 
That said, the campaign to get needles into arms is finally gathering pace here. Maybe by summer things will look  different. But it’s not much fun in Europe yet. 
Besides, in a global pandemic, you’re basically part of the problem or part of the solution. It’s probably best not to stray too far from home yet. Why not wait a couple of months longer? Take a tip from an experienced traveler: Paris is infinitely more enjoyable in October than in August."
2021-04-26 6:22,"Although tourism is an important item for Italy's economy, let's not forget  that the country is second in Europe only to Germany in terms of industrial out put and, excepts for certain areas of the South, does no depend from tourism as much as  Greece and Croatia do.  

Also, Italy does not have (luckily) the  kind of tourism you see for example in  certain area of Spain(Costa Brava) where masses of Briton and other Northern European tourists go to get sunburned (and often also to get drunk). Usually tourists choose Italy for the same reasons they choose France that is art, landscape and cuisine. 

In recent years visitors instead of going in the same places (Venice, Florence, Rome)  started to appreciate other areas especially in  the North, or aspects such Italy unique biodiversity.

Keep in mind  that a percentage of the loss of tourism revenues this year will be compensated by the 4/5  millions Italians that usually travel abroad during the summer. Massive booking from the Alps to Sicily already started in the beginning of April and the same is also true for France, since it looks that the French are not traveling abroad either, especially because the county did not handle Covid very well.

In any case no matter where you will go in the EU, most likely you will have to wear a mask in public, even if vaccinated."
2021-04-26 6:54,"Of course, this must go in both directions. I remember very well when Trump declared at the beginning of the pandemic - and as one of the few measures to address it - that all EU citizens except from the UK are barred from entering the U.S. He did this without any consultation of the European partners he despised and considered as enemies."
2021-04-26 8:00,Here in Ireland we are unable to travel beyond our county boundaries and pubs and restaurants still closed. Vaccines are slowly being given out. At this rate it’s hard to imagine just when any kind of normal will be. But we live in hope!
2021-04-26 2:58,"EU under pressure to open up but haven’t sped up the vaxx process or dealt properly with anti-vaxxers on its own soil — majority of the ‘southern tier’ Europeans are still not vaccinated including in the coveted tourism industry. As a double citizen American-Italy, they have not vaxxed past the age of 60 here yet."

However, I’d have to see whether Europe will be truly open itself with restaurants, bars, museums, and safe (covid-wise) hotels ..."
2021-04-26 5:26,"In Ireland we currently aren’t allowed to even travel between counties. Our pubs and restaurants are still closed, and we’ve only reached 68 year-olds for vaccination.

As a mid-30’s person who has lived here for awhile now, I’d say having buses of Americans going around the country anytime soon would be political suicide for our current government. It’s a bit of a pickle as a lot of businesses here rely on tourists (especially from the States), but the dynamic this would create in our present situation would be quite upsetting for those of at the end of the queue.

Imagine being months the away from a vaccination appointment, walking through Times Square, and seeing hundreds of Irish people having the best meal of their life at NYC’s finest restaurant, ESPN Zone. You’d be thinking, this comment suddenly took a weird turn. And hasn’t Esperenzo’s been closed for years? Lads, I don’t know! I can’t even travel outside County Dublin!

Anyway, bring some vaccines with you. We can’t wait to hear about your great great grandmother from Kerry!"
2021-04-26 3:52,"Has there been any discussion about how/when/whether children, who remain unvaccinated, will be able to travel to Europe?"

We're a red country now and today started a strict 2 week lockdown.  Bring your cell phone.  While this country wants tourists, it still requires them to text message the government prior to going out, like the rest of us.

(This policy seems unworkable as they have a long way to go to vaccinate younger people)."
2021-04-26 2:58,"I don’t know really what politics have to do with the vaccination; but since it’s being brought into this discussion, I will say that I have been fully vaccinated and I am a Republican. I know many Republicans who were vaccinated as soon as they were able. These people always wear masks when they are outdoors and follow the coronavirus guidelines. They not only are thinking of their fellow man they are thinking of themselves also. I think to make a blanket statement that Republicans are the only ones that do not get vaccinated is totally false.￼ 

There are also Democrats who refuse to get vaccinated and follow coronavirus rules.￼ And they do not social distance or wear masks. They too should be called out on this whenever it occurs.￼"
2021-04-26 4:18,"Welcome news indeed. I am an Irish citizen living in the US, I just had a planned trip home for June  canceled by the airline presumably due to the mandatory quarantine in place in Ireland. I am fully vaccinated but my 7 year son obviously is not, nor will he be for the foreseeable future. I would greatly appreciate some guidance on this situation. Given the information we have on transmission and severity of COVID with kids will they be given an exemption or will they not be allowed to travel? I am sure I am not alone wanting to know this, especially since I have been told in no uncertain terms by my family that they don’t want to see me unless the kid is with me too :)"

2021-04-26 5:35,Too early. Too many unknowns. Get ￼￼￼a clear picture of the Covid hospitalization rate of the area you plan to visit. Your vaccination won’t protect you from impacted medical systems if you have a non- Covid medical issue. I can’t believe the lack of patience and common sense. Look around you. There’s so much beauty out our own back door. Get re-acquainted with the US. I’m thinking 2022...maybe. Enjoying areas closer to home is hardly torture. Especially compared to 2020 lockdown.
2021-04-26 3:58,Americans need a digital coronavirus vaccination passport that cannot easily be faked like the paper CDC cards. I really don't care what the vaccine-refusers think about that.

2021-04-26 8:12,You know that life is getting back to “normal” when you hear Americans in town again. I really enjoyed Paris last summer without the tourists.
2021-04-26 8:25,Good news for Europeans and Americans. As things stand the EU and US would both reach her immunity by June. Vaccinations as picking up steam here after initially exporting a lot of vaccines to amongst others the USA itself.
2021-04-26 3:04,...and we should restrict travel inside the US to the vaccinated.
2021-04-26 4:39,Just think: We will be in Europe this summer with other Americans smart enough to vax and selfless and sensible enough to mask.
2021-04-26 4:36,I wonder how they will deal with the scammers and cheats who really didn't get vaccinated.
2021-04-26 9:07,Wonderful.   I shall be first in line.   Our family is double vaccinated and will happily display our cards.   We are so looking forward to our visit to the South of France this coming summer.

2021-04-26 3:40,"One scenario to consider:

What if you go to foreign city for your summer vacay and that city imposes a proper lockdown on day 2 of your stay?

A lot of travels this summer will be done by those who are now slaves of social media — the very lonely people who finds meaning in their lives via likes and hearts and comments and shares. Those who can’t eat without taking a photo of their plate. Those who can’t order a cup of takeaway coffee without bragging.

Without these narcissists, we covid would have been gone earlier. But no, social media is a beast that must be fed, even if risking infection."
2021-04-26 9:18,"I am from Europe and I could only suggest my fellow American to wait before making a booking. The epidemic was very low in Europe in Summer 2020 and they expected that it would stay low, we have seen what has happened. They now make exactly the same prediction for 2021. In case of an outbreak in the summer, you could expect problems like not being allowed to leave your hotel (especially in the southern touristic countries)."
2021-04-26 4:45,How about just having results of a test for covid?
2021-04-26 9:16,"My advice: Don't come this summer! It'll be a waste of money and a very depressing way of spending your holidays - restrictions almost everywhere - like masks even for vaccinated people.

Instead plan a trip through your wonderful country! Visit Yellowstone National Park, make a trip to Gettysburg for 4th July or visit the National Museum of African American History! Or chose one of the 1,000 other remarkable opportunities you have!

But stay away from the lost places called European Union..."

The impatience of people will keep spreading this virus. Just because you want it over doesn’t mean it is. We’re in the long game."
2021-04-26 9:57,"American living abroad here. It should be mentioned that the EU and many other Schengen countries are woefully behind in vaccinating their own populations (including Switzerland where I live). While I am happy to see tourism open back up for Americans—my family can finally visit after more than a year—it should be noted that many of these countries are still in various states of lockdown restrictions that might not be conducive to your typical tourist experience. If cases among the local population rise (and they are with new variants that are spreading while we wait to be vaccinated), expect things like curfews and shutdowns of tourist attractions to pop up on short notice."
2021-04-26 10:21,"I think this is great and one of the points of the vaccine campaign (although obviously not the primary one), I.e. providing people, safely, with greater freedom which in turn will re-stimulate the economy, help small business etc.  Hopefully this encourages people on the fence or currently refusing the vaccine in the US to get it which is better for us all!!"
2021-04-26 10:34,"Travel and tourism between EU and US may help the economy a bit, but may prolong the agony of fighting the virus and waiting till the end of pandemic.  The longer it takes, the longer we will truly recover from the economic bottom.

What we witness in the performance of the stock markets is a short term impact of the government stimulus packages in one name or another."
2021-04-26 10:46,"I understand Europe's desire for tourist travel to resume as tourist trade is vital to their economies, but what is best for this country? The pandemic is not over and there are over 40% American citizens that refuse to get the vaccine shots. What's to stop these European travelers from bringing back a variation of the virus that we don't have an immunity to and start a new pandemic? In addition, there are US citizen's that refuse to accept a vaccine identification cards or any other means to denote whether they have received the vaccine or not. We have to stop pretending that the pandemic is over when it is not. It's not yet time for business as usual until Europe and the US have shown that they have defeated this virus and that it is safe to return to some version of normalcy."
2021-04-26 11:07,"Meantime, most European countries have fully vaccinated less than 20% of their populations, and currently cases in Greece are surging. This is a prime situation for breakthrough cases among those vaccinated tourists. Since the US requires a negative test before return, I can imagine sick American tourists stranded in Europe, and new variants brought into our country for those cases that are not detected by the tests. We all want to return to normalcy but the pandemic is not yet over."
2021-04-26 10:23,"This announcement by EU is premature. The variants are on the rise and it is hard to predict where the next surge will be . India too thought it's Covid days were over till it came back  with a vengeance. I am sure for most vaccinated Americans traveling to Europe it is like going to their city center which they have done many times and will get their chance again. So why not wait some more ,since you have done so for only 14 months or so? Also,  it may not be such a good idea if one has to  face a sudden lockdown in a foreign land. What would be worse is getting the virus mutant back as a souvenir. While Europe needs tourist euros desperately we must not be desperate to put our and others' lives at risk."
2021-04-26 10:48,"This is fine, but any information on when the US will open its own borders? I’m in Scotland but my family are in Seattle, and a new baby on the way very soon.

2021-04-26 10:13,"The digital vaccine passports are going to be problematic.

1) They have yet to be developed, tested, and deployed. 
2) Even if brought live tomorrow, how will the tens of millions who have already received the vaccine be given a digital certificate?
3) The paper cards are the only forms of “proof” most people carry. Presumably you’ll be able to convert it to a digital passport. But how...by taking a picture? Fraud will be rampant. 

The process of validating paper cards via medical records will be far too burdensome to be even remotely realistic."
2021-04-26 10:19,"I'm curious how Europe will deal with Americans trying to fraudulently claim that they have been vaccinated.

2021-04-26 11:39,At first sight of this article I felt excited and ready to go back to Europe. To revisit the places I have been and loved and explore new cities that I have dreamt of seeing. Then I remembered that the EU has had some slow down with vaccination. Has the speed of vaccinations in the EU increased and what will travel be like by summer (not that far away)? I am not sure if traveling at this time is really going to be as enjoyable and be wort it for someone like me who saves for trips like this.
2021-04-26 11:44,"I do hope that the pandemic has taught us that our consumption of resources is hurting the world and climate.  Perhaps it is good economically in the short term and this is wonderful news for those with family members etc.  
Perhaps those of us who are privileges can look at our travel and limit our pleasure trips.  Or purchase carbon units to offset emissions.
At least bring it into our consciousness and think about it."
2021-04-26 12:04,"The shutdown was the first time in decades that carbon emissions fell. They need to keep falling if we are to have a future for ourselves and our children. Jet setting and business travel need to become things of the past. The latter is unnecessary with Zoom and the former is a selfish, shallow waste of resources. 

The airlines shouldn’t not be bailed out without provisions that they start innovating away from carbon emissions and towards sustainable means of air travel. Only then should touristing resume."
2021-04-26 12:16,"On the one hand this is great news!  Last year we canceled our planned bike tour in Spain and throughout the pandemic we've longed to return to Paris and finally get to Berlin.

But on the other hand -- should we really celebrate traveling to places as locked down and devoid of the same energy that has been sapped from NY and LA where we make our homes?

As we're vaccinated, it's great to have this opportunity.  But I fear it's a hollow one.

Until life returns to some ""normal"" (new or old) the thrill and joy of travel seems to be empty."

2021-04-26 12:12,"Letting vaccinated U.S. tourists into the EU will show how well the 3 vaccines the EU has approved for U.S. tourists stands up to th B.1.1 7 variant,  and to unvaccinated individuals, which is most of the EU. 

The EU  in future, will only use Pfizer as they deem AstraZeneca and Johnson & Johnson as less effective and dangerous. 

Passing a PCR test is a worthless criteria for letting U.S. tourists visit,  mainly because passing it offers zero guarantee against catching the virus, and tourists will get sick among the EU's  largely unvaccinated population. 

The travel/tourist industry craves money, but at least  in the EU,  the government has kept afloat small businesses, airlines and hotels by paying 80% of salaries and operating expenses until the virus is tamped down. 

But the U.S., particularly Trump Republicans, electeds and their supporters, have refused to be vaccinated.  No one is discussing non-forgeable proof of vaccinaion certificates. 

This U.S. rush to the EU is too fast,  and ill-thought out, on both sides of the pond."
2021-04-26 12:12,"I've thought  all along, since vaccinations became widely available, that public amusement places (read bars, restaurants etc) should be divided into ""vaccinated only"" and a""anti-vexers without facemarks"" only.  No compulsion, just  winnowing of the population by choice.  Europe is acting with a semblance of rationality is making the same choices for US citizens and well they should."

2021-04-26 12:10,"Money ,Money ,Money that's all that matters  to humans as the world burns down. Just what the atmosphere needs is more planes flying, more pollution and there will be  more variants developing as we continue to spread the virus. 
Tourist I hope you  enjoy your trips but do say  goodbye to your loved ones in other countries  .                                                             We are such fools but as a species continuing with mass extinction of the planet  we do deserve this. Of course except the children and  young people who only at most  have a few decades left."
2021-04-26 12:58,"So why would one want to get on a plane for eight hours and go to Europe with masks, and endure any other local restrictions that are surely to be in place when you land? See you in 2022."
2021-04-26 12:59,"yes,  it is all about leisure..."
2021-04-26 13:10,"Thank you, but no thank you.  

I will take my vacation somewhere nice enough but where I cause less harm through my travel or activities."
2021-04-26 13:11,Already booked our trip to Greece! This fully vaccinated couple is ready to check off some more of our life’s bucket list trips.
2021-04-26 13:15,"Thanks but no thanks. Until the US requires vaccination evidence of all travelers who want to fly, whether domestically or overseas, I will not mix and mingle in the airport becore boarding a flight, no matter how much I may want to go to Europe."
2021-04-26 13:25,"The problem with this is that you still need a negative COVID test to come back into the US.  In Japan, one organization was charging $400 for that.  Until the US does away with this requirement, it is hardly worth it to go to Europe.  Besides, the State Department just put about 80% of the world on the category 4 do not travel to list.  Does that tell you something?  Then there are the CDC recommendations.  No, until the world is free of COVID, or until I can be reasonably certain of not getting the disease or carrying the disease even with a vaccination, I will stay away.  I have traveled the world and would like to go back, but not at the risk of mine or anyone else's health."
2021-04-26 13:28,"It would be lovely for international families to see each other again after a year plus of separation. Vaccinated grandparents aren’t getting any younger. If caseloads come down like they did last summer, I can’t imagine what other benchmark we’ll be waiting for before opening up for travel."
2021-04-26 13:34,"I recently flew. I am fully vaccinated and I flew first class due to the safety and low price. What I saw was people using the excuse of eating/drinking to keep their masks off the entire flight. Ice cubes in bottom of glass; still drinking. One pretzel left in bag, still eating. This letter of the law vs. spirit of the law went on for the entire flight after the first beverage service. Nope, not until everyone on a plane has to be fully vaccinated."
2021-04-26 13:35,"There are too many uncertainties that can change one’s plans at the drop of a hat. 

Leaving the U.S. is one thing. Getting back in is another."
2021-04-26 13:36,"Thrilled to read this!
 We have trips lined up overseas already for 2021 (scary choral singing, to boot!), but assumed we'd  have to wait till autumn. 
We'll  still go in the fall, but only as summer's  a dreadful time to travel in Europe.

So glad to see our lives opening up again, thanks to the vaccines."
2021-04-26 13:38,"I lost sleep over this last night: How can the EU open up to tourism this summer when, for instance, France, where I live, has a current April hospital reanimation capacity rate of 118.2%?!  It does not seem wise, either from a health or a political standpoint to put France's universal healthcare system in jeopardy to satisfy American Wanderlust.  The cost to France's excellent social democracy could be far higher than any profits reaped from American tourism and excessive materialism."
2021-04-26 13:44,"Thank you President Biden for your commitment to getting the vaccinations to as many people fast! 
This has allowed the world to engage in conversation to restarting travel. As a parent/grandparent we can finally see our family in France after 11/2 years. 
You can’t imagine how thrilled we are that the opportunity is right around the corner!"
2021-04-26 13:45,"My quick two cents:

Travel here in Italy (can't speak for the rest of Europe) is premature. Stay home for now. Why?

Just today, Italy softened restrictions for most of the country. We can now travel between towns and regions; restaurants and bars can now serve outside and the curfew is later. Some museums and sites are opening. Good stuff, sort of.

EXCEPT: most of us have NOT been vaccinated. This process has been going abysmally slow in Italy and, given the last time Italy ""opened up,"" the COVID numbers skyrocketed and the government locked us down hard at the end of 2020 and again in January of 2021. 

I suspect that, by the end of May, if Italians aren't more fully vaccinated and if they don't play by the rules (which it seems they don't), we will be locked down again.

Sure, it isn't great economically for tourism to be put on hold, but, believe it or not, the virus doesn't care if your selfie-stick is lonely."
2021-04-26 13:52,"This is great news. However, I'd still feel more comfortable going to Europe after its own vaccination rates are a bit higher. Yes, I realize that my vaccination is supposed to be 90 percent effective, but there's a lot of play in that 10 percent to pick up the virus in a largely unvaccinated population."
2021-04-26 14:23,"In ye olde days--not so long ago--travelers had to carry the small yellow CDC international vaccine booklet when traveling to certain countries in order to prove that vaccines for specific illnesses (yellow fever, cholera, and others) were up-to-date. In February of 2020, I carried that booklet to South America. Though those vaccines have been around longer than the ones for Covid, it never occurred to me that getting vaccinated was dangerous or an infringement upon my freedom. I grew up in the frightening era of polio. As soon as it was my turn, I got the Covid vaccine. I have already received emails from nature travel outfitters who have trips scheduled for the last half of this year. They require participants to be vaccinated. I don't have a problem with any country or region--or school, sports venue, concert hall, etc.--requiring a vaccine certificate. This virus has been devastating and heartbreaking. We need everyone, everywhere, to be safe."
2021-04-26 14:25,There are a lot of us who are fully vaccinated and want to travel but don't want to get on a plane with unvaccinated people. The airline industry should tap into this market by offering flights that only fully vaccinated people can board.
2021-04-26 14:36,"These nations requiring vaccinations need to have serious felony charges against any American who falsely claims to have been vaccinated.  I noticed that people are selling vaccination cards on line so those who refuse to be vaccinated can falsify a card in order to travel to places that require that they be vaccinated.  
Any conviction should be months if not years in prison for this crime."
2021-04-26 13:28,Great. We booked tickets to Europe a few months ago banking on this development. We can finally visit our family after two years.
2021-04-26 14:59,"But big question is WHEN will which restrictions be lifted?? and will costs have escalated.  With the current administration adn the FED having managed to get the price of oil UP and inflation starting to thrive again... travel will probably more expensvie much more expensive than it was just pre-Covid.  On the topic of countries/cities dependent on tourist to provide jobs..  NYC among them -- if Trump and Biden hadn't decided to sweeten the UE payments lots of people would be worse off and their landlords and the utility companies and perhaps the gracery stores.  But once upon a time before everything was made in countries where people are paid very badly  - things-- clothes, shoes, dishes, cars, steel, telephones, computers were made locally.... and tourism by definition was less a factor for the economy.  

With the diminishing middle class  I truly wonder what will happen.. Of course, thus far there are more people on the planet annually.  Travel in a world with nearly 8 billion is very different from travel in a world with 3.8 billion."
2021-04-26 15:00,"My husband and I are all vaxed and have accumulated enough miles to travel to Europe round trip and afraid we’ll lose them if we don’t use them this year. 

As some comments here from France and Italy point out, if Covid is still prevalent by September 1st we will certainly cancel. 

So we’re crossing our fingers that we can keep our travel plans for mid-September to mid-October.  
Since our niece and some college friends in Reykjavik, Amsterdam and Paris would be putting us up, we wouldn’t have to worry about hotel/AirB&B cancellation fees—just disappointment."
2021-04-26 15:15,"I am a US citizen and needed to travel for family reasons from Europe (where I am a permanent resident) to the US earlier this month. Everyone with a plane ticket was required to have a negative PCR test no older than 72 hours in order to board. The plane was about half full, most passengers were fairly well distanced, and all had to wear N95 / FFP2 masks the entire flight. 

I will need another PCR test to return, even though by then I will be fully vaccinated and beyond the two week waiting period. I can't imagine my state will be at the point of offering ""vaccine passports"" and doubt they will be accepted by EU health authorities this summer season.

Americans will still have to mask up and socially distance if they want to travel to or within Europe. As of this writing, restaurants, hotels and most indoor activities are either closed or limited mask-only access. If it were me, I would focus my leisure travel on the US this year and makes plans for that European trip next year."
2021-04-26 15:16,"guarantee me every european or other tourist is vaccinated.

i would stay with friends i know are vaccinated just because of who they work for. it is required.

almost looks like europe is fishing for the latest, greatest variant."
2021-04-26 15:17,"I wonder if the EU will require travel insurance that covers Covid related illness costs or  the costs related to quarantines  for travelers to the EU.  

Costa Rica does, and it is not cheap."
2021-04-25 22:42,"Unfortunately, this won’t incentivize the large group of Americans refusing to be vaccinated. 

However... if we required full vaccination to attend NASCAR races, country music concerts, and football games... we’d be at herd immunity in no time in the US."
2021-04-26 2:49,"Lets face it.  Some of the EU Countries need the money.  Europe banned us for so long.  I say, ""Let them eat cake""!"
2021-04-26 7:25,Can't say I'm thrilled by this idea. Most EU countries  still are lagging far behind US/UK in vaccination rates. Americans don't mask up properly and don't think of others.
2021-04-26 12:24,"All fully vaccinated people should be allowed to go anywhere. Isn't that what being vaccinated is all about? And I don't want to hear about virus transmission still being a possibility. Because, the amount of virus a vaccinated person may transmit is too small to infect someone else. It's probably going to be 2022 before the 'return to normal' ramps up. Meanwhile it's going to be slow going."
2021-04-26 13:27,Hope Great Britian does the same. Already booked my golf trip to Scotland and England
2021-04-26 13:59,"Welcome news, but my decision will depend on how much is open."
2021-04-26 14:15,"A lot of comments about anti-vaxxer republicans getting a fake vaccine passport, but you have to understand this group.  In general, they don't travel much outside the US, they usually don't like Europeans (bunch of socialists), and many don't have a lot of money.  So how many of these folks will risk whatever penalty is put in place, to buy a fake vaccine passport to travel to Europe? Not enough to worry about."
2021-04-26 14:48,Boy I sure do hope Europe is as strict as possible on us Americans.Our paper vaccine cards are so easy to replicate. People are falsifying cards here. With all the Trumper's there just isn't any way to truly trust half our country. I hope after what Italy and France just went through they recognize they need to be super vigilant with Americans. If I don't trust half my countrymen and women neither should the rest of the world.
2021-04-26 13:33,"Umm, yeah go ahead and book travel to the EU for summer.  You'll be wearing masks when you walk outdoors, and you can fight over the few seats open at outdoor cafés. Maybe you'd have more fun spending your time in the U.S. where the virus cases are much lower."
2021-04-26 15:05,"I'm so grateful for this news! I tried to study abroad last fall for my French minor, and after 4 semesters of Zoom with my great but challenged junior college, I can't tell you how excited I am to get the chance to be yelled at in person by my new French professors."
2021-04-26 15:21,Not every U.S. traveler is a tourist!
2021-04-26 15:10,"What's up with the scape goating prepwork here? The EU has _absolutely no authority_ to ban or lift travel impediments to all of its member nations. It can mediate, and with a majority vote maybe achieve something here, but the idea that an EU commissioner can just decree which vax doc holders can enter, say, Hungary, is factually wrong. So when the news will break that the EU cannot, in fact, do so, I already hear the screaming voices that Europe is chaos and hence the EU should now be abolished. What a PR disaster setup."
2021-04-26 15:08,"Wait a minute.  Americans can travel to Greece or Croatia which are in the EU, but they can't go to France? What will prevent them from flying or taking a train to France or Italy?  And people wonder why the virus keeps spreading."
2021-04-26 13:49,Need to get more exercise and refrain from spending so much time on the couches.
2021-04-26 14:14,What about vaccinated adults who would like to travel with a young child who is too young to be vaccinated? Will that be possible?
2021-04-26 14:05,"Ok great, so now you can come to a place where restaurants are shuttered and beaches have mask requirements. Americans, I’d recommend Florida this year."
2021-04-26 13:23,"How is the EU going to get proof that an American is vaccinated. Our governments are not issuing Vaccine Passports or IDs. 

We (Americans) are so selfish and entitled that many of us will lie about vaccination and put EU people at risk. Many Americans either think this is just a flu or simply don’t care if they hurt others."
2021-04-26 14:18,"Mostly banning most non-essential travel for more than a year??? Hahaha. No. That's the reason while the second/third wave had Europe firmly in its grips October-March. But sure, when we came to Czech Republic from NYC last August (at the time when Covid prevalence in NYC was 10x LOWER than there), we (at least officially) had to go through the Covid-testing/quarantine theater (not that anyone checked). But I welcome the news, and scratch my head about how the new rules will apply to children who can't yet be vaccinated."
2021-04-26 14:22,"Implementation is key of course.  Since the individual state health departments hold the data that ties an individual to her vaccination status, some who are vaccinated might have difficulty with the willingness of their state government to share the data.  Think Texas."
2021-04-26 14:45,They need to open up travel with the UK if anywhere! I’d feel much better going to a destination that has better vaccination rates in their populations.
2021-04-26 15:09,"Negative test results are still the best way to travel safely at this time. We will certainly see a rise in ""break through cases"" otherwise just like we saw a rise during Passover/Easter/Spring recess."
2021-04-26 13:37,"This is good news, I envision the Europeans  will once they have their vaccination roll out completed introduce a Vaccine Passport system similar to  that of Israel.  No evidence of vaccination ' No Entry'.  
While Americans continue on this mindless focus on 'Individual Freedom' we will never get to a point where  people no longer have to wear masks or not social distance. The rest of the world sensibly believes in enacting rules that  are for the 'Common Good' . 
So in London and Paris  the Arts  and cafes will once again thrive  but in America they will continue to languish  because of the segment who refuse to  get vaccinated and a federal government that refuses to make them account for their making that choice by not introducing a Vaccine Passport. 
Thereby denying Commercial enterprises to make decisions that benefit all of their customers."
2021-04-26 15:04,Looking forward to visiting our (vaccinated) son and daughter-in-law in Germany in late summer — lots of outdoor activities.
2021-04-26 15:00,"Since vaccinated people can still pass the virus on to others, expect a spike in cases in the late summer/fall. And, travelers should remember that the vaccine does not stop them from getting Covid. It just means they aren't likely to die from it. But, you can still be sick and even possibly suffer some of the long-term effects that patients have reported. Enjoy your vacation."
2021-04-26 15:37,"Outside of happy relatives and families reuniting, I am guessing the traveler's experience of Europe and it's offering of sites, museums and street life et al will be somewhat stymied. Curious to see. I'd wait a year."
2021-04-26 14:01,"Ho will the vaccination cards, that can very easily be forged, be replied upon for proof of vaccination? Does the CDC or do the states have vaccine registries that could provide a more reliable proof of vaccination?"
2021-04-26 14:01,"It is clear that this is short term thinking, US and EU lobbying for consumer travel jobs over public health.  We have no idea about new strains like the situation in Michigan and the many individuals who are unvaccinated who work at points of entry, transit and hotels who are in danger themselves as for example in Italy many remain unvaccinated.  I hope the NYT re-does the article from a bit ago about how countries in Europe are re-thinking tourism.  As this bowing to US lobbying is more of the same stupid consumerist thinking and jobs plan that got our world into this situation in the first place."
2021-04-26 14:17,At this point the question should be whether or not we let you back into America without quarantining if you choose to go to Europe.
2021-04-26 14:35,What happens with families with children below 16 years old? Even if we want to get our kids vaccinated we still can't
2021-04-26 14:46,When will the US open up to vaccinated Europeans??? It certainly seems unfair if they don't do so.
2021-04-26 15:03,"I find the word ""let"" is somewhat hypocritical, when you think how much Europe depends on tourism."
2021-04-26 15:32,Do the vaccines work or not? If it work why should we still mask and limit our lives?
2021-04-26 15:49,"In 1958 and 1966, my family and I travelled to Europe carrying our required smallpox vaccination booklet. Europe (pre-EU) didn’t require it for entry but the US did. We couldn’t renter the US without it. The Riverside County Department of Public Health issued the certified booklet, which was a federal publication. I still have mine.

How quickly we forget."
2021-04-26 15:49,"Travel is one of the great joys of life.  I cannot wait until I can visit Europe again.  I have always been respectful of other cultures and their local laws and will obey all requirements to keep others healthy and safe when I am afforded the privilege of visiting another country again.  As a fully-vaccinated American citizen with a valid passport and a curious mind about foreign travel, I don't think it's selfish or crass to want to experience travel again.  And I want to support other economies.  I'm saddened to see so many negative comments here."
2021-04-26 15:54,"My partner and I have been separated for 15 months, because he's an Australian working for an American company in London. I can't wait for any kind of access. I'm vaccinated and so is he. We are willing to take and any all precautions. We want to be together -- safely."
2021-04-26 17:11,I will stay in the U.S. and travel. Plenty of places to explore. Too early to experiment in overseas travel.
2021-04-26 12:27,"It is the dream of the vaccine companies that vaccination will be required to resume your normal life.  Doubt that requirement will ever happen.  Half of all republican men do not plan to get vaccinated.  Will airlines and cruise ships give up their lucrative business ?  Doubt it.  

Plus ,  getting the vaccine doesn’t mean you won’t get and spread Covid.  Makes much more sense to require a negative Covid test.  I just checked entry requirements for Ireland , where I have travel booked for 2022.  No vaccine requirement listed.  Just the negative Covid test."
2021-04-26 15:49,"I just don't get the, ""I won't get vaccinated. It's a hoax. It's a scamdemic, etc, etc."" Do these people refuse to get rabies vac for their dogs?

Doesn't society have a right to protect itself? In the 1950s-60s, you couldn't send your kids to school unless they'd had their shots.

Unless you have spiritual or medical issues, you should be required to prove you've been vaccinated. Society has a right and a duty to bar you from as much interaction with the general population as practical if you're not vaccinated. Have to go to traffic Court, but not vaccinated . . you're guilt by default. Want a US passport? Bring your proof of vaccination or stay home. Renew your driver's license? Prove you aren't a carrier."
2021-04-26 16:26,Bottom line: Europe needs your money.
2021-04-26 17:15,No mention of whether the US is considering doing the same for Europe?
2021-04-26 15:59,"Here's a thought; if Americans don't want to use their free vaccines, then President Biden should let it be known that we are going to continue to pay for and manufacture them, but we will ship them out into the world. First to our neighbors in Canada and Mexico if they want them; then down to South America where the pandemic is raging.

We should also commit 10% of any excess supplies to western democracies, our long standing allies in Europe.

In sales there is a technique or phenomena called 'fear of loss'. When some of our thick-headed vaccine hesitant citizens see ""their"" vaccines going abroad to our friends and neighbors, maybe they will insist that they get theirs first.

Fine. Perfect. The USA needs to commit to the manufacture of billions of vaccines and to back this up with our treasury. The goodwill generated will be a pleasant change from the Trump America First diplomatic fiasco. It will mark a new beginning..."
2021-04-26 17:57,Curious if anyone has insight into how children (who can not be vaccinated given their age) with a negative test may be considered for travel with parents that are vaccinated.
2021-04-26 14:16,This will be great for the bottom line of the fake vaccine certification business.
2021-04-26 17:52,Will the EU relaxation of their restrictions include Canadians (North Americans) as well? That is not clear for the news story.

2021-04-26 18:06,"Very interesting and positive article, so I wonder (as related to Italy) why there is the information in the link below which is the website of the US Embassy and Consulate information for Italy? In addition an email of the 21st April from the Italian Embassy in Roma indicated this, ""The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has issued a Level 4 Travel Health Notice for Italy due to COVID-19, indicating a very high level of COVID-19 in country. Visit the Embassy's COVID-19 page for more information on COVID-19 in Italy. There are restrictions in place affecting U.S. citizen entry into Italy. Italy has a longstanding risk presented by terrorist groups, who continue plotting possible attacks in Italy. Terrorists may attack with little or no warning, targeting tourist locations, transportation hubs, markets/shopping malls, local government facilities, hotels, clubs, restaurants, places of worship, parks, major sporting and cultural events, educational institutions, airports, and other public areas."" The EU truly needs to coordinate their information about American citizens entering Italy as well as Italy addressing the sentence relating to terrorism. Reading the information on the website and the email is not very encouraging for any type of travel to Italy!

2021-04-27 1:36,"It's almost comedic on some level. Large parts of Europe depend on tourists as a mainstay of their economy remaining healthy. Not Europeans traveling mostly by train mind you, but Americans, Canadians, Australians. And let's not forget the Chinese. 
Meanwhile many parts of America are desperate for tourists. NYC, Florida, California. Our national parks on the bucket lists of folks. Not so much Americans, but tourists from Europe, Australia, and let's not forget the Chinese. 
Australia loves tourists too, although the visits aren't for the same reasons like seeing world famous museums or archaeological sites. It's far away, but let's not forget the Chinese!
India loves tourists. So does Thailand, and Peru, and Egypt, and . . . let's not forget the Chinese. 
All the articles about climate change and Biden and 2030 targets . . . and we can't wait for things to get back to ""normal"" so folks can fly all over the world to take selfies proving Kilroy was here? 
I can hardly wait, like Godot should be arriving any minute now. 
We are collectively an incredibly stupid species, and we deserve everything that's coming our way with climate change. Well some of us anyways. Problem is everyone will be in harm's way. 
Pogo was right. Translate that into whatever language they speak in the country you're planning on visiting next that requires a plane trip."
2021-04-27 2:37,"I’m sure Europeans, lacking vaccines due to American selfishness, are clamoring to welcome hordes of “ugly American” tourists to exacerbate their COVID woes."
2021-04-26 15:30,"This is great news for those of us considering leaving the US to live in another country. I’m not yet prepared to do a full residency visa, which has been the only way to get to Europe. A group of friends did that, but I’m not ready to commit sight unseen to an apartment, let alone a country. So this summer’s two month site visit is key to our planning. I’m in a group of about 20 African Americans who are fed up with white domestic terrorism, voter suppression, mass shootings and police murder and are planning our ex pat lives. I’m Black and I’m rich and I have options. I can do better than America."
2021-04-26 3:04,"President Trump should get some of the credit for asking pharmaceutical companies to quickly develop a vaccine for COVID-19. Quite frankly, he should get a lot of credit. Cost was no object in getting these vaccines made quickly and efficiently. 

It took a businessman who became a president to develop a vaccine that was urgently needed into the arms of so many millions of people. Again, thank you President Trump.￼￼￼"
2021-04-26 6:08,"Vaccinated people can still be sick & spread Covid. Moreover, many of them would be asymptomatic. So, when they come to the EU, they would still spread Covid and being asymptomatic would make it worse for others. Therefore, in fact, there is no logic in EU actions. Moreover, many countries use some other vaccines that are no less efficient than Moderna, Pfizer the killer for elderly and AZ the killer for young via blood clots. Making such vaccinated people out discriminates them based on political reasons or any other reasons known to the EU bureaucrats only. 
Anyway, I’ve been to Europe many times and lots of other places, so I’ll not miss you & travel to lots of other parts of the world"
2021-04-23 10:50,"I'm a physician and professor at a good medical school. In the summer of 2020, when Moncef Slaoui of ""Operation Warp Speed"" was on TV, I was flabbergasted. He argued that buying 100 million doses from 6 vaccine makers was enough, and ""why would you buy more vaccines than you need?""

I wrote my students to tell them that the US was making three huge mistakes. First, there was the obvious covid minimization by the President and other politicians. Second, the US should have planned and implemented a 24hr/day national immunization program, to immunize the entire country as soon as possible. And third, the US should have purchased doses for 300 million Americans, in case one vaccine had better results or fewer side effects than others. If we over-ordered, and the risk profiles of the other vaccines were excellent, then we could offer vaccination to the rest of the world.

The Biden administration is digging out of a mess that was unnecessary. We should not be losing hundreds of Americans a day to Covid at this stage."
2021-04-23 11:01,"“Our current thinking is that this risk could be managed by inclusion of warning statements,” Dr. Fink told other experts at the first advisory meeting last Wednesday.

This is curious wording as inclusion of a warning statement would acknowledge the risk but certainly not “manage” it. 

It seems like with the J&J and AstraZeneca vaccines, both based on adenovirus delivery, about 1 in 100,000 recipients (mostly women under 50) develop these rare but serious blood clots. The risk of death (and also blood clots) is much higher with a coronavirus infection so it is clearly beneficial for everyone to get vaccinated. But if scaled to a billion people you are talking about 10,000 healthy people developing these serious clots after vaccination.

Why not limit these two vaccines to men of all ages and women over 50? Then use the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines for women under 50. This would mitigate the risk greatly."
2021-04-23 11:02,"It really bothers me that they won’t be transparent with the details about new cases. My 19 yr old daughter received J&J a week after the woman died. If we knew, of course she would not have received it. This is why people don’t trust the government."
2021-04-23 11:21,"I really, really, really don't  understand why they took the pause in the first place.  Six cases out of 7 million?   At a time when the pandemic is still raging in the United States?  I understand that the system called that an abundance of caution.  I call it something close to insanity."
2021-04-23 11:59,"I had the J&J vaccine 2 weeks ago. I feel I’m entitled to know how many more cases have occurred since they put the halt on the vaccine. When they say there have been more, but won’t say how many, they lose credibility with me. Given how many people are refusing to be vaccinated, credibility is something they government and vaccine makers can’t afford to lose. Tell us the numbers."
2021-04-23 11:46,"It is good news if the pause on the single dose Johnson and Johnson (J&J) vaccine against COVID ends, not in 6 months. With a fatality rate of 1 in 7 million it is not very different from flying in a commercial airlines or going on a cruise ship. But certainly adults with underlying conditions such as being predisposed to clotting disorders should refrain from receiving the J&J vaccine. For certain people the low risk can become high risk and a certainty and such people should get anyone of the other vaccines. There are many complexities with vaccines with regard to possible complications

My neighbor who I happen to run in told me that me a few days ago that he was due for his second dose of Pfizer vaccine today. His next question was whether he should go ahead with it considering he happened to be sprayed with a weed killer and had severe rash which looked horrible even after steroid treatment. He also was on antibiotic treatment for cat scratch. I thought over it for an hour and my advice was to postpone the second dose until he fully recovers and has completed the steroid and antibiotic treatment. He was in agreement to postpone his second dose by a week. The CDC guidelines offer a flexible window for the period between the 1st and 2nd doses and so my advice was also consistent with CDC guidelines. Love thy neighbor as thy self.

Today I enter into a Co-immunity study in Louisville, KY. The purpose of the study is to identify warriors who have fully recovered from COVID."
2021-04-23 11:57,"I understand testing for efficacy and toxicity. Perhaps as another reader indicated, put a warning label and perhaps restrict the vaccine to men and to women over 50.  

Another related issue is which US agency authorized emEmergent BioSolutions to manufacture the Vaccine?  Did politics play a role?  The facility in Baltimore had a history of poor Mfg Practices. Why would JnJ, a highly reputable Big Pharma want to mfg contract mfg to Emergent, and damage its reputation and sales?  Emergent and it's Board / CEO must be held accountable for the lives lost and costs of destroying 25 million doses."
2021-04-23 10:35,"Thank goodness we now have people in the power positions that understand & take action -like this pause in giving the J&J vaccine. And once again, we can regain trust in the CDC, FDA & other groups that direct impact on these decisions.
It should be very reassuring to everyone that this required -- especially since this is a Emergency released form.  It does me.
The public needs to understand that Drs/medical personnel have to have several pts with unusual events Before they realize something is going on. And then to report it.
Only then can attempts be made to determine :
l- How to alert Drs. to identify & report.
2- Determine the diagnosis  & decide what to do with drug.
3- Determine treatment & disseminate this to all Dr.s-- everywhere.
Please note-- everything depends on the Frontline Drs. to identify, report & treat appropriately!
Would that this would be explained more clearly & directly to the public. 
Remember, we don't know, what we don't know."
2021-04-23 11:45,Stopping the use of J&J will go down as perhaps the worst blunder of the CDC. It has affected the entire world.
2021-04-23 11:59,"6 cases out of 7 million shots?  More people were run over by a bus.  My wife and I got the J&J shot, and I have zero concerns."
2021-04-23 11:55,J&J is SAFE.
2021-04-23 12:20,"I got the J&J shot on Saturday, April 10 when an appointment suddenly became available.   I opted for it based on my age and particular needs.  I'm 58, have not been infected by COVID, have no health issues, and am perfectly fit.  Yet I know how vulnerable any of us are to this terrible virus.   My original appointment had been for the Pfizer on May 31 but I thought it was too long to wait for.   Even with the disturbing news about the women and one man who suffered blood clots, I don't regret choosing the J&J because it had been tested later than Pfizer and Moderna after the variants came out. This summer, I have to work in three different places (one of them in Europe) with young people in their teens and twenties from all over the world. Some will probably not be vaccinated.  I am thankful for the data that is available these days online.  It kept me sane even after the J&J pause.    A sense of proportion is all we have now to be responsible for ourselves and those around us.  There were never any life guarantees pre-COVID anyway.  On this subject,  re-reading MEDITATIONS by Marcus Aurelius has helped me a lot since March 2020."
2021-04-23 12:43,"Dr. Fauci said the pause would be a matter of days.  As with most things headed by federal agencies days have turned into weeks which is unacceptable.  

I appreciate caution and concern but just based on the data that as a science trusting person that I am the data does not seem to have required this pause.

The CDC should have been working on this day and night to come up with a resolution.  They want the American public to remain steadfast with masking and social distancing but where is their sense of urgency?  This has taken way too long."
2021-04-23 17:16,"6 cases is likely a mirage. Whoops, now it is up today to15 cases. That is 15 reported cases where significant medical investigation was done. There may well be many more under the radar cases of small non-debilitating incidents.

But that said add one more being reported to the CDC and FDA  today 4/23/21. 9 days after receiving J&J vaccine at Atlantic City Mega inoculation site, clot in brachial artery of my daughter in law was diagnosed. She was kept in the hospital for 4 days on blood thinners.  CAT scans, MRIs, Ultrascans and blood tests out the wazoo were performed. 
She was released yesterday and advised that in 30 days the need for surgery would be assessed and further follow up for 90 days and possibly for lifetime would be needed. Between medical with a Silver Plan max out of pocket and loss of income, the cost of the free vaccination is going to be quite substantial."
2021-04-23 12:42,"Dr. Marks refusal to share how many new cases have developed stands as a glaring example of why the public has people who refuse to get vaccinated.  Dr. Marks is probably right in that the numbers are not high enough to merit halting the vaccine.  But to those people whose relatives have died---and to those who have to make the choice whether or not to risk the vaccine---their one death matters.  Americans want full transparency.  Facts let us decide if it is for us.  Only then is trust built.

I have first hand experience of what I speak.  My 92 year old mother-in-law feared vaccines and did not take the flu shot annually.  She trusted the CDC on Covid vaccines and blew our minds when she took it upon herself to schedule the Moderna.  2 days after 2nd shot, she was found semi-conscious.  Adverse reaction left her hospitalized and in a rehabilitative care unit until she died last Sunday.  Moderna acknowledges that there have been elderly adverse consequences.  CDC does not publish or share.    My husband and I got the J&J.  Learning from experience, we talked with the company before, but were never told of incidents of blood clots, even though they happened. 

Knowledge probably would not have changed our decision on J&J.  But I had the right to know before deciding.  The limited amount of information on vaccines and their interaction with say even the common cold is not available.  CDC hiding under the EUA cloak is not enough.

Dr. Marks, share all knowledge. Build trust."
2021-04-23 12:45,"If I were on the committee making this decision, i would recommend holding further use of Johnson and Johnson-- if we had adequate supplies of the Pfizer and Moderna Vaccines. Honestly, I  would not take the Astra- Zenca Vaccine or Johnson and Johnson vaccine if I were a women of child bearing age.  Scientifically the difference in these vaccines is the use of viral vectors/a viral infection  to manufacture copies of the spike protein that triggers the immune response. Somehow this may be related to this rare clotting disorder.  The mRNA vaccines do not require the use of a viral host to transmit this information and seem to be quite effective.  I feel comfortable strongly recommending these mRNA vaccines to everyone including the most skeptical antivaxers and women who hope to get pregnant.  I do agree that the rarity of these clotting events usually would not preclude their use; however, in the environment in which we are living --where millions claim to believe in QAnon and a fraudulent election  result .  Reality and the influence of public opinion has to be considered and not simply the science."
2021-04-23 21:53,"Ramp up production of this safe vaccine and send it to countries who have populations that have trust in their government officials. 

Americans won’t take the JnJ because social media will demonize it. However, the JnJ vaccine will do tremendous good. Send it overseas where it will go to good use. 

We are shutting down vaccination centers because of low demand.....

Land of Plenty"
2021-04-23 15:03,"“Dr. Marks declined to specify how many new cases had been confirmed, but said the rate of the disorder was not expected to be higher “in terms of the order of magnitude.””
This lack of transparency is what is feeding hesitancy. The number of cases of CVST with thrombocytopenia should be reported.  So should breakthrough infections and safety trends, on a weekly basis. Withholding the information only serves to foster distrust and there is a lot of that around these days."
2021-04-23 12:44,I hope someday a medical statistician can tally up the net cost in lives caused by pulling a product off the market with such a minuscule record of bad side effects! Fewer than one in a million are way better odds than riding in your car and certainly better than the odds of contracting Covid and becoming seriously ill. We don’t seem to have learned anything from the Nobel prize winning ideas of Daniel Kahneman and  his late colleague Amos Tversky on how risk perverse humans can be.
2021-04-23 12:58,"Trump tanked confidence in the CDC, even with Operation Warp Speed, and Republicans and anti-vaxxers are still at it.  So every effort has to be made to assure the doubting public that the vaccines are safe, not because a politician says so, but because evidence-based research does.  I think what’s most odd about it is how we choose our risk tolerance.  This country goes overboard assuring the safety of drugs, toys, food, autos; nearly every consumer good and medical procedure.  Gold standard, they say.  Yet we do nothing about guns and the risk of death by gun violence has been normalized.  What a strange thing."
2021-04-23 20:00,"“Few” is a relative term, as the panel reported nine new cases—more than doubling the number of original cases—of this very serious and dangerous side effect of the vaccination. 

When you have a rare risk of a serious and devastating side effect, doubling or even 10 times-ing the number of cases still leaves it as a rare risk because of the large numbers involved. But that doesn’t mean these increases aren’t clinically significant. And for the rare patient who gets it, it’s a catastrophic 100%.

The question now looms as to whether it’s just going to be considered the cost of doing business with this Johnson & Johnson vaccine, or whether the vaccine should be targeted to, say, just men, or not recommended for women with certain risk factors.

A physician MD"
2021-04-23 21:30,"The trick here is not to think too hard, right? This seems to be the storyline - J&J vaccine goes into widespread use, all use is halted due to fatal and unusual blood clots, slap warning label on box, same exact vaccine goes back into widespread use. There’s zero way to process that sequence of events without either acknowledgement of a serious error taking place or an fu to society. Just don’t think about it."
2021-04-23 16:21,"I read in another news source this morning that an Oregon woman has died after getting the J&J vaccine.

The CDC and FDA might not care if ""only a few WOMEN get untreatable brain clots and die"" but I care if I die.  What good is a ""warning"", except to the government and insurance companies?

No wonder people don't trust OUR CDC and FDA.  Too many of us have suffered and/or died from BIG pharma profit-making, direct-to-consumer advertisied drugs.

 The j&J vaccine production site in OUR USA has serious problems.  Yet they allow them to continue to get OUR hard-earned taxpayer money and manufacture even more deadly drugs.

It's crazy when there are safe vaccines out there.  It's all about MONEY.  GREED."
2021-04-23 12:37,Its more than a little ridiculous how some Americans refuse to get vaccinated because a handful of people developed blood clots or because they don't think it will be effective on Covid variants while completely ignoring the over half million people who've died from Covid.
2021-04-23 12:48,"I got the J&J vaccine and am fine. With recent articles about boosters for Pfizer and Moderna, I am wondering what that means for the smaller fraction of people who have gotten J&J. Will we need boosters, is J&J working on one, and, if so, if you are a woman under 50 like I am, what might that mean if the vaccine is re-instated? Could you get a booster of an mRNA vaccine if you had J&J before?"
2021-04-23 12:16,"7 million shots, 6 cases with 1 death...all in all that's actually pretty good numbers. 
Women who take birth control face the possibility of blood clots and don't get as good a chance as not to get them. For some women who take the pill, the odds are 1 out of 10,000 will develop a blood clot. 
( <a href=""https://health.clevelandclinic.org/yes-your-birth-control-could-make-you-more-likely-to-have-a-blood-clot"" target=""_blank"">https://health.clevelandclinic.org/yes-your-birth-control-could-make-you-more-likely-to-have-a-blood-clot</a>/) 
They haven't paused those or made a big deal about it.
The difference is that this vaccine is something new and the powers that be are being overly cautious. While it looks good in one way, it also doesn't. For those looking for any reason to cause discontent about the vaccines, this is way for them to do that. Using false narratives.
Look, all the vacciness were approved under emergency basis. They were tested under a short program and not under the years long one that most go through before being approved. Our country might have more drugs available if not for that. There are lots of drugs available in Europe but not here, for that reason. The bureaucracy that is the FDA."
2021-04-23 14:00,My only concern about the J&J vaccine is where it will now be manufactured. Emergent clearly isn’t safe.
2021-04-22 9:58,"“...,if pain never quite goes away, then neither does love.”. 

I lost my mother unexpectedly nearly 8 years ago while serving abroad and not getting to say goodbye to her led to prolonged grieving that affected me in ways I never imagined.  On Monday, I will celebrate what would have been her 76 birthday with so much love and gratitude in my heart. The pain is still present, but the love today is even greater, perhaps, than when she was alive."
2021-04-22 10:42,"Isn’t it interesting how frequently the physical impact of grief is found in the cardiovascular system?  And how completely that aligns with our grief perception of what we experience, a broken heart?"
2021-04-22 10:54,"I realized a few years ago that part of the problem with grieving is the notion that the pain of loss is bad. It's just suffering. Imagining  it is a bad thing makes it lodge inside instead of letting it pass through and go. How to say this in a way that makes sense? We are taught to be afraid of death and loss, but I found when I was actually in the room, at the bedside, when the person I loved died, the experience was similar to being at the bedside for birth. Only at birth and death are we so close to where we come from and go to. It affords a view of life that is otherwise obscured, what Wordsworth alludes to in ""Intimations of Immortality."""
2021-04-22 11:26,"I am wondering if this science is applicable to those coming to terms with their own self due to a chronic, debilitating disease. Thinking of a young friend who has lost so much of who she is ..."
2021-04-22 11:44,"It has been a horrid year. I was not personally infected with COVID19, but some of my close friends were. Their struggle with the illness was hard to witness.  I took all precautions and though I didn’t get sick, I was stressed and grief stricken. I thought I would get through it though. 
     Then last December my 83 year old mother fell on the ice in the driveway and fractured a vertebrae.  She also continued down the slope of dementia. Now she cannot drive, use a phone, or communicate effectively. She doesn’t understand much of anything. She is alive, but not present. She is no longer my mother. I have lost her. 

     Then last month, when I turned 60, I was diagnosed with cancer for the third time in my life.  I have decided not to fight it, and request palliative care only. I have no partner, no children, no siblings to be concerned about, my father died in 1999, now my mother is cared for but lost to me, and I have no other family or close friends. 
I’ve had a hard life. I am grieving. I am tired. I just want to go to sleep. 

    I did not get sick with COVID19, but this year killed me anyway."
2021-04-22 11:48,"Thank you so much for this article.

In late 2020, I had unplanned surgery for my suddenly very symptomatic (again) endometriosis and then, about a month later, my younger brother died suddenly at age 27. (He died from a heart attack, likely brought on by years of anti-psychotics prescribed for his Autism spectrum disorder with high support needs. I still wonder of Covid was involved as well.)

I am the type of person who can’t really metabolize anything without reading about what others have gone through, and I only wish this article had come sooner (Thankfully it is here for the next person who needs it!). I can’t even describe the way his death bowled me over physically when combined with the inflammatory pain of my endometriosis and its requisite surgery. It was actual, physical pain, and I think that years of chronic illness have predisposed my body to respond in this way. I could read a lot about others’ emotions, but I didn’t see the physical fallout described anywhere. Hopefully the research described in the article represents a start to our normalizing of this kind of experience.

I also wanted to note, since this seems like a good place, that what also came roaring back was my suicidal ideation I had not experienced since I was a teenager. I learned this is fairly normal — especially as part of the “bargaining” stage (“take me instead”) — but it was extremely acute and alarming. I wonder if this is physiological as well.

To all my fellows in grief, take care <3"
2021-04-22 11:55,I have always wondered about how grief affects the body. Now I see how complex it can be.  And how important it is for caring others to think of these physical manifestations as well.
2021-04-22 11:54,Grief is a solitary thing without feathers. No soaring. No gliding. No ornament.
2021-04-22 11:02,"“Humans are predisposed to form loving bonds,” Dr. O’Connor said. All sentient beings form loving bonds, both human and non human animals. Imagine the levels of stress, depression, fear and grief of animals bred for human consumption. Trillions of animals suffering annually. Then apply all those stress hormones to humans ingesting them. Major diseases and broken hearts are intertwined among all living sentient beings. That’s one enormous cycle humans can eliminate by being vegan. Take grief and heart break off the menu and off your plate."
2021-04-22 12:03,"I know now due to experience that I do react physically to grief, The first time was at the year anniversary of my fathers death, I was surprised how calm I was. Within a week I could not move my arm. I had been very active but the pain was extreme. While I was getting physical therapy the therapist was talking about the meridian points and the connection to the lungs and to grief..and I burst into tears. I suddenly realized my grief had been internalized not non existent. The same thing happened this fall when a dear friend unexpectedly died. The grief was all encompassing including the loss of the use of my arm. Maybe that's where that expression ""the loss was like losing a limb"". Love and loss is indeed an intense physical thing."
2021-04-22 12:23,"Thank you for this article, Ann. Grief is a huge subject, often rooted, as you say, in the experience of shock. With grief, shock is both acute and chronic. As a classically trained acupuncturist in practice for 30 years now, I have treated countless patients successfully through their experiences of grief. Acupuncture is a medical modality that addresses the interconnections between mind and emotion - the preview of psychology  - and physiology - the preview of medicine - with sophistication and insight. And, unlike either psychology or western medicine, acupuncture can 'do something'. It can change or rebalance the impact of shock on our systems, step by step. 

I am amazed that science journalists still turn to studies in western medicine or psychology in these kind of articles as their 'source' of information without looking at the assumptions - or biases - that  each of these valuable disciplines bring to the discussion. Neither is fundamentally rooted in an ability to understand these interconnections. The medical discipline of acupuncture understands and works across these disciplines with ease. It does so, because it works with a very sophisticated understanding of energy - which underlies both mind and emotion and physiology. Perhaps someday science journalists will consider acupuncture a valid source of information about health and well being. 

I would recommend all your readers suffering from grief to consider acupuncture treatment. It helps."
2021-04-22 12:35,"Or only child, a son, died 10 years ago at 25. One might think the pain has lessened. Not always so. While we learn to grieve in our own ways the 10 year anniversary was particularly difficult. Many factors came into play as we see friends and family lives move on with children growing, marrying, starting families, building new memories, etc. No, this is not jealousy, rather our memories stopped 10 years ago with new memories built on the pain of tragedy. Watching the lives of others grow is not sad, we love to see it bloom and experience their joy vicariously. But there are times we stop and reflect on what might have been and the emotions rush back as do some very painful memories in the middle of the night. But that is what grieving is and why it doesn’t end.

You don’t “move on”. You just learn to deal with it day by day. We are leading a good life; we love each other, are fortunate in many ways and have much to be thankful. It’s just not the same life, whatever that life would have brought us.  We are a couple and family is so different."
2021-04-22 12:40,"I’ve wondered why the pain continues so long.  Aeschylus said, “Even in our sleep, pain which cannot forget falls drop by drop upon the heart until, in our own despair, against our will, comes wisdom through the awful grace of God.”

I’m not overtly religious, but there came a point for me many years after my father passed, when - the best way to say it - ‘I understood’ and the pain was replaced by comfort.

For your life has lived in me,
your laugh once lifted me,
your word was gift to me.
To remember this brings painful joy..."
2021-04-22 12:42,"I'm so sorry for the losses and grief shared here, in the article and the comments. I think there will be a nationwide reckoning, once we are less in ""survival mode"", for which we are ill-prepared.

Separately, I've had family members experience a very particular physical response to grief, called ""broken heart syndrome"", or stress cardiomyopathy, which may be related to surging stress hormones. Luckily, most people survive that, and my relatives did."
2021-04-22 12:45,My mother died in the beginning of the pandemic when lockdowns and travel restrictions made a funeral and gathering in person impossible. I said goodbye over Facetime. Having someone you love so much die without any of the rituals and physical comfort of being with family and friends has been such a lonely experience. The other thing about the pandemic is that it was hard to distract oneself from the grief... you were just sitting there with it day after day. We are finally gathering - over a year later - for a memorial service with family finally safe enough to fly and see each other in person.
2021-04-22 12:54,"At some point scientists, governments and industry will have to decide do they want robots or do they want humans. And just like with the atom bomb, my fear is some excuse like “ the Russians, the Chinese, and other bad actors, have the science and the capabilities of curing...,” therefore we need to be ahead of them.” Because so much money is involved, Pharma would love to invent another pill to make grieving go away, and because research careers need constant money, artificial intelligence and the genetic sequencing project will ensure we continue to lean towards continuing to make a mess of the planet.
And if we completely understand the biology of grief and trauma, then what? Another pill, more shock therapy, more trans cranial stimulation?
Since the Pharma, MD’s and psychiatry’s lobbying industry is far more awash in dollars that Social Work, and National  Educators Association, I can guarantee that any understanding of how our thoughts, feelings and actions are integrated into our brain, will result in trickle down meds from Pharma, more EST and trans cranial stimulation, and not to providing a more humane home and work environment that people need in order to not be traumatized by life’s events. 
Agony and pain due to one of our life cycle’s, can be instructive and useful, unless you live in a culture that tells you just have another drink, or pop another pill."

Indeed."
2021-04-22 13:02,"My favorite doctor at The Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, a healer and a friend, died in a tragic accident while on vacation taking a photo of one of the beautiful spots he loved to photograph and that he shared on a global platform as a kind of antidote to some of the pain and suffering he saw. He was a loved one in a different sense and his loss isn’t like what I experienced when my parents died and I’m sure doesn’t compare to the loss of a child. Still I appreciated this story because it explains why I feel the pain in my body. I don’t know if it helps or hurts to keep sharing a smiling selfie he took of us. He helped me when I was near death, just with his smile, and every time I think of him I cry. It’s just been a couple of weeks and my therapist friend says I need to cry but our society is so much about stiff upper lip that I fight it. I don’t think I will say how he died because the visual is too upsetting. (Francisco Marty , an renowned infectious disease specialist, only 53... anyone who wanted to could of course look it up.) It’s not right to compare it to the loss of a relative but the only way it could be harder is that you are supposed to cry over the loss of a relative but people think you’re odd (or maybe I think I’m odd) to be crying over a doctor."
2021-04-22 13:10,"When Tom, my companion of 40 years, died in 2007, early on I began going through papers, photographs, manuscripts, letters, all sorts of things the departed leaves behind. Much had to be tossed, and I thought it was my job to do so and not leave that task for anyone else. He was a packrat, so there was a lot of stuff.  The photos I felt I should keep, organizing them as best I could. I am a task-oriented person, and these were tasks that had to be accomplished. 

And they were. Clothing to the VA. 10 large boxes from his movie publicity days to the Museum of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. Letters home from WW2 to the Veterans Memoir collection of the Library of Congress. Much simply got tossed out.

But more important that a task being done was the effect on me. This process meant reviewing our whole life together, not focusing on the sad and unpleasant stuff at the end. This was crucial to my healing.

Unlike Ms. Finkbeiner's own experience, this death was not sudden, not unexpected. Tom's wishes involving end-of-life care were clear and clearly documented, and the only choice his physicians and I had to make was to follow those wishes. And we did.

Death is, so far, universal, something that we will each experience. And each death is singular to those left behind. Responses will differ. They can't help do so. Yet I think that what I learned by trial and error, by doing, might have something universal about it. Focus on the life, not the death. It respects. It heals."
2021-04-22 13:34,"I am struck by how the author, and most of the commenters, believe that ""[real] grief"" only visits those who have lost a relationship through death.  There is no mention of love lost when one person in a relationship decides to move on, or when a friendship ends; in some ways, these situations are worse, because the element of rejection is yet another blow to the psyche.  Having endured such losses, I can attest that there is little societal empathy for us - After all, there is no body!  No one died, pick yourself up and get moving again! - although I am sure that clinical psychologists will attest that we also suffer.  It's time to enlarge our notion of bereavement, because it surrounds us every day - if only we open our eyes and hearts."
2021-04-22 13:47,"Our youngest child died ten years ago when she was about to turn 13 from a brain tumor.  A friend recently said to me that he ""thought I was fine now, because that's what I project"".  Which is all true; grieving people work so hard to appear ""fine"".  I still dream about our daughter, all kinds of dreams, nice ones but mostly dreams where I am hoping she is not going to die or that I can somehow make it not happen.  I work full time and although as a counselor myself I would say I am living by trying to be open to so much beauty and love and joy, but also still deeply missing our daughter.  My main purpose in posting was that I think the concept of complicated grief is not accurate to many people's experience of grief; it was 5 years before I begin to feel the weight of my grief to be bearable, and our love for those we've lost isn't somehow unsuccessful grieving.
I think the link between the physical impact and grief is very important to acknowledge and study; I'm just disappointed to see the complicated grief terminology."
2021-04-22 13:51,"Info like this is sooo important. As always there will be differences in opinion but I am one who apparently has been impacted by the physical calamities of grief. My dad died in 2010, my husband in 2012 & my mom in 2014. I also moved in 2016, packing & unpacking by myself. Definitely a situation of getting up only to be knocked down again & again. In 2016 I was diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis after not feeling right for a very long time. I asked 2 Drs. if the onset could have been caused by my the grief of my losses. One said yes to the grief & the other blamed the physical stress of my move. Personally I’m going with a combo of the two. The stress continues into this year because I am taking 3 immunosuppressant therapies & there is a lack of evidence thus far on the efficacy of the vaccine in people like me. Time will tell but the stress is ongoing even tho I am aware of the damage caused by it :(  
I cross my fingers that the Covid stress abates due to vaccine success for me...think positive I tell myself, POSITIVE!"
2021-04-22 14:01,"After my husband died suddenly and unexpectedly in 2016, I remember trying to keep up with daily routines, which included exercise. I'm a fairly fit person, but I remember once becoming physically exhausted after walking at a slow pace for five minutes. So the cardiovascular effects of grief described here make perfect sense to me. Normally a voracious reader, I couldn't focus on anything. And while I was able to 'function' soon after his death (hold down a job, deal with all the legal stuff, etc), it was at least two years before I approached anything like a feeling of normalcy."
2021-04-22 14:03,"My daughter developed intractable epilepsy two years after the death of her younger brother, to whom she was closer than to anyne else on earth.  And in each seizure, she replays a memory of him as a little boy, running across a field.  It is almost like a movie than has to be seen, over and over again.  All the members of my family have suffered physical effects since his death,but hers is the most dramatic."
2021-04-22 14:04,"My spouse died of Alzheimer's disease.  The grieving process for me started a couple of years before he died. Witnessing the progressive devastation of dementia to his personality and physical being was so heartbreaking.  One of the physical manifestations of my grief was developing hyperthyroidism.  I believe that the intense stress that I experienced during the last two years of my husband's life triggered this response. Now (three years later), I'm off the medication, and my thyroid function back to normal. During the pandemic, I have often thought of those families who were not able to be with their dying loved ones.  One of my most cherished memories is the last week of my husband's life.  My son and I stayed at his side -- talking with him, singing to him, playing his favorite music, and holding him.  Goodbyes are important to the grieving process.  I ache for those who longed for that opportunity and were not able to have it."
2021-04-22 14:09,"Ever since my mother’s death from cancer in 1997, I have experienced an ache in the crook of my left arm when I am grieving her.  The ache also surfaces when I view mothers with their children, leading me to recognize that my mysterious “grief alarm” is actually a bodily manifestation of love, not loss.  Of course the two go hand in hand."
2021-04-22 14:20,"I lost my husband of 27 years in 2013.  The Grieving process was hard for me because I’m a very verbal person and I needed to talk about it.  I felt like I was having a surreal out of body experience, and so much stress. I felt electricity shooting out of my wrists.￼￼￼ I found myself stunned and realizing I’ve been sitting there for several minutes￼I was afraid of wearing out my friends because of my need for someone to talk to!!  The second and third year after his death were harder than the first year.  ￼￼ First year you’re in shock￼.  Nobody really wants to hear about your grief, and our culture really doesn’t have accepted ways of dealing with it.￼￼
A Big loss is the sense of touch￼.  Humans are tactile creatures.  And losing that ability to touch another human being￼￼￼ is ￼ devastating or stressful or whatever words you can come up with.￼￼. 
I had a good grievance counselor Through our hospice ￼and she warned me about the possible Health affects.  Too bad my physician did Not warn me about the side effects of discontinuing the SNRI Pristiq after I took it for six months. ￼￼￼ I ended up in the ER when I came off Pristiq because I had symptoms of a stroke.  
   Grief is very complicated and each individual processes it in a different way.￼￼ 
Loss is a big part of life that people want to avoid discussing.  The medical profession should be studying it!!￼"
2021-04-22 14:23,"Great article! Neurochemistry is an physical as the rest of our bodies.  Society acknowledges some losses as losses, but not others. The body remembers what the mind can't describe or process."
2021-04-22 14:23,"I hope I’m not preaching to the choir, but I rely upon certain things which offer healing:  singing, visual art, and free-form dance.  All of these activities can be done solo. 

Singing:  in the shower, or a parked car.
Drawing and painting:  it doesn’t matter if you’re “good”. Even scribbling will release energy. 
Dancing:  make sure to hydrate and give yourself space. Then, let loose.

Even when I don’t feel motivated to do the above, if I commit myself to the task, there’s nearly always a bit of transformation... it’s the processing of things unseen."
2021-04-22 14:31,My beautiful niece was killed in a car wreck 8 years ago.  I have never been the same since.    Physically the first years my skin fell like it was crawling and peeling off.    I lost 25-30 pounds.   I could barely function outside of the house for about a year.     Lots of other things but I am surviving.    That is why they say survived by in the obituary because surviving is about all I did for the first few years.
2021-04-22 14:37,"Thank you so much for this article. When illness follows hard on the heels of loss, one is tempted to think of it as yet one more thing to trouble us at a time when we are particularly low. We use phrases such as ‘broken hearted’ thinking it is just a phrase.
Scientists can describe the biochemistry of each cell in our bodies but so little is known about how our emotions flood through us and become embedded in all those chemical pathways, affecting everything from breathing to digestion to heart rate and more, with longer term effects.
It is comforting then to know, in the midst of our grief, that we are not alone in having significant physical impacts, that this may well be part of the grieving process, that we must look after ourselves as best we can at a time when we don’t much care about anything. It’s important to realize too that although grief is at its worst because of the loss of a loved one, it can also come from other losses, a home, a pet, a job. But we are also astonishingly resilient; even when we don’t know it, we are often finding ways to heal ourselves."
2021-04-22 14:38,"My father, my son, and my only sibling (and ultimately, resultantly, statistically predictably) my marriage all died within four years of each other when I was in my late-twenties, early-thirties. As the therapist I sought out so aptly described, it was like bumping a hanging potted plant and at the point when it re-settled, hitting it again. I developed chronic inflammation in my right, dominant wrist to which three different medical specialists could neither provide a diagnosis or plan of treatment other than prednisone. The condition persisted for nearly a decade and then just as inexplicably abated. I would truly like to see more research into the connection between inflammatory disorders and grief."
2021-04-22 14:43,"I lost my mother two years ago to cancer. I lost my father in February to cancer exacerbated by Covid. A year prior, my husband of twenty years unexpectedly left me and my teenage son. The grief I feel for my parents is huge but manageable. The grief I feel for the loss of my husband is acute. I’ve received much support and care for the loss of my parents. Divorce? I’m a pariah.

Would that people understood the sadness and depression I experience around the loss of my spouse is as bottomless as losing a parent. 

It’s actually worse."
2021-04-22 15:06,"Not all grief is the same.  Some losses can be worked through and integrated over time; other losses are impossible.  For instance, the loss of an only beloved child to suicide versus loss of a 90 year old parent due to natural causes precipitate very different grief reactions.  The former is unrelenting and life shattering; the latter is manageable over time.  I experienced both of these losses in late 2020, in quick succession--my 22 yr old son died by suicide and then my mother passed away 3 weeks later after making a well-informed and clear decision to move to hospice. Losing my son has ruined me forever; losing my mother makes me very sad and I miss her a lot, but I can accept that it was her time to leave us. The term ""grieving process"" is bewildering as it implies there is a way of proceeding, when in some cases, such as when a middle aged person loses an only child (especially to suicide), it is just a perpetual state of being. No ""healing"" or ""recovering"" is possible. Western society is all about moving forward, getting better, moving on, putting pain behind us, etc. and no one knows how to help when these things are not possible--you are just damaged goods, pitied. I have surely learned who my friends are through this. Research on grief biology should take account of the magnitude of the loss in addition to factors related to the bereaved, such as age/life stage, social supports, relationship status, religious/spiritual beliefs, SES, etc."
2021-04-22 15:22,"After the sudden accidental death of my sister, I developed a very extreme form of chronic hives: two or three times a day for a period of about 8 months I would develop flushes of hives with overlapping welts and my skin was very swollen.  It started on her funeral and barely improved with the cocktails of antihistamines and corticosteroids I was given. The itch occupied my mind leaving little time to grieve or cry.  
The hives stopped months later when I became pregnant with my daughter.  Either pregnancy hormones reset my histamine production to normal levels or the joy of becoming a first time mom overcame the sadness of loosing my sister."
2021-04-22 15:38,"I'm so sorry for your own loss, Ann, and so grateful for your article. 

A few years ago, I lost six close friends in less than 18 months, including the friend who'd been by my side after my best friend had dropped dead of aneurysm. A year after that horrible streak, I had a heart attack. It makes more sense now. 

One thing that complicates grieving is that we don't have a word for surviving the loss of the most-important-person-in-your-life who isn't a romantic partner. Few people have understood the inconsolable loneliness of losing my best friend, although they'd grasp it immediately if I could describe myself as his widow."
2021-04-22 15:51,"Grief isn't just about death. Grief can be strong around other life events, especially if unexpected - the loss of a job, the estrangement of a family member, or a breakup. I would say that anything that causes a person to lose their sense of identity, status or purpose can be cause for grief. And this article is correct - there are physical as well as emotional consequences."
2021-04-22 15:55,"I lost my beloved pet after a brief, but intense period of physical degradation, which was shocking to see and difficult to manage. I was scared by my physical response and scared by the intensity: heart palpitations, poor sleep and ptosis. Had to look it up - one of my eyelids looked visibly enlargd and more droopy than the other. Not to mention the bags that appeared under my eyes overnight.
It's been 6 weeks and the symptoms improved, but I was quite concerned."
2021-04-22 16:00,"In the 1960s, two families close to ours lost their college-age daughters in a tragic plane crash. It was a devastating loss for the parents and siblings. One father, a physician, later died from a brain tumor. The other dad developed early dementia, before we knew it as Alzheimer’s disease, in his early fifties. I always felt that overwhelming grief contributed to their brain diseases. My heart still hurts when I think about it."
2021-04-22 16:02,"Wonderful, thought-provoking article. The book ""Levels of Life"" by Julian Barnes helped me with the ""madness"" of grief when my husband died. I had the experience of walking up a flight of steps behind a couple and he said something to her and touched her hand to attract her attention. I felt an overwhelming urge to shout at the couple: ""Don't do that--don't you know what it will be like when one of you dies?"" That was when I realized I had ""gone mad."" The book helped me a lot. It was a safe space within which I could read, over and over again, about the experience and the madness of grief. Perhaps it will help others as well."
2021-04-22 16:05,"While on vacation in Europe two years ago, an enormously happy time bringing my son, his wife, and our two granddaughters, one from his brother's twin, on the fourth day of our trip, we got a text from my 8 year old granddaughter saying, ""Daddy is in a coma."" I became frantic and my husband tried calling my daughter-in-law who went to check on him. It was too late. He passed from an Addison's Crisis. There is no loss worse than that of a child no matter the age or the cause. Almost two years later and my grief has not changed. Time does not heal. I found my hair thinned out, my eye problems became worse, chronic aches in my body in places I hadn't had any, and several other ailments I will not mention. Ann Finkbeiner, I absolutely share your grief and I believe with all my heart that grieving can have devastating effects on the body. I hope you stay strong and keep that place in your heart for your son. My only consolation is that this happened to me late in life, and that I won't be grieving as long as some."
2021-04-22 16:43,"Thank you for this article, Ann. I am so sorry for your loss. I cannot imagine the pain of losing an 18 year old child. I appreciate that you found the courage to use your grief to help others with theirs. It is helpful to understand that we do have physical reactions to major stressors in our lives, including grief. 

It seems to me that a large part of the physical and emotional pain is that it is often not acknowledged in our society. We are expected to move on and get back to normal. Some societies have anniversaries to remember loved ones who have passed away. The grief is shared even years afterwards. It is considered a part of life, not something to recover from. 

I understand that loss and grief are part of everyone's life, but so often we are left to deal with it alone. Thank you for this article which helps us to discuss grief in a different way, so that we can all learn better how to live with it as part of our lives."

Losing my father age 45, exacerbation of mild rheumatoid arthritis to the point where joints were noticeably swollen and puffy for a year. Chronic anemia and low white blood cell count since then (5 years).

2021-04-22 12:45,"I talk to the dead. I am told, it is unseemly and it upsets people. I am told, it makes me look crazy. You can't talk to the dead because people are listening. You can't talk to the dead because they cannot hear you and you must be mad. You can't talk to the dead because they want to be alone. I am deranged. Absurd. Ridiculous. What the living do not understand (they should hear themselves) is that the dead talk back. My biggest challenge in life is to simply survive. From one moment to the next. Survival is not what you will find at the end of a tunnel. I write to tend to pain. I write to tend to the hate friends and family say they have for me. I am alone, but I fight, and fight, and fight. The only weapon I have against hatred is defiance. If I take the defiant armor off, it's endurance I want to wear. The dead agree. Grief is okay, but it's a broken record. Survival is okay, but it's a broken contract. Religion is okay, but they want your broken soul. In grief, I will be overwhelmed, and unable to function. Life is okay, but it's overrated, and the living will break you because they break everything. I ride a dirt bike, and it's safer than grief. I ride past grief, and it's not unlike passing by a telephone pole. The only phone in this house is in my pocket. Grief is as outdated as a telephone pole. It's about survival. Not grief. I have traveled through many sandstorms. They will whip you. They will turn you around. They will wound you with sand between your teeth. Weep."

    Just saying."
2021-04-22 12:56,"Thanks for this timely, important article, Ms. Finkbeiner.

I want to share from my experiences of loss, and hopefully it won’t be preachy. Many times, our conscience mind might not fully engage in our loss, and this can be protective... oddly, it can help us get through another day. Even when our loss presents us with a numbed-out mind, our deeper intuition signals trouble. If we approach this gently, we can express these complex energies. This processing of grief can reveal itself in many forms, yet I’ve found certain things which offer tangible healing. 

- Dancing, free style. No partner needed. Give yourself lots of space, and comfortable clothing.
- Singing, for yourself. This is not a performance. You can even do this while sitting (parked) in your car or in the shower. It does not matter how “good” your voice is. But if your over-exert yourself, you will strain your voice. 
- Visual art can release us from the linear nature of “time”.  If you feel you “can’t draw”, even if you scribble, it will release energy. The more you let go of all self-judgement, you will become freer. 

One more thing:  even when you’re in a deep funk, and don’t feel “motivated”, if you commit yourself to a healing exercise, it can indeed offer benefits."

2021-04-22 14:08,"This grief time line is ridiculous. Ten months and then you are told 'complicated grief?""
Grief is love, and the love is forever. This is a pain that never goes away, ever, and labels and cultural expectations are cruel and to be ignored.  The term complicated grief implies that opps...you failed at grieving.  You got stuck. People who are grieving do not need judgmental labels."
2021-04-22 15:07,"I thought my husband's death would be the worst grief I would ever experience. I was wrong. Grief over the devastating loss of a later love  can be equally if not more severe. With death, it's final and there was love to the end. In a breakup you are dead to the person no longer in your life but he is still alive. He or she is dead to you--but not by your choice. The effects can be as acute and physical as those accompanying grief over death. Healing requires a different set of skills."
2021-04-22 15:14,"In the end Finkbeiner captures what I see as the truth about our grief. We may and likely will never be 'comfortable with our loss/grief. We become less spun by it daily but it is there. Always there. My memoir of Donna, my writing, Podcast, and work in the grief community help me to be at one with my loss. Comfortable? Meh

I know for me me as I continue and write more about Donna, my loss, our love, and my grief. It has taken on the form of wound. A wound that lets light and knowledge in where I learn and am filled with gratitude for all that Donna gave me. She loved me into being. I have that knowledge to use and share with others in my grief community on their grief journey and work. 

My ideation can be out of control at times and be ever so present. Yet I live with that until Donna and I are together again. I only suffer knowing that who I have become though her love and my loss she will never benefit from. Others may and that is okay."
2021-04-23 3:05,"So many moving stories here. Thank-you all.

Grief in many forms. One, losing my only sibling to suicide when he was thirty-two. Now, nineteen years in the past, recently my daughter’s friend’s sister died at twenty-five due to a drug overdose. Instant replay, this death caused me to relive the grief of my brother’s death. So many years later. Two tragic deaths. I was shocked to revisit this pain.
My mother’s death at ninety-two years. Too many years in an old age home and a mother-daughter relationship often fraught with difficulties. Her death was a relief, even cause for celebration. Forgiveness now an easier path.
Two deaths and the repercussions of both so different."
2021-04-23 7:35,"We lost our 30-year-old son seven months ago so this article caught my eye. 

I suppose I still have that subconscious idea that this is a journey which will have an end, though I'm learning hour-by-hour that that isn't the case at all. I keep searching for someone to tell me how my pain will change but, of course, no one can do that. 

The brain is an incredible thing in the way it protects us in our fragile state. It released an instant shield of denial from the moment the police on the doorstep said my son's name. I'd like to say it here, his name was Will."
2021-04-23 13:21,"I lost my son (my first real love) 15 years ago and my friend sent me this article. The only thing that helps me is to try to help other grieving parents. 2 years ago I wrote and illustrated a grief support book specifically for parents. A year later, when I heard people were giving it to other's grieving losses other then children I decided to write another one for a more general audience, also fully illustrated (art has saved me) They can be found on my books website; www.claudiachappel.com Take a look, these books are very special."
2021-04-24 14:11,"I think grief would be better understood if we stopped quantifying loss based on the status - spouse, child, parent, friend - of the loved one who's gone, as if pain can be gauged in such unfair measurements. I cannot know what it's like to lose a child or sibling. But I know what it's like to lose both parents, other relatives, friends and my spouse of 38 years. Each blow was crippling, the worst the loss of my boon companion four years ago. How can I say my grief is harder to bear than someone else's? I can't. Grief is at the root a solitary, personal experience. We can share our feelings about it with others who may or may not have experienced loss, and that helps, but in the end we bear it alone.

It would also be helpful if more attention was paid to the ancillary losses that death brings: the losses of home life, friendships, the uprooting of self that grief often results in. We mourn these losses almost as much as the physical ones, yet little is said or written about them."

There's some heaviness and sorrow in my chest when I see him on my phone  or some accidental reference that jolts me with his permanent absence.

2021-04-25 4:11,"When I separated 4 years ago, I discovered the ex had been slowly, and surely turning our three children against me for years (something he also did with other friends and family). 

My two youngest children, age 15 and 17, went for ""a visit"" to an acquaintance in town and never returned. The ex and the acquaintance conspired to prevent me from exercising my court ordered visitation (he openly admitted this). One of the only two times I saw my youngest daughter that year, she admitted that the acquaintance openly hated and derogated me to my girls, and made them fear me. By Christmas 2017, that child was no longer speaking to me and has not made contact since. The middle child, when she contacts me is openly hostile and hateful. She never contacts me for any reason except to demand money.

The first few months, I couldn't eat. I had to force myself to have one meal a day, as my body melted away. For the first year, I alternated between overflowing with sorrow and rage. During the second year, I began to function slightly better. In the 3rd year, I could make jokes about how debilitated I was. It is only now in the 4th year I can begin to say things like, ""my kids are grown,""  and, ""empty nest,"" when folks ask if I have kids. 

The pain never goes away. There is no such thing as ""moving on.""  I just got used to hurting. No, the girls are not dead. Yes, I still have some contact with the oldest. But I am a mother who is not a mother. 

I grieve because the loss is ongoing."

But I can imagine nothing worse than losing one of my precious children or grandchildren.  I can only imagine your grief, a grief that is unnatural.  Parents are not supposed to survive their children.  I have read their is no word in any language to describe such a phenomenon.  In any case,  although your story was heartbreaking, thank you for sharing."
2021-04-26 10:11,"Thank you for a very thoughtful and informative and sensitive article and for sharing your own experience of losing your son.

I hypothesize that the ""Grief"" of death is different depending on the relationship.

A death of a child is the most stressful because humans evolved to protect and raise their children to adults even if having to give their own life to achieve that outcome.   When a child dies, all of our defenses are not present because of the mostly unexpected and unacceptable outcome for the child.    Recovering from the loss of a child is truly, profoundly difficult and some people never do.   Perhaps most never fully recovery from the loss of a child.

However, the loss of a parent is very different.   Humans have evolved in a context of parental loss for their entire existence.   Losing a parent is, mostly, not difficult to manage or deal with as it is encoded in our DNA as a natural, normal outcome of life.   Of course, an eight year old child who loses a parent and has no other support after the parent's death will have a hard time with survival, and, a hard time with loss.   But, that outcome is, although not completely common, not uncommon either.    People recover.

Brothers as sisters are complex.   I am not sure how humans are wired to handle this, but, it is much, much more manageable than a child.  

Indeed, I hypothesize that, of all deaths, ONLY a child's is something that brings profound, long lasting effects.

Death is a part of life.  We know it."

As I turn my face to the sun I hear her laugh, her voice rising and falling in the melody of her native land, the English a constructed sound for her.  As we pause on the trail she grasps my hand and turning to me - she ever so gently kisses my cheek and giggles. 

I open my eyes as my gazes shifts away from the sun, and she isn’t there..... I am alone in the forest with only the sounds of the wind and forest.  She ......

And then the ground falls away and I’m falling again.  Always backwards, grasping for a handhold, to catch a toe on solid ground as I fly into the abyss once again... the sun fading.  Today I may fall again, how far and when it stops, I know not."

I experience grief every day for the loss of our marriage relationship to the disease. Even after a year and a half, the house is strangely empty and I see and feel her former presence every day. There are many of us out there, spouses grieving the loss of a spouse who is still alive. I visit daily and help with her care. I look forward to these visits and dread them at the same time. There is no closure, and I dread what the future holds as she continues to decline. During her last year at home the stress of caregiving was overwhelmingly and I hoped for a sense of relief when she moved to care. Wrong. The stress of caregiving has been replaced by a roller coaster of grief than constantly rises and subsides. I hope this doesn’t sound too whiny and negative, it is just the reality of being an Alzheimer’s spouse. I am frustrated because I try my hardest to learn about coping mechanisms and dealing with loss, but I am not making much headway. Covid has made this process worse: no family can visit and social isolation is definitely not a tool to relieve grief! If you have a friend or relative who is an Alzheimer caregiver, reach out and support them. Grief arises from situations of loss, not just from death."
2021-04-26 11:17,"I lost my son unexpectedly nearly 4 years ago. Although I don't have ""complicated grief,"" he is like my heartbeat.  When I am busy, with others, distracted, I don't notice it.  When I am alone or quiet, I am aware of my heartbeat and my loss."
2021-04-26 11:28,"Though there are shared experiences (the good and bad) that can lead to interesting studies, every individual is completely unique and so a cataclysmic event to cause a particularly intense grief would cause vastly different damage across a wide ranging time spectrum. You can’t really come to any time-span conclusion how a particular person will be impacted by a life event to cause intense grief; each individual will have their own time. The article seems to have 6-12 months as some marker and that seems about right but only for a loss that wasn’t unexpected such as a parent who had been sick for some time or a break up that obviously needed to happen. A sudden death of an extremely important person in life that takes years to process. I know some people caught off guard by a spouse leaving them they never really recovered or it took close to a decade."
2021-04-26 11:39,"I agree with the posters below, you don’t “get over loss”, you sort of get used to it.
 I lost my love, my best friend and wife to cancer about three years ago and my grieving goes on.
I accept it, and I am learning to live with it, calling it “complicated” makes me feel as if I am doing something wrong.
As if grief is supposed to be “uncomplicated” and somehow I am missing a step, as if there is some kind of clear path to follow.
I love my wife just as much now as I did then and there is nothing complicated about that."
2021-04-26 11:56,"I've been in a state of shock since my husband of almost 40 years died suddenly and unexpectedly last summer. I was going to write more, but I just can't."
2021-04-26 11:56,"But this is all a very modern view of human grief. Do you think grief is new? Think back to the 1800s. Death was everywhere in people’s lives. Mothers and children died in childbirth regularly. A tetanus infection could be fatal. Industrial accidents, wars, disease, fires. People in that era—in all earlier eras—carried immense grief through their lives. I would say our comparative distance to death and dying has made us less familiar with it, and thus more fearful of it and the grief that comes with it. In our current age of brain science, we seem to think that brain scans will explain it all. And maybe a pill will help us through. We should ask if it’s the grief that is the killer or our efforts to avoid it. Perhaps we should not so strongly desire a life free of emotional pain."
2021-04-26 10:54,"I suspected this: Grief is the reason my routine blood tests & blood pressure have been so *strange*. I didn't want to suggest it to the doctor.  Mainly because I didn't want to go there; to grief. Also, I figured he wouldn't get it.  But now I know that this will eventually subside. I wish everyone in the middle of grief well."
2021-04-26 11:15,"Chinese medicine laid out the functional relationships between grief, the lungs and large intestine, and the skin in the classic texts since 500-300 bce. Western science studies things and fails at elucidating the functional relationship between things. For that, always look to Chinese medicine."
2021-04-26 12:03,"As others mentioned, you never get over it, you get used to it. Over time, the memories fade and you deal with daily life. Some people reinvent themselves others, including me, choose to go back and investigate the good, bad and the ugly. It's not really being stuck in a time warp but rather more like re-reading a favorite novel. Some people never accept the new reality. You can't let the memories paralyze you but you have to deal with them at some level."
2021-04-26 12:10,"This article tells me I'm not the only one amazed by the emotional confusion and physical changes that grief can bring.
My partner of 13 years died of an aggressive and rapid lymphoma last autumn at the age of 68. 
We had too little time to say what needed to be said, to prepare - to brace ourselves - for his death. 
Seven months on, I'm OK, then I'm not, then I'm OK, then I'm not... (""Mommy, why is that man crying at the grocery checkout?"")
Grief has to be the weirdest emotion ever and it's true that no two people's griefs can be the same. It's also true that it can affect survivors' health, mine included. 
I've recently spent more time in the ER and admitted to hospital than in the last 50-odd years, and I'm pretty sure the shockwaves of emotion-chemicals unleashed by grief have played a major role."
2021-04-26 12:14,"I learned about the power of grief as a child. An uncle died as the result of a heart attack. His widow was staying at our house as there was no major hospital in their town. Within hours, she was in the emergency department in extreme pain. The doctors sent her home, after explaining to my mother that it was a physical reaction to grief. Hours later she was back, and had immediate surgery for a perforated bowel. Her emotional pain had nearly destroyed her body."
2021-04-26 12:19,"As one who has read extensively about Queen Victoria, I have come across comments by biographers who dismiss the tremendous grief she endured after the death of her husband Prince Albert as melodramatic and excessive. The descriptions of the physiological and psychological effects of complicated grief in this article aptly describe her experience after her beloved Albert died at 42. 

The differences between how people react to loss need to be understood and respected."
2021-04-26 13:04,I wish there were more study of what grief in childhood does to your body in a long-term way. I appreciate the author’s not accepting the treacly assumption that loss eventually resides comfortably in the heart.
2021-04-26 13:39,"I would like to see more studies.  My husband died from a fall caused by the progression of a neurological disease in September 2020.  It was sudden and unexpected, even though we had been living with the known fatality rate of his disease.

There was a definite turning point several months after he died - I knew I would live.  Up to that point, even though I was healthy, good weight and active, a definite shroud covered me for months, that I couldn’t and didn’t want to shake off.  I felt I understood why people die after losing a spouse.

I kept exercising (thank you Apple Fitness , with your five and ten minute work outs - all I could manage when I began to try and exercise again weeks after his death) and allowing myself to just be.  After four or five months, the shroud became lighter.  My blood pressure went back to normal after being high for the first time ever.  Today I feel I am living with normal risk factors for death for a 65-year-old and I am back on my bicycle.  While I still feel fragile and don’t want to ride much in traffic, I’m out there.

This article helped my understand the physiological process more.  Grief is a real state of being and I can see how people succumb to its hold.  I wish all those grieving the ability to survive it."
2021-04-26 13:41,"I unexpectedly lost both my parents many years ago within 4 months of each other. My mother was my best friend. I am married, have children and a career, but nothing could replace my relationship with my mother.  Over time, I developed vertigo. High blood pressure. Shingles. Eventually after some serious episodes, I was diagnosed with coronary artery disease. I am now a heart patient, in the care of a cardiologist. I was outwardly coping - but internally affected by grief, stress and loss in a very serious way."
2021-04-26 14:51,"I was diagnosed with aFb six months after my husband died. I’m otherwise a healthy person as I exercise regularly, eat mindfully. 13 years after my husband died, I still have aFib. I don’t think we ever get over the death of a loved one. We just learn to live without them."
2021-04-26 15:35,"I lost my brother to cancer 6 years ago. He was 26. A few months after he passed, I developed chronic pain in my right calf. I was in constant pain; it made walking and sleeping difficult and jogging was impossible. I saw many specialists, from neurologists to sports medicine doctors to vascular specialists and more. There was no measurable cause of my pain. I was physically healthy. It wasn't until 3 years later that I read Dr Sarno's book The Mindbody Prescription that I understood that my pain was psychosomatic. My grief over the horrific loss of my brother created my pain. And once I read the book and recognized the problem was psychological, my pain faded away almost overnight. I trained and ran a 5k a few months later. Grief has profound effects on the body. If you or someone you know is grieving, take care of them or yourselves. Losing someone is hard enough without the physical hardships grief can bring."
2021-04-26 16:02,"When I was told that my mother had terminal cancer, I was only in my early 20s. She was my best pal.  At times I could not breathe, I gasped for air. She always took care of herself - exercised, watched her weight, watch what she ate. We always thought my dad would go first - he was much older, was plagued with health issues.

The first 18 months after she died, I saw our family doctor (her doctor as well) almost every month, complaining about a different symptom each time.  Finally after the 5th or 6th visit, I began to apologize for wasting his time.  Gosh, he was so compassionate and kind.  He said to ""see him for anything, any time.  Grief has a way of doing strange things to one's body.  It's better to check them out than to merely dismiss those symptoms.""

Over time, my oddball symptoms did begin to diminish.  But my broken heart was not mending.  Over the next five years, I thought so much about suicide.  I was that lost and heartbroken over my mother's absence.

I honestly believe that had it not been for my husband, I would have been successful in my attempts.  But his love, compassion, understanding and strength pulled me through.

Now, close to 40 yrs of such a beautiful and loving marriage, I worry if he should die before me, will I be able to live on?  I can honestly state that I will see ""My heart ache for him, it long for him, it look for him.”  Our lives have become so intertwined, together we are whole.  The thought of living without him is my biggest fear."
2021-04-26 16:34,"I’ve often said that intense grief changes your DNA. Not a scientific observation, but grief and loss can be so profound that you are changed forever."
2021-04-26 16:45,"The “inflammation markers” are real. My beloved wife died as the result of a freak accident on November 9th, 2016. She was fine that morning of the 8th as we went canvassing for Presidential election votes; by 1:30 AM the next morning she was gone. No warning. About a month later as I was slowly coming to terms with her death, I started experiencing the most agonizingly painful lower back muscle spasms imaginable. There was no discernible cause. This went on for several months, so much so I slept on the floor and had to undergo traction and chiropractic therapy. The spasms gradually lessened, just in time for my older brother to die unexpectedly of a blood clot likely caused by his lung cancer chemotherapy. But no time for more PT; I had his house and a four-car garage to empty (I was the executor) so I think the fact that I was coming to terms with my wife’s death plus the fact I had a mission (I’m a retired Marine) to complete helped me process the grief. By the time my brother’s estate was closed after several months, my oldest brother developed colon and liver cancer and then he died a year later. By that time, I was an expert “at” grief. No muscle spasms, just a realization that grief was a journey the length of which could easily be increased without warning. Physically I’m fine. But it would be interesting to see the physical state of my mind after all of this emotional assault, especially combined with my PTSD from my time in war. Every day is a journey unto itself."
2021-04-26 17:20,"I have worked in hospice for many years and have been an RN for 41 years now. I have seen so much death, so much pain. I still am bereaved from my own parent’s deaths and from deaths of friends and family members. And pets. There is no escaping loss. There is no definitive way that we should grieve or a timeframe. But yet society tells us to move on. To not be sad. That there is closure. And I think this is what I hear most: no one allows us to be sad, to feel loss. So we must endure privately grieving. If we tell people too much, they avoid us. If we tell an MD, they want to drug us. Good counseling is hard to find. Most suffer in silence. 

Everyone suffers loss. There is no comparing loss. My loss feels different than yours. And yours to mine. 

We shouldn’t have to hide our grief. But we do. I think that is why it shows up in our bodies. There is no treatment for grief; it is part of our life. It is not something we can prepare for nor avoid. I wish I had answers, but I do not. It’s just plain hard."
2021-04-26 17:34,"In 1969, my senior year of High School, just before Thanksgiving, my Mother died by suicide. The pain in my heart, body and soul consumed every one of my waking and sleeping moments. I dropped out of school and stood on the threshold of following her ... trying to find her, I thought maybe I could.

This was 16 years before Forrest Gump took off across America ... running from his grief at losing his beloved Jenny. I swear I did the same. 

I started moving - one foot in front of the other - not fast - not slow ... but not stopping. I ran almost every day until, into my 50s, my knees gave out. I had to stop. 

I think the decades of running kept my body and health from being destroyed by the emotional and spiritual pain. I’m no doctor- but that’s my theory.

With all the miles of running through streets, fields and forests, the pain and grief was never far behind... when I stopped it caught me. But Grief, she too was winded, and we bent at the waist, panting for breath, looking for a long time each other in the eyes... we made peace.

There is still a hole in my heart but at least my heart is whole."
2021-04-26 17:45,"Grief is also cumulative and not always caused by only by death. My best friend of 20 years got a brain virus in 2004 that fried her short term memory making her an invalid at 40 years old. She now lives in a state across the country. I've seen her once in 16 years. That same year my boy friend was murdered. My son had left for college in 2000. Empty-nest syndrome is real and I had to take anti-depressants for three years. A few years later my parents died within a year of one another. Soon after a couple of my old dogs and my beautiful horse died. Carrying for them had been therapy to me. And, more loss followed, but loss and grief are an integral part if life aren't they. Those of us left behind must carry on because life can still be beautiful and the natural world will sustain us. Walking and taking deep breaths will allow the grieving mind to rest. I am grateful for that."
2021-04-26 17:59,"I am glad that the author drew the necessary connection between love and grief...that you cannot have one without the other. For all that is written about love, we as a society need to dedicate more time and thought to grief. I agree with the opinion that Western Civilization ignores death, dying, and grief in our day to day lives because it is scary and uncomfortable. This fundamental gap in our rules on how to live makes the death, dying, and grieving process all the harder when we are the ones in the experience. Beginning in 2017 and ending 14 months later I lost my father, one close friend, mother, and then best friend. The physical and emotional changes I went through were profound. The ways that my friends and colleagues dealt with my grief ranged from complete abandonment to really trying, but not having any clue on how to listen, react, support. We can do better."
2021-04-26 18:08,"I have experienced so much loss in the last several years that I can see it in my face, including my bother who died of Covid and I was never able to speak to him or visit him while he was in the ICU for a month; it’s aged me and I often feel like I have the flu, which my counselor has attributed to grief. 

Yet, I read a quote (sorry, I don’t remember who said this or where I read it—another consequence of grief which has ruined my memory) that said, in essence, I would rather feel this pain than to have him feel the pain of losing me. 

That’s what love is."
2021-04-26 18:26,"After losing several family members within three years ; the grief and sadness profoundly changed me . When I emerged , it was as a different person connected still to the world around me but as a more pensive and deeply caring aware human being . The pain of loss will always be there , but what helped heal were the dreams of them visiting me . I would wake feeling at peace and happy to have seen them . I am a more whole person as a result ."
2021-04-26 18:29,"My son,Andy, died 3 years ago. He was 31. He was a functional alcoholic with  and probably because  of untreated  depressive  type 2 bipolar  and ADD. In a very intelligent  person these can be masked for years. He wouldn't  continue to go to the doctor.  Can you tell  I still feel like I  failed him? I  mostly  realize it was his own responsibility but it still creeps in. My grief persists and my heart clenches  at times when I  see his picture or think of certain things. That's the physical  part for me.. I  miss him and feel  the loss of our future. I sometimes  dream about him. Usually the dreams are positive like he is trying  to  tell  me he is OK. I don't  think the grief will go away. How could it? But it isn't  constant. I  still  have joy. I  am blessed with two  other adult children  and two delightful  grandchildren.  The biggest  help was going to retreat for  grieving  parents, The Emmaus Retreat for Grieving  Parents. Half the parent's  at that session  had lost sons to drugs or alcohol.  It was a consolation  to be with other parents  who were in the same boat. Within three  months of Andy's  death  my cat of 20 years and my 95 year old mother  died. All with different  levels  of grief. Getting  two kittens  that same summer  helped, too. A new life to enjoy. Thanks for letting  me run on and on about this. I  am sure other grievers understand.  Wishing  you peace."

2021-04-26 14:24,"I lost the love of my life from cancers. Within the same year and a half, I lost a close friend to the recurrence of a rare cancer, and  another close friend died (and got better in two minutes) from another cancer. 

You learn you have to grieve alone. Society avoids talking about cancer deaths, and being isolated by your social circle compounds the grief."
2021-04-26 14:06,"Grief is tied to an irrevocable loss of hope, be it related to self or others."
2021-04-26 19:31,"My mom died of cancer my early years of high school. The void left was indescribable. Nobody talked about her thereafter. She disappeared into the wind and I was never able to even say goodbye as her illness was hidden from me. 

I was left to manage my high school years without guidance, left to get married and have babies without the tender touch or loving guidance of a mother. 
Having my own children, grief unexpectedly came pouring out of me like a fire hydrant. I felt so alone, missed my mother immeasurably and wondered why having babies made me feel angry and isolated and envious of other mothers whose own mothers were right there by their sides.  I was robbed of loving my own babies fully when they were little- as I was drowning in grief that nobody understood or recognized, not even myself. 

I now focus on loving my babies fiercely, loving myself even more and working on unwinding and understanding the trauma I experienced. I absolutely love the life I have created for myself. My husband is a gift and my children my treasure. I know the fragility of life but also it’s beauty. I take advance of life’s awesomeness every moment I get. 
I am a non-conformist and live by my own rules, not by the rules dictated to me by society. My mother’s death taught me that and for that I will be eternally grateful to her."
2021-04-26 19:41,"Reading the readers' experience on grief, I could not avoid feeling for all of them but it also reminded me how sensitive we are as humans despite all the distance, apparent indifference and aggressiveness we display. At times, walking outdoors I see expressionless faces but I know that behind that mask there is a heart and a soul.
I was waken by a phone call from across the ocean at the age of 39 to be told that my only family member, my mother,  had just died. I suddenly felt empty, floating in the air, without any connection to anybody and anything and soon I started feeling insensitive to others' pain. Since that distant, and proximate, 1990 I lost several relatives and friends but, except for two friends who died in another continent, I never felt grief or sorrow after their death."
2021-04-26 19:58,"There is a dearth of study on parental grief.  We found one, with difficulty, through an NIH search.  It was a study of parents who lost children ranging from just born to 35 years old and followed parents over 15 years.
It was prompted by the prevailing belief that mothers, a particular focus, who experienced grief beyond 5 years of the death were mentally ill.
Parental grief stands apart because it defies humans' sense of what's natural:  children survive their parents.
It doesn't matter how often nature ignores our logic.  Parents are not geared to accept its apparent cruelty."
2021-04-26 20:23,"Thank you for this article - As mindful as I’ve tried to be, it hadn’t occurred to me that grief over my father’s death could have contributed to all the increases in risks for diabetes and heart disease, as well as cancer; always thin, to the point of worry, I gained more weight than I thought possible.

I had instead attributed it to age, poor diet and lack of exercise (all of which were surely true as well), but never considered the impact of grief on my physical health.  Past emotional stress, such as breakups, left me with a loss of appetite and thus loss of weight, a very different set of results."
2021-04-26 20:38,"When I lost my mother in March, a friend gave me a saying that has comforted me:
Grief is the price of love."
2021-04-26 20:50,"I have never had children so I can't say I know how that feels, but it seems to me that my experience with my little dog of 13 years had to have approximated that. The health issues she had also made me compare it to having kids.

She was, without a doubt, one of the loves of my life. She was so smart, I never had to teach her anything.  She just knew.  It was astounding to see how she knew my moods, both good and bad, and there came a time when I realized this little creature humanized me.

With that background, I can say that when she died and after I buried her, I was in a state I can only compare to my Father's death and yet it seemed even worse.

I took a day away from work and for the next week performed my duties in a robotic fashion. On the following Sunday, I lay down in a darkened room, alone in my house, with my mind seemingly blank. I had no pain at all. ...but I began to feel a pressure on my chest. 

I was not at all afraid and I realized my body was shutting down and I was fine with that. Within just a few minutes of that, I seemed to be wrenched back as  I thought, ""What will happen to my Mother? I have to take care of her."" Then, everything changed and the pressure lifted.

...but, at that moment, I knew it was possible to die of grief."

2021-04-26 22:17,"I just got off the phone with my brother, who’s been struggling to finish the last year of a master’s program, due to long-term depression.  We lost our sister unexpectedly to a rare disease in 1983, when she was just 22 years old. My brother was a senior in high school at the time and barely made it through the year. Our parents were wrapped up in their own grief and basically forgot about us. We both spent our young adulthoods dealing on our own with intense, sometimes paralyzing grief. Both of us were later diagnosed with depressive syndromes. I eventually developed cancer, and my brother developed heart problems—at ages when both of us were really too young to have such drastic health issues. This year, the pandemic isolation hit my mother particularly hard; without any social or intellectual stimuli, her dementia worsened to the point where she is essentially gone. And now our father, who has been her main caregiver, has recently been diagnosed with cancer. The blows this year have been staggering, and each fresh loss also reminds us of the old wounds. As many have noted, you don’t ever “move on” from grief—just last night I had a dream that I was searching for my sister and could not find her. You do learn how to cope, how to be honest about your feelings, how to recognize the truly important things in life. Still, the effects of loss and grief early on can color everything you do for the rest of your life; we are living examples of that."
2021-04-26 22:25,"Thank you for your thoughtful a scientific evaluation of the  emotional and chemical reality of grief that flood our bodies when trauma of any kind happens.
I am a retired therapist and when my husband of 55 years died in 2017 I would say I was in shock or numb for at least the first month.  Then for the next 3-4 months I would have a deep sobbing episode every day.  No thoughts connected with these episodes just deep physical expression.  I realized it was my amygdala, the emotional part of my brain getting use to the loss and that words don't emanate fro this part of the brain.

I let these episodes happen and they subsided after a time.  I did notice that the blown up pictures my children had made for the funeral didn't help and put them away for a while.  Now I can look at our many trips and family photos with fondness.

The line that gradually our connection with the person moves from grief too residing in our memory was true for me.  I do believe that the emotional part of our brain grieves in it's own way, and in a society where negative emotions are denigrated or physical expression sadness and pain rob some of the process of grief,   Which is both physically emotional as well thoughtful integrated cognition.It  has always made me sad when a saw WWII vet cry about their experience years after the war 40 -50 years after the war"
2021-04-26 22:40,"My husband passed away suddenly five years ago and the young age of 48. In those five years I've seen various responses to the grief I feel, some extremely compassionate, some incredibly callous. I think what has been the most difficult is feeling so different and apart from all of my friends and family members who haven't experienced such a traumatic loss.  Please -- if you know anybody who is suffering a loss, try to make them feel understood. It's the greatest gift you can give."

He died in my arms one night a year ago. I learned then that I was not afraid of death nor dying. I still say goodnight and happy dreams every night before I fall asleep. He’s gone, but I’m not. And, having loved him does not mean that I’m not prepared to love again. I’m not looking for a duplicate. But I am looking. You simply garner your inner resources and,  if that’s your plan, you search for a new mate. Tomorrow is the best day to continue with your life.  Plus, he’s getting his raucous Garden Party this October!!"
2021-04-27 0:54,"In my opinion, 6 months is not long enough a time to claim that a certain amount of grief is abnormal and requires a diagnosis of ""complicated grief."" That should be reserved for a few years down the line, surely? Yes, I'm doing better 6 months on but it's still a struggle and I wouldn't want to push people to resolve grief in so quick a timespan. I hope that makes sense."
2021-04-27 1:10,"Grief Is.... you learn to live with it. That’s it. The love of my life died 4.5 years ago of early onset Alzheimer’s. He suffered for over 10 years. I was his caregiver until he finally went to a memory care unit where he died. I truly went into a coma. Unable to tell the difference between a red and green light. Could not remember where friends lived. I felt like I was existing in a bubble for several years. My health was a mess. The physical pain was unbelievable. I went from being in top physical condition to being bedridden from pain. Finally 2 things happened, a very very rare medical condition almost killed me, May Thurner Syndrome, but I quite remarkably recovered after months of rehab. And I was diagnosed with seronegative RA. Now after 4.5 years I finally feel like I am out of the coma. But I do wonder how my deep unrelenting grief affected my health."

My husband suffered a sudden appearance of late-onset mental illness with psychosis....his psychotic break and fall into illness literally changed his personality, his character, everything that made him, HIM. 

A doctor the night I managed to drag him to the ER told be that I should consider the husband I knew was now dead. He would never return.   

He might eventually seek help and learn to better manage his illness, but it would alter him forever. My loving, funny, smart and adored husband became a cruel, dark, changed person I in no way recognized.  

I went into shock. I am still in mourning of someone who walks the earth. As are his friends and family.  How do you mourn, and make others understand, that a living death just might be worse to come to grips with?

When you see someone who has lost their husband, and the support they are given, and you feel envious of that grace, care, and simple hard truth....you know you are in a  very dark place."
2021-04-27 2:59,My parents died and I knew the grieving would be difficult so I started physical training for triathlons...riding my bike long djstances...a combination of the physical activity and the mental mediation on a bike or run plus an excellent peer group helped to save me from deleterious physical symptoms. Id be curious about the impact of exercise on grieving.
2021-04-27 4:04,"Two months after a breakup and I'm still grieving what I thought would be a future with a perfect partner, and a relative of this person said, 'It's [tears, upset stomach, headache, etc.] not worth it.""  That is the comment of someone who has never experienced true love, and is proud of having been non-committal for 65 years. I find that so sad."
2021-04-27 4:17,"I really wish that everyone would drop this 6-12 month timeline, as it sets up all sorts of expectations of what is considered ""normal"" grief. Especially in this pandemic when we are told to isolate to survive, nothing is normal, and the 6-12 month ""normal"" timeline looks even more abnormal."
2021-04-27 4:34,"Once we know more about how grief impacts our health, what do we do with it? I know it’s worth the research, still I feel caught in the system of believing that it may be too complicated to address the spectrum of physical reactions to loss and potential risk factors. Then the scientist in me laughs because we all know that’s what research is for, and is really the main point of the article. Until someone finds answers, we should get ahead of it by teaching (and learning) healthy ways on how to face loss and change. Not only because of bereavement over death, but perhaps to a way of life that has been subdued, even castrated, during the pandemic."
2021-04-27 4:39,"I will probably never recover from the loss of my 38 y/o son. He was born with multiple birth defects and each day was a struggle for him. He never had one easy day. We were told he wouldn't survive more than a day; then, not more than a month; then, a year. After a while we just started ignoring them. We WILLED him to live - and, he did. He was a musician, a singer, a cartoonist. But, it finally caught up to him and he just couldn't do it anymore. I guess that because we had lived for so long with his imminent loss it was so much harder to accept. It has been 15 years and most days I'm fine but then out of nowhere it hits me again - just like day one. The late actor Kristoff St. John who lost his son to suicide said: ""Grieving the loss of a child is a process. It begins on the day your child passes, and ends the day the parent joins them."" I agree.  I lost both parents and felt the loss acutely - but not like the loss of my son. He was my child. I expected to bury  my parents but not my child.  In describing grief Flaubert has Julian Barnes say: “(on grief) And you do come out of it, that’s true. After a year, after five. But you don’t come out of it like a train coming out of a tunnel, bursting through the downs into sunshine and that swift, rattling descent to the Channel; you come out of it as a gull comes out of an oil-slick. You are tarred and feathered for life.”  I do feel that I am tarred and feathered for life. I shall never recover from this grievous wound."
2021-04-27 6:57,"I watched my twin sons, Felix and Oliver, die after birth. That was nearly three years ago. Since the day they died it’s been a struggle to live. I forgot to eat and food didn’t seem desirable, I didn’t sleep because the trauma of losing them weighed heavily on me, I didn’t care about anything. 
I floated on in a world of shock, deep deep grief, suicidal ideations, and ‘what if’s’. I’m just now turning the corner where I have learned to carry the grief of losing them and can exist in a world without them. But you never “get over it” and there is no timeline for this; you only learn to carry it and make space for it. 
The grief of losing my sons wrecked me and decimated the person I was before. I am a different person than I used to be. I think differently and act very differently, and there’s nothing I can do to change it. And I wouldn’t change it even if I could. The me that was forged in the darkness of grief is a testament to the sons I love, lost and still miss. It is the new me that carried me through their cremation, packing up their nursery, and every milestone that they’re not here for; it’s the me that is surviving.
Grief is the hardest thing I have ever had to endure and carry, but it can be done and the deep, vast, incredible, painful, early, and raw grief does not last forever. I wish I could hug and be there for every griever to simply make them feel heard and understood; carrying grief is no easy task."
2021-04-27 7:58,"Thank you for this fascinating article. A few months after my mom died in 2008, the toes on my left foot began to grow numb & tingle; eventually the numbness, pain & tingling worked its way up  my left leg. Fast forward a few months:  all 4 limbs became numb, tingling, in burning pain...only my torso was not affected. Countless MRI's, tests, specialist exams only led to the diagnosis of ""ideopathic peripheral neuropathy""...something I have to this day. It is fairly well controlled by medication but still a daily, chronic challenging part of my life. I attribute it all to grief. The body is a mysterious thing indeed."
2021-04-27 9:40,"When my mother died from cirrohsis after nine months in a hospital, she was 40 and I was 20, a student in college now living with my 13-year-old menacing brother.  To say my grief was complicated is quite an understatement.  I was obsessed with absolute hatred of her and depaired over the fact that nothing had been resolved in our relationship.  My previous years as a functioning young person devolved into a suicidal alcoholic and I was hospitalized at 25.

This is what eventually transpired:  I was able to finally tap into my overwhelming love for her and forgive her, and I became a highly functioning adult.  Once I was able to find cherished and positive memories, I was set free.  Naturally, my experiences are far from most people and I cannot begin to comprehend the sorrow that people have from loss of spouses and children.  I am simply offering hope to those whose relationships were very complicated and unfair and to use a cliche, love conquers all."
2021-04-27 15:39,"Having lost an infant son and a beautiful 22 year old son and my wife now with stage 4 lung cancer, I can assure the readers that the physical aspects of grief are very important and must be attended to just as much as you would take care of any aspect of your health.  Sleep is absolutely critical, eating well and exercising hard are also important, and staying connected to those who get it.  Even with all that, every day and sometimes many moments in many days are a huge burden to just keep moving and doing the hard work of grieving.  I found it helpful to think of it as hard work that will go on for a long time, but the efforts truly pay off.  Eventually I found I must embrace the pain in the sense that I try not to avoid it but make peace with it.  I can and do live in both worlds - the indescribable pain world, and the joyful and amazing beauty of life world.  Above all I know that if my son was alive today he would be absolutely on my case to keep moving, to truly make the most of my life, to live boldly every minute.  Once my wife is gone, I need to do the same for our daughter.  If I am fortunate enough to see them all again I want more than anything for them to be proud of how I lived my life without them."
2021-04-27 16:23,"My mother had been suffering from various illnesses for years, then she finally degenerated into dementia. I visited her a few times as she failed, before hospice and then death. The couple of weeks before her death were torturous. I sat by her bedside in a rehab facility (she had fallen and broken bones). She was in agony. She didn’t know who I was. I didn’t know who she was. She was my mother but also not my mother. My heart was breaking then it finally broke as she drifted off into death. This all occurred in 11/19. Then the pandemic happened. For months I had recurring nightmares of my mother’s last days. I couldn’t sleep. Lost weight. My arthritis worsened. Now I’m not having  nightmares but I miss her. There is an empty place in me somewhere. The uniqueness of her, the protectiveness—gone. Life is different without your mother, you feel differently about yourself. You kind of grow up a little. Even with loved ones around you you morph into someone else a little.  But i think I’ve grown from this experience. I hope she would be proud of me."
2021-04-27 12:01,"This whole article is too clinically antiseptic in its approach to serious grief. Alan Ball, the creator of SIX FEET UNDER, the best show ever made about grief. said it best: ""Grief makes you crazy."" It certainly does and that craziness feels a lot like schizophrenia in the early days especially. 

Feeling sorrowful over the loss of a loved one is not the same as grief. Grief is the searing and relentless pain you feel when someone you love and, more importantly NEED, is ripped from your life, and when that event is sudden and completely unexpected he pain is intensified. The resulting void feels like a black hole that can never be filled again. For some people, grief will fade; for others, it takes a lifetime."
2021-04-27 2:25,"Silly me. I thought this was going to be about grief, in which we are currently inundated, not just grief caused by rona-related deaths. Next …"
2021-04-30 13:21,"My eldest son was randomly murdered 4 weeks ago at age 31.  Second generation in a row where  the  father survives his eldest son. 

Gabe was a musician and left the world a lot of music, but one song always stood apart -- the first he ever wrote and recorded, when he was just 11, about the sudden loss of a loved one, called Like An Angel.

You can listen to it here:
<a href=""https://tinyurl.com/GabeDonnayLikeAnAngel"" target=""_blank"">https://tinyurl.com/GabeDonnayLikeAnAngel</a>

He wrote this to mourn the loss of a character he loved in a book he was reading.  But in retrospect, he wrote it for everyone who mourns the sudden  loss of a loved one.  His last album, Love Hz by Satchmode, was about the same theme, loaded with songs lamenting sudden loss. 

 But the last song on that album, the last song he wrote, is called Happiness, and it is a huge comfort to me to know he got there before he was murdered."
2021-05-03 10:57,We lost suddenly lost our 36 year old son to a catastrophic brain hemorrhage seven years ago.  The immediate pain and that it what it was was horrible for me.  My husband processed it differently.  He took over the funeral arrangements and was a rock for me and our son's wife.  But later he was the one to suffer.  One thing not covered in this article is how people in the same family can grieve differently and at different times.  Managing that and supporting each other can be difficult.
2021-05-03 11:03,The Year of Magical Thinking by Joan Didion is a remarkable book on the process of grief.
2021-05-03 11:05,"My beloved mother just recently died, it will be 6 weeks this Thursday. The last 2 days she was in the hospital when it became clear that she would not recover and never fully wake up gain, that felt like someone was cutting out my heart. Her actual death just finished the process. 
Intellectually you know you will eventually lose the people who are close to you, but nothing can prepare you for when it actually happens. She was the sun in our families little solar system and now she's not there any more.  
I am 60. I had my mother for a long time and we did many things together over the years. I will always have those memories despite the pain of knowing that they're it; no more new adventures, I'll never hear her voice again or be able to hug her. Maybe a day will come when it no longer feels so raw, but I don't think it will be anytime soon. 
My heart goes out to those who lost a child or other loved one who did not have a life to form those memories. And to those who were not able to have that closeness despite a lifetime of chances."
2021-05-03 11:36,"My mother died when I was 12. My experience seems to have hard-wired a 12 yr old's grief process, which has been difficult as I have aged. But ultimately what I have felt is very similar to this quote:  “gradually moves from preoccupying the mind to residing comfortably in the heart.” 
It felt as if the grief and love was eventually absorbed into my body, rather than being a separate thing. There is something comforting in this feeling, as if you carry the person with you, inside you."
2021-05-03 12:09,"My eldest son was violently killed by someone he had befriended in 2013. My son was 26. As what should have been his 34th birthday approaches, grief rears up again. It's always there of course, just more of an undercurrent. I have accepted it as an essential part of my life.
If Anything Happens, I Love You streaming on Netflix is a stunning illustration of how heartbreaking loss can tear us apart or bring us together."
2021-05-03 13:13,"My wonderful husband died unexpectedly in February, 2020.  We had just moved into our  newly built ""aging in place"" home, and had plans to begin traveling postponed by extremely busy professional lives.  In early March of 2020, the state was locked down for Covid, and for the next year, I experienced deep grief in isolation...they are not compatible.  Friends called, texted, emailed, and I learned how to do Zoom/Go To Meetings.  I was so busy taking care of issues, and yearned for the company of my close friends.. and they yearned to be with me and help me.  We were afraid to travel and be together.  Since schools and most offices were closed, my daughter and her family came to visit for long periods setting up 4 workstations around the house.  In October, I begin to have shortness of breath with a hard time catching my breath...not from exercise....I had every test to try and make a diagnosis with focus on heart issues....everything was fine...doctors finally agreed it was stress related....I am  an extremely strong woman, and thought I was handling my grief  and shock. while in isolation, fairly well.....the grief was still still there, hidden by my frantic attention to taking care of business at hand.  Only now, am I beginning to fully realize and understand the life of a widow.  Life is very different."
2021-05-03 13:21,"An interesting article, especially related to the brain imaging in complicated grief. The fact that the reward part of the brain lights up in response to the loss of the loved one in the same way the responds to say, chocolate, explains a lot. I have a friend who still obsesses over the loss of her husband 15 years ago is a case in point. She is barely functional. Thank you for a great article."
2021-05-03 13:33,"We are all here together telling our painful stories. My very strong and wonderful wife died abruptly of cancer in October 2020.  We were climbing mountains in August. 
It is now May and I experience great stress and sorrow every day.  I wish all of us survivors the strength to cope and carry on.   I am sure this is taking years off of my life. So be it. I will try to do well by my children and my friends. My heart goes out to all those who have experienced loss. Whether by COVID or any other calamity."
2021-05-03 13:47,"Having lost 2 sons to addiction in the last 6 years, I do know that loss physically brings us to our knees, in painful yearning not only for for the presence of our loved ones, but also for the tragic loss of their chance to live out and experience their lives fully, in peace and with joy. Hearts do break, whereas mine would race uncontrollably in the middle of many sleepless nights, only to be quieted by the mindfulness breathing techniques taught by our grief counselor. It helped. The passage of time helps.

What also helped is volunteering in areas of interest, one working with hospitalized patients, the other working  in a nature preserve, honoring the particular interests of the youngest son we lost. Also establishing a fund in our family's name, devoted to promoting the educattion and prevention of Substance Use Disorder in the town where our sons were raised. The losses of the pandemic heightened my empathy for suffering families. Those who have walked in the depths of grief ""get it""...we are one, we understand, and we are not alone.

Finally, the most insightful discussion of grief I've ever heard was between Anderson Cooper and Steven Colbert on CNN. Here these 2 remarkable men discussed the searing loss of their fathers and brothers at a young age...its impact on their families and their lives..and their recognition that they found themselves, through the years, adapting to living ""lives we never thought we would be living"".  Truly inspiring. Moving. Universal."
2021-05-03 15:13,"My first love was killed in a car accident when I was a young man in my early twenties.  My life upended, everything changed.  A friend told me that I was stuck in a grief loop, but there was no suggestion as to how to get out of it.  I carried it with me.

Now, almost fifty years later, reading this article and the accompanying comments, I felt a familiar heavy pressure on my chest and there were tears in my eyes.  

Some years ago there was an article in the NYT that dealt with loss.  A reader wrote a letter to the Times and she wrote something that was profound, at least to me.  She said that 'you have every right to grieve, but you don't have a right to feel sorry for yourself.'  That helped.  I copied that letter and refer to it.  Still, defining where grief ends and feeling sorry for yourself begins isn't an easy task.

To all here who have shared, I am truly sorry for your losses."
2021-05-03 15:18,"I lost my 49 year old wife 10 years ago, leaving me a single dad to my two beautiful kids.  Grief is like water, it comes and goes as it pleases, but the intensity diminishes over time and you learn to live with the major loss.  What a lot of people don’t address, however, are the secondary losses and the grief compounded by those.  After the death of a spouse, it’s common to lose some friends, who drift away unexplained.  Those losses can also include careers, financial security, spiritual beliefs, family members, future plans and any sense that life is fair.  That grief is like ripples in a pond that can cascade through your life for years, maybe forever."
2021-05-03 16:10,"I believe “complicated grief” will be formally acknowledged as a component of PTSD for many people.

Consider the experience of women who publicly report rape or harassment in the workplace as a small example. We are almost universally disbelieved, denied, minimized, gaslighted and ostracized, instead of surrounded by nurturing comfort and care. So how can you grieve what you have just experienced, when you are denied? And especially when folx are forced to continue living with  or working alongside abusers because they are economically trapped.

And many of those that would like to be supportive don’t know how, because our culture doesn’t teach anyone how to do that.

That is just one example."
2021-05-03 18:48,"I wonder if the Buddhists have a perspective that might be helpful in searching for how to meet grief. There is a Buddhist ceremony shown in a film produced about the Himalayas in which a beautiful mandala is formed with great precision and care. After its formation, the mandala is carefully swept away (to which I felt an immediate resistance). A focus on impermanence seems to be a critical element of the  ceremony. But creation is also. The recent death of a friend of many decades reminded me of the film--and that my friend was ever an artist, creating and moving beyond the creation."
2021-05-03 18:54,"In less than two weeks will pass the first anniversary of the death of my wife of my wife of 39 years. I don't grieve openly or easily: I experienced a ton of death in Vietnam as a Navy Hospital Corpsman in the triage of a field hospital near Danang in support mostly of Marines. It isn't the same thing as trying to keep strangers from dying, but watching my wife die from cancer was not my first rodeo. She died at home, rather quickly after I returned her from the hospital. The pain is not in any sense reduced. I recall all the hideous details of that struggle which went on for a few years before the final days. I functioned quite well, physically, and I engage in some social activities, especially cooking for friends, but I miss her constantly. (She and I were fond of cooking together for company.) I learned in Vietnam to carry on daily in the midst of death, but in a way that is not helpful as I am doubtful I will ever adjust to her death. I carry on, but I also make stupid mistakes in personal matters and sometimes have problems concentrating (something I am practiced with as I did my PhD studies in mathematics). Though I had plenty of experience with death, I find in another sense that this was my first rodeo. As I sit alone at my computer writing this, I am crying. It is not something I have done much in my life and did not do often after her death, even at her death which I handled without emotion. It is a learned stoic lie."
2021-05-03 19:57,"Thank you for sharing to authors of all the comments. Will not attempt to add anything, just to share.  As I passed age of 70, I began losing good decades-old friendships.  The wall I come up against is the uniqueness of those friendships.  Things small and large understood only by that friend only in his/her unique way are gone in this earthly forever. Learning to live with these losses, but never quite getting over them, I endeavor to value what I had."
2021-05-03 20:33,I’m moved by these stories. We all have our share of grief in life.
2021-05-03 21:11,"I am approaching the second anniversary of my wife's death, after 35 years of marriage. She died after a seven-year battle with cancer but was relatively healthy up until the last 8 months of her life. We spent the years following her diagnosis doing as many things as possible on her bucket list and truly appreciating every day in ways we sometimes overlooked before the diagnosis. While her cancer was terrible in so many ways, we both realized that her diagnosis was also a gift to us, reminding us that we needed to live in the moment and fully appreciate the life that we had. Following her death I allowed others to take care of me, something that does not come naturally to me, but I was also very attentive to my grown daughters' grieving, Last year when we marked the one-year anniversary of my wife's death, I knew I was moving forward, no longer simply treading water, but still grieving while allowing myself to entertain the possibility of someone coming into my life as a companion. After many one-and-done first dates, today I have found my partner for the remaining third of my life and of course she is someone who embraces my past as I do her's. Am I still grieving? Yes, but there is plenty of room in my heart for my new love and for a soon-to-arrive first grandchild who will be told about her grandma who is no longer here. I embrace my grieving in all its many stages and in the wisdom it has imparted on me."

2021-05-03 17:47,"A very relevant article for this day and age… of climate change, the rise and fall of an authoritarian like Trump in the U.S., and the fact that we’re in living with Covid and, according to today’s NYT, will be living with it for years. I grieve for the world I grew up on… one that I will never experience again."
2021-05-03 12:36,"When I was 9 years old, my father walked into the kitchen and killed my mother and himself in the presence of my two older siblings and myself.  I never recovered completely.  But I could never imagine a grief more devastating than losing a child or grandchild.  That is not the ordinary course of events.  Parents are not supposed to bury their children."
2021-05-03 21:17,"This is indeed what it means to be human. My heart goes out to so many; it feels trite to say that love is forever even as I know it is, and easier to accept when you’ve not lost a young person or a beloved whom you’ve expected to have a much longer time on this earth with￼￼. I have friends who have experienced this and became grief counselors themselves and while that’s not my expertise, I can definitely be a friend to someone who is experiencing loss, which is also what being human is about.￼"
2021-05-03 15:25,"I found this article very disturbing, I’am not making light of the loss of a spouse, and mother at a young age, but somehow with trying can be helped with support.
However the loss of a child is the worst death that can occur, and the did not address this very hard to comprehend.
Sorry that u might think I’am a very bitter person, not so."

Thank you for keeping this Comment section open for more than a week now.
Many readers have had a chance to express grief, and share their sorrows.
Others have expressed empathy and good will.

2021-05-04 2:45,"My father died in February from cancer and my mother died 25 years ago, also from cancer. I am middle aged now and after years of therapy am coping better than I did at the age of 26 when I didn’t know how to grieve.

Still, I don’t think we humans aren’t built to lose loved ones. It’s simply too profound to comprehend that someone in your life has simply vanished from the earth. Over time reality sets in, but even years later you can find worse of awash in disbelief."
2021-05-04 3:22,"When a good friend died in 2019, I was clumsy for a few days. I bumped into furniture in my house, cut myself accidentally chopping fruit. My husband told me not to drive. Like a drunk person, I had felt capable of functioning, but once he said that, I realized I was in a fog, even in the moments when I wasn’t actively thinking about my friend."
2021-05-04 3:46,"It is going to be two years since I lost my mom with whom I was very close. Never a day has passed without me feeling a sense of extreme grief, and hopelessness. I have lost the zest for life in some way. What was important for me before is not anymore. In spite of having a great family, I am lonely inside."
2021-05-04 3:53,"Last May after caring for my wife for 22 yeasr with Parkinson's disease she developed  related  dementia and other effects of late or end stage PD,She went from Hospital to Hospice care where she still remain unable to talk nor walk.
This is my own self now dying  with her ,we had no children ,she and myself were each others children and best friend.
The pandemic for 9 months allowed me only to visit her on Facetime and that took a many phone calls to arrange at a NYC nursing home overwhelmed with families calling and residents and even staff dying.
I am so sad and know when she goes so will my body breaking down this last year (even needing coronary stents)  go with her. 
I just can't see any other way to alleviate my loniness .
I have suffered 1 year of anticipatory grief ,crying to friends ,family and social workers who at times comforted me but alone is alone."
2021-05-04 4:04,"Two thoughts:

1. My father died when my mother was 6 months pregnant with me. Because she was at his side as he died, so was I. I’ve been told that he was exceptionally intelligent, with a photographic memory, an Irish temper and sense of humor, and an ahead-of-his-time devotion to his children, my 5 siblings. 

I can tell you that there is a very real and distinct difference between normal grief and complicated grief. My mother died when I was 20, and although I experienced extended grief for her because of my young age, this grief did eventually find its way from my brain to my heart, as so eloquently described in this article. However, the grief I feel about my father is not the same. It is unresolved, deeply painful, capable of laying me low without warning, at times excruciating. Because of all the physical maladies mentioned in this article, it surprises me that I’ve lived to be 66 based on the damage that I know this grief for him has done to me. 

2. Everyone agrees that losing a child is the worst thing that can happen to a person, and I won’t tempt fate by arguing against that widespread belief. However, it surely is a close second to lose a parent at too tender an age. One thing that makes it so egregious is knowing that you are not the person you would or could have been if they’d been there."
2021-05-04 4:12,"I lost my mother to covid in January, but I kind of lost her earlier than that to Alzheimer’s.  She was such a fierce bright light, always laughing, always interested in everyone around her.  Then what started as a joke, her telling me that she’d be okay as long as she could remember her children, became a test.  Did my mother remember me?  Could she forgive me, forgive any of us, for not being able to rescue her from the home where she was obligated to live?  The saddest part of her dying was the loneliness she must have felt during that last year of her life.  Everything closed and remained closed because too many people had twisted ideas about freedom and no idea at all about community.  My poor mum didn’t understand any of that.  At least her caregivers were kind and hugged her for us.  We had to visit with her and then, later, watch her die through our computer screens.  Despite all of the precautions the management took, somebody brought covid into the care home and my mother was dead a couple of weeks later.  

This grief seems to have brought out every other grief I’ve ever felt so that I feel exhausted from carrying them all.  During that first month of bereavement, I woke up early and wrote for hours.  Big stories, little stories.   Sometimes I shared them, but most of them I keep to myself as a way of keeping my mother present.  It helps more than anything else I can imagine except maybe being able to hug my mother one last time."
2021-05-04 4:38,"I lost my young child in a terrible accident. Her death was so shocking and horrible and my love for her so deep that I felt in the months after she died, that I was slowly dying. I felt literally crushed, on fire and breathless at the same time, day after day. A year later, I was diagnosed with MS, completely unsurprised. It made perfect sense that my body would go haywire. It would have been impossible for me to be physically ok. Losing a child is devastating to mind and body. Holding onto my love for her and her sisters, keeps me alive."
2021-05-04 5:52,My brother completed suicide in 2008. I spent more than a decade grappling with grief in so many ways. It’s only in the last few months I’ve come to have a curiosity about him. We both have/had a mental health disability that makes us prone to suicide compared to gen pop. What support might we have been for each other if we had the skills and resources? Why did he have a gun? Why do families refuse to accept the problems in front of them?
2021-05-04 6:27,"I have read some 25 or so comments on the article. These are laden with expression of emotion. To quote 1 ""  I can definitely be a friend to someone who is experiencing loss, which is also what being human is about.""

Is it inhuman to express otherwise? Is being human no more than a bundle of emotion? Is that what the species was meant to be? Not to shed tears, heartless? Why must one bear some emotional or physical disorder to prove one's love? Is being human about grieving? Being fragile?

What then of all those who bear their human quality with noble endeavors? Who remain ""cool"" amidst chaos and bloodshed? 

To give heart, I will cite an own experience. In a visit to a famous ruin in Cambodia I encountered a female child about 12. She stood by a gateway peddling silk scarfs. She looked ragged.   And perched on her back was am infant. Both parents were dead. Care for the infant was in her hands. 

She, too, displayed emotion. She was joyous with purchase of several scarfs.  Clasped the infant with a tender hug. Asked if I would come by the next day. Appearing there had been her gift a small wood carving. 

Whatever it means to be human, I prefer to believe this is a closser example for human vindication."
2021-05-04 8:09,"Reading all these stories has really brought home the fact that grief isn’t something apart from what we think of as our “normal” selves.  Grief is integral to the human condition.  Many of us spend successive years grieving multiple losses and painful and empty as it may feel, it’s as much a part of the journey of life as adolescence or parenthood.

We need to be kinder to each other."
2021-05-04 5:35,"I lost my young adult child to rapid onset gender dysphoria. Within two years, out of nowhere, my child changed their name, gender, had healthy breasts removed in the guise of being a “non-binary boy” and started the addictive drug, cross sex hormone, testosterone. It’s like they read a script... “I know I blindsighted you, you’re transphobic, I don’t want anything to do with you or my siblings or any other family member.” And I am just one of thousands of parents who have lost their living child to a cult without a leader. All of this change won’t bring them long term happiness or peace, because there’s something underneath not being addressed. And us parents that adoringly raised our children are left in the wake, barely treading water and there’s no happiness or peace for us either."
2021-05-04 13:47,Thanks for this article.  I too have lost a child.  But no mention of the loneliness of grief? The trauma of some grief? The social isolation? I’m glad this article is out there but found it to be woefully inadequate in addressing many  of the social issues related to loss that affect health.  And there is no dearth of research for example on loneliness and it’s ill effects of health.  I’m not sure if that significant oversight was intentional but it influences my skepticism about the veracity of many of these claims by researchers.
2021-05-04 14:38,"This article and the comments  stream has been by far the most helpful thing for me in the last 3 months after losing my mom to sudden colon cancer. It all happened very fast and unexpected. My dad died a year ago from stroke, in between I moved to another country and job. Now my partner of 5 years is leaving me because she “has to take care of herself” and told me to seek medical help because she cannot help me. I only ever asked for a hug and understanding."
2021-05-05 0:31,"If I Could Only Fly
song written by Blaze Foley
covered by Merle Haggard, Willie Nelson, and others

I almost felt you touching me just now
I wish I knew which way to turn and go
I feel so good and then, then I feel so bad
I wonder what I ought to do

If I could only fly, if I could only fly
I'd bid this place goodbye to come and be with you
But I can hardly stand and I got no where to run
Another sinking sun and one more lonely night

The wind keeps blowing, somewhere, everyday
Tell me things get better, somewhere, up the way
Just dismal thinking on a dismal day
And sad songs for us to bare

If I could only fly
If we could only fly
If we could only fly
There'd be no more lonely nights

You know, sometimes, I write happy songs
Then some little thing goes wrong
I wish they all could make you smile

Coming home soon and I wanna stay
Maybe we can, somehow, get away
I wish you could come with me when I go again

If I could only fly, if I could only fly
I'd bid this place goodbye to come and be with you
But I can hardly stand and I got no where to run
Another sinking sun and one more lonely night

2021-05-10 15:02,"To me, after almost 50 years as a holistic psychotherapist, the most interesting thing about grief is how it's pathologized.
The next most interesting aspect of grief is how it can morph into any other feeling in a nanosecond.
It shape-shifts from sadness, to guilt, anger, anxiety and everything in between. 
What concerns me is how grief is all too often labeled as depression and then medicated.

2021-05-27 1:30,"In the last 13 months, I lost my mom to dementia, my dad to complications from a fall, and two brothers to addiction. I keep coming back to this article and these comments as an anchor to remind myself that the aftershocks I feel--the heaviness, the fog, the bumping into things and dysfunction I'm barely aware of, the amorphousness of grief--are all real. The last death was about five weeks ago, and it hit the hardest. It was my youngest brother, just a year older than me, and the person I was closest to in a very complicated family. Sometimes I have to remind myself that it's only been five weeks. I'm a runner, and I do a track workout with a group once a week in addition to running a few times a week.  Because our intervals are times, the difference in my speed is unmistakable. I'm significantly slower, but with more effort. It's as if I haven't run for several months (I never stopped). I wish I knew exactly why. Understanding the physical underpinnings helps, and this article and the comments are like a key to door that was locked. It doesn't explain everything, but it validates some of what I feel.  In the meantime, I keep running and doing the physical things that I know will help me feel better, even if only a little or for only a little while."
2021-07-11 18:31,I lost my adult daughter two months ago to cancer. It forced me to retire. The utter devastation is so intense I still can’t function. The physical pain is unbearable. We were very close. She called me every day and now my phone is silent. I already had my jaw lock up from grinding my teeth in my sleep. I hate waking up in the morning because I have to remember that it really happened. I do have a therapist plus joined a support group. This article was helpful.
2021-04-21 13:29,"So the war analogy in this article is odd, for starters (now we are in the hand to hand combat phase, really??!). Second, if there was a greater incentive messaged to the public, like ease of travel or increased access to events or retail businesses, maybe more people would get this. However, public health officials basically started out the inoculation campaign by saying even if you get the vaccine you still need to be super cautious with variants etc, so I suspect some people did not have much motivation. I received a vaccine and am happy I did, but unfortunately I understand why some people have justified to themselves why they won’t be getting it. Better and consistent public messaging from the beginning would have been helpful. Lesson learned hopefully."
2021-04-21 13:35,"I'm not reluctant, but there are no appointments until June unless you are willing to drive for at least an hour in my area.  A whole lot of reluctance may just be the inconvenience of scheduling and getting to a vaccination site."
2021-04-21 13:38,"Vaccines are not widely available and easy to get for everyone. In Massachusetts, vaccinations were just made available to the 16-54 crowd on April 19th. Now the rest of us have to sign up - which is not an easy process, with limited availability - especially in rural areas. So don't assume that the rest of the 50% of Americans are just vaccine reluctant. 

I would love a shot!"
2021-04-21 13:44,"Here is what needs to happen - once vaccines have been readily available for everyone for at least a few months, there have to be restrictions on travel, offices, schools, entering stores bars and restaurants, etc. if you cannot provide valid proof of vaccine. In my draconian master plan, past a certain point medical insurance would refuse to cover the costs associated with contracting covid of you were able to get the vaccine (i.e.,no medical limitations) and did not. That will never happen, but it should. It ain't cheap trying to keep people with severe covid alive."
2021-04-21 13:50,My only question is when will the vaccine move from emergency approval to fully licensed by the FDA? We will never get ahead of these mutations and the expense of development and mass distribution until it becomes Mandatory and only a small percentage of the population will seek court approval to not get vaccinated.
2021-04-21 13:57,"Vaccines are not as you say widely available.  Appointments just opened up very recently in most states and just this week on several states.  People are trying to get appointments but it’s not exactly easy without driving an hour or going to a mass vaccination site where there will be crowds and there may be reluctance to enter an unvaccinated crowd to get a vaccine.

Most appointments for recently opened states are into May and even June.   Let’s wait four to six weeks and see where we are.  Might be better to start rolling vaccine to pharmacies and PCPs so those that don’t want to risk a mass site can get one more easily.

For the true reluctant, come September 1, we need to put in indoor dining, mass entertainment event, air travel restrictions for those who will have, by then, made an active choice to not get vaccinated.

And if the states below the Mason-Dixon Line continue to lag, other states should put in place true incoming travel restrictions or enforced quarantine for travel to/from those states where vaccination rates remain low."
2021-04-21 13:58,"There's not really an incentive to get one. Before the vaccine it was sold as the end of masks, social distancing and lock downs but even after half of the adult population getting a shot there are warnings of new lockdowns and masks still being a requirement. I have no reason to go out of my way to get it outside of my own health which judging by the amount of BBQ I eat isn't that big of concern."
2021-04-21 13:59,"A reserve officer told me the military. Could not mandate the vaccine until it had full FDA approval, not just emergency approval. I suspect that is true of other places of employment. When will that happen? I’m appalled when I go to a medical office and speak to health care providers/employees who are not vaccinated. Most require an annual flu shot. We need to get to herd immunity and the issue of only emergency approval appears to be holding us back.

I’m in favor of vaccination only restaurant seating, movie theatre, flight... vaccination passports if you want to call it that."
2021-04-21 14:09,"The first thing they need to do is reward people for getting vaccinated by letting us return to our lives.  That means vaccine passports.  So that concerts and shows and restaurants can distinguish between the vaccinated and unvaccinated. 

I realize there's a level of unfairness there.  But no one needs to be able to eat indoors.   Many of us have lived without it for over a year.  Letting the vaccinated in would encourage other people to get vaccinated.  Which would help everyone. 

The sooner we reach herd immunity, the better for everyone.  Including the anti-vaxxers."
2021-04-21 14:10,"The war analogy is inappropriate. Framing the situation in terms of behavioral economics is more accurate. The people who've already received their doses have done so because for them the incentives outweigh the negatives. Aspects such as social acceptance, decreased anxiety over disease contraction, increased physical movement and the good feeling of protecting others are enough to create a tipping point for some. These are all positive incentives. Deliberating over the implementation of negative motivators for the reluctant (vaccine passports, movement restrictions, social stigma, framing them as enemies in a war, etc.) will not produce the desired outcome--we're dealing with people, not targets. We need to consider a different set of incentives for the currently reluctant. I don't know about others, but that $5 coupon they give out at my nearest Target when you get a flu shot has always been a draw for me. These are the lines we should be thinking along, calibrated to local and regional interests, concerns and needs."
2021-04-21 14:12,"We’re close to all who want the vaccine being able to get one. If you don’t want one, that’s your choice. 
There’s no rationale to infringe on people’s freedom by needing any kind of proof of vaccination at that point. Those who have chosen against it are accepting the risks. Those who have received it are protected. 
There’ll be no way to enforce or monitor the yearly boosters etc and it won’t be feasible to shut down businesses for months every year until all can again receive this years shot. 

Just like from the beginning, there’s no absolutes. You can’t manage your way out of having a chance of contracting the virus. You can only mitigate your risk, if you feel like your personal risk is such that the vaccine makes sense for you."
2021-04-21 14:13,"Two comments:

1.  They just opened it up for all adults.   There are still huge numbers of people who are desperately trying to get appointments, so they'll go ahead at full speed for at least a month or two.   Momentum is your friend, if everybody's doing it, maybe everyone will do it.

2. Dr. William Schaffner is a medical doctor.   He is not a lawyer or a scholar of constitutional law, so his opinion on whether vaccination can be required or not is of no value.  The courts and the lawyers will decide whether vaccination is a personal choice or not."
2021-04-21 14:29,"Agree with those who are pointing out that even with a good supply of doses, availability is still not all that widespread.  I was able to get an appointment for my first dose within about two weeks of becoming eligible, but my employer is flexible on schedule and I've got good transportation and I spent a lot of time checking for open appointments.  Without a flexible schedule and good transportation or just being less motivated to squeeze into an available appointment I'd be waiting a solid 5+ weeks for my first dose.

The idea that ""every adult can get a vaccine dose"" won't really be correct until sometime in June."
2021-04-21 14:31,"Many states just opened to all adults this Monday, two days ago. Besides that, it's still not necessarily easy to find appointments in many places, and the appointments that are available are often in areas that require a car to access. I just got my first dose over the weekend, and it required driving 40 minutes (one way) to a NY state vaccination site; I was able to book my husband an appointment but not until the following day so we did another 40 minute drive for his appointment. We were only able to do that because we own a vehicle, and we wanted vaccines enough to be willing to go out of our way for them. If you want all Americans to get vaccinated, make it easy by offering walk-in appointments at pharmacies like the flu shot."
2021-04-21 14:37,"Most of the reluctance is cultural. Those who have a cultural identity that gives little credence to science, and a habit of accepting opinion as fact, a prone to manipulation by the voices that surround them. 

But there is hope. As more people are vaccinated, their island of disinformation gets smaller and smaller. And thus, they may be persuaded."

2021-04-21 13:31,"To quote Forrest Gump, “Stupid is as stupid does.”"
2021-04-21 14:48,"It's just not easy to land an appointment, at least here in Oregon. I placed my name on three lists, one the official state list (getvaccinated.oregon.gov) dictated by ""lottery"" to no avail.The other two dead end lists were based on leftover vaccine availability and the pharmacy appointments were never available. Three weeks later i finally landed an appointment an hour and a half drive away thru a different channel targeted for a city other then mine. The process was wildly uncoordinated, random and confusing. For as much as they talk the talk I sensed a lack of urgency on the part of Oregon. They simply are not making it easy to get the jab."
2021-04-21 14:48,"The vaccine makers need to get full FDA approval vs emergency authorization.  At that point businesses, the military, etc could require folks to get vaccinated."
2021-04-21 14:49,"Make it easier then. I've been trying to get my husband, who is reluctant, an appointment on the weekend. I'm not going to create an account at ever local pharmacy or grocery store just to see if they may have a weekend appointment. Make this easier. The pop up, drive through sites are great, but you can't just show up. Make it easier."

2021-04-21 14:55,"Soon it will be time, perhaps, for insurance companies to assist in pushing the vaccination effort forward by raising health insurance rates for those who refuse vaccination without a valid excuse after a date to be determined."
2021-04-21 14:57,"I was planning on attending a conference in Atlanta in October. I say ""was"" because at the current level of vaccination there I will almost certainly not be going anywhere near Georgia or other similarly situated states for, at a minimum, quite some time. I do not believe that the organization or any other organization has a legal responsibility to warn prospective attendees of the vaccination rate and/or the prevalence of Coronavirus/Covid-19 in places where it plans to hold conferences, but I believe that it has a moral duty to do so, at least for the foreseeable future. To put attendees in peril, especially those who cannot be vaccinated for medical reasons, would make the organization complicit in their sickness or demise."
2021-04-21 13:21,"Mentioned on MSNBC this AM (so it’s not just me). Try finding a vaccine in the northern Virginia area. Rollout has been suboptimal for quite some time now.
 
Wrangled with computer signup, availability and finally strategy on Sunday. Drove 2.5 hrs to rural southern Virginia yesterday (Tuesday).

If it is this difficult to get a vaccine when you: have access to all resources, disposable time and income, have technical and medical knowledge, are mentally and physically able — and finally do “want” a vaccine — maybe the barrier is not so much the desire to receive a vaccine."
2021-04-21 14:10,"A year ago, near the start of the pandemic’s outbreak, San Mateo County health official Dr. Scott Morrow said that those who refused to wear masks and otherwise follow Covid protocols were spitting in the faces of those who did. I can only imagine the appropriate metaphor to describe those who are “reluctant” to get vaccinated, thereby further disrespecting the safety and welfare of their fellow American citizens. As we are now learning, with vaccine supply outstripping demand, so-called herd immunity will never be reached. Once again, our endless loop of stupidity will result in an endless loop of the pandemic. So it goes."
2021-04-21 14:46,"To the citizens of Georgia, Alabama, and Mississippi, as well as other people who are choosing not to get vaccinated:  A virus does not care about your religious, political or new age nonsense about the dangers of vaccines.  It will go on infecting people, and if we learned anything from the great 1918 flu pandemic, if we let this virus hang around, it may potentially evolve into something far deadlier.  We cannot afford to take such a chances."
2021-04-21 15:08,Easy.  6 months of free basic cable in exchange for solid proof of vaccination. Done.
2021-04-21 13:24,"As more Americans get vaccinated, when the numbers are released daily how many deaths: The states should add how many deaths were in people that were unvaccinated, vs. how many deaths were in people vaccinated.
After a short while the numbers should remind the unvaccinated they are the vast majority of deaths from Covid 19"
2021-04-21 13:20,It’s time to start withholding tax refunds or imposing punitive taxes on people who refuse to be vaccinated.  This is madness.
2021-04-21 14:31,"Would it be too much for Donald J. Trump and his wife to film a public service announcement encouraging their faithful followers to get themselves vaccinated?

Sigh, apparently that is too much to ask ... because promoting a vaccine that Donald wants to personally take credit for developing ... and which he and Melania have already received .... will make them look ... weak, or something?  I honestly don't get it.

I so wish that DJT showed some empathy for something else besides his own ego and his own media image.  He has the power to save, literally, thousands of American lives with a single PSA.  

If I had that power, I would seize it in a heartbeat."
2021-04-21 15:06,"States should adopt a policy that people listed as registered Republicans are not allowed vaccinations. That will start a GOP ""freedom to receive vaccines"" movement and get them vaccinated."
2021-04-21 13:57,Unvaccinated people who spread variants that can kill vaccinated individuals is simply not fair so passports and mandates are necessary.
2021-04-21 13:26,"How to convince people? Stop trying to force them to get it, especially via employer mandates. We know there's is a virus. We hear about it 24-7. Allow people to make their own decision. And  cease and desist with all the pictures of injections. Many people are terrified of needles and these images are not helping."
2021-04-21 14:34,At facilities here in Philly many people have told me there is tons of spare capacity. We suffered through this for more than a year. Let’s end this awful episode. Let’s get the shots to people who want to get them.
2021-04-21 15:06,"If after a certain amount of time a person has not taken the vaccine, please make sure that the rest of us don’t subsidize their vent."
2021-04-21 15:08,"Many people, even those who have gotten the vaccine, question the efficacy of the whole effort.

But right now the vaccine is the best weapon that we have got against what was an unexpected enemy.

If we are not in this fight in unity, we are doomed to ongoing retreat.

No one is saying that the vaccine is the end all, but at least it represents direction.

And, those willing to get vaccinated in hope of protection of not only self but the greater populace are the true, tough warriors, as opposed to the cowards who have succumbed to the rumor/fear mongers and are doing the nation a disservice."
2021-04-21 13:32,"Here is a clue for the people who can't figure out why some are reluctant to get an experimental vaccine.  Stop telling them they can't have their lives back even if they do.  That is the messaging a lot of people are hearing, go get vaccinated but you still have to do all the same things you have been all along.  Add to that that many adults have low risk from COVID anyway and many already had it.... gee yeah why would they think maybe they don't want this... I wonder."
2021-04-21 14:29,"I am going for my first shot today and will get fully immunized. Yes, this is hand to hand combat, my wife would rather trust anonymous internet trolls over scientists and her husband of over 19 years. We have had some lively debates, first COVID is a left-wing conspiracy to make Trump look bad, it would disappear as soon as Democrats were in office, to the shot is to control people. Every time, facts overtake her arguments, so she finds new ones online. I love her and it wasn't always this way, when we were married, we both were very non-political. But the internet and right-wing media has poisoned her mind. I love my wife very much and I don't want to pick on her, she too is a victim. She has been manipulated by right-wingers who don't have her best interest in mind, only theirs. Without addressing fairness, and outlawing untruthful media, we won't win this fight, ever. It's almost like we're fighting WW2, and at the same time allowing Tokyo Rose and Axis Annie to dominate our media landscape. The first amendment does have limits, and I believe this is one of them. If my wife gets COVID or dies from it without being immunized, I'm blaming Fox News, Alex Jones, and the right-wing industrial brainwashing complex, not her."

Weekly meeting had a portion dedicated to what states had shots available at what age and web sites to sign up to for the shots. What brought all this change about that resulted in everyone in the offices are 100% vaccinated? The boss' friend died of CV very early in the pandemic and apparently it was a serious wake up call.
2021-04-21 14:03,"“the challenge was not being dogmatic in a public awareness campaign, but treating every person’s concern as unique and valid.”  — But every person’s concern about getting the vaccine is NOT valid.  Sometimes there are right and wrong answers.   This is never going to end if red states have such low vaccination rates."
2021-04-21 14:21,"This is what needs to happen:

1. Republican leaders need to band together and start a Republicans for Covid-19 immunization group with hard core advocacy and advertising. Republican leaders who refuse to do this should be put on the spot as to why they won’t participate.

2. Donald Trump needs more pressure to do advocacy and advertising. He can single-handedly save in an enormous number of lives and to not do so is shameful. Although  he shouldn’t be shamed into doing it, extraordinary efforts should be utilized to get him on board. Say how great Operation Warp Speed is or whatever it takes to grease is ego or otherwise kiss his ring ad nauseam- but get him on board! 

3. Vaccine passports or the equivalent should be encouraged, not shied  away from. Individuals and businesses should have the right to protect their employees and customers. For example, AAA in Washington State has a recording on their emergency line which states that during the pandemic tow truck drivers will not take passengers in the truck when they tow a vehicle. On the one hand that’s perhaps understandable. However, if drivers and passengers were immunized that rule would not make any sense.

4. Furthermore, governors like DeSantis and Abbott should be totally ashamed of themselves for executive orders banning vaccine passports. This is no more than a political stunt and they know it! Vaccine passports, although not perfect, appear to be working very well in Israel."
2021-04-21 15:02,The real reason for vaccine hesitancy is not a lack of education or access. Some people just don't want it. And they deserve to choose what to do with their own bodies and not be shamed or berated because they decided against it.
2021-04-21 14:28,"Maybe you haven't heard; the vaccine has been ridiculously difficult to get for a lot of people in rural areas. Many people that wanted it were unable to get it, even after trying to jump through all the hoops. Only just recently is it finally getting more easy to get vaccinated.

It also doesn't help when public health officials, doctors, and the media give mixed messages. As an example, a lot of people have autoimmune disorders, and not giving people in this category any guidance and information and considering risk factors when administering the vaccine to them doesn't build trust and confidence. A previously published article in the NYT's quoted one doctor as saying that immunocompromised people should probably be prioritized for getting optimally timed two dose vaccines, yet we have been told all along to get the Johnson and Johnson if that's the one available to you."
2021-04-21 13:40,Add to vaccine hesitancy in this country the fact that a very small percentage of the world’s population has been vaccinated and it could take years to do so.  This pandemic isn’t ending.  Don’t kid yourself.
2021-04-21 14:34,"We're not going to end up anywhere near herd immunity, so get ready for what's happening in India and Brazil to happen here. 

Republicans may be easy to fool, but Nature cannot be fooled. This virus will rip through unvaccinated, non-immune people, causing economic and social wreckage in addition to more direct suffering and death, to the exact degree we allow it to. It's that simple. 

Stop distancing and masking, refuse vaccines? To the extent that pool is vulnerable, it'll rip through. With every single replication selective pressure to evade distancing and masking by becoming more infectious or to evade immunity becomes more likely--up to the exact degree of biological flexibility of the virus's genome.

Getting vaccinated is not a free choice. Your actions affect others, both directly and indirectly. So, no libertarian in history would justify refusing to get a vaccine, just as they don't justify the ""right"" to walk into a mall and start shooting because it's your gun, after all.

There is only one thinker I know of who would justify such an action, and that's the Marquis de Sade, who explicitly (and honestly) recommended that personal whim-freedom was absolute, no matter what harm it did to others.

Big shock that that's the real reigning philosopher of the Republican Party nowadays."

That might bring some of the anti-vaxxers to their senses.
Vaccine passports will the solution and they should be required for all public events and places, including bars, restaurants and entertainment, sports venues, trains and planes. 
Anti-vaxxers can then hang out with their own kind only."
2021-04-21 14:02,"Ughh. This is a global pandemic raging worldwide for over a year now. What kind of country lacks the legislative will to mandate vaccines as a public health measure?? Those who refuse vaccines are essentially the modern equivalent of Typhoid Mary, and fertile grounds for new Covid-19 variants (via mutation) that may be resistant to the current vaccines, thereby endangering the sane part of the country that has been vaccinated. State governments have the ability, but apparently not the will, to invoke their authority to mandate vaccines as a public health measure and to forcibly quarantine those who refuse to comply (except for those with bona fide medical contraindications). The federal government has that same ability to do so by invoking its powers under the Commerce Clause (because, obviously, this global pandemic has disrupted interstate commerce).

Absent a demonstrated willingness to take strong steps to safeguard the health of its citizens, the state and federal governments merely confirm their profound failure to govern, along with other such failures as the failure to reign in and criminalize domestic terrorism, the failure to enact meaningful gun regulations, and others."
2021-04-21 14:10,"De- politicize the whole issue. From Day 1 this has been the biggest mistake in our handling of COVID. It’s public health, pure and simple. The messengers need to be trusted people, from Doctors to pastors to athletes, not our politicians who seem to thrive on demonizing the  “others”. I think tobacco was a good analogy. Employers and schools also have a role to play. It should be a condition of employment for teachers, health care workers and customer facing employees. Let’s end this cycle of lock downs."
2021-04-21 13:32,"I do not understand people's reluctance to get vaccinated.

Having said that, there are various things that those of us who believe in science can do.  First, we can refuse to travel to states that do not meet herd immunity criteria.  This will mean an over-inclusive list of states to boycott, because I don't believe what many red state governors say, but so be it.  If one teaches people to believe lies, one cannot control which lies they will believe.  If they believe Trump won the election, they will also believe that he conquered Covid.

Second, the FAA can require proof of vaccination in order for a prospective passenger to fly.  The articles that claim that such orders impinge on individual freedom feed the idea that refusing a vaccine is a matter of autonomy.  What about my freedom to travel safely?  It's freedom from vaccination versus freedom from exposure (given that vaccines are not 100% effective).  it's freedom against freedom.  Given that getting Covid is a lot worse than getting the vaccine, the balance is clear.  (BTW, freedom to carry a gun versus freedom from being shot is another one.  It's not freedom versus regulation, it's freedom versus freedom.)

Third, just let the red state doubters get Covid.  Maybe then they will learn to view medical care as a necessity and support Medicare for all.

 Incidentally, I already refuse to visit any red states.  Especially ones that are trying to take the vote away from minorities and Democrats."
2021-04-21 13:39,"News flash: many people don’t trust the pharmaceutical industry, due to their track record of concealing side-effects, over-promising benefits, inflated costs, and more.  Also: pharmaceutical advertising *especially the ads for vaccines* present vaccination as just another individual consumer choice.  And the people in the ads (actors acting) tend to be overly simple and often befuddled, compliant patsies, which really doesn’t help."
2021-04-21 14:57,"With the wide availability of the vaccines this is no longer an excuse for not getting vaccinated. We cannot risk new variants taking hold and rendering the present vaccines useless. Vaccination needs to be mandated by law, no vaccination, no entry to public places such as office buildings, restaurants, bars, gyms and publics venues such as sports arenas. You would not be permitted on planes, trains or buses. The needs of the many far outweigh the personal objections of the few. We are talking about life and death here.
  And it appalling that trump would refuse to do an ad to promote vaccinating."
2021-04-21 13:26,"It's simple. Treat this like we did with measles, polio, and smallpox. If you want your child to go to school, the parents must be vaccinated. (And when vaccines are approved for children, they must be vaccinated too.) If you want to attend a major league baseball game, you must be vaccinated. If you want to go to a Broadway show or a Las Vegas casino, you must be vaccinated. This also means we will need a privately developed ""vaccine passport"" app for our cell phone proving our status. But none of this is mandatory, so the ""hesitant"" can always opt out."
2021-04-21 13:40,"I have no doubt that it will be truly accidental if the US reaches herd immunity. A sizable percentage of our population doesn't believe that the pandemic is real, and/or that the vaccines work, and/or that the vaccines are safe, and/or some concocted conspiracy theory on the web. If over half a million dead Americans aren't a sufficient inducement, nothing is.

We can not force people to get vaccinated.

I'm fearful that the US will be an incubator for variants and that one will have all the truly horrifying characteristics: easily spread, very lethal, and not susceptible to our current vaccines."

War may be over, give peace a chance?"

We own our own bodies, not the media, our neighbor, or our boss. Most available vaccines aren't required, and this one hasn't even been approved by the FDA yet. Lack of education isn't the reason they don't wish to get it. We may want to believe that, but the real reason is they just don't want it (at least not now.)"

One for the vaccinated, the other higher cost would be for the unvaccinated.    Or they could put riders in their policies excluding payment for COVID19 so unvaccinated people would have to pay out of pocket for all covid19 costs.  Why should those who have taken the vaccine have to pay for those who did not and contracted covid19."
2021-04-21 13:39,"Vaccination sites at airports and train stations would be great. It should really be mandatory to be vaccinated to fly. Also, what about parents of children that are in school - they should absolutely have to get vaccinated. I can somewhat understand people's hesitancy to get the vaccine - there's just so much misinformation out there and people are scared. But this is what I've told people I know that don't want to get it... Do you eat fast food and sugar? Drink or smoke? Drive a car? These are all dangerous activities that poorly affect human health. So what are you really afraid of getting from the vaccine, if you're willing to engage in these activities that can cause all sorts of problems and lead to death?"

We were once a nation that transformed private industry to support the war effort, where Rosie the Riveter was an icon of sacrifice for the greater good.  Now, we are a country where half of us won't even bother wear a mask, or get vaccinated to help our fellow Americans.  Do we no longer believe in the greater good?  Is it political polarization?  People no longer think they bear any responsibility to help the war effort.  Whatever the reason, it breaks my heart."
2021-04-21 13:37,"Many need to be shamed. They are purposely prolonging the pandemic restrictions and should be publicly called out.

2021-04-21 13:53,What is not mentioned here is that the virus is not a US phenomenon.  It is worldwide.  Any country that doesn't work towards herd immunity puts their fellow citizens of the world at risk.  China was vilified for its initial poor  communications and lack of openness about the virus.  Does the US want to be the source for the next round of virus mutations that may not respond well to current vaccines?  It may be be much more complex than that but that may be the legacy of all those who can safely get the vaccine but refuse to do so.  Individual rights go so far but at some point they run up against the greater needs of society.
2021-04-21 14:22,"There has to be more benefit to take what some feel is a risky step - more tangible incentive, more reason to do it.

We have lived through a year of siege, being told disaster and horrible suffering/death was just a moment away, and the truth is - the majority of Americans either did not get Covid, or got over it with mild to moderate symptoms.  

The majority of Americans did not die, nor were seriously sick from Covid.  That is simply reality.   Yes, over 3 million worldwide have died, but the majority of people have not even gotten sick.

I am glad to be fully vaccinated because I watched family members get very sick last fall, but as an essential worker, I never isolated, did not change my routine much, never needed a Covid based on exposure, I did not get sick. 

I made it to vaccination without personally knowing Covid.  
I am not unique.

But now what?  I still wear a mask, socially isolate, can't really travel, am advised not to eat out or get together in groups. 

I understand the situation, I really do, but on an emotional level, I can also understand why some are weighing the risk of the vaccination vs their risk from Covid, and questioning the benefits outweigh the risk.

If politicians want more people to choose the vaccine, they need to provide more tangible benefits to the vaccinated.  

How about opening up the Canadian border today to those who are vaccinated?"
2021-04-21 13:57,"As is usually the case, Republicans make up the majority of those who are making what is probably a bad decision and who in any event are are making it on the basis of socio-political rancor and misinformation.

You are not forced to be vaccinated, but you are prohibited from indoor public space, exactly like smoking bans. 
The risk for a vaccine resistant variant which sends us back to last year, or spreads to poorer countries and causes millions of deaths is what's at stake. 
The big question will be whether there are federal mandates or the government leaves it up to the states. Biden doesn't want to face this decision, since he'd have to choose saving lives, vs reelection. So expect a huge push for voluntary vaccination led by the federal government. There needs to be a massive public relations campaign. Which Fox News employees did not get vaccinated? Could the New York Times please do a story on that."

The US government should require that all government employees be vaccinated, to protect the public and other employees.

If children are not vaccinated but get sick and hospitalized, the parents should be charged with child abuse.  If the child dies, the charge should be homicide.

Our country sank to a new low in exhibiting irrational behavior, to the shame of us all.  I had hoped for a recovery with a new President, but I see the arrogant, irrational behavior infected others and is spreading to state legislatures as reported in other articles about limiting protests, gerrymandering, and voter suppression."

2021-04-21 15:19,"An analogy from polio eradication efforts in Pakistan 20 years ago might be more useful than the hand-to-hand combat analogy that many commenters are finding objectionable.  

Mass polio vaccination sites where people came to us were useful but these were the easy-to-reach children whose families were eager for them to be vaccinated.  Hard-to-reach children were missed and the epidemic raged on.  

Ultimately, these efforts had to be supplemented with a ""child-to-child"" campaign in which mobile teams of vaccinators go out to people in their homes, train stations, brick factories employing child labor, etc. to encourage vaccination.  I see those parallels in what's being suggested in this article."

2021-04-21 15:45,"Vaccine passports would help. Once there is a tangible benefit to getting vaccinated people will get vaccinated. No proof of vaccination and you can't go to a bar or restaurant, you can't go to sporting events, theaters, concerts or anywhere you can't social distance. No air, train or bus travel for you.  You can go shopping but a mask is required while the vaccinated can forego if they choose. Levy insurance premium surcharges for those who put themselves at risk with higher co-pays for covid treatments. You will need to be vaccinated for your children to go back to class and when a vaccine is available for them, they well need to be vaccinated. Be prepared to quarantine for two weeks if you travel to a state that prohibits vaccine passports. If you have a legitimate medical exemption you can participate if masked. Religious objection, your only concession is you are free to attend religious services. How many  are willing to put up with those things just to avoid vaccination?"
2021-04-21 15:49,"In my small rural and mostly white community, appointments just aren’t readily available. I drove three hours round trip to get both of my vaccine doses and was extremely happy to receive them. However, a friend has been on the in-town waitlist for weeks to get theirs. I recommended they contact the health facility I visited and they were able to get an appointment the next day. 

Perhaps the remainder of people would get vaccinated if the appointment availability and scheduling was more convenient in rural areas? Not everyone wants to drive that far, especially those who may be on the fence to get vaccinated at all."

It's hard to plan a trip knowing that you may, even if already vaccinated as I am, be exposed to more virulent variants.

The solution probably involves ""making"" people get vaccinated.  Require vaccination to do all kinds of stuff (fly, work, send kids to school, go to movies) so that people like the above can get vaccinated because ""they"" made me - without conceding anything."

Yet we, those of us wise enough to heed the science, struggle to ""understand"" the arrogance and/or stupidity of the ""reluctant"".  Particularly the ""reluctant"" who all along have treated the reality of a public health emergency as some issue of political ideology.

As the vaccine is now more and more available to all who want it have we not reached the point where individual refusal to accept it is not a societal ""problem"" but a ""solution""?"

As far as Concerts and Sporting Events and even Bars are concerned many business owners large and small are already asking for some sort of hard to fake proof of vaccination so they can operate at capacity without fear.

Schools as well, for instance Rutgers here in NJ, have Vaccine Mandate to get on Campus as student, staff or teacher. 

Not to mention the Cruise Industry and other parts of travel industry in general.

And at the end of the day it's absolutely clear that without such a system and without pain for the vaccine refusers via being banned from much of normal life we will NEVER get to herd immunity and stop the mutations that will inevitably start this nightmare over given enough time.

Requiring Vaccine is not a new thing in America. You cannot teach, work or attend most schools without childhood vaccines. You cannot serve in the Military without certain vaccines. You cannot travel to certain Countries without proof of certain vaccines. And it's already abundantly clear just about every Country is going to add Covid Vaccine to that list of ""required vaccines to come here"".

I have lost so much faith in conventional medicine, and it has failed me my entire life. If I am diagnosing myslef before a doctor, because they have failed to properly treat and test me, maybe we need a national conversation about it. I am not alone.

I point out that the flu shot they get contains tiny amounts of deactivated  flu viruses. The flu nasal spray contains live viruses that have been weakened. The polio shot they got was an inactivated polio virus.  The Diphtheria, Pertussis & Tetanus vaccine they received  incorporates toxoids and killed bacteria from the 3 different bacteria which cause the 3 diseases.    Then I've explained to them that the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines do not contain the virus, dead or weakened, but rather a blueprint to train your cells to build a protein that the immune system will then react to, in order to prepare a defense against the virus if you are ever exposed to it.

But anyway - in any area where the geography makes it possible, the warehouses should be underground or at least partially underground, and require lots'n'lots of insulation.  That should lower operating costs and reduce power consumption.

Any cold-storage structure should also be grid-connected in such a way that it participates in demand management, so during peak demand they reduce power consumption.

The thermal inertia once one of these buildings gets frozen is immense, so thawing isn't the kind of thing that's a risk over the course of a hot day.  When they turned the Fulton Cold Storage building here into the Chicago HQ for Google, they had to let it sit a while after knocking holes in the walls just so the overall structure could thaw."

2021-04-20 18:10,"As a child in the 1940's, I remember the big downtown community freezer.  All the farms in the area rented a space.  If you butchered a hog or a steer, you'd get it cut up, wrapped in paper, and put it in the freeze.  I remember putting on a very heavy coat to get ready to dash in and find, say, a roast.  The refrigerant was ammonia: the smell made you sick if you stayed to long.  Are we coming back to those days?"

I grow, can, and freeze homemade food from the garden, that’s productive use of electricity and cold storage."
2021-04-21 13:41,"Last year we purchased 2 large chest freezers as we ended up raising 30 additional meat chickens, 2 hogs, and the annual deer we harvested off our property. This year we plan for the same with an elk as well... This meat will be enough to last a family of SIX for the entire year.

Don't be fooled into believing that freezer is what Americans are full of... Because it isn't.

There's coming a time when the U.S. dollar will fail and the shelves at the grocery store will be emptied (we saw it for the first time last year briefly) - so the question isn't will it happen... It's WHEN will it happen and are you prepared?

For most Americans, sadly the answer is no."

They were moving at least a 100 people through the center every 15 minutes when it was operational."
2021-04-22 13:19,"This is a classic ethical example of a decision that trades off individual tragedy for the greater common good. The United States tends more toward valuing the individual than the community, and the moment more than the future. In my opinion, we overweight the tragic deaths of a few versus the statistical inevitably of more unknown deaths from Covid-19 in the future for the unvaccinated. A similar effect is seen with the individuals who think the “liberty” of being asked to wear an uncomfortable mask outweighs the collective risk of the community. American individualism can provide great benefit, but often at great cost."

2021-04-22 13:48,I cannot find anywhere in the article a reference to how many people suffer from the same condition without having been vaccinated. I did read somewhere else that there are always some of these rare cases even without the vaccine. Other questions include whether the clotting might actually be a rare side effect of COVID itself since none of the vaccines are 100% effective. There are other questions also that a better researched article could address.
2021-04-22 14:50,"As best as I can tell from the lay press, this either represents a condition, Thrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura (TTP) or Heparin Induced Thrombocytopenia (HIT).  Both are exceedingly rare even in the absence of vaccine and rapidly progressive if not recognized by physicians.  Most General Internists would not initially realize what is happening and would treat the clotting disorder with heparin, which could make it worse.

The pause is occurring to collect information and educate physicians as to the nature of this disorder and its correct treatment.  With TTP it is plasmapheresis and plasma exchange, with HIT, it's avoidance of heparin and use of alternative, less commonly use anticoagulants like argatroban. 

Since heparin is so commonly used in ICUs, most Critical Care physicians are familiar with HIT and monitor heparin antibodies in anyone with a falling platelet count.  This is not that common, and would not necessarily be known by all physicians.  So the pause is to acquire further knowledge, assure the safety of the vaccine, and disseminate information to physicians."

There’s no reason why the United States is continuing to put the vaccine on hold, other than the fact that we have an overly zealous CDC director who is strangely hellbent on using terms like ‘impending doom’ while creating even more vaccine fears and delaying an end to the pandemic. Wallensky is apparently oblivious to the destruction she and her complicit colleagues are causing. One blood clot in a million cases should not create hysteria, fear, and the continuation of a deadly pandemic. I hope the unused vaccines, if not administered in America, will be redistributed to countries that need them."

2021-04-22 15:34,"I would love to read a well researched article about Covid and the Covid vaccines that studies the link between obesity and reactions.  It seems that, because it may be politically incorrect or cringe worthy, the medical science and the media are ignoring it.  I have seen lots of anecdotal information, including a photo of the young woman who died from blood clots after receiving the J&J vaccine, but nothing more.
In truth, we have an obesity epidemic and health is endangered because of it.  Perhaps by presenting evidence of linkage we could finally get to a place where healthy lifestyles are vigorously encouraged (but body shaming is not)."
2021-04-22 16:27,"I know this might sound callous to the individuals who have experienced these blood clots. It is not intended.

My thought is:  if we took gun violence as seriously as we do this issue, we could have saved hundreds of thousands of lives.

We have in fact lost lives in our desperate search for vaccines and therapies, with convalescent serum, hydroxychloroquine, remdesivir, Regeneron and all the shots, noting the anaphylaxis episodes when Pfizer and Moderna came out.

But we have some quixotic responses, too, calls for mandated “vaccine passports” while the shots remain experimental on the one hand, yet countries stopping campaigns altogether because of a rare event on the other. I happen to think patients should be informed about known side effects and consent of their own free will as we proceed with inoculations, understanding these aren’t absolutely safe while the FDA monitors them for excessive risk. Maybe I’m old-fashioned; from a day when we went to the airport unafraid even though a plane crash or a terrorist came on the news every month or so."
2021-04-22 17:52,"Blood clots are certainly a devastating reaction but they are also very rare.  The risk of dying from a reaction to this vaccine is far lower than the risk associated with every firearm that is sold, yet we still allow firearms to be sold.  The vaccine is far more necessary than firearms are.  It should continue to be made available."

2021-04-22 21:08,It seems like the vaccine is producing clotting in the same way as COVID-19.  If the goal is to get the immune system to recognize COVID-19 is it a surprise that some people might get blood clots (or unusual bleeding) from the vaccine?  Genuinely curious.

Perhaps some revealing things about how the doctor proceeded, about how the patient's condition proceeded, perhaps ANYTHING except what the bulk of it is- a rehash of public positions on the difficulties with the J&J vaccine.  There was potential here- potential to talk about incompetence in the government even as the leaders preach cooperation; potential for understanding how a doctor works through such a difficult diagnosis and plan of care.  Nope, just more public relations pablum."
2021-04-23 3:15,"No where in this article does the name of the syndrome appear. It is Vaccine Induced  immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia or VITT. It appears to be due to abnormal levels of an antibodies to Platelet Factor 4 seen also in some patients on heparin. For a science based understanding refer to the Editorial of Cines and Bussel in the NEJM dated April 16,  2021.  As with so much other information that we have had to process as a society in the last year, we should be wary of speculating on or attributing a relationship between COVID infections, vaccines or treatments to diseases that occurred randomly before this horrible plague. In this case again the incidence could simply be random. Only time and science will tell. Anyone not getting the vaccine using this as an excuse is risking not only their lives but also the lives around them."

Whether to drink, or not, is right up there with all the other shot-info, like, ""don't take ibuprofen before the shot"" + ""it's OK to take ibuprofen before the shot"" = ""we just don't know for sure.""

For example, I am fully vaccinated.  If I drink 4-5 beers with my friends (who are all also vaccinated), does that mean the alcohol in my system puts me at risk temporarily (until I am no longer hungover), or am I doing permanent damage to the vaccine?  

Hopefully, it's just a temporary inhibitor."

2021-04-27 13:52,"It's moderation. ""Heavy alcohol consumer, particularly over the long term, can suppress the immune system and potentially interfere with your vaccine response."" This makes sense to me. It takes a couple weeks after the second Covid vaccine for the body to generate the protection needed to fight off a Covid attack. During this time, if you're drinking 5 beers per night, you're probably inhibiting the effectiveness of the vaccine. That means it takes your body longer to generate the protection needed to fight back the viral attack. But if you're having 5 beers per week, I suspect that has almost no impact on the effectiveness of the vaccine."
2021-04-27 13:53,I had a celebratory glass of wine the night of my first shot and the headache that followed the next morning caused me to abstain for a couple days before and after the 2nd.  You need hydration and electrolytes and alcohol depletes.  It wasn't about my immune system; it was about avoiding severe side effects.
2021-04-27 13:55,"I understand that articles like this probably mean well, but my goodness. The trouble with these ""avoid-this-or-that-before-or-after-covid-vaccine"" is that the clinical trials didn't control for everything under the sun - nor can they! Every body has it's own experience, and these trials test for safety in a general population. Imagine the madness of controlling for every substance that can be consumed! Articles like this one, then, take already available info and apply it haphazardly to covid vaccines. Let's give the people a break! Our bodies are miracles, and it's time to have faith in them, and in our common sense for their care. 

Yes, alcohol is bad. Or it's good. Just like coffee. Or eggs. The science around these things changes all the time. What we know for certain is that we only have the one life, and it's enjoyable to consume things we enjoy. Practice moderation, or, gasp, even immoderation moderately, and you'll likely be physically fine, and more likely, personally fulfilled. 

It's sad how much anxiety well meaning articles like this one have caused around the vaccine. We're told for a year that vaccines will end the pandemic, and then the vaccine arrives, and we're quick to fear monger. What else should we avoid after the jab? Oxygen? Bathing? Shrimp cocktail? What are the effects of sunlight on the vaccinated body? Is it safe to light an aromatherapy candle a day or two after?

(Drinking myself sick is not a regular occurrence with me, happening maybe once a decade; I drink regularly but moderately.) I'm off alcohol until further notice as I haven't felt quite right since then. Undoubtedly the vaccination and alcohol don't mix (at least not for me), and if you add peri-menopausal hormones into the mix, well, I should have seen it coming and been more sensible. In retrospect, I wonder if the vaccination represented the bright, shiny hope for a return to normalcy such that I thought, once the initial reaction was behind me, I didn't have to worry about much more than a hangover. Nope."
2021-04-27 14:33,This is exactly why I chose to leave the craft rum business and write about and embrace cannabis. It also works to relieve the symptoms of my glaucoma. Win win.
2021-04-27 14:33,"The scientific community needs to update its terminology. If four drinks is a health concern, then say that moderate drinking is a health concern - because the public considers 4 drinks once a week to be moderate.

Same goes for obesity. Millions of people do not think they are at risk for covid because the scientific definition of obesity is so different from the public’s understanding of what obesity looks like."
2021-04-27 14:35,"There was an article a while back that addressed what you should or shouldn't do when getting the vaccine, eg don't take ibuprofen before. The medical experts were asked about alcohol, and the recommendation was no alcohol for 24 hours before and after."
2021-04-27 14:35,I actually did drink a glass of wine after vaccination. So I'd say it is no problem.
2021-04-27 14:48,"I'm a moderate drinker by most definitions, and  had a mild reaction -- fever and fatigue for a day and a half -- to each dose of COVID vaccine. While that was going on, alcohol was really the last thing I wanted. Water, seltzer, and lemonade were much more appealing!"
2021-04-27 15:04,"Back in my 40s I was a triathlete and read in of the triathlon publications that by not drinking you body would store more energy and improve your times.
So I quit drinking for a year, and saw no improvement in my times.
So I started to drink moderately again and I noticed a definite improvement in times.
My message - don't believe everything you read..."
2021-04-27 15:15,"A family member drinks heavily several times a week with no apparent hang over. The night of their second Pfizer dose they drank an entire bottle of wine and was horribly ‘hung over’ the next day. Either the alcohol worsened the vaccine side effects or the vaccine worsened the alcohol ‘side effects’. 

I’m 62 and 100 pounds. Moderate drinking for me must be closer to 3 ounces of wine. (It’s the excuse I use to only drink wine I love and not waste my moderate allotment to wine I do not like). I had no alcohol for a several days before and after my first vaccine, but will now hold out longer after my second shot a few days ago."
2021-04-27 15:16,"I would consider this a non-issue story.  Most people should be responsible and have enough commonsense to exercise discretion. I would like to see a story about the US Vaccine Nationalism, which will is likely to have a bigger damage to long term elimination of the virus globally.  It has also negative effect on the long term view of the US in the Global society of allied nations."
2021-04-27 15:25,"If you are upset that this information came out because it will cause ""unnecessary anxiety,"" I wonder if you said the same thing about any of the developing science around COVID and vaccines which did not pertain to alcohol? I mean, it's to everyone's benefit that the vaccines are as effective as possible—it is literally life and death. We should have as much information as possible. What's really the worst that could happen? Responsible people would not drink for a short time in order to maximize the efficacy of the vaccine for themselves and others. But anything to feel okay about that hallowed ""single glass of wine"" that mysteriously litters the comment section of any article that mentions heavy drinking."
2021-04-27 15:44,"They are telling us that now!!  My second shot was two weeks ago and I drink wine at night to curb my evening nerve pain.  Will limit to one glass a night, but would have been nice to know earlier.  It's a balancing act, right??!!"
2021-04-27 11:36,What about marijuana as alternative?
2021-04-27 11:41,"Wow first I'm hearing about this. In Wisconsin, this is a huge concern.

We don't have moderate drinkers. 2 beers a day is a teetotaler. Beer is the morning OJ. Bars opening at 6 am serving breakfast.

Bars here are offering vaccines!

Why hasn't this been published more?"
2021-04-27 12:30,"""...one “standard” drink is considered...12 ounces of beer.""

Some beers have a 3-4% alcohol content, some 10%, that would seem to matter."
2021-04-27 14:35,"This article seems quite misleading. The headline suggests there is evidence that drinking alcohol affects the vaccine in some sort of direct way. But the article seems to say that heavy drinking simply suppresses the immune system, which is relevant whether you have been vaccinated or not. This is sort of like saying you should not eat too much ice cream after getting the vaccine."
2021-04-27 13:48,"My first reaction to this article was worry and despair. It’s already done. I’ve already drank. What have I done?! Recommendations saying we can visit friends and socialize with those who are vaccinated came with wine and cocktails as Colorado thawed out and roof tops of friends began to glow at night again. 

Then I remembered the relief. The feeling of comfort in being vaccinated, and having been hyper vigilant about my own health for over a year, and I had a glass of bourbon. 

Cigarettes used to be good for you, cocaine for toothaches, people used to be afraid of cannabis, which now heals. All this to say, why write an article when the answer is plain and simple: we don’t know. COVID has been an opportunity for a ridiculous amount of speculation, more harmful than useful. Do what makes you happy, eat your fruits and veggies, get some sunshine, drink water, and have a glass or two of wine to celebrate the amazing choice you made to get vaccinated and help us all recover."
2021-04-27 14:27,"Learned little new here - heavy drinking bad, moderate drinking good.  Except that I did not know that a rhesus monkey could be a fun drinking partner.  If I had only known during the pandemic."
2021-04-27 15:18,"Skipped any alcohol the day before, and the day after. No reaction and felt fine. No big deal to it pause."
2021-04-27 13:58,Too late.  People always say this kind of stuff. No data of any kind was offered as evidence. Guess I’ll have to drown my sorrows.
2021-04-27 14:19,"I reacted so severely to both of the Moderna shots for days, I couldn't imagine drinking, so I guess I'm lucky?"
2021-04-27 14:26,This would have been good to know three weeks ago.
2021-04-27 14:31,"This seems a bit late, and not the job of a newspaper -- it should be told to anyone getting the vaccine by the nurse.  I was not told not to drink, nor was anyone I know."
2021-04-27 14:55,"Well, it isn't likely heavy drinking would be recommended would it?  If one doesn't have the common sense to figure this out on their own, then they probably shouldn't be drinking at all!"
2021-04-27 16:02,"None of the cited studies seem to have anything to do with the effect of alcohol consumption on vaccines.    And after over 200,000,000 doses have been given in the US, this ""advice"" is way too late.   What about the mRNA vaccines, which most of us in the US have received?   Are they different because they do not rely on an immune reaction to a killed virus?  This article raises more questions than it answers."
2021-04-27 13:12,"So many variables. I’ll wait two weeks after the second shot then I WILL be drinking that entire bottle of 2004 Cos d'Estournel that is absolutely in it’s prime drinking window right now. Life is about balance. For over a year I’ve been an anxious prisoner to the whims of the gross, the mean and the maskless...but soon I shall call forth the powers of Bacchus!"
2021-04-27 15:44,"It's infuriating that they have this article after so much of the US population already got their shots. I only had a light sore arm and slight fatigue after my first and second shots. I skipped drinking (wine) for the day of the shot, but during the 2 week waiting period have been having 1 to 2 glasses of wine with dinner every night (lived in France for a while). 
Now I have anxiety and stress again instead of relief about the vaccination. The timing of this article is horrible and now I'm wondering if I'll be stuck in a mask until the booster shot comes along."
2021-04-27 15:55,I would personally recommend alcohol before during and after - it's the only way to be sure.
2021-04-27 16:12,"After each of my two injections, I was advised to stay hydrated. While I drink a lot of water daily, I often consume 3-5 pints of beer as well during a typical .

I had the normal reactions of fatigue, aches, etc. after each shot of the Pfizer and am not worried about the silly 2 drink maximum per day and the efficacy of the vaccine when consuming more alcohol. I imagine if one is a bottle a day drinker of high-proof alcohol, one might have problems."
2021-04-27 16:21,"Why is this information first coming out now, after 200 million vaccinations?  I have been vaccinated twice.  The information sent to me cautioned me not to take ibuprofen or aspirin before being vaccinated, and that was the only precaution given.  Do we need do-overs for folks who drank?"
2021-04-27 16:25,"I drank pretty heavily for about 4 years, but since late January of this year it’s gotten much less. MUCH less."
2021-04-27 16:31,"As another commenter inquired, why are hearing about this now?   My second shot was 13 March 2021.   It was a Saturday afternoon, and I celebrated having three Amstel Lights before dinner and one with dinner.  After following every single protocol and then some, it comes down to this?   Actually I'm kind of furious."
2021-04-27 16:35,"It seems to me that the main point of this article is the sub-text differentiating moderate from heavy drinking, which is useless because most, if not all, heavy drinkers (read: alcoholics) do not see themselves that way and are adept at splitting hairs over what constitutes heavy drinking. By any measure, it's not what they do. Beer? Well, that's 'just beer,' the Coke of alcoholics. Wine drinkers will 'finish the bottle' because otherwise they're wasting wine. And I could count on one hand the number of people I know who think a 5 ounce pour is a typical glass of wine or who drink champagne unless it's a celebratory occasion. However, the article makes clear that there are a lot of awkward conversations taking place in doctor's offices and tele-health meetings these days."
2021-04-27 17:08,"Coincidentally I stopped drinking a week or two after my first vaccine shot. Now I’m worried because of the overlap. Reading this article more closely, it isn’t clear how harmful heavy drinking is before or after the vaccine. It doesn’t advise when it’s okay to resume drinking after the vaccine. And it doesn’t say if the immune system recovers its immune response to the vaccine if you stop. There are no clear guidelines or recommendations, maybe because there are no definitive studies. Breaking news like this seems a little reckless. It kinda falls along the lines of articles that report the benefits of eating chocolate. It’s good to know the precautions, but I seriously wonder whether it makes sense to alarm thousands of readers based on scant evidence."
2021-04-27 15:22,"Not really interested in the alcohol question since I don't drink much.  

What I am curious about is the Covid booster shot.  When this booster shot comes out will I have to get it from the same company that I got my Covid shots from.  i.e. if I got two shots of Maderna do I have to get a Maderna booster?  Or can I go with a Johnson and Johnson or an Astra Zenica booster?"
2021-04-27 17:34,"I have always wondered why alcohol-level recommendations are based on gender not weight. It doesn't make sense that a140-pound male is ""allowed"" 2 drinks while a 220-pound woman is limited to a recommended 1 drink, even factoring in possible gender differences in metabolizing alcohol. It's known that different health conditions are also factors.  Any answers out there?"
2021-04-27 14:15,"I read this article as saying ""If you get drunk to celebrate on the weekend after your second shot you could be killing yourself!""  I find articles like this frustrating because they are mostly sourced in puritanism and scare tactics.  This is the equivalent of telling people they have to wear a mask indoors and can't ever go to a movie or get on a plane AFTER they are vaccinated.  Scare tactics only increase vaccine hesitancy, and when you get down to it the only actual science involved in this article is: alcohol dehydrates you so drink gatorade.  I just see people, some doctors and some columnists, who are willing to overstate a threat to achieve their own goal of scaring people into drinking less, either because of medical reasons or just because they disapprove.  And if there is a negative effect because of having four beers the Friday night after your second shot instead of two, is that enough to delay reaching the immunity threshold?  ""IT MIGHT"" is not good enough right now.  If there is a concern that, because of getting drunk, people who have had the second shot still are not at the immunity threshold (which has not to my knowledge been definitively established) then there should be free testing with reported antibody levels.  Risks should be taken seriously but too many of these ""do this don't do that"" articles are about putting people in the wrong so they can be scolded, and Americans do not have a positive reaction to overstating threats and scaremongering."
2021-04-27 13:17,"In this article you state, ""Some studies have even found that over the longer term, small or moderate amounts of alcohol might actually benefit the immune system by reducing inflammation.""

Last month you published an article linking the consumption of alcohol to several types of cancer, and stated, ""But while moderate drinking has long had a health halo, recent studies suggest it may not be beneficial at all. ""

Which is it?"
2021-04-27 13:42,"Funny thing about alcohol, is that the epidemiology of the drug has done nothing but get considerably worse over the last few decades.  

What constitutes ""moderate drinking"" has declined significantly.

One of the most dangerous aspects of alcohol that has to be thoroughly investigated is how the drug induces people to *sit* and avoid exercise.

In the background, the drug remains the catalyst of choice for assault, sexual assault, rape, homicide and heavy machinery mayhem.  

If you love the police, this is the best make-work drug out there for domestic security forces."
2021-04-27 16:49,"I don't drink alcoholic beverages often, but when I do, they are plant-based.

For the love of Pete, I'm pretty sure that most of us already knew that drinking too much liquor, beer and wine was bad for us. Did anyone ponder the danger of too much wine when they got their flu shots in years past? Didn't think so."
2021-04-27 16:54,"Hey NYT---maybe you could follow this up with some kind of specific guidance from an immunologist for those of us who did do some heavy drinking in the few days after getting a shot. Looking through the comment thread, this seems to have sparked a lot of anxiety. Folks who had been very cautious this past year are now feeling like their vaccination status is in jeopardy. There was no guidance at the time of vaccination about consuming alcohol. Now that this might be an issue, I'm sure many people would love to hear from an expert about whether they should still consider themselves to be fully vaccinated---or if there may be other steps they now need to take to achieve full vaccination status."
2021-04-27 16:05,Why weren't we told months ago it's best not to consume alcohol day before and after the shot? I sure know lots of people who did.
2021-04-27 16:46,"I see this as a non issue. Think of all of the people in the vaccine trials that drank. I doubt they were told not to, and the efficacy rates were enough to push the vaccines through for use to the general population."
2021-04-27 17:03,I’m in my 20s and don’t always live wisely. I came to this comment section expecting finger-wagging. God bless you fellow miscreants of any age.
2021-04-27 17:25,Are there any specific situations where health professionals condone heavy drinking?
2021-04-27 17:26,"If someone is a heavy drinker, people probably have been suggesting for years that he or she cut back. If the heavy drinker has resisted following that good advice over all of these years, he or she almost certainly will continue drinking to excess after the second coronavirus vaccination. The best you are going to see is a couple days of moderate alcohol consumption.

At some point, healthcare professionals have to accept that some people do not behave in their own best interests. Of course, physicians and nurse practitioners already know that reality.

Rather than worry about these self-inflicted wounds, we should be more concerned about a patient with limited intelligence and experience who is following the advice of some crackpot politician who claims that the risk of infection is being overstated by liberals."
2021-04-27 12:45,"Last Saturday night, after getting my 2nd vaxx shot in the morning, Googled to see if I could have a beer. The automatic suggestion after typing in ""Can I have a beer after"" was ""COVID vaccine"". The next was ""Ibuprofen"", but 3rd was ""colonoscopy"". I can see really needing a beer after that."
2021-04-27 16:08,"Really?

You know, heavy drinking is a bad idea, period, responsible for the early deaths of tens of thousands of Americans every year.

I don't need to learn that in the NYT.

We are witnessing the infantilization of America.  Americans are sad that they grew up.  They want someone, anyone, to tell them what to do and to keep them safe from everything."
2021-04-27 12:22,"This is a standard, terrible, pseudo scientific article. Its full of all the usual errors. First, lets talk ""standard drink"". I drink, usually very moderately, beer. Like (pre pandemic, less now because my favorite bars are closed) three a week. But ""standard"", hah! what a joke! They vary from 3.9 to 13% alcohol for a 12 (bottle or can) to 9 to 16  (tap) oz serving. That's a huge range. Also,
people vary ... why should it be the same for someone weighing 80 pounds and an NFL lineman weighing 275? It should be given in oz alcoloh per 100 pounds!

Then there are the monkeys. That study's description neglects to point out the fallacy: they don't explain which is cause and which is effect or is it a corellation? That is ... It is the alcohol causing the effect on the vaccine, or is the the effect on the vaccine caused by the same cause as the different desires for alcohol? I'm quite sure that the reason I drink only a little is that if I drink even twice as much a day I feel terrible rather than good. It's clearly some biological effect. 

And, of course, those very few people read this paper, its another reason not to get the vaccine. 

Thge piece is silly and counterproductive. 

What would be good is to say ""one week (yes, one) after the second dose of vaccine, you can stop wearing a mask anywhere you go, except the hospital covid ward, no matter what the other rules are."" THAT would get the lines for vaccine much longer fast."
2021-04-27 15:38,"Thank you Anahad O’Connor, for an excellent wake up reminder, that we have to be vigilant, if we like our alchohol too much. I am disappointed by the NYT commenting blogosphere today, as so many attack you for being down or causing stress. Hark, perhaps you have struck a nerve. It is not just in Russia, that many people drink regularly, and sometimes to excess. I have to monitor my own behavior, as Professor Moody desccribed fighting Voldemort, ""with constant vigilance.""  Two very alcoholic parents are clear indicators that I fall in that half of the US, and probably world population, that is very easily addicted to sugar based products, that include sweets, alcholic beverates, opiods and niccotine. There was an astonishly good book about this by a researcher, called ""The Hidden Addiction.""  All these dangerous but popular products have a commen source of molecules, belonging to the sugar family.
I'm so sorry that so  many here attack you for presenting life-protecting information, as if you were out to take away the punch bowl just as the party got cooking. However, more often than not, that is what responsible people, reading the science, should do more often, and I thank you for the clarity of your reporting.

2021-04-27 12:37,If you have a need for alcohol after getting vaxed you most likely have a problem.

2021-04-27 15:15,"So the upshot of the article is, everything in moderation."
2021-04-27 17:21,Now they tell us....
2021-04-27 15:59,This article could be written about doing anything.
2021-04-27 17:44,"Making monkeys drink heavily?  I get it . . . a great deal of medical research is predicated on animal-based experiments.  If not for that, we wouldn't have incredible advances in the care of horses, cats, and dogs.  But surely there is an alternative to getting thinking, feeling beings intoxicated.  Horses drink beer for health reasons, and they enjoy it . . . but no good trainer would allow a horse to get sloshed."
2021-04-27 17:53,"Fir of all, this article is about how alcohol use impacts immune response. Not how alcohol impacts your vaccine side affects. Two very different things.

As to heavy versus moderate drinking: as with blood pressure and cholesterol levels and many other health factors, the guidelines shift all the time. Data tells you about a population (the universe of the study) a whole and what, generally, works.

But it doesn't speak to where you're at, as an individual; it's just a guide.

Me: Fit. Lean. Work out, hard, six days a week. Never miss a day. Walk and bike much more than use a car. Walk or bike at least 2 and usually 5, 8, 10 miles a day. Positive mindset. Large circle of friends. Great marriage of 26 years and a great family. Great job. Several challenging, flow-inducing hobbies like playing music, painting and reading literature. I watch zero TV. After work, I avoid computer and phone screens. I eat sensibly. Less fat. Less salt. Less meat. More vegetables. This all has taken a ton of discipline (I miss ice cream!) but age 60, people guess me to be in my late 40s. I drink more than a moderate drinker; three glasses of wine every evening, plus a martini on Friday night and an Old Fashioned on Saturday night. I take no prescription drugs and seldom use OTC drugs. I expect to live a long time. And if I don't...who cares...I have had a helluva lot of fun."
2021-04-27 17:58,"My husband and I usually have a glass of wine with dinner. We got our first vaccination a week ago. Neither of us felt OK enough to want alcohol for several days, and we'll play it by ear after the second shot."
2021-04-27 18:36,"I don't drink and I had a reactions to both Pfizer shots. The lst shot caused a lymph node to (painfully) swell on my collarbone. 

My recent 2nd shot caused a painful arm, strong  chills, fever, body aches, brain fog, fatigue (which I still have) and I lost my apatite. I also couldn't stand the smell of certain foods. 

For those that are daily alcohol drinkers, it would have been helpful to mention this issue but it many have not been published because of so many who refuse to get vaccinated. 

Some may have used 'no alcohol' as an excuse to not get the vaccinations. Some are looking for any excuse to avoid these vaccinations."
2021-04-27 18:50,"Given that more than 40 percent of Americans live in a state where adult-use/recreational and medical marijuana is legal, it seems an omission to not include cannabis in this discussion, whether smoked, vaped, consumed as food or beverage, or applied topically."
2021-04-27 18:50,And any advice if generally active and healthy people celebrated the vaccine a bit too much?  Should we add a few more weeks until we can assume our immune systems have caught up with our foolhardy behavior?
2021-04-27 20:01,Reading this makes me wonder if there are any effects with marijuana and the vaccine. I’ve been partaking regularly through the pandemic and even after taking my j&j shot several weeks ago. I asked the folks giving me the shot if it’d be alright and my doctor doesn’t mind either but I am curious

2021-04-27 21:07,"I find articles like this unnecessary and likely to cause anxiety, because as of now there is *zero* evidence alcohol consumption inhibits the effectiveness of MRNA vaccines. No doctor is going to give a green light to drink heavily, so use common sense around the time of vaccination."
2021-04-27 21:23,Did they track alcohol consumption during the clinical trials for the vaccines?  That would seem to be a good starting place to look into the issue.
2021-04-27 21:39,"On the other hand, moderate drinking (but with strong alcohol like Whisky for example) is enough to neutralize the virus if he's just installed in your breathing system.

Alcohol doesn't work only on your hands, it work inside you, heavy drinkers are immune to the flu, this is something notorious. A moderate drinking can protect you. Of course it doesn't replace the more efficient vaccine, but it work too."
2021-04-27 22:09,"Lots of griping amongst the comments.  I, for one, found this interesting, and even a bit fun. Interesting because of the associations of moderate drinking with some salutary health effects like lower inflammatory markers.  Fun because I won't worry about having my daily beer tomorrow after dose number 2 from Moderna.  I might have wondered about appropriateness otherwise."
2021-04-27 22:18,"Even though the United States has its share of what would technically be considered heavy drinkers, our scientists and doctors did not assess alcohol consumption as a variable in their clinical trials for the vaccines.  Yet it is widely known around the globe that alcohol consumption can significantly weaken the immune system response, depending on how much is consumed.  Still, no official warnings issued from the CDC since the trials did not include this factor while assessing the efficacy of the vaccines. 
That, in it of itself, is very disturbing but then for the CDC and FDA to stay silent on the issue while millions upon millions are vaccinated without a word of caution?"
2021-04-27 22:22,"""Can you have alcohol after the covid vaccine?""

Not sure - but you definitely can after the flu vaccine. Time will tell if the covid vaccine offers the same benefit. Many of us are already taking part in the trials."
2021-04-27 22:40,"Heh. One of the few things we've been able to do during pandemic lockdowns is drink. Getting vaccinated isn't going to stop anybody from drinking, and may get us all back into the bars."
2021-04-27 23:08,"There have been quite a few cases that heavy drinkers are killed by Covid-19. So, heavy drinking is a sort of preexisting condition and can be subject to prioritizing vaccination. Unfortunately, they cannot stop drinking even during vaccination."

2021-04-27 22:30,Fascinating. So so many of the comments are from people fretting that they hate the messenger.
2021-04-27 23:31,"Since relatively little is known about covid, the vaccines, and how alcohol interacts with them both, perhaps the most prudent approach is to simply refrain from drinking around the time of your vaccination. If you aren't capable of that (or of keeping it to one or two drinks/day), you just might have a drinking problem (and more significant issues to deal with)."

2021-04-27 21:08,Of course you  CAN have alcohol after or before getting an inoculation or driving a chartered bus for kindergarten children.  The issue is whether it is responsible to do so.

This comes less than a week after an article in the Times Magazine - dated April 21, 2021 - with the headline -- ""How Bad Is Our Pandemic Drinking Problem?""

Over the past year - not a month has gone by without an alcohol-related article centered around the issues related to the pandemic and the lockown --

A few well-known bits of wisdom --

Drinking alone on a regular basis is bad for you -

Drinking to soothe or alleviate your anxiety and depression is bad for you -

Mixing alcohol with prescription drugs is bad for you - and if you're not sure - it's better to err on the side of caution -

Worrying that you may run out of alcohol before worrying that you may run out of basic food staples is a bad sign -

Telling yourself your fit, trim and healthy - so you're in complete control of your drinking is a bad sign -

Lots of people enjoy drinking - and that's great - but the Times should really stop with this now - okay ? ..."

There are more like 6 drinks, or close, per 25.4oz bottle with the vast majority of wines. Just one editorial qualification. 
It is as though reporters, and also many healthcare 'experts', don't drink and/or are gladly casual about large-percentage math shifts."

This whole pandemic has been one ""expert"" mistake/misunderstanding after another starting with not having the correct PPE  for medical professionals right from the get-go and I do not mean N-95 masks. A quick search on OSHA for SARS Viruses would have brought you to the page telling you N-95 is ONLY acceptable when none of the above is available. How many medical people got sick and/or died because of this mistake. 

I don't recall seeing anything saying alcohol had a long shot at impairing the vaccine. I don't drink, but many people were looking to get every point of protection possible. Even if it were just a whim of fancy from a prohibitionist it would not have hurt to say ""to maximize the immune response don't drink X long before the 1st shot or until your 43rd day."

Some people who drink a lot also smoke, are couch potatoes, eat junk food, may even hang out in unprotected places (inside bars) - all of which can exacerbate co-morbidities, long term inflammation, poor sleep, thus decreasing effectiveness of natural antibodies to fight infections. Others who imbibe also lead healthy lives relatively otherwise.

Huh. For decades now almost no wine has been 12%. See how many you can in the aisles of  Total. 

It is as if researchers and doctors and HC journalists do not drink or do not pay attention if they do. 

The standard wine portion definition should be closer to 4oz of wine. 

Pour 4.5oz of normal modern wine into your, or your guest's, nice glass, and see how it looks and how satisfactory it is.

I'm fully vaccinated. amd I would miss meeting friends and family at indoor restaurants, going to the ball game outdoors, etc. - my newfound freedom!  And imposing greater restrictions hurts businesses.

Now that everyone 16 and over is eligible for a vaccine, I favor vaccine passports that private enterprises can use to determine who may enter, fly, etc.  If people choose not to get vaccinated, they may not be allowed to do some things.

That feels to me like a win-win-win.  I can eat gather with my friends and family, businesses won't go backwards, and more people will have an incentive to get vaccinated.

2021-04-25 18:42,"Well the Michigan legislature filled with right-wing Republicans passed a law limiting the power of the governor to shut down businesses which would help suppress the spread of Covid -- because, you know -- ""free-dumb"" -- so now medical personnel are again being stretched to the limit and younger people are becoming ill and as a result this mess is prolonging the pandemic.

2021-04-25 18:58,"There's some math that needs to be done in this article about the relative shift from older to younger people. The entire first year of the pandemic was mostly about older people getting sick in large numbers.  This sounds really cruel, but this was effectively a huge ""culling"" of those most susceptible. The older people that remain have some kind of stronger resistance, and then add their vaccination priority on top of that. So as a matter of math, it makes sense that more cases, including serious ones, are now younger - it almost couldn't have been any other way. That does NOT indicate a change in younger-people behavior, or a variant that attacks younger people more. It's just basic statistics."

A Public Service announcement was given to please come to the Pharmacy for a Vaccine)!  This appears to me that getting one's first jab is pretty darn available!
However, sadly I think this is more about pro-Trump politics, along with the attitude that this will not happen to me.  
I am sick of hearing that people have Covid Fatigue.  I think that people need to grow up!  Life is one challenge after another.  Whether one has financial stability or not, there will be challenges.  You need to make concessions in life in order to live life.  Period!  
Not getting vaccinated is a selfish act of ignorance!  It does not hurt!  Personally, I did not want to wait until an appointment came available in my area for my age cohort and medical conditions; under 65 yo with no underlying health conditions.  I heard about a site in the City of Detroit at a church from a cousin.  I took two afternoons off from my business and drove 190 miles round trip not once but twice and made sure that I not only was vaccinated, but was jabbed 2-3 weeks before it was available in my area.  I knew that the UK variant was coming to Michigan.  I took action.

What happened? 
Why are we now the hottest hot spot in the world?
It's not a mystery, though the GOP will certainly attempt to construct a scapegoat.
Michigan's Republican legislators filed multiple lawsuits in conservative courts that stripped Gov. Gretchen Whitmer of the executive power she was using to project us. Meanwhile Faux News and social media drove the base into a fear-fueled, mindless frenzy. 
This spike as we appeared to see sunlight after our long, tragic night is heartbreaking.
It is time for the Republican leaders in this state to stop lying to our people. Too many of our citizens have died who did not have to, and now the death is coming for our children and young people. 
It's too late for the families already mourning, but lives can still be saved. Unfortunately, our safest path would require Republican leaders to dig deep and reclaim the values the party has historically held.  
Michigan is suffering as a direct result of bad decisions made by our leaders. Those same leaders could save lives by admitting that truth. Doing that would take courage and humility, and both traits seem to be extinct in today's GOP. 
For a party that claims to value strength and truth, I am perplexed why Republicans elect so many dishonest cowards."

And thirty or forty somethings with children eating at bars and restaurants in crowded conditions and flying off on vacations. I have a difficult time understanding and having sympathy for those who are so self indulgent and such weak of character that they will place themselves at such high risk for a burger and a beer. As the one nurse observed ""it’s just like, you know, we can’t save them all”, nor should we try. We need to save medical care for those who are more responsible. We need to preserve, support and strengthen our medical caregivers."
2021-04-25 20:06,"The notion that the youth were gonna be, and remain basically ""immune"" was always a specious claim.

When I got sick, and recovered last year, and the younger folks I work with were adamant that they shouldn't have to wear masks, I shook my head, disgusted in their ignorance of what was going on, and castigated them not to be certain of their immunity. ""It aint gonna stay this way, the virus will change, it will seek new victims and you kids are next!""

Lo and behold, my aged wisdom and odd-ball knowledge of these things are proving true. 

The one aspect of Evolution far too many, especially those who don't know or don't want to know what Evolution is and how it works, is that it aint about us! Its always about the microbes. Its always about microscopic life...we're just the carriers and end results of all those bazillions of organisms across the planet in all their niches, working in their secretive worlds to change things.

2021-04-25 20:16,"Before out-of-staters judge the good people of Michigan—because we all know how people love to judge—know that in most metropolitan areas here in Michigan people are masking up and social distancing. Sadly, we’ve not done a good job as a state in terms of vaccine accessibility. I’ve helped several family members get vaccine appointments and it’s taken a considerable amount of effort; people still can’t easily get one at any one of the brand name pharmacies within 45 miles of Ann Arbor without tons of time invested trying to weed through an imperfect system. 

Meanwhile, I’ve talked to family and friends in California, and even though access started later there for the general population, at least anecdotally, they seem to be getting in to appointments easier than we are. If you live here it’s clear to understand why Governor Whitmer was pushing for more vaccine. 

We are starting to see more availability in recent days, but sadly, it’s a little too late for those who are now in the hospitals fighting for their lives. ￼￼I think the biggest lesson we’ll learn from this pandemic is how people with less technical know-how or even access to online appointment systems are also the most vulnerable. 

That said, I hear there are places in our state where people aren’t masking up, but they’re more rural and less populated areas￼. It’s no coincidence that these areas are also showing high rates of Covid per capita."

What we have seen in Michigan is probably a micro-climate combining bad weather, pollution, poverty and new variant.

The virus is trying to survive and is searching for the best possible condition to spread, but time is running out for him, vaccination and good weather are coming fast now.

The English variant can be controled, it's unlikely that this virus could spread more in many others states. It sound like a last stand for the Covid"

I suspect that they are pressuring local health departments to downplay precautions. If Covid was a sexually transmitted disease we would all be under house arrest double secret lockdown.

2021-04-25 21:13,"Two female family members of mine, in the 50–55 age group, living hundreds of miles away in communities where attitudes toward mask wearing, social distancing and COVID vaccinations range from ambivalent to hostile, fell ill with novel coronavirus within the past six months. One was able to recuperate at home; the other has comorbidities and was hospitalized, along with a senior family member. Thankfully, the three of them have fully recovered.

The elderly father of the younger family member also fell ill at the same time as she, and within days was admitted to an area hospital, where he required around-the-clock oxygen support. His symptoms deteriorated within days; he was transferred to the Intensive Care dept. and spent the next two to three weeks on that floor, fighting to survive.

His condition improved enough to allow him to be moved to a long-term care facility. Within two days, he was discovered in bed in a cyanotic condition, with his oxygen apparatus hanging off his head. He has remained there, receiving rehabilitative services, with varying mixes of oxygen continuously supplied, however, something is missing.

In my opinion, I have been unable to conduct a normal conversation with him since then. He repeats certain phrases, seemingly without remembering what he previously said. We are told talking takes a lot out of him, although his voice is growing stronger. I don’t think he just happened to get senile, nor am I calling him that. He and our family were robbed."
2021-04-25 21:15,"A friend of mine told me yesterday about a conversation she had with a friend who lives in suburban Detroit. Her friend told her about a recent school trip for high school students (this is a public school). Vaccinations were not required to go on the trip, and each student had to have a least one parent attend as well. Well, who would believe it, but lots of students and parents tested positive after returning. I don’t understand why any school would organize any trip, especially one out-of-state, during a pandemic. Maybe this kind of behavior is contributing to Covid-19 among young people in Michigan."
2021-04-25 21:17,"I wish that priority for vaccines had been thought out better.  Retired people (like me) can easily isolate.  We do not have to go to work, and supermarkets can deliver.  Our normal contacts are few.  We could have waited.
On the other hand, there are people,  like those in meat packing plants and similar situations who breathe the same air as their dozens of co-workers for hours every day; a check out clerk at the supermarket may come into contact with over a hundred customers, although the contacts are quite brief.  A hundred contacts with even a small percentage of risk for each one ultimately adds up.
Some algorithm involving both numbers of contacts and duration should have been used to determine priorities.  
However, all of this is in the past.  The challenge now is to encourage people to save their own lives and the lives of those around them by accepting vaccination."

I bet that these same people complain about paying taxes. We shouldn't use our tax dollars to reward them for doing their civic duty. Instead, they should be fined and/or be put in ""COVID jails"".

The simple mathematical result? Hospitalizations have gone up, but the average age of those hospitalized has gone down. 

It's simple math folks and has zero to do with variants, loosening of restrictions or anything else the doctors say to try and make themselves look smart.

And yes, NO doctor ever says they admit to hospitals based on availability of beds, except that's contradicted by every systematic study that's been done of medicine.  Have bed? Will fill."

2021-04-25 22:17,"Very concerning. However, I would love some data on the change in covid admission to hospitals in Michigan. The author cites twice the number of admissions to one hospital of younger folks - but what are the numbers. The rate could have doubled but still be quite small or not. What about to other hospitals throughout Michigan. One doctor’s claim that he is putting more young people on oxygen is also concerning - but none of this information gives a real understanding of the situation in Michigan and what if anything can be extrapolated to other states."

Please explain this to the governor of Florida.

Is it a violation of your ""freedom"" for a business to require a visitor to wear a hard hat before entering its factory?

2021-04-25 22:40,"I live across what used to be a hole-in-the-wall sized bar in Greenwich Village. When NYC encouraged restaurants to move their dining outdoors last year, our local hangout, which is frequented only by gen Zs and younger millennials, did so as well. Evidently, serving bar fare now qualifies a bar to call itself a restaurant.

Since last year this bar has increased its size three-fold by constructing shanty-like structures along its perimeter and on the roadway outside it. Most nights you can find its raucous and unmasked patrons standing by islands shoulder-to-shoulder guzzling down beers in full view of the public. 

It's a nauseating display of ignorance, arrogance and self-indulgence. When I consider our local hospital workers and how long and hard they've toiled to save lives since last year, sometimes at the expense of their own, I become enraged. If this is the best our society has to offer, heaven help us."

There are still a lot of anti-vaxxers who won't wear a mask or social distance. Seems they're now getting sick."

2021-04-25 22:47,"What is the level of obesity in these “young” people? There is numerical age and physical age. Some 30-40 year-olds could have the body and health of a much older person.

And, have these “young” people been following sensible protocols of masks and social distancing, or just “freedumb”?"
2021-04-25 22:49,"What I find perplexing is the idea that Michigan is somehow unique in its worsening Covid hospitalizations.  It just
doesn't make sense that Michigan is alone with such increasing hospitalizations.

We've all seen photos of young people going maskless in different states.  Florida, for instance, showed young people going maskless during spring break.  I'm sure many other states influenced by their state lawmakers usually Republicans under the sway of Trump thinking did not request any safety precautions to prevent the virus.

So what makes Michigan unique in its high toll of young victims?  Could it be because these other states haven't released their data or perhaps there is a larger percentage of the British variant of Covid or perhaps we're going to get a nasty surprise when updated data from 
other states is revealed?  The virus will always win unless we outsmart it."
2021-04-25 22:50,"I don't understand why a political party would decide to ally itself with a virus, undermining efforts to contain it and endangering the party's own members. Especially in a state suffering as Michigan is, I'd have expected Republicans to be vying with Democrats to see which side can do the best job of containing COVID-19 and getting everyone vaccinated.

I don't see the political upside of attacking the very idea of promoting maximum vaccination, as Republican Sen Ron Johnson  (of Michigan's across-the-lake neighbor Wisconsin) just did."

Now that we’ve watched variant after variant arise abroad and here we should not accept the reticence of vaccine avoiders who endanger us all.  A new patient number one, someone who harbors a vaccine resistant variant strain, may be: the neighbor down the street afraid of needles, the anti-vaxer who home schools her child (who isn’t permitted to attend  the local school but plays in the playground with other kids), or the partisan extremest who believes government action, science and perceived enemies “on the other side” are “out to get him.”  These folks are pariahs, who if they refuse to be educated to do the right thing, should be locked-down in isolation for their own protection and for that of the rest of us!"
2021-04-25 23:14,"One reason this virus is so successful is that it mutates more quickly than any virus since HIV. As I understand it, this trait makes it impossible to achieve herd immunity without vaccinations. More successful and contagious variants like the B.1.1.7 will quickly become dominant, and these in turn will spawn even more successful variants.

This is a wily opponent fighting for its own survival. I wonder if we humans, with all our emotional foibles, are up to the task of taming it."

I don’t care if you’re solid blue, like us, or solid red like SC. The virus doesn’t care and will find you. The arrogance of humans always amazes me."

Many Americans are ridiculous and lack the ability to think critically."
2021-04-25 23:22,"Unfortunately, the SNL bit entitled, .""Boomers got the vax"" rings true.

Now that the boomers have been or can get vaccine, they are tearing off the masks and reopening everything.  It may be their children and grandchildren taking the hit but do not underestimate the selfishness and greed of the worst generation.  This is their classic move, climb the ladder and pull it up behind them.

I was at a church gathering this weekend.  Those without masks or wearing them on their chin were all boomers.  These are the people who we now realize did not protest Vietnam because they thought it was an unjust war, they simply felt too entitled to serve or sacrifice for their country or anyone else.  Same holds true today."

It pains me to say( and be in the presence of), but we have a  bunch of hypocritical  knuckleheads as citizenry who love science when it come to their cars, knee replacements, cell phones, weapons, you name it,  but play lemmings and ostrich when they shut off their thinking skills and barnacle themselves to the rusty hulls of so-called ""leaders"". mostly ""the former guy"" and currently his sycophants.

2021-04-26 0:19,"“After hosting a small lunch in his backyard late last month, when vaccines were not yet open to everyone in Michigan, several family members tested positive for the virus.”  It’s tragic that people became ill, but this sounds like the writer is blaming the lack of vaccine availability for illness transmission rather than personal choice to take a large risk by socializing with people outside one’s own household.  Even guests who are relatives or close friends may not be following strict protocols (wearing masks outside their homes, washing hands, limiting social activities) and inviting them to a group lunch is high risk."

And yep. That'd be Trump country. Big time. So the social distancing thing--not as much of a factor there. 

They're sending their patients to Detroit area hospitals like Beaumont because, as a rural area, they don't have a lot of ICU capacity. 

So the rural, 'tired of experts' crowd is now in dire need of the experts who are based in the urban areas that manyof those rural folks have sneered at in the past."
2021-04-26 0:42,"Hearing from family in Michigan, below is my list in regards to causes behind the Michigan surge:
—the UK variant has been spreading in the state since early January
—availability of vaccine was tight until 3-4 weeks ago
—individuals are tired of social distancing but the weather has not yet allowed for outdoor gatherings often
—the state allows for easy testing and actually accurately reports case and hospitalization data
—the governor is too nervous to enact restrictions due to threats to her life"

We could have been done with this if people had gotten serious earlier. We got a reprieve because of the diligence and skill of scientists, however, we won't defeat this current virus until people get serious about the fight. At this rate, Covid19 will be with us for years and not ""like the flu."" Furthermore, given Climate Change, Covid20 is just around the corner."

I have high school students still struggling to breathe months after having covid-19. Months. And these are fit athletes, some of whom told me they were encouraged to play, despite misgivings, by coaches and parents. Nice work people. We couldn't wait one year out?

The parents in Hudsonville who want the school to lift the mask requirement for students, they didn't, are the spreaders. Personally I see folks with out masks I bawl them out.

Of course the irony is that a huge and way disproportionate percentage of the MDs and Ph.D.s on the front-lines of American hospitals and research labs are 1st, 2nd or 3rd generation immigrants of color."

And, a gaggle of women were talking with their noses UNcovered by their masks. The local *Fire Chief* delivered smoke alarms to my cottage WITHOUT wearing a mask (no, he was not allowed inside!). Yes, they all were in the 30-50 age group. These three scenarios all are examples of why we will never beat COVID. This age group is so self-absorbed that they are incapable of making the smallest contribution to benefit the greater good. I am both angry and ashamed of them! Following the protocols means nothing to them. I am fully vaccinated, stay home except for necessary trips (e.g. to pick up groceries curbsude), wear a mask, carry hand sanitizer, disposable gloves, and disinfecting wipes in my car/purse. If EVERYONE would take these simple steps seriously and follow them CONSISTENTLY and CONTINUOUSLY we could eradicate this virus."

Those who are getting sick and transmitting COVID to others in Michigan are: the 10 to 19 year olds; and, the greatest super spreaders are...20 to 29 year olds. Now, why is that? 

For the 10 to 19? high school age sports both organized and extemporaneous programs...basket ball, girls and mostly young men. And for the 20 to 29 year olds? College kids and lots of people disregarding not only their own safety but that of others as well: namely, the cluelessly self-absorbed. 

The same behavior was seen during the early stages of the pandemic Spring 2020 when young people gathered in convenient store parking lots including flash organized music festivals. Now the music/dancing/partying/drinking/drugs are in indoor ""bootlegged"" locations. 

Reason and eduction won't reach this crowd.

Let’s not get an idea this is limited to Michiganders after we’ve seen the unpredictable virus hitting one region, and then another a few months later, ever since it started. I think vaccines will greatly reduce deaths, and they’re effective against B.1.1.7.

But Covid is likely here to stay. Additional variants such as B.1.351 are also around, for which reason it appears the Johnson & Johnson shot demonstrated lower efficacy in South African trial participants late last year. Definitely keep an eye on things, and get vaccinated. I feel much less worry now that I’ve had the shots, so using a mask at the store now is more a routine to be careful as recommended than an act of fear."

It's people like that who are extending this pandemic into all of our futures and endangering everyone. If you have lost a loved one to a communicable disease like Covid, as I have, you never take precautions for granted, and you take precautions to save not only yourself, but those you love, and those you love because they are human.

One correlation that holds pretty much everywhere is that counties that went largely for Trump in 2020 also have a strong correlation to high positive test results. Correlation does not prove causation. Nor does it suggest a lack of education. Plenty of Trump voters here are well-off and/or highly educated. Rather, it appears to be a matter of strong political conviction."
2021-04-26 4:06,"Michigan exemplifies the reality of how readily this virus spreads among an unvaccinated population.  The idea that infections will go down as more individuals become vaccinated holds true for the entire population as whole. But it is not true for subgroups of the population that remain largely unvaccinated. People do not randomly associate witn other people. We know from the analysis of social networks that individuals tend to associate most with other individuals of the same same race, education, age, and politics.  Among some subgroups of the population, such as people of color and white Republicans, there is significant rejection of the vaccine. While vaccinated people tend ot associate with other vaccinated people, unvaccinated people tend to associate with other unvaccinated people. For individuals in these subgroups skeptical of the vaccine, every social gathering tends to be largely with individuals who, like themselves, have not been vaccinated.  Thus for these subgroups, the risk of COVID infection from ill advised behaviors is nearly as high now as any other time during the pandemic, including during the first nine months when there was no vaccine at all."
2021-04-26 5:50,"It's been apparent in news from the start that young people can get seriously ill with COVID; I believe this was downplayed and dangerously so.

Also, I have noticed that there is a surplus of vaccines in New Jersey. It seems as though the 20 - 29 year olds aren't rushing to get vaccinated. This is a mistake as many of these younger people are now going out to restaurants and congregating together."

But across the board and all through the pandemic, journalists have chosen to feature patients who are younger, slimmer, blacker and more female than would have been the case if they'd chosen randomly. 

It also feels as if this trend has been reported before only for the hard boring figures to end up showing that the majority of victims were still - statistically - old, fat men. (With the possible exception of heavily pregnant women for whom the baby makes breathing more difficult.)

It stands to reason that vaccinating the old could make the trend real but still people might not be convinced."

Both comparisons would graphically show how large of an issue--and quandary this is.  The next question is why--and I got more from reader speculations than investigative journalism.  Last, ss always, deaths are more of a reliable stat, then tests, assuming honest reporting.  In general the reporting by the states has been honest, yet we can't assume that thanks to NY, Kentucky and other places that have either covered up or just been dysfunctional-especially at nursing homes and prisons."

First, the mutations and variants have spiked, and second there are a significant amount of people who don't take the virus seriously and don't take basic precautions. My wife and I have been serious about social distancing and mask wearing and such for a year until she came down with Covid. She works outside the home and I have been mostly working remotely. In her work, she teaches and practices massage therapy, she takes even more precautions, however, her class went out to lunch together one school day and of course they sat together and ate without masks. Six of the nine got infected. I had one dose of Moderna when she came down with it. I ended up testing positive but having no symptoms. She has now recovered and will be getting vaccinated next month. Even with good precautions this virus can find you. That's not to say precautions shouldn't be taken. I'm fully vaccinated and wear masks and social distance in public always. With a novel virus, the scientists do their best, but discovery is ongoing. Stay vigilant and get vaccinated."

He scheduled an appointment for a shot.   He got symptoms then tested positive, just days before his first shot.  He thought he had a fairly mild case I think, he was miserable, but at home, no mention of hospitals.  I talked to him on a Friday, he was sick of being sick but in his usual good spirits.  Two days later he was gone, passed in the night.   He was literally one of the very last people I thought this thing would get as he was so full of life and vigor.

On the one hand, it is encouraging that the vaccines appear to be working on the older populations, whose infection rates are down. On the other hand, due to the competition for getting shots, younger age groups are now more vulnerable to being infected.

We must increase our vigilance and expand our preventive measures while we work our way towards herd immunity."
2021-04-26 17:23,"Simply enraging.  Take a look at the Covind Map.  Rural sparsely populated counties just north of Macomb county as dark purple as the scale allows.

Macomb county has as many believers in science as not.  So they are getting it too. The fact that the family had to have an outdoor picnic is preposterous.  It has been a year, and even then most do not even comply with simply mask-wearing and social distancing.

There are now vaccines available EVERYWHERE here.  Many on a walk-in basis.  Trumpists are not swayed.  They refuse to understand or care about herd immunity or much of anything else other than doing whatever they want to do.  They are refusing vaccines here.

It is hard to see how we get to her immunity.  I think we will be wearing masks for years.   After Michigan, it will eventually be other states in turn.  Just wait.  

“It’s kind of rocked my view. I can’t believe Cara. Why is it her?”
This has to be one of the most startling quotes in the article.

Why?  Because she got near infected people with Covid.  Because she chose to.  Because her brother had to have a party.   Because Covis will infect anyone, anytime it can.

Go ahead, call me a ""hater""  and the Governor a dictator and a witch."

Dining-in and bars, in particular, are non-essential (along with unmasked political rallies, thankfully down since November).

Criminal charges should also be sought for those same people spreading and infecting others who subsequently died. Manslaughter."

Not to be disrespectful but Inquiring minds want to know: When the 37-year-old mother contracted Covid while pregnant, had she been wearing a mask regularly? 
Were people at that backyard bbq wearing masks?

Trying to figure out if masks work or if these people got Covid despite diligent mask wearing and hand washing.

Michigan decided to open schools and have school sports by 3/1. Surprise! 3 weeks later, they have a massive outbreak.

Nationwide, the age groups with the highest percentage of positive PCR tests are 12-17, 6-11, and 0-5.

Schools are driving community infection rates, not the other way around. Hopefully, when school lets out for the summer, we will see a big drop in cases. But summer sports and wishful thinking may keep things going."

2021-04-29 12:01,"I don't remember this happening with the flu. The anti-vaxxers love to cite ""99.7%"" survival rate, and are always more concerned with the unsubstantiated risks of a vaccine than the very real long-term risks of COVID."
2021-04-29 12:02,"Maybe we need to recognize that a lung transplant is an extraordinary intervention, and extraordinary interventions are not a solution.

No, I would never deny a transplant to a patient who has the ability to survive one, and an organ available that matches well enough to make survival likely.

But I would not set up the expectation that the transplant is possible or likely either. Families and patients need to know what they can do in the absence of the Hail Mary pass. 

I pray for people who are suffering, and I pray for genius or inspiration from our medical practitioners to find a way to heal these people, who bore the brunt of suffering through this. I haven't lost sight of the fact that only luck kept me from being part of the group; only luck spared my loved ones.

But issues of ethical fairness over a treatment that is limited by the patient's own health and survival capability, and limited by available organs, where demand outstrips resources, become moot. When a treatment cannot be available to all, there is no fair distribution."
2021-04-29 12:11,"I also wonder how many are turning down lung transplants not only because of difficulties and complications but because in this country, unless you are very rich, the cost would be so prohibitive that it is better and cheaper simply to die.

2021-04-29 12:18,"I spent several months getting to know some men at a recovery facility who had had lung transplants. They each developed diabetes immediately - a common ""side effect"" of lung transplants. The Diabetes then led to foot amputations. These men, now in wheelchairs, were terrified of the cascading consequences of the initial lung transplant.  They were not in good shape and depended on their wives for everything.  And these men had been in recovery for a while and were sad at the direction their lives had taken.
In all the early covid clamor for ventilators I often thought of these men and wondered what their opinion would be."
2021-04-29 12:19,"I am a seventy one year old male.  (Norm, not Susan.)  

I weigh rather too much--but am otherwise in reasonably good health.  My wife and I have both had our two vaccinations.  

But we talked about covid19 before we'd had even our first vaccination.  

I told her, ""I do NOT want to be intubated""--horrible sounding word!  I'd never heard of it before the pandemic hit.  And I got some vigorous pushback.  

""Do think it'd be easy for your children?"" she remonstrated.  ""To sit by and watch their Dad slowly SUFFOCATE.""  

Right now, Ms. Lamas--it's a moot point.  Neither of us is likely (thank You, Lord) to come down with covid19.  

But we'd both heard horror stories of permanently damaged lungs.  People now incapable of breathing on their own.  People who--having lived active and strenuous lives--are now bedridden.  Or can do little more than hobble from a bed to an easy chair.  Where they sit--gasping, puffing, getting their wind back.  

Tell you what, though!

My hat is OFF--permanently OFF! to you doctors and health care personnel who (as best you can) labor to preserve the lives of all of us.  You were heroes a year ago--when covid19 was devastating the United States.  

You still ARE heroes.  

Thank you.  God bless you all!"
2021-04-29 12:33,"My husband and I, despite being fully vaccinated, are still being very careful with masking and exposure to large groups, as we continue to have the feeling that the virus is far from done with us i.e. decreasing immunity with time and new variants. The idea of getting some form of “long-COVID,” with its long term diminishing of quality of life repercussions has always scared us ( and our friends) more than the disease itself. We will continue to prioritize the “ounce of prevention...” philosophy and wait as long as it takes    to return to whatever the “new normal” turns out to be."

2021-04-29 12:47,"Perhaps I'd feel differently if this actually happened to me, but I wouldn't choose to get a lung transplant under these circumstances. A major operation that would require a year of recovery and would put the lives of three of my relatives on hold? All for a terrible quality of life and to die broke 6 years later anyway? 

There needs to be more states that support a compassionate end to life if medicine cannot yet provide a worthwhile recovery plan."
2021-04-29 12:55,This article is as much about modern medicne as it is about the raverages of Covid! It clearly states what modrern technology can and cannot do and if some patients who survived may have been better off if they didn't. Americans need to have these discussion as a society not in the middle of a crisis. It should be a realistazion that even with the most expensive healthcare delivery system not all that is gold glistens.
2021-04-29 13:07,"There is no social distancing once you go into the public. People may be wearing masks but likely as not, they are wearing them improperly--not covering their nose. This is like not wearing masks at all. If you go to a store, bus, restaurant, office, there is no such thing as six feet apart. Why are people like politicians elbow-bumping or fist-bumping when they should be six feet apart? In a store people are going out, coming in, standing in line at a cash register--nowhere is there social distancing. Now, politicians are declaring: ""If you're vaccinated, there is no more need for precautions."" How will we know who is vaccinated and who isn't. What about the rules to stay masked in public? 

I went to a local office to get something notarized. The notary put on a mask while he handed me papers, etc. But immediately removed it as I sat there after, finishing the task, three feet from me. His co-worker, three feet from me, had no mask on. They both chatted with me and each other for five minutes. The receptionist had a mask dangling from her face as I thanked her as I left. My dentist and her husband-colleague stood three feet from me for five minutes at the receptionist's desk as I paid my bill --without masks. 

Watch out! We are not over this yet."
2021-04-29 13:07,"Expectorants can help (the kind that does not raise blood pressure).   While working in a hospital I had often wondered why doctors don't suggest them for people with lung disorders.  Even if it seems one does not have a lot of mucus, one does.   And it  makes breathing more difficult.  I discovered this with my reactive airway disease (asthma) and it has made a huge difference.  None of my doctors suggested it."
2021-04-29 13:08,"This little side news is actually Public health policy's most difficult aspect too.

Now we have vaccines and Covid will inevitably decline but like flu, it will never vanish. It will linger in our world who knows how long.  

So even you vaccinated or years later you contacted, you may get this rare complication.  

As an  MD, My gut feeling is  Coivd is a slightly more complicated disease than Flu. 

Nobody lived flu pandemic in 1918 lives anymore,  so nobody has any memory of how flu faded and become a  casual disease.

Covid will become too. But so far  It is scarier.

Will the business even survive anyway if he does?  And he got ill just two months ago when most in our community thought it was “over.”"
2021-04-29 13:15,"This is an interesting article but has not stressed, the most crucial element, the quality of life.  It appears that this extremely fragile, critically ill patient has no real possibility for a quality of life.   This something the physicians, and family needs to discuss.  In truth, they also need to discuss a DNR."
2021-04-29 13:15,"@ARC - I agree, except that I would say that NO states currently support a compassionate end to life to the extent that they need to. Even if someone CAN live for several more years, if the quality of life is not good enough for that patient they should be allowed to, and given the means to, end their own lives. 

This should include people for whom the only ""condition"" they are suffering from is old age. I've known many elderly folks who are just sick to death of living; why do we cruelly insist on forcing people to stay alive when time has robbed them of everything they enjoy about being alive? This isn't the case for everyone, of course, but when it is we need to respect their wishes and help them exit this world compassionately."
2021-04-29 13:19,"If COVID had appeared in 2010 instead of 2020 we wouldn’t have vaccines in less than one year. The death toll and the duration of the pandemic would be significantly higher.

If COVID had appeared in 2000 this article would not have been written. There was no such thing as lung transplant.

I’m not talking about 1918 or some time far back. We already had cell phones, internet, and much more. Furthermore, nearly everyone who’s been sick by COVID was alive and either an adult or teenager."
2021-04-29 13:23,"I have a second cousin (45 years old) who was a covid denier, and bullishly went through the pandemic without taking any precautions, going out for drinks with friends, telling everyone that it was a hoax. 

In january he became severely ill and was put on oxygen at home. He only came out of the woods a few weeks ago, one of his lungs has been completely ravaged by the virus and the doctors have warned him that it will be a long, slow and uncertain recovery. It is quite possible that he will never fully recover his lung function. He won't get a transplant because thankfully the other lung was not severely affected, but he is now effectively a physically disabled person, with half his breathing capacity gone.

This virus can really hit hard on people a lot younger and healthier than we expect."
2021-04-29 13:24,"I'll add a different sort of comment, as a physician who's had many end-of life conversations with patients over the years.

There's a phrase, ""a fate worse than death"". I've been impressed with how honest patients are about this, during one-on-one discussions. How often I've heard, ""I've lived a good life, doc, we don't need to take this further"". Or, ""I don't want to live that way, if I can't be as active as I am now"". And also, ""I don't want to burden my family"". Even ""What kind of life is that, spending all my time in medical offices, only to get sicker later on?"".

Many people surprise their families with strong feelings about what a life worth living is. That's why advance directives and living wills are so important for maintaining individual autonomy when illness strikes. Otherwise, the decision burdens on families, as with the author's 61 year-old patient, are overwhelming. And for those who choose to end life support, we have much to offer with medications to avoid pain, ""suffocation"", etc. That choice isn't cruel. 

COVID surely has reminded us of how life can't be taken for granted, at any age."
2021-04-29 13:34,I want to know how many of these patients were continuos non-stop smokers?

2021-04-29 13:38,"An excellent article, and a sobering look at the many repercussions of Covid, many we still don’t understand fully. 

If I may add a tangential comment: financial considerations aside, trying to get a transplant—especially a lung transplant—in this country is arduous. There is significantly more demand than supply, and patients often die in the waiting. Please consider becoming an organ donor. It is a life-saving generosity that will impact many, many lives. Be that hero.

What a story, and we humans live to tell...if not listen to them, and commiserate in desperate situations even with the potential of delaying the inevitable, in this case a lung transplant for irremediable pulmonary failure due to scaring, in this case posr-Covid. I recall, last century, as a surgical resident, when lung transplants were on the map but unreachable by mere mortals, we had to stop mechanical ventilation on older individuals in the ICU, post-op major surgery, that could not be weaned off, and transfer to regular wards, so to admit a younger patient in need of a ventilator, in our always replete Intensive Care Unit. Of course, the exitus lethalis didn't sit well with any of us, least with family members. Of note, it was a time when heavy smoking was the usual for many folks, and COPD (emphysema) an impediment to tolerate surgery without adverse results. Sad to hear things are not that much better in this day and age....for those willing to go through such a dangerous procedure...with limited success long-term, even when financial and family availability is there."

It is also exacerbated by elements of the media that have found a way to monetize that ignorance and fear."
2021-04-29 12:57,"This is a very depressing article. It leaves me with two thoughts: perhaps patients with ravaged lungs should not have been allowed to survive, and those now hooked up to lung machines should be given the option of euthanasia. It's a quality of life issue."

2021-04-29 12:46,"I don't understand why it was not mandatory to get the vaccine.
If parents don't get the vaccine then they should have had to keep their kids (who could be carriers) at home.

Getting the vaccine is a public health policy more important than speeding on the highway.

This is not a ""personal choice"" or ""freedom"" issue.

This is about all of us.

Vaccinations are mandatory for attendance in public schools.  
Big deal!

I ask people who proudly talk about their ""freedom to chose"" not to ge the vaccine these questions...

Do you wear a seat belt?
Do you drive drunk?
Do you speed?
Did you take a drug test to get hired?

Making the vaccine mandatory is a good public health policy.

Sadly, the administration (and Congress - ha, ha) should have presented the vaccine as mandatory for all citizens.  Period.

What I do think and hope will happen over time is just as some employers demand drug tests before hiring, they might start to ask for proof of Covid vaccination before letting them back in the office.

Colleges/universities and public colleges might demand proof of the Covid vaccine to attend.

I wish people could see the film about the Salk/Polio vaccine so they could see young children in ""iron lungs"" for up to 2 years and then being unable to walk.  Then, people clamored to get the polio vaccine.  With reason!

The problem is that because of the trumpying idea that the virus will just disappear, people really believe that.

To their peril.

And ours."

2021-04-29 15:08,"My dear husband died 2 years ago of progressive pulmonary fibrosis.  At the time he was diagnosed he was told there was no treatment except a lung transplant, for which at age 73.5 he was “too old.”  He lived longer than the average of 3-5 years after diagnosis - the last 2.3 of them on oxygen 24/7.

He had a wonderful lung doctor, who phoned him at the inpatient hospice on the Saturday before Easter - to say goodbye just days before his death.

I well recall Dr, Sandbo telling us at one point that a lung transplant “exchanges one disease for another.”  I’ve known 2 people who had lung transplants; both of them had repeated hospital admissions due to  complications of the transplant.

Lung disease is a terrible way to die.  One of my husband’s brothers had the same progressive fibrosis, a much younger brother who died a year before my husband.

Think long and hard about a lung transplant.  It’s just not a panacea.  No lung disease is.  Death is inevitable for each of us.  That’s the bottom line.  We should face it with dignity, no matter how it comes."

This is not a hard call; particularly given the potentially vaccine-resistant variants developing in India and S.A., getting everyone vaccinated and protecting all of us from the unvaccinated should be a national imperative.

If we play fast and lose with the virus, inevitably a variant will develop that escapes the vaccines entirely.  This would be a global disaster.

As a really important detour, there are many of use who do not have a regular support group.  Trips to distant doctors where we can't drive cost a lot, and rightly, docs are not happy about Uber of Rent-A-Friend transport.  Nor would I do that to a driver.  I think this is a huge unacknowledged barrier to regular care and treatment.  It needs to be addressed.

I sit here waiting on a kind friend who will take me for a post-op visit today, about 14 miles away.  I cannot drive until after the visit.  The surgical center left this friend in a parking lot for two hours the day of the surgery because no one (of the three people I spoke to and conveyed this info) understood or cared when I said she had to leave work 30 minutes away, don't call her until I'm alert in recovery.  So she lost a half day of work instead of two hours.  If she doesn't want to assist me again, I will completely understand that.

I watched both my parents die miserable deaths.  I spent about 8 years trying to manage a grueling work schedule as the unpaid helper-person.  I don't wish it on anyone."
2021-04-29 13:28,"The nightmare in this scenario is not an inability to grant a lung transplant. It was the part where someone woke up delirious with trach and ECMO tubes rammed into his body, who you can only hope has had no awareness of the horrors of the past few months, and is going to die soon, disabled and in pain, regardless of whether he gets a transplant--transplants don't really ""work"" the way they do on TV, and he'll likely die in less than 5 years, probably without ever seeing the outside of a hospital again.

Two weeks ago I lost a family member to cancer. He was clearly near death when he was diagnosed--he was found unconscious on the floor, too weak to eat--and would not have survived a gust of wind, let alone a full course of chemo. Yet at every step, futile options like in this article were offered optimistically. His suffering lasted a month, and he left behind an emaciated, hairless corpse still breathing artificially through his tracheostomy when we got there. I did not think to ask the doctors if he'd been given anything for his anxiety disorder until his last day. (He hadn't.)

Death is not the worst thing that can happen to someone. And it can only be postponed, not escaped. Our healthcare workers are emphatically NOT heroes; they are fallible human beings like the rest of us doing a job, and sometimes that job should not be done."

2021-04-29 15:19,"To perform a lung transplant on a patient such as the one described in this article sounds like madness to me, with a dose of cruelty as a bonus. 

In fact, I do not think a patient with irreversible lung damage who wakes up on ECMO and cannot be ex-MO-ated and extubated should have been awakened at all. 

You would be awakening that patient to a living death."
2021-04-29 14:30,I am sorry for what these COVID patients are now going through.  Please continue to publish stories about COVID patients. People who hear friends who had COVID say “it was no big deal” are often the ones who don’t get the vaccine.  We need people to understand that future health issues may crop after getting COVID.
2021-04-29 15:39,"My father had a single lung transplant at age 64 and died a month before he would have turned 70.  While nothing was easy about it, he was lucky to have had the benefit of cutting edge world class medical care at UCLA which resulted in a number of years of very successful treatment.  This allowed him not only to have a decent quality of life for a long time but also to get to know all of his grandchildren."
2021-04-29 15:43,"I had the J&J vaccine and I wonder if I should get the other vaccines now that the supply is not an issue.  (I see that there is excess supply in my state.)

My doctor is not informative and just shuts me down. 

I did the patriotic thing and took the J&J when supplies were limited.

Now I am under pressure to return to work but I don't feel I am protected.  I am in my sixties, like the man in the story.

Is there a doctor who knows the danger of getting both vaccines, J&J plus say, Moderna?"
2021-04-29 15:44,"One of my best friends died of chronic COPD in her early seventies. She had been sick for ten years unable to drive or live anything like a normal life. She kept smoking for quite awhile anyway. She couldn't breathe even  for a few minutes without oxygen and there were constant emergencies due to problems with that.  She did get to meet  her two grandchildren , one born in her last days. She wasn't a good candidate for a lung transplant, not sure why. I loved her and saw her sufferings and her courage. Her husband, a doctor, succumbed shortly after she died because the stress of keeping her alive had caused his own health, and health habits, to greatly  deteriorate.  I think she might have been better off dying sooner and her ongoing life,thanks to endless medical intervention, was not ""a gift.""  But then perhaps others in her life might see it differently ."
2021-04-29 11:46,"This is why I continue to mask up, maintain distance, and avoid sit-down restaurants and entertainment venues. I'm almost 62, and in excellent health. I'm not worried about dying from Covid. If I'm dead, I'm dead. No more worries.

I'm worried about getting Covid and never recovering my good health. A lifetime of thrift and investing gone in six months. Bankruptcy, disability, not eligible for Medicare. Going through my life savings so I can qualify for Medicaid. 

We are not out of the woods with this virus. I wish people would be more cautious."
2021-04-29 12:34,"An excellent essay, Dr. Lamas. You ask us to ""try to imagine."" I actually don't need to try. I experienced almost exactly this. It wasn't caused by covid, but a combination of lung conditions (BOOP, pulmonary hypertension) and heart conditions (failed aortic and mitral valves, VSD, Eisenmenger's) that left me on a ventilator for four weeks at Lahey Clinic and then later treated at Mass General, where I was considered for a heart-lung transplant. 

Fortunately, with excellent care from both the Lahey (Bill Gaasch, Tim Collins) and Mass General (Marc Semigran, Aaron Waxman, Chris Newton-Chen, Gus Vlahakes) teams and the hospital staff, I recovered and am now able to do most things normally. The care was expensive and I was fortunate to have great insurance, enough wealth to manage financially while having my wife (the best patient advocate in the world, I think) take time off work herself to manage my care and navigate the complexities of the American health system. I also have extensive experience consulting on employer health benefits, so I understand the system well myself and was able to sort through the Byzantine claims process. 

All I can add to your excellent essay are two comments:

1. Don't take this pandemic lightly. You never want to be in the position of Dr. Lamas's 61-year old patient or the 44-year old patient I was 16 years ago. 

2. We must reform the American healthcare system. It is far too complex and expensive for people without all the advantages I had."
2021-04-29 12:48,"As someone who had covid and was in bed at home for a month, this was my greatest fear...and still is.

I KNOW my lungs are not the same as they were. X-rays look ok, but who really knows what a covid survivor might be dealing with down the road?

If we had universal health care, I would “breathe a lot easier” in SO many ways. 

It’s the fear of the unknown, coupled with the KNOWN anxiety about the cost of healthcare in the US that is hard to bear.

I’m 59."
2021-04-29 16:06,"I am 71, it seems as if sometimes we take extraordinary risks, a high emotional toll and monetary expense and in this case the possibility of extending life for only six years. And the six years are not six years of quality life. People die every day for all kinds of reasons so we need to focus on the preventable ones within the limitations of health care. If I die I'm dead and no longer exist to care. I do know that if I can I do not want to die of Covid so in spite of being fully vaccinated I still mask up, wash my hands frequently and do not go to restaurants, taverns of indoor venues until such time as we have reached herd immunity. It would be far better to spend the tremendous resources required to give a Covid victim transplanted lungs on preventing others from being infected or in treating those with less severe after effects."
2021-04-29 16:09,"organs to be transplanted in general are in short supply. Solid organs do better overall and lungs are not considered in that category. there were already so many people waiting for lungs and now that list grows. I am an ICU physician in the sister hospital to Dr. Lamas and I have seen what she has seen. This is just one of the many examples of how people will die unnecessarily. People won't get their lungs because it will be even harder. they won't get the care they need, they won't seek medical attention in a true emergency. It has been incredibly frustrating and demoralizing this past year seeing the waste when a good portion could have been prevented. We can only do our best but is it too much for others to do the same?"
2021-04-29 15:49,"So one simple batch of questions...

What percentage of patients over 60 who were ventilated to counter COVID:

a. Have died
b. Have lung damage, to the point where they'd be a 
    transplant candidate 
c. Have lung damage that's since become chronic, 
    requiring ongoing treatment

Oh yeah – one more:

Given the anti-rejection drugs that transplant recipients have to take for the rest of their lives - what're their prospects/risks for some different viral infection, going forward.  And what’s the projected cost for the transplant/regimen – and excess costs for all other health care – per each of these lives"

Allow me just to remind readers that the ACA made a reasonable attempt to facilitate such consultations with physicians, by assigning them a procedure code so that they could be reimbursed by medical insurance.  And the Republican Party leaped on the opportunity to smear the ACA by dubbing such discussions ""death panels.""

We cannot trust the Republican Party to have our best interests at heart in ANY issue, great or small."
2021-04-29 16:21,This article left me feeling grateful that my advance directives (with a COVID rider that specifically addresses intubation) are in order. The inability of Americans to face death is a pathology all its own.
2021-04-29 16:17,"Truly gut wrenching.

COVID-19 is the scarlet fever of our times. I only wish people would understand that, and make this essential truth far more visible.

Scarlet fever killed mercilessly in the centuries before antibiotics. It was known for its brutal mortality levels, but also for the ghastly consequences of survival for many. People were left blind, deaf, crippled, or combinations of all three, in many cases. It’s the disease that ravaged the infant Helen Keller, leaving her blind and deaf…

The braying, jeering COVID-19 naysayers are always focused on the death percentages, but entirely dismiss the flip side of the coin. There is surviving, but coming out of the experience substantially disabled in some way that will forever limit their physical capabilities - or dramatically shorten their likely lifespan.

Public health officials and doctors need to speak loud and long about this side of the COVID-19 equation. For people like the ones talked about in this article, they are tragically stuck in a nightmare where the living may come to envy the dead…

For God’s sake, wear a mask! Keep social distance. And get the vaccine shot!"
2021-04-29 14:07,"I received a bilateral lung transplant on February 14, 2020 at the University of Washington in Seattle just as the pandemic was taking hold in the U.S. Everything you write reflects my experience. It is sobering to read in hindsight how emotionally heavy it is when you’re in it. I had time to think about it, to process it with my loved ones, to grieve my own death and to make the decision when I got the call. I am one of the lucky ones. But I know that it’s not just luck. I am also the beneficiary of systems that I can easily use, systems that are not equitably distributed across society."

2021-04-29 17:39,"This article was painful to read, as someone who has taken care of covid patients in an icu for 12 hours a day. I have seen all the steps up the mountain, and how painful and dehumanizing each one is. I have witnessed the decline of the patient’s body and mind at every step. The procedures, the pain, the isolation, the bedsores, the suffering, the lines, the tubes, and inhumanity of it all. I feel complicit in some of the most horrible torture we have inflicted on people since the Middle Ages. It’s awful. I don’t have the right answer, but I take issue with the author’s last quotation about taking it one step at a time up a huge mountain without taking stock of the total path ahead. It’s a long hard road, and you will not be the same person at the top. I have seen the patients with tracheostomies who have months to live, and all of those months will be in a nursing home or hospital on feeding tubes and begging to go home with their loved ones. They will never go home. 
Don’t leave the biggest decisions of your life to a medical team. Be clear with your family about how you want to live and how you want to die. Let them know that you already made the choice so they don’t have to. 
I wouldn’t inflict some of the stuff modern medicine can offer on my worst enemy."

And, it disgusts me to see foks who refuse to get the Covid vaccine or use protective measures. I am fully vaccinated and remove my mask when walking aloneor with my close circle of family who are also vaccinated. Othrwise I mask up .
This article profoundly tells us what can happen if we get infected with Covid virus. Please folks , we need to continue to be vigilant- I am tired of all this social distancing and on line get together too  but we have to continue until we get herd immunity and kids age zero to 16 can also get vaccinated. Anyone can be the recipient of ravages of this virus- so keep up the fight!"
2021-04-29 17:54,"The need for a lung transplant is of course a critical health issue. But I must point out a more mundane public health issue affecting far more people than those needing lung transplants.

Many tens of thousands of COVID patients must now take pulmonary medications for lengthy periods of time, perhaps for some indefinitely. 

I did not contract COVID, and have had my vaccine shots. That said, I've had asthma all my life (more than 60 years) and rely on pulmonary medications, tablets and inhalers of all kinds, that include corticosteroids. 

Until the COVID pandemic, I experienced no delays at my pharmacy when I refilled my prescriptions for my asthma meds. Now, a few days to a couple weeks delay is routine. My pharmacist has explained that many tens of thousands of COVID patients are now being prescribed these asthma medications.

I do not begrudge anyone who needs these medications. I know how important they are. They have helped me live a normal life some six decades now. But this situation demonstrates one more significant crack in our health care system. 

Asthma is not a rare disease. Tens of millions of us suffer from it in this country. But now some of us are in the untenable position to have to ""compete"" with many others post-COVID for our medications. And ""going without"" these medications, even for a few weeks, puts many of us asthmatics at risk for serious illness or even death. Sadly, I don't put much faith in our for-profit healthcare system to solve this problem."
2021-04-29 17:55,"I had Covid in March, 2020 and my greatest fear was being intubated. I wound up with Long Covid, and made it through with meds, supplements, three rounds of prednisone and I am still on an inhaler. I still suffer symptoms.

2021-04-29 18:34,"Transplants, as they exist in 2021, are not a new lease on life; they are money-makers for the medical industrial complex and most likely a Pandora's Box of new ailments caused by anti-rejection medications, resulting in a revolving door to the Emergency Room and lengthy hospital stays."
2021-04-29 18:46,"What was the health of this patient before becoming sick? 
Out of all the cases of Covid how many come to this point?

This article does not give enough information. 
But it sure is scary! Maybe that is the objective."
2021-04-29 18:46,"Available lungs are very rare, the screening process to receive a transplant is arduous. I know. I watched a relative with Cystic Fibrosis die while on a transplant list. Actually, they took him off the list first. That way he didn't screw up the hospital's numbers. But I digress. Very, very few of these people will have the opportunity for a transplant. So the concept of an after transplant life is almost moot. Wake up America and get vaccinated. There is no easy cure if your lungs are destroyed. You will either die, live as a pulmonary invalid or if you are lucky you will get a transplant and a second chance. But you will never really be healthy again. Get vaccinated."
2021-04-29 19:07,"Americans are the best marketers in the world, and yet we haven't been able to effectively *market* the message of how devastating covid can be in both its acute & chronic forms. NYT has a wide readership, but I can safely say that most Americans are not reading articles like this that could give them crucial perspective about what we're dealing with, perspective that could actually influence behavior and prevent another 61yo waking up to a hospital nightmare.

We need the people who are creating sexy ads for Apple, Tesla, Revlon, and other prominent brands to work on broad, sweeping communication campaigns to tell the *story* of patients like this, and of doctors like this (on billboards, in bus stop shelters, in commercials on TV, in magazine ads, on TV talk shows, on the evening news, etc). Also, to tell the *story* of the covid vaccines - how they're different, why they're effective, their relative safety - and spread this info far and wide. Get under the skin of the average American who doesn't get it and is too busy living life, taking care of family, and going to work to read opinion pieces like this in the NY Times."

He’s not going to get a transplant, let’s face it, and his on a very expensive and high-risk treatment that could kill him in any number of ways.  So where to from here?  The most humane thing would be to negotiate an ending, for him and his family."
2021-04-29 19:44,I certainly hope you'll reevaluate guidelines that say out of the gate that the self-reliant loners can't possibly be considered.

She was re-intubated several times and faced tracheostomy... She was thankfully able to get her lungs strong enough to avoid that, but it was very close.  It took her months and months to rehabilitate her body  -- and her mind.  In fact, she is still healing though she has come a long long way.  Reading this I am so thankful  for our good fortune and the hard, skilled work of her medical team.  I am also so filled with compassion  for those whose lungs have been so damaged that transplant is necessary.

On the other hand, what is it being saved for if the person can never work again, cannot afford the medications required to control rejection, doesn't have enough money to live in a safe environment, etc.?  

Medicine can do a lot.  But medicine cannot improve social policies, provide people with a safe and decent place to live, force insurance companies to pay, or force politicians to listen if their minds are made up on anything.  We are one of the only first world countries that refuses to consider health care a human right.  Owning a gun is more important."

Who is truly important enough to warrant a lung transplant? And who is important enough to decide?

It's not as if a lung transplant will enable a person to live forever. Death comes to us all and it is probably a good thing.

One doesn't have to be Christian Scientist to believe that here should be limits in our efforts to interfere wit the course of death.  Just because a medical treatment is technologically possible, doesn't mean that it is appropriate."

This is another article I will clip to my instructions, and share.  It ca be difficult to get people to envision why you would say no in advance  to interventions - - this illustrates  why.

No one will let him get a transplant - the rules for this procedure are horrendous - unless he moves to be within driving distance of the hospital.

We can't claim victory over this savage disease yet, nor will we in the end, either, with all the survivors having survived a brush with death and the effects of it to live with for the rest of their lives.

This isn't over, folks. Not by a long shot. Keep your masks on, social distance and get the vaccine if you haven't yet. 

We're almost there, but not quite."

Out of the question. There are no beds, no Oxygen, and no ICUs. Long Covid? Nobody talks about it. Get vaccinated? Sorry, the world's biggest vaccine producer has run out of vaccines after vaccinating 1.7% of the population. Perhaps survival is all that you should hope for here. After that, you are on your own."
2021-04-29 19:35,"And you still have the idiots who refuse to be vaccinated including a relative who is trying to dissuade everyone she knows to not take the injection.

They, for reasons that are unclear to me, refuse to get a COVID-19 inoculation or to follow other axiomatic and common sense steps to prevent contracting COVID themselves or spreading the infection.  They and their ""leaders"" consider this idiotic intransigence to be a badge of courage and patriotism.

Two days ago I was at the dentist.  In that dental office, FOX ""news"" is always playing on the TV in the waiting room.  The dental hygienist, who seems to be about 30, told me she has not had a COVID vaccination and doesn't want one.  Why?  Because, as she put it, ""It was rushed.  Probably unsafe.""  I'll tell you what's ""unsafe"".  If at that moment I hadn't been fully vaccinated, it would have been UNSAFE to have been between me and the door.

I thought that people from the various medical fields (I consider dentistry to be part of the medical establishment ; pretty much...) ALL were of a single mind on this issue.  My question is : what other fields that we generally think of as part of the field of Medicine have people in caregiver roles who are so out of touch with reality ?"

2021-04-21 18:31,"There have to be alternatives to full immersion and full individual isolation. If states commit testing resources, there may be safer ways to create prisoner pods, the same way families have pods, or some schools have student pods. Let people exercise together in small groups, or eat together. At least talk and socialize a few hours a day. All of these activities can be done with masks and space.

Prisons need reform and regulation alongside policing reform. If mental health is a pillar of rehabilitation, pandemic or not, everybody benefits."
2021-04-21 18:58,"Were sources such as tv, movies, books, and music available to those in isolation?

This can make a tremendous difference."
2021-04-21 19:02,The prison seems to be doing the best they can. We are all being isolated. Prisoners live in cramps quarters anyway. Would they prefer to get the virus? Those of us not in prison - are also having a difficult time with isolation. Unfortunately prisoners isolation will be in solitary confinement. We all have to deal with changes Covid-19 has brought upon us.
2021-04-21 17:52,"As of today, VT has had 22,000 confirmed covid cases and 242 deaths in a population of 625,000.  So that's an overall case rate of 35/1000 population and death rate of 0.28/1000 of the population.  With a prison population of 1400, that would indicate that you would EXPECT that there should have been zero deaths in prison (or maybe 1, if you round up) and a total of 65 infections (rather than the 456 they had).  That's not a brilliant record.

Conclusion: the VT program gave zero added benefits to prevent covid at a great cost to the prisoner's lives and mental health."
2021-04-21 18:13,Sounds like Vermont did things right.
2021-04-21 19:58,"“...Relatively few of its inmates have tested positive, and Vermont is the only state where not a single inmate has died from Covid-19. But those measures have also taken a heavy toll on many inmates’ mental health, and driven some to psychological despair....”

This, in a nutshell, is the whole problem with the various mitigation and suppression protocols that have been forced on people worldwide in the covidmania that has gripped our governments since March 2020. This whole idea that “one death is one death too many” is causing untold non-fatal damage to hundreds of thousands of people, not just prisoners in one state. We clearly have not kept this virus at bay, we haven’t “stopped the spread”, and we haven’t prevented surge after surge after surge. All we have done is inflict economic, physical and mental health damage on people everywhere. The goal should have always and everywhere only ever have been...don’t overhwelm the hospital system. Period."
2021-04-21 17:43,"I am deeply disturbed by the reader's comment that declares the health of prison workers to be far more important than that of prisoners, and which draws a line between ""the innocent"" and others. This is exactly the kind of dehumanizing rhetoric that creates the violence of our policing and carceral systems."
2021-04-21 17:48,"So many of our prisons, like this one, are located in the rural parts of the country that did so much to further the spread of the virus through their carelessness and general support of the Republican Party. As such, prisoners have been doubly endangered. They're at risk due to the communal living environment and close quarters.  They've also been at risk since they're located in communities that were proud to spread the virus.

While I commend this community for keeping the prisoners safe (and hopefully this was indicative of the community following precautions more broadly amongst themselves), I will register some disappointment that they didn't find ways to get inmates out for more regular exercise outdoors, in small groups.

I do believe that most prisoners are there for cause. We also need to recognize, as a country, that a lot of people are there unjustly. It should be enough to protect the life and dignity even of hardened criminals, but we should be especially careful knowing that some people there shouldn't even be there.

Anyway, I don't have a strong statement. Just ""good job on keeping inmates safe"" to this prison. But I'd also say to this prison that they still could have done much better."
2021-04-21 17:50,"For the most part, if you are in prison in VT, you did something to get there. The reality and lethality of the pandemic cannot be denied. The effectiveness of Vermont's prison response also cannot be denied.  One suicide and one suicide attempt needs context.  How often have these things happened historically? At the end of the day, would you rather be dead or alive and temporarily depressed?  Good job VT DOC."

2021-04-21 18:59,The isolation sounds akin to that of B's dad experience the last 3.5 yrs before his death in nursing home.  It appeared posh with gift shop and salon but like others he sat alone with no interaction day after day.
2021-04-21 21:25,"Isolation has benefits: assaults are down; infections from all infectious diseases are down, not just Covid-19; medical costs are down; prisoners are NOT learning how to be better criminals by networking with other prisoners; fewer guards are needed; less cleaning and maintenance are required since much of the facility is not in constant use.

Since prison terms are too long anyway, give prisoners a choice: one day in isolation counts as two days in the general population. I'm guessing there would be many who opt for isolation."
2021-04-21 21:34,"I'm a bit shocked at the callous indifference of the commentators. 

Our home isolation is not comparable to what these inmates experienced and presumably continue to experience. 

If cruel prison systems worked, there would not be re offenders. Our prison system is horrific and our population is largely indifferent to the suffering experienced there. 

One would think our individual experiences with the pain of a much more comfortable isolation due to Covid lock downs would soften our collective perspectives a bit. 

Put yourself in their shoes and imagine it just for a minute. 

Practice empathy not indifference."
2021-04-21 20:30,"The only thing Vermont didn't do, which I think we should have done, is vaccinate prisoners along with the residents of long-term care, in the first wave. They are helpless, and in our control. Also, they do leave prison eventually and return to the community; and corrections officers move between the prison and the community. It would have been most humane and also efficient to vaccinate them as soon as it became possible and perhaps spare them some of the agony of isolation."
2021-04-21 21:52,"Excellent article. Having worked in correctional suicide prevention for more than ten years, it is heartening to hear an administrator as frank as Mr. Baker regarding the hardship and suffering of those in segregated settings. Vermont is lucky to have such a small system where they can make changes quickly and even house correctional staff - who often are the source for infections in the prisons. 

I only have one quibble with the authors of the article. Suicide rates for prisons (as opposed to jails) are not that much higher than rates in the community. One should always remember that prisons only house only those 18 years and older, thus comparing community rates of suicide for all age groups to prisons distorts the comparison. In actuality, the rates for adults in the U.S. are slightly higher than in prisons generally, particularly for adult men."

For inmates under 50, anyway, it seems to me that the cure may have been worse than the disease."

2021-04-21 23:54,"This article fails to touch on one very important facet in helping to mitigate the spread of the virus: Ventilation. When the pandemic struck,  Vermont immediately maximized the introduction of  fresh outside air, to the greatest extent possible, to flush-out  contaminated air in its correctional facilities as well as other State owned and operated buildings."
2021-04-22 0:16,"For those that are denigrating the rights of inmates regarding vaccinations and Covid care, this is why we should care.  Because they are in congregate care with their personal rights stripped from them.  They don't have the freedom to choose their own movements, stay home, or take other safety measures to protect themselves.  Prisons have a duty of care to their prisoners, which includes health care, and respect for their human and civil rights.  Having a history of crime doesn't make these individuals less human."

2021-04-20 17:53,"The Tech industry is a sword with two edges.  

It's has undeniably been a savior for some, but at what cost?  

A new class of ""intermediary"" has imposed itself between the restaurant and the restaurant's patrons, the data-hungry food-delivery services.  They've deep pockets and may well utterly transform the restaurant business ... to their advantage and to the disappointment of the family restaurant entrepreneurs.  

A very hungry bunch of foxes have persuaded lots of restaurants to accept a bridle that helped get them safely to the other side of the pandemic river, but hereafter their hard work is not entirely their own."
2021-04-20 18:30,"Is this new restaurant normal a temporary  technical life boat during a pandemic?  

Or is it a permanent bridge to a different meaning about when, how, where and why to eating out?

Eating, drinking and cooking are all things that we can and must do at home.

Eating out was a luxurious pleasure. Or a fast convenience.

Now what?"
2021-04-20 18:45,"One can only wonder when everyone is starting-up and running a (lucrative) tech-based service layered on top of a real economy business, at what point will we turn around and realize we don’t actually have any real businesses anymore.  

Glorifying and drooling over the shiny, glossy, easy (my mom would call lazy) model of adding a layer on a real (work intensive) business is exactly what this America has become.

How about an article about a company that sits down with small restaurant owners and helps them develop their own solutions to their unique needs.  One-on-one, labor intensive, rolled up sleeves over months work which leaves the restaurants themselves better off with only a reasonable one time project fee for the work done.

My colleague was right.  During the Gold Rush the ones who really made money were not the ones working in the hot sun all day, but the ones who sold the shovels (with which most found no gold at all).

We are becoming a country which so glorifies selling shovels, at some point we won’t have any businesses left to sell them to."
2021-04-20 18:46,"The internet has become a more important part of people's lives during the pandemic. It has become central to people continuing to interact for all kinds of reasons which most would rarely do from meetings with people via services like Zoom to home delivery of goods. Employers who were reluctant to allow people to work from home, rely upon people working from home. The websites of businesses handle far more transactions, now. So the importance of websites has become far greater and a good business is designing them.

Restaurants have been allowed to operate while many merchants have not and have gone out of business. Far more people are eating at home instead at restaurants, and for a while the food distribution system had to adjust. This provides an important insight. When people each at home they can eat more healthy and it costs much less. Not patronizing restaurants can actually provide very good social outcomes, less indebtedness and better health due to better eating habits. Instead, the mass media has been focusing upon the importance of restaurants returning to full activity and robust business but mentioning nothing about all the other businesses not allowed to open and which are gone."
2021-04-20 18:57,"Even when the pandemic is over I suspect this type of e-commerce with restaurants will continue.

Another phenom that we have seen grow out of this situation that depends on and relates to e-commerce is the ""Pop Up Kitchen"" where either an individual or a corporation rents extra kitchen space at various brick and mortar restaurants. 

It allows such places to generate extra revenue and also decreases the cost of starting a ""new"" restaurant tremendously.

Some commercial spaces have been converted to only this use and I suspect that will continue to grow as well, especially when the physical restaurants renting kitchen space out get back to full swing and need that space back.

Basically it's any large commercial space filled with many individual commercial grade complete kitchens. You rent space for a week, a month, a year or whatever. No big investment to be a restauranteur and a MUCH bigger chance of succeeding."

Bottom line - U.S. taxes and U.S. scientists have been essential in this technology.  Government expenditures do produce results."

I have always wondered and have been amazed at how this process begins and ends up to the point where the vaccine shipped out.  This article really helps break the process down, explaining it to me on the most basic yet crucial elements.

I love the quote from Katherine Calhoun in which she stated ""Rarely do you work on something in the lab and go home and turn on your TV and see the top 10 headlines are about the thing that you were working on today.""  How incredibly cool and rewarding is that?

What a great photo of the President ""watching trays of vaccine going into cold storage at Pfizer's Kalamazoo facility.""  President Biden is keenly interested.

2021-04-28 14:55,"I used to work for PFE at the NYC HQ in drug development.  The scientific progress in the last 20 years is flabbergasting, for lack of a better word.  Now retired, I'm helping out with our county's vaccine clinics (we have no hospital or chain pharmacies).  We've been doing all Moderna because we could store it, but are getting our first batch of PFE product this week for the 16-18 year olds.  The National Guard will deliver it to the high schools (we have 2 in the county) for administration to anyone over 16.  We've been able to vaccinate 75% of our population.  Every step, from the initial cells into patients' arms, is amazing."
2021-04-28 14:55,"Thank you NYT for this wonderful presentation. As a molecular biologist (retired) I performed some of the steps mentioned in the lab - but on a crude, minuscule scale by comparison. It's cool to see how the technology can be ramped up to meet the demand for vaccines in a global pandemic."
2021-04-28 14:57,"Fascinating and inspiring.  What miracles we humans are capable of.  Kudos to the scientists, engineers, machinists, technicians, quality control, transport and administrative teams who make this all possible, and who take their collective responsibility so seriously.  More like this, please!"
2021-04-28 14:59,"A wonderful and enlightening piece on these vaccines. 

It is remarkable that these mRNA technologies have roots in immigrant stories. The Pfizer vaccine-- in a German scientist whose parents immigrated to Germany for factory work from Turkey. And the Moderna mRNA technology which was co-founded by, in a perhaps remarkable twist on history, an Armenian immigrant to the US whose family were refugees and survivors of the Genocide of the Armenians by Turkey decades ago.

Immigrants are indeed a boon to the US, and the US acceptance of refugees, the persecuted and the oppressed remains a fundamental pillar of our dynamism today."
2021-04-28 15:00,"Simply incredible. I felt so fortunate to have received this vaccine. I knew it was a big deal to make, but had no idea it was this complex. Thank you Pfizer and NYTimes for showing us this astounding process. #getstabbed"
2021-04-28 15:05,"In awe, really. The innovation, engineering, coordination, logistics, and dedication are fascinating and inspiring."
2021-04-28 15:07,Wonderful enlightening article. Should I hazard a guess and say this information is still a condensed version of the science? Of course it is. I appreciate the knowledge and skills of those who have chosen this profession. No one should underestimate the complexity and the care being demonstrated here. Thank-you
2021-04-28 15:13,"A Pulitzer Prize would be well deserved for this reporting! And, I extend my admiration and thanks to Pfizer and all the scientists who have made the vaccine a reality!"
2021-04-28 15:15,Incredible vaccine making process. Incredible reporting.
2021-04-28 13:38,Incredibly complex...worth watching just for the embedded clips.
2021-04-28 15:14,How lucky we are to live in the 21st century. Unfortunately a large minority seem to want to live in the middle-ages and refuse to join society in eliminating this virus.
2021-04-28 13:51,"A key point here: these are GMO bacteria that produce the vaccines. There are no stem cells involved in the production.

At a vaccine clinic I had to explain this to a woman who was concerned about stem cells. This will be handy if it comes up again. 

But I also wonder: how people who hate pharma think this would get done otherwise. You want academics and grad students making this in their grubby labs? How does that work exactly?"
2021-04-28 14:20,"“When the lipids come into contact with the naked strands of mRNA, electric charge pulls them together in a nanosecond.”

Incredible. Investment (and belief) in science really does pay off."
2021-04-28 14:17,"Science works!

Imagine what can be done by bringing basic science funding to where it should be?"
2021-04-28 14:46,"This is interesting but omits a really important part. How is the ""Master DNA"" created at the very start of the process described?"
2021-04-28 15:21,"How extraordinary a creation and process, pure magic, and how wonderful and informative is the NY Times, for educating readers and the world. God bless the media."
2021-04-28 15:33,Never has an article on mass production brought tears to my eyes. Until now.
2021-04-28 15:34,My suspicion was that eggs were not used as a propagating medium for the mRNA vaccines. This article seems to confirm that.  I've encountered several people who say they are allergic to the vaccine (they assume it is egg-based). It'd be nice to have an accurate rebuttal.
2021-04-28 15:36,"This was absolutely FASCINATING! Thank you so much for a wonderful story, Ms. Cott, Mr. deDruyn, and Mr. Corum. 

Not only do we have the brilliance of the people doing the work, but the people who made this machinery. The ones who built the labs and plants. The ones who manage logistics. The ones who keep the facilities pristinely clean so a safe product can be sent out. 

It's amazing to see in layman's terms how it all comes together. 

Sometimes people aren't so bad after all."
2021-04-28 15:44,"WOW WOW WOW thank you for this article.  Just fascinating.  I can't say enough how wonderful it was to read  the good that human beings can be and do for a change.  Those sparkling clean labs, and that equipment!  And the international coming together, just so so good to read.  This article deserves nothing short of a a Pulitzer.  Uplifting and hopeful....I was in tears by the end!!"
2021-04-28 15:45,Incredible insight into an amazing process. Thanks NYT for the depth of explanation and reporting here!
2021-04-28 15:46,"As a retired research scientist in a related area, I would like to congratulate The Times on this clear and informative article. Well done!"
2021-04-28 15:48,These explanations and illustrations are great. Thank you.
2021-04-28 15:52,Wonderfully written and illustrated article.  Wouldn't it make more sense to eliminate the transportation of unfinished product between locations which have different roles.  Why not do everything at the same site?  This would be more efficient and deliver the finished product in a shorter period of time.
2021-04-28 15:57,And this is why I pay for the NY Times. Really interesting read for a current event. Intriguing and nice to see the process of what was injected into my arm recently. Thank you!
2021-04-28 15:59,"Some of you may have missed the details of the quality-control and containment process, which is vital for everyone's safety. Vials are held from shipping for weeks while numerous and complex quality checks are done. Contrast this to the automotive industry, which ships millions of vehicles per year whereas vaccines are shipped in quantities of millions per DAY. You dont have the ""luxury"" of doing a recall to fix a quality issue once a dose is poked into someone's arm."
2021-04-28 16:02,"I work in a rural, Critical Access Hospital and have been involved in planning and volunteering at our mass vaccination clinic. Getting this inside look into the incredible process of manufacturing and distributing a safe and effective vaccine moved me to tears. It's emotional partly to see the very place and talented people who made my vaccine a reality, but also to witness such advanced human ingenuity. I feel a deeper connection between all the people involved in helping save lives. Seeing the complexity of the process and how it has resulted in such an effective vaccine gives me hope for the future of our country and world."
2021-04-28 16:03,"and science wins!! for some of the readers - not all the talent, resources and facilities are in the same places today.  the sites are experts at what they do so rather than move people, buildings, infrastructure etc - they move the materials."
2021-04-28 16:04,"Those refusing to take the vaccine should read this.  It will either move them to take it, or solidify their science denying.  However many are moved to vaccinate will be a plus..."
2021-04-28 16:05,"Illustrates beautifully why calls for waiving patent rights are absurd.  Making the mRNA vaccines is not a trivial exercise.  How long would it take others to get mRNA vaccine production up and running smoothly?  It is far better to focus on viral vector vaccines, which have already been licensed and multiple sites have experience making."
2021-04-28 16:05,Feeling immense gratitude for all of the people up and down the line of this process. Words can't really describe it.
2021-04-28 13:38,"A miracle on earth, brought to you by scientists, physicians and capitalists :-))"
2021-04-28 15:07,Well done on your presentation here. I really appreciate how you used mixed media to explain the vaccine process to me. The NY Times is the Pfizer of journalism :)
2021-04-28 15:46,Nice job reporting on this. Fascinating.
2021-04-28 15:53,Would that Edward Jenner were alive to see where his insights into vaccines have gone and what has been done with them. I'm certain he'd be awed and overjoyed.
2021-04-28 14:24,"Thank you! Fantastic article. ""clapping"""
2021-04-28 14:34,Mazel tov!
2021-04-28 15:01,"Here in Brazil, I liked to read, this good article."
2021-04-28 13:37,This is better than sci-fi movies.
2021-04-28 14:28,"This is fascinating, but raises the obvious question: Where does this begin? Where does the 'master dna bank' come from?"
2021-04-28 14:35,"makes me wonder how many years it would take for china to make an effective mRNA vaccine.

given all the news about china making their own mRNA vaccine, i think it would be better if they just bought from moderna/pfizer."
2021-04-28 15:59,American ingenuity at its best.
2021-04-28 16:05,I don't see Donald Trump's in the video anywhere.  Wasn't he critical at every stage?
2021-04-28 15:32,"I am 17. I just got my first dose of the Pfizer-BioNtech vaccine this morning.

Let me reiterate this: if you are eligible, get the vaccine. Science works. I waited 15 months to see my friends because I am not selfish.

Save lives!"
2021-04-28 15:41,"What a fascinating deep dive into how mRNA vaccines are made. For those who crave the details, this account is like a full length science movie, even better because you can go back and review the details. It also humanizes the process, showing the people who participate along the manufacturing process, culminating in those who deliver the life-saving product.

I would have paid for this ""article""which is really a mini-course in how a vaccine is produced in the 21st century. Thank you NYT."
2021-04-28 15:29,"Nice piece of journalism   I hope it helps erase doubts from those reluctant to get vaccinated   Myself,wife,kids and close friends,all vaccinated,had a  wonderful  get together.   Please do not hesitate to get yourself family and friends vaccinated   The world needs every shot we can produce"
2021-04-28 16:11,Superb communication—absolutely entrancing. The heroic and astonishing capabilities of all the developers and manufacturers of high quality vaccines are so worthy of our gratitude.
2021-04-28 16:11,"Thanks for a great read. But there is one more step - can you show how the vaccine, in the body, does its job?"
2021-04-28 15:28,"How ... how ... how can a nation that produces such amazing, complex, and miraculous medical technology also elect morons to supervise our democracy? Why don’t we apply the same care and control to elected office as we do to scientific accomplishments like the vaccine?"
2021-04-28 14:35,Brilliant
2021-04-28 16:06,Thank you so much
2021-04-28 13:38,amazing

2021-04-28 14:29,Excellent article !
2021-04-28 13:48,Science for humanity!! Bravo
2021-04-28 16:12,So amazing!
2021-04-28 16:14,"Believe Science. Science builds in testing, verification, and validation and is always asking the questions of how to do hard things, how to do them better. If you survived the pandemic, and have been vaccinated, you have SCIENCE to thank."
2021-04-28 16:15,"Unlike the moonshot, this is all happening out of the public eye, but this article shows that's just what the effort to create a vaccine, and get it into arms is: our 21st century moonshot, only with a lot more at stake."
2021-04-28 16:15,"I received the Pfizer vaccine at Worcester State University super-site and was happy for it.  But I had no idea of the lengths Pfizer undertook to insure that every dose is effective.  That half of the 60 days it takes to produce are dedicated to testing.  Many, many thanks to the workers that made this possible."
2021-04-28 16:26,"In ""normal"" times, I would look carefully at a feature like this to see whether it's a paid promotion from Pfizer. But now, anything that encourages people to get vaccinated is a Good Thing."
2021-04-28 16:39,"So... I was going to ask why the components are shipped around so much BUT was happily informed by the knowledgeable comments below.
This is an amazing article that was substantially enhanced by the information passed on by the commentary.
Thank you to all."
2021-04-28 16:41,Excellent work and brilliant idea -- extra kudos to whoever came up with the idea for this piece.
2021-04-28 16:42,"Fascinating!  I've been waiting for an explanation of how the vaccine is made, and this one does an excellent job detailing the collective genius and heroic efforts on the part of thousands of scientists and technicians that led to the remarkably quick creation of this life-saving drug. History will look back on this audacious scientific undertaking as one of the high points of the 21st Century."
2021-04-28 16:45,"Very interesting insight into the production of a corona vaccine, I just received my first 'shot' - and I feel better (already).

What about a similar story on how they came to the recipe used in the production - when the 'road to success' wasn't that obvious."
2021-04-28 16:14,"Incredibly informative article that is both clear and easy-to-read. Quotes and video clips make it even more interesting. Thanks for doing a great job!

How is the vaccine itself sterilized without damaging the RNA?"
2021-04-28 16:29,"To everyone who thinks the scientists are out to get them: think about the knowledge and brilliance and ingenuity that went into this modern miracle. If these people had it in for you, you'd be long, long dead."
2021-04-28 16:30,"Great article, it is nice to know how the mRNA is produced and packaged, I thought they were synthesizing DNA first and then transcribing. I have one comment though: the author of the article states that E. coli cells (with the plasmid) ferment. Sorry, they don't...in microbiology, fermentation refers to an anoxic process, meaning there is no oxygen (or other terminal electron acceptors). To make a lot of plasmid DNA, you want your E. coli cells to be ""happy"" and grow as much as they can, this is why they aerate and shake/stir the cells. Cells use oxygen (aerobic respiration) and grow better compared to a no oxygen situation (fermentation). So no fermentation here !"
2021-04-28 16:41,"Again and again we see how specialized the modern word has become.  

If this had been made into a TV show last year and shown in place of Trumps speeches on all the networks, esp. FOX NEWS,  perhaps millions of Americans would still be alive.

It should still be put on TV and broadcast as a national emergency."
2021-04-28 16:46,"The Moderna vaccine also uses mRNA, but does not require the deep freeze and the on-site dilution step which the Pfizer vaccine does. It would be interesting for the NYT to explain why."
2021-04-28 16:36,This is the type of article makes my subscription worthwhile.
2021-04-28 16:39,"To learn how the DNA to mRNA process works, read excellent new book about the woman who helped discover and create the process based on Crisper technology: Code Breaker: Jennifer Doudner, Gene Editing and the Future of the Human Race by Walter Isaacson."
2021-04-28 16:11,"This is a wonderful article and I'm glad I saw it this morning as I'm on my way to my first shot.  However, Pfizer lists the following ingredients in the vaccine: potassium chloride, monobasic potassium phosphate, sodium chloride, dibasic sodium phosphate dihydrate, and sucrose.  I wish the article had included an explanation of these as additives in the process."
2021-04-28 16:57,"It is not really correct to call these production workers ""scientists"".   They are skilled technicians who know how to make the vaccine, but they don't have to understand complicated theory to do their job.   You just have to responsible, careful, and understand basic lab technique.

The machines are impressive.   Pfizer spent $2 billion to buy the machines before the vaccine was fully developed, which was a very aggressive move on their part.   Pfizer already working on a modified booster shot to be given in the fall, so they will be getting further utilization out of these machines and generate more revenue."
2021-04-28 17:06,"IF THE HUMANS COULD BE THIS GENIUS, IMAGINE THE INGENUITY OF THEIR CREATOR! The process of producing a vaccine for this deadly virus, as I read it, is beyond mind-boggling! I am surprised Pfizer allowed the filming of the entire vaccine-making process. Kudos to them! Moderna declined it. I salute the New York Times for providing its readers with the opportunity to read and view the vaccine-making process. Bravo for filming this process!"
2021-04-28 17:30,"When we discovered the role of  plasmids as an  explanation for how nature rapidly  facilitates bacteria's development of  antibiotic resistance it was ground breaking.  To see its application in the development of influenza vaccines and now these mRNA vaccines, is awe inspiring and just the beginning of  great things  we will be able to accomplish medically in the near future."
2021-04-28 17:37,Reading this article on an island in the State of Hawaii instills such gratitude for this amazing process to develop a vaccine.  My husband and I were vaccinated with two doses of the Pfizer vaccine last month.  This article demonstrates what technicians and scientists can achieve.   Mahalo nui loa!
2021-04-28 17:39,We have certainly come a long way from inactivated virus.   Very awe inspiring process.  All the more reason STEM is important in education.
2021-04-28 17:42,"Virtually every step in this process was discovered by basic research in molecular biology over the past 50 years, and is a testament to the scientific research done at the NIH, research universities, research institutes and private companies. It is the cumulative knowledge of hundreds upon hundreds of scientists across the globe that make these advancements possible.  And in reality it is your tax dollar that helped fund much of the research and training required for producing life saving miracles like these vaccines."
2021-04-28 17:43,"This article is worth an entire year's subscription to NY Times.
This is absolutely fascinating.  History will remember this as our generation's moon landing.  Thank you so much for this reporting, absolutely amazing."
2021-04-28 17:44,"I find this article incredibly powerful and moving-- thank you for putting it together. It only heightens my respect for the science, and the PEOPLE that make it possible. Just got my first Pfizer dose. Thank you, thank you."
2021-04-28 17:51,Amazing article. The ability for people to produce something so advanced at such a scale is inspiring.
2021-04-28 17:54,"This is an awesome process, no doubt.  I have received both doses of the Pfizer vaccine and am very grateful to every person involved in its production.  I appreciate the brilliance and hard work that went into its development.  I'm slightly concerned about this:  ""Synchronizing eight pairs of pumps is not an ideal solution, but Pfizer engineers chose to scale up existing technology instead of trying to build a larger, unproven type of precision mixing device"".  The implication seems to be that, given less time urgency, the better way to do it would be to build that precision mixing device.  Perhaps future vaccine production will use such a device, in which case we must ask: Do early vaccine recipients receive a sub-optimal mixture of lipids and mRNA?"
2021-04-28 18:10,this is incredible. how they came up with this process with the new platform in such a short amount of time is mind-boggling.
2021-04-28 18:10,"Thank you so much for this article! I now understand how my own two doses of Pfizer vaccine were created. I also understand the awesome responsibility the scientists and support staff have: they are not producing kitchen utensils, but a life saving biological agent to help all of us."
2021-04-28 18:19,"This is an awesome story on a breathtakingly amazing process pushed along by wonderful people at all stages. It makes you proud to be a human being. Of course, it helps to be high up in the food chain, well above the trillions of bacteria killed in Step 4. I will always look at E. Coli with gratitude from now on."
2021-04-28 18:20,"I retired from Pfizer's Groton CT site in December 2020.  I did not work on the covid vaccine but this story and the video clips captured the same spirit and atmosphere that I saw at Groton.  I worked with many superb, quality driven scientists and engineers on the development and scale-up of  drug product dosage forms.  The scientists and engineers were from around the world.  The managers were excellent.  Our drug product team meetings were filled with data analysis, discussion and collaboration.  The work environment is stimulating. The pace and expectations are high.  
Few in the outside world understand the challenges of scale-up and quality control. BioNTech could have chosen another corporate partner but I think they made a wise choice in Pfizer."
2021-04-28 18:22,Thank you so much for this article. The production process is awesome!!!!!.  My Husband and I received our two Pfizer shots from Kaiser in January and February.  We had no medical issues and we are very fortunate .
2021-04-28 18:59,"Two somewhat technical points about this excellent article:
1. The article says that in the big (300 liter) fermenter the E. coli cells are doubling every twenty minutes for four days. A well-known textbook example of exponential microbial growth is that if you start with a single E. coli cell and let it double every twenty minutes (3 doublings/hr), after 20 minutes you get two cells (2 to the first power), after 40 minutes you get 4 cells (2 to the 2nd power), after 60 minutes you get 8 cells (2 to the 3rd power), and so on. After two days (48 hrs) there would have been 144 (48 x 3) doublings and 2 to the 144th power cells, about 2 x 10 to the 43rd power cells. A few more calculations show that they would weigh more than the Earth, and that's after only two days. So growth would have to have been slower, possibly limited for oxygen bubbled through the growth medium (aeration)."
2021-04-28 19:03,"In the face of the negativity in the country, and particularly in my state of Michigan, it is fantastic to read about a business located here doing such a fine job to save us all.
I'm sure they are making money for the investors as well. There is a lesson in here, if only we learn it. I still think of the mask guy in Texas who could have supplied masks made here, if only the government would give him a contract.  I hope his company made out OK.
From all the harping about having to act like a responsible community minded citizen in Michigan, this is a great change of pace."
2021-04-28 19:10,"I'll never grow tired of this story. It's ""man on the moon"" stuff and will be talked and written about for generations. This interactive profile was outstanding. There are so many people to celebrate. But I'll settle for ""Bravo, science""."
2021-04-28 19:12,Thank you for creating this wonderful article and all the wonderful visuals! I am a microbiologist and I truly appreciate the level of detail and precision. But I am particularly grateful for the elegant and yet simple presentation of the science. I am sharing it with everyone I can.

2021-04-28 17:07,This restores my faith in humanity's will to survive. And a great production overall by the NYT. Happy to have two doses of Pfizer's vaccine in me right now
2021-04-28 16:50,"Thank you for this excellent article!
We need more articles like this instead of reporting on people's stupidity and arrogance, more recognition for scientists, and less for people which excel in stupidity.
COVID-19 vaccines have been a triumph of science, which often made progress in spite of obstacles by politicians or church.  
Also thank you on a great article on Kati Keriko the other day... people need to know these things. Her focus and persistence made all this possible!"
2021-04-28 17:08,It is not time to profit from mRNA COVID vaccines. Please make the patents public to save the world.

2021-04-28 17:23,"I complain plenty about the NYT's but this is ...

Truly Excellent Work."
2021-04-28 17:58,Seems pretty efficient.  Not as efficient as chugging bleach though.
2021-04-28 18:18,"Do you know how Pfizer REALLY makes that vaccine?

Step 1: Pick up the phone that is ringing
Step 2: Talk to the guy from BioNTech
Step 3: Agree to a contract

I live about 30 miles away from BioNTech HQ and I can't STAND that they don't get the credit they deserve:

- they were the first! 
- and it worked at 95+% from the get-go!
- even against unknown variants!
- and with less side effects than others!

Yes, Pfizer and BioNTech had a research agreement for mRNA. But it was that plucky German company that had the intellectual spark, the ingenuity, to try that technology on Covid-19 when the level of the problem became apparent. 

The founders of BioNTech already got the highest civilian German award (and a few million Euros in gains on their stock options, I expect), but I want to see something along the lines of a Nobel for them!

Just saying, not that kind of a local patriot normally, but it really riles me..."
2021-04-28 18:30,"As a science writer, I appreciate the clear and succinct language used to explain this amazing new technology to the public. I've been reading John Barry's ""The Great Influenza"" about how researchers worked to end the horror of the 1918 influenza pandemic, ultimately creating a vaccine that killed the accompanying pneumonia: ""All real scientists exist on the frontier...in this wilderness, the scientist must create everything...their probing acts like a crystal to precipitate order out of chaos."" Thanks to Pfizer and NYT for taking us to the edge of a new vaccine technology so that we may be less hesitant about taking advantage of it. P.S. I was scheduled for a Pfizer vaccine but had to cancel because I got shingles--oops, didn't take the shingles vaccine!"

This is the private sector – albeit incentivized by the public sector…

Not that every commentor lauding NIH and gov’t 𝙧𝙚𝙨𝙚𝙖𝙧𝙘𝙝 agencies mistaken…

US gov’t 𝙧𝙚𝙜𝙪𝙡𝙖𝙩𝙤𝙧𝙮 agencies – another matter…

Why, by – like yesterday – isn’t CDC leadership telling Joe the US health care system should be:

> Sequencing every instance of human viral infection in the US – within 48 hours of detection

> Maintaining a properly-anonymized central database, constantly regressing new virome and geolocation information to have a real-time handle on contagion/virulence. In emergencies of several kinds, gov’t could de-anonymize the data to alert a/o treat people – including those who’ve been in contact

> On a similar system, constantly analyzing the physical expression (i.e., shapes, binding locations) of this collective virome – and how it might evolve

> Coordinating with top-tier pharmas – on a pre-competitive basis (candy company figured this out for food safety, a while ago) – to determine which RNA segments would most effectively vaccinate, and whether any roadblocks to immediate production

2021-04-28 18:03,I'm surprised no one has complained about the high use of dry ice and the carbon footprint it creates. Don't worry. It's bound to happen.
2021-04-28 18:07,Amazing. Thanks for the article.
2021-04-28 18:44,We pray for miracles and yet we are blind to see when our prayers are answered. This IS a miracle.
2021-04-28 19:07,"It's not too much to say that Pfizer (and Moderna) have saved our country.  

If you look at what's going on in India, the same thing could be happening here if it were not for these two companies and their remarkably effective vaccines."
2021-04-28 19:12,"The scientists are working hard for us, putting knowledge to practice. It is as amazing that with all these resources involved, governments can make the vaccines available for the public for FREE!!!

If there is a will, there is a way."
2021-04-28 19:27,"Emma, Your prose and video are OUTSTANDING. I have a few questions and observations: I was really surprised DNA production takes 4 days ... PCR uses just ONE day to achieve 5* 10^21 a huge number, but Pfizer DNA in e-coli needs 4 days for a multiplication of 5 * 10^86, astounding numbers ... why the difference? Interesting that Moderna declined video, a huge lost PR effort. 
Do the restrictions cut precisely where needed or some extra at each end?
I had to give some thought to the DNR vs mRNA ... notable that one amino acid in RNA is different than DNA.
Not sure why plasmid is a ring?  CRISPR needed to compare sequence of plasmid to linear DNA?
Quite surprised at the length and complexity of the supply chain
Surprised that the ethanol associated with the lipid must be eliminated
Surprised that mRNA packaged in lipid electrostatically, but makes sense as both elements are polar"
2021-04-28 17:35,"Thank you for the report.

Question, given we are at war with the Virus
why are not more plants up and running 
to create as many vaccines as possible ?"
2021-04-28 17:15,The humans shown here are some very good people. Not all humans are like this. Thank you NY Times for this article.
2021-04-28 19:40,"Thank you for the most informative article. It opened my eyes to the process involved and built my faith in them.  What a great achievement, what a great people. I am humbled."
2021-04-28 19:42,"This is a great article, worth the price of my monthly subscription.  Thanks New York Times for the fantastic work!"
2021-04-28 19:43,"Orchestrating this complex process is an astounding feat of science and technology. Videos of this process and the science behind it should be broadcast and streamed regularly in mass media. 

Why? Because the general public needs to learn just how good our science is, and the immense respect everyone involved deserves + how caring and sensible we can be if we just put our collective hearts and minds into it.

Most everyone demands outcomes and cares little about what it takes to get them. We need to constantly educate ourselves and not take the world or others around us for granted. Even if it means rubbing noses in what it takes to build such awareness and appreciation. 

Thanks for this very informative piece."
2021-04-28 19:57,"Heroes at work! What an incredible feat Pfizer and other vaccine makers are performing to protect us all from this terrible virus.

Thank you, New York Times, for this most informative article!"
2021-04-28 20:01,"Brilliant seems such an inadequate word for all this. Thank god for the gifted teams of scientists and technicians who ""cook the soup,"" and the engineers who built the ""kitchen"" to safely mass-produce it."
2021-04-28 20:10,"For a follow-up, it would be great to have a discussion of which of these steps are harder or easier to scale up, which are harder or easier for other other companies to undertake, and which are encumbered by patent protections and which aren't. As recent reporting on the other vaccines has made clear, the world desperately needs vastly more of these vaccines immediately and will for many months to come. Any light you can shed in follow-up articles on how these steps can and can't be scaled up or copied by others would be much appreciated!"
2021-04-28 20:26,"Everybody should be aware of this level of complexity. And it doesn't even show the mammoth task of documentation and record-keeping for regulatory purposes. Nobody would then be wondering why we can't just ""build more plants"" as if they were just some sort of big barn or storage shed."
2021-04-28 20:34,"I honestly can't begin to understand this, but I certainly can feel enormous appreciation for the dedicated, brilliant souls who have made this vaccine happen.  True heroes all."
2021-04-28 20:34,DOPE!  This was a beautiful article.  The live illustrations and simple explanations are so needed to help folks understand what is involved with creating what we are putting in our bodies.  Kudos to Phizer and BioNTech for being so transparent with their process it goes to show that they really are giving us a quality product!  Calling out Moderna and Janssen to provide a similar glimpse into their process.
2021-04-28 20:44,Thanks for the enlightening article which gave me a deeper understanding of the complexity and quality control which goes into the manufacture of the vaccine.
2021-04-28 20:53,"Thanks for this, I've been wondering how this all scales to produce billions of vaccines. 

One thing I didn't find answered here is what kinds of byproducts are produced by the process and how are they disposed of."
2021-04-28 21:00,"This made me dizzy.

In a good way."
2021-04-28 21:01,"As Mechanical Engineer, that worked in manufacturing all my life, I really appreciated the article. Is not easy to understand and quantify the commitment of the people involved in this project, probably the most important one in decades. A Salute to them!

As Thomas Alba Edison said: “There is no substitution for the hard work…”

Thanks"
2021-04-28 17:20,Kudos to NYTimes and the journalist who wrote this article. Amazing
2021-04-28 17:22,"For anyone interested, National Geographic did a documentary detailing the entire Pfizer vaccine from the moment the pandemic started. It's called Mission Possible: The Race for a Vaccine and it's free on Youtube. <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbZUZ9JYNBE"" target=""_blank"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbZUZ9JYNBE</a>

Really fascinating and more importantly, I feel it really humanized everyone working on this vaccine. Sometimes we think these companies are just about money but I think with this vaccine it was different (to a certain extent)."
2021-04-28 17:27,Amazing!
2021-04-28 18:23,"These video clips brought tears down my cheeks.  Thank you, thank you, thank you!"
2021-04-28 13:50,"Beautiful multi-media tour of the Pfizer mRNA vaccine production process. Thank you. 

I read a blog post by a guy in the know (professional) who explained the difficulties in upscaling the mRNA vaccines. This was published online Feb. 2, 2021:

2021-04-28 17:08,"Some inaccuracies aside, this article is so great, so beneficial to the public. The only folks who would not benefit from this information are those who suspect NYT as part of a myriad of conspiracies, which, of course, only they understand. Their big loss."
2021-04-28 20:23,All you can say after reading and watching this is WOW!!!  To say it is totally amazing is a supreme understatement.  We owe a huge debt of gratitude to the people who put everything they had into developing these vaccines.
2021-04-28 21:02,This was very informative. Thank you.
2021-04-28 21:10,"I quite literally just returned from getting my first shot (Phizer).
I'm now eating ice-cream as a reward.

I'll read this article in a bit..."
2021-04-28 21:20,Terrific. Thank you as always
2021-04-28 19:42,"It still hasn’t really hit me what a miracle it is to have such effective vaccines. Thank you to all these workers, scientists, doctors, nurses and volunteers at administration sites."
2021-04-28 19:46,"This is all science. Maybe if more people knew science, they wouldn't be fooled by those who say it is all a scam."
2021-04-28 21:21,"Many years ago I worked with Pfizer personnel on a drug development project, particularly their CT and IN locations. I would describe their R&D and Mfg/Quality staff as top notch, top to bottom. A 'tip of the hat' to all that helped get this vaccine to the American public."
2021-04-28 21:36,"The only limit of the ability of the vaccine and future iterations of the vaccine to conquer the pandemic is the ignorance of humans who refuse to get vaccinated for their own benefit and for the benefit of their fellow humans. Because of human nature, I'm afraid that we will never achieve heard immunity and that we will have to live with a state of chronic pandemic for years. Darwin's spirit is laughing."
2021-04-28 21:39,Will the strategy of preparing a vaccine using a cocktail of plasmids expressing all the variants work? Is this strategy being tested?
2021-04-28 21:51,Rarely do I get to see such beautiful evocation of what I regard as a miracle--albeit a miracle rooted in decades of hard incremental work.  Thank goodness for these folks.
2021-04-28 22:13,"Absolutely amazing!
We are so fortunate.
Bittersweet as well.
But how many millions of lives will be saved.
Pray we are better prepared for the next one."
2021-04-28 18:28,Note to evangelicals : this is how God protects you from the virus.
2021-04-28 17:57,"Great article ,incredibly informative. Thank you
to express Plasmid with mutant DNA at E.coli is a standard procedures what is impressive innovations are transform specific DNA to mRNA This techniques may be used to make vaccines  for many proteins which Couse  not treatable disease  ,like some kind of  cancers, Neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's  making mRNA against   amyloid peptides/proteins ,it's much wider possibilities as people focused on Covid-19  now. Thanks again"
2021-04-28 18:55,super good story'
2021-04-28 17:54,All I can say is... WOW!
2021-04-28 16:45,"Great process - now let's act like the Global hegemon we purport to be and distribute this vaccine to India, Brazil, and the many other countries still suffering from the COVID-19 pandemic instead of offering up AstraZeneca shots we don't have, haven't approved, and will be manufactured by a plant in Baltimore with known quality control issues. Tell me - is this how the US treats its allies?

2021-04-28 18:39,Excellent article!
2021-04-28 19:26,Never read such an informative article. This is the world class standard of prestigious Nytimes.
2021-04-28 22:02,"Literally just got the second dose of Pfizer today! Coming from a teenager, thank you for everything you do!"
2021-04-28 21:22,Fantastic tour. Thank you.
2021-04-28 22:17,"Thank you very much for this insightful article. Now we need to come up with a super-patience pill for those of us, who must cope with other mature adults, who have the narrow view of the pharma industry... their biases clearly have not moved beyond the mortar, pestle and compound. I fear, we will cope with these theorists for months to come. I prefer the long view, my second shot is this Sunday afternoon. I will be relieved to accomplish that."
2021-04-28 22:27,"Fantastic article. BTW, Pfizer acquired the legacy business of Lederle Laboratories (for whom I worked many years ago), after its journey through several pharmaceutical companies.  Lederle 
produced one of the two polio vaccines that rescued so many of us in the 1950s.  Great to see this life-saving tradition carried on so masterfully.   In getting my COVID-19 vaccine from Pfizer, I felt things had come full circle."
2021-04-28 22:27,"The scale of this human achievement is mind-blowing. That we achieved so, so much in such a short and pressure-packed amount of time is a testament to the dedication and craft of these scientists, engineers, and team members. The intricacy and quality controls required are incredible. 

This may very well represent the pinnacle of what our species has been able to do, so far, and gives optimism for the other major problems facing the world today."
2021-04-28 22:28,"Within a week of the release of the Covid-19 genome by Chinese scientists,Dr. Ugur Sahin, founder of Bio-NTech, and his wife Dr. Ozlem Tureci, also a scientist, began work on the mRNA vaccine which would be known as the Pfizer-Bio-NTech. Both were immigrants from Turkey; Dr. Tureci was born in Germany of Turkish parents who had emigrated years before.
 I wish all Americans were aware of these heroes and appreciate the contributions that immigrants can make and have made to this country.
 Their vaccine has saved millions of lives and will save many millions more. Thank you so much for your dedication and hard work."
2021-04-28 22:29,Best pieces I've ever seen in the Times. So important to let the world know the chain of events to get that jab in your arm. Thank you. I'll share it with my family and send it to school.
2021-04-28 22:31,Amazing details and definitely a good read. The visuals made a huge difference.
2021-04-28 22:53,"Kudos for this piece -- and for providing crucial, detailed information on something that is so important to our society. It highlights the continued need to support the Times, and the fruits of doing so. 

Additionally, thank you to this community of readers who have added additional context, and help us to understand that these vaccines are the result of YEARS of study by I'm sure many, many individuals -- and weren't some miracle that was developed overnight."
2021-04-28 22:53,"This video brought tears to my eyes to see how hard working these scientists and engineers are!  The whole process is absolutely amazing!  Words cannot describe this miracle they are producing!  Hopefully everyone involved in the production of this vaccine knows how much their hard work, perseverance, and work ethics are visible in the work they have done to make the vaccine rollout possible!  Thank you!"
2021-04-28 22:59,This wonderful piece is indeed one of the best I've ever seen in the NYT and goes such a long ways towards helping lay people understand the incredible miracle of this new vaccine technology.  Here's hoping that as more people have exposure to it -- they will reconsider getting the help this wonderful drug can provide.
2021-04-28 22:26,I am so impressed. feel so much better you guys are the best amazing as usual WOW. Keep up the concise reporting.
2021-04-28 22:42,"Now we need to mass produce all such equipment and make it available around the world, along with the know-how to use it...

And we need to force-release all patents and know-how behind all this stuff. There's a world to save. Think WW2."
2021-04-28 23:25,"So, when is Congress going to quadruple the budgets of the National Science Foundation and the National Institutes of Health that fund most of the science in this country? Scientists are constantly struggling to procure grant funding because of limited funds these institutions can give. There has to be stable, long-term funding for scientists to come up with cures for current and future diseases.

The authors of this article deserve our gratitude for publicizing how scientists work, and how they were able to save millions of lives with their discoveries."
2021-04-28 23:40,"Thanks, NYT. Fascinating. I’m a scientist but not a biochemist and know just enough to understand the principle of how the vaccine works. But I hadn’t a clue as to how the made this stuff. So a very useful education for me.

And thanks to Pfizer for allowing us a glimpse of their process. Can only increase confidence in the vaccine."
2021-04-28 22:33,"Truly incredible.
How these people weren't awarded with every ""Person of the year"" award makes a total mockery of the award; these people-- not the CDC, not Dr. Fauci, not President Biden--are the people who will put this pandemic to an end and allow us to get back to normal."
2021-04-28 23:29,Amazing. Thank you so much. Hopefully Moderna will unclench and show something similar.
2021-04-28 22:40,"Thank you New York Times for this amazing article. These are the reason I keep my subscription. 
I’m sick and tired of the opinion section."
2021-04-28 23:48,"Another amazing example how The Times uses their engaging multimedia reports to help readers understand and consume information better and fosters lifelong learning.   I feel every day I am learning something new, and learning the facts beyond the noise.   Thank you!"
2021-04-29 0:17,"What an absolutely remarkable article. Can't recall anything in my recent memory from the NYT that was this relevant, educational, and timely. Hats off to all the NYT staff, writers, editors who put this together. You have set the bar delightfully high for reporting integrity!"
2021-04-28 23:49,Thank you for such a detailed report on how the vaccine is made.
2021-04-29 0:35,Fascinating. We are so fortunate to have these scientists and lab techs. And hats off to the brilliant woman who toiled for years to develop the mRNA technology.
2021-04-29 0:36,"Oh man, what an incredible article!  I'm saving this to the Notes app on my iPhone, so I can refer to it as needed.  Great job!"
2021-04-29 1:02,"Pfizer, and other COVID vaccine manufacturers have benefitted from public funds. They should be rewarded only for the manufacturing process, but these vaccines should be public goods not subject to property rights."
2021-04-29 1:00,"This is a German vaccine through and through. China also patented this exact vaccine with BioNTech under Fosun Pharma, should the world it also refer to this as a Chinese vaccine? 

Please give credits to the BioNTech (Uğur Şahin, Özlem Türeci) and other international collaborators where it is due. This is quite misleading."
2021-04-29 1:52,"As remarkable as it is to see the immense dedication to effectiveness, safety, and speed on the part of the manufacturers, it's also distressing that many in the public are so suspicious as to resolutely reject the possibility of being vaccinated. Hopefully the transparency of the process will lead to some of them reevaluating their stance, if not for their own protection, than for that of their communities."
2021-04-28 23:17,Imagine the suicidal greed it takes to not share this protocol with the rest of the world.
2021-04-23 17:19,It seems leaders in many places wish to prove and prove again that crowds and interactions fuel the cases.  There is abundant evidence and it is simple ignored by leaders and the public.
2021-04-23 17:35,"Oxygen production and capacity, like PPE, was something that most governments never gave any thought to prior to the breakout of the pandemic last year.  The system worked but, as we have seen, there was no surge capacity for an emergency.  

While it is hard to foresee every potential problem, we do have some very good emergency planners and I have no doubt that somewhere, someone predicted this.  Unfortunately, it is very difficult and costly to be prepared for every eventuality.  That said, going forward we need to pay more attention to the recommendations of our emergency planners and allocate resources accordingly."
2021-04-23 17:23,"India is both the beneficiary and victim of it's ethnic sectarian diverse huge population.

India's military- industrial complex is focused on Pakistan.

India is the most populous Hindu nation.

India is the most populous democratic parliamentary republic.

India is the sectarian origin of Buddhism, Hinduism,Jainism and Sikhism."
2021-04-23 17:31,"Several days back when the daily-positive cases were already over 250000, Modi held an election rally and cheerfully bragged, with a big smile on his face, about the size of the crowd (there were tens of thousands of unmasked people in a stadium). 
Populists, anywhere we go, use religion for dividing people, brag about crowd sizes, falsely claim grand successes in the face of abysmal failures, hate free media, and try to kill democracies. Among the worst of such leaders, Modi is at the top, even above Trump and Bolsonaro."
2021-04-23 17:03,Modi missing his friend Trump is replaying Trump's greatest hits. Mask-less election rallies - check. Claiming the virus is going away - check. Taking credit for vaccines - check. Playing favorites while distributing oxygen and vaccines - check. Denying taking any and all responsibility - check.
2021-04-23 17:32,Complete failure on the part of Modi’s government to show leadership.
2021-04-23 17:33,"In a pandemic, leadership at every level is vital. We can see the striking contrast here in the US with Biden and Trump. President Biden surrounded himself with smart advisors and he listens to them. Modi like Trump thinks he knows it all. He never seeks advise nor has he surrounded himself with smart advisors. I hope he realizes his folly and makes amendments. India now needs a Biden."
2021-04-23 17:22,"If we were waiting for the 3rd world war, this is it. The casualty is astounding; the confusion is pervasive.

The world's super powers with advanced technologies are called upon to put there advancements for the redemption of the human race. The application of their wealth toward the development of advanced weaponry should now be redirected toward development of cure for the dying masses of various nations.

The United States, Russia, China and the EU must re-train their technologies toward the greater good of human race before it is too late."
2021-04-23 17:34,This is incredibly sad. The US and EU need to step out and donate more of their surplus covid vaccines to poorer countries like India which are suffering. My grandfather got his vaccine last week but it was too late. He likely had already contracted the virus. He's currently in the hospital on a ventilator. Please pray for him.
2021-04-23 17:28,"It is unfathomable why leaders such as Modi, Bolsonaro and Trump, among others, have felt the need to downplay the virus. There is a reasonable debate to be had about the ability of middle-income and poor countries to lock down for significant periods without creating conditions for the spread of hunger (see another article about the latter in today's Times). But simply pretending the virus is not present when it is, and downplaying its dangers, is criminal, and hopefully one day these leaders will pay the harsh price they deserve."
2021-04-23 17:28,"India is half a world away and a developing country, by many metrics. Its is being devastated by the current system. But let's not forget that for the past year, we have seen similar situations play out in the Unite States - New York City and the entire urban northeast - Spring 2020, Michigan - Spring 2020, California - Summer 2020, and then much worse - winter 2020/21. Florida, Texas, Arizona, the rural midwest, I could go on. We seem to be on firmer footing now (I hope that lasts!). It is time to be humanitarian. Let us remember what last year felt like, count our blessings that we enough vaccine to go around, and then share the surplus. If India (and other developing countries) have high infection rates, it's only a matter of time before new variants come home to roost.
 Mr. Biden and Ms. Harris, release the 20 million doses of AstraZeneca vaccine! No more stockpiling! Get the doses into arms!"
2021-04-23 17:26,Scientists make oxygen on Mars but the people of India is short of it ?
2021-04-23 17:35,"The level of callousness of the policy makers is just stunning. Instead of advising against mass gathering the leaders are busy conducting mass political rallies. There is no plan on the ground, the ineptitude is baffling"
2021-04-23 17:51,"We are also running short of test kits in several places (Mumbai, our crown jewel has a backlog of 7 days on testing for example) and the actual numbers are likely much, much higher. Only symptomatic patients are getting tested for the most part (as they are the priority) and the healthcare infrastructure in several cities are about to collapse completely."
2021-04-23 18:16,"Unfortunately, this is not the fully story. Data is being suppressed. In UP - cremation numbers and official dead count do not tally and are off by a many factors. Gujarat information is not being readily shared. What I hear from ground (corroborated with few journalist stories, social media) is that fewer tests are being administered and instructions to provide negative results. The test positivity is extremely high pointing higher numbers."
2021-04-23 17:48,"Vaccination rates for India would have been helpful context for this article. Yes, I have been wondering if the holidays would lead to a spike in the country, but missed all the political rallies contributing as well. I could understand the rationale to open up to enable people to gather for important holidays, if a signification portion of the population had be vaccinated, but if many remain unprotected, these large gatherings were foolish. 

Its a terrible tragedy. Though ""a world away"", it does hit home given the number of large global corporations with a significant portion of their technology employees based in India. In a world of widespread globalization of the workforce, people in ""far flung locales"" have become colleagues and friends."
2021-04-23 18:05,Is there no way the U.S. can help them by providing oxygen or other supplies?
2021-04-23 18:24,"The colossal failure of the Modi Government is it's own making. When the world was preparing for the second wave, India was celebrating and taking a victory lap from it's first wave. There were enough warnings, data was pointing towards a big second wave but Modi and his officials were busy in election rallies and encouraging people to go on with their lives including gathering for big religious festivals. I wouldn't compare Modi with Bolsonaro but he could have done way better only if he had gotten over his high horse and ego and paid attention to his own medical community."
2021-04-23 17:51,"Democracy on steroids - rallies, kumbh mela,  freedom of speech and expression on Trump's model, widespread non-compliance of prudent behavior such as observing the three W's by the public, related to real or feigned ignorance and lack of education, is responsible for the dire situation in India. 

It is not that scientists, both Indian and foreign, had not predicted what would happen if proper public health measures were not adopted and observed. The consequences are there for the world to see.

Non-compliance is not unique to India. There is plenty of it right here in the United States - the most advanced country on the planet. 

Gun violence. People refusing to wear masks or be vaccinated. The common factor in both India and the U.S. is the unwise and inappropriate exercise of freedom of speech and expression. There are consequences. We saw that starkly in the United States on January 6, 2021, when the Capitol was trashed by freedom fighters inspired by Trump. We are seeing that in India by the extraordinary spread of COVID-19. We also saw that in the United States - the country that holds the world record in the number of COVID-19 cases and deaths."
2021-04-23 18:12,Most of the patients are not in need of medical aid but the panic is causing stress on medical infrastructure ... daily recovery rate is near to the new case counts.
2021-04-23 18:23,"I have been thinking increasingly about the disastrous COVID experiences in countries headed by right-wing nationalists. As we saw last year with Trump, the incompetence of leaders like Modi, Bolsonaro, and Putin — despite rosy government statistics, no one inside or outside Russia believes them — results in hundreds of thousands of excess deaths and extreme suffering, hunger, deprivation and insecurity for ordinary citizens. Obvious political stunts (e.g. political rallies that ignore health warnings about large gatherings, or military exercises that attempt to deflect attention from domestic problems) aimed at bolstering flagging support only go so far to contain discontent. There will be a day of reckoning, sooner for some than others, but eventually all will be seen by the historical record as failed leaders who placed their own well being above that of their people."
2021-04-23 17:36,"The social structure of unity, benevolence and resilience is massively eroding in country like India, people have become utterly selfish, arrogant and desperate. In every level of society say it government, politics, academics, culture, people have become shamelessly selfish and non caring. In such an environment, it is inevitable that Covid which requires a lot of self and community care and effort to defeat, will rampantly rout through."
2021-04-23 17:58,"This is truly shocking. What a tragedy. Mr Modi, the Trump of India, was busy as late as last week trying to win favors with neighboring countries by promising them millions of vaccines...In his failed “vaccine diplomacy,” he compromised his country.

2021-04-23 18:23,"The so-called ""Populists"" - Trump, Modi, and Bolsonaro - presided over some of the worst, most ineffective responses to the Covid Pandemic. It was Science vs. Idiocy and the latter won in these three cases, and politicized the pandemic to their advantage wherever possible."
2021-04-23 18:27,"The two things that surprise me most are: (1) India did not suffer a huge covid wave last year; and (2) The second wave spread so fast that in a blink of an eye, the country went from ten thousand cases to what is very likely one million cases -- a hundred-fold increase -- a day. 

Anyone who has lived in India knows that social distancing is impossible and that people are not particularly inclined to follow rules. Despite this, the first wave mysteriously died down. No one has any certain answers to why.

The rate at which the second wave engulfed the country is absolutely astonishing. I doubt anyone could have predicted that let alone Mr. Modi."

And the way that the supposed ""lockdowns"" are being implemented are completely counterproductive. Allowing essential shops to remain open for only 3-4 hours in the morning results in more people congregating in a smaller time window leading to more crowds and more chances of spread. 

To find this level of unpreparedness a year into the pandemic is simply unforgivable."
2021-04-23 19:14,"With more and more variants occurring in India why is the United States still allowing international flights from there?  

Have we not learned our lesson?  We are putting our hard won progress at risk.

Our somewhat successful vaccine rollout has given us the arrogance that it will protect us from any and all variants from now into the distant future.

It is risky to bet we can vaccinate with variant boosters faster than the variants show up."

While there certainly may be reasons the data is not accurate, as shown today, the average number of cases per 100,000 over the past seven days is only slightly higher for India than it is for the U.S. And when looking at deaths per 100,000 over the past seven days, India is actually lower than the U.S. And both countries are far below the worst performing countries.

The UK, Canada, and Israel have been far ahead of the curve including quickly moving to a first dose first policies. Trump and Modi are politicians, the latter utterly negligent.

2021-04-23 18:58,"Monday morning quarterbacking is back.  Last year when COVID was raging in west and there was lock-down in India, media ripped the PM.  When India came out with minimal casualty for the country of that size and lesser infra-structure than the west, the leadership was grudgingly acknowledged, with several theories put forward why the impact was minimal in India with a high population density. 

Now that the new variant did not behave the way the original variant behaved has the western media ripping Mr. Modi.  Give me a break, CDC and FDA could not with their technical and financial arsenal at disposal could pin down the impact in the US.  The 3 vaccines in the US are technically not approved drugs - emergency use authorization only.  What are the bureaucrats doing with all the data gathered to give a final approval ?  Any media report on this issue?
I am not a DJT fan at all but comparing DJT with Mr. Modi is ludicrous to say the least.  Yes, I agree the election rallies should not have occurred, but folks in India were tired of the lock down and were impacted economically.  Furthermore, when vaccines were made available it went begging. So, a multitude of effects have brought the current situation into play.  A complex story reduced to something minimal.  Aren't we all have become tuned to resonant frequency our ear likes to hear in this modern era of incessant drum beat?"

My good friend had to hold her dad as his body went limp from low oxygen saturation in late November. EMTs said the ER and hospital were too full and told her to get him some O2 for home, but she could not find any. She thought he was dying in her arms, because OUR system was too overloaded. By her third emergency call, they finally took him to the hospital. This was in Nevada but another friend had the same story for a neighbor here in Northern California in December. This has not just happened in other countries. Please share our challenges, too, or our health care system will not change."
2021-04-23 19:53,The enormous COVID surge in India is a threat not just to India but the whole world. Many people are not aware that India is largest manufacturer of generic drugs and vaccines in the world. A significant portion of generic drugs used by millions of Americans in their home or hospital come from India. Many critical drugs are facing shortage in India and these shortage will likely become global very soon because India will be forced to divert supplies for domestic use. To put it mildly this can become a global catastrophe and the lives of many Americans depend on the supply chain working smoothly in India!
2021-04-23 18:44,"It is not a coincidence that countries with nationalist governments have fared worse in the pandemic.  That includes the United States under Trump, Brazil under Bolsonnaro, the Philippines under Duterte, and India under Modi.

Moreover, as evident during the pandemic, they are totally incapable of providing good and competent governance."

We shall overcome this hurdle as well and be a stronger and self reliant country"

Otherwise a humanitarian disaster of epic proportions awaits this poor country.

2021-04-23 20:47,"India's death rate is 7-8 per 1000. with a 1.2 B populations, that's about 9.6M deaths a year. If everyone gets infected, and 20% are symptomatic, and 2% of those people die, we're looking at 4.8M deaths. There is some overlap - but we're looking at a 50% increase in deaths.

But the situation seems to be even worse than that - and clearly things are underreported. Talking to family - There are multiple sick people from every single cousin's family in india. 

In addition, we're also hearing that 10% of microsoft employees are down with covid and 30% of employees are either sick themselves, or have someone in their direct family that are sick.

If that is a good statistical approximation, we're looking at 30% of the population sick now - and if 2% of them die - we're looking at 4.5M deaths in the next several weeks. 

Not only O2 is in short supply - but also meds like Remedevsir...Given that we've had close to 600K deaths in the US, 6M deaths in india is not out of the realm of possibility - this mostly due to 1.2B being Indias population."
2021-04-23 20:43,"The record surge in Covid cases in India is probably due to a double mutant. Genome sequencing indicates the variant as a possible culprit. 
  The average prevalence of the variant surged to as high as 52% of samples sequenced in April from almost nothing in January, according to website tracker outbreak.info, which uses data from global repository GISAID.
  The new variant, called B.1.617, was initially detected in India with two mutations – the E484Q and L452R. It was first reported late last year by a scientist in India.
   India’s health ministry first acknowledged the presence of a “double mutant” at the end of March but has downplayed it since. While it’s a variant of interest, it “has not been stamped as a ‘variant of concern’ so as to say that it is more lethal or more infectious.
  The B.1.617 variant has all the hallmarks of a very dangerous virus,” William A. Haseltine, a former professor at Harvard Medical School wrote in Forbes on April 12. “We must do all that is possible to identify its spread and to contain it.
 Of course, non-compliance with physical distancing, mask-wearing, and other public health measures may also have contributed to the current surge."

It's shelf-stable, can be mass produced quickly, it's cheaper than injectables, there's no effect on the environment since there are no needles and other accessories involved, and there's no need for medical supervision. Clinical trials indicate it offers mucosal immunity, protecting against variants and providing immunity for years. Phase 1 showed it's safe and they are going into Phase 2. For the sake of humanity, the US govt. should get behind it but Big Pharma doesn't want to lose billions in revenue when the injectables go by the wayside. It's the Holy Grail and can stop COVID in it's tracks but Dr. Fauci and others do not consider it because they are in bed with Big Pharma.

2021-04-23 20:31,"Excessive pride leads to a rather steep fall. Instead of capitalizing on the lower incidence of covid last year and continuing to be cautious in the face of more information regarding successive waves of the disease, the government decided it had, had enough of covid. Shockingly with all the death and mayhem, we still have relatives who strongly and blindly support Modi. The resemblance to Trump supporters is uncanny. Science has been replaced with mumbo-jumbo nonsense on WhatsApp. 

With the sheer number of billionaires in India and a rich corrupt government, there is enough money to procure supplies to make vaccines for everyone in India. Perhaps the Indian rich folks need to ask themselves this question, if you kill off the work force of India, who will be there to work in your companies, in your houses, in the shops and restaurants? Perhaps the time to open your wallets to your fellow citizens is now."

Why has there been no mention anywhere in the media about the West punishing China for unleashing a pandemic that has now killed more than three million people, and will no doubt continue to kill many more in countries that don't have the resources to get it under control?
If the word ""punish"" is unacceptable in political and international relations circles, then use a term that's less pejorative but has essentially the same meaning and effect.
I realise that our economies are intertwined with China's that extricating ourselves from our dependence on Chinese manufacturing will be extremely difficult but isn't there something we can do?
In England, per the government, anyone can pick up two free rapid lateral flow tests each week for home use.  And where are these tests manufactured?  I'll give you one guess.  Why?"

2021-04-24 14:48,"I'm wondering why oxygen concentrators aren't in use.  I mean the type that go with CPAP machines and merely increase the concentration of oxygen from the surrounding air.  I guess if you have 50 of them running in one hospital, it might not work too well, but in a person's home, since the hospitals are overwhelmed anyway, it might be better than letting people die without anything.  Poverty might be a factor I guess.  In the US, a second hand CPAP (not strictly legal, but often available) costs around $500, and a concentrator is around $250.  Though I noticed that new concentrators (you know the kind, the sort of thing that ""oxygen bars"" use) have gone up in price. Probably from Americans buying them and sending them to loved ones abroad.  

In a moment like this, I'm less concerned about being fined for buying a CPAP than watching my loved ones die helplessly.  Anyone know why this option is not even mentioned in the news ever? To me, red tape seems less important than someone's life."
2021-04-23 11:02,"Very interesting, however, what are the implications from a demographic point of view? What are the implications if the overwhelming segment of the population who died are the over 65 year olds?

I am looking forward to more detailed and nuanced analyses of the mortality data."

What are the demographics of those who died?  How many families were affected by deaths?  What impacts have health effects other than death already had, and are those impacts persisting?  Are lifestyle changes we made in response to the pandemic and the deaths it caused going to become permanent, or at least alter how we organize and conduct business and economic activity in the future?

The fact remains that many of those killed by COVID had a high probability of dying in 2020 had there been no pandemic. In fact 85% of everyone who died last year falls into that category.

2021-04-23 10:53,"I would guess that part of the reason so many Americans can’t wrap their heads around how substantial a threat Corona has been is Americans’ math skills are woefully lacking.  After quite a few fruitless arguments on Facebook about Covid with relatives and friends, I realized they just didn’t understand what “exponential growth” actually was, nor could some even handle simple percentages.  People have a tough time visualizing a threat if they don’t understand the quantitative data or probability behind the threat, and all too frequently people just dismiss what they can’t understand."

In that chart what is the base that the death rate as a percentage of deviation is being measured against? Is it a changing number the further out you go in time? The second chart it is clear that the measure is deaths per 100,000."
2021-04-23 11:38,"I always mention excess mortality as one of the best ways to see the impact of COVID-19 or any other phenomenon. I hadn't seen a graph of the whole century and was interested to note the drop in mortality in 1919 that was even more pronounced (appears near 14%) than the increase in 1918 (about 11%). Since US combat casualties in WWI were about 53,000 the 1918 peak and subsequent decline cant all be due to the cessation of hostilities. Wonder if we'll see a similar drop in excess mortality next year? Appreciate hearing epidemiologists' take on 1918-19."
2021-04-23 11:53,"The lives cut short is one tragedy but the lost skills of people will have a lasting impact.  As one who is 75, the lost lives of the elderly matters to family and friends.  But I grieve most for people in their productive years who were supporting families and loved ones. Think of the children who lost parents and whose very future is in jeopardy.  Our leaders cavalier attitude towards the pandemic borders on criminals negligence. We must remind them of there culpability for the rest of their lives."
2021-04-23 11:38,Even when this kind of data was not yet available most Americans — with the exception of Trumpsters— somehow sensed the state of emergency taking place in the US. They also realized Donald Trump was not the person who could aptly guide the nation out of its crisis. That’s why Joe Biden was elected. He won not because of voter fraud or other election irregularities. He won because Trump showed no compassion or even attention to the plight of Americans during a deadly pandemic. Now the numbers show the intuition of the American people was right. A tragedy was unfolding and the wrong man was in place to manage it. His presidency was deadly in so many ways. And the data proves it.
2021-04-23 11:53,"Why no mention of the historical decrease in deaths after years above average.  One would expect to see fewer deaths post-covid, too.  So its not really more/less deaths, just a short-term shift of 1-2 years .  Everyone will die, just a matter of when."
2021-04-23 11:47,"Thanks for this article. This was overdue. Unfortunately, it is hard to get the data. I myself can find excess death rate date only until February 2021 and it was in steep decline. In Switzerland for example, which has an excellent national Buereau of statistics (the US CDC obviously is still vastly underfunded ), these data are all public and constantly updated. There, one has a a rather strong negative death excess rate for 65 year old and older. The data also show that during the entire crisis, the excess death rate of 0-65 old was always normal.  If one interpolates the data from the US, it indicates that also here, since march, we must have a negative excess rate here (It would be nice to have this confirmed and also published). The graphics shown in this current NYT article show excess death rates of 12 percent in 2018 and 16 percent in 2021. Of course, such times are hard but the data also show that things balance out overall. On an other note, I got my vaccine yesterday and was impressed about the perfect organisation of this complex operation (Boston). Also this boosts confidence and hope to get soon back to normal."
2021-04-23 11:14,Data mining can solve the riddle of under reporting Covid deaths in Florida and Texas.
2021-04-23 11:37,"Donald Trump is a mass murderer who knew in January, 2020, how deadly the virus was, but lied about it, then proceeded to do everything he could to persuade people to ignore safety measures that would have saved hundreds of thousands of lives.   If he had just put on a mask in January 2020, and told his supporters to do the same, we would be looking at a much lower death toll. 

Trump didn't need to shoot 560,000 people on 5th Avenue, he just persuaded his supporters to ignore safety recommendations, and that did the killing for him.   He should be imprisoned for it."
2021-04-23 10:32,"Keep taking derivatives in the data until something really pops out, then write a story about it.

Curious if 2022 will be like 1919, and show a sharp dip in deaths."
2021-04-23 10:37,"So, for everyone that said the Coronavirus was just a bad flu, the fact that nearly every other cause of death went way down, but the total deaths went way up, shows that the pandemic was very real.  Please, look at these graphs and learn what the data shows. Politics and confirmation bias may say that Covid was a hoax, but the numbers tell a very different story. Don't let narratives and politics determine individual perspective. Let facts and independent corroboration be your guide. The hoax myth disrespects all the victims and their families' grief. It is simply a use of cruel, lying politics that diminishes anyone that proclaims it."
2021-04-23 12:04,"All  NYT reporters, and all the readers who trust the NYT  statical presentations should read a wonderful book, How to Lie With Statistics. The chart on percentage excess deaths is completely misleading. Isn’t it embarrassing for the NYT to present that chart as if it provided important information?<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/How_to_Lie_with_Statistics"" target=""_blank"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/How_to_Lie_with_Statistics</a>"
2021-04-23 11:05,"While the 2020 death rate certainly stands out due to Covid, this article written a year or so from now may indicate one of the sharpest declines year over year as a significant number of the covid deaths were folks over 65 with additional morbidities. (i.e. they died a year or too earlier). See 1919/20 rate decline as an example and post WW2.  Lazy reporting IMO."
2021-04-23 12:02,"Look at the huge decline in deaths immediately after 1918 (not mentioned in the article). What this implies is that a Pandemic (like a forest fire) roars through a society and kills (unfortunately but inevitably) the most vulnerable. Then, after that, death rates decline precipitously as well. This implies that it may be true that Covid, while increasing deaths, also essentially hastened deaths - killing people who were likely to die soon anyway. The societal response to Covid - full out panic for ALL groups - is irrational and in so many ways the ""cure"" has done little to abate the disease and much to make society poorer, more racially divided, and weaker."
2021-04-23 12:10,"It amazing that overall, the death rate was still under 1%, according to the Percentage chart, although the Total Deaths chart seems to show about 3.3 million deaths, which would be about 1%.    In any case, considering that everyone must die eventually, a rate of 1% or less is very low.     Of course, as a greater percent of the population gets to be over 65, the death rate is bound to rise eventually.   The demographers are predicting that 22 percent of the US population will be over 65 by 2050, compared to 16.5 percent now, so the death rate may resume its upward trend.  
Of those who died this year of Covid, fewer than 5% were under 50,  so the bulk of those who died were no longer in the workforce.   However, many of those who suffered long Covid and had trouble resuming normal life were under 50, and that is probably the chief drag on the economy."
2021-04-23 12:45,"So, just what are we to conclude from all this data/analysis?  Depending on which direction you look at it from, 2020 was much worse than 1918 (larger PERCENTAGE INCREASE of actual deaths above expected), about the same as 1918 (roughly the same ABSOLUTE NUMBER of deaths above expected), or better than 1918 (a smaller PERCENTAGE OF DEATHS above expected).

Our population and living conditions are much different now than in 1918 – is the comparison meaningful? We are older, and a larger portion of our elderly are in group living situations (nursing homes, assisted living), facilitating spread of the virus among the most vulnerable. We are also more concentrated in urban areas and are more mobile than we were in 1918 – both contributing to easier spread of the virus.

It’s always kind of interesting to sift through data like this, but I’m left wondering, what was the point?"
2021-04-23 13:51,"Nice analysis, but the first diagram is misleading. First, By calculating the expected rates based on the five previous years only, the year after a sudden increase in death rate will automatically show a large decrease. This is an artifact of the calculation method. A better approach would be to calculate the expected rate based on a long term non-linear trend line. Second, instead of (or better, in addition to) a graph showing the excess death rate percentage changes, a graph showing the percentage point changes should be presented. Only showing what is in effect the first derivative of the data of interest (the death rate) amplifies the effect size—for fairness sake, the reader should be able to see the original data."
2021-04-23 14:27,"I agree with some of the comments that the data is presented in a rather misleading way.   This struck me when I got to the 3rd chart which reset my mental model up till then based on the first chart which had been ""wow,  COVID-19 has actually had a bigger impact on the death rate than the Spanish Flu"" which surprised me,  given I have read a good book on that topic and realize just how bad things were.   I realize I was sloppy in my interpretation of the data but I think the first chart is legitimately misleading.   I'm still puzzled over how it manages to make  the impact of COVID-19 look worse than the Spanish flu.   The final chart shows the year before the Spanish flu there were about 1 million deaths and the year later (1918) there were about 1.4 million.  The expected death rate for 1918 should have been climbing very slowly due to population growth but should been around 1.05 million or so.   Thus about 33% more deaths than expected.   For COVID-19 we see about 15.9% more deaths than expected in 2020.   This seems like the 'bottom line' for 2020 (and I claim presenting differences in derivatives is misleading). To be fair COVID deaths have continued in 2021 whereas the Spanish flu looks like largely a 1 year event.   That seems like a reasonable point to emphasize here."
2021-04-23 15:18,"Bad as this is, it is nowhere near the tragedy that 1918 was.  That pandemic hit the young, costing them their entire lives.  This one mostly hit the old, and while it is sad many may have lost some months or years they could have had, they still had a lot of life behind them.

The greater tragedy is that the life expectancy of those born after 1957 or so has been falling for years -- perhaps decades -- due to diminished economic circumstances, public policies that disadvantage them, family breakdown.  With rising suicide as a major cause -- dating back to the late 1970s and early 1980s.

Since the young don't die in large numbers, the diminished circumstances of later born generations was obscured by the the affluence of well being of those currently age 62 and over, and their lower death rate and rising life expectancy.  Obviously COVID-19 adds additional deaths by the old to the rising pre-mature deaths by those born later."
2021-04-23 12:09,"The 1918-1919 pandemic killed 1 out of every 150 Americans, or 6500 for every million people.  That is well over three times as many, per capita, as Covid-19, which is about 1 person for every 580 Americans, or about 1720 for every million.

It is misleading to say ""Covid-19 had killed as many people as the 1918-19 flu,"" since the country has well over three times as many people today.   Furthermore, having a graph showing total deaths is pretty worthless when, as you say, ""Data before 1933 do not include all states""!    

It's true, I had not taken into account (as I have watched this) the fact that the normal per capita death rate is today half what it was in 1918, i.e. that life expectancies have nearly doubled in the last century."
2021-04-23 15:14,"It's important to remember that these Covid deaths were with social distancing. Without it, and with all those patients surging into the hospitals at once, the toll would have been higher, and quite likely in the millions.

Considering our medical advances since 1918, including better PPE for medical staff (shortages notwithstanding), the Covid virus was -- and continues to be -- a serious one. I hope that will be remembered as we begin to recover. 

Already, comments about ""whether we really needed to close at all"" continue to depress me."
2021-04-23 14:14,"""Yeah, well, I still don't believe it's been that bad.""

- Large percentage of the population who no longer believe anything they simply choose not to believe."
2021-04-23 15:02,"Denise Lu is a skilled graphic editor....and probably could have come up with a better way to present the data that headlines the web page. As many have noted, the chart is misleading - it ""highlights"" the rate of Covid and makes it appear worse than 1918 flu. Yet it also shows the declined rate in 1919 (which was interesting, and something I didn't realize). 

Overall - takeaway is that societal/US death rate is MUCH lower now due to medical advances, sanitation, etc. It will be interesting to see if the overall death rate averages out over the next few years. It's only an ""increase"" in deaths over time if there isn't a drop in the next couple of years. Wonder what the ""7 year rolling average"" would tell us.

Enjoy"
2021-04-23 12:40,"The excess death directly due to covid shows only part of the toll.  

What is also striking is the huge jump of deaths due to “other causes” in  2020 vis a vis previous years as shown in that last chart on leading causes of deaths. The interpretation of this number (Which seems to be about 18-20%) is the key to understanding the true toll of Covid. 

We already know it is not an increase in suicide as the NYT reported this past week (suicide actually declined last year) so we can safely assume that it is in fact even unreported Covid death and/or death of those who couldn’t access regular care because of the toll on the health system. 

And by the way the over mortality in 2020 is a word wide phenomenon. Still people out these claiming that covid is just another flu like disease?
(The answer is yes sadly as we know). 

NYT keep up the good work!"
2021-04-23 14:22,"When the ACA was being debated, Republicans decried the supposed death panels. Others call themselves pro-lifers. As we can see, when given the chance to save lives in the face of a *real* threat, they have no real interest. The levers of power were available to them, but they failed in their duty, and in a chance to live up to their claimed values."
2021-04-23 14:32,"What I find interesting is how a century of progress is reflected in our reaction to this plague being a smaller rate of death, and being able to survive a lockdown economically, although with extremely sever second order effects as a result of the lockdown.

We owe all of this to the work of those who went before us, whom we now turn up our noses at.  But we are only human, and perhaps will benefit those who come after us, despite our worst instincts."
2021-04-23 12:38,"My first reaction to the top chart was ""Wow, deaths went up by almost 15%.""  A slightly more in depth read shows that actual deaths were 1% higher than normal. (Normal death rate = .08%, multply by .15  = 1.2%)  I'm not saying the increase is insignificant, mearly that this chart seems to intentionally overstate the impact of Covid."
2021-04-23 12:44,"Covid 19 was the third leading cause of death in 2020.  Number one was heart disease, which is largely preventable and treatable (second is cancer, which depending on the type is treatable if you have access to healthcare).  In a country where Democrat and Republican politicians are perfectly fine leaving 31 million people uninsured, and where there is almost no discussion of the correlation between bad Covid 19 outcomes and bad health (and how to mitigate risk in that regard) I find the current narrative to be quite disingenuous."
2021-04-23 13:01,"I find it disturbing how many of the comments here view the data as supporting their claim that COVID has been exaggerated, and that the public health measures in response have been irrational.    Particularly galling is the notion that COVID is less serious because most fatalities are people likely to die soon anyway, from their pre-existing conditions--being sick or old.   Or, that COVID disproportionately affected people not in the workforce, so all the public health measures affecting the entire society were an unwarranted drag on the economy.   Good grief.  Surely I'm not the only one who reads stuff like that and thinks:  how  are such views morally defensible?  If those views are truly widespread, I'm glad I'm in the category of the dispensable ""old"" and won't be around for this descent into Lord of the Flies."
2021-04-23 13:51,"Looking at the last graph, both heart disease and cancer is down a total of 5% from previous years.  Is it reasonable to infer that 5% of covid deaths occured in people who would have likely died this year from cancer or heart disease?"
2021-04-23 14:07,"This article should be reworked to be better understood.

It is unclear to me if the top chart of ""Death rate above and below normal..."" is based solely on % change vs. just prior year OR the normalized prior 5 year regression referred to in methodology footnote.  If the latter then a short blurb immediately below the chart itself with a footnote to a fuller methodological description would have been helpful, perhaps even including a short tutorial on what a linear regression is and why.

More importantly what's not stated is how trend data derived from the years prior to 1933 that had been missing some states ?  

Also how were the additions of Alaska and Hawaii handled?  

Does the data include deaths both overseas and stateside attributable to WWI, WWII, Korean War, etc.

If the charts are presenting changes derived from prior 5 year regression model then I would expected the ""Total Deaths"" chart to have also included 1905-1909 which would have been required to show values starting in 1910.

Lastly in percentage shares of ""Leading causes of deaths..."" it's unclear to what extent the reduced share of deaths recorded as due to Heart disease and Cancer are actual reduced numbers or a function of the increased number of overall deaths?

Clearly based on comments and other anecdotal stories many believe that Covid deaths are often being mischaracterized as individuals who were already likely to die from from heart disease, cancer or some other illness."
2021-04-23 14:47,"Two notes:

First, this admirable summary looks only at deaths — yet millions are living with long Covid, which, beyond its obvious current symptoms, may be a novel time bomb within the human body. We just don’t know yet, 

Second, most of those who have died of Covid have left behind people who grieve for their loss. A recent NYT article placed that number at nine — nine people experiencing grief per Covid loss. I suggest that, in many cases, factoring in those who knew the person in non-family contexts, that number is higher. 

The losses due to Covid extend past deaths."
2021-04-23 14:39,"So the U.S. death rate was higher than it was during the Covid-19 pandemic for the entirety of U.S. history up until around the year 2000.  Somehow we managed to get through those dark decades (remember the terrible 1990s?), when people died of communicable diseases, without shutting down society and closing schools."
2021-04-23 15:00,"I wonder how many deaths did heart disease and cancer get cheated out of by Covid.  Also, is it possible that assuming we reduce Covid deaths down to a small number in 2021 that we could actually see a negative excess rate in 2022?  We all die someday, so Covid is merely pulling deaths forward in time, and reducing the number of deaths for other causes.

This would also appear that we are doing a better job of fighting heart disease, cancer and diabetes than what is really the case, wouldn’t it?"
2021-04-23 13:47,"This article is a classic example of why finding a percentage that makes the graph look striking is lying with statistics.  The percentage of the population killed by the 1918 flu was far higher than that killed by Covid -- more than 3 times higher. And your graph minimizes that and makes the Covid spike stand out. You've had quite a few other articles in which you've employed these deceptive percentage graphs, for support of quite a few of your other causes.  You should get a new stats person or resume having an ombudsman."
2021-04-23 15:23,"Very good and interesting data presented in a very misleading way with an attention grabbing headline. Comparing rates of increase of rates? Please. That is a specialist number to be interpreted with nuance not shown. Basically it means that our progress in mortality rate reduction makes Covid-19 stand out more, despite being significantly less impactful than the 1918 flu pandemic. 

Covid-19 is devastating enough as it is without trying to cook up ways to make it sound worse for sensational headlines.  But I suppose newspaper folk will try to sell newspapers."

2021-04-23 14:30,"I take little solace in the fact that between June last year and the last day of the Trump “administration”, the death toll in Trump-supporting states was way higher than in states with Democratic leadership.

The worst Trump states had around 400% the death rates of the most Democratic states.  On average, Trump supporting states had a per capita death toll 31.4% higher than non-Trump supporting states.

Name one Republican “leader” who has recognized and apologized for this appalling result of Trump gaslighting his own people.

And for those who'd then argue, well, we still have some out there who think it's all a hoax, or exaggerated, I'd retort that, if some think that way,  over a year in, they're not going to suddenly change their POV because of a bubble chart, or a  graph, or an interactive whatever....

I look to newspapers for just that, 'news'.  Sorry but...COVID ain't news for the most part,  and certainly not stories like  this.  What about telling us what's going on in the rest of the world...any geopolitical conflicts to educate us on,  and which your average American is utterly apathetic and clueless about?

In 2020/2021, the population of the US is around 330 million, and 570,000 have died of the virus, or 0.173%. So the number of deaths in 1918 in percentage terms was almost 4 times higher. And yet the chart says that the percentage of excess deaths in 2020 was greater than in 1918.

Or, we could have chosen no shutdowns, universal masking when indoors or anytime in crowds with no shutdowns, and a complete guess as to what would happen to the illness/death rate. 

I personally favored the last approach, but the bottom line is we will never know what would have been the best approach."

He failed to ramp up PPE production fast enough, getting health workers sick and exacerbating the problem.  Worst of all, Trump politicized mask wearing, which surely was the single biggest factor responsible for many thousands of unnecessary deaths.

And oh yeah -- Trump incited an attempted insurrection so he could continue his defenestration of the United States.

These statistics and graphs are too abstract for these people - comments such as ""look at the death rate, it's going down overall!"" do not help. They need to see what's going on in the ICUs, see their neighbors who have lost family members, and have access to community role models who got the vaccine.

I had now idea it had been in such steady decline until basically now. So much so that the 2020 spike in death rate seems roughly equivalent to 2000."
2021-04-23 17:14,"A monumental difference I see between the 1918 Influenza Pandemic and the 2020 Coronavirus Pandemic is the attitude, understanding, appreciation and belief in science and scientists.  

Even though sophisticated scientific equipment had not been invented a century ago, Influenza (Flu) and COVID-19 are both contagious respiratory illnesses, but they are caused by different viruses. COVID-19 is caused by infection with a new coronavirus (called SARS-CoV-2), and flu is caused by infection with influenza viruses.

A century ago, most people trusted and believed what was told to them by health and political figures.  They followed the protocols established at the time which were considered the most effective and safe at the time.

How many millions of people STILL refuse to believe in wearing a mask, keeping social distances and amount of people they engage with.

There seems to be so much doubt, mistrust and trepidation towards government officials and science in general NOW than a century ago.  So many refuse to adhere to the simplest of requests to remain safe as well as extending that safety to others.

More people seemed to care more about others, neighbors, strangers, than what we continue to witness today.

30% of Europeans died from the 1919 pandemic.  Over 500 THOUSAND Americans have needlessly died because of misinformation, no federal direction and stupidity.

Let's get this thing behind us.  MASK UP when you're around others - even if you are vaccinated.  The virus doesn't know or care who you are, who your loved ones and friends are and how much money you have - or how stupid you are.

2021-04-23 18:09,The analysis of the death rate is interesting especially the downward trend due to modern medicine.   What I find fascinating is that no one wants to discuss that our nation has a sizable population that have underlying conditions related to our society's excessive consumption of junk food and a lack of exercise.   The pharmaceutical industry provides a cure for ailments caused the food industry's marketing of food with no nutritional value.    Both industries have no incentive for a healthy society and are complicit in the excess deaths due to covid.  The irony is how much hope we place vaccines and treatments when our society should be pushing for healthier lifestyles to combat illness.
2021-04-23 18:47,"I don't want to minimize advances in medicine, but we shouldn't give more credit to medicine than it deserves.

2021-04-23 19:48,"Does anyone have statistics on the comparative Potential Years of Life Lost (PYLL) between the 1918 Influenza Pandemic and the 2020 Covid pandemic? Based on my experience over the past year+ as an ER Physician my assumption is that these numbers are vastly different and that Covid was much less menacing per this metric, per capita, than the the classic Influenza pandemic which it is often compared to. Influenza, after all, regularly took all age groups, including infants, while Covid victims largely skewed towards the upper extremes of life expectancy. Does anyone have links to reliable statistics on this subject? I would find this an interesting contextual point to be pursued in the conversation created by this article.

From Wikipedia:
“Years of potential life lost (YPLL) or potential years of life lost (PYLL), is an estimate of the average years a person would have lived if they had not died prematurely. It is, therefore, a measure of premature mortality. As an alternative to death rates, it is a method that gives more weight to deaths that occur among younger people. An alternative is to consider the effects of both disability and premature death using disability adjusted life years.”"
2021-04-23 19:51,"I have to quibble with this statement: ""‘Excess Deaths’ in 2020 Surpassed Those of 1918 Flu Pandemic""

Not denying that it's true, but do wonder why.

The 1918 flu was at least as deadly as (most experts think *more* deadly than) Covid. 

But there are a few sources of excess deaths that are likely far greater now than during the 1918 pandemic.

1. Modern medicine now allows many people to survive other (non-pandemic illnesses) when they would've died in 1918. In The past year saw people forgoing essential medical care -- even skipping trips to the ER for things like severe chest and abdominal pain.

2. The ready availability of illicit drugs (especially opioids) is fueling a surge of ODing from social isolation and unemployment. Without these drugs, there were far fewer of these types of deaths in 1918.

3. One also needs to wonder if the suicide rate was as high then. I don't believe that 1918 saw as many school and workplace closures. And in any case, people often lived with extended family and were less likely to suffer the grinding isolation that is driving the 2020/2021 pandemic suicides.

4. This is a disease that disproportionately hits the elderly. Plus, modern medical care has allowed many of our most frail and sickly elderly to survive far far longer than they would've survived in 1918. So I'd be curious to see how much of a dip in mortality we see after the Covid pandemic. One would think there would be a bigger dip in post-Covid mortality for this reason."
2021-04-23 20:00,"If you add public health MD decisions to the mix, what's going to be interesting is when the iatrogenic percentage of 2020 excess deaths starts to emerge. Never before have so many forgone medical exams and treatment as occurred in 2020 nor in modern times have ventilators been deployed without continuous monitoring. As we sit here today, it remains a very open question what portion of 2020 excess deaths were from the medical establishment's 2020 waiver of the principle of first do no harm..."
2021-04-23 20:02,"The discussion here neglects to mention the role that the influenza death number plays in how we interpret the number of excess deaths. In the United States in 2020 the number of influenza deaths was extraordinarily low. For example, Washington State reported zero official influenza deaths. These so-to-speak missing influenza deaths should also be attributed to 2020 Covid-19 deaths. Our national annual influenza deaths range between 10,000 (a very good year) and 100,000 (a very bad one)."
2021-04-23 20:06,"Looking at the chart at the end, 2 things pop out visually (albeit not with hard numbers)

The overall increase is much bigger than the 10% attributed to COVID, and the increase in heart disease deaths was far greater than that seen in the prior years. In other words, the COVID death totals are very much undercounting the true toll the disease has taken.

We already knew this, but it is just more evidence to that fact."
2021-04-23 20:54,"While the graph showing excess deaths is compelling and clear in indicating the impact of Covid-19 on overall mortality, the table which shows cause of death is somewhat confusing and may suggest an overattribution of death to Covid.  In that table the combined cause of death due to cancer and heart disease is consistently around 44% in prior years. In 2020 it is just 39%. This suggests the possibility of over attributing 5% of total deaths to Covid-19."
2021-04-23 21:21,Sadly a lot of care at end of life is sometimes just focused  on simply keeping people alive no matter the quality of life. It’s  no surprise in the absence of hospital visits many elderly would typically go to hospital for that the death rate also rose.
2021-04-23 21:24,"I'd be interested to know the ""life expectancy"" of, say a 20 year old in 1910 or 1920, to the life expectancy of an adult now...it would seem likely that much of the increase in life expectancy would be from many fewer deaths now of infants and children, thereby skewing the numbers somewhat..."
2021-04-23 22:00,"Without trying to downplay how serious Covid is, the title is misleading. Look at the chart ""Death rate above and below normal in the US"". From that chart, clearly ""Excess Deaths"" has surpassed 1918--but it is based on a percent where the denominator is the number of deaths (I think) and as the chart ""Death rate in the US over time"" shows, clearly the death rate is falling. So what we get is a situation where the percentage is higher--not because there are more excess deaths but because it is being measured against a smaller number relative to the population.  The right way to measure excess deaths is shown in the ""death rate in the US over time"" graph. A table version where we could see the numbers is not provided but even just by looking at the graph we can see that 2020 excess deaths is still quite a bit lower than 1918 excess deaths relative to the population. [To see this compare the height of the bar in 2020 to the bar in 2019 and the bar in 1918 to 1917. Clearly the difference between 2020 and 2019 is less than the difference between 1918 and 1917.]"
2021-04-23 20:12,"Besides the about 15% excess deaths in 1918, did anybody notice the -15% excess in 1919?"
2021-04-23 17:58,"Please note I am not a Covid denier, a Trumpeter, nor do I think our pandemic is a trivial thing but fact manipulation with statistics for sensational headlines isn't good reporting.

In 1920 the US population was 106 million, a bit less than 1/3 of the current population.  So in 1918 we lost 678,000 people to the Spanish flu. In 2020-2021 a similar number. Yes, as of today it is less, but we aren't done with this pandemic yet.  So in fact the Spanish flu of 1918 was much, much worse, 3 times worse, than today's pandemic in terms of deaths per population.  Yet the entire article would have you believe it is worse today because the authors compare death rates, which by any lens is the wrong measure.  Reporting at it's worst."

Someone else said our vaccine development was the envy of the world, not our rollout, completely ignoring all the other vaccines that came out around the world at the same time and also missing how far ahead we are of Europe in getting shots in arms. The number of false facts around Covid are mind boggling. Yes we did the right thing wearing masks and closing down restaurants etc. But no, once you have been vaccinated it's time to ditch those masks and all the rest of the guidelines unless someone is planning on these rules staying in effect forever because we are never going to be done with Covid's mutations. It's nice not catching colds any more but at some point cold sober fact checking needs to be done.

They both contracted the virus and brought it home to their children who became very ill. One of the parents ended up in the hospital and ended up in ICU. After their horrendous experience thankfully they they all survived and the adults are now vaccinated. The Trump administration's failure to warn people of the dangers has led to huge tragedies in this country."
2021-04-23 19:15,"Succinct visual presentation, and informative.

We should give the effects of age adjustment on the data a brief explanation since the actual rate at which Americans die, known as the “crude death rate,” is a bit higher today than the graph shows, and for 1918 much lower than shown, due to the younger population we had in those days, with lots of children and relatively few over 65. Because the 1918-19 influenza preferentially killed young adults, adjustment to match the year 2000 population age structure will make the flu toll look lower than it really was, relative to the age structure then. Most of America’s WWI fatalities also took place in 1918, in young people; these number around 120K versus the 650K believed dead of flu. One last consideration is the split in the flu deaths, with some of them in 1919 or even 1920.

Although Covid brought a larger year-over-year percentage bump in death rates, the flu was clearly deadlier. As America had only 100 million people in 1918, Covid would have to kill 2 million to reach the same proportion. We have better nourishment, less coal smoke in our air, and hypermodern medicine to help us keep mortality down."
2021-04-23 20:25,"Comparing  the death rate of the Spanish Flu to Covid is a futile exercise. Yes, Covid may have killed more people, but the vast majority of these victims would probably not have even been alive in 1918 when life expectancy was more then 20  years lower.
The Spanish Flu killed hundreds of thousands of children and young people - it was tragedy on a completely different scale than Covid."

2021-04-23 19:48,"The comparison to the 1918 pandemic is incomplete. Almost all COVID-19 mortality models focused on number of deaths, without considering age structure and co-morbidities. This can give very misleading inferences about the burden of disease in terms of quality-adjusted life-years lost, which is far more important than simple death count. For example, the 1918 Spanish flu killed young people with a median fatality age of 28 and its burden in terms of number of quality-adjusted person-years lost was about 450-fold higher than the COVID-19 (at least as of April 1, 2021). The majority of covid fatalities are in Massachusetts were in their 80s and 90s. Vaccinating this demographic will dramatically reduce the number of covid deaths."

Data from wiki and W.H.O.'s site... a site that also seems to indicate that the USA, with 4.25% of the world's population, somehow has roughly 20% of the case and death counts. 
Worldwide numbers. 1920, Earth population at 1.8 billion. 50 million (conservative figure, some estimate 100 million) died from the 1920 pandemic. That is 1 in 36 dying (50 million) from the world population. 2020: Earth population, 7.8 billion. 3 million dead from Covid. That is 1 in 2600 people dying from Covid. Even with all the massive advancements in transportation, Covid is running at less than 1.5% of the 1920 pandemic's lethality. This, even with the levels of travel that exist now versus what travel existed in 1920; hint: there was no air transport, and on average it took about eight days to cross short routes between continents. 
2020 Covid death count would have to exceed 216 million worldwide to be in the same league as the 1920 pandemic."
2021-04-23 19:47,"This seems strange ... medical science, theraputics, and drug therapy are vastly improved from that a century ago - and why/how did we have a 5% combined drop in cancer and heart disease deaths from the rates in many prior years (we know people were delaying treatment) ... I suspect those fatals are in the covid count - along with some others."
2021-04-23 19:57,"Not to minimize Covid-19, the 1918 pandemic was worse in terms of sickness and death. The population of the U.S. in 1918 was 103.3M. The number of deaths was 675,00. To equal this rate in the U.S. today, over 2 million would die. Worldwide, in 1918, an estimated 1/3 of the population contracted the virus."
2021-04-23 21:50,Look at the death rate in 1919 following the Spanish Flu epidemic -- way below average. The logical implication is that pandemics tend to accelerate the passing of those who are near death regardless. Was it really necessary to shut down society in 2020-21 for 18+ months to temporarily prevent the deaths of those unavoidably approaching it due to simple old age?
2021-04-23 18:58,"I am struggling to see how to square the graph of total deaths over time (increase of about 40% in absolute number of deaths between 1917 and 1918) and the change in death rate between 1917 and 1918 (supposedly 12%), which as death rate is defined as deaths/100 000 population (for a population which would have been similar between 1917 and 1918) is clearly inconsistent.  
Which graph should we believe?"
2021-04-23 21:31,"I question their data.  IF you want to know how many dies and were expected to die talk to actuaries in the Life Insurance Industry, NOT the Center for Disease Control.
There was so much mis-classification over the last year because hospitals were paid more for COVID related deaths and services"
2021-04-23 19:02,"It's only further above normal thanks to how low the normal death rate has become. Still, life expectancy went down a lot more for the Spanish Flu (13 years vs. a 1 year dip for covid I read)."
2021-04-23 18:05,"These data illustrate the maxim: ""Data do not confess until  you torture them.""  Suppose that in the 1920 epidemic the population was 100 million, and the pre-epidemic death rate was 5%. Now suppose that the epidemic caused death rates to increase to 8%; this implies an increase in mortality of 60% (3/5 x 100%) . Now suppose that in contemporary America the population is 300 million and the normal death rate is 2%; when the 2020 pandemic occurs suppose that the death rate rises to 3.5%; this implies that the death rate has increase by 75% (1.5/2X100).  According to this logic the 21st century is doing worse than the 20th century because the EXCESS deaths relative to the ""normal"" death rate are higher in the 21st. This analysis ignores the growth in population.  In this example 21st century American population is 3 times greater than that of 20th century America (these are roughly similar to the true data). Again the increase in population is  300% while the number of excess deaths has increase by 50%. Additionally the author does not realize that the 21 century population is substantially older than that of the 20th century; older people are more susceptible to new disease than the young. In sum, this article is not about the failings of the American system of health care, but about the failings of the American educational system that allows a reporter for (arguably) the best newspaper in the US  to be so statistically, logically, and historically challenged."
2021-04-23 18:46,"Historians ignored the 1918 pandemic.  As a result, our politicians were unprepared to deal with the pandemic of 2019.  

Historians should learn a bit of biology and write fully and accurately about this pandemic so that future politicians will be prepared for the next one."
2021-04-23 19:46,"It is important to hold politicians to account in a democracy as were are dependant on their decisions. To an extent we judge their successes or failures by comparison to others.
When measuring the impact of policies on pandemics age adjusted excess deaths per million is a well accepted statistic, but percentage change in recent average death rates is a fair rough approximation.

16% for 2020 is a bad figure, and early 2021 was worse for the USA although statistics have improved recently (temporarily?). However the USA figure is not an outlier when compared to other rich advanced countries that provide reliable statistics; it is the raw number that overwhelms.

In article recently published by the FT, up to the end of March 2021 the USA did slightly better proportionately than Italy and Spain, slightly worse than the UK and much worse than Germany. 
However, many eastern european members of the EU have done worse than USA and their statistics are deteriorating. In addition Russia and Brazil are materially worse than the USA, but other Latin American countries that have reliable
death registers are much worse still e.g. Mexico, Peru and Ecuador."
2021-04-23 20:54,"I appreciate the statistic but it seems a little too subtle.   The clearer way to compare eras would be deaths per 1000 for 1918 v 2021.     Otherwise  even though the flu killed a higher percentage of the population in 1918, it appears less deadly than Covid because people didn’t live as long, or more infants died back then of other causes."

(Excess deaths is the way to go and the flu deaths are an estimate, but for argument’s sake...)

In order for us to beat the flu’s percentage, we’d have to have 2,151,500 deaths from Covid: x/331,000,000 = 0.0065; solve for x.

However, given continuing insanity on masking, distancing, and vaccination—even in the face of examples like the UK, Brazil, and India; even in the face of worse variants; and despite having already mistakenly believed, just ten seconds ago historically speaking, that what happened in Wuhan, Lombardy, et al can’t ever happen in God’s Chosen Country, ringed, as we all know, by a virus-repelling force field—I am quite bullish on our chances of Making America Great Again by beating the earlier pandemic’s percentage.

If the coronavirus could be transmitted to so many people, so could the flu."
2021-04-23 22:15,"Clearly, COVID-19 is the worst medical catastrophe in the past century, and worse than the 1918 flu pandemic.

It is notable that in 1919, the death rate was LOWER than expected, perhaps because the 1918 flu killed most of the older people near death.

It would be interesting to see whether a similar dip will occur for 2021.

On the contrary, I would expect that the death rate will remain elevated for several years, due to the large number of younger COVID survivors with long-haul COVID illness, which may lead to further deaths in coming years.

We’re not done with this yet, by any means."
2021-04-23 22:31,"The COVID-19 deniers do not believe that COVID-19 was the cause for the excess deaths.  They claim deaths were due to comorbidities.

That's like saying George Floyd would have died on May 25, 2020 due to his medical issues or drug use. The jury didn't buy it, the overwhelming majority of Americans didn't buy it, and it's simply not true.

Do not disrespect the 570,00 folks, their families and friends,  They passed on due to COVID-19- Deal with it!"
2021-04-23 23:26,"As a physician and epidemiologist this year has also been both a tragic experience and enormous professional challenge.   In March last year I projected that there would be 4-500 Covid deaths - unfortunately an underestimate.  Looking back with an analytic perspective, I think there are several paradoxes not fully appreciated by the general pubic.  

First, in terms of the broad sweep of events, epidemics like Covid have occurred throughout recorded history, and will continue.  Hopefully they may be a less frequent.   Second, very clear guidance on how to reduce the impact existed and had been the subject of many recent books and federal reports (but were not followed).  Third, while the general course of this epidemic could be predicted, including the fall/winter surge, many small-scale aspects (eg, why is MI is such terrible shape now?) were impossible to unravel. 

For most other epidemiologists, the inevitable massive impact - even now only reaching full force as in Brazil and India - could be seen early in March 2020.  In the US about half of deaths could have been prevented, however.   Asian countries did much better; Europe did not.  So the US was going to take a massive hit - which Trump at least doubled. 

Most troubling however - saddest of all - we have not learned the single most important lesson - the US needs a public health infrastructure.  A national institute, a many-fold larger work force, and the capacity to respond to everyday public health challenges."

2021-04-23 23:40,"This graph may open more questions than it resolves.  The severe increases of deaths in 1918 are followed by an even greater decline in death rates, unlike the spikes in death rates in 1915 and 1916. Did the pandemic of 1918 increase deaths or did it accelerate deaths that would otherwise have occurred in 1919?"
2021-04-24 0:07,"We must live in a very health beneficial part of the world up here in NE Montana and NW North Dakota.

I am president of our local Senior Citizens Center (I'm 63), and we stayed open all winter, as did our local schools.

We are open three times a week for noon meal, card games after, and monthly organizational meetings.

No masks.

Some of our members chose to stay at home and have meals delivered, but they were in the minority. 

We supported their decision, feeling from the beginning that each of us was capable of dealing with this in our own way.

In November and December we had some of our regular members (less than half) contract covid (tested positive), and all of us came through with no lasting ill effects.

In fact, we all thought it affected us no more than the normal flu. The one who suffered the most was overweight, which is also normal for the flu.


In general, I feel that many doctors were so fixated on the virus, that they neglected to treat the symptoms, and secondary infections like bacterial pneumonia.

All patients should have been prescribed anti-inflammatories, for inflammation of the lungs, and antibiotics for secondary bacterial infections.

In many cases that I know of, both of these conditions were left utterly untreated."
2021-04-24 0:27,"I can find no reason to make the denominator (deaths per year) other than it leads to a punchier headline.  The denominator should be (US population), and when you do that you find that 1918 was worse.

It makes sense to use the change in death rate to estimate the number of deaths caused by each pandemic.  But under the NYT calculation if a meteorite took out all of Florida in December 2020 we would conclude that the COVID pandemic wasn't all that bad: only a small percentage of 2020 deaths were due to the pandemic - most were due to the meteorite.

Like the 2020 pandemic, the 1918 pandemic was truly horrendous.  It made over 20,000 orphans in NY alone.  Many died in their home because they were too sick to feed themselves and no one was willing or able to enter the home.  In some towns when rumors spread that dogs could be contagious, people slaughtered their pets.  Woodrow Wilson never publicly recognized the pandemic, and the censored press largely downplayed it as well.

The COVID pandemic has been incalculably tragic - hundreds of thousands have needlessly died because of the Trump administration's anemic response.  But if we must try to compare tragedies, we should be careful that the desire for a punchy headline isn't driving that conversation."
2021-04-24 0:10,"Trump’s criminal malfeasance coupled with a Republican Party dominated and supported by self-absorbed, mean-spirited know-nothings incapable of admitting they are wrong about anything is why COVID ended up being much worse than it should have been.

2021-04-24 1:13,"'The Spanish Flu, named after the king who died, began in America.  My parents married in June 1918, and my mother caught the Flu in September, while she was expecting me.  As I was growing up, she never mentioned the above, but I remember hearing that a total of 53 million died world-wide', so told me a few months ago, an elderly friend at Versailles.

It began in America?  What was happening at that time?  WWI, and there is an account on the web of a short-order cook in an army camp here, who became very ill along with some other soldiers.  He survived.  Before he had joined the Military, he was a self-employed butcher.  (This would have to be researched further).

""The Great Influenza"" is a non-fiction study of the 1918 Flu Pandemic, and life restrictions were harsh, leading to total isolationism in some parts of the country.  Autobiographical novels also make reference to the above, and William Maxwell writes of his youth in Illinois.  In Europe, it reached the Guernsey Islands for instance, and there are probably some civilizations that vanished for ever.

There is an undercurrent that we really do not know much about this virus, and a note of appreciation to Dr. Fauci, so many others, here and around the Globe, who are pulling each other through."
2021-04-24 1:12,It appears there were a LOT of medically fragile people who didnt need much to go over the edge.
2021-04-24 1:20,"Global deaths as a percent of the global population was far greater during the Spanish flu pandemic than any pandemic in the past 100+ years. The world's population during the Spanish flu pandemic was 1.5 billion. Today global population is 7.9 billion. 

According to CDC, It is estimated that about 500 million people or one-third of the world's population became infected with the pandemic flu virus 1918-1919. The number of deaths was estimated to be at least 50 million worldwide with about 675,000 occurring in the US. The COVID deaths in the USA so far are around 553,000 which is still less than those from flu a 100 years ago. Most of the deaths due to COVID have been in densely populated cities of the USA. The deaths in the USA due to all causes in the same period of COVID deaths were 4,330,382.

I find this concept of 'excess deaths' somewhat meaningless other than to push a political narrative. From a virologist's point of view, so far the COVID pandemic has had a much less of an impact with less than 1% of the entire global population or 3 million deaths globally out of 7700 million compared to 50 million out of 1500 million. If you look at the COVID deaths, most are in older than 55 who may have on average lived an additional 5 years had COVID not made its rounds. The 1918 flu pandemic deaths were spread over all ages including those who could have lived for an additional 10+ years. 

Longevity is multi-factorial, not a birth right and not solely associated with genes."
2021-04-24 1:17,"We don’t know for certain how many people are dying “from” covid.  
People will debate if it is “with covid” or “because of” covid. 
I think my cancer survivor mother would have become very sick or died had she contracted covid; so she isolated until she had both doses of vaccine. 
 
In modern times, we have come to expect that people with serious illnesses like diabetes and cancer can still live into old age. 
Covid suddenly cut a lot of lives short. 

One of the big questions is how many people have actually contracted covid around the world.  People with no symptoms likely didn’t get tested. 
Even many people with symptoms refused to get tested and continued with their daily lives or did not have easy access to testing.   

Many outright avoided testing because they did not want to give health authourities private information that would result in contact tracing."
2021-04-24 1:24,"To me, the most relevant graph is the second one, which seems to say that the death rate this past COVID year was about what it was in 2000.

To see why, consider the following scenario. Suppose the growth rate of (real) GDP in 2022 is 0.01% and the growth rate of GDP in 2023 is 0.03%. Then, the percent change in the growth rate of GDP from 2022 to 2023 is 200%! In 2023, the economy has a massive boom! Right? No, an increase of 0.01% to 0.03% in GDP would be a nearly imperceptible increase in a barely growing economy.

For quite sometime we were given to understand that if a person loses taste and simply can’t recognise smell, then that person has COVID but it seems it’s no longer valid. Even the persons, who are asymptotic are said to be COVID-19 positive when tested. It literally means things have been complicated far too much.

America has a population of over 330 million. How many hospitals and clinics have the capacity and capability to test each and everyone even if willing to get tested  ?

India has a population of over 1.3 billion. Are Indian hospitals and clinics capable enough to test entire population ? Simply impossible to say the least.

The young have been known to squander their youth in less than useful endeavors.  The elderly can do that too, but there isn't any reason to assume that will be the case.  Yes, I am a boomer.  I am also a farmer, an artist, a performer, a grandmother and a wife and mother.  I matter."
2021-04-24 2:06,"Nature has a way of asserting periodic dominance over human hubris.  Just as volcanoes erupt unexpectedly, or, earthquakes take regions by surprise, humans have capacity for forethought and ability to minimize damage.  We’ve learned that it is not prudent to settle at the base of volcanoes that may still be active, or in the case of tectonically active regions, to erect buildings that can absorb shaking.  We didn’t, however, have the wisdom to protect ourselves from the ravages of the latest pandemic for our stupidity in electing leaders who were science deniers! Shame on the previous administration for so many lives lost needlessly."
2021-04-24 2:12,"The following are the death statistics  which give the idea of extra deaths last year.
2018 Total deaths in USA  :  2.839 Million
2019 Total deaths in USA  :  2.845 Million
2020 Total deaths in USA  :  3.358 Million"
2021-04-24 3:21,I know so many people that died last year and only one from covid. It got to the point where I didn't want to answer the phone or emails. I moved east to take care of my sick mother only to attend a funeral for my friend with ALS that died at 32 years old january 2020. Then covid struck and my uncle was in a nursing home recovering from heart surgery and died from covid in april. Then i had to move my family back west after receiving news that my sweetest mother in law had stage 4 breast cancer and only had 6 months to live. She passed in november. My young and beautiful friend and mother of 3 died of overdose in october. Then our neighbor living in our tiny house was found dead from heart attack in december. Each day it felt like someone was sick or dying. So much trauma... peace to all and always remember to be grateful if you have good health. <3
2021-04-26 16:59,Goosebumps. I will start praying now that this trip happens. God bless.
2021-04-26 16:40,How beautiful is the bond between sisters. I'm happy they got to experience Rome together one more time.
2021-04-26 16:52,Nice story. Wish her well -- hope she lives and sees Rome again!
2021-04-26 16:50,"What a beautiful story.  I hope your dream to return to Italy comes true, Ms. Maksym.  Hold onto it"
2021-04-26 17:11,I hope someone she knows in Rome can do a live FaceTime or zoom with her from her favorite places. It wouldn’t be the same as being there but it could help her to feel as if she got to return there.
2021-04-26 17:09,"Thank you for bringing us this tale. For someone newly diagnosed with cancer, it gave me the possibility of dreaming about returning to the places I have lived overseas where I had incredible experiences and grew into the man I am today. Cancer has beaten me down, but even with Covid lurking in our world, I am determined to travel again when I regain my health. #cancersurvivor"
2021-04-26 17:11,This is love. Best wishes to Lisa Maksym.
2021-04-26 17:23,"Such a lovely story. But I would not want my ashes put into the Tiber. Instead, maybe, sprinkling small amounts of them into several of the fountains, all over the city."
2021-04-26 17:34,"Very sad. 58 is too far too young for this to happen, especially during a pandemic. This is a wonderful family and I'm glad this has brought some happiness to these devoted sisters."
2021-04-26 17:31,"Such a beautiful story. A heartfelt reminder of the bond between sisters, twins and friends. She will make it back to Rome - one way or another."
2021-04-26 17:21,Such love here! Touching!
2021-04-26 17:23,I am crying! Can someone out there with a private jet make this happen?
2021-04-26 17:31,How can you not shed tears reading this love song...???
2021-04-26 17:16,I have tears in my eyes. I love this story.
2021-04-26 17:40,I was in Roma at the same time for a year. I was 27. It was a beautiful time to be there. Hold onto the happy memories and share them so your kids will make more.
2021-04-26 17:18,If there is one thing Covid taught us it is life is short and every day is precious. I think a lot of us will be adjusting our priorities regarding work and how much money and things we really need to be happy when time is is our greatest and most fleeting gift. I hope they make it to Rome.
2021-04-26 17:43,Lisa - I understand. I'm rooting for you!
2021-04-26 17:41,Rome is gorgeous; but more important than her love of Rome is the love between these two sisters.  Genuine love that only wants the best for the other person is precious and rare.  Blessings to both of them and to her children as well.
2021-04-26 17:51,"I have  friends with chronic illnesses that cannot travel and with the pandemic, friends with families who cannot travel. Here is what I have suggested to them in the past:

1) Prepare/ eat food from the area you want to go to. Get delivery from an authentic Italian/ Roman restaurant or buy key ingredients from that country (i.e. San Marzano tomatoes, pasta, cheese, etc.) and make a feast.

2) Look up Airbnb or another virtual travel website. These offer local guides that will take you on prepared or customized virtual, live tours of wherever you want.

3) For Italy specifically, there is a wonderful Youtube channel where the owner of the channel just streams videos (with ambient noise and optional text) of his travels in Italy. They are long videos of his walks and may give her an immersive experience. Look up ProWalk Tours on Youtube. Get a video projector to get them on the wall. (I am not affiliated with ProWalk in any way.)

4) Find out some specific customs of the country/ region and replicate them. For example, learn some craft techniques from the area (e.g. origami for Japan), folk dances, etc. With the virtual tour groups above, some offer virtual lessons."
2021-04-26 17:45,"In Rome history has a sometimes quixotic way of permeating life. Times blend. There's life everywhere you look in Rome: in architecture, in city planning, in the flow of the Tiber and at the bottom of that fresh brewed espresso. (Yours is special.)  I hope Ms. Maksym has her wish to return to the place she and her sister enjoyed so much together and that this important return renews her."
2021-04-26 17:43,"Wow, this story is sweeter than even the movie Roman Holiday."
2021-04-26 17:53,What a beautiful story of sisterly love and how one would go out of their way to make a dying sister’s wish somehow come true. It brought tears to my eyes.
2021-04-26 18:09,What wonderful sisters.  I hope her dream comes true.
2021-04-26 18:14,"Beautiful story.  I hope a treasure of chimes can be found by those who know the story, and recall the beauty of it for years to come."
2021-04-26 18:21,I think somebody must be cutting onions somewhere in my house....
2021-04-26 18:10,Beautiful.  Thank you
2021-04-26 17:15,"My identical twin sister is suffering from renal failure. Given this pandemic she lives a life circumscribed by the walls of our home and those of the clinic where she receives 2x weekly dialysis. This piece brought tears to my eyes. I dream of being able to share adventures with my sister again. For now, we pray for a living donor who is a match and pray for the resource to be able to do a transplant."
2021-04-26 18:31,"I understand completely.

Like many people, I sometimes say, In my next life I'm going to do so-and-so.

In my next life, I'm going to live in Rome."
2021-04-26 18:32,"Beautiful, heartbreaking story.  Italy is grand but Rome and Amalfi in particular.. oh boy.  No other places on earth have captured my heart like those two places.

I wonder: if all the travel complications could be mitigated to the extent possible (private flight, wheelchair accessible transport around Rome, extra help..) would the sisters still want to give it a try or is it better to simply let this play out with the beautiful memories projected on the wall in her home?

If it's the former, I'd jump at the chance to help through a GoFundMe or similar to make it happen.  Or maybe this story is about letting go of dreams to physically reexperience amazing moments and places and being okay with letter the memories suffice?

I dunno which it is.  But if it it's the former, just saying.."
2021-04-26 19:51,"When I was 20 I spent the most important 6 months of my life studying in Rome.  Ms Maksym is so right, you just can't believe how incredible and beautiful this city is, and how privileged you are to know it.  Whether it's getting a cornetto at 4am on the Lungotevere after a night clubbing in Testaccio, marveling at the ancient art in the Capitoline museums, or showing off your sprezzatura walking down via del Corso, Rome is magic.  I am sure she will go back to the city and Rome with gift her with it's wonderful life, because enjoying life is what Rome is best at doing."
2021-04-26 19:51,"I'm a little younger than they are and did a semester abroad in Rome around the same time they were there.  I, too, had breast cancer but with a far happier outcome.    

Thank you for the lovely story and my best to the sisters as they navigate the next few months.  

And I hope Lisa's kids go to visit Rome, the Eternal City.  Bring your mom's memories with you, make new memories and share them one day with your own children."
2021-04-26 19:09,"I can’t tell if the sisters are identical or not and I wish the article had told us, because that is a bond unlike any other. To lose your identical twin is to literally lose a part of yourself. Wishing them both peace and may the Roman dream come true."
2021-04-26 19:20,"Ciao, Bella!”"
2021-04-26 19:28,This is so sad.
2021-04-26 19:34,"Ms. Maksym, Rome is waiting to welcome you. Come back."
2021-04-26 19:47,"I am destroyed.
Can someone get this woman to Rome?
Please?
Even if it's just for a day?"
2021-04-26 19:59,"These twin sisters demonstrate the epitome of what real, selfless love is all about.

What an amazing gift to have a sibling so thoughtful and inspiring.

""Roma loves Lisa""

I love Lisa and Camille.

Thank you for sharing this poignant story about courage, love and friendship.  I will keep you both close to my heart and in my prayers."
2021-04-26 20:01,"Sorelle bellissime, I am in Rome. I came in '91 too... we must have crossed paths, zooming about on Vespas. I stayed. And I can tell you, Rome does love Lisa.
My dear friend Mujah (my adopted Roman sister) sent me this article -- and have been plotting what we can do for you. We would love to take you around, courtesy of a smartphone to all your favorite places. Please let us know. Want to get the best gelato? An aperitivo on piazza Navona? A walk around Trastevere? 
You will always be ragazze romane, citizens of this crazy, beautiful city.
Your story has touched us deeply. Please let me know if we can do anything here... and praying that you'll be able to make it back.
Un abbraccio fortissimo,
Deborah and Mujah"
2021-04-26 20:01,Beautiful sorrelli. So lovely as young girls. Such live as adults. Italy beckons us all
2021-04-26 19:09,Rome is a city of souls...when you walk in the streets you can feel them.  I totally understand the wishes and the passion expressed in this touching story.     Sending lots of love and peace to these beautiful and loving sisters.
2021-04-26 19:46,"A heartrending, beautiful story full of love and life."
2021-04-26 19:50,"This is wonderful and heartbreaking.  I completely understand the value of travel.  My younger brother was diagnosed with a rare and aggressive lymphoma in August 2020.  He is the father of three kids and never had the time and resources to travel.  

At a time when his prognosis was especially bleak, I put aside money for him to travel when he got better.  (I said I could picture him discovering Cadaqués, Spain.) He was extremely appreciative and said he had been lying at home thinking about how much of the world he'd never seen.  

Thankfully he's now in remission and he can plot where he can travel when the world opens up again.   I'm happy I was able to give him hope for the future."
2021-04-26 20:10,"Love triumpts over all obstacles.  What a heart warming story of sisters love.  
Hope their dream of seeing Italy again realiizes soon."
2021-04-26 20:10,"Maybe some kind person with a Lear Jet could make this happen for them? Heartbreaking. I, too, hope Lisa Maksym gets to return to Rome."
2021-04-26 20:11,"This story touched my heart on so many levels. My younger sister studied abroad in Rome in 1990, and she fell in love with the Eternal City. I was about the same age as Lisa Maksym when I came out to join my sister, and we traveled together for an Italian avventura. She shared her favorite places and we discovered new favorites together - an experience that ignited a lifelong passion for Italy and all things Italian. My sister and I cherish that time together and the memories we made. 

I can imagine Lisa and Camille's deep longing to revisit Rome together and share it with their children. But I can't fathom the sadness of the circumstances that are preventing them from being able to do so. My heart goes out to them - a love letter to the eternal treasure of sisterhood, and their shared passion for the eternal city."
2021-04-26 20:12,"This is so sad and so well written at the same time.

She is sending a message to many of us: Do things that are really, really important to you while you still can. As a neurologist, I saw far too many people who were going to wait until retirement to travel only to either not make it that far or to become ill shortly afterward. There are no guarantees."
2021-04-26 20:13,Got a little dusty in my office just now. Can't seem to stop wiping my eyes. Best of luck to the sisters getting back to Rome.
2021-04-26 20:22,"What a beautiful, beautiful story! To see how much love there is in this family is incredible. Thank you for sharing this story, and allowing me to cry alongside you."
2021-04-26 20:19,"As a 48 year old woman who is very close to her brothers, still travels with them, and and went into and is still in business with one of them, I can relate to this story. There is something about siblings’ love for one another that is different from other loves and irreplaceable. And yes, it’s about adventures had together, funny moments shared. This story made me cry. I feel so much love for these sisters, even though I’ve never met them. And yes, there is something so magical about Rome."
2021-04-26 20:22,"Oh if only I could send the twins and their families to Rome, somehow!!!!"
2021-04-26 21:00,Ms. Maksym - do not go gently into that good night
2021-04-26 21:11,"Oh my god. This story just destroyed me. I know they gave you just three months, but never say never. And whatever you do Lisa, don't stop living. Even if it truly is three months, you use every bit if those 90  days as best you can. Eat great food. Drink the best wine and be around your family and friends as much as possible."
2021-04-26 20:41,"What a beautiful story of love and strength. Thank you to the family and also Maria Cramer for writing such a lovely piece.As a physician, it reminds me of how much of a story is behind every person, and every Covid statistic. I read stories like this--and it makes me want to work harder.

Hooray for both sisters, and may every day be a great one."
2021-04-26 21:00,This is such a beautiful story and warms my heart as I await in pain a knee replacement. Thanks Maksyms!
2021-04-26 21:14,Wonderful story of two strong and loving women.  Thanks to both for sharing.
2021-04-26 21:06,"I also love this story and the absolutely beautiful, moving photos accompanying it."
2021-04-26 21:23,"Such a touching story, having lived in Rome we can relate to it."
2021-04-26 21:26,I have a twin sister and we will celebrate our 70th birthday on April 29. We are also travel companions and  have been all over the world together. We love Italy and the story of Lisa and Camille.  God bless you both. I know exactly how you feel about each other and about Italy.
2021-04-26 21:27,"The bond of sisters can be so wonderful, how I miss my own."
2021-04-26 21:27,"A great joy is in this story, as anyone who has fallen in love with a place or culture or geography will testify. 

And Italy has done this honor so often for so many. The joy of this Earth can only be to have lived on it, to have breathed its air, to have felt life, with others. That's all a day holds, and should hold."
2021-04-26 21:40,"That's love, pure love. God bless those beautiful sisters."
2021-04-26 21:51,"That’s amore.
Just beautiful, and so touching.
Grazie mille, thank you for sharing this story."
2021-04-26 21:46,"Loved reading this story, especially as I've been somewhat stuck in Rome during the pandemic and missing my US home. It is indeed a magical (and maddening) city. I fell in love with it 17 years ago and stayed. I hope Lisa and her family return to bella Roma. La citta eterna vi aspetta. In bocca al lupo, Lisa."
2021-04-26 21:30,I am going to watch Roman Holiday just to help the universe allow this trip to happen! Touching—
2021-04-26 22:50,"""Motorino"" is a generic term for a scooter or moped and should be ""motorino""."
2021-04-26 22:01,"So lovely.  I lost my mom to breast cancer 11 years ago, almost 20 years after her initial diagnosis.  She loved to travel (and in her 50s and 60s, finally had the means to do so).  If it was during a time she was undergoing chemo, she'd sometimes use the 1-2 week between rounds to travel (including a trip with me, her best friend and my best friend to our ancestral Ireland in 2001).  She visited Rome with her best friend and I was able to visit there (and the Amalfi Coast - stunning!) with friends a few years ago.  Reading this story really makes me want to return and it's my fervent hope that the sisters get to return, too."
2021-04-26 22:10,"Life is mean sometimes. But these women have a wonderful time together and they've experienced the bella Roma! I hope Lisa and Camille continue to hang out, have fun, drink wine and eat lots of great pasta. That trip may not be too far away."
2021-04-26 22:28,"What a heartbreaking and beautiful story! Some places leave an indelible mark on our soul, and we carry them with us wherever else we go. I'm glad these sisters had Rome, and that Rome had them."
2021-04-27 0:02,"Twenty years ago, I was diagnosed with breast cancer. My husband intuitively knew  I needed to believe  I had a future, that there would be a tomorrow. So, he (without telling me anything) planned the most amazing trip to Alaska and booked it for one year ahead. I spent that year, eagerly awaiting the day I would be on the Alaska Ferry. And the week that we would spend in Danali. And on the plane that took us to Dawson City. I was so excited about the trip, that I didn't have time to waste worrying about dying. To this day, after nearly 40 years together, it is the most precious gift he has ever bestowed on me. I wish you well. Your experience in Rome is a powerful adventure to have in your Life-Well-Lived Bank. I wish you many hours of pleasure in your Roman Holiday room."
2021-04-27 0:04,"The places to which we dream of returning.  They feel so close and it feels like only yesterday we were there.  We drank in the sunshine and swore we would be back.  It seemed a small promise when we made it.  

Years pass, things change, and then unimaginable things happen.  And one day you realize you may never return.  But the memory is so close you can touch it."
2021-04-26 23:34,I hope to visit Lisa this week. I am the older brother of Brenda Barton and know Lisa through her and the time we were all at asu. We have talked only briefy since that time but my thought are with Lisa as she is such a great loving person. Brenda told me of her Italy travels and love for the country. I too went to Italy because of Brenda and it is wonderful. Look forward to a great visit.
2021-04-26 23:34,"This was a heartbreakingly beautiful tribute to sisterhood, love, and to Rome."
2021-04-26 23:36,"I am friends with Lisa's big sister and she sent her friends this message this afternoon:
""It is so bitter sweet because just today i heard they are opening up travel to Italy. My sister had wonderful friends in Italy that did take videos, sent photos, FaceTimed etc. from Rome.  

Just got off the phone with Camille and they are moving Lisa to the Hospice Ryan House. She is in a lot of pain we have not been able to manage at home. They don't think she will come home...well, not her home here on earth.  Will be going home to heaven soon😢🙏🏻"
2021-04-27 0:29,This is beautiful I'm sobbing. My atheist prayers go out to her and her wonderful family.
2021-04-27 1:23,"One day, when I make it to Rome, I'll think of Lisa."
2021-04-27 3:28,A heart warming story I understand and respect. Thank you.
2021-04-27 2:11,"My husband died last year of cancer, shortly after my mother died of the same. It reinforced in me the mantra of 'carpe diem.' After tears and wistfulness and regret and loneliness, my sense of humor has returned with a vengeance. I've started working out. COVID will pass. What we will have learned from it can either cripple us or empower us for life."
2021-04-27 2:10,"I see I'm not the only woman that has found herself in love with Italy.  My last trip to Europe was Paris.  This after I've had the great fortune to travel the world.  For years all I have heard is Paris, Paris, Paris.  So I finally went.  And as I departed France I found myself amazed over the fact that in all of the places in the world Italy was still my most magical.  I'd seen Paris, and it was finally official.  My daughter has been told the plan is she takes some of the money and scatters some of my ashes in Tuscany.  I've told her this because I know that Italy will help her heal when the time comes.

I'm sorry that this worked out this way for Lisa.  But boy what a year she got to live.  Of that I have no doubt."
2021-04-27 2:26,"Dear Ms.Maksym,

I am a friend of Brenda Barton whom you spent a year with living in Rome. Like you, I adore Rome to the point of obsession. Ever since Brenda told me about you, I keep hoping that your love of Rome will keep you going against all odds, to get you back to the city you love."
2021-04-27 2:50,Time ravages - but love endures - like Rome
2021-04-26 16:46,"This is a beautiful story of two sisters and the wonderful family to which they both belong. Life seldom turns out as we had expected or as we had once hoped. Lisa and Camille, however, give us all a reminder of how we can adapt and make a difficult situation very much better."
2021-04-27 6:16,"Lovely story, but I have a word of warning - you need a mortuary passport (passaporto mortuario) to bring remains, even ashes into Italy. I know because in March of 2020 before Covid forced us to come home I was trying to arrange for a Rome funeral of my father who had lived in Rome for decades. We too wanted to bring him back, but it will have to wait."
2021-04-27 6:51,"Beautiful story about life and love and being seduced by a foreign land. My heart goes out to Lisa and her family. Keep your hope up.

Miracles do happen!"
2021-04-27 12:50,"I have 2 sisters and naturally we fought about clothing, bathroom time, the 1 home phone.  Our mother always told us, Friends come and go, but Sisters are forever.  Now Mom is living in a LTC site and not doing well, how true her prediction is as we jointly manage her care."
2021-04-27 14:12,"Lovely story. Dreams can be realized in many ways.

 Please, NYT, publish at least one story like this everyday...it has so many life lessons. I commented to my husband that every article in my NYT feed yesterday was depressingly negative."
2021-04-27 14:48,"I am crying. After being beaten down by everything in 2020, most days I feel like I am only existing in this world. I have not cried in a long time until now. This is a sad but beautiful story full of love and gratitude for family, friends, and memories. Makes me think back to the 90s when I had the good fortune to study and travel in Europe and South America (I am 51.) Those were formative experiences, and I have always wanted to ditch the constant grind of work and take time to do it all over again, seeing these places again through the eyes of mid-life. Carpe diem."
2021-04-27 19:31,A family overflowing with love. Peace to them all.
2021-04-27 17:28,"A very moving story. As a former inhabitant of the Eternal City and a fanatic of its AS Roma football club, it is wonderful to read of someone who seems to love the city even more than me. Powerful to read of the love of these two sisters and their family."
2021-04-27 19:32,"Thank you for sharing your beautiful story.
You are truly a blessing and the gift your sister, family and friends gave you is awesome, loving...truly!
Having lived in several countries and had the opportunity to revisit these...I learnt early on to not go back.  The experiences, the places, the people most everything had changed and some not for the best.
At this moment in my life, I haven't much time left.  I am grateful of the memories, the photos and the lovely friends I made...I close my eyes and am back.  Seeing old films, etc. all reminders of the wonderful adventures during my life's journey.  
Lisa, each moment is unique.I see you rejoicing in this knowing..."
