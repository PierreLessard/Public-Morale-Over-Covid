We are not expecting to get back to Australia until Christmas at the earliest and if there is no child vaccine then, is my government going to deny us entry (and trust me, they're already doing a terrible job of helping Aussie citizens getting home)? There needs to be some consistency here across the globe. Many families have already been penalized by general covid regulations (which I understand and have been fine adhering to) and unable to see family members. This should not continue once the vaccine has become more widespread among adults."
2021-02-22 16:35:16,"In Massachusetts, Governor Baker sadly removed the requirement for flu vaccines for schools. Indoor sports have been happening throughout the pandemic, despite many outbreaks, and the CDC acknowledging that for schools to reopen safely in higher-risk towns (such as ours), sports should be held outdoors or remain virtual. The fully-remote classmates of my fully-remote children (in a town that is set to bring many older students, including mine, back to in-person school in March) spent their Feb. vacation doing the following, according to the Monday sharing of vacation week activities: Attending baby showers, sleepovers, birthdays with ""a lot"" of family members attending, indoor soccer games, indoor ice hockey games. How am I supposed to allow my children (upper elementary and middle school) to attend in-person school with these folks in a mere two weeks? They are supposed to eat lunch at school, too, as the days are full days. What would you do? Teacher also have not been vaccinated."
2021-02-22 16:56:38,"This is excellent news. 

With the (hopefully imminent) EUA for J&J and Novavax, which use older and therefore perhaps less intimidating vaccine technology, I hope pediatric trials for those vaccines will begin (perhaps wrapping up by winter 2021). 

As a parent, I would be open to getting my kids the mRNA shots, because I understand the science behind them. However, I think there will be a lot of hesitancy in using this new platform for children in otherwise relatively rational adults. The faster we can diversify the vaccine types tested on and offered to kids, the faster we can overcome vaccine hesitancy and get children vaccinated."
2021-02-22 17:24:39,"While my husband and I will be first in line to get our Moderna or Pfizer jabs, I will be taking a pause before deciding how and when we vaccine our toddler. He has received every one of his childhood vaccines at the regular schedule, including annual flu shots from 6 months. However- any new vaccine technology that is rife with unpleasant side effects- for a disease that has relatively little impact on young children, is going to have to have a much higher hill to climb. These stories of adults with 104 degree fevers, 2 days of vomiting and headaches and fatigue that require 2-3 days of sleeping from their vaccine- are not going to make parents especially eager to sign their child up. Not to say I wouldn't eventually do it, but I'm going to be weighing it, not putting him first in line.

What I would like to see (rational or not) is to primarily inoculate children w/the Johnson & Johnson 1-shot regiments w/ inactivated adenovirus or similar, as it is the same style of vaccine of my child's previous jabs. Even if efficacy is lower (66%)- a one shot regiment with less side effects of existing technology is just more appealing for my 2 year old w/ already low relative risk. This may not feel entirely rational, but I can guarantee it would result in higher degrees of parental participation. If someone like me is pausing (pro vax w/a vaxed child)-- that 30-50% of American that is vaccine suspicious will never get their children vaccinated with an MRNA vaccine"

We're white and not high-risk in any other sense. We've been on complete lockdown since March, and we live under the poverty line. I am so exhausted, and so hopeless, and it looks like there's no end in sight. We're at the very end of the very end of the line. The world will move on without us and my family will go under."
2021-02-22 20:45:32,"My family has made the decision to not send our child back to in-person school until there is a vaccine that gives some protection. There are many (specific to our situation) reasons why we decided not to send our child back until there is a vaccine but I can't imagine there aren't thousands of families in our situation. Granted, we are in a better situation to handle it than most -- my husband makes a good living working from home so I was able to resign from my job and homeschool our child (I was a teacher and child psychologist in my previous life). Not many Americans have that option or teaching skills. So...what are other families in the same position supposed to do? I don't believe that the mental health of our youth will improve if we send them back to school without real and tangible precautions like a vaccine. I think it will make it worse. The stress of possibly getting the virus or giving it to a family member while trying to deal with peers who refuse to take necessary precautions will make the current mental health crisis of our youth look quaint. It is unfair to expect teachers and administrators to make all children follow all safety precautions all the time. It's an unrealistic expectation. It feels like the push is economic yet disguising itself as a mental health issue and most parents are buying it because they are in a desperate situation and need the help. American families are drowning and being forced to make dicey decisions."

Sadly, I find this article depressing and comments such as this one are a blow.  We've been keeping ourselves safe by isolating.  The promise of the vaccine is there (it's not coming as quickly as I had hoped but it's coming).  Instead of hunkering down and making it home safe, we're told to take off our seat belts, put the pedal to the metal and get ready for school in the fall.  If kids cannot be vaccinated, how is it safe?  Even seemingly mild cases can later turn out to carry long term problems -- such as inflamed hearts, lung damage.   And we're expected to put our kids at risk?"

As someone involved in little league baseball for the last 40 years I can tell you that a season begin in early January with registration, moves onto the creation of the teams and on to the first practices, when the boys and girls meet their teammates. Friendships that will carry on for life begin there. The season moves through the cold winds of April, through May as a team grows, then ends with the playoffs in June when the roar of cheers can be heard from ever little league field in the city. All that and more was lost in 2020.

Youth sports has always been more than the games themselves, it’s about making new friends, it’s about not being lonely, it’s about having that thing to look forward to. Youth sports teaches young boys and girls how to work as a team, teaches them that hard work pays off. It is no coincidence that  children that play sports are 85 percent less likely to get involved in drugs or gangs. Children need to be outside under the sun having fun and boosting their immune systems and that true of their parents as well.

This article gives me hope, that it’s all coming back, all of it, the whole year in the life of a child, the sports, the birthday parties, a proper school year with in person teaching, a thanksgiving without fear on the menu, and lastly Christmas and a new year.

The incoming CEO is the former CFO.  Apparently having a background in the sciences or research isn't a priority at Merck or an avenue of getting to the top.  More startling is that Merck sold its ownership position in Moderna when the stock price took off due to their success in developing a covid vaccine.

Advances in nanotechnology supposedly also helped the Moderna vaccine with coating its delivery vehicle with fat which increases its cellular accessibility, and also significantly increases its storage temperature versus Pfizer's vaccine.

Bill de Blasio should worry about New York City.   As the article states, Merck is also working on therapeutics in the event you do contract Covid.

Merck forgot that and lost it's ethical business compass in the 1980s and 1990s when it started putting profits before patients.

I fully agree with this. Merck contributed to the diversity of strategies being perused. We could not have known a first in human mRNA vaccine would be the likely candidate. 

I also admire their willingness to give up. Their vaccines give inferior immune responses to the spike protein, and offer no additional coronavirus antigen, relative to the mRNA vaccines. The right decision is to stop development.

As for the words of caution by the CEO, honestly, I think they came from a place of wisdom. Few experts thought this speed of development was possible. The work done by BioNTech, Pfizer, Moderna, AstraZeneca, J&J, The Russian ministry of health, and Novavax amongst others has been nothing short of stunning. It marks a step change in what's possible.

This “small Maryland company” has a market cap of $20B, with vaccine production facilities in the US, Spain, Germany, the UK, Czech Republic, Canada and South Korea. It has  the best efficacy data against the original virus strain (96%), and the ONLY efficacy data of any vaccine against both the UK variant (87%) and the SA variant (60% among people HIV-). It is already in lab testing with a modified vaccine targeting the South African variant. They have sold more of their vaccine worldwide than anyone. 

Also, none of the other vaccines developed so far actually prevent transmission. What they prevent is moderate to severe disease. In clinical testing on macaque monkeys, the Novavax vaccine prevented viral replication completely. In other words, not only did it prevent them from getting sick from the disease, they had none of it in their bodies, meaning they could obviously not transmit it either. 

All of this combined with ease of transport and storage and a better safety record than any of the other vaccines. 

If Novavax was called Johnson & Johnson or AstraZenica they would be splashed all over the front page of the Times, but for some reason Novavax barely ever gets a mention. And when they do, with even better results than Moderna or Pfizer, their study results are deemed “a setback”.

I would certainly make an appointment if I had some problem such as a broken tooth or pain, but my personal opinion is that a hygiene visit is not worth the risk and I am rigorously flossing as attempt to make up for the lack of scaling.

washed numerous times today... but please add a note to my file:  I prefer that you wash 
in front of me, just before the physical exam. He followed suit, and I didn’t have to ask again.

Yes, you heard that right.  After doing a janitorial task, he promptly approached me to finish a

After his lying and incompetence had caused the deaths of tens of thousands of Americans, it appeared that he, too, might become one of those victims. He escaped, most likely because he was able to obtain the cutting edge, experimental medical care described in the article. 

Most Americans were not that fortunate. All were more deserving."
2021-02-12 14:32:42,The medical heroics and theater surrounding Trump’s infection did more harm than good (as if Trump could care less).  By minimizing the apparent severity of COVID-19 to Trump’s easily-suggestible followers it made the challenge of encouraging taking protective measures much steeper in “red” states.  If Trump had spent time on a ventilator or had died he would probably  have saved upteen other lives.
2021-02-12 14:44:08,"I suspected Trump was ill with COVID when he shouted at Biden during their first debate non stop. 
Twitter was on fire about it. 
Everyone with a clue knew what was up.

Imagine Trump's mindset of going to the debate knowing he had COVID, skirting the testing that was set up, shouting through the entire event as if he were on a cheer leading squad and then going back to the White House thinking ""Job well done."" 
I thank God every day this man is out of office."
2021-02-12 14:51:38,yet another thing they lied about...
2021-02-12 14:41:48,Is anyone surprised that he lied about this too?
2021-02-12 14:49:52,"I’m pretty sure if I was truthful, my comment wouldn’t be kind or “civil.” Although I’ve never wished harm on him or anyone, at this point, as Melanie was so effective in revealing, who really cares? And why does it matter now? What really matters is what’s currently happening; Republicans turning a blind eye, and if body language speaks, they don’t really care what happened on January 6! Shame!"
2021-02-12 14:51:02,Ironic how Trump downplayed anything Dr. Fauci said about the virus yet received top-notch medical treatment. I guess he believes in medicine only when it will benefit him!
2021-02-12 14:22:18,"So the question that has to be asked is, was there any brain damage?

Oh, wait a minute, how would anybody ever know?

Erratic behavior before covid and erratic behavior afterward, maybe his legal team should focus on his treatments and blame them."
2021-02-12 14:37:49,"This was obnoxious to anyone with sense. Just more dictator-style behavior - never admit weakness. How many lives did his farcical macho theater cost? How many people decided that Trump was invulnerable, so they were too?"
2021-02-12 14:30:17,"Great to know that he lied to the American people (again) and that many took his advice that the virus was, ""nothing"" and then died.  And the, ""pro-life"" people still support him."
2021-02-12 14:40:51,"I believe Trump has not fully recovered from the virus. His behavior after being discharged has become more manic and erratic. He rarely listened to advice before but now he has become totally impervious to it, a sign of some brain damage.
I seriously doubt he will be capable of mounting an effective campaign to regain the presidency in 2024 but he will continue to be a danger by encouraging domestic terrorism."
2021-02-12 14:59:26,Brain fog is settling in for the long slide into his little gold gilded corner of Dante's spiral.
2021-02-12 16:03:39,Simply more evidence that Trump lied to the citizens of the United States about the seriousness of the virus and that proves more conclusively that he is responsible for more suffering and deaths.
2021-02-12 16:30:07,"It is ironic that Trump, who caused thousands and thousands of American Covid  deaths due to his denial of science, was given, at our expense, top-notch medical care, while those in brown or black communities continue to suffer the worst effects of the virus. Trump is a walking metaphor for the blatant injustices and inequalities in America."
2021-02-12 15:08:47,Here was a bit of bad luck for the US. Trump did not succumb to the virus. Too bad. It would have saved us from his lies about ‘the steal’ and the insurgency at the Capital.
2021-02-12 15:51:33,So a 70-something man who eats poorly and is overweight has a tough time but beats the virus. Yet we're supposed to be terrified
2021-02-12 16:26:03,"Trump's behavior is that of a classic autocratic ""strongman"" for whom the appearance of strength and power is more important than reality.
He must never appear ""weak"", always hide the truth, and keep feeding his true believers lies, lies, and more lies.

Read Ruth Ben-Ghiat's book, ""Strongmen: Mussolini to the Present"" for a clear eyed exposition of the history and common behavior among all of them, including Trump."
2021-02-12 15:29:37,"Check your sources again. It’s very, very hard to believe Mr. Trump would mislead us about something important, or try to inflate his own abilities."
2021-02-12 15:44:21,"NO, he wasn't THAT sick!  He is releasing this today to distract from his own impeachment, a trick he uses with a lot of success daily."
2021-02-12 15:17:27,"I am shocked. Shocked... Or not... It was pretty clear at the time that we weren’t getting the full story. (But when did the Trump Administration ever give us the full truth about anything?) In less than a day’s time, Trump went from testing positive, but resting comfortably at home, to having “mild symptoms”, to getting air lifted to Walter Reed, but — trust us — he’s really just fine."
2021-02-12 16:35:02,"Dr. Conley: “I didn’t want to give any information that might steer the course of illness in another direction, and in doing so, you know, it came off that we were trying to hide something, which wasn’t necessarily true.”
Wasn’t necessarily true but, in fact, was true. It was so obvious that Dr, Conley was covering for Trump. How so many people enabled Trump’s sham of a presidency is incredible. And for what purpose? Nothing to gain, everything to lose."
2021-02-12 15:10:23,"Of course Trump and his enablers lied about his condition.    Even his physician lied in order to maintain the illusion of strength and competence.    The public lie reveals only how much fear Trump and his propensity for rage ruled the white house. 

Think back to the outrage Republicans had against President Clinton for lying about a dalliance with an aide.   It was never anything more than opportunism, not moral outrage.    Republican morality is real lie."
2021-02-12 16:01:31,"I don't entirely buy the retroactive ""honesty"" of officials close to Trump on this.

Think about all we have learned about others who were truly on the brink of grave illness with Covid - no one that close would be able to go for a joyride hours into the magic-bullet treatment he received. 

All lies. All the time. I do not care one whit."
2021-02-12 15:32:18,"Prior to COVID, former president Trump has been perpetually sicker than anybody has been  willing to guess or admit. Today, the sickness has turned into a national embarrassment, not to mention a danger to the entire world.

It is a mystery why such a critical mass of the American public has volunteered to sign onto the morbid contagion."
2021-02-12 15:44:24,"I’m glad Trump recovered, for the most part. Otherwise I’d never get a chance to see him in jail."
2021-02-12 15:48:55,The doctors had to tread lightly as this happened only weeks from the election.  No one wanted to be forever branded as one who interfered with the election.  Public media could literally mean the death of people who have devoted their entire lives to prolonging life.  The Trump core has shown themselves to be very violent.
2021-02-12 15:38:53,"Dr. “Feel-good” Conley’s excuse for lying about Trump’s condition - that he feared anything less than an upbeat prevarication would risk making Trump’s dire condition even worse - is a perfect metaphor for the GOP right now, as they aver that yes Trump bears “some responsibility” for the riots but, shhh, don’t say it out loud or you’ll only make them angrier. And if we impeach him, then they’ll really riot, so instead let’s give him a medal and name him favorite president of all time, and then we can all get back to bad faith bickering and speechifying over the budget deficit and Hunter Biden. Deal?"
2021-02-12 15:19:13,What should happen is investigate the medical staff to determine if they lied about his medical condition and if they did remove the medical licenses
2021-02-12 16:20:40,"Trump suffers from a general and pervasive sickness that motivates all of his behavior. It is manifested in many ways. A pathological need to lie about EVERYTHING is well documented. Why should anyone be at all surprised by this report?
More to the point, beyond his being a spreader of disease, why should anyone care?"
2021-02-12 14:53:56,"and let me guess, the VP knew nothing about the severity of Trump's condition, leaving our Nation vulnerable due to this mans ego, once more !"
2021-02-12 14:56:08,"This unsurprising information about Trump continues to be news of the most insulting and disgusting kind to anyone who has suffered badly from the virus, and to those whose family members and friends who have been lost to it. 

Through all of Trump's hideous acts, and the grim reality of the pandemic, this maneuver of his perhaps did not get as much attention as it should have - he got extremely ill from Covid and likely would have died if he had received the same treatment as a run-of-the-mill American. The recipient of multiple life-saving and experimental treatments, the patient of dozens of expert physicians, he narcissisticly and blithely emerged to claim that the virus was nothing. 

This abhorrent offense to those who have (and will) suffer from Covid continues to be one of the most harmful acts of his presidency. This was a chance for great good to be done, lives to be saved, and again the man was only thinking of his next great shot and best angle."
2021-02-12 15:48:19,"""Mr. Trump’s blood oxygen level alone was cause for extreme concern...""  Extreme concern by whom?  The tens of thousands of people who died needlessly from the coronavirus because Trump did absolutely nothing to battle the spread?"
2021-02-12 15:45:52,"How evil and maniacal can one be?  Trump has full personal knowledge of the life-threatening nature of COVID, benefits from treatments not available to the public, and continues to play down the severity of the pandemic. Many people died because he chose not to mandate personal safety and protection. Dante needs a new circle just for this occupant."
2021-02-12 16:25:52,"Of course he lied!  Yet once again he was protected from death by the country he’s been trying to destroy.  Was he ever afraid?  Was he grateful for the care and treatment he got that almost no one else could get?  Did he come out of it with a determination to use the power of his office to save others?

The short answer:  No."
2021-02-12 15:40:57,"It was pure theater, and bad theater at that."
2021-02-12 15:15:22,I had just assumed that he was sicker than we were told.  There was plenty of precedent to think so and never any indication that the White House and Trump's doctors could be taken at their word.
2021-02-12 15:02:28,"Reflective wishful thinking of what could have been and, perhaps, what should have been.

What should have been an educational moment for trump, only emboldened him to make light of the virus, all due to his privileged health care.

The result: irresponsible behavior on behalf of his believers bringing about prolonged unnecessary suffering and death for many without the protections afforded trump.

We’re he only have used his experience as a warning to others, we’d be further along in this battle and trump would more than likely now be viewed in better light."

2021-02-12 16:16:39,"In a government of the people, by the people and for the people the elected officials are supposed to be incidental to the governance of the nation. 

It’s a cornerstone of a democratic republic that all leaders are easily replaced and essentially interchangeable with anyone else and we've gone down a dangerous path by forgetting that. 

The whole notion of special medical treatment and physical protection for elected officials has caused the country much more damage than leaving their fates to chance."
2021-02-12 15:50:52,"And here we are. Hundreds of thousands of our family members and friends are needlessly dead, thanks to this lousy, malevolent human being and his associates and the people who have protected, enabled, normalized him. Millions of us are still needlessly suffering from severe complications, months after contracting the virus, thanks to them. Given the stupid, ignorant, reckless, irresponsible behavior of the man and his administration, it was inevitable that he would contract it. That said, I didn't want the virus to give us poetic justice. I wanted and still want the real thing. Real justice in a court of law. Actual accountability for real wrongdoing. A real Senate impeachment trial in front of senators who are nothing like most of the Republicans, senators who stand strongly behind their oaths and constitutional duties, who value truth, morality, justice, democracy."
2021-02-12 16:23:33,"I passed over reading this story several times because my first reaction to the headline was, “Who cares?” I don’t."
2021-02-12 16:24:31,"Duh... I mean he lies about the most meaningless of things, you expect he told the truth and directed his minions to tell the truth about something of actual importance?"
2021-02-12 16:24:44,"You have to be a little more specific with your headline. It should have read was sicker physically.

We still don't know the extent of mental damage."
2021-02-12 15:18:34,"Unfortunately, he wasn’t sick enough!"
2021-02-12 15:43:18,"had he died, covid 19 would be hailed as a hero."
2021-02-12 15:48:53,"So Trump's doctor patently lied to the media and to the American people to protect the 'sicker than acknowledged' former president. That is in perfect keeping with his entire mendacious administration. It started with lies about his health (""Trump is the healthiest person to ever walk the earth — period!"") to doctors insisting his blood oxygen level never sank below 90.

In hindsight, who cares how sick he was?"
2021-02-12 15:55:08,"Just pitiful. Politics trumps everything. Reflects not even the health of the nation, communicating to the citizenry the appropriate message that this virus is real and dangerous is not as important as trying to secure votes. 400,000 dead. Of course you can't quantify it, but did people die as a result of phony information. And a doctor/medical personnel in on the ruse? If that could be proven, this should be a problem for these people's careers. The garbage we're fed!"
2021-02-12 16:59:34,"Trump often confuses success and failure.  Maybe he’s dislexic, too, further explaining why he never reads."
2021-02-12 15:39:20,Perhaps the lowered oxygen levels are what made him go from criminal to criminally insane.

Scary thing about it all, he almost pulled it off with the violent attempt to overthrow his own government."
2021-02-12 16:47:18,"This story is yet another White House LIE told to the American people. Add it to the 20,000 or more other lies they have told us. 

It was trump's oversized vanity and fear of showing weakness...he's human like all the rest of us...and not the superhero of his fevered dreams.

A little humility and empathy might have helped to reduced the number of Covid-19 fatalities...standing now at over 487,455 Americans.

2021-02-12 16:00:16,"Everyone with half a brain and a few observational skills knew that Trump was much sicker than his doctors would ever admit. From the course of treatment alone it was obvious. It was also clear that they were putting on a show for the Trumpists, pretending that Mr. Macho Macho Man was invincible, just like any other two-bit banana republic dictator. All that he lacked were the big gold epaulets and rows of fake medals on his chest."

What accounts for his prior lack of taste?"
2021-02-12 16:20:14,I hate to say it but it’s too bad it wasn’t more serious. Maybe Trump would have actually gotten scared enough to care and do something about it. Too bad he didn’t fight Covid with the same heart he fought losing the election. What a sad little man.
2021-02-12 16:46:41,"It was pretty obvious that they were gaslighting us once again with Trump's illness, but good to have it so thoroughly reported on now, even after the fact. Thank you.

But it's yet another head-shaking bout of Trump-fetich lunacy on the GOP's part. With the Coronavirus nearly killing Trump while also taking the lives of two of its Congressmen and one of its major Presidential candidates -- I guess nothing will make the GOP take it seriously. All I can conclude is that it's too profitable to use Trumpian lies about the virus and anti-vax idiocy as yet another ""individual liberty"" fund-raising scam. And how many hundreds of thousands of lives have they sacrificed to that now? Even one was too many. And that is what's truly sickening."

Let me see if I have this right:  Giving accurate information could steer the course of an illness??!!  
And, in giving misleading, inaccurate, incomplete information ""it came off that we were trying to hide something"".

He led it, his sycophants followed him, and those who dared contradict him were pushed aside or shouted down. Let’s grant the disease the first 50,000 deaths; the rest of them are squarely on his lying shoulders. His willful inaction has created an American genocide. What are we, as a people and as a government, going to do about it?"

Is covid controllable with steroids?  I know he had access to the best care in the world but 500,000 American have died - Now it seems with steroids at the outset that it didn’t have to be this way.

Shame on us.  Shame on Trump and his whole administration for their war on masking and their denial the virus was real."

It is very clear that the lack of values will ultimately force the public into greater violence and conflict.

It’s funny, even people I know who who don’t follow politics latched onto the COVID story because he’d previously lied about his weight. Their response was, “well he’s got a preexisting condition being obese.” Everyone with eyes knew he was higher risk being obese. Yet his team never acknowledged his obesity when they disclosed his COVID diagnosis because they’d previously lied about his weight.

Notice how all of Trump’s woes come from lying?"
2021-02-12 15:59:53,"Unless they are dead, and sometimes even when they are dead, the Presidents' physicians always paint the rosiest of pictures about the Presidents. The leader of the free world cannot be projected as weak, regardless of who he is or what political party he is from. One would think that would just be common sense. There are too many enemies of the US out there who would happily exploit it if they know that the POTUS is not at the top of his game. That's exactly why they haven't disclosed the severity of Biden's dementia."

A constant refrain of ""he erupted in anger"" or ""he raged"" about (fill in the blank)"".

Such a poor excuse of a man. His anger, grievances, and hatred are and have been, for anyone who wants to see, on exhibit.

But I wish the media would just stop reporting on anything Trump. I've had my fill of these horrible four years. While I know the mainstream media will continue to report on this ex-President and his criminal behavior, I refer you to how peaceful it's been since Twitter banned him and his tweets. Blessed silence from his lies and bile."

But the bitter pill is that he got world class health care (even though he pays a measly $750 in taxes); he got medical treatment that the average American would never get.  He mismanaged the pandemic response, causing so many deaths and infections among Americans. We still do not have enough information on the long term effects of the disease on the survivors, yet Trump wanted to get rid of the Affordable Care Act including its pre-existing condition protections. If he did that then all of those COVID survivors in the future may have been denied health care for a “pre-existing condition.”  Let that sink in... So to summarize, he lied about the pandemic; caused it to spread more rapidly; had no plan to deal with it; and wanted to take away health care from people that got infected all while he (the tax evader) got top notch health care.  Sounds about right for him and his ilk. Let them eat cake...."

His hallucinations, like 'the election was stolen'  attest."

His sister and his niece have both given ample information about his volatile and very selfish behavior; behavior that is basic to who and what he is."
2021-02-12 17:08:59,"When are we going to find out what prompted djt's unscheduled visit to Walter Reed in or around Nov. 2019, whose purpose, he claimed, was merely to get a head start on his normal physical for 2020?

I won't be surprised to learn, after djt's death, that his autopsy shows either some form of dementia or evidence of mutliple mini-strokes. Or both.

It's completely unacceptable that Americans are not given a complete picture of every major candidate's physical AND mental health *before* s/he is elected."
2021-02-12 18:00:14,"Think of all the make-work opportunities that ex-President Trump has provided.

Graduate students will dine out on his administration for years if not decades to come.  They will expend huge resources estimating the Presidential policy-induced death toll along with estimates of the president value of the associated economic losses.

It is important to recognize how Trump's policies have benefited Americans of higher socio-economic standing.  For those 9% of Americans currently without health insurance, the cost-benefit analysis might not look so rosy."
2021-02-12 14:29:34,"I am sorry, but Dr. Sean Conley needs to be disciplined for failing to tell the truth to the American people. This is not your standard HIPAA situation, as his patient is the president of the United States and commander in chief. He owes the people a truthful accounting of the president's condition, whether or not the president wishes it. And there have to be consequences for failing in one's duty, even if inexplicably there never are for Trump himself."
2021-02-12 14:45:35,"A tally of the costs of his hospital care is in order. After minimizing the risks of covid and not mandating masks for the protection of all, President Trump had care that would bankrupt the average American. Infuriating in light of the persistence of Republicans to strip affordable access to health insurance for many Americans. Extra dangerous when he made his recovery seem easy - “I feel fantastically” - and went on to hold even more super spreader rallies."

Why trump needs to lie about everything is beyond me."

If he truly believed that Covid-19 is a lie, then he should’ve refused medical treatment. Yet another case of when Trump and other wealthy men are perfectly willing to make reasons for why they need something that they have said others don’t need and shouldn’t get."
2021-02-12 15:54:02,"The Trump administration was one lie after another. What else was hidden from the public, or twisted into falsehood over the past few years? It boggles the mind to imagine. 

Two of my family members are dead from COVID who would likely still be alive were Trump never put into office. Yet, Trump made light of the virus, received cutting-edge medical treatment unavailable to us peons (free of charge, of course), and then urged his supporters ""don't be afraid of the virus, don't let it take over your life"" after he was discharged from Walter Reed.

I can't write what I'd really like to say here."

Just think of the power as POTUS he would have had by telling Americans the truth about this dreaded coronavirus. One has to ask the question: How many deaths, how many people infected could have been spared if only he told the truth? But he chose arrogance and hubris, pride and deceit. Yes, as a human being I and many others do not want to witness anyone succumbing to COVID. Yet what kind of a person insists on deceiving his people, insists on keeping them in the arms of ignorance?"

2021-02-12 16:43:15,"Well Trump always talks about fake news. So now we hear that he was really in a bad place with the virus. And we hear it now just as the impeachment hearings are under way. Hmm do you smell a fish???? 

I always felt that his brush with COVID was a sham. That he had come down with the flu and used the symptoms to say he had COVID so he could promote all of those drugs he was so fond of. And them make himself a superman as he recovered probably from taking flu medication! I have never, all through this pandemic, heard of someone with COVID get well so fast. And now to hear he should have even been sicker???? 
If he really was that sick he should have been put on a respirator. Then he'd have really known what it felt like for a normal citizen to get COVID. Maybe we wouldn't have to deal with his vaccination screwups now!"

He is also morbidly obese with many hidden health problems and would have been consigned by overwhelmed Hospitals to a minimal medical intervention in the US.

How many hundreds of thousands of COVID19 victims  in the US, who died painful and lonely deaths without their loved ones to comfort them in their passing would be alive today if they received this state of the art care?

This is also, the President who incited and instructed his insurrectionist right wing mob and militia to invade the Capitol to prevent Joe Biden becoming President on the 6th January. I hope justice is done against the worst President in history. There needs to be a reckoning for all of this."
2021-02-12 18:47:26,"It's sad to read this, really.  Just think of the hundreds of deserving, good people who could have benefited from the treatments that Trump got.  Theirs would have been lives worth saving.  Instead those beneficial treatments were wasted on Trump.  What a shame."
2021-02-12 17:33:24,"Okay, me, I doubt Trump even had COVID. A bad cold, maybe. He used it as an opportunity to get attention, his favorite pass time, show how powerful and resilient he was. And...messaging...if I can be infected and get over it, so can YOU! No big deal. Very conceivably presented to the public as another episode of the Trump Presidency envisioned and set up by him as one ongoing entertainment extravaganza."

2021-02-12 17:22:47,"Trump lies about everything.

Trump was sufficiently incapacitated that the 25th Amendment should have been invoked, and Pence should have been named temporary President.

But of course Trump would never allow Pence, or anyone else, to take power from him, even if the fate of the country were at stake.

In sharp contrast, President Biden cares about America, and will tell the complete truth about any medical condition he will have."
2021-02-12 17:55:12,Did anyone really think that Trump would permit the doctors to speak the truth about his medical condition? Did anyone really believe that he was rushed to Walter Reed and given extraordinary treatment if he wasn't seriously ill. Trump hasn't been truthful to the American people  except once when he said: the system us rigged. He promised that he alone could fix that rigged system but that of course was a lie.
2021-02-12 20:06:03,"This is not surprising news. That trump wants to project himself as ""Big Strong He-Man Who Rode This Pony Like A Champ"" is to be expected. But not even conferring power to Pence knowing full well that he was too debilitated to act as POTUS at a time that would be ripe for havoc to break loose -- this is more than irresponsible, it is criminally negligent.  
Oh well. It's not like we didn't already know what he is. Remember what Toni Morrison said - ""When somebody shows you who they are , believe them the first time."" 
I think the take away must be that going forward, the R party not select him as their candidate in 2024. Even though they may acquit him now for practical reasons, he is clearly a deficit to that party, and a clear and present danger to our nation. I'm not a member of that party but as a US citizen (and for that matter, just as someone who lives on this PLANET) I'd fear what could happen if, after all that's gone down these four years, Trump received even one iota of further validation once the current mock trial is over."
2021-02-12 19:59:58,"I received the BAM infusion after it was FDA approved for COVID the beginning of January. Only certain criteria allowed me to have it (senior with auto-immune diseases) one day after testing positive. I had no breathing issues and it took about an hour and a half at the hospital. My husband got the infusion the next day when he tested positive (senior with COPD, asthma, one lung from Agent Orange Vietnam Vet). Our doctor was amazing here in NE Ohio.

2021-02-12 20:20:40,"It would me more accurate to say that Dr. Sean P. Conley, Mr. Trump’s physician, misled the public about his health, rather than merely downplaying it. This report also reveals that there more physicians, especially a few at Walter Reed, who bear responsibility for hiding the president's true condition. 

They knew full well that the patient they were dealing with was not just any person, but the president of the country. They also knew that it was the public who would be paying for their services. Didn't the public have the right to know what it was paying for?

Let's hope that they would be held to account for what they did."

You choose to present this as another stain! Why? What’s your point now? He’s out of office! His administration is over. History will be the judge, not You! 
It’s this constant badgering and down reporting of Trump that’s exhausting. 
Have you nothing more pertinent to write about like school openings and the horrible distribution at local levels of this vaccine. What about Cuomo lying about deaths and Newsom eating out when his state was closed. These are relevant. 
Trumps bought with Covid is not important any more.

2. What a surprise they lied about his condition.

4. If this is some bizarre attempt to coddle sympathy for this President, I doubt with 478,000 corpses and their families without the normal channels to grieve, a man who sent an angry lethal mob to hang his own VP will receive his karmic bounty. What that bounty is, I have no idea, but, I would not ever wish it on someone I cared about. 
5. While I think wishing sickness is petty, I also don't have to care about a man who clearly doesn't care for his supporters or those assigned to protect him and the Capitol; both officer Brian Sicknick and Ms. Ashli Babbitt are now dead.

To continue to have super spreader rallies and put his supporters in danger indicates a complete lack of empathy. Trump supporters believe everything he says.

2021-02-09 12:57:55,"Thank you for reporting about this, what I refer to as ""ITP.""
My son had this in the past, twice. One time he was hospitalized with platelets just below 10,000. Now at least when he does receive the immunization, we know to be aware."
2021-02-09 13:12:21,"So apparently the physician was encouraged to change ""the standard treatments, including platelet transfusions along with steroids and immune globulins,"" and the patient either consequently or coincidentally improved after the change in regimen. Any chance we could learn what this change in treatment was? I know, we should not be armchair physicians, but sometimes important and helpful ideas can be passed on to caregivers who may not have access to the ideas of experts."
2021-02-09 13:23:05,"So glad you ran this article.  I have been trying to obtain more information on this topic to no avail.  I am now 71 but had my spleen removed in my thirty’s due to ITP.  My platelet count dropped to 3000.  This was my second occurrence within a 10 year time frame.  After being hospitalized for 6 weeks on high doses of steroids and hemoglobin transfusions with little to know increase in platelets it was determined my spleen was attacking my platelets.  At the time of this occurrence I was living in Staten Island, New York.  I was very fortunate to have survived.  I normally go for blood work every 3 months due to hypertension and cholesterol medication, and always have my platelets checked.  Since the removal of my spleen I have not had an occurrence.  However after reading about the doctor and now this article I am very reluctant to get the vaccine.  I did contract a very mild case of Covid recently and was told to wait 90 days before getting the vaccine. If someone in the medical field reads this I would love to have input."

2021-02-09 13:31:49,"ITP is a known complicate of MMR in childhood- but almost always short lived and benign.

2021-02-09 13:42:56,Thank you for this article. Transparency allows scientists and renown physicians like Drs. Bussel and Fauci to work out cause and effect and how best to manage. I received my first Moderna injection this week and I still plan on receiving the second one.
2021-02-09 13:48:29,"More research of sharing of data needs to be done with this. What does a patient who currently has ITP do with this information? I have a close family member with ITP and platelets are around 100,000 at baseline. More work needs to be done to show the effects of the mRNA vaccines in current ITP patients.   There is definitely a causal link between these mRNA vaccines and induction of severe ITP, but Moderna and Pfizer are not willing to say that yet. The VAERS system will show reports of adverse effects 4-6 weeks after it has been reported, so there might be more cases that just aren't made public yet."
2021-02-09 13:53:24,"I re-read this article but can't find what the ""different course of treatment"" actually was. Isn't that at the core of the story? So far, it merely states that some patients have a reaction to the vaccination regimen and these platelet anomalies are newer. I could have stated that with no experience."
2021-02-09 14:25:38,"So grateful that Times ran this story.  I have just gotten over the death of Florida doctor from ITP by rationalizing that he is the only case.  Now there are dozen other cases.  With a history of critically low platelets and other immune issues, I think I will wait on Covid vaccines for now.  (In case someone misunderstands me, I am 100% pro vaccine in general)."

2021-02-09 14:48:29,I have occasionally had neutropenia and I am not on chemo or any medication. The neutropenia has always self corrected. I have now had both doses of the Moderna vaccine. My only reaction was soreness in the arm near the injection site.
2021-02-09 15:00:55,"I am an ITP patient (platelet level averages 23,000). I do not take medication for it. I am retired and have done hundreds of hours of researching medical journal articles on ITP. I am 95% confident that the ""different course of treatment"" recommended was to administer a romiplostim/Nplate injection or to take a Eltrombopag/Promacta pill. I am not a doctor. Taking the vaccination by ITP patients is recommended by most hematologists. I will take it as soon as it is available to me."

2021-02-09 15:44:24,"I am 83, my husband 79.   We have chosen not to receive this vaccine because we do not trust it to be safe.  4 of our relatives report the second dose of Moderna made them feverish, with muscle aches and headaches for 2 days.  Instead of risking this, we choose strict quarantine, go nowhere other than for a walk on the beach in fresh air once a day (5 min from our  house), and to absolutely necessary doctor appointments."
2021-02-09 16:12:52,"So far we have not see ITP occur after the vaccine more than what we would expect in the general population. It is plausible that the vaccine caused this but we don’t know for sure. It certainly warrants monitoring and further study. Not mentioned in the article is that COVID itself, like many viral infections, can cause ITP as well. The risk of that would need to be weighed against the risk of ITP from the vaccine if causality is shown."

Are the (new) mRNA vaccines the issue as they have been rushed? Should I wait for the Johnson & Johnson one, which is more traditional? Am I the only one thinking this way?"
2021-02-09 17:10:10,"By chance I had my yearly exam four days after receiving my first Moderna vaccine.  I had my yearly labs drawn yesterday one week after receiving the vaccine and all my labs are normal, in particular, my platelet count is normal at 184K."
2021-02-09 17:20:17,"""...so far, rates of the condition in vaccinated people did not appear higher than the rates normally found in the U.S. population, so the cases could be coincidental.""

I appreciate the importance of honest reporting on vaccine safety and all the great work the NYT has done in this regard. But I'm also concerned that public misperceptions around vaccine safety will limit uptake, resulting in unnecessary deaths. Given that ""rates of the condition in vaccinated people did not appear higher than the rates normally found in the U.S. population,"" I'm wondering why this warranted an article; you could write a similar article about any other medical condition. At the very least, I wish the above quote were highlighted in the first paragraph.

Thank you, again, for all your diligent reporting on the pandemic."
2021-02-09 17:25:13,"I am not sure why, but I have always been afraid of vaccines. I never get the flu shot, but I desperately want to get vaccinated against Covid. The stories about severe psychiatric symptoms experienced by some people and the cases where the virus attacks organs are enough for me to get vaccinated, but I still have this (irrational) fear. The media tends to point out cases where people develop allergic reactions and now this, but it does not highlight the near million each day that have no issues. I think there should be a focus on the good this is doing as well. Even vaccinated your supposed to live life like your not...Hmm."
2021-02-09 15:35:49,"From this article, I have concluded only one thing - journalism degrees must not require statistics."
2021-02-09 15:16:54,Had any of those who got ITP previously been innoculated with vaccines known to cause IPT?
2021-02-09 15:58:49,"If I were Sarah, I'd take a pass on the second shot. We don't need 100% of the population to get immunized. People who have had such a dangerous reaction would be wiser to take a chance of getting the virus."
2021-02-09 15:19:30,This is terrifying. I really wish the drug companies were more forthcoming.
2021-02-09 16:47:08,This is impossible. We have been brainwashed to accept that vaccines are saviors and drug companies are infallible.
2021-02-09 13:54:01,Has the virus caused similar platelet loss?
2021-02-09 16:52:26,"This is a well written and researched piece but like others I’m not quite sure what to do with it. I had ITP at 20, treated with steroids and ultimately a splenectomy. I’m 64 and eagerly awaiting the vaccine but now I wonder. Does the lack of a spleen increase the likelihood of this side affect or decrease it? Have other autoimmune diseases been triggered? Given the slow roll out of the vaccine in CA I should have a few more months to contemplate this."
2021-02-09 13:35:19,"Great reporting. Only one case published in the literature so far in a patient who responded to IV IgG and steroids. Hopefully someone will publish a small series soon? 

Agree with others —it would be important to know how to access the alternative Rx (per Jim Bussel)— assume other hematologists will know (?)"
2021-02-09 13:45:55,I understand the risks but until this is resolved or the current vaccines studied more I am going to pass on getting it. They told us thalydomide and the dalkon shield were safe and they turned out not to be at all. I will happily stay at home.
2021-02-09 17:04:38,"If you have other autoimmune diseases, unrelated to immune thrombocytopenia, could you still develop it?
There needs to be data released that provides info for those suffering from auto-immune disorders so they can avoid serious complications!"
2021-02-09 17:33:54,"So that leaves the Pfizer vaccine?

My first shot (Moderna) was 7 days ago, with no subsequent  problems worth writing about.

I'm high risk of Covid 19 due to age and with the large proportion of Covid 19 deaths in my age category, the risk of death from Covoid 19 far outweighs the risk of death from any of the vaccines so far reported on. 

So glad I didn't know about the platelet issue with Moderna before the shot; I would have worried some, but gone for it anyway.

Last week, there was no choice as to which of the two vaccines in the US we were able to get. If I had known about the decrease in platelet counts and had a choice, I would have gone for Pfizer. But
it's done now and after the 10-14 day wait for the vaccine to work.  I will take a look at how safe my hair dresser salon and gym look. I haven't heard of platelet problems after the second dose of Moderna. There's reporting California is providing so many first shots, we may run out of vaccines for the 2nd shot. So everyday is another situation. That's life in these covid times."
2021-02-09 17:44:29,"I think they should have mentioned that thrombocytopenia has also been noted following many covid infections.  So if the vaccine with only the spike protein induced this, it might be that the virus itself also would have too.  Thrombocytopenia is known to be caused by other viral infections too."
2021-02-09 17:56:21,I have a mild case of Von Willebrand’s disease which involves the platelets not sticking properly. Anyone knowledgeable with thoughts on my getting the vaccine with this condition?
2021-02-09 18:15:18,What about people who have already had Covid-induced blood clotting complications? Will the mRNA vaccines by Moderna and Pfizer exacerbate these symptoms? For those of us with pre-existing blood clotting issues - should we look at other non mRNA vaccines options? There are several potential options being developed such as intranasal and inactivated virus vaccines. Would those be safer?
2021-02-09 15:43:14,"Sarah was freakishly unlucky and was nearly killed by the first Moderna  vaccine she got.  Yet her doctors said she could get the second one.  What?  WHAT !  ! ! That’s not solid medical advice.  It makes me want to shout - Sarah Dont Do It !  Instead, I’ll just wish Sarah the best of luck from here on out."
2021-02-09 17:50:10,Have any of the people been diagnosed with Von  Willebrand disease?
2021-02-09 18:03:32,I find it disturbing that Sarah C. is musing about taking the Pfizer vaccine as her second dose. I'm not aware of studies that show vaccine efficacy in mixing the two formulations. I hope she shares her thinking with her doctor or other medical experts.
2021-02-09 17:16:31,"Thank you for this article!

I know someone with this condition and he was not aware of any of this information before this article was published. He hasn't gotten the vaccination yet and will now make certain to consult with his physician before he gets it."
2021-02-09 18:26:46,"The natural incidence of thrombocytopenia seems to be 50,000 in the United States, which has a population near 330 million. If these newly reported cases are indeed attributable to the vaccine shots then, at a current case count of 36, the attributable incidence rate is less than one-hundredth what would naturally be seen in a random population of 31 million patients - which was itself already a very small rate of incidence.

These vaccine induced occurrences are troubling, even tragic - but they must be viewed in perspective."
2021-02-09 18:43:16,"I’ve seen more than a few people post photos of their legs looking like this in FB vax experience groups. With fewer than 1% of vaccine injuries reported, this is a good example of why.  Drs are very quick to dismiss that it had anything to do with the jab.  A lot of coincidences happening."
2021-02-09 18:53:05,"This information is troubling to me personally. My own immune system is compromised, being a myasthenia gravis sufferer who has already gone through a myasthenia crisis with full lung collapse, which required me to be first intubated, then to have a tracheotomy done, and then to be put on a ventilator for 8 weeks. I survived, but continue to live on medication, and will for the rest of my life deal with lung and throat secretions which make me vulnerable to future lung infections.

Despite that, I fully intend to get my two vaccines to combat the novel coronavirus. However, I sincerely hope that the clinical community of immunologists world wide can locate the cause of this possible coincidence, and determine what medical treatments can be used to bring this infection under control. 

And, as an aside, there is a comment by another reader citing the annual incidence of thrombocytopenia as being 50,000, and compares it to the total U.S. population of 330 million. That is an erroneous comparison. The proper comparison is the infected 50,000 with the combined infection  and death rates for COVID-19 today, which comes to approximately 27, 500,000. That is a far more threatening ratio."
2021-02-09 18:46:27,"I really respect the publishing of this article, to acknowledge the (exceedingly rare) link between the virus and the occurrance of this condition. It is important for people to really READ the entire article so they understand that the rate of occurrance is the same as in the general population. They also state that even if a causational link were to be established, that the overall health risk of receiving the vaccine is lower than the overall health risk of NOT receiving the vaccine. (And that is not even considering the herd immunity theories of vaccination.) 

This fact-facing article should help DEBUNK false/sensationalized claims regarding the potential dangers of being vaccinated."
2021-02-09 19:48:36,So far all the online quack conspiracies have not gotten to me but this... this worries me. It really does seem too coincidental that the vaccine is not involved with causing this platelet issue. I already have a blood disorder (Sickle Cell disease) that has been a life-long pain the rear and this makes me wonder if the vaccine would somehow make that worse; I don't need anymore trouble with my blood. Hopefully more research can be done about this issue and in the meantime... wear a mask.
2021-02-09 20:15:54,"A good reporter would have asked the doctors/experts/regulators to elaborate on what specific criteria/tests and other information are that would be needed to determine that the vaccination actually CAUSED this disorder. 

It's been over 5 weeks since the doctor in Florida passed away from this disorder. Neither the vaccine company or the ""authorities"" have come out with a transparent explanation of what caused his death and whether it was the vaccine. Their ""investigation"" seems to be lasting forever!"
2021-02-09 15:56:06,Hi does anyone have the contact of the physician whose treatment might have saved the life of this patient ; it might be useful for NYT to open source such treatment protocol (of course with disclosure that we do not know that it works as yet) to enable others who might face this risk to at least try out this treatment regime in such an emergency.
2021-02-09 18:21:32,"I think it’s absolutely critical that this article be amended to note that COVID-19 can also cause immune thrombocytopenia. I am sure that there will be some people who read this article who choose not to get a vaccine afterward, not realizing that they also have a slight risk of developing this serious condition if they catch COVID-19 as well. While I appreciate the free dissemination of information, we need to be sure that journalism on this topic doesn’t negatively affect public health."
2021-02-09 15:15:50,"Given the spotty science overseen by Mr. Faucci and his ilk, it does not surprise one bit to find this kind of personal catastraphe being dismissed.  Their philosophy in breaking the entire social, political and economic bedrock of the country over this pendemic has been premised on the needs of the few outweighing the needs of the many.  Or, to put it more comfortingly, our advanced civilization must prioritize the weakest among us.  Apparently that is unless that minority conflicts with the sealed and certified ""expertise"" of flatten curve until vaccine can be produced.  As for the science, these complications should come as no surprise given what was anecdotally but alarmingly reported in terms of covid-19 pathology, causing inflammation and bleeding in everything from lungs to brain to heart in select ""high media value"" cases.  Fact is that many factors related to clotting should have been explored, specifically binding sites on the Sars-cov-2 virus, in order to build a risk profile of the population.  That was not done out of apprehension that the pandemic could then have been managed intelligently rather than using fear and the strong arm of government to dictate terms of existence to citizens and small businesses, using the ""universal"" emergency as justification to suspend the US and state Constitutions.   If you lack a working knowledge of things like von Willebrand factor, which will likely be shown to be implicated in this issue, then I suggest reading up on it."
2021-02-09 15:52:09,"Some commenters here would have liked the article to detail  the treatment protocol Dr. Bussell recommended. I understand the author's reasons for not doing so. I'm not a healthcare professional, let alone an MD, so this comment isn't medical advice -- just possible sources of information about this very rare condition:

If you have symptoms like those described in the article, your physician *might* either consult with a hematologist, or do a search on PubMed or directly in medical journals  such as the American Journal of Hematology.

That said, here is a good starting point for the current approved treatments for ITP: 
<a href=""https://rarediseases.info.nih.gov/diseases/5194/idiopathic-thrombocytopenic-purpura"" target=""_blank"">https://rarediseases.info.nih.gov/diseases/5194/idiopathic-thrombocytopenic-purpura</a>

For consumer-oriented health information, I recommend MedlinePlus from the US National Library of Medicine. It tends to give more detailed information than you'd find on commercial health websites. If you search MedlinePlus for thrombocytopenia, you might read articles 6,7, or 8 first. Another benefit - no advertising!"
2021-02-09 20:03:17,"finally, you stopped ignoring all the online reports of negative reactions to vaccines, it's a step in the right direction, science should not be politicized"
2021-02-09 21:13:35,"I made the mistake of visiting the VRAES website and ran reports to look at all the adverse corona virus vaccine events; the reports were too large to see all the cases. My dad is registered for his vaccine and I am frankly afraid due to his age. There are so many people who have had very bad side effects and have died.  It is very worrisome because you don’t know if you will be unlucky. In terms of percentages, the vaccine is still a wise choice."
2021-02-09 21:38:41,"At no point is there a mention of a covid test for any of people who have suffered from ITP. Were they positive at the time they took the vaccine? Perhaps asymptomatic or only mildly affected? This might explain why they exhibited a loss in thrombocytes so quickly. Also what if millions have a significant decrease in thrombocytes after the vaccines that they are unaware of? I mean what if you should not exercise for a time after the shot?  Should everyone get blood drawn before and after the first vaccine? I still don’t get why the vaccine makers did not have three groups, one with saline, one with everything but mRNA and one with the vaccine as is. At least this should have been done in animals and if such data exists then should be released to the public. Our mom has taken Pfizer as a first shot at our urging and in one week she had a horrible attack of tachycardia. She suffers from it, but has not had one in the past year. We keep agonizing if perhaps tweaking her immune system, especially in an 80 year old cancer survivor may be quite a shock to her peaceful status quo. We are of the thought that we should definitely delay her second shot by 12 weeks as in the UK. It just might give her time to stabilize before being boosted to uncomfortable levels. Honestly, I really like what the UK is doing by giving everyone one shot and simply delaying the second. This way, the governments, medical researchers and citizens can buy time trying to ensure all are reasonably safe."
2021-02-09 22:40:41,"I am a 64 year old previously healthy physician who developed severe burning and numbness in my face 30 minutes after receiving the Pfizer Covid vaccine 7 weeks ago. Since that time, I have had severe neurological symptoms that have not improved. I have been severely debilitated since receiving the vaccine. I have reported my reaction to Pfizer, VAER’s, the CDC and FDA and there has been no response or documentation of my reaction. I have seen many physicians and have had an extensive evaluation and there has been no explanation for my symptoms and no recommendation for treatment. I wonder how many other people have experienced neurological reactions from these vaccines. I worry that I may not recover after 7 weeks of being severely ill."
2021-02-09 22:25:49,Could it be related to the fact that the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines are mRNA based?
2021-02-09 21:18:44,"...and advising a different course of treatment""

What was that treatment? Is it a secret?"
2021-02-09 22:35:04,How many millions were fine? How many will be dissuaded from the vax because of a few?
2021-02-09 22:43:04,"It’s math, on 5 billion people there will be some tragically bad reactions. I wish the media would stop amplifying what are things that are on par for the course."
2021-02-10 00:02:04,"As millions and millions more people get vaccinated we will begin to see a temporal association with the vaccine and all sort of medical conditions. I wouldnt even begin to blame the vaccine unless you can show that the particular complication you want to blame is occuring at a higher rate in vaccine recipients  than the background rate in the general population.    Whats wrong about this article being published, is the possible and likely harm is that there are people who will read this and stay away from the vaccine, and the chance of that person dying or getting severely ill from covid is much, much higher than that person getting severe low platelet counts. Lets ask how many people are going to not take the vaccine because of this article and die of Covid?"
2021-02-09 18:29:04,"The fact that we found out about 1 of the 36 because she posted it on Facebook is a little discouraging.  Would this article have been written if the Facebook posting wasn't made?  Even if it's a rare side effect, were Moderna and Pfizer planning on telling people to seek help if they see red spots on their wrists and ankles?"
2021-02-10 01:20:26,"Von Willebrand disease does not cause thrombocytopenia. And if one reads the article closely you’ll see that VIRAL illnesses can be associated with ITP as well as Guillain-Barré syndrome. People with Covid get arterial and venous thrombi, likely from vascular inflammation that causes the Kawasaki-like disease seen in children with Covid.  They clot and bleed and develop thrombocytopenia just from being acutely ill. There are nearly 500,000 people dead in this country and not all are old or immunocompromised. I’ve taken my chances with the vaccine and am grateful it is available. All of the people who want to refuse it are welcome to. That means my child with a chronic illness can get his sooner so go ahead and refuse."
2021-02-10 01:39:17,I had enlarged lymph nodes and fever after my second dose and I regret absolutely nothing. The COVID vaccine possibly saved my life and the lives of people around me. I don’t mind the side effects.
2021-02-10 01:58:17,"The prevailing narrative has always been there were no severe side effects associated with the genetics vaccines currently being administered.  They were safe.

Every time a severe case occurred, some tried to explain it away.

If we want to build trust, the authorities (government, pharma, and the medical industrial complex) need to be transparent with the public by publishing the percentage of  severe side effects and explained what they are."
2021-02-10 02:13:29,"Thank you for this article.  It is the first I have read about my condition specifically and although I am on a waiting list to receive an appointment for the vaccine, I did contact my Hematologist to ask her about this."
2021-02-10 02:45:56,"I had my first vaccination a week and a half ago, and I still have myalgia, arthralgia, and fatigue that developed within an hour of getting the shot. I know someone who has had these same symptoms for over three weeks.

I’m getting really concerned about getting the second shot. I thought the side effects were only supposed to last for a few days."
2021-02-09 14:54:46,Why the heck would she take a second dose if she knows she's immune-compromised to these kinds of vaccines???
2021-02-10 03:07:54,I have thrombocytopenia due chronic Lyme disease. I get my platelets monitored. Already having this blood disorder it is unpleasant reading this article but I’m in no way not going to get the vaccine as soon as I’m able to find an appointment.
2021-02-10 03:58:13,There’s so much anti vaccination fear inverting in the comments here. Don’t fall victim to it. The vaccine is overwhelmingly safe. There have been very few adverse reactions among the millions who have received the vaccine thus far AND there have been nearly zero covid hospitalizations or deaths among the vaccinated meaning the vaccine works!
2021-02-10 04:27:12,"If something goes wrong, who's going to cleanup the mess? The vaccine court, which has paid out billions in claims, is only available to people that are injured by FDA approved vaccines. Covid vaccines are merely ""authorized"" under an EAU. The Countermeasures Injury Compensation Program is the only place one can go to get help, and they are an obscure underfunded office that mostly denies claims. One thing is for sure; there is no downside for the vaccine manufacturers as they have been indemnified every which way to Sunday. Their research data is proprietary, secret, and mostly unpublished. And despite it all, I'll probably get the vaccine, because my fear of the virus is greater than my good sense."
2021-02-10 05:16:29,"I have thrombocytopenia and have decided against getting either of these vaccines.  two days before i was scheduled to receive the pfizer vaccine, i just happened upon the article on the death of dr. michael of hemorrhagic stroke and took that as a caution to at least wait until more information was available regarding his death.  to my knowledge there is at least one manufacturer, if not more, working on a vaccine that employs the old type formula - a small amount of the virus is introduced so that the body builds up a resistance.  i hope it makes it to market.
i’m in the high risk group due to my age, 77, and hope i don’t contract the virus, but if i do, i’ll deal with that.  i hope and pray that both vaccines are a complete success - i’m just not sure these are the ones for me."
2021-02-10 05:24:31,"This article has raised questions among people with autoimmune system conditions, including myself. According to the CDC website as of December 29, 2020, people with autoimmune conditions may take the mRNA covid vaccines but should be aware of the limited safety data: safety for people with weakened immune systems is not yet available. I will need to hear back from my neurology specialist before taking the vaccine."
2021-02-10 06:28:26,"Since I am bilingual, I make it my duty to read info about covid vaccines side effects from another country that is willing to go public with these findings.

According to their latest report, so far 43% of people who took these mRNA vaccines develop severe side effects."
2021-02-10 07:26:35,So no mention of what was changed in the treatment that helped in Ms. Legaspi’s recovery?
2021-02-10 03:51:38,Since when is 36 recipients a few?
2021-02-10 10:24:35,"I have had chronic immune thrombocytopenia since 2011.  Just prior to receiving my 1st dose of Moderna, my platelet count was dangerously low (16,000).  After consulting with my hematologist, I was given two transfusions of hemoglobin and took prednisone (30mg/day) a week prior to receiving the 1st vaccine as well as starting a new course of meds made by Dova.   I’ve had no serious reactions to the vaccine. At my last blood draw (1/29/21) my platelets had risen to 55,000 and I’m looking forward to getting the second shot on Feb 20th.   So even with a dangerously low count at the time of the 1st Moderna shot, no change in upward progress.  I expect even higher numbers when I see my hematologist next week."
2021-02-10 12:37:05,"A few years ago, I was prescribed Ciprofloxcin for an infection and after 3 doses, my life had changed. I developed a constellation of autoimmune issues, shortly after. For me Cipro is a dangerous drug. But not for most people. For me it is a genetic issue as I did not know that I had several family members damaged by a drug in the same class. I took a year off from nursing school in part to support my children as they learn remotely and part due to the fear of the coronavirus. I got my second dose of the vaccine on Saturday. I was terrified. I cried after my first dose because I truly understood the risks of this vaccine. Yes, I have pains in my body now that weren’t there prior to my first dose, but I would not change a thing and the second dose was dreadful and inflamed my body even more.
But luckily, I feel better every day.
 I hope that with more data, we will learn more about who is at risk for bad outcomes. But this vaccine has given so much hope to me, my father with end stage renal failure and my developmentally handicapped sibling and my partner who is a teacher and many others. In the first world we tend to be  so eager to condemn what folk in other countries would love to have. Take the vaccine if you want to or don’t take it. But I am going to be a nurse in a little over a year because of it, and that is the most hope I have had in a year. I am sorry I had to take such a risk, but it is the best tool available to fight this virus right now."
2021-02-10 13:34:27,"I will be waiting for a traditional vaccine as my sense is that these newer ones were rushed and absolutely NOTHING will get in the way.  This seems like group think 101 especially with doctors alarmingly telling the patients who have already had near fatal reactions to go on and get the second shot. That is absurd.

Watching the adverse reaction reporting system closely, which only captures a fraction of the serious cases. I checked the VAERS system concerned about autoimmune reactions and discovered there are at least 26 documented cases of pericarditis (one in which the ""cardiology team Strongly Believes it is related to the vaccine"").  Pericarditis is often triggered by a virus and/or immune system reaction to it or immune dysfunction in which the body attacks the sac that basically encases the heart."
2021-02-10 13:41:23,"I am a resident physician who has treated probably dozens to a few hundred COVID-19 patients, watching 60% die in the ICU after prolonged courses because their lungs were basically broken trash bags flapping in the wind.  On the floors, about 10 to 20% died. We had multiple cases with family members in the hospital the same time - some recovering, some dying. The scariest patient for me, being a young healthy person, was someone my age, equally athletic, left with chronic fatigue and inability to walk up the stairs after recovering from mild COVID - more plausible and terrifying to me than getting a severe case. I also had a single patient die of thrombocytopenia from brain hemorrhage (a brain bleed). This article doesn’t worry me. My chance of dying of COVID as a young healthy person with no other illnesses was in the vicinity of one in a few thousand. Nobody in the tens of thousands of people in the initial trials of the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines died of COVID, but many of the unvaccinated did. I have seen enough people die with massive COVID related blood clots, or brain bleeds from the anticoagulants we used to prevent them, that I did not hesitate to take possibly a one in a multimillion chance of a rare disease over a one in a few thousand chance of dying of COVID. If rare vaccine side effects scare you, please refresh your memory on what it looks like to suffocate to death. I have seen enough death and disability from COVID - I chose the vaccine and was fine."
2021-02-10 15:19:27,"This article clarifies nothing except that no one knows the long term or immediate effects.  Each ""expert"" has different opinions but ""it's safe to take the vaccine"".  If fear is the enemy then what are articles like this?  They're back and forth.  We have no concrete data except doubt and speculation.  Of course, we don't know alot about the disease or the vaccines in such a short amount of time...but you can't honestly believe that they're safe to take if you already live with the kind of side effects they're pointing out here.  Yes, each person should talk to their doctor who monitors their disease/condition, but ultimately who is to know what the greater risk is?    Instead of offering concrete data or just saying it is possible you can have an adverse reaction, they're saying ""Take it anyway.  You'll be alright... hopefully."".  It takes years to know and collect evidence on the reactions to a vaccine.  We don't have that behind the covid vaccine.  And since the article says both vaccines have been linked to this blood disorder in healthy people, how is not supposed to worry those with thrombocytopenia and autoimmune diseases already?  The only winners are the pharmacuetical companies who don't have to worry about being responsible for those who die or suffer long term effects of their vaccines.  Everyone else just has to roll the dice and hope and pray that their decision to take or not to take the vaccine won't kill them or cause permanent damage to their bodies."
2021-02-10 14:06:33,I am a survivor of thrombocytopenia. Look up heperin induced thrombocytopenia. Happened during a triple bypass.Skin started rotting off ! Thankfully i recovered .
2021-02-10 14:20:41,"If there are 36 cases reported, the reports tend to be 1% of the reality, so that means approx 3600 cases so far."
2021-02-10 16:32:51,"Unless they know what a person’s medical status is before taking the vaccine it is nearly impossible to know whether the body’s response to it was caused by the vaccine or revealed by it. Many people harbor the Epstein Barr virus without ever knowing it, along with many variants of HPV. What of undiagnosed cases of diseases like Lupus? Undiagnosed early stage Multiple Sclerosis? It is highly likely that the vaccine revealed disease that people already had but the immune response caused a faster disease progression."
2021-02-10 17:46:07,"Denominators are important, and help the public better understand the likely risk attributable to a medical intervention (in this case, the vaccine).   A quick perusal of the medical literature indicates the annual incidence (number of new cases) of immune thrombocytopenia in the US from all causes is between 30 and 60 per million adults.  Thus far, it appears somewhat more than 1 per million vaccinated have developed this condition.  While the time course of symptom onset appropriately gives a prudent hematologist a high index of suspicion that the vaccine may contribute to the symptoms, one must exercise caution in making this attribution, as the expected annual number of cases of immune thrombocytopenia in the population - vaccinated or not - may be 30 times as high."

2021-02-10 22:16:28,"It seems to me the authorities don't have a plan for people  who develop adverse reactions such as an autoimmune disease after taking the covid vaccine.

This type of adverse reactions to vaccines is not new.  

Why aren't they better prepared especially after the death of the doctor in Florida?  Why their first reaction is to always dismiss it?"
2021-02-10 21:32:58,"They would like everyone to take vaccines some based on new technologies to get us out of the current situation.

So far it seems like,  if you took the vaccines and develop a rare disease, you are practically on your own.  You don't even know what to look for if you run into trouble.  The lady with the vaginal bleeding is a perfect example.  

I hope everyone understands why some in the Black community are hesitant to take these vaccines given their experience with the medical system.  Would you receive prompt, good medical care?  Who is going to foot the bill?  Would you get the same care as someone who is not Black?  Would the care you receive depends on your ability to pay and how good is your insurance?"

I was at home for months more.  I was treated with prednisone.  I lived.  I am 72 now.  I have had breast cancer, and non Hodgkin lymphoma.  I am obese.

My question to  the drug company or any one who might know.  Should I get the vaccine next month and hope that thrombocytopenia won’t kill me before covid 19 will.   There are no phone limes or people to ask.  Can any of you or someone at Phyzer advise me.  This is a life or death question.  My life or my death."

I frankly do not care so much about the motivations of these countries to send vaccines as the action of sending them itself.  And that is what people in these countries may see too. It is called medical diplomacy and it is just  fine with me--better than profiting from the vaccines, restricting them,  or hoarding them. Actions speak louder than words."
2021-02-11 23:16:26,"The article has a deep digress and dived into a sub-standard level  in its content and presentation. 
During my school days at a Holy Cross Convent in sixties in a small town in Tamil Nadu, I could see the containers of milk powder and soya beans oil made in USA from the CARE (Cooperative for American Relief Everywhere). Poor children in the school have been fed with milk and food to prevent dropouts from the schools.
 India, the world's largest democracy has been blessed with the unfathomable service of a lot of Christian missionaries on Health & Education on the advent of Europeans to India.
It is the other side of the coin by the advent of the Europeans to India. When the developed nations give aid in the form of money, food, and life -saving drugs to many under developed or developing nations, one can't dub it as a quid pro quo  attempt or paint it as a  diplomacy to placate the political support or an attempt to establish their super power status.

 When the world nations had put pressure on India to supply HCQ in 2020, India acted in an impartial manner by ensuring its uninterrupted supply chain to all nations.
 

When America has poor citizens sans home or shelters, giving aid to build homes and shelters to the affected by 
 natural calamities overseas shouldn't be deemed as a political tool. 

India is made of the theme, ""unity in diversity"" and always practicing  the principle of "" All lives on the earth must be preserved "" through the concept of ""Live and Let Live""."
2021-02-11 23:17:15,"In a complicated world, I find it hard to sort through the moral hierarchy here, but I am pleasantly surprised increasing amounts of vaccines are going to poor countries, whatever the giving motivations. Assuming the effectiveness data is solid.
Can anyone come up with a better-to-less better-to worse way to look at whether a manufacturing country should do this?
How should the Biden Administration do?"
2021-02-11 23:42:58,"Vivian: you state: “India, China, the U.A.E. and others dole out donations in countries where they seek sway. In some cases, they are sending doses despite pressing needs at home”. 

But then, when we dig into the details we find that India is giving away vaccines that it cannot use, and we all know that China has already got the virus under control (and yet you lump it under a description of countries with “pressing needs at home”). You have made false equivalences and your underlying point is shown to be false by the evidence you provided. So can we assume that this is yet another hit job based on prejudice?

Shame on you NYT editors."
2021-02-11 22:55:58,"This article is such a transparent attempt to foment conflict between India and China. By the same deluded reasoning, when Germany develops a vaccine, they must be aiming to undercut American soft power abroad by ""stealing their charity"". Oh please.

While the authors provide some small indication of “bad faith generosity” on the part of India, no evidence is given on the part of China. This is actually bad faith reporting and is something that I have come to expect when the NYT reports on China (and many countries that we know little about), and especially Vivian Yee regarding China. And then we learn that India has more vaccines than it can use, so this generosity is fundamentally positive and yet the authors continue with their snide assumptions. Sigh...

Let us not forget that China essentially has the virus under control and that the greatest risk to the world is more dangerous mutations.  Seen in this light China’s strategy is both humanitarian and good for China.

Please, take a step back and review your underlying assumptions. You mention “Xi Jinping thought”, but never explain what it is. Might it actually be a positive philosophy? We are never told - we are just left to assume that it is a problem, and the context makes your negative assumptions clear. And are you assuming that *all* foreign aid is self-serving, or do you simply give the US a free pass? Margaret Thatcher’s foreign aid strategy was unashamedly self-serving, and came with strings attached that *required* the recipients to buy British. Both Japanese and US aid is similar. And yet this is not the case with this Chinese aid. Why is this not the story?"

When India, China or any non-Western country does it, it’s diplomacy.

Ok I see"
2021-02-11 23:54:34,"China and India are both much more diplomatic strategic and wise about deterring, defeating and diminishing COVID-19's infectious deadly impact on lesser developed nations in Africa, Americas ahd Asia by sharing their vaccines.

No nation has done worse domestically and internationally in dealing with COVID-19 infections and deaths than Donald John Trump's America. Neither America's allies nor foes have any reliance nor respect for America's COVID-19's vaccine efforts."
2021-02-11 23:32:02,"So, when a country doesn't share it's available vaccine, it's considered selfish. When they do share, it's called out as being done to gain control. Depending on which country you are talking about, you can spin it the bad way no matter what.

The headline says 'India giving away vaccine.....even when there are pressing needs at home'. But, buried in the midst of the article, it does note that 'the Serum Institute's production capacity is more than what India can consume at the moment'. And, this didn't happen by accident. Serum Institute has made a huge investment, and has been preparing for the past year or more for this time. And, they are able to produce enough to be able to share with other countries. Isn't that a great thing? However, these journalists seem find a sinister motive to everything."
2021-02-12 00:03:05,"What India is doing is true charity.
They are not donating vaccines from what they can spare.
They are donating even though they themselves are in desperate need. I'd call that a gift from the heart, rather than dismiss it as just ""vaccine diplomacy"", even though this deed has certainly boosted India's soft power.

Compare that to us (the US) and Canada, who are actually hoarding."
2021-02-12 00:21:21,"It is important to emphasize that providing vaccines to poor & under-developed countries is CRUCIAL FOR ALL OF US. If North American and Western Europe succeed in vaccinating their people but the virus travels through Brazil or Uganda unimpeded, that large pool of people will be incubators for 'escape' variants like - or worse than - the South African strain. And those variants will spread. Making it necessary to update the vaccines. And so it will continue."
2021-02-12 00:31:27,"Seriously, NYT? Seek sway, that is the only reason? By that reasoning, Germany was seeking sway when BioNTech did the research? 
Consider this, not everything is always power play. There are cultural forces at work too. The Eastern thought of charity is different, it is to give even when the giver has needs. It is true that Serum Institute has excess capacity to produce. But India could have just sold it too, right? 200 mil doses at $5 each would be a billion. Not a small sum for a developing country. It CHOSE to donate. If goodwill comes from it, so be it, what makes you so sure that that the main motivation? 
NYT, examine your biases. Realize that countries other than in the west are capable of charity and competence for once. If covid has not proved it already for you, nothing ever will."
2021-02-12 00:31:24,"I find myself at a loss of words. If countries hoard vaccines, they are labelled apathetic, selfish. If you send out vaccines, your motives are questioned.

I think India is doing much better than a lot of countries. It has vaccinated more people than a lot of developed countries. E.g. India has vaccinated more people than France has. Inspite of this, India is still able to send vaccines outside. Please appreciate that."
2021-02-12 00:22:31,"I smell antiIndia sentiments in most NYT articles whether it is its vaccine donation to poor countries, farmer's agitation funded by Canadians or recent floods and breakdown of hydro electricity plants. The reporting is so one sided it makes me wonder about the ulterior intent. Talking about vaccines there is no mention about how many vaccines USA and western countries have given/ donated to poor countries and how successful India is in controlling spread of Covid 19. I get the pulse of average Indians through local news papers and media. I am proud to say I have not seen a single news even the opposition parties crying about vaccine donation to poor countries. So some comments in your article is a news to me from a humanity of 1.3 billion. I do not see anything wrong if it used for diplomatic sway because vaccine is not a weapon that kills people it saves people. NYT also confidently forget that India is a pharmacy for the poor people of the world whether it is malaria or AIDS or Covid19 for that matter. Remember India always stand by with humanity  in every disaster that it does not create."

Truth is, these are feel good spin articles for Americans. What’s actually true and fair doesn’t matter anymore."
2021-02-12 01:35:56,"Interesting report. There is one major difference between the two that this report does not mention: China does not face urgency of vaccination as it has successfully controlled infections. India on the other hand, has a huge and urgent domestic needs. So India's strategic motivation of sending vaccine overseas is stronger than that of China's. Besides, China has three domestically developed vaccines now available and two joint productions with BioNtech and Astrozeneca soon will be available. While both countries play ""vaccine diplomacy"", India's disregard for domestic needs is more striking."
2021-02-12 01:44:04,"The Biden administration secured enough vaccines to jab 300 million people multiple times, vaccines which are not to be used for children below 18yrs.  Instead of criticizing them, we have an article on  India and China and why they are supplying vaccines to poor countries in the world.

Don’t get me wrong, behind this noble quest, India and China are hoping to create more friendly relations with other countries be it in trade or other reasons.  But at least instead of supplying weapons these are countries are supplying medical aid."
2021-02-12 01:29:40,Because they care for all human beings.  US or Pakistan will not do that.  They are for themselves.  They only make judgement for other countries.

The American taxpayers are paying for this it does not do us justice shipping them to foreigners while our people are dying more than any other country. I am sure no one will mind sharing once we have enough doses for ourselves until then we should not be giving a single dose to any country. Call me cold blooded or selfish but I care about my fellow citizens.
2021-02-12 02:12:30,"While vaccination diplomacy may be one factor at work, please remember that the populations of South Asia are deeply intertwined by culture, religion and migration. When India went into lockdown last March, hundreds of thousands of workers returned to neighboring countries (bringing COVID-19 with them). These same workers are returning to India. And others will travel to India for studying, trade and other affairs.  Whether Intentionally or not, India is protecting itself by sharing the vaccine with its neighbors."
2021-02-12 02:19:39,"Observer research foundation fellow quoted in the article seems grossly misinformed who is bent on criticizing for criticism sake. India has more vaccine supply than vaccine takers. Infection and death rates are down substantially, people lost the urge to get vaccinated. India is doing the right thing by supplying vaccines to neighbors and allies both for diplomacy and to reiterate its role as a reliable partner to provide critical medicines."
2021-02-12 03:35:35,"Perhaps, India and China genuinely believe in sharing their vaccine manufacturing capabilities to help the world. What a contrast with respect to many rich counties!"
2021-02-12 07:29:40,"India is trying to build goodwill in citizens in neighboring countries. Reading  this good will as a vaccine diplomacy as less the altruistic act is reprehensible. Sri Lanka , Nepal and Bangladesh have outstanding  unresolved issues with India which is not going to change by donating vials of vaccine. Donations are forgotten as soon as need is not there."
2021-02-12 10:20:55,"Would you rather we hoarded vaccines? We do have nearly 1.5 billion people. Nothing will ever be enough to spare. 

And our domestic needs while important are certainly not as drastic as in a country that stands at 475,000 deaths (and counting) and is particularly prone to commenting adversely to anything India does currently. 

""Indians are dying"" - of course we are, but it so happens we lose more to traffic accidents annually than we have lost to this disease. And we are not exactly sitting on our hands about either causes by the way.

We ship out, we should do better for our own (As compared to whom? Who is not seeing subsequent waves? And please don't compare against tiny little island nations.).

We don't ship out and pull an India-First, then ""Yet another sign of rising nationalism! And now strangling world health.""

Besides, many Indians are still skeptical of the vaccines, yet others feel that they already have the antibodies so don't need vaccines. Until such time everyone's on board and everyone must be vaccinated, why not do what we can globally? Make money in some places. Build goodwill in others."

2021-02-12 12:06:37,"There is no moral superiority here, the serum institute of India is the world’s largest vaccine factory, churns out the AstraZeneca-Oxford vaccine at a daily rate of about 2.5 million doses, so India has an obligation to help its neighbors and India can do it.
   If India is not helping those countries, does the USA or UK is willing to help them? it is also admirable that India is doling out those vaccines free of charge to its neighbors."
2021-02-12 03:21:16,"The parallelism between India and China is a dangerous ignorance. Surely India is trying to gain diplomatic muscle to counter Chinese hegemony, but India has never been an aggressor to other nations sovereignty.  
On the other hand, Chinese debt trap has forced other nations under Sino-colonialism. China constantly flips international rules, regulations and norms to intrude at least 10 different countries.

The diplomatic game in the name of vaccine is obvious but I would take Indian vaccine rather than trap myself in Chinese CCP administered bait."
2021-02-12 03:27:30,"Many Indians refuse the vaccine! They believe, rightly or wrongly, that they have some form of natural immunity that is derived from their vegetarian diet, lifestyle and/or environment. This may well be true, and could just as equally be wrong. There is no evidence to support that belief! However, this leaves many vaccine doses available to other countries who could use the vaccine!"
2021-02-12 12:04:14,"While I think President Biden has been doing a great job thus far - even though it will take a lot more to undo Trump's willful damages to this country - his ordering of an additional 200 million doses of COVID vaccine from Pfizer and Moderna (J&J's has not been approved yet) probably has a diplomatic mission in mind, either through the State Department or via COVAX.

To be clear, I am all for it. COVID is a global epidemic, hence pandemic; therefore, no one is safe until everyone is safe. Just look at the UK's, South African and Brazilian variants. The SARSCoV2 novel coronavirus doesn't care about national borders. Its primary mission is to spread itself, by hooks or by mutations. So, it is about humanity versus it."
2021-02-12 04:27:38,"If we don’t help the poorer countries with vaccine supplies - we will inherit a variant from them that will come back to haunt us. Look at the South African variant as a case in point.

2021-02-12 19:09:23,"Not sure what to think about this, but not surprised at all.  Donating the vaccine to areas that are not capable of manufacturing their own is something, I would think, that we would celebrate.  We need to help our own citizens, all countries do, but we also need to provide those vulnerable access to vaccine.  What would happen if we just horded it?  While this may be driven by geopolitical politics, and everything is these days, it helps people live.  It's a good thing."

The main statistic mentioned, death rate among intubated Covid patients, could easily be biased by the differences in the patient population -- in other words, patients who are closer to death to begin with.

Over the years it became THE community hospital and like many public hospitals, the first stop for poor residents and often underfunded.   Without the clout of bigger, often teaching hospitals with state of the art and high tech equipment, they offer more care but less state of the art programs and technology, and expertise.

the large, highly specialized institutions require a large population base, often in the millions to afford the level of specialization they offer.  And in this pandemic, those services are often overloaded.  Getting in is more lottery than reason; more where one's primary doctor is affiliated than patient need; and yes, who will or can pay."
2021-02-08 12:41:40,"While it is truly tragic and unfair that hospitals in predominantly minority areas are relatively substandard, here’s what’s frustrating to me: why it seems minority populations aren’t taking or can’t implement relatively inexpensive measures for reducing virus transmission.  Then I realized, we, in our cozy middle and upper class environs, don’t have a clue of the living situations of lower-income people.  

You have multiple generations of people coming in and out of cramped living quarters.  Some exhausted from working multiple jobs.  Most have little choice but to be in close quarters outside of the home with others in similar situations.

Low-income neighborhoods are getting hammered from multiple fronts: Virus-friendly living situations; distrust of our health care profession AND substandard medical care.

The scary thing is there is no fast-track solution for a situation years (maybe decades) in the making.

As with our Native-American population: mass extermination.  This is the face of racism."

2021-02-08 13:00:09,"I lost my dad to COVID on January 28th.  As much so as the bad practice itself, these types of hospitals tend to make these patients faceless, homogenous numbers, as though they aren't real humans and real hearts being broken.  My father, before he died, was afraid to eat anything because he would have to go to the bathroom, and he was afraid of ""getting in trouble,"" for soiling himself.  

Nobody talks about the ache of a loved one dying alone in an over-lighted hospital room, with obnoxious beeping in the background, but it's a death with no compassion, no individuation, no love.  
 
A small gift that these hospitals could give their families is the ability to at least see their loved ones before they pass, to hold their hands, to say ""I love you.""  I know many still have the virus in their system as they are dying, but it is a risk most family members would be willing to take, just to say goodbye, and to give their loved ones a better death."
2021-02-08 13:03:38,"Covid-19 might, just might be the straw that finally breaks the back of America's failed healthcare 'system.'
What goes unsaid in this piece (which is excellent) is the thousands, upon thousands of dollars these 'high tech' treatments cost and 'insurance' does not pay.
Healthcare expenses have long been the major source of bankruptcies in America. I fear they will skyrocket into the stratosphere over the coming months and years as a result of Covid-19. Even in death you will not escape the bill collector and the families of the deceased are those left holding the bag while grieving their loss."
2021-02-08 12:58:10,"Lots to unpack as they say. Health insurance is not health care. It is a program of administering costs (prepayment in the form of premiums) to protect against non-payment of accounts. The fact certain social segments of our communities are reluctant to miss church, compelled to be present at work, hesitant to seek clinical treatment early and even morbidly fatalistic (as Mexicans are wont) compounds the general viral spread and mortality effect of COVID19. Uneven resources, practices and triage among hospitals is astoundingly absurd. And finally, the fact mortuaries cannot ‘process’ the beloveds’ remains in an expedient manner is without excuse. That aspect is quite manageable for certain."
2021-02-08 12:38:33,"While totally unacceptable, we must not forget the other lessons of COVID.  We must change our food system, health system and our attitudes.  With the exception of nursing homes, throughout this crisis we have learned that those who are obese and unhealthy or have chosen to ignore quarantine rules and continued to have family gatherings and go to church have shoulder the burden of COVID.  Fixing our health care system is essential, but moving to a more healthy society and one that respects the seriousness of health warnings is critical."
2021-02-08 12:49:04,Why other commenters identify Medicare for all as a solution is baffling. One of the men had employer based insurance. And the payor source of the other man is not identified. What struck me was the mention of a room mate. For a patient with a serious infectious disease! For a patient on multiple monitors struggling to stay alive! MLK was clearly built as a community hospital to handle simpler medical problems. It is not a tertiary care center like Cedars or UCLA med.
2021-02-08 13:27:12,"I am so sorry that this happened to these families. Sorry, but not surprised. For other families who find themselves in a similar situation with a sick relative, if at all possible, skip the ambulance and have someone drive the patient to an ER on ""the other side of town."" Whether insured or not, the hospital must provide emergency treatment. If they insist on transferring the patient to another, less equipped hospital after emergency treatment has been administered, REFUSE and insist that they admit and treat the patient at their current hospital! In California no patient can be forced to leave a hospital without either their, or their family's consent. It's a shame that someone may have to resort to this strategy in order to receive the best care available, but until we change the for-profit system and provide healthcare care for all, knowing and strongly advocating for your rights may mean the difference between life and death."
2021-02-08 12:53:54,"The saddest part of all was the role of religion. What is the point of going to a service to worship in the midst of a pandemic? Whatever the words spoken, the church served essentially as a death cult, adding to the misery and straining the fragile threads of America's bare pathetic safety net. The Supreme Court is complicit in the senseless elevation of religion over the common good. The country awaits salvation, or Armageddon. It is easier than facing reality and doing something about it."

For starters, while people are returning to restaurants, attending the Super Bowl, and demanding that schools reopen, there's this level of emergency and gravity going on, with drowning health care workers at their wit's ends, short of resources, and families waiting their turn in a two to three month backlog of bodies, to put their loved ones to rest.

And then, I don't know the right word to use, but barbaric comes to mind, to describe this system that decides that the best care will not go to such fine and beloved people."
2021-02-08 13:27:50,"The COVID problem is worse with overcrowding and this is seen with economic distress.  The article seems to imply that we citizens should feel bad and do something.  I agree. We need to address the root cause of the economic distress.  The root cause is that the US is taking in masses of poor people from south of the border.  To solve this problem the US might want to consider taking a holiday from migration for a few years until we can provide decent housing and a decent standard of living for those already here like those portrayed in the article.  Until every poor person has a job paid with a living wage, decent retirement, and decent health insurance, for example, it is simply wrong to take in more and more people.  An argument can be made that the US can afford it. No doubt. But I have seen no evidence that our government has placed caring for people and hte society here as it most important job. We have a runaway defense budget and a corrupt and indecent tax system so of course we can't fund a social safety net.  And neither party seems to want to enforce Everify and punish employers who hire undocumented workers which tells me that neither party is serious about taking care of US citizens and neither party really wants a social safety net. This is especially true regarding black Americans.  The politicians are bought and articles like htis don't focus on the root cause.....campaign finance."

I've often used the argument that dealing with Covid patients is  expensive ..and even if they have underlying conditions..,it's the Virus that does them in. If someone smoked 5 packs a day for decades and had lung and heart issues....and they were shot and died...would the cause of death be smoking or...gun shot wound??....There hasn't been anyone who's denied that many more Americans would die if we didn't follow the mandated shutdowns and masking etc requirements. Not one person arguing for opening up etc,,,would volunteer to work at a hospital intensive care unit or work at a morgue or funeral home !!

I believe Trump was responsible for the US’ exceptionally poor response to the pandemic, but let’s not forget how religious leaders also completely abandoned their duty to lead. 

It is inconceivable to me that so many encouraged their faithful to put themselves and others at risk—at a time when unimaginable resources are available so that worshipping together is still possible—and even fought in the courts for the right to hold spreader events."

In NY if you want to sign up for a vaccination you have to go through a checklist of people who are more deserving because they are most disadvantaged or at the highest risk of infection hence they get to move to the front of the line. By the time I was allowed to sign up (65 ) hundreds of thousands had already signed up and received their first shot. I still am unable to even put my name on a list. Anyone and everyone who work in hospitals from doctors to the janitorial staff and other health-care industries, and teachers (regardless of race or economic status of these people) should be prioritized. But for everyone else vaccinations should be available first come/first served. 
I’m a 68-year old retired teacher and calculated that during my tenure I paid about a quarter of a million dollars in taxes; and I’m still waiting for a vax. I’m not claiming I should get special privileges. But somehow I wound up at the back of the line."
2021-02-08 14:04:11,"In reading this I don't think the hospital or the people who cared for these two men are to blame. We've been told since last February to stay home and avoid gatherings to avoid getting the disease. We've been told that it was especially important that people with underlying health conditions, like obesity, hypertension and diabetes, avoid getting the disease because of the likelihood for poor outcomes. We've been warned that not staying home and not wearing masks may put cities in a situation where healthcare systems are overwhelmed and difficult choices (like withholding dialysis from someone in favor of giving it to another person)  would have to be made. Everything that played out in this story played out exactly as Fauci and others warned a year ago: vulnerable people circulated with others; they got very sick; because of their existing vulnerabilities they declined rapidly to the point that treatment options were limited; the healthcare system they accessed was overwhelmed; they died. I am not trying to blame the victims. Just trying to point out that this is what ""stay home, save lives"" was supposed to prevent. (Withholding ECMO from people because ""we don't like their insurance"" is a whole other story and obviously that needs to be investigated.)

I agree it is past time for universal health care. It's also past time for people to realize no one is safe from this disease and to stay home and go to a video church service in their home rather than gather with others."

But the writer glosses over the minister who encouraged attending services in person and he must share part of the blame for one of the deaths.  The writer also implies that this is a problem created by our medical system.  But people died in England with a comprehensive socialized medical system.  Extracorporeal circulatory assist is expensive and complicated to administer:not available in large numbers in every country, including the US.

Don’t many people with those medical conditions die from Covid? Regardless of ethnicity or whether their ICU doctor went to Stanford?  I don’t see how better hospitals or more health insurance or less mistrust of doctors treats an incurable disease.  (Or is there a secret cure that only white obese people with diabetes and high blood pressure get - if there is, please tell me!)

Trump administration amply demonstrated how dangerous it is not to have such nationwide healthcare, effectively abandoning so many people to their own wits and resources. Most Covid-19 fatalities in U.S. were absolutely preventable. This is a moral failure. 

Experts warn the possibility of another pandemic in a decade or so due to the on-going destruction of environment which compels us to interact with wild life and nature even more.

Many could avoid sharing the pain of their neighbors both literal and figurative. Allowed them to deny inconvenient truth and now even as they get sick denial is so entrenched,some deny it's Covid. We are now a visual people. In an era of video conferences, YouTube, and TikTok we needed to see things for them to be real. From the early days we should have been blaring these images of the wards, the dead and all the misery for all to see in all media formats. I had this discussion with my husband last springl when he was working on a  Covid Unit at a local hospital and as virus denial was spreading through much of the country. I argued that no matter how many news articles or stories on cable the visuals as raw as possible needed to be seen widely and frequently, on traditional media and social media,to find people where they happen to be. It should have been promoted by social media algorithms for all to see, again and again. Given the political situation extreme measures were needed to counteract the lies. Imagery is now more common thankfully but attitudes are hardened.It may be to late, but I'm still grateful to the families that allow us to share their pain. Thank you Mrs Guerrero."

The ""unequal""?  Well, those in LA county who are educated and believe in science will (i) have used masks/distanced/stayed home and (ii) possibly sought health care early in their symptoms start.  Mr. Virgen ignored all the self-help-to-stay-healthy information and relied on his faith (and not science).

The ""separate""?  Well, those who are U.S. citizens and contribute to the pool of health-care-insured will have the greatest choices for receiving health care in the U.S.  Mr. Flores was not a  U.S. citizen.

A NYTimes review of LA county's hospital ICU situation of today shows that most of the hospitals in that county are at or very-near capacity, including Cedars-Sinai Medical Center.

As usual, comparing hospitals' death rates, services, populations served, etc. -- as if often the case when journalists choose to write comparisons of Haves and Have Nots -- is not all that useful because, as is the case here, they are so-often not Fair and Balanced reports.   What would that have looked like here possibly?  A similar/companion report of the goings on in a hospital with 96% insured patients and covid outcomes.  That's just an example.

Meanwhile, a huge proportion of their fellow citizens completely ignored all precautions.

It's as if a bunch of people ran around setting fires while FDNY was responding on 9/11.

Last year critically ill covid patients were sent to overwhelmed public hospitals in Queens resulting in inordinately high deaths and the same can be said on a daily basis across the U.S.

 Poorer, minority communities are to often ""medical deserts"" with no or little primary care physicians and medical resources. Many of the patients here suffered from high blood pressure, obesity and diabetes, conditions that cry out for accessible medical care .  Society should be entitled to a health care system that provides all its members access to decent care that allocates resources fairly and rationally.

if going to a general hospital nearby town signifies loss of income .

A public health system not only a mirror reflecting a society’s social and income strata , it let’s you know its bare essentials about life and its “ values “ ..."

2021-02-08 15:26:39,"Many on the NYT comments wonder about the cost of illegal “immigration”. This story highlights part of it. 

The LA Times has reported that a third of LA County residents are here illegally. Poorly educated, low earning, forced to live in undersized housing by LA’s high housing costs, they have been especially hard hit by Covid 19.

They went into it in poor health. The CDC has been warning for decades that Hispanic people have a 50% lifetime risk of becoming diabetic. Note the comorbidities in this story.

All of this is terribly sad. The Federal, state and local policies that produce this kind of immigration and resulting tragedy should be our focus."
2021-02-08 15:11:12,"This story isn’t only about a thoroughly broken US healthcare system, but the fact that we have divided up people by class in just about every aspect of American life.  As a middle-class kid, I can remember when — for just a few bucks more — you could get one of the better seats at Yankee Stadium or a Broadway show.  Now, unless you’re prepared to shell out three or four figures for a “VIP” admission, you go to the back of the line.

Poor and working-class Hispanic-Americans don’t usually become big donors to renowned medical centers.  That’s why they are shuttled off to die at places such as MLK.  It’s the American way, which is all about the $$$$."

2021-02-08 15:13:49,"Single payer health coverage for all makes common sense.  It has nothing to do with ""socialism"".  Much like those shouting ""freedom"" while charging  the Capitol.  Just ill-conceived sloganeering.
We here in Canada have the benefits of universal health coverage.  We do not consider ourselves ""socialists""  whatever that term might mean to you.  Then there is the other lie that universal health coverage precludes additional private insurance.  My wife and I  have an additional private plan for $219  (USD$171) a month for the two of us.  It covers (80%) for services such as massage, acupuncture, chiropractor, optometrist, eyeglasses etc and many drugs not covered under the provincial plan.  It also provides us with excellent travel insurance which at our ages saves us several thousands if bought separately.
President Obama made a historic breakthrough with the ACA. He deserves the kudos. But it was a compromise.  Inasmuch as it leaves too much power in the hands of insurance companies it is seriously compromised.  Medicare for all is far superior to an employer based system.  The pandemic should have made that abundantly clear.
We hope you pay heed to Senator Sanders and not dismiss his plan arbitrarily."
2021-02-08 15:16:33,Why are we surprised that people with nothing get inferior care compared to people with lots of money and great insurance benefits?  At least some of us understand that inequality is an unchangeable feature of a country who accepts so many immigrants.

Second-although the point of the article is the disparate medical care between low income and other neighborhoods, again, folks, this is a PANDEMIC. There are comments that assume that UCLA or Harbor would have had the room to take patients if their insurance status were different, but we do not know this. It has been known since the beginning of the pandemic that there would be an incredible strain on hospitals trying to care for all the ill covid patients. This is just what was predicted."

2021-02-08 15:29:27,"I have been waiting for an article like this with all of the very realistic, but very necessary, pictures.  This is a medical tragedy on the order of the New Orleans hospital that Dr. Fink reported on during the Katrina disaster.  It tells the story of two medical systems in the United States--one for the poor and one for the better off.  In my mind, Dr. Elaine Batchlor is a heroine.  When she was interviewed on an NPR program she said that she had noted from newly available statistics that M.L.K., Jr., Hospital had proportionately many more Covid cases than hospitals in L.A. County three or four times its size.  Patients and their families may want to go to Cedars-Sinai but it is clear what type of patients are served by hospitals like that.  And even the health sciences centers seem to show a preference for patients with private or commercial insurance.  Hospitals like M.L.K., Jr., are left to deal with a horrific disaster.  According to the NPR program, Dr. Batchor, after reviewing the statistics, called the Governor's office.  He and a team visited the hospital and then he asked her what he could do.  I never found out because the NPR program suddenly switched direction.  I think I have my answer now."
2021-02-08 15:26:56,This piece deserves to be placed on the desk of every congressperson and senator ... it is hard to believe that that is the state of health care in America in 2021; the state of medical insurance and the tragic unfairness of poverty.  There were beds and treatments elsewhere but not for these people.
2021-02-08 16:02:55,"It occurs to me that the following situation was typical of many hospitals in NYC during the early spring of 2020. This is one reason that Cuomo sent stabilized Covid patients to nursing homes. The refusal of the Comfort to accept any Covid patients at first is another. Although people will still be raging at him about it forever.

""On one Friday afternoon, the 29-bed emergency room was packed with 104 patients, 44 of whom had been admitted and were lining hallways or in outdoor tents awaiting beds in the I.C.U. or medical wards. Patients had been stuck in the emergency department for up to two weeks"""
2021-02-08 16:09:04,"The sad truth is that hospital care is not equal across the board. Just as doctors, not everybody can be above average.

Some hospitals are very limited as they attend to the poor and Medicaid crowd. Others might be Medicare and private insurance crowd-oriented but might be for profit and might not offer the best care to all, though often the most expensive care. 

Even in our hallowed best hospitals here in MA some departments and floors are much better than others. 

Money has lots to do with it but it is not all of it. Still, if you can pick, make sure you have insurance and you select a large academic medical center, usually in an expensive neighborhood."
2021-02-08 15:43:45,"Looking at some of the comments here, you would think that covid came to the US because of our immigration policies. Unbelievable, and not so. In fact, under the prior administration, we sent a lot of people back to Central America without even testing them for covid. Nice gift from the North, eh?"
2021-02-08 15:58:55,"A couple of facts alluded to but not explicit:

Illegal “immigrants” can’t get Obamacare with a subsidy. Many have no health insurance. They can’t enroll in Medicaid (called Medi-Cal in California) so they don’t get routine care. They ARE covered by Medicaid in emergencies (and to have kids, by the way). But Medicaid in California (and a lot of other states) doesn’t pay doctors or hospitals very well, so many providers will not accept it.

This explains the “separate and not equal”."

My heart goes out to all families of Covid-19 victims, but here in this story you have illustrated  a clear indication why Hispanic communities are are suffering far more than all other areas of the county. 

Choosing to attend a storefront church despite dire warnings and state prohibitions is in the scope of this crisis, not only an extremely stupid thing to do personally, but an action that shows no regard for his loved ones, his neighbors and someone who might have the misfortune of being infected with Covid-19 for no other reason than passing by the infected person in a public place like a market or Home Depot, etc.

I'm sorry, but for evangelicals of any color, any race to purposely ignore medical facts of life and death along with  his or her humanitarian responsibilities and justify it as an act of personal faith, as the minister apparently did and encouraged his flock to do the same, is nothing more than ""Playing God""."
2021-02-08 16:00:02,"While any suffering is heartbreaking, in asserting that the hospitals are “separate and unequal” you don’t ask the natural questions as to what level of care the US should be expected to provide for non-citizens like these, and whether hospitals’ being overrun with undocumented workers is in fact driving or exacerbating the “unequal” care available for American citizens."
2021-02-08 15:44:07,"You’d think that after reading this article the majority of Americans would clamor for national healthcare, Medicare for all, or whatever you want to call a health system that EVERYONE has equal access to great healthcare, regardless of race, age, or gender, and no one is turned away if they can’t pay.

The United States is an embarrassment when it comes to healthcare.

2021-02-08 15:51:34,"Not all county hospitals, located in poor areas of town are like  MLK in LA. Consider San Francisco General Hospital which serves the indigent and is a branch the the medical school at the University of California San Francisco. SFGH is located in a very low income, very Latinex neighborhood. In the 1970's in was acclaimed to have pioneered critical care for trauma patients; it was the best hospital for the ambulance to deliver you to, in the event of a traffic accident or a gun shot wound. It was also famous for its work as the epicenter in the emerging HIV/AIDS epidemic in San Francisco.  I was newly impressed with SFGH  when I provided primary care at a street clinic about a mile away. SFGH had aligned with this non-profit clinic and we had the benefit of their excellent software and medical records. This link was crucial for outpatient/inpatient care.

I'm sure this hospital is better funded than MLK in LA, but its reputation for excellence likely accounts for it's ability to attract donations. A wing of the hospital is now named after the Zuckerbergs."

2021-02-08 15:51:47,"There is a little mentioned issue related to this story of failing care, that being the elimination of direct admit to a hospital. Such is almost non-existent now. 
My cancer ridden daughter, who is a cornucopia of medical issues, is told to go to the emergency room when she has a health crisis. We request a direct admit, which her doctor agrees to though only at an adjacent women's hospital, not the main building. Her care there is excellent since there are few patients on the floor due to elective surgeries being delayed. I am often the only visitor on the floor. I wear a mask and a wristband while in the facility, even in her room. 
She was recently hospitalized for 6 days. She would not have survived in the larger, overwhelmed hospital without the level of care she received. 
Direct admit saved her life. But always, the first directive is to go to the emergency room. I do not know why this is so, but it is a big component of our national healthcare crisis."
2021-02-08 16:14:19,"This had to have been an extremely difficult article to write and photograph. In addition to gaining the trust of the families, there’s also gaining access to the hospital, putting oneself at risk, doing the research to uncover all the data and doing additional interviews. And the photos - so wrenching. That takes a toll on the photographer. 

She kudos to the journalists - and a huge thanks to the families who allowed such a personal story to be told and therefore also exposed themselves to the criticism laid bare in many of the comments.

I, too, am incredibly frustrated and angered by people who think the “blood of Jesus” will protect them, or that it was “their time to go.” In doing so, they risk not only themselves, but families and strangers. 

I live in a state full of anti-maskers, with government officials who keep churches open, and people who want to go to church, bars or sporting events so badly that they disregard warnings.

But this article in my mind also highlights the need for much more public health and outreach, including in communities where English is not spoken. Maybe we could/can change minds. Public health has been woefully underfunded. Thanks again to the reporters and families for this story."

Moreover, I'm a proponent of universal health care here in the US.  

Everyone should take a close look at the photos accompanying this article.  They prove beyond doubt that patients in MLK hospital are afforded access to a level of health care that they would never receive in the vast majority of public hospitals anywhere else in the world.  

Mr. Flores and Mr. Virgen died not because they were transported to a public hospital or received sub-standard care at MLK.  They died because they contracted COVID-19 by failing to take precautions recommended by CDC and legislated by the governments of the state and county in which they lived.  They failed to seek early treatment and ultimately died because of comorbidities that are known to increase the odds of death among everyone infected by the disease."
2021-02-08 16:12:03,"The story about the patient who felt his mask was ""too confining"" is sad. The virus is unfortunately very unforgiving. If you fail to protect yourself by social distancing and wearing a mask you might pay the ultimate price. It's a very sad he lost his life. A mask is confining. But COVID hypoxia is also very confining. A ventilator is also very confining. I guess it's all about choices. Choose not to wear a mask and suffer the consequences."

Newsome was transferring patients early in the epidemic across the state via helicopter.   
 It was clear NYC's high fatality rate was due to the public hospitals being too crowded, when private hospitals in Manhattan had plenty of beds. Why the failing during the holidays when everyone knew this was coming?  This is also not new news - there was a lot of reporting in December in CA newspapers about MLK hospital and it was clear they had too many patients and too few resources.  Why was nothing done?"
2021-02-08 16:30:04,"Thank you for this article. While I live in Canada, I am a US citizen.  This article brought tears to my eyes as I put myself in the shows of the two men who passed away, and their families."
2021-02-08 16:30:21,"This article alludes to insurance coverage but not sufficiently recognizing that In America it’s the private health insurance industry that controls health care delivery. A system where health care is a product in a consumer marketplace. Where those with the financial means can buy into premium insurance plans with the fewest restrictions, that provide the widest access to medical professionals and ancillary services. This Los Angeles hospital described here in an area serving a population significantly of low income, the impoverished,  are likely those predominantly recipients of government health insurance, in California called Medicaid. The quality of care, the limited resources of this institution, serves to reveal one primary operational component of health care in this country. In America, those who have the money to pay for it, get the best quality health care."
2021-02-08 16:42:46,"Many large hospitals have purchased smaller ones and shut them down. The number of hospital beds have been decreasing for 8 years now. All while our Justice department looks the other way. Lately, health insurance companies have been buying up clinics and then increasing co-pays at competitor clinics and forcing them to either merge or go out of business. Health insurance company stocks have gone up by 200% in the last 7  years. Again, there is no regulatory body at the state level or federal level that is monitoring this. Our Covid-19 death rate is double that of many developing countries. No doubt obesity and higher percentage of the population above 60 years of age is to blame to some extent. But our health industry needs a bipartisan effort to improve outcomes. A first step would be to mandate publishing of death rates for Covid-19."
2021-02-08 16:15:56,"IMO, the most troubling part of this report is that the MLK Director has desperately reached out to Governor Newsome and even attempted to publicly “shame” other hospital Directors into helping them, unsuccessfully mind you.

First, these patients got what is the standard of care in the US, steroids, blood thinners and mechanical ventilation when needed. The discussion of plasma or ECMO as things that should have been offered is misleading. The EUA for plasma was extraordinarily weak and the evidence for convalescent plasma is poor and it really is not considered a standard of care for COVID patients anymore. The use of ECMO is complicated and there is a reason that it is limited in it's scope and application. It is also a limited resource and has strict criteria for utilization. 

The part of this that troubles me most is actually the lack of dialysis machines. Dialysis is a straightforward and life saving technology and the lack of machines should put a firm limit onto the number of ICU COVID patients a hospital can have. 

Ultimately, there are so many societal failures that lead us to this point. In addition to the heartbreak of these families, I feel for the staff at that hospital who have to see death day in and day out, in a pandemic people are not taking seriously and feeling like they do not have the tools to do so effectively. So demoralizing."

Meanwhile, Covid deniers and anti-vaxxers temporarily blocked a vaccination center at Dodgers stadium. Some held signs saying 99.96% of those stricken survived, not fazed by being 5,000% wrong. They also claimed the current vaccines are unsafe despite many tens of thousands successfully vaccinated in preliminary trials and millions in subsequent rollouts. No doubt some also believe Trump won in a landslide, Democratic leaders are pedophiles and cannibals, and Jewish space lasers started California wildfires.

In fact, the Good Samaritan was actually the last person who should have stopped to help the man beaten by robbers and left to die on the side of the road. The beaten man was ignored by two others of his same faith, but the Samaritan, whose people had nothing to do with the Jews and the Jews had nothing to do with them, is the one who stops to help.

The vast majority of healthcare innovations, devices, new drugs, and new therapies come from American pharmaceutical and medical companies. As someone who trained at Bellevue on New York, I spent many hours taking excellent care of patients who had no other options. The notion that people are always getting shortchanged at public hospitals is mostly incorrect. We need more research to figure out why this disease hits certainly communities harder, but this is a complex issue, and is not app about “haves and have nots,” racism, classicism, and all the other isms that the editorial staff here are obsessed with."

The tragedy this article describes is the result of stretching our safety net so thin that our hospitals and other support services cannot help citizens of Latin America who have chosen to come here for economic reasons. If we want to have better health care systems to prevent unequal hospitals, there is no magic money tree.  But we may have to look at cutting back on some of the ways we have changed in the past few decades to make our country more sustainable, and that might mean we stop exploiting illegal immigrants and creating unequal economies in our country."
2021-02-08 17:11:57,I'm not trying to victim blame but...it sounds like this was preventable. It doesn't sound to me like this was the hospital's fault or should be held up of some kind of symbol of inequity. One of these victims made a choice to attend church gatherings and remove his mask. I don't understand why so many people believe that they are invincible. I'm sad for the families but flagrant disregard of common sense rules often leads to bad outcomes.
2021-02-08 17:01:16,"It appears that an unfounded distrust of doctors and the healthcare system contributes greatly to any disparities in outcomes.  If you put off coming to a hospital until you are desperately ill, then of course your chances of survival will be less."

2021-02-08 16:49:57,"""many patients had a “distrust of the health care system, distrust of doctors""""

Well of course they did! The system has shown itself time after time to be predatory. How could anyone trust a system that routinely hits people with surprise out of network bills priced 400% (or more) higher than what an insurance company would pay for the same treatment?"
2021-02-08 17:19:55,"I think what many families need to realize is that if your parents have managed to raise multiple children, and many or all of those kids have gone to college and have decent jobs as a result, adult children need to realize that its time to help mom and dad out financially. 

If adult kids can afford to pay for their parents' insurance and not rely on this false hope provided by this illusion of a ""safety net"", that is one effective way to work around the horrible Medi-Cal system. 

This is a very tough transition in all families; to go from being the child who was given care to the caregiver of parents in their 50s, 60s and older. But in our current healthcare system, adult kids paying for their parents' medical insurance is the quickest way to solve this crisis as we wait for a superior, fairer system to be invented in the U.S."

This is a viral pandemic. There are no antibiotics. Either you beat the virus or the virus beats you. It’s that simple. 

A year into it, with all the best minds globally working on the problem, it still remains - live or die, can your immune system beat the virus before it beats you?  Many people continue to die all around the world from this virus. Yes, even in the ever so popular socialized medicine countries. Yes, even in hospitals with access to anything and everything. 

Face it - there is no silver bullet in the hospital. No cavalry can save the day. Nor can Calvary. Your best hope is not to get infected in the first place. That means staying out of poorly ventilated buildings with lots of other people and no masks.

Beyond that, pick your grandparents well and be young, strong and thin. 

The rest is just jawboning. There is no saying that this therapy or that device would have saved the men in this story. Plenty of folks are dying even with every device and technique currently known. 

Stay home, stay out of crowds and stay out of public buildings. Keep your mask on, no matter what, where or with whom. And stay alive and healthy until the vaccine is available to you."

At SF General, the city is giving shots only to those who can prove they live in certain heavily Hispanic zip codes.

However, personal responsibility is also required.  Going to church service and gatherings with large numbers of people in a small enclosed space?  Especially if you have diabetes and heart/high blood pressure issues?  The blood of Jesus will protect you?  I suggest the culprit for the unequal death toll does not rest solely on MLK hospital.

The focus of this article is misplaced, along with what could have been a powerful example to alter how to cope in a pandemic.   Instead of portraying the deceased as victims, the headline and lead paragraph should have highlighted how these deceased men and women’s voluntary choices of gathering indoors, without the protection of masks, and social distancing ended their lives.

I have great sympathy and heartfelt sorrow for the families affected.  But, that doesn’t mean the protections and cautionary steps taken at the beginning of the pandemic can be any less as we near the final months, either."

As a patch, we could promptly implement a system that determines the need for PROMPT placement in particular institutions-for sick patients. That should override the refusal to accept because of financial risk to the institution, as long as the beds, staff and necessary resources were available.

It is plausible that for those patients who lack adequate insurance coverage, a federal emergency program would provide complementary coverage (at “reasonable” rates).

Just until we manage to develop a national system for essential disease care (10-100 years from now?).

2021-02-08 17:28:04,"I am a nurse and for most of my career I have been an Intensive Care Nurse. I was very proud to be able to make a difference in caring for patients, especially critically ill ones. As time went by I was increasingly disillusioned because of the disparity in the level of care available to everyone. Even Mayo Clinic, where I worked for 8 years, had a VIP wing and made it available to people that thought they were important as well as people from all over the world. It did come with it's own set of charges that were much higher than everyday patient stays. This type of unit and ""special"" care is not unique to Mayo. As a nurse I did not care what walk of life you came from, your race, your standing in the community or your ability to pay. Everyone does not get equal treatment in this country. Also, the level of Critical Care provided varies widely. Not all Intensive Care Units are created equal and not all staff have the same level of competence and I have worked in hospitals all over the country in the last 30 years. I tell people all the time, avoid hospitalization if at all possible. Know as much about your condition as you can. Take someone with you and ask questions. Do not be afraid to say no or to ask for another opinion. Most important, speak up or have your rep speak up. I know Covid has overwhelmed many hospitals but once we are past this, keep these rules in mind because treatments vary widely depending on which hospital you arrive at. Even some considered ""Great""."

2021-02-08 18:12:54,"There is so much wrong with this article that I do not know where to begin. It is frankly offensive. 

First of all—treatments have indications. Ecmo spots are very limited and it has very specific indications limited to specific cases. It is not just another “escalation of care” to thoughtlessly advance. 

Furthermore, the evidence behind many covid-19 treatments is mixed. The data shows that certain criteria should be met before using certain treatments. Do not forget that treatments can harm.

Additionally, you cannot just “transfer to a better hospital”. If that was the case the entire country would be admitted to MGH. A transfer has to have a medical reason and “my dad wants a MD from Stanford” is not a good reason. We have medical licensure and board certification in place to ensure all doctors have the baseline ability to meet standard of care—these tests are not easy. 

The individuals who work at these safety net hospitals are often of the community they serve and work very, very hard. The patients they serve are often extremely complex and have comorbidities associated with poverty. That does not even take into account the fact that these hospitals lack the same funding. One cannot simply expect the same outcomes. 

Lastly, the pandemic, the government’s anemic response, and the actions of Americans including the victim of the story broke the healthcare system. We were warned about this. We ignored it. Now we pay the price."

The survivors or the deceased’s next of kin get to enjoy crushing medical debt for what is done, another reason they avoid care in the first place. It is silly, to a certain extent, because society does end up paying for things anyway, either with increased medical costs passed on to those who can pay, or by virtue of increased welfare for those disabled by poor health that wasn’t handled properly in the first place.

Worse than all of this, and this was a fairly horrifying article, is how many people in the US don't bother going for any care because it's too expensive or they don't know how much it will cost but it will be more than they can afford.  How many illnesses worsen or develop because of our wealth care system's built in inequalities?  How many patients on even simple medication regimens skip those meds because of the cost?  And why oh why must it take a severe crisis like COVID19 for our politicians/legislators to even discuss how to improve our wealth care system?  

For a self proclaimed rich country the United States doesn't act like one.  It acts like every little thing that other countries do to ensure their citizens health and well being is asking too much.  And the ""socialism"" that these countries engage in hasn't damaged their economies the way our stingy systems do.  We lose people in the prime of life.  We lose people who should not die.

2021-02-08 18:51:17,The poor get Medi-Cal in California.  Those who are not here legally get emergency treatment only which means stabilize only.  The problem with Medi-Cal in California is it keeps moving to an Managed Care type system instead of a Fee For Service (which means one can go to any doctor who take Medi-Cal).  I refer to Managed Care as really meaning Managed Costs.  The fees paid to the physicians are so low they have to see too many patients to survive financially and the level of care drops.  All referrals to specialists  take time and create delay issues.  The only real solution is to take insurance companies who are in it for the middleman profit out of the equation and having a government sponsored plan for all.  If you want supplemental then you can pay for that.  But the insurance companies will fight and pay off the right wing to make sure their money keeps flowing while the poor and average person get less.

2021-02-08 18:49:29,"The situation could soon get worse.  Out of fear that the large numbers of people who were requesting asylum might bring more of the Covid infection into the country, Trump stopped accepting asylum requests at the border.  Many of those who had been hoping to be allowed into the U.S. then decided to either return to their own countries or to request asylum in Mexico, but over 20,000 people decided to wait at the border. 

Based on Biden’s statements that he would offer a more humane approach to asylum seekers and to undocumented immigrants, some of the people who have been waiting at the border are now crossing into the U.S.  The Biden Administration has decided not to turn them back. The first groups of migrants were channeled to charities who could provide them with food, clothing, and shelter.  Word that the migrants had been accepted into the country evidently spread because many more migrants are now coming.  The shelters are now too full to accept any more so the Immigration Service is just dropping new ones off at bus stops.  All of the migrants, including those in shelters, are free to go where-ever they want in the country, as long as they show up for their asylum  hearings.

I could have stayed for two weeks if I wanted to and it would have been covered. The facility was pristine and I even had a veranda where I could take in views of the Alps. Since moving back to America, I've often thought about why we can't make the medical system more functional, more equitable. The reality is, too many people at the top of the food chain are profiting from the system. Until medicine is viewed as a human right, rather than a profit-machine, things will never improve."
2021-02-08 19:21:11,"I am not sure this piece is really of help. It paints this safety net hospital as a villain and has the potential to erode the trust of the local community even further. Many of the treatments including plasma have conflicting data and have fairly narrow criteria for their use.
I am afraid that this article perhaps unintentionally takes the complex problem of health disparities and tries to explain it as a problem of second hand treatment in the hands of a safety net hospital. All hospitals stretched thin and beyond their capacity in the middle of this pandemic will have less than optimum outcomes.
We as as a society need to take a closer look at how we enable people to lead unhealthy lifestyles that bring on chronic health problems like diabetes and obesity which obviously affect the socio-economically disadvantaged disproportionately.

2021-02-08 19:46:10,"I spent six months talking to patients who were positive for COVID--just like these.  Not only did they have jobs that required them to show up in person (rather than telecommute), they also did not have paid sick leave.  Calling out sick for two weeks was not an option.

Once they were positive for COVID, isolating from other family members was impossible due to the ongoing housing crisis here in Los Angeles.  Low-wage workers are forced to live in subpar housing, with multiple family members crammed into small living spaces.  The need to stay away from others for 10 days, and to use a separate bathroom was not feasible for many.  The crowded living conditions of our low-wage workers, and lack of affordable housing is one of the primary contributors to the high case numbers here."
2021-02-08 20:05:16,The patterns of communications and densities of population bring the places where most people interact interpersonally are concentrated about the old centers of life in Los Angeles. The greater Los Angeles area is vast with the inhabited areas stretching unbroken for thousands of square miles. Most of the region is dispersed and relies upon automobile transportation. But the oldest communities with the highest densities and the greatest public transportation in use and people mingling are also more likely to be where most who serve others directly for work also live. This makes the people who live in these communities more vulnerable.
2021-02-08 20:11:22,"All of the views in this post are my own. I'm one of the physicians in this specialty at one of the other hospitals in LA mentioned here. I've also trained at large County hospitals in other parts of the US that treat exactly the same patient population as MLK. And I can absolutely say that there is a separate and unequal healthcare system in this country. It's a shame that this is the case in the world's most advanced country, but even within large metro areas around the US, the level of resources available at hospitals varies significantly and impacts the level of care we physicians can provide to patients. It's frustrating knowing that there are therapies available that you are unable to use for your patient - a fellow human being - who may be suffering from ailments that could be better treated if only they lived in a different part of town or had different insurance or a different set of circumstances in life.

The comments vary widely; some blame the undocumented, some blame the system, some blame people's habits or lack of belief in science. I can tell you it's all very complicated and never perfect. But the one thing that HAS to change is that providing healthcare CANNOT be a business. The corporate takeover of hospitals, the ever-increasing push to create profit (yes, even within nonprofit organizations), and the persistently rising cost of insurance for the same benefits has to stop. All we want is to be able to care for our patients; please stop making it so hard."
2021-02-08 20:16:18,"We've had a year to strategize resources.  The saddest part is those who die due to lack of available treatment that actually was available, but just never made it to the patient and sat unused waiting for the right patient to come along."
2021-02-08 12:51:24,"This is an absolutely essential read. I applaud Dr. Fink’s reporting. As an intensive care doctor myself, I have witnessed this type of inequity first hand. The reality is that big, academic institutions don’t want to take transfers of COVID-19 patients because it means they can’t continue to do profitable elective surgeries. The mortality rates at community hospitals are much higher because they don’t have enough staffing, whereas at bigger hospitals with far more doctors, icu nurses, and staff, patients have better outcomes. Hopefully reporting like this will change the system so we can have more coordinated, equitable care. I am deeply saddened that in a country like ours, we can’t treat everyone equally during the worst medical crisis of our lifetime."
2021-02-08 20:22:23,"All practicing medical professionals and providers (hospitals, clinics, the doc-in-a-box down the street, the local pharmacy) in the US should be required to accept Medicare, Medicaid, and any private-provider offerings of such as a requirement for licensing.  Period.  And all of these should include coverage, standard, for the ""other"" bits of human bodies, like eyes, ears, teeth...

Add reasonable charges and co-pays (non-necessary, cosmetic, whatever) and malpractice limitations as wishlist items.

2021-02-08 19:22:29,"Perhaps they need to have a campaign in Spanish language to really emphasize to the immigrants how important precautions are, like avoiding large gatherings (the one fellow caught it at church taking off his mask) and wearing a mask. As a COVID floor worker, I am just done with all the maskless people who choose to do their own thing. I no longer bother to give friendly reminders that the mask doesn't work when a nose is uncovered, after getting nasty replies back. I just decided to keep myself safe, wear the mask and avoid crowds , restaurants, church, bars etc. If others want to take risks, that is THEIR PROBLEM when they catch it. I'm just done. I have sympathy for those who catch it through no fault of their own, but those who knowingly take a risk and get sick, not so much. I cannot even count how many patients who have caught it doing  risky stuff, ie Bible study, jetskiing with an infected person, playing cards with buddies unmasked and not sanitizing  hands in the cards, going out to bars etc. I despise these people for making more work for healthcare workers by doing  dumb stuff to catch COVID. But this article missed one thing. How many people who are in this hospital have no papers and delayed care for fear of deportation or the bills? Delayed care results in worse outcomes. Get more information out to these groups in their language to help them understand. Heck, they might even be better off going back to their home country for care!"

2021-02-08 19:52:27,"Some points jumped out at me regarding this article:
- both men had underlying conditions; diabetes, High blood pressure, obesity.
-both lived in dense housing areas.
-one man had continued to attend church services, did not wear his mask.
- one man was undocumented, did not speak English, neither he nor wife when ill were told to isolate or quarantine.
- both men continued working even when feeling ill.
- both had distrust of hospitals and doctors and one refused intubation.  The other did not turn up treatment until the last minute.
A National Health service would not have prevented these men from dying in a pandemic.  The health guidelines which have been broadcast for many,  many months, were not followed; their lifestyles/customs  did not allow for this.  Their local hospital, overrun with similar cases did all they could for them.  
As one who has knowledge of the National Health hopitals in the UK and Europe you don't get to specify which hospital you go to, unless specialised treatment is required and only a specialised hospital can provide this.
When is the US going to realise that there is a whole swath of residents who are always going to fly below the radar when it comes to employment, health, accommodation and standard of living due to its proximity to South America? Unless it's prepared to pour more billions into this region and/or strengthen up our immigration laws, this will continue."
2021-02-08 20:00:06,"I find the comments that reject/limit sympathy for these two men, because they didn't wear masks to worship, attended church, didn't go to the hospital at the earliest signs of sickness, etc, all very miserly and shorn of compassion by glaring privilege. 

To access, understand and believe quality information networks takes a certain level of education. By extension, that means a certain level of privilege, because the notion that school is a level playing field, where only meritocracy operates, is Caucasian-coined garbage. (The figures steadfastly show that Latinos face multiple barriers in the education system and consequently many underperform 
there.) The government has shifted position on masks multiple times. A subculture has formed around masks as political more than medical. It takes literacy, time and context to sift the science from the popular lore, and literacy, time and context requires certain advantages. 

Same goes for quality support networks. Church was probably the most meaningful support networks these men had, outside their families. Mexico and Latin America in general is deeply Catholic, with that faith enabling millions of people to persevere in economic and social conditions the likes of which few Americans will ever know. (Poverty, violence, sexual violence.) Yes, Mr. Virgen took his mask off to better articulate his faith. 

Before you finger wag at him from your NYT perch of privilege, consider how much more he has needed God in his life than you."

County, by the governor, and by President Biden, who should at the very least be pressuring the governor to aid MLK, Jr. Community Hospital.

2021-02-08 19:58:05,"A tragedy that so many doctors and nurses of all backgrounds routinely deliver different care to different communities in Los Angeles. It is bizarre when so many of the care givers with family in the underserved communities do not give them the same care as the privileged. Is that the story? No, of course not. We do not assure that wealth determines whether people are able to live healthy lives with good food, adequate exercise, and the ability to relieve distresses which result in illnesses. The better paid people with better health care are able to isolate themselves while those with lower wages and poorer health are forced to expose themselves to the most people, and are thus more vulnerable to becoming infected. The suffer from poorer health that comes from the more stressors of all kinds.

This pandemic makes it clear how interrelated are the lives of all and yet some manage to live with more control over their own well being due to inequities. Those inequities result in people overwhelming the medical care system which all need when it's needed most. The secret to managing a pandemic is slowing the spread and minimizing the harm to those infected. 

Our inequities just make minimizing the harm skewed to the favor of the more affluent, not to the people who live more virtuously. It's justified by too many who claim that ill fortune and misery are deserved because of sloth and immorality so those who suffer from lack of resources have only themselves to blame."
2021-02-08 20:32:16,"California has high taxes on its high earners.  It has chosen to spend much of this money on the general welfare of poor families (many of whom are undocumented) and on their children’s schools.  

When the cost of housing and various federal and state welfare programs are taken into account, a fifth of Californians are poor and many more are nearly poor. 

One of the immigrants in this article, Mr. Virgen, has only a primary school education.  This is not unusual for immigrants from rural Mexico where, until just a few years ago, many towns only had primary schools.  

Many Central Americans are coming here with less education than Mr. Virgen.

It is widely accepted that it takes more educational resources to educate the children of less educated parents. Children of parents with a high school diploma require more resources than those with college-educate parents. The children of parents with no more than a primary school education require an inordinate amount of resources.

California has chosen to invest much of its tax money on the welfare and education of its poor immigrant families, but there are so many of them that even with contributions from the federal government and philanthropies, there is never enough money.

Even with substantial federal contributions, there is not enough money left to equip this hospital for a pandemic.

Now that Biden is president, many more undereducated people have decided to move here so schools and hospitals will become more crowded."

If this tale of two treatments doesn't convince us that we need one medical system, one payment system for all, then what will?

This crisis exposed four critical areas that needed help yesterday. Then the blame on whether personal responsibility and/or social responsibility could have changed the outcome to be decided after a larger analysis based in more data. At every point along the process of their medical issue for these two individuals would a different choice made a critical difference? Too many factors in only two cases make this nearly impossible to determine. Heartbreaking, true, but bigger analytical studies need to push us as a society to make better outcomes.

Those sell for about $1,000 to $2,000. You're telling me a group of 6 cardiologists can't afford new exam tables? It's the profit motive. They didn't care about cleanliness or in-tact equipment - they were just in medicine for the money. 

Tried to get mental health care under Medi-Cal in L.A. County. Went through a lengthy interview process at a country office. Never got a follow up call to set me up to see a counselor. Made me wonder if maybe that county office was just collecting my data to sell. Called to follow up. Left messages. Never got a return call.

Having gone through this ""health care"" system for the poor in these two counties, it is no mystery to me why homeless people are dying in the streets by the thousands in Southern CA. All the homeless are eligible for Medi-Cal. SO WHAT?

I also know of 2  households (now US citizens) who would  like to sponsor their parents to come to the US.
In all cases there is one aspect which means they will not do so; the cost of health insurance - never mind the deductibles and the co-pays.  None would dream of living in the US without health insurance.
This huge cost to everyone in the US is never mentioned when extolling the virtues of allowing refugees and asylum seekers into the country - and yet it is the main reason why people have poor health treatment, and fall into debt.  It also is never a factor to the migrants themselves. together with poor housing and level entry jobs.  Maybe for them, because someone else pays for it?"

It is because a lot of hospitals have closed over the last 4 decades because the reimbursement rate for them from Medicare, Medicaid, Veterans, etc., didn't make them financially viable.  However, this is only because we haven't had a single Payer healthcare system, where all pay, no matter the income, or government transfers each month, base on all income, on a sliding fee scale.  With 332 million, or more people in this country, 60% of them unhealthy, our costs can' be born by the taxpayer alone, as Congress has allowed so many deductions, and credits in the over 70,000 pages of the IRS Tax Code that fewer, and fewer at all levels of income are paying any federal taxes.  Our country only takes in 60% of the revenue we spend each year, on top of our now approaching over $30 trillion in debt in the next by the end of March.

We need  regional systems to coordinate emergency care and critical admissions across hospital systems. Maryland (albeit with smaller population overall) has a system that was described in the Washington Post recently. <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/maryland-hospital-capacity/2020/12/06/2d8fb84c-29e6-11eb-9b14-ad872157ebc9_story.html"" target=""_blank"">https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/maryland-hospital-capacity/2020/12/06/2d8fb84c-29e6-11eb-9b14-ad872157ebc9_story.html</a>

I come from the L.A. area, lived there when King/Drew had reasonably high quality care. After moving away, I read about the decline in quality, it closure, and its re-opening with limited services. Again, I'm astounded MLK tried to manage so many covid patients, and sad that LA doesn't have a system to not only coordinate admissions/transfers, but also that can tell a well-resourced hospital that it must take patients according to relative resources, and not refuse patients 'based on insurance.'  

Another disgrace - emergency personnel refusing to take a patient clearly in distress because the 02 isn't below a stated threshold. Such refusals (also by triage phone lines) have been clear barriers to access for almost a year.

We also need repeated rapid antigen tests widely available at workplaces and transit agencies, with guidance for workers.

As you should know with your medical degree, the monoclonal antibody is only really beneficial if within 10 days of symptoms. By the time the patient presented after New Year, he had been sick since before Christmas, ie over 10 days. Rather than insinuating he didn’t get infusion because he’s being discriminated against, please have more integrity when writing medical “facts”. Or you could even put your stethoscope back on and actually do some doctoring if you feel people need better medical care. I have no affiliation with MLK but trying to help an underserved population sounds better than other hospitals who cherry pick their celeb patients.

But one needs to consider that not even the biggest have limitless resources and all cost much money to operate.

Hopefully they didn't need to take an ambulance when they were sick because that is  a whole other bill that can  generate a stroke. 

However according to congress and some experts Americans are living large if they make over $50,000 and can afford to pay their bills and the bills of those highlighted in this article. Obviously the NYTs feels the same way based on its obsession with helping illegal immigrants.

How about, instead of complaining why people die in this hospital and/or not that one we focus on what is truly important in the long term. And that is diet. Why are so many Hispanics obese and suffering with diabetes?  Their diet is often horrendous. (I lived in Mexico several years- I can attest to this) Full of highly inflated carbohydrates, processed foods, inflammatory oils, chips, soda (the children walk to school each morning eating large bags of chips and 1/2 quart bottles of coke.) The diet of African Americans is not much better. (and I concede many whites as well) If we had spoken honestly over the past 13 months (instead of being terrified of 'fat shaming' accusations or other such nonsense) we could have saved many hundreds if not thousands of lives. When/if this pandemic is over or not- we need a Marshall plan for diet.  Do BLM members really want to save lives? I imagine most do. Then I suggest they get out of the streets (where they might save one life a year with protests) and go door to door with brown rice, quinoa, broccoli, fresh salads (olive oil dressing, only) free range chicken/beef.  Armed with knowledge, familiar with the works of Gary Taubes and others,  they will save tens of thousands of lives a year- black, white, and Latino."

That trauma center that closed in 2004 cost 9 figures and was open for patients in my last year of residency. Not mentioned is the reason it closed- the surgery residency was the worst in the country. The internal medicine residency was equally pathetic. Patients were dying. The hospital, rife with affirmative action, needed to be shut down. 
They reopened, but never had the resources. Even with that 9 figure trauma center the place was critically understaffed. Why would that change? Don't even get me started on the LA County Board of Supervisors, who came around for photo ops but whose neglect of the place was criminal. Killer King. Patients died. 
Some questions never get answered though. Why do so many of the victims in the article have diabetes and high blood pressure? Hmmm. Why do so many fail to speak English after being here for so many years, arriving when they were fairly young? First immigrant group in history that couldn't bother learning English. Was the article about essential workers from a poor part of Los Angeles? Sounds like one of the patients died because he believed in Jesus a bit too much for his own good. Also sounds like his pastor had a hand in killing him too.

It’s a blessing to patients and co-workers to have an R.N. trained in mental health. With her added qualification she usually would have been warmly welcomed. She and I had built successful groups for dual diagnosis patients; those with substance abuse/dependence concerns as well as in need for mental services for chronic and often acute conditions. Many of  our clients were gang affiliated from multigenerational families. We were accepted by them and our services were valued. She was not easily spooked.

He came to the United States because he could access elite medical care. There are always trade offs. Everyone here may believe socialized medical care would somehow mean that everyone can access elite systems like this lung machine. But thats not how it works. In Canada the reason the system works is that they only have so many extremely expensive systems. If you cant afford it you will sit on a wait list for pretty much everything under a socialized healthcare system.  This ends up creating the same two classes of citizens that exist in our system. One that gets what it can get, and the other with elite insurance that can access elite care. If everyone could get on a lung machine anytime the system would not be sustainable.

2021-02-09 02:49:15,"Many people here forecasting that a single payer/universal health cover/national health service will rid us of medical treatment inequities.
Don't be too sure.
The British Health Service used to be the epitomy of a good health system; and it was, when its revenue was in proportion to the people using it - the service relies heavily on payroll taxes in addition to general government taxation.
As the country has seen a vast increase in immigration over the past 20 years, together with a higher proportion of non working residents (seniors/children/disabled) the system is breaking under the strain - and it is seen  most in those areas where immigrants have congregated in large communities.  The hospitals, clinics and services in these areas have decreased where the revenues have decreased - not enough people paying into the system to keep it going.
Even if the US were to move to a single payer/universal health system I doubt whether it would have enough resources to keep it afloat without huge Federal input,  based on the number of low income/paycheck to paycheck citizens it has; not to mention the people who won't pay for health insurance 'because they never get ill'"
2021-02-09 02:59:00,"There could be more demands made on hospital services in the near future for the following reasons:

1.  Biden wants to offer legal status to every undocumented person who is here and to help them immediately bring in any children and spouses who still live in their home countries.  From antidotal stories, I gather that a large number of them have one or two children living with their parents or former partners back there.  This includes many who have found partners here and had children with them.  Others have a spouse and multiple children who would get to move here.  Within a year or so of legalization, the number of immigrants who will need health care, schooling, housing, transport, and so on may multiply by several times.

2.  Under its new leadership, the Immigration Service is saying that it would like to deport only those undocumented immigrants who have an “institutional record of violent behavior, well-documented gang affiliations, or aggravated felony convictions”.   (See the article “New Biden rules for ICE point to fewer arrests and deportations, and a more restrained agency in yesterday’s Washington Post.)

3.  People who have wanted to move here will decide that now is their chance.  Once across our borders, they would not be deported, and so they would able to bide their time until the next amnesty.

So many people could decide to move here illegally that they would place an impossible strain on our hospitals and other institutions."

 In Australia we have a national health scheme plus a private insurance sector for luxuries like guaranteed private rooms , private hospitals and being able to choose ones own Doctor etc. I have private cover most of my extended family do not bother. All emergencies go to major hospitals anyway  which have the best ,expensive, specialized equipment to deal with this .

 I know Biden has the right values but half of the nation would see any attempt to address this as communist  or socialism which they see as being the same."
2021-02-09 04:19:20,"Everybody knows America's health care system is obscenely expensive and unfair.  We need a third political party to fix it.  Republicans are good at standing up for the unborn, but the born, forget it.  Democrats, too, are in the pocket of big money interests.  Maybe if progressives keep hammering on Biden, things might change.  But the reality is, that's unlikely.  America is not as exceptional as it thinks it is."
2021-02-09 04:44:17,"As Timothy Snyder writes in his latest book, ""Our Malady,"" what we have in this country is not a health care system that incidentally makes a profit, but rather a profit-making system that incidentally delivers health care."

There are few opportunities in my field in Canada, as itis so much less populous, and my work pays much better here, so the US has provided amazing opportunities. But if I ever get seriously ill, you can believe I will hightail it back to Canada. The medical system in the US is insane. When you can get care, you are likely as not to go bankrupt from ""balance billing"" and greedy providers. Nuts."
2021-02-08 15:43:52,"Sorry, no tears. Both these COVID-19 victims entered this country illegally and were taking up hospital beds that should've gone to law-abiding Americans who fell ill, putting their lives in jeopardy.

2021-02-02 14:39:22,"People should make their own decisions based on current information, which changes almost daily. Don't pressure people to get shots. Don't interfere with someone else who wants to get a shot. Improve availability and distribution."
2021-02-02 14:42:07,"My question concerns those who have autoimmune diseases, who are very likely to get an immune system over-response to the vaccine.  Apparently no one with autoimmune disease was ever included in the trials.

So can the over-response bring on a relapsing of the autoimmune disease?  If someone gets the first dose, and has an over-response (that looks like their autoimmune disease) should they get the second dose?  And what is the best course of action if the vaccine actually promotes a surge of the autoimmune disease?"
2021-02-02 14:42:53,I know of 2 cases of people that still had antibodies from covid that had very bad reactions after the first shot more than 90 days after their initial symptoms..  Has anyone suggested former covid individuals take an antibody test before receiving their first injection?
2021-02-02 14:51:20,As usual non-scientific evidence was dominant in decisions of vaccination. Knowing that antibodies of COVID patients were used to treat sick people THEY decided to prioritize COVID recovered patients to receive the vaccine without checking the status of antibodies.
2021-02-02 14:54:42,I had to be hospitalized at the end of Dec 2020. I was very sick and was in the hospital for a week. Still recovering with pneumonia. With all these different people having only idea's of needing or not needing the vaccinations I will not be doing the vaccinations at this time until I can get more information. Covid is real. But I do not want to suffer again.
2021-02-02 15:44:39,Could getting a vaccine after recovering from COVID prompt a resurgence of autoantibodies in people who made a lot of them in response to the illness? Has this been studied at all?
2021-02-02 16:37:02,"I had 3 covid tests over 2020 and an antibodies test...all negative. And if by chance, I did have covid-19, I was asymptomatic. My only health issue is that I have Celiac disease. I had my first Pfizer jab and had intense symptoms 36 hrs later, chills and debilitating body aches. I took 2 aspirin and went to bed. Woke up 12 hours later feeling fine. I have no qualms about getting my 2nd jab."
2021-02-02 16:41:47,"This article seems a bit premature. The studies cited have inadequate sample sizes that cannot be extrapolated to the 26M+ Americans diagnosed with the coronavirus. While the anecdotal stories make for compelling copy, we do not know how representative they are, and we do not know what other underlying health conditions the subjects might have. While it would be great if coronavirus sufferers only require one dose of a vaccine, it seems too early to draw that conclusion from this sparse evidence."
2021-02-02 16:51:37,"Add me to the small numbers as I tested positive in July and had a mild case and recovered with negative follow up test. On receiving Pfizer first shot this week I had a two day flu like reaction.  I’m a little wary of the second shot. I know there were previously recovered patients in the trials, so I’ll go through the full series, but if I don’t need it someone else should use my place. As there are millions of us, that would free up slots. Please expand the series so accurate information is available."
2021-02-02 17:08:57,"Just got my second Moderna dose (I work in healthcare). I had a severe reaction to the first shot, with all the typical Covid symptoms.

2021-02-02 17:13:52,"I've been curious if there has been research on this, because it's exactly what happened to me. I got COVID in March, tested for a high antibody count, and as a teacher I eagerly got my first Moderna dose Jan 13. I woke up the next day and it was like I had COVID again - could barely stand up out of bed and nearly fainted. It cleared up quickly but I would LOVE to get some guidance on where my immunity stands now, and whether I actually need second dose. (It's next week, so I do plan to follow through with it). Feeling hopeful about the vaccine but if that dose could go to someone else, it would be nice to know."

Yes, it is true that physicians/true clinicians don't ""trash"" the dosage schedules approved by the FDA. Instead physicians change dosing schedules to accommodate variation in the patient's response and the clinical situation. To do otherwise and robotically follow the FDA approvals would, I'm afraid, lead to unnecessary morbidity for our patients. 

Some people call this the art of medicine. It could just as easily be labeled, common sense."
2021-02-02 19:01:40,"Both my husband, age 74, and I, age 71, were hospitalized with COVID-19, the first week in April 2020. Our symptoms were diarrhea, chills, fever, night sweats, overall extreme body pain, headaches, and my husband became incontinent, and was pretty incoherent. He also lost almost all strength below his waiste. Upon hospital admission, we were both diagnosed with double pneumonia, although we didn't have any noticeable respiratory symptoms. My husband was treated with Hydoxychloroquine. About 2 months after  discharge, we both tested positive on 2 separate antibody tests. January 6th, 2021, we both were very excited to have our 1st Moderna COVID-19 vaccinations. The morning after, I began feeling ill, and by about 4 PM, I was in bed with extreme overall body pain, nausea, headache, and I vomited. I could hardly get out of bed to use the bathroom. During  the second night, my husband's symptoms he had when he had COVID-19, returned with a vengeance. He was totally incoherent, when I found him lying on his bedroom floor, where he evidently had been for hours. We are grateful to have a PT coming to our home twice a week, the way we did when he was recovering from COVID, and he is recovering well enough now, that the nurse that was coming in once a week, no longer needs to come. Neither of us will get the 2nd Moderna vaccine, nor any other. Our doctors are thinking from surviving COVID-19, we still had strong antibodies in our systems, and with the 1st vaccine, we will be covered."
2021-02-02 19:15:37,"I am a pediatrician. I had Moderna vaccine exactly 90 days after contracting COVID. Few hours after getting the injection,  I had fever, malaise, nausea, diarrhea, anorexia, fatigue for 24 hrs, pain at injection site for 3 days. On day 8, I had similar symptoms for 24 hrs with an intense itching at the injection site with redness that lasted 3 days. On both occasions, I was in bed, too sleepy and too tired to move.  I am quite skeptical about getting the second dose but I am also scared to get a severe case of COVID.  I would like to see reports pertaining to delayed reaction or side effects following the first injection, especially in people with history of autoimmune disorders, asthma, allergies, mast cell disorders."
2021-02-02 19:19:17,"This makes a lot of sense and would undoubtedly help with the shortage of vaccine doses the entire country--and the world at large--is dealing with, as requiring only a single dose to people with proof of prior infection (an antibody test, ideally) would make a big difference logistically. Of course, the ideal would be to examine what is best for each person, so that the number of doses (for two-dose vaccines, anyway) would be contingent upon each individual's medical situation, but having some guidance on what to do for recovered folks would be excellent. (But this raises questions, too, about how single-dose vaccines, like J&J's, will work for recovered patients.)

Also, I just want to say that not enough media attention acknowledges the existence of people like me who have recovered from prior Covid infections. We are a very sizeable bloc--which isn't a good thing, given the scope of the pandemic, but it does mean that getting everyone immunized against Covid-19 might be a little easier, in the long run, than assuming that no one has any immunity and only can gain this through a standard two-dose vaccination round; in reality, we likely have some immunity already and needing a lower vaccine dose will be a good thing in the long run for everyone else. So, while we need more research, I take this is as cautiously good news."
2021-02-02 19:25:01,Is there any data on single dose vaccine reactions for previously infected individuals? That might be a better option once a vaccine is approved. The Johnson and Johnson vaccine provides lower immunity than the current vaccines but that might not be the case for those who already have already been infected. It would be acting like a booster shot. It might also mean fewer side effects for those previously infected.
2021-02-02 19:44:42,"Long haulers still suffering side effects from contracting Covid x months ago, will they get ADDITIONAL, NEW LONG TERM side effects from getting the vaccine, or will the original side effects get worse?
I lost a big part of my sense of taste from Covid last March, so will a vaccine (I don’t have allergic reactions) make my taste buds completely disappear or give me a new long term side effect?"
2021-02-02 20:11:28,"My brother, in hospice, miraculously survived COVID when it ripped through his nursing home in December. But he may not survive the 2d dose of the vaccine that he received yesterday. He is rUnning a fever and unresponsive today. His daughter was called to come immediately. Given the reports of intense reactions to the 2d dose being reported from others, it needs to be rapidly and seriously tracked whether a 2d dose poses imminent danger to those who have had COVID and who are otherwise medically vulnerable."
2021-02-02 20:13:30,"I am sorry, but this goes against all my understanding of how the immune system works. Why do the people who have had and survived this disease need any vaccine at all? Don't they already have antibodies to it? If not, how did they fight the disease off? And if the live virus did not prime their immune systems, how will an inactivated virus, or a portion of the RNA of the virus do it? And if they don't have antibodies, what is all discussion about convalescent plasma treatment all about?

Let me stress that I am not being callous about any ones health here. I just don't understand how this makes scientific sense."
2021-02-02 20:33:02,"What about people who have had covid with long term symptoms?  I had covid in March and then had severe fatigue, trouble breathing, rashes, muscle pain and other symptoms for 6 months. I still have a very elevated heart rate and dont feel back to normal. It has been so frustrating. Do we have any idea if covid long haulers should be vaccinated. I really really do not want covid again, but I also worry about a vaccine possibly impacting me negatively."
2021-02-02 20:44:55,"The article doesn't address those who tested positive, experienced relatively mild symptoms and then were given the monoclonal antibody infusion (MAI), i.e. my case.  I'm aware that I cannot get the vaccine for 90 days after the infusion but what is the degree of my immunity as a result of MAI?  I any shot necessary and how long does MAI immunity last.  If useful, Is one shot enough?  I realize that the scientists know very little about the disease but as long as they are providing a treatment, more follow-up needs to be done for every variation of treatment."
2021-02-02 14:29:50,"Why are shots being wasted on people who have already had Covid? This is what happens when the government puts itself in charge, sidestepping the market. The vaccines are designed to mimic the body's reaction to a Covid infection. These medical people can never figure out the simplest of things."
2021-02-02 14:49:17,"Everyone seems to have an opinion.  We need some facts, please."
2021-02-02 15:35:44,This answers part of my concern. Had COVID but am also a long hauler. Does the vaccine not only crank up the COVID again but also send you deeper into the long haul again? Are you into a worse long haul with an even further away chance of it ever ending?
2021-02-02 15:58:14,"Yes we are 70 and me 78 years old, and recovery from covid19 in mid Dec 2020, and we vaccinated on Jan-25-2021, with pfizer, and yes i have a similar reaction of the covid19 when i was sick but only for 2 days, my wife just have a pain in the arm and no that bad like me. Any way we have the appointment to use the second doses in Feb 22-21, the Orange County HD say is OK to way the 4 week instead the 3 week's, OMG so many different opinions. Any way we are happy to be sure dont get the covit again."
2021-02-02 14:59:55,Irrational to suggest previously infected patients should get the vaccine. Most will already have the same immunity that the vaccine gives. Plus it is a waste that prevents those with a need from getting vaccinated.
2021-02-02 16:18:19,"This study has *not been peer reviewed. 

NY Times et al. should wait until the work has been properly evaluated before publishing a story. They should at least indicate when work has not been peer reviewed."
2021-02-02 15:13:09,"Can you at least put the word ""experts"" in quotes?  It's been awhile since Epidemiology 101, but giving people a vaccine for a disease that they've already recovered from while possessing antibodies is completely unnecessary.  Can you ask the ""experts"" what the scientific basis of their recommendation is and please ask them to refrain from using the words; ""could"", ""maybe"", ""unsure"" and hopefully they have data that backs up this claim....thanks."
2021-02-02 17:39:39,"This is a weird one, but what if you had Covid and it was not documented because you had it really early, say in January which is when I think I had it. My take is that if you have an extreme reaction just don't get the second one. That is assuming there is any vaccine to get."
2021-02-02 22:28:05,"I wonder how many got covid but didn't know it, or didn't recognize whatever they had as the disease. Even so, it still seems that 1-2 days of flu-like symptoms in return for more than 60-70% longer-term immunity after the first dose is a price worth paying."
2021-02-02 22:33:54,"I was hospitalized for almost a month and on a ventilator for two weeks because of covid-19. I barely survived, and according to my medical records, I shouldn't have survived. At this stage, the vaccine scares me - I already have the strongest immunity possible from the virus, and there's absolutely no data on whether or not it'll kill me if I take it. At best the vaccine won't have an effect and at worst it'll trigger the same immune responses that shut down my lungs. However, it's increasingly looking like I'll need to take it at some point in order to be able to engage in society, which isn't a good option because nobody knows what will happen to someone like me."
2021-02-02 22:55:11,"I had Covid in early April. It was a fairly mild case. I lost my sense ot taste and smell, lost a lot of weight and could barely get out of bed for a few days and a lack of energy for quite awhile. I coukdn’t get tested then but tested positive for the antibodies in late June. I too am unsure about getting the vaccine. I’ve read that things will be better when people either have had the vaccine or are vaccinated. i that is the case I’ve wondered why people who have had the vaccine are treated the same as those who haven’t had it. I wish there was more definite info available now but I willl think long and hard whether to keep the appt at the end of the month for the first vaccine and especially the second one in March."
2021-02-02 23:16:18,"We must all realize that the vaccine protocols were arbitrary, although based on scientific knowledge.  Four weeks between shots?  Three weeks?  Same dose for second shots as first?  Etc.

So ironclad support for exactly following the protocol may be unnecessarily arbitrary.  Many medical interventions are modified from standard protocols depending on the individual patient, using what is called risk stratification.  The more risk, the more the protocol is varied, perhaps to a more intense treatment or perhaps to a lesser intensity.  Individualized treatment is the norm throughout medicine.

Yet with Covid we are unable to rationally decide what to modify.  There is no data.  We have anecdotal information, but, as they say, the plural of anecdote is not data.  A few years from now there will be enough data to answer the questions posed by other posters in these comments, but now all is guesswork.  

When faced with a pandemic that will not end until all of mankind is either a survivor or has had an effective vaccine,  we will have to go with guesses, educated guesses, protocols, or emotions.  The only certainty available is uncertainty."
2021-02-02 23:20:40,Why are physicians telling people who have recovered not to get antibody testing? That makes no sense.  Would it not be helpful in decision making re the vaccines?
2021-02-03 00:32:39,"OK.  What about this: one dose of Moderna, and then a second dose, but with Pfizer?  What would happen , i.e., would there be any potential negative effects?"
2021-02-02 23:46:39,"SO what is happeneing to Covid survivors after the 2nd shot so far?  I had similar symptoms after the 1st shot to what I experienced with Covid - but no fever.  I was out of commission for 1 1/2 days.  Will my symptoms be WORSE after shot #2, or is the worst likely over?"
2021-02-02 22:52:42,"Didn’t the medical community investigating COVID find it necessary to exclude or delay people from receiving the vaccination for a period of 5 months after the date of recovering from the virus?

That would leave 30 million vaccines available for 15 million people to be protected and less likely to contribute spreading the virus..."
2021-02-03 00:48:46,"People having such reactions almost certainly have serious vitamin D deficiency, without which the immune system remains dysregulated and behaves in this way. Giving vaccines without correcting nutritional status is a sin of omission of historic proportions which perfectly highlights the dark side of medicine led by profit rather than science, despite all the exhortations to the contrary."
2021-02-02 22:35:28,Those who have already had COVID should go to the back of the line.  This rollout prioritization is insanity... we’ll be left with a country of incapacitated but covid-less people in assisted living homes and people who refuse to wear masks.
2021-02-02 22:41:12,"What if you are pretty sure you had it but never got a test? Do you just see what response you have to the first dose, and if it's robust, assume that is enough? Or what?"
2021-02-02 15:24:22,I wonder if the J&J shot would be better for people who already had COVID.
2021-02-03 01:24:33,"I was a Pfizer trial volunteer.  I was sick back in January 2020 with a bad cough and very tired for a few days, but there was not any way to get tested then.  I wondered if I had Covid then? 

A week after the first Pfizer shot in August (which is when a T-cell reaction would be) I had symptoms for one night - chills, mild fever.  No reaction after second shot. So seems pretty reasonable that this applies to me..."
2021-02-03 02:30:31,"I was on a cruise ship (the Zaandam) in March 2020. My husband and I both had moderate cases of Covid while in isolated and on lockdown in our cabin on the ship.  Many people were very sick. (A side note-- the captain and crew were nothing short of heroic dealing with this extraordinary  situation)...
We both tested positive for antibodies approximately 5 weeks after infection. We were told that they likely last 90 days.
I am my 97 year old father's ""essential caretaker"" at his elders' facility. I am in my 70th year. The facility offered us the moderna vaccine in order to keep the residents safe. 
My personal doctors urged me to take the vaccine since the science is not settled about how long antibodies last, or the possibility of second infections for people like me. And most importantly, the elders must be protected. I grappled with taking the vaccine-- was it the right thing to do? 
I got the vaccine. 
I had a similar reaction to the doctor highlighted in this article. My reaction was very similar to how I felt on the Zaandam. Twenty-six hours after the vaccine, I spiked a fever, and my teeth began chattering uncontrollably unable to get warm for hours. I felt like I had been hit by a truck with body aches head to toe,  and a headache that is indescribable (medieval torture technique with head in a vise?).... 
It lasted 5 days."
2021-02-03 02:26:35,So many people here commenting that they already had Covid and have already received the vaccine... I wish there were more vaccines available for those of us who never had Covid!
2021-02-03 03:23:35,"This information poses a dilemma for people (like myself) who think they had Covid19 early last spring before testing was available.  Then when antibody tests first came out, they were widely reported to be inaccurate and maybe testing for the wrong signs of prior infection.  After antibody testing became more accurate and reliable, it was reported that most people’s antibodies had faded over the months to the point of not being detectable.  I feel like I’m trapped in a no-man’s land of unfortunate timing."
2021-02-03 03:27:41,"I got my first Moderna vaccine 12/28/2020 and then had a positive COVID test 9 days later. My symptoms were low grade temp a few times, dry cough, body ache, headache. I did not know if I should get my 2nd vaccine so I asked questions, looked online and found no answer. I am health care worker, age 60, over weight, no other risk factors. I was reporting to the CDC  V-safe on side effects and reported what occurred. Finally after a consult with PCP and pharmacist at work where vaccines were being administered, I got my 2nd vaccine Saturday the 30th. It was 5 days after my original return date because I wanted it to be a weekend. I did have head and body ache for about 48 hours but today I was fine. It would be interesting to know how my level of antibodies compare with having virus and vaccine that close together. I'm just going with I have ""super antibodies"" and volunteering to go to the Super Bowl. Probably won't happen but with my luck...maybe it will!"

I received my first Pfizer shot last Friday, and I felt horrible the next morning...chills, achy, fatigue...it was bad. I felt better the next day, but then I got a swollen and tender armpit for two more days, due to an inflamed lymph node.  Everyone should get the vaccine, but if you have had Covid, be warned that you might need to take the next day off to recover from your shot."
2021-02-18 14:56:52,"According to Dr. Rochelle Walensky head of the CDC, there is a plan and strategy to use State Health Departments, Commercial Laboratories and Academic Labs to scale up gene sequencing and analytics. Go to her interviews last weekend and especially the JAMA one. Things move so fast that I can see reporting can hardly keep up with the speed of changes. Which is why I am concerned that the speed of virus, variants and vaccinations are so important. Thanks for the reporting I would say for science at this time, it would have to be almost hourly reporting."
2021-02-18 16:15:28,"Quote for the ages:
“There’s clearly something going on with this mutation,” said Jeremy Kamil."
2021-02-18 16:44:47,"""It’s also hard to say whether the increase in variants is actually the result of their being more contagious. They might have become more common simply because of all of the travel over the holiday season. Or they might have exploded during superspreader events at bars or factories.""

Mutations become prevalent because they confer a selective advantage. The argument above is that, ""for some unknown reason"", those who initiated superspreader events, those who were infected and spread the virus at bars and factories, and those who traveled and spread the disease in airports and on planes, tended to have mutations in the amino acid at position 667 (not a ""677 mutation"", which appears to be the author's own non-scientific nomenclature). And, saying that the people who tended to spread the virus recently all had mutations altering the glutamine residue which normally resides at position 677 of the spike protein is no different than saying mutations at this amino acid appear to confer an advantage and be passed on. 

The alternative explanation would be that the DNA encoding the glutamine at position 677 is a ""hot spot"" for mutations, as different DNA sequences are copied with different accuracy and will pick up mutations at different frequencies. However, that these mutations encoding novel amino acids at position 677 of the spike protein are being maintained and are propagating again suggests that these mutations do offer a selective advantage to the virus."
2021-02-18 14:53:48,"The US has been the world epicenter of COVID-19, with ¼ of the world cases, despite having only 1/25 of the world population.  This was due entirely to Trump’s denial and incompetence.

So of course the US has a wider variety of contagious variants, more so than other countries (UK, South Africa, Brazil) with smaller pandemics.  If that wide variety has not yet been seen, it is because researchers in the US have not been looking, due again to Trump’s denialism.

Natural selection always favors more contagious variants.
Two cases of the same mutation from different lineages might be due to chance.  Maybe even 3.  But 7 different lineages from different locations indicates a clear evolutionary advantage.

In the long term, a universal COVID vaccine would help, as discussed in this article by the same author:

2021-02-12 19:19:40,"I have always been fascinated with pizza. For me, it's the perfect food for one simple reason... it's unique versatility.  Pizza can be adapted as a breakfast, lunch, dinner or dessert item. You can make it as healthy or as unhealthy as you desire. It can be consumed inside or outside, walking or sitting, driving on a deserted highway or sitting on a park bench. It knows no class distinctions, no age limits, no racial disparities or gender identification. It can be tailored to your liking, eaten at your leisure, and at the same time... convenient and inexpensive. No other food item comes close."
2021-02-12 19:26:28,"Weirdly, I haven't had even one piece of pizza since early 2020. It would appear a good thing for the pizza business that most people are not like me."
2021-02-12 19:30:59,"An oven hot pizza felt safer than getting cold, outside food. Even if fomites aren’t a huge source of viral transmission, we felt better removing a hot pizza from a box, reheating it again and served on our own plates. I felt leery about salads or smoothies that someone touched, coughed, or sneezed on. 
So, in our house what was once an occasional, high fat, junk food treat evolved into a safe pandemic meal. It was our first outside food after going through our stockpile my husband deemed The Trumpocalypse food."

2021-02-12 20:05:24,Pizza places certainly did well in the past year and that's no surprise - they were already focused on take-out/delivery vs dine-in.
2021-02-12 20:09:38,"The NYTimes cooking website (to which I am signed into) last year published a cheesy pan pizza recipe that is made using a cast iron skillet and a lot of olive oil.  I first made that recipe Memorial Day weekend, 2020 using a brand new cast iron skillet. And made it five times within a seven week period. I made it on numerous occasions since then. That cheesy pan pizza recipe made numerous end-of-the-year best recipes lists. Who needs a pizza parlor, when your own kitchen will do?"
2021-02-12 20:17:31,"Being retired and on a fixed income, chain delivery pizza is too expensive for my budget, and way larger than I need ... so I make my own at home, just for myself.  Safer,  faster, hot from my oven, and better tasting than any chain pizza I've ever had.  Occasionally get a rising crust frozen pizza, just for variety, and add on my own toppings.  I jokingly call my home made creations ""pandemic pizza"".  Whatever works, I say !"
2021-02-12 20:19:55,"I like pizza.

I also know it to be very expensive relative to its nutritional value."
2021-02-12 20:29:17,"This is interesting because prior to the pandemic the pizza industry was in decline as prices skyrocketed, families chose healthier options, and millennials were not interested.

We'll see if this surge stays once people can eat in restaurants again."
2021-02-12 20:34:44,I think it is also good value because it is also good left over....even cold!
2021-02-12 20:36:06,"An added benefit to pandemic pizza is the relatively low environmental impact of the packaging.  Yes, take out from fine dining restaurants now makes for some sublime options these days.  But too often, the fancier offerings employ loads of single-use plastic, and typically not of the somewhat recyclable varieties.  So thumbs up to delicious pizza arriving in a modest box or even the retro paper bag!"
2021-02-12 20:45:04,"Pizza is expensive. My relatives directed me to Jack’s Pizza which can be on sale sometimes at the fab price of five pies for $10.  Add your own toppings like mushrooms, onions, spinach. Not cheese as that makes it soggy. A couple of dinners for $2 plus whatever toppings? Yes please."
2021-02-12 20:52:24,"Pizza is actually quite expensive relative to ingredient cost; anything with a low of cost of ingredients will be, because proportionally a higher percentage of the cost has to go to labor. 

This makes it one of the worst foods to get delivered rather than make yourself, from an economic perspective. 

You can feed a family of 4 with home-made pizza for less than $5 (even if you buy the dough rather than making it); even the cheapest, worst-quality delivery will cost you three times that, probably four times that."
2021-02-12 21:30:10,"Lucky to live in Brooklyn wit a large variety of local pizza options, many of which are just excellent. It's become our Friday night treat throughout the pandemic to order a pizza. We're in our 40's and it kinda makes us feels like we're kids again... a pizza party for two to get us through!"
2021-02-12 21:46:41,"I am thankful to my pre-covid pizza joint which, due to sloppy virus sanitary protocol (one dude working the oven unmasked),  encouraged me to make my own pizza.

One fine recipe using King Arthur flour and cooked in a cast iron pan has outdone any pizza ordered out in my 64 years of living in New York City and elsewhere on this beautiful planet that may try to claim the title of the pizza capital of the world.

And, it is far cheaper and quite easy.

For all those I read about bemoaning the restrictions that they have ""suffered"" due to covid, a hobby as such might just be the rewarding endeavor that will pull you out of such doldrums.

Innovation does not come to you, you have to find it."
2021-02-12 21:56:08,2020 was the year we bought one of those wood pellet-fired pizza ovens.  For me homemade pizza is a joy - I’d have a hard time living without it.
2021-02-12 22:31:35,"To me, Pizza is like breathing air! I know, it’s not all that healthy .... but it is my comfort food and has been for over 60 years. When I take my grandkids out to dinner (before Covid-19) there was no question where we were going. Luckily, where I live there is fantastic pizza on literally every block. Even frozen pizza is getting better compared to years ago. Ok, that’s all for now .... going out for a slice or two."
2021-02-12 22:42:19,"Pizza for me has also been like learning a new language: Back in April I decided to try making homemade pizza for the first time. I’m not surprised that Domino’s and other mass market chains are pulling in the dough, but I also know many like me started learning about 00 flour, proofing days in the refrigerator, stretching, pizza peels, proper “launching” techniques and oven cooking steels - which generate more heat in a home oven. 

The result is I’m now making pizza that is better than almost anything I can buy on our pizza Sundays. But I’ve come to learn is that a simple thing like pizza to be executed properly is a very exacting science that takes quite a while to perfect. But it’s been very gratifying and it is made the quarantining much more enjoyable, bearable and delicious."
2021-02-12 22:44:24,"Food of the unlucky and poor in the past is now a global form of food art. Pizza is such a simple yet complex taste. The pandemic allowed me to master the dough, the sauce and the exact temp and time to bake. Little by little I am getting there. Lately I have come to appreciate how you can create an incredible pizza with minimal ingredients: Tipo 00 flour, good tomatoes, a decent mozarella and fresh basil. Gone are the days of me adding 8 different toppings when I ordered delivery.

2021-02-12 20:57:19,"I guess it should not come as a surprise, but it is saddening that those mass market chains have nearly half the market. I'd imagine it is well over half when you factor in Pizza Hut. That isn't to say the food is gross. They are all alright. Dominoes probably being the best out of the mediocre. I mean I think there is truth in the adage of sex being like pizza...even bad pizza is still pizza.  But also like sex, excellent pizza can be transcendent. And while I don't know about all places and perhaps I have been lucky, but everywhere I have lived seems to have a plethora of local parlors and some of them are simply fantastic in comparison to the ""big boys"". It was one thing when mass produced pizzas where also cheap, but with the exception of Little Caesars; they cost as much, or very close to it, of a lot of local parlors. So unless they have a screaming sale that simply can't be beat (or you want better than ""just"" pizza), search out the locals and more than likely I bet your tasted buds will be rewarded."

2021-02-13 04:17:22,"I can't believe a grad student just discovered pizza.  For years, a slice of pizza was dinner many a day  (skip the FF  -- those would have been lunch with a hefty serving of mayo)-- because it was fast, affordable, not too many calories with vin des Americaines   - diet coke.  A small MacDo costs less -- double cheesburger;or Wendy's chili with salad or baked potato.    I adore Wendy's chili-- not enough Wendy's in NYC  -- to which I add a can of rinse kidney beans, possibly some extra diced tomatoes from a can to increase the volume.  For some reason I do not make esp. good chili.. Altho the Tassajara black bean chili has to be one of the best, it's a lot of work.  (PS get extra hot sauce for the chili.)

As a child, we had pizza made with biscuit crsut-- semi-awful -- every Sunday night.  I don't make my own now, but if I add   Hawaian with pineapple.I like V&T's at 111th across from St. John Divine-- all good esp. with peppers and eggplant.

2021-02-12 14:56:54,"It didn’t seem to be much of a challenge to vaccinate members of Congress, the Administration-previous and current-and their respective staff. Not many of them are front-line health care workers or residents of nursing homes. Position and privilege still rule the day."
2021-02-12 15:00:09,"Nothing material has changed here with regard to the public actually getting vaccinated. Sounds like it's getting worse.

We now have the President talking late summer for full vaccine production. 

Why has he not invoked the Defense Production Act to require every Pharma lab and company immediately to produce the two viable vaccines?

And Fauci saying April to explode completely the fiasco of vaccine unavailability by allowing everyone en mass to join in chasing around non-existent appointments for inoculation. 

This will be really a great move - full vaccine volume late summer, mass rush to find non-existent inoculation appointments April.

Why hasn't  the President invoked the Defense Production Act to require Apple's Cook, Tesla's Musk, Microsoft's Nadella, Amazon's Bezos, ATT and Verizon to fix the disastrous supply chain and jumble of phone in and web appointment scheduling schemes instituted by state and local governments massively failing across the country?

Boy, sounds like another great Spring, Summer and fall in the great state of Pandemica. 

Looks like 2022 for any hope of normalization. 

Hope everyone is liking wearing those masks and ducking around the grocery store as their only foray into the outside world."
2021-02-12 15:03:45,"200 million... why not an additional 400 million? Or 600 million?

While I whole-heartedly appreciate the current Administration taking the pandemic seriously, the fact that vaccines will not be ubiquitous in nearly every  major pharmacy (i.e. Walmart, CVS, Walgreens, etc.) by LATE APRIL is highly problematic...

This roll out needs to be expedited, immediately."
2021-02-12 14:53:43,"""as early as April, any American could begin seeking a vaccine in an “open season” that would extend availability beyond priority categories.""

As a disabled 70+ who's on my state DOH's ""list"", I continue to watch under-65, non-essential workers  getting doses before my age group. This report suggests a continuation, even an exacerbation of vaccine-distribution chaos; a sort of free-for-all — get it if you can exert the necessary aggressive energy.

Narcissism can hardly be the basis for equitable and effective distribution. Not very heartening at all."
2021-02-12 15:33:15,"State and local health departments — many of which are underfunded or just plain incompetent — should not be controlling the supply once doses had been delivered. The government should be sending the doses straight to pharmacies and primary care providers’ offices where most Americans get their health care needs met. My PCP is literally five minutes drive from my home, yet she told me they do not expect to get any doses until the fall. Why are doctors offices not being prioritized for doses?"
2021-02-12 15:49:10,"Fully vaccinated individuals are still routinely tested due to university and travel requirements and contact tracing. What percentage are testing positive? This information is crucial for reopening our schools, as long as fully vaccinated teachers  are afraid they can still pass the virus on from unvaccinated students to loved ones at home. If just 1% of 11 million fully vaccinated individuals have been tested, that is 110,000 tests. Is anybody studying this important information?"
2021-02-12 17:34:17,"Here if you're over 65 or over 50 and living in an intergenerational household you're eligible.  It's not been that hard to get an appointment for at least a week.  Everybody I know who wants one and is eligible has already gotten the first dose (and that's most people I know).  But I've heard a lot of excuses for not getting one.  Some old people think that frontline workers or others should get it first so they're waiting, some are waiting for a single dose vaccine so they can avoid the second shot and some are waiting to make sure the vaccines are safe.  Lots of these people will never get a shot, in my opinion, and the numbers of ""hesitant"" people will increase rapidly as we move to less vulnerable people.  I'd be very surprised if even 3/4 of the adult population ever gets vaccinated but I guess if we have lots of extra doses left over later on, we can donate them to poor countries."

2021-02-12 17:25:18,"While I'll give some credit that it was a wise move to diversify our vaccine supply, it's still a stunning failure of Trump's that he passed on 100 million more doses of the Pfizer vaccine last year. While there have been problems with the distribution, the lack of supply against very high demand is the root of our troubles.

It would have been wise for us to have gone Canada's route, and secured more orders than needed for our population. First, it's a good hedge against unforeseen circumstances - such as the possibility we may need regular booster shots on shorter intervals than we anticipated. Second, if we end up not needing the additional supply, they would end up being a great force for diplomacy and good will for us to find ways to help friends, allies, or just people that need it and can't get it.

And, as with everything with the last Administration, the failure to use the Defense Production Act to drastically ramp up our productive capacity beyond the meager output we currently have was a colossal failure of imagination.

Oh, and it's nice to see a President (pictured here) actually using and encouraging others to take good, easy, accessible precautions. Republicans need to remember a lot of people, and a lot of them, would be alive and well today if they weren't so weak and vain in their devotion to idiots."
2021-02-12 16:38:13,"The Biden Administration simply exercised an option for 200Million doses that the Trump Administration had already bought and paid for.   60 days ago, when Trump was President,  the NYT reported these options as rich countries shutting out poor countries for vaccines.

2021-02-12 17:09:09,"The only logistical challenge to full vaccination is created by the attempt to turn a medical issue into a “social justice” battle. Everybody knows that the only ethical and medically sound way to administer vaccine is by age group. This is how it is done in Israel which is number one in the world in vaccination. You start with 75 plus, go down to 65 plus etc. Occupation, class, and race should play no part in it. Instead, the powers that be, especially in California, are trying hard to deliver vaccines first to “vulnerable population” (read racial minorities) without being accused of racism. As a result, nobody is getting it. The scandal of abandoning elderly Americans in favor of a misguided social justice platform will reverberate in this country for decades to come."
2021-02-12 16:44:07,"So, for the next 4 years, will Biden blame Trump for every challenge he faces?  And Trump will respond that it was actually Obama's fault?

2021-02-12 16:40:32,The Biden plan is the same as the Trump non-plan. The only difference is that Biden wears a mask when announcing it.
2021-02-12 15:44:17,"Health officials in the prior administration can push back all they want, but their excuses don't negate the fact that they didn't establish the infrastructure to administer the vaccine. That delivery network didn't exist except on local levels. Trump's guiding policy was to let the states handle it. In other words... he had no policy at all. Trump was a speedbump on our road to recovery."
2021-02-12 16:40:31,"I received my first covid vaccination yesterday at University of CA San Diego Health ~ UCSD. I am 66 and go there for glaucoma care. I was so impressed by the huge efficient system at the sports complex: parking dedicated to patients, helpers all along the walking route, a shuttle for the disabled,  a young nurse who explained everything, another woman who made my next appointment, websites how to report bad reactions, clean bathrooms! Other teaching hospitals like OSU could do the same, as could Univ of PA, if they are not doing so already.Also the County of San Diego has a sign up website for the vaccine. People bash CA but for healthcare it is the best place to be."
2021-02-12 18:00:29,"From well down in the article: ""White House officials have pointed to what they claim is their work increasing the weekly supply of vaccines by 28 percent. But those doses have resulted from an expected uptick in manufacturing."" 

Like so much else, this is political sound good stuff. The vaccine makers had already publicly stated their manufacturing expansion capability. The new administration did not make this happen. Additionally, the stated goal of 100 million shots in 100 days never met stretch goal criteria. The country was almost there before he took office & thankfully kinks in the rollout system were already being worked out. Sure more can be done & I wish the President & crew well."
2021-02-12 20:11:00,"More vaccines don't necessarily mean equity in distribution and prioritization. 

EXAMPLE:  Dialysis and transplant patients are not prioritized for the Covid-19 vaccine as they should be. There is no federal policy. There should be direct vaccine allocations to dialysis centers. Dialysis patients have extremely complicated schedules as it is. They shouldn't need to navigate hard-to-reach scheduling systems or have to travel to a third-party site for a vaccination.

Adding one additional hurdle to getting the vaccination means fewer dialysis patients will get the shot. End-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients are among the most vulnerable populations for poor outcomes of Covid-19, four times more likely to be hospitalized than all Medicare beneficiaries, with a 25-fold mortality rate from SARS-CoV-2 than that of other age-matched people on Medicare.

We need a national strategy in place to prioritize Covid-19 vaccine for dialysis patients. It's the right thing to do for patients, but it also eases pressure on the health system. 

Biden Administration? Are you listening?"

2021-02-12 19:13:38,"I just rolled my eyes when I saw Biden was sending out troops to help with vaccinations. We don't need troops, we need more vaccine. What good are a bunch of soldiers standing around without vaccine to hand out. There are plenty of health care workers who are perfectly capable of giving shots especially in the areas where the troops are likely to be sent."
2021-02-12 19:38:27,"This is a false summary of what is happening, as far as more vaccines are concerned.  Biden didn't 'secure' more vaccines.  Companies have been working around the clock for months to manufacture as many vaccines as possible.  The reached peak manufacturing in December, as planned.

I so wish we could read the news with an objective eye.  Very tired of the partisan flavor in every, single article.

As far as distribution to citizens.  The states are best suited to distribute.  They know where elderly, front line workers, healthcare facilities, and freezers are located.  They also know where Internet access is lacking, requiring a different approach for organizing vaccine appointments.

Many have screamed for months that the Fed should be running this show, but the Fed is not set up for that.  The resulting wasted time and money would be astounding.  We are a country of 50 states.  If states need assistance, they must have a central contact in the government (HHS, CDC, FDA, Pentagon?), but some states are doing quite well.  This will not happen overnight, and I for one am unwilling to swallow that Biden is 'making it happen.'"
2021-02-13 03:14:21,"At the end of January people in the Biden administration were complaining that 20 million doses of the vaccines were lost. Shipped to the states, but now unaccounted for. 

Since then, no one has said anything about those 20 million doses. This article says nothing.

Were that many doses really lost? Have they been found? Or was that just the usual political posturing that seems to masquerade as information these days?"
2021-02-14 13:29:17,This article shows great hope but also how fruitless our benefit system is. So many hoops to jump through and too many thresholds to overcome just to get barebones assistance. We can and must do much better than this. If we make sure that people can survive and thrive then we all will benefit as a society.
2021-02-14 13:47:05,"So many issues raised in this column; issues that have been debated again and again over the past year.  Does anyone really doubt anymore that we need a strong social safety net in this country?

However, as an aside, I'd like to know where the father of Ms. Stewart's minor child is, and why he doesn't appear to be paying child support.  I'm assuming that since it wasn't mentioned, she's not getting it.  If that is the case, then this article has uncovered a very old problem that should not exist for single parents.

There may very well be those who wish to criticize Ms. Stewart's choices.  Before anyone does that, however, they need to ask about the father who is absent from his son's life."
2021-02-14 13:48:31,"This is a difficult system but how do we make it better ? From the article at points 20% of Americans in Summer were on unemployment. All of those people flooding the programs at once are surely going to cause an already bureaucratic system to balloon even more. 

I do feel sympathy for the lead in this article- she lives a tough life. But also, should we as a country rethink our spending habits? She was at points receiving 600/week more than she previously made. Why did she need to spend it all and have nothing left for a possible rainy day?

Money was always an issue when my parents and I immigrated here. We came with 4 suitcases, made $1200 On my father’s graduate student stipend. $600 went to rent. The rest for food for a family of 3 and we saved some to send back to my relatives. I almost never went to restaurants. My birthday  present cost no more than $10-20. And yet I was still happy. 
Obviously I don’t know the lead person’s experiences or struggles but I do think it’s smart that as a country our citizens don’t spend everything from paycheck to paycheck and we learn as a whole about saving too. So that we aren’t always living hand to mouth and then get stuck when programs run out."

2021-02-14 14:03:14,"This story like many others is the end result of Reaganomics, Heritage Foundation, Citizens United and the ultra wealthy twisting and conniving our tax codes and laws to their own selfish greedy benefit.

2021-02-14 13:55:45,I am glad there was a safety net for Ms Stewart but this article points out to why there will always be poverty. Ms Stewart seems like she has a work ethic and that is good and she seems like she is a good mom but she also seems to be really bad with her money. There is only so much you can do for people when they won't help themselves.
2021-02-14 13:40:52,"The photos add depth to the problem. A woman buys chips, candy, and a bottled drink rather than food,  when her son may be nutritionally deprived but is not calorically deprived. She bought a video game console, and they have a smart phone, despite housing insecurity; her son is right. Money alone is not the answer to these issues. Family counseling and a life coach would help."

My niece suffers from mental illness & also frequently has panic attacks. A long range plan to help raise people like these women out of an endless cycle of poverty and hopelessness will also help to raise their children out of poverty. No one thinks of the emotional scars this also leaves on their children. My niece's daughter, began at the young age of 8 (she's now 13) to suffer from panic attacks & depression. Congress needs to stop thinking about themselves and Donald Trump & take some action to help people like this."
2021-02-14 13:55:44,"Wonderful article that speaks to the experiences of SO MANY Americans.  Eight people and three dogs living in a trailer in rural Michigan?  Heartbreaking.  There are so many across the country in this situation.  I teach students who live in similar circumstances here in Georgia.  And yes, their parents work.

Reading that Jack chided his mom for purchasing the Xbox they “could not afford” broke my heart.  But kids suffer poverty acutely.  We have the data on it.

We need a basic universal income in this country!  It won’t solve everybody’s problems, but it will solve a lot of them.  Raise the minimum wage and guarantee a basic income.  Model a program after the WPA.  Get young people active by offering a variety of opportunities to work and engage in their communities, rather than bouncing from dead end job to dead end job, spending all their energy scraping to survive.  The loss of human potential is monumental due to grinding poverty.

The fact is undeniable that the right wing of this country is totally devoid of any iota of kindness, generosity, or a basic moral compass.  However, the numbers are on our side right now.  We must act decisively and immediately.  The American family depends on it."
2021-02-14 14:37:38,"I think families like this need support from the government - no two ways about it. And we need to focus on HOUSING

But, the article raised a number of broader questions for me about how our society is structured and the impact that this has on this woman and her young son.

First, where is the ex-husband and father? Why have we created a society in which men can create children but not have financial responsibility. If he left her and their son then shouldn’t the law be structured in some way to give them better protection financially? While I agree that divorce should exist as an option, we honestly have an epidemic of it - and the result is a much higher number of impoverished moms and children than we, as a society, should have. This is a serious issue and a serious question on my part. (This analysis applies to her father, too, who seems to have abandoned her and her mom, leaving her, a child who was a good reader, without a proper education). 

I feel for the mother who is immunocompromised and did not want the daughter to work. But when the family’s existence also requires that work, I feel it was not the right judgment call. Before people say I am being harsh, the doctors and medical care personnel in my family did not have this luxury even though some are living with aging parents and/or immunocompromised family members. Her mother sounds a little selfish to me given that providing some stability to the 10-yr old should have been the priority for the family."
2021-02-14 14:52:58,"I feel a great deal of empathy for Ms. Stewart. The constant anxiety, homelessness at an early age, lack of high school education and foreshortened possibilities have been debilitating for her and in no small part are due to childhood trauma. 

One wonders if she ever received any kind of mental health treatment that could help her as well. 

The article also does a wonderful job of showing (1) the pain of millions among us (not just during the pandemic) and (2) our patchwork and at times quite inefficient and inadequate means of helping the poor and the children of the poor. 

We can’t end poverty or right every wrong. But surely we can do a much better job of blunting this kind of trauma and poverty to help everyone reach their best potential in our society. Remember, these efforts help all of us in the long run bit just those suffering."
2021-02-14 14:59:28,"This story cuts through the political rhetoric to show how badly our systems fail those who face challenges greater than they can handle alone. By all appearances, Ms. Stewart is a dedicated, hard-working and loving person who was simply born into a challenging situation from the beginning. She has faced and powered through obstacles that would crush many of the glitterati.

Imagine what she could accomplish with a safety net that allowed her to complete her education without worrying about where her next meal might come from, or worries about how she might need to repay the State of Michigan thousands of dollars she doesn’t have.

Now imagine the millions of other people in similar straits. We need to fix our systems to provide opportunity for people who can’t reach the bottom rungs of the ladder."
2021-02-14 15:05:11,"After reading this column today, along with Nicholas Kristof's column about his childhood friend Mike Stepp, it seems that in the rush to provide for the 1% by cutting taxes, that the people who need the help government programs provide have been forgotten.

My grandfather who came to America in 1908 used to say that that the Republican Party is the party of the rich man.  He died before Reagan became president, and his opinion of the Grand Ole Plutocratic side has been confirmed."
2021-02-14 14:49:17,"This sorry story illustrates the heartless cruelty of Republicans and the judgmentalism of far too many Americans. We live in the wealthiest country in history, yet people like Kathryn struggle with unpredictable employment and wildly fluctuating income. As several commentators note below, there is no better argument for a Universal Basic Income than her experience.

It struck me that she enjoyed reading Hunter Thompson and Oscar Wilde and decorated with posters of Salvador Dali. Hungry, clearly, for education, a system dismissive of the poor denied her a childhood where she could have pursued her interests and had an education she clearly yearned for -- and deserved. Instead she was sleeping on park benches as a teen.

Kathryn stands for millions of Americans whom our country has largely abandoned. It is long past time to stop with the righteous condemnation -- ""she should have saved her money, she shouldn't be buying chips [how many who excoriate her for that have Lays in their cabinets?],"" etc. etc. -- and pass legislation that assures such shameful disregard of our fellow humans never occurs again.

Let me add too that every human needs fun and relaxation -- a kayak on a creek, a hike, an Xbox are not extravagances but central to a happy and meaningful life."
2021-02-14 16:06:00,"I realize that I cannot put myself in her shoes because I am financially secure and have a roof over my head.  What struck me is the incongruity of the description of how Ms Stewart carefully budgeted to stretch money out for food etc, and the photo showing her son holding what appears to be an iPhone.  I think if I was having trouble making ends meet, an iPhone would be a luxury I would decide to do without."
2021-02-14 16:13:19,I admire Ms Stewart’s work ethic and maternal devotion. I don’t think the Xbox was an extravagance. It gave both of them a boost of joy that helped when dealing with otherwise depressing circumstances.

On a statistical note, the 2021 HHS Poverty Guideline for a family of 2 is $17,420. That's per year. One dollar over and you are no longer below the poverty line. Hmm... I imagine most NY Times readers would be hard pressed to even imagine subsisting, much less living, on this kind of income.

2021-02-14 14:42:23,"The judgment of many of these comments begrudging this woman and her son some small moments of joy is cruel. Her son is stuck hungry at home - a home that doesn't exist - all day every day, and she's ""wasting money"" on an Xbox? You see pictures of soda and fast food and decry a lack of nutrition - maybe that's all they had or could get that day the photo was taken because her truck broke down. Her family goes on a camping trip that couldn't have cost much to have a few moments to escape the grind - and that's a luxury vacation? As far as I can tell, she spent the money trying to fix up her life and create a foundation, and it wasn't enough. Because the money she got - even though it was more than she'd ever made - still was barely enough to live in this society. 

Shame on those who judge rather than empathize with compassion."

2021-02-14 14:45:34,"Clearly the United States has no common sense plan to help the poor lift themselves up.

Such a plan would include:

- The recipient's commitment, in writing and legally, to undergo federal government-training for either a USEFUL degree (anything that results in a job, not film studies or English) or a rigorous course of study in a practical vocation - - carpentry, masonry, electrician, plumber, etc.

- The recipient would then be provided a stipend for living well beyond a poverty level, to be able to afford shelter, food, clothing, and other necessities of life.

- The recipient would not be allowed to quit the program, unless for serious medical reasons. 

- If the recipient fails the course of study, another more suitable course is found until the person can acquire a set of skills that results in  a job providing for a wage that allows them to live with basic dignity - - NOT a $7.00 an hour job at McDonald's.

- The government can work with business to determine the types of jobs where there is an unfilled need among employers. Employers get ready-to-work employees they do not have to pay to train (sure they would love that, so their CEO can keep his five mansions and not have to pay to train his workers). In return, the government sets the wages and the employers cannot deviate and cannot lay those people off.

This is how we help people and yet get them prepared for the future. If I can plan this over a cup of coffee on a Sunday, why can't the US?"
2021-02-14 14:54:23,"Make a difference. But what does it mean. For some Americans, it means empathy, and the ability to see the other as yourself. For some Americans, the ones with no empathy, it means that your poverty has nothing to do with them, it's all your fault. For some Americans -- we all know who they are -- it means a cultural hatred. I would strongly suggest that this particular hatred is based on the very real fear that tomorrow morning, it cold be them. And, it could be them. Their very survival. There is another, badly articulated thing, beyond the cliche, that is the enduring hatred of any government (which is no government) whatsoever, and the love, sometimes passion, for the politician who stands for a fake revolution that would stamp the culture we share as a defacto obscenity. So where are they now. Waiting with the shivers. So brave. They, too, can face a retribution of authority which is not a government, either. The numbers game that our leaders play is similar to how they play the necessity of the filibuster game where the numbers of senators bow before their sewage kings. What simple majority matters when nothing matters. The Democrats love the filibuster game. The Republicans love it, too. What we are left with is a pox on both their houses. The entrenched poor among us are impoverished by one thing and one thing only -- they have no money-- and we are loathe to give anything away with our pretense that we have at last solved the hard things like child hunger.

But no."
2021-02-14 15:27:24,"It broke my heart when Ms. Stewart said buying the video game console made her feel like the kind of mom she wanted to be. For those critical of that purchase, think about how quickly children grow up. She wanted her son to remember receiving something extra special, something she normally would never be able to afford. It’s so easy to stand back and judge. Walk a day, a day, in her shoes. 

As a mother, I will not fault her. She’s doing her best in a horrible situation. I applaud her honesty. I would be severely depressed in same situation. Why can’t Americans help each other, provide supports for their most vulnerable? Why?"

For those who can't obtain a bank account (because they've damaged their credit), provide them with a debit card with access to all ATM's, without fees. 

There will be a certain percentage of people who will not spend their money well. It's likely that they don't now and they are already experiencing problems that are costly to society anyway. I think there's more dignity in giving them capital and letting them do what they want."

2021-02-14 14:44:19,"I am sickened (but not completely surprised), by the self-righteousness and callousness of these comments. This is a story about the feminization of poverty, a country which does does provide adequate  access to education or protect the most vulnerable among us. It is not a story about an Xbox.

I have a graduate degree and had previously taught as a university professor. I was a stay at home mother caring for my young child when my partner and co-parent abruptly left. I was instantly unable to afford our apartment and desperately afraid of who would care for my child when I went back to work outside the home. I survived because I could move back to Vermont and live with my mother in a solidly middle-class home. I had a graduate degree which allowed me bit to rebuild my career.
But it took years to recover financially. I had to declare bankruptcy. And I had every advantage. And yes, that first Christmas on our own I bought my daughter an American Girl doll I couldn’t afford. 

Shame on all the readers drinking their morning coffee casting judgement on this valiant young woman instead of the state of Michigan and the federal government. Governor Whitmer you are a woman and I’m guessing a mother —are you reading this? There are countries in this world that support mothers and families with young children. If we wanted to we could be one of them."
2021-02-14 14:40:15,"Many comments on this woman’s poor choices and lack of money management.  I don’t disagree, but my guess is these commenters didn’t grow up in poverty.  It’s hard to explain how one approaches life differently when they are surrounded by people who were not successful. My guess is that Ms. Stewart has no model of successful woman to follow.  My guess is that she lacks the confidence to even think she can have a successful, stable life.  I think UBI is a great start to giving people the stability they need to grow and make better choices."
2021-02-14 16:07:23,"This piece teaches us that our system only works for people who are educated beyond high school, and that it purposely overlooks and punishes those who aren’t. 

Ms. Stewart, you are a brave woman and I teared up when I got to this part: “She liked the literature of bohemians and rebels — Hunter S. Thompson and Oscar Wilde — but left school at 16 and lived in her car.”

As a librarian and former English teacher, this is the part of the story where I wish I could go back to this chapter of your life and intervene. I am sorry that no one did. So very sorry.

Over and over again I have said that Joe Biden could transform this country by making community college free for everyone. This might not sound like a big deal, but for a student who has little encouragement and supervision at home, it could mean the difference between staying in school and dropping out. 

For a student who is sleeping in her car, the knowledge that free higher education is there for the taking could change everything. We must do better."

We desperately need to fund a proper social safety net in this country (housing, education, healthcare and childcare) but if the idea is to put an XBox in every kid’s hands because there is no parental supervision and the XBox is acting as babysitter and makes the mom happy  we have a huge massive problem in this society."
2021-02-14 15:51:32,One of the big problems with social economic programs is the separation of state and federal benefits...as well as antiquate systems for unemployment benefits.

People have to learn that income assistance can be temporary and a hassle to fill out but a roof out of the snow and some basic food can save a child's life.
I do not know the rules in that state, but generally quitting a job disqualifies a person from unemployment compensation.
This person has suffered extremely and largely without cause because of a lack of information. It is sad to see people attacking somebody who is extremely down for their food purchase choices and not commenting on how medical bills have sent her into debt.

From her sad story of bad decision after bad decision, it seems she doesn’t notice much. She grew up in Michigan, where the economy has been declining for decades.

So many women do not file child support claims, and it's part of the equation of being afford to afford a child."

If we're going to run up the deficits, let's do so to fund roof repairs and less anxiety attacks for single mom's going without food."
2021-02-14 16:27:39,"I grew up like Ms. Stewart, and my early adulthood mirrors hers. The only thing keeping me out of the dire straits she is in is that I have stayed married to a middle class man. Kudos to her for her ingenuity and perseverance, and for her compassion. Giving up a job to protect a sick mother is a loving act. 

I am saddened to see people criticizing her spending choices. As she states in the article, you don’t know what it’s like being poor. It is grinding, depressing, and anxiety-provoking. It causes illness and is a public health issue. Any money she spent to make her life a little brighter (the X box, the iPhone) is money she spent on her mental health. 

Instead of poor-people shaming, why not reach out to her with the offer of a job and a stable place to live?"

The majority of the responses highlight one of the biggest problems we (dems) face going forward. Yes the last four years were a republican waste but prior to that we had Obama for eight years and control of Congress. What laws did we pass that would help people like Ms Stewart? I'll wait for the list in the comments...

If we continue to blame the republicans rather than own up to our own shortfalls under Obama and focus on the future under Biden then we will be in big trouble in 2022. We have 18 months with total control and need to forget about Trump. Either we pass laws (not executive actions) or the republicans will storm back in the next election.

Not a single human in this, the wealthiest country on earth, should ever have a single day of hunger or homelessness. Remember when you complain about tax dollars being invested in social programs that the average American making 50k a year only pays something like $35 a year into them. The vast majority of our tax dollars are used for military spending and corporate subsidies (welfare for the rich). We are all infinitely closer to being in Ms. Stewart's position than we are to being millionaires or billionaires. @nytimes, please consider providing a link to a fund-raising platform or create one yourself for this woman and her child. There are many compassionate NYtimes readers who would love to contribute what they can to her, myself included."
2021-02-14 17:01:52,"What stood out to me in this article about Ms. Stewart:  she is really trying.  She has one son, not five or six from various men (yes, it happens out there in the real world), and isn’t sitting sround bemoaning the fact she isn’t getting enough benefits.  She’s trying to work, whatever job she can find, working during the night to be there for her son during the day.  She used “extra” unemployment money to make repairs to her car, her mother’s home, by herself.  She quit her first job at the request of her mother, not to bring Covid home.  A good move?  Maybe not, but it led her to a higher-paying job.  She is learning to make lemonade out of the lemons our government and society represents.  Should she be struggling this hard, living in poverty?  No.  But she represents hope to me, someone who is still striving, working, being a mom, being a daughter.  Buying an Xbox for her son is the least of the problems of this story."
2021-02-14 16:58:29,"What did she do with the extra money she received weekly from the government for months? This is textbook poverty cycle. She needs education and information on her situation and a trade. I am sorry but a lot of people ""blow"" the money because they don't know better: beer, liquor, designer clothes, phones, nails, hair, electronics, etc. I grew up in a socially economically depressed neighborhood and most are trying to keep up with the Joneses and waiting on a next income tax refund and selling food stamps. I know more people from my old neighborhood who traveled on unemployment checks this summer and posted it on FB. They are living at the poverty level: government paid housing, food stamps, etc. stuck in poverty cycle but oblivious b/c it is their way of life."
2021-02-14 17:28:02,"The easy out:

Point to the iPhone.  Point to the Xbox.  Pat yourself on to back because you are not in Ms Stewart’s shoes and walk away.  It can never happen to you.  You must maintain that belief you can make decisions that keep you safe.

But not buying something expensive doesn’t change the outcome in this story.

Years ago, before two degrees and a life that included finally giving up my child to my ex because all I could give him was poverty and uncertainty, I was Ms Stewart.  I know her inside out.  Yeah, we had a Christmas tree.  None of your righteous recommendations regarding her life decisions would change her story.  To be a single mother in America, without family financial support or independent wealth, is to live in poverty and uncertainty. You take your moments of relief where you find them.  There are very few.

When women, like me, began studying in retrospect why they were so poor, they observed the only thing standing between most comfortable white women and total financial destitution was a man.  When the man leaves, poverty follows.

And, despite all the fragile, questionable progress women have made in this country, this is still true for almost all women in the United States.  Not so in many European countries, certainly not in Iceland, but here.  Our country treats single mothers like so much offal.  

In the thirty some odd years between my story and that of Ms Stewart, nothing’s really changed."
2021-02-14 16:28:16,"What is the point of giving aid if states are simply going to try and claw it back again later? I cannot fathom the stupidity, venality, and utter lack of empathy embodied by the state’s position."

Meanwhile, 3 white collar moms, 2 with husbands get all the sympathy in the world for their predicament.  No one asks why they are in homes that require 2 incomes to pay the mortgage. 
Honestly,  this reaction is why people vote Trump.

While they debate and cajole with each other, millions of Americans don't have enough to eat, and don't know where they are going to sleep tonight. Every single member of Congress should be required by law to go hungry 5 days a month or more and be limited to $10.00 spending money a week. Then they might get it and get off their high horses and actually strengthen the safety net instead of ripping holes in it so they can keep their cushy jobs and homes."

2021-02-14 15:51:25,"As opposed to providing assistance that offers numerous benefits, both literally and figuratively, officials like Sen Paul and Cruz would rather end it and classify Americans like Ms. Stewart as “lazy”. They’re as heartless as they are incompetent."

2021-02-14 17:45:42,"Change the formula and stop basing safety nets on being only for the lowest denominators and maybe  more Americans would support more generous safety nets. 
Other countries have social networks based on the fact it is the right of every citizen. In the United States responsible people are denied help when they hit hard times which is why we have so many in this nation against social programs.

Single people, couples with no children or those who supported their children but hit rough patches are often denied during their need. Instead everything goes to those who are reckless with their lives and actually get rewarded with more for their recklessness.  Even people who come here illegally and have several children can get more assistance than a hardworking single American adult who faces a crisis.

One of the reasons politicians hate social security, while Americans love it,  is because it is a rare safety net that benefits only working  people who actually paid into the system. It also has a set formula based on work history and everyone  contributes equally to both social security and Medicare. Politicians can't mess with it to benefit certain groups over others. Have more programs like social security with clear defined equal  contributions and benefits for all."

Yet you judge that buying the Xbox would get her through difficult times."
2021-02-14 17:32:50,"“I’m an empath — if someone else feels bad, I feel bad.” 

I know she wont be reading this...but Ms. Stewart needs to understand that this ""empath"" thing is only her aligning herself with the narrative that she is sharing some sort of cosmic fate with others.  We all feel bad when others feel bad, but we cant adopt those emotions - because they are not ours to own. We cant adopt the bad feelings of others and make them our own. Thats how people get pulled into cults and other like-minded groups. Its how the poor and underprivileged remain in a state of self-defeat. Its how many fail to recognize opportunities for themselves, because they dont feel worthy. ""If these others around me are feel worthless, I should too! I don't deserve this win.""

Its a form of group-think, that especially works against the poor and disadvantaged. ""I'm one of them, and they all say X, so I must be X.""

You'll never hear successful people say such things...""I'm an empath."" Because they know, either intuitively or thru experience, that adopting the ""problems"" of others as their own is self-defeating. It become a burden, its not a gift. They may make helping those others a worthy goal, but they wont adopt the burdens of those self-defeating feelings.

Its not easy to toss that stuff away. Because staying in that mind-set is comforting, its familiar. 

I hope Ms. Stewart sees she has a tenacity to survive and its hers alone. The piece hints at an intelligence that needs to be nourished, not burdened."

2021-02-14 17:44:48,"Trump's betrayal of his office and his dereliction of office has destroyed the economy and thrown millions upon millions of Americans into massive debt and homelessness. Anger about this must be directed into the determination and persistence of non-violent civil disobedience at the vulnerable GOP members  in 2024. But now we  face the new crisis of the new poor and new homeless being exposed to COVID in homeless shelters. This will mean separating new homeless families from the long term chronic population of homeless and possible exposure to drug-related problems as well. It means immediate action by Congress and state governments.

As Biden begins to overturn some of the trump damage to the nation we must recognize and respond to the the realization that the new poor and the new homeless, as well as the chronic homeless who are among the most vulnerable Americans."

2021-02-14 17:05:43,"Thanks for this great piece illustrating the humans behind the debates. Reading the last 3 paragraphs, I hope Ms Stewart comes to feel empowered enough to understand that her vote can affect the ability of the government to help people like her."
2021-02-14 17:34:53,"This is difficult for me to read.  My parents died when I was very young.  Luckily I had older siblings to move in with and social security and a small VA check for support.  That got me through part of my bachelor's degree until Reagan ended the social security benefits which made life a lot tougher.  I, like Ms. Stewart, sometimes did not know where my next meal was coming from.  I ended up getting a doctorate and I have now contributed back to Social Security far more than I received then, and glad to do it.  Had the government not helped, my outcome could have been much worse.   I wish Ms. Stewart continued success.  Hopefully the present administration will set us on a better course."
2021-02-14 17:38:01,"In fighting the overpayment claimed by Michigan, Ms. Stewart's defense is that she gave honest answers to the questions on her application and her state paid the benefits. At least for the Federal Supplement, having to quit for reasons related to the Pandemic, like living with eight others including a mom with medical vulnerabilities and a son who needed her care, she is entitled to the benefits she received. She is not liable for an overpayment. An employer cannot contest benefits to an employee forever. He had ample opportunity before she was paid for so many weeks. Unemployment benefits are not a disincentive to work. The Earned Income tax credits, employer paid health insurance, a chance to save for college and for retirement, a sense of purpose and contribution to society, time off, extra money to pay bills and have a few luxuries are far more of an incentive to work than not to. This narrative of raising the minimum wage which is 12 years neglected, must happen and should happen all at once. Employers have been skating on the backs of poor worker pay for far too long and people like Ms. Stewart and millions of others have been accepting of it and making do for far too long. It is also a reason that people work for cash and that is more ruinous to our economy in  lost tax revenue than a paultry 15. an hour minimum. In states where it may cost some less to live, pay 15 and in states where it costs more to live pay 20. This Pandemic has laid bare that it can be done."
2021-02-14 17:46:36,"Temporary, sporadic patchwork payments don't solve problems.  The cost of short-term fixes for long-term needs (healthcare, childcare, education, unemployment benefits, public transportation, infrastructure) likely exceeds the cost of providing those programs and services.
The US is something akin to giving drivers money to repair their tires and shocks because of terrible roads instead of fixing the roads."
2021-02-14 17:58:55,"Ms. Stewart demonstrates an ethos of ""push on"" in the face of circumstances that might easily trigger despair. We, as a society, owe better care to those in need and we have failed to make it a priority—we permit massive offshore banking loopholes for corporations to evade US taxes, while chasing poor people likes rats across the tundra to claw back unemployment benefits.

This underscores the argument that it's not the size of government we ought to debate—how do we make an ""effective"" government."
2021-02-14 18:47:22,"We have an issue on the left, where we have bought into the right wings ideas of means testing aid. Rather than wanting to ensure it doesn't go to the ""Undeserving"" non-note poor like conservatives think , we don't make a great counterargument that we also want it to go to poor white people. We must show that we want universal prosperity, not to just ""shift"" who's the in group and who is the out group.

I hate to say it, but on the left we need to highlight how Democratic programs will help Trump supporters. How it will make a material difference in their lives, but also deliver real tangible results. The white working class people that scream about the government overreach will probably go quiet once they see something like $1000 a month UBI hitting their accounts. Does it feel right as a liberal? Sending some angry racist $1000 a month? No, but we need to push past that and adopt universal programs without means testing if we ever want to have a society that functions fairly."

They, at least, understand the concept of mutual dependence and taking care of one another. Resources are shared. People understand that the survival of one, particularly children, is the survival of all. In losing that ethos we have become the true barbarians and the ravages of the pandemic have exposed those fault lines for anyone that has pretended that they don't exist or ignored them. Shame on us."

The little boy in the story is the true victim at this point.
2021-02-14 19:19:39,"I’m not sure what the solution is.  Last spring unemployment was there for 3 months until NYS reopened and it was a god send.  However, I directly know of 8 people who continually file for unemployment and collect while working cash paying jobs.  It’s an open joke and they advise others how to do it.  Giving out free money has never worked.  There has to be a more comprehensive solution to help when needed but not have people exploit the system."
2021-02-14 18:31:24,"In our country, 40% of all babies are now being born out-of-wedlock.  In some cases, the parents live together even though they are not married.  There is a good chance that these parents will have split up by the time their child reaches kindergarten.  

Children in single parent homes have a greater chance of growing up in poverty.

Ms. Stewart was married when she gave birth.  Her husband left her and contributes nothing to support his child.

One way of helping all single mothers, whether they were ever married or not, would be for the federal government to track down and require fathers to pay child support."
2021-02-14 19:09:02,"My heart goes out to her. This story so clearly points out how close to edge are the poor, where even a $10 bill can be overwhelming.

Thanks to Mr. Jason DeParle for this moving story."

And while some parochial cynics cite “social Darwinism” as the cause for successes and failures, I see nothing naturally economic that dictates the fate of Ms. Stewart (or the tens of millions just like her). Her situation was artificially created and sustained via inadequate public policy. 

Unchecked greediness makes vulnerable people succumb to their American fragility. The line between home and homeless is more like a sieve. Where the gaps are—no one knows except for those who inevitably fall through.

I wish Ms. Stewart the best. I was homeless for more than a year and I’m finally getting things back together. There is a way out of poverty even though it may be unjustly limited."

2021-02-14 17:54:37,"I also received unemployment in Michigan this past year. Recently I received a questionnaire from the state asking me a series of questions about my willingness to work, ability to take any shift offered, asking if anything prevented me from taking a job immediately, etc. There was no explanation for why I had to answer these new questions in addition to the ones I already answered every two weeks. More concerning, the questions were ambiguous. For example, I take care of two young children, so I wouldn't be able to accept a job without first finding childcare for them - did that mean I technically couldn't accept a job immediately? I searched online for guidance, and that's when I found other people warning that the questionnaire might lead to my aid being cut off and being asked to repay what I'd already received. The questionnaire felt like a trap. Apparently my answers were considered ""correct"" in the eyes of the state and my aid has continued. But I can see how other people might have answered differently without the help of the online forum I found, and face huge bills as a result."

That was a mechanical world, connected, but the signals were not so dense and hot. A telegram was social media, and it involved a series of couriers. It is impossible to understate how distinct this era is.

And in 2020 the greatest challenge perhaps of modern society in general -- how we live, how we work, certainly how we even feel about each other -- happened to coincide with the non-existence of a functional US government.

A missed historic moment of unprecedented disappointment. Instead of coordination, we got don't worry bout it. Instead of unity we got LIBERATE MICHIGAN. Instead of a smoothly operating nation responding to an emergency, we tried to feel good and be as kind as we could but half the country thought it was a plot to be unfair to their furious leader.

Even if it were an Apple, there are huge numbers of used older models out there. There are also budget prepaids available. This lady probably is cellphone-only for all her communication needs (as am I, and prepaid too). Two things she doesn't need are a landline and a collection of board games to play with her son.

2021-02-14 19:01:41,"Excellent piece that really helps get to heart of many issues, but, like an onion there are many additional layers that impact multi-generational poverty.   While the sentiment of ""personal responsibility"" expressed by some is somewhat understandable, it is misguided. It is not lost on me that the reason that my spouse was able to stay home when the children were young, is because I get to go to work and provide the Prozac, Zoloft, Celexa and Buspar (and occasionally Ativan, Valium) for the anxiety and panic attacks that Kathryn experiences.  I have Suboxone for when the pain pills get out of control, I care for the ""unintended"" pregnancies and do my very best to engage the needed social services to ensure the best outcome.  

My Kids have an x-box, iphones, ipads and organic food, their potato chips are organic and produced in small batches (is that better?).  While I worked hard to get to where I am and to provide for my family, I also understand that I have and continue to have a lot of privilege.  

I do hope we can do better as a society, we can get upstream and do a lot more good then me and my colleagues can with our prescriptions and referrals, but first we need to stop with the blame and understand that we are truly in this together and are all better off is their is adequate social support.

Also most of us received these these funds, but not all of us needed them.  While it was nice to get a notice that our bank account had additional funds, being retired and already comfortable, we didn't really need it.

But those people also need some predictability.

If politicians and agencies cannot agree how much working people or disabled people should receive in payments, food allotments, food stamps and/or rent assistance at a given point in time, how on earth can they expect the recipients to sort through arcane and inconsistent regulations?

2021-02-14 20:51:19,"Ms. Stewart's story is a microcosm of the collective choices made by the US as a country and Americans as a society.  These choices are made possible because of the deep white racism aided and abetted by ignorance and fanned by the symbiosis relationship between the moneyed elite and political class to preserve their status.

Ms. Stewart's can be a story of any American poor, lower and middle class, regardless of races and ethnicity, who is one or two paychecks away from being destitute and homeless.  That this is happening in America, the wealthiest country, is an unavoidable indictment of the racist, cruel and inhumane economic and social systems perpetuated by greed and selfishness.  It's depressing because the conditions for story such as Ms. Stewart not only will not change, but they are becoming intractable by tribalism and white resentment."
2021-02-14 19:28:24,"Why such drama over a XBox? Just like adults children have stress their frightened, seeing mom stress over bills food sheltar. She never mentioned physical medical checkups.

I hope she votes next time around. Because there are those who truly don't care and by the stroke of a pen well the story speaks for itself.

I hope she invest in a laptop even a used one take some classes see herself in the future.
For herself and son. Break the cycle of proverty.

2021-02-14 20:53:12,What this article highlights is that help and aide is inconsistent to poverty stricken individuals.  The system is fickle and this places additional stress on individuals.  We need a system that is consistent and predictable so that people can plan and allocate funds accordingly.
2021-02-14 20:54:39,"The anti-government pro-free market Republican Party meant that if Trump led a national effort via the Federal Government to minimize the impact of the pandemic, he’d be blamed of imposing big government solutions and risk his support among Republicans. If he’d taken the responsibility, he would have gained a lot of support from independents. But he bases his politics upon opposing the government and the established order. He would have lost all credibility in that respect. 

He retains his base, lost the election, and the country suffered far worse from the pandemic than was unavoidable."
2021-02-14 21:12:21,"It's expensive to be poor. This is not a woman who wants to be lazy and not work. She wants to support herself and her son. She wants to work hard. I'd like to see some of these Republicans who think stimulus and unemployment encourages laziness live on an unemployment check for one week. And don't forget, since Ronald Reagan, people have to PAY TAXES on their unemployment payments. Who can less afford to pay taxes than the poor unemployed? Reagan made that decision as he was lowering taxes for the uber wealthy. We had to take in our niece, who's now 39. She's disabled, intellectually and physically. We are 72. We have a small ranch house. She would be living in the streets. We discovered that she attended the January 6th ""event"" in Washington, DC. She didn't go into the Capitol building. But she went to support Trump because she's a ""patriot."" She's gone full QAnon, and she says she doesn't want ""her taxes"" to pay for lazy people. She gets SSI disability and pays no taxes on it. She hates socialism but doesn't understand that she receives the benefits of socialism. She pays no rent here. I'd much rather be housing this woman from Michigan who has a sense of responsibility than my own relative who's on the Marjorie Taylor Green train."

There are more than enough desperate American citizens in America. We don’t need more imported from other countries."
2021-02-14 21:11:57,"An x-box is more than a game box these days. It is the most effective way her son can connect with his peers, because, they’re all socializing on it, believe me. 

It is a way to connect him to his generation’s collective experience. It is a way to break his isolation, especially during covid times.

Her priority to go without food so she can give all these connections to the person she treasures the most is an exceptionally beautiful gesture. It is also part of her story that’s heartbreaking while being heartwarming, too.

It also speaks to her sense of hope, that even though that was hard and required sacrifice, she made it happen. What else can she make happen given her success on this one during a string of discouraging, significant setbacks? That’s a stone cold victory in my opinion.

I wish her and her son continued success."
2021-02-14 21:37:06,"@ Greeley 

To those asking where is the father?  Where indeed.  Wherever he is, if he is as poor -- and also suffering from panic attacks --  as she is I am not sure he would be a great help to her or their son."
2021-02-14 21:45:00,"Thank you for publishing Ms. Stewart’s story and for sharing what it’s like to be poor in America. Like Jack, I grew up the only son of a young single mother, alternately relying upon meager paychecks, public assistance, and the generosity of others to get by. We shared a cluttered, one-bedroom apartment and at times had no car. Most Christmases my mother would tearfully apologize because she couldn’t afford to put more than a few small gifts under the tree but one year she splurged and bought me a Nintendo. I was elated, of course, and it made her feel like a good mother, though she still cried because she knew the better life it represented was still always just out of reach.

I’m 39 now and through my mother’s efforts, some hard work, white privilege, and a bit of luck, I have a steady job, stable housing, and good health. But not every child of poverty is so lucky. Now where can we send money to Ms. Stewart and her son?"
2021-02-14 21:35:33,Story after story features single mothers with no help from the fathers of their children. That is the theme that should be captured and changed.
2021-02-14 21:39:21,"The $10.00/hr gas station job that she left, due to not wanting to expose her health compromised mother to Covid, was not enough to live on independently. A living wage and affordable housing would have helped. She was eligible for the Pandemic unemployment under the rules. Now they want it back?

Shame on those in this comments section for blaming the victim."
2021-02-14 21:47:15,"There are so very many people who have next to nothing. They live, they die, mostly in hardship. No one, no government body really serves their interests. But they serve as the beacons showing us who we do not want to be. The disenfranchised are the boundary holders who instill the fear of homelessness, and simply seeing their hardship makes us all vulnerable to all manner of exploitation. Raise the poor out of poverty, raise the minimum wage to a living wage and not only will hardship be softened for the have-nots but the lives of all working Americans will be made more prosperous as corporations are forced to share their wealth fairly with the governments who provide them infrastructure and with the workers who provide them labor."

2021-02-14 21:33:17,"Government's assistance, as valuable as it may be in stressful times, is something no one can count on at any given time; a bit capricious, depending on the 'humor' and open-handed benevolence of the so-called political representatives in Congress. It is not a given. Understandable of course, given that most congressmen/women are millionaires, likely never having suffered from poverty: hunger, lack of shelter, despair...and never able to walk in the shoes of the least among us. So, instead of exercising justice, no more nor less, they may view their spending money on the poor a waste of time and effort, hardly comparable to the 'goodies' awaiting them if they could maneuver lowering taxes for the 'rich and powerful' (facts, just facts). Did you notice the wide inequality between Wall Street and Main Street? Noxious, right?"

2021-02-14 22:08:52,Poverty is a disease.  It is chronic stress.  Every kid needs a smart phone and this young boy needs a lot more than that.  Why is it always so easy to criticize the poor - the one social group forever stigmatized.
2021-02-14 22:21:00,"She sounds like a bright, hard-working person.  

It seems to me that it all boils down to her own childhood - she didn’t have stable parental figures to care for, and guide, her development; or to encourage her in her schooling, etc. 

 I am so eternally angry at folks who create children without the ability (or desire) to provide those children with the basics that all people need and deserve. 

Please, if you have some nurturing/parenting inclinations but can’t (or don’t want to) make the huge commitment that a human child requires, adopt an animal from the local shelter. You’ll stop this cycle of human hardship and misery, and help a needy animal."
2021-02-14 22:14:04,"I count two absent fathers here, yet no mention of where they are and why they chose not to support their children. 

This is one of the issues that needs addressing - the media just ignores fathers and their critical role in the family, poor or otherwise."
2021-02-14 22:22:31,"Until this country lives up to its promise as the world's richest country, we will continue to have people who are injured by the rigid structure of a torn social safety net.  We need to think strategically and consider long term consequences to families and especially to children. It is not only kinder, it is cheaper to provide ample assistance, especially in times of crisis, than to leave people to fend for themselves, hoping they find food and medical care when they need it. Judgment should not be part of the process."
2021-02-14 22:25:43,"An incredibly complex story told very beautifully. I love reading through the comments as they’re just as complex and interesting. 

I’m glad she bought an Xbox and hope it was an iPhone. Didn’t she buy kayaks too? We all deserve some fun and excitement in our lives, and frankly these are small things. Childhood goes by fast and I splurge too for my kids because I want their memories to have bursts of happy memories.

Are there signs in the story she doesn’t make good financial decisions. You bet. Is she uneducated. Yes for sure. Is there a deadbeat dad. Yep. 

In the light of this story I agree we don’t need more illegal immigrants. Sounds like her whole family needs low skilled jobs."
2021-02-14 22:25:39,"Too often this is what we don't hear or read about;  the people who are helped by government interventions and then harmed when those interventions end or are, as what happened here too, arbitrarily taken away despite the need.  Our governments spend more time and money ensuring that a person is entitled to receive even a small sum of money, put so many roadblocks in, that it's a miracle anyone at all is helped.  

I keep thinking about the people who are not as lucky as I've been.  I've lived through extended unemployment several times.  Luck was on my side because I had no outstanding college loans and the last time I was living with my elderly mother (and I still am).  Why am I in my mothers home?  Because of a distinct lack of affordable housing in my area.  Translate that to the entire country and you have a large number of people at risk for homelessness.  

I'd prefer to see my tax dollars go towards helping people stay in their apartments or homes, to receive needed medical care, to be able to leave their children or elderly relatives in high quality day care so they can work rather than the shortsighted solutions we use now.  Government can be a force for good.  It can help people especially when families do not have the necessary resources.  And receiving help doesn't take away the urge to work to pay for things unless one has been too beaten down."
2021-02-14 22:27:36,"Disgrace that in a country as rich as the US, which thinks nothing of throwing away trillions of dollars on the military and police forces, people are living like animals.  Keep squeezing and pressing people like this and you're going to see an uprising in this country.  This abuse and exploitation won't be tolerated forever."
2021-02-14 22:35:34,"I hope the assistance that comes in the next year is based solely on 2020 income and true need, not necessarily the boosted income that was State and Fed govt aide or 2019 income. 

This year has shown many that didn’t know before, the glaring issues. In trying to get assistance they want you to prove that you fall in specific categories and often times you have to be making under 12K a year. It’s crazy, and those on a fixed income as well. Cost of living goes up but the rest including a living wage does not follow. 

Also the job market is flooded in many areas and even when applying it’s like 600 people for the job that prior to the pandemic might only have 50 applicants. Making it to 2nd and 3rd rounds use to mean a shot. Also the issue with being a or being around immunocompromised in your home and not feeling safe working with the public. The the static that majority of recent unemployment is women —- assumed to be women who are caring for family members."
2021-02-14 22:29:24,"I commend this young woman for her courage to persevere in a country where the poor are left behind.

2021-02-14 22:40:41,"Throwing money randomly doesn't really solve the underlying problems. The government has invest heavily in public corporations, civil service, etc. grow the government again, or work through some public-private model so the best of both worlds is used, but you need to not only give fish to the people, but also teach them how to catch fish."
2021-02-14 22:47:31,President Biden is correct to keep a laser focus on the millions of Americans still suffering. With the virus still causing havoc and a very cold winter upon the nation many need help more than ever before. Yet we still have many elected officials that want to take their time tinkering with the President’s relief bill and trying to cut it drastically. These Americans need help now. Stop the political gesturing as lives and families are at stake. Send the help now in step with fighting the virus and pushing to get our economy moving forward. The entire country will benefit. And that is what the Biden Administration is working for.

2021-02-14 23:16:39,"America has the wealth.  It just doesn't have the will to share it appropriately.   It's shameful, honestly.  Having more the enough makes people selfish.  Having just enough keeps your heart open."
2021-02-14 23:29:17,"I have lived in America for 25 years and I am still shocked about the absence (aside from food stamps) of a safety net for poor Americans. Nobody has to live like this in Central Europe and neither should Americans.  I just hope that Biden's plan to provide low income families with monthly financial support for children will ease some of the hardship. 
I have worked with children living in poverty. What I have observed is that poverty is an underlying stressor that not only affects well-being but also the ability to learn. Growing up in a poor household with the lack of food, perhaps shelter, and with parents suffering from mental health issues sets you back tremendously. No matter how smart your are."
2021-02-14 23:31:05,"This is a classic example of why we need universal income. Bring the poor up with money and subsidized jobs.

I eat them too and aren't they delicious, but a better choicer is to buy  smallish bag of potatoes, cut two or three potatoes in half, smear with a bit of oleo or whatever you have, sprinkle with salt, and if you have them, add a carrot or several to bake and you have a cheap delicious meal.  If you can, add hamburg bought on sale.

Hope this helps."

2021-02-15 01:11:39,"We are entering what I feel to be a dangerous period for our nation.  The rich and powerful are pulling farther and farther away from everyday life.  Meanwhile middle class and poor are forced further down the economic ladder.  The safety nets that most other civilized nations take for granted either don't exist in the US or are so tattered that huge numbers of people slip through.  We can't afford to pay a living wage but we can afford to be at war in Afghanistan for 20 years,  spending $ Billions per year to accomplish nothing.

Our criminal justice system is harsh on people of color and we commit crimes against humanity on our southern border, but if you are rich and powerful, you can literally kill a cop with your pet thugs and walk away.  

Looking back through history almost all countries with this sort of gap between rich and poor, the powerful and the weak, either failed or were taken over by a Tyrant.  We are on that same path, it is not yet too late but it is getting very close."
2021-02-15 01:23:27,Thank you to Ms. Stewart for sharing her reality and to journalist DeParle for writing it down. She must have known that her honesty would make her vulnerable to the judgment of others. Her strength and empathy are my take aways of the article.
2021-02-15 02:05:51,"Why is this so hard to understand?  People need money to live in America.  Enough to cover rent (including water, heat & electricity), groceries (and yes, occasionally eating out) and health-care.  Money for clothing and the occasional toy for themselves & their children.  Try that on $7.25 an hour.
We'll go through all sorts of contortions (food banks, rental vouchers, paperwork to ""prove"" you are deserving of aid), anything but ensuring a decent wage."
2021-02-15 02:11:10,"There are wooden boxes in my area that have canned goods, non perishable foods and can be taken by anyone, no questions asked. It’s the “honor system”- someone in theory could take all of the food in the box (about the size of a port a toilet) but they don’t. I put food in myself today. The person maintaining these boxes states their intention is for meals for people who are the working poor- they mostly have a job but find themselves short of food with too much “month” remaining on the calendar before government food benefits reload. Are people likely taking food that don’t meet this intention? Maybe- but if the woman in the article and her son get a few decent meals out of it, it’s certainly worth it. I’d like to think the majority of the food I put in today went to people in similar situations- I put some in last weekend and will do so next weekend. There certainly are a lot of worthy conversations to be had on the government’s role in the safety net- but each of us who is fortunate to be employed, have a warm house, and food in the pantry could do a lot of good by finding one of these boxes and putting in some dried pasta, soup, canned goods, crackers- they would make a world of difference for someone like in this article."

We’re gonna need you to cast an abundance spell real quick, and that back to us.” What is the matter with people? That should never happen. Ever. There is nothing more important than empathy and compassion. 

I think the wrong people are millionaires. If I were a multimillionaire, there is nothing I wouldn’t do. I was actually married to a terrifying but wealthy man at one point. The only thing we had was money, and it brought me joy and satisfaction to share it whenever I could. That’s what you’re SUPPOSED to do with money! Well, again, he’s an awful, violent person. He’s now in prison where he belongs, and we are finally safe, but I’m also now one of those ‘less fortunates’. We are on Medicaid, and I buy our food with a Bridge Card. I no longer have a car after a hit and run a few summers ago. Just a series of unfortunate events. My mom helps, and I freelance where I can, but I haven’t made enough to qualify for any kind of unemployment or regular aid. That stimulus check is it, so when the rich toy with whether or not to even cut that check, it’s pretty scary. I don’t think people realize that folks like me are out here.

I never pictured myself here. I was halfway to a science degree at U of M when I encountered my biggest obstacles. Things are really tough for some people, you know? I’m not sure why that is. Why some have everything while others always seem to struggle? Who knows."
2021-02-14 19:12:20,"You feel helpless when you’re being helped by the government.”

Should another crisis arise, she said, “I hope the government has a better plan.”

There's the rub, either you depend on government to have a better plan, or you get a better plan yourself and leave the government out of it like working in an Amazon warehouse.

2021-02-15 03:10:57,"Why does it take a pandemic for the government to 'really' help people?  In the story, once she starts receiving money, she pays off bills, repairs her truck, finds a job, makes her son feel good, and helps repair her mother's home.
(Wow, that was money wasted....right?)

So which is better?  Having the woman remain poor, depressed and probably on the welfare full-time, or helping her stand on her own feet?  What did this cost, $12,000 dollars?
I think it was money well invested.
Does Ms. Stewart know that she probably qualifies for the free college here in Michigan?   I hope someone has told her it's available."

2021-02-15 03:58:11,"“The political calculations were lost on Ms. Stewart, who grasped only the lost aid. “I don’t think any of them really understand about being poor,” she said.”

“Nearly a year into the pandemic, profound differences separate the parties’ views of the safety net. But those differences get lost at the distance from which Ms. Stewart views politics. She strongly favors neither party and did not vote in November.”

It’s really hard to feel sorry for people like this when they have this line of thinking. One party wants to help and the other literally wants to leave you to die, yet you’ve got people like this woman thinking they’re the same. How do you even get through to them if they can’t see the difference at this point?"

Not to mention the absurd long hours and poor improvised facilities and endless lines of people looking for tests.  I wouldn't have done it myself."
2021-02-10 12:23:35,"I have often been puzzled why the US doesn’t put the unemployed to work doing public service jobs rather than simply paying them to stay at home on unemployment.

These people are fighting back and carrying on just as their families did during the Blitz.  Quite a few parallels from the book and today’s fight against the CV19.  But we are turning the corner -real strength, real leadership, real engagement and a plan makes all the difference as the article notes with these real people and their stories.  Semper Fi"

We have the perfect one to hand. We should be organizing our societies to vaccinate everyone in the world.  At the same time we can use the opportunity to do good in other areas such as water supply, agriculture, education and even internet availability.
What an excellent time to provide our young people with a way to channel their energy and skills, all the while knowing what they do is vital to the future.
This pandemic will not, repeat not, go away until the world is vaccinated and the virus has no human hosts in which to replicate and mutate. Let us accept this fact and use the window of opportunity to do good."

(They would normally have built all the tents for the big music festival we have each summer... but they were there with their own material ... for their fellow citizens instead.) 

University and High School students on vacation, choral & sports groups, scouts .... all kinds of young people came out to help (earlier taking groceries) and lately getting people through vaccinations, even picking those up who have no cars ...

It took less than 30 minutes, 15 minute pause included, to get everything done and a time & date for the next vaccination. 

All  thanks to efficient planning, information gathering  and specific times given in advance. It can be done ....

Is it population differences by geography (as suggested in the article, and may be at the heart of why regions experience massive frailty variation)? Is one study entirely wrong and the other right? Or do another set of factors explain the studies’ differences? We do know that outcomes massively vary, and there are a reason for this variation. We still don’t know why."

This study does not specifically address their role. The fact that activated T-cell lymphocytes are less persistent than IgG antibodies could account for a higher level of such lymphocytes in children who are more frequently infected with common coronaviruses. There is still a potential role for common coronavirus in ameliorating SARS-CoV-2 infection through activated T-cell lymphocytes."
2021-02-10 15:59:44,"@Cathy.  Not quite clear why your comment starts with “wow.” I get the sense that you felt something was being hidden by leaving the qualifiers and remaining unknowns to the end.  Research rarely yields the headline-worthy findings that the public demands. Scientific knowledge is frustratingly incremental. It is standard, orderly protocol for research articles to present the question they address, reveal their findings and discuss potential confounders and residual or new questions raised by those findings."
2021-02-10 15:49:20,You’re not as protected as you thought you were. Great!  Let’s print it!  Another premature study that only offers a scary title with no conclusive findings to support it. What do we do with this information?  Lockdown of course.

Unfortunately, the antibodies are over 6 months old, so no way to tell if it was actually Covid-19 or another of the coronaviruses versions I must have had in the past. Bummer..

Data I can't seem to find.. How many of us would test reactive for these antibodies? I would think the majority? My chart showed the normal result as ""non-reactive."" Huh?"
2021-02-10 19:59:57,"The article is trying to report scientific results, but it is hard to follow.  I'm not sure that the author understood the two studies.  I found the paragraph about the 251/251 study most confusing.  In determining whether there is antibody protection it is vital to count the number infected but not symptomatic, and that appears (to me) to be omitted from the article."
2021-02-10 18:15:06,Well done research.  Now all we have to do is convince the anti-vaxxers.  Good luck with that.
2021-02-11 00:59:06,"I am all for vaccines but this study seemingly only tested for the gamma globulin antibodies against the common corona virus virus in a test tube against the Covid-19 virus.
The immune system has a memory that includes multiple functions including production of antibodies which decrease in quantity after a vaccine or infection.
But the T Cells remember and can be activated quickly to mount a defense and then tickle the pre programmed B Cells to make more antibodies.
I am not saying that exposure to the non lethal Coronaviruses does or does not provide some protection . 
I am saying this study proves nothing predictive in the real world of the human immune system."
2021-02-11 03:24:13,"Thus continues the fascination with (and illogical focus on) antibodies as the be-all and end-all of the immunity.  Yes, cellular immunity is much harder to study but without a clear investigation into this area we are only looking at part of the picture (breathless media headlines to the contrary).  COVID-19 is here to stay, becoming endemic in the population is an expected outcome at this point.  But if cellular immunity means subsequent cases are only mild, then the world gets to go back to ""normal"" eventually and it becomes the 5th coronavirus strain in the broad population.  By the way this is also how every other Coronavirus behaves.  Stop focusing on antibodies and drawing incomplete conclusions which are they reported as fact- study the full picture."
2021-02-11 15:31:30,"I recall an excellent article from a couple of years ago about how vaccine research has slowed to a trickle because there was no profit in it. A good example of human short-sightedness.
This is also a good example of how regulation and legislation are needed in an increasingly complex world.  Legislate that Big Pharma take a portion of their grotesquely large profits and dedicate to needed research. 
Let's hope this pandemic becomes a lesson we don't soon forget."

2021-02-11 18:58:11,Great article. But I wish it had mentioned the challenges in such research. The trick is finding the sweet spot. Too specific an immune response and a vaccine works against only one virus. But too general a response and the vaccine has the potential to start working against self antigens. That’s what appears to have happen with the swine flu vaccine in the 70s that ended up causing Guillain-Barré Syndrome in some of the people who received it. I’ll hasten to add that the problem with the swine flu vaccine was that it was introduced far too quickly and without adequate testing. We’ve learned a lot since then.

Now, wrt public health monies, can we please put some effort into ""non-lethal"" viruses that always seem to be placed on the back burner? Surely if there is hope to pan-vaccinate against corona variations, we can discover a pan-vaccine against the viruses that cause chicken-pox, shingles, and all those socially-stigmatizing herpes virus variations. Having watched dear ones struggle for years with shingles, prior to the recently targeted vaccine, and one young, beautiful woman commit suicide after learning she had HSV-2, I do wish we'd stop fooling around. Technically they don't (usually) kill. Physically and emotionally they leave a lifetime of scarring. It's not a ""shiny object,"" but one shunned as a result of old school moral nonsense.

How about we set a rule that the U.S. defense budget can be at most one and a half times that of the next highest country? We then take the remainder and funnel it into medical research, including cancer research. The federal government then retains intellectual property rights to any primary research it funds in order to recoup some of that investment when the resulting technologies are commercialized.

Right now we have concurrent pandemics of CoV, HIV and Hepatitis C virus and it is unclear which virus or microbe will trigger the next pandemic. It could well be the Influenza pandemic that could result from a re-assortment of RNA segments that form the complete Influenza genome.

The 2 burning questions right now in my state of Kentucky are 

1) When are adults below the age of 65 who are eager but NOT public school teachers or University faculty and staff going to receive a vaccine against COVID-19?

2) Considering that currently there is a high demand and scarce availability of the Pfizer and Moderna vaccine, how long can those who have had the infection but have since cleared the virus for at least 60 days and considered as cured put off getting the vaccine to boost their already acquired immunity?

My 1st question will be answered by those who are manufacturing the FDA allowed vaccines and those like J&J awaiting FDA approval. I assume by end of Mar. everyone willing to receive the vaccine can get it at their local pharmacy.

The answer to my 2nd question is dependent on what level of antibodies to SARS CoV-2 are protective. I have researched this a bit. If a person acquired robust immunity following infection and has high level of antibodies then they can hold off for 90-180 days."

Instead of trying to search for a pancoronavirus vaccines, perhaps these scientists should look at scientific evidence and call for the abolition of animal use and exploitation.  That would be far more effective than any vaccines as almost all diseases in human history have been zoonotic, meaning that they jumped from non-human animal species to humans due to the humans’ exploitation of animals.

Antiviral drugs specific for coronaviruses in preclinical development 2nd July 2014.

Coronaviruses are RNA viruses that cause systemic diseases in humans and animals. • 
There are no approved drugs for the treatment of coronavirus infections. • 
Several SARS-CoV inhibitors, with known mechanisms of action, have been identified. • 
These inhibitors stand as promising leads for coronavirus therapeutics. Coronaviruses are positive stranded RNA viruses that cause respiratory, enteric and central nervous system diseases in many species, including humans. Until recently, the relatively low burden of disease in humans caused by few of these viruses impeded the development of coronavirus specific therapeutics. However, the emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), and more recently, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), has impelled the development of such drugs. This review focuses on some newly identified SARS-CoV inhibitors, with known mechanisms of action and their potential to inhibit the novel MERS-CoV. The clinical development of optimised versions of such compounds could be beneficial for the treatment and control of SARS-CoV, the current MERS-CoV and other future SARS-like epidemics."

Especially with signs all over campus requiring mask wearing and physical distancing.

Especially with City government and the police department being well aware of student behaviour after a Duke/Carolina game.

But alas no. Nothing changed from pre pandemic days.

2021-02-09 12:51:30,I live in Ann Arbor and it’s amazing how our local news outlets don’t report the details about the cases of the covid 19 variant in our communities.  The local news either downplays the clusters or publishes the news a couple of weeks after the fact.  Seems like the UM regents control the news.  It’s wonderful that they don’t control the NYT.

In the fall, I was impressed by the seriousness and rigor the university applied to reopening. I wish I could say the same about spring semester. Unfortunately, the good habits appear to have broken and the strict enforcement widely publicized in the fall appears to be absent. Students gather in close groups in the dining halls, crowding around single occupancy small tables for lunch. No one appears to be enforcing the rules. I’m not worried about myself - i can choose not to go there. But it’s irresponsible to allow that kind of behavior to risk the health of the employees and their families."

But thanks to the selfishness of these people who just can’t bear to follow the rules, it’ll likely be at least another year before I can go home and see much-loved elderly relatives who may not last that long."

The opening paragraph says it all on safety and college students:

""...student who returned to the University of Michigan after winter break carrying an unwanted stowaway from her trip to England..""

Irresponsible, me-first college students...a dime a dozen. Doing their job being who they are. Some selfish student travels to another country during a worldwide pandemic, then returns with the variant of the virus. Me-first students are on every campus across the nation, and they put the majority of safety-conscious students and faculty at risk. 

Trump did not prepare our nation, did not focus attention where it needed to be focused, and didn't get our health care system and supply system ready for the onslaught of this pandemic. That mismanagement, coupled with his messages galore on how worthless masks and social distancing is, guaranteed we would be where we are right now. Since me-first college students are on every campus in the nation.

Biden is saddled with Trump's numerous mishaps on preparation and response for the pandemic's onslaught. Hopefully Biden will be able to turn around our nation's deep fatigue and despair with all of the ramifications of this pandemic, and turn us around.

But for now, and the foreseeable future, it's not yet safe for students and faculty, anywhere, to return to college."

Going ahead with the game and then expecting students to sit out the celebration is naive and frankly a little unfair. The game should have been canceled this year but I’m sure the revenue was too good to pass up.
2021-02-09 14:07:53,"I am a recently retired college professor. There are excellent online courses available for many undergraduate courses (even lab chemistry courses). The courses are designed by groups of educational experts and put together by textbook publishing companies. Many of the courses available have every bell and whistle that can be imagined. It is up to the instructor to select material that can be reasonably completed in a semester while providing the needed course knowledge required. The most difficult part is getting the students to self-motivate and pace themselves on the course work. These publishing companies develop a better course than I or other faculty alone could ever achieve. The key is student motivation. Online courses can be great for undergrad courses and in reality, should be less expensive than in person courses. Zoom can carry many of the graduate seminar courses. This is going to be the future regardless of what administrator claim. Bricks and mortar are too expensive and Zoom can provide most of the one on one contact students and administrators claim is needed."
2021-02-09 14:20:31,"Is it possible that the focus of vaccination should shift to the young, those who are more gregarious, less risk averse, and less likely to come sick. If they are the ones who seem to be causing the greatest levels of transmission, should they perhaps be the ones who need to be vaccinated most? And since mandatory vaccinations are not without precedent (measles and mumps to name just two), why should Coivd vaccine not also be mandatory? I wonder if we don't have our priorities backwards."
2021-02-09 14:31:32,"I have worked in education for over forty years---in all forms of schooling---middle school, high school, university. In all of these forms of schooling, all school environments, from classrooms to hallways to libraries, to dorms, ALL are designed to spread an airborne virus. So, when I hear that tired phrase from politicians, even physicians, that in-person schooling can be done safely, ""under the proper CDC guidelines,"" tells me that these individuals have long forgotten what the schools they attended are like--they are crowded, they are in constant movement, they are enclosed, they are not well maintained, they are host to adults, some of which have pre-existing conditions, and young people who are highly social and highly fearless. Until we reach the level of immunity from the vaccine, pushing schools personnel to open up their doors is throwing the dice on the safety of staff and students."
2021-02-09 14:47:00,"The problem isn’t just some students refusing to follow coronavirus protocols and more contagious variants. Your article briefly mentioned the financial burdens of testing but did not adequately delve into the different approaches colleges and universities are taking to control the virus.
Schools that mandate more frequent testing for all students and surveillance testing have been more successful, even with more in person classes. 
As long as politics and money are the primary concerns, rather than public health, student and school faculty and staff safety, the coronavirus will continue to disrupt higher education."
2021-02-09 15:13:19,"All the people screaming for opening up restaurants, etc. should read this article.  Travel exposes people to the virus, close quarters encourages the spread of the virus.  Many of us have lived in isolation for over a year and access to vaccine is not happening in a competent manner.  Until EVERYONE follows the mitigation protocols - limited socialization, distancing when around others, masking, and the ever necessary hand washing - there will be no hope of getting the virus under control."
2021-02-09 15:22:07,"This reporting fails to take into account the excellent public health measures that many universities have instituted. One look at the online Tulane COVID-19 dashboard today shows that they very quickly got the initial back-to-campus surge under control this winter, just as they did in the fall. With a robust program of testing, contact tracing and isolating (along with masking and social distancing) Tulane has done a spectacular job of managing in-person education since this fall. Their leadership is to be commended for making a decision to prioritize education (and student mental health!) while remaining flexible and transparent throughout. I am grateful my child is a student there."
2021-02-09 15:30:22,"As the mother of a music education student at a SUNY school, and a resident in a town with an expensive private school, the difference money makes in the testing paradigm is all too apparent.

Students at the private school were, as of last semester, tested 3 times a week, and were able to attend in person classes. Students at my daughter’s school are tested once a week, in batches, with one of the lower cost tests(a saliva test, as I understand it). Any student displaying any symptoms at all is given the higher cost nose swab test. 

Students at my daughter’s school spend much of their time in their dorm rooms, attending classes remotely - participation in music ensembles is significantly curtailed.

New York State has a 15 billion budget hole, but I don’t see how we are to navigate opening restaurants to indoor dining(No Thanks!), and in person education without much greater testing and contact tracing. For all of Governor Cuomo’s laudable action during the pandemic - his administration has failed in this regard. In consideration of the unbearable slowness of the vaccination rollout, I find this lack of initiative inexplicable."

2021-02-09 15:21:05,"I share some views and some sympathy with all posting here, and with students, staff and management of universities. So long as they are dealing with university campuses and college residents. I live in a small town in England that houses 7,000 students of a university 8 miles away. In Sept-Nov last year this quiet town had a sudden influx of young people from all over the UK and the world, using its shops, buses, pubs and restaurants. Suddenly we had suddenly had some of the worst Covid-19 community tranmission, with the local residents bearing the brunt of the consequential illness and death: even now our local hospital has 50% of its beds occupied by Covid cases. As long as students mix in a HE world, there are issues; as long as they live in the local community the questions far transcend anything educational or academic. The town that is our home has been devastated and we are told at the same time we must not ""blame"" the students -- and we do not, we blame the self-centred higher administrators of university and government, who gave us no thought and refused to listen to argument. Students have in fact garnered the worst of all worlds, as the whole UK attempt to move quickly to normal after the first peak crashed, and the universities have remained without students so far thsi year. But even as they impose extraordinary quarantine on travelers, the governmentplan to ""restart"" university in-person teaching in March. Will I have had my job by then?"

2021-02-09 14:25:05,A student who traveled to England or anywhere during break should have been barred from campus until it was determined she was not infected with any strain. Students should give up their travel if they want to be in person on campus.  They should be willing to do that or give up their place on campus. It’s called being a grown -up.
2021-02-09 15:21:40,"Colleges and universities are currently super spreader events in action. My colleague’s daughter attends a college in Boston. After spending a semester at home, she decided to return. Within just a few weeks her entire hall of her dorm became sick. She was the last to get Covid and is now very, very ill. And there are so many sick students that the staff can’t keep up with ensuring they are each cared for. It didn’t have to happen this way. She and other students should have stayed home."

An on campus student I know tested negative two weeks running, her father visited and the next day that sniffle she was feeling tested positive. The father is now quarantined alongside the mother and sister. The mothers work colleagues may be at risk because of the office they all work in, the coworker is terrified of the exposure possibility to their 85 year old live in mother. 
This virus does not know college boundaries and will spread where it can. These colleges have reopened because economically they have no choice. COVID 19 will take total advantage."

A rough calculation suggests that 400,000 infected college students of a total college population of 20,000,000 is 2%. Overall, the infection rate for the U.S. is about 8% (from the Times database).

As an Uber driver, I was pleased to see my rides pick up drastically - except I quickly saw where a lot of my trips were going. Bars. Restaurants. Social gatherings at Greek houses and friends'.

And then there are the real rule-breakers. The ones who take off their masks after they get in the car because it's after dark and they know you're too busy watching the road while you drive to monitor them in the back seat and see that they're acting like adults instead of entitled children. The ones who try to bribe you into letting more than the three passengers you're limited to carrying in the car, and letting one of them ride in front with you. Or not a rule-breaker, but inexcusably clueless, claiming the virus is really not a big deal because ""it's mostly old people"" - which I guess is why it's shut down the entire globe. No, no big deal. Really.

You tell them you drive health professionals, people with underlying conditions, the elderly, whom you want to protect. They don't care. You tell them one of your passengers had an autoimmune disease. They don't know what that is.

I guess that's why they teach kids to think at college. Because it's a skill that they haven't yet learned and don't know how to do."

2021-02-09 16:24:00,"The COVID-19 Crisis has exposed the fundamental truth that American universities and colleges have become hotels and resorts as far as their economic viability is concerned. Faced with decades-long decline in federal and state financial support as well as deeply “discounting” tuition to provide competitive financial aid packages, including merit scholarships, to attract domestic students, the only side of the house that reliably provides revenues is in housing and food services. Make no mistake about it: the rush to bring students on campus has nothing to do with education—schools with endowments and state finances to survive COVID-19 have gone exclusively remote learning. Schools that have insisted on on-campus modalities have risked the health and lives of their faculty, staff, and students for the privilege of locking the students in their dorm rooms as the pandemic rages around them and infecting tens of thousands in the community. The sad thing about this is that without the millions of dollars generated by beds in dorms and dining services, many of these institutions will risk financial ruin or debts that will take decades to make up."

Students have been advised to not leave their residences except for meals and medical appointments.

Shaming is toxic to public health and only encourages deception and taking social gatherings ""underground"".  Public health experts are understandably frustrated, but humans cannot live a monastic life for very long, due to the basic human need for social contact. This is especially true for college students who have been massively impacted by lost experiences and shattered opportunities during the pandemic. Almost a year into this, the fact that covid is not an ""equal opportunity killer"" has made it harder to enforce lockdown rules which prevent college students from seeing other people. In Massachusetts, of the 14,000, covid deaths, two were under 20 years old. 64% were over 80 years old and 65% were nursing home residents. For better or worse, this reality shapes how people behave, especially young people who derive meaning from connection with their peers. Now that the over 75 yr old population is being vaccinated, the overall hospitalization and fatality #s should rapidly decrease. Vaccinating the elderly is the way out of this, not shaming college students who are trying to launch their lives."

Also, did you notice that despite these new variants which you shove in our face every time you can, Covid cases are down 60% from their peak from 5 weeks ago and continue to drop like a rock?

Stop punishing young people in order to ""protect"" older people--older people who if you bother to ask them, don't want young people punished on their behalf."

The ""official"" death count is 465,072. If the NYT article from when the count was 140 something holds true the actual number is 30% higher. So over 600K people dead just so some people who already have more money than they can ever spend can have some more money. And probably another 600K before this epidemic caused by willful (intentional IMO) inaction is over."

That is the community police and those communities appparently like the $$$ of student spending more than not.
2021-02-09 20:59:51,"My niece and at least a dozen of her friends from a Latin American country stopped in Miami to party on the way back to their U.S. college campuses for the spring semester. Somewhere between their home country, Miami, and the various universities they attend in the US (including, but not limited to, UVa, American, Tulane) several of them contracted coronavirus. 

Now, they--and spoiled, selfish college students like them--are spreading covid 19 all over the United States. With their parents' blessing and funding, in many cases. The universities must have known this would happen. But they turned a blind eye. 

Again, the pandemic shows how selfish the vast majority of us are. (And, I am including myself in that group, because in the interest of placid family relations I have refrained from addressing with my niece or my sister my niece's partying in Miami in the middle of a pandemic.)"

The ""choice"" the administrative bureaucrats gave was to return, or to stay at home and do online classes while the majority of friends and classmates were on campus without them. To a young person, this was no choice at all . While crafting a ""personal responsibility"" narrative to offload liability, the college is playing Russian roulette with the lives of students and, especially, faculty. When the smoke clears, we need a reckoning: These overpaid and underwhelming people, especially those in ""student affairs"", have seized control of universities from faculty over the past thirty years. Despite their smarmy claims to care, they don't know students, and they don't care about faculty. It's long past time for change."

2021-02-09 18:36:09,"Why now? What has changed between last March and the beginning of these clashes between Lightfoot and the teacher's union? Why did ending remote learning become such an imperative in the middle of the worst surge of the pandemic so far? Pinning the hardships these kids are facing on the teachers union when they are advocating for the safety of their members is ill sighted. We already ask teachers to do so much, risking their lives without adequate protections is a step too far. It's a shame a lot of kids are having a ""lost year"" that is the reality of this pandemic. There are alternatives our policy makers can come up with to make up for it with just a little bit of creativity including accelerated programs, weekend classes and extended summer school to get kids back on track when everything is safer."
2021-02-09 19:51:32,"Is it really so hard to reopen schools? Catholic schools in Chicago have done it, in similarly aging buildings and with a fraction of the investment that CPS has put into its schools. Over half of the country's schools have reopened, too, in a variety of places. Masking, handwashing, and ventilation (either by opening windows or using the air filters that CPS has already bought) are enough to get this done. The CDC, WHO, and virtually every school in Europe have made clear that vaccination is not necessary to reopen schools safely.  European schools have not even reduced their classroom size, or required masks of all children, like Chicago has committed to doing. I feel sorry for the children caught up in these old fights. Adults need to come together, acknowledge the evidence, and give kids the option of returning to school."

The stress on the families, childcare costs, etc have been grossly underreported by the NYTimes.  The same goes for the data that shows little children are of little risk.  Times readers (myself include) excuse Republicans of burying climate science but when it comes to science that runs counter to union demands, well that's an inconvenient truth."
2021-02-09 20:55:19,"There has been a lot of national reporting on districts like Chicago and NYC. What has gotten less attention are the large and small districts that are f2f or both f2f virtual and have been so since August, September, October.

Some of those districts have managed well. They are small enough, wealthy enough, or plain lucky enough to have avoided major issues. Or, they worked diligently to implement the original and revised CDC recommendations.

Then, there are districts like mine. We have about 115,000 students. While, officially, only 60-65% are back f2f, my own school has over 80% back f2f. Some campuses have 95%+. We did a phased in approach, but didn't adjust that based on case numbers as each phase initiated. We required masks...except for on the bus and recess and maybe not PE and certainly not while eating lunch in small, poorly ventilated classrooms. We pretended we'd do distancing, putting up stickers in the hallways, but classrooms are so full, there aren't enough desks, let alone room to distance in many cases. We spent CARES Act monies on a (poorly designed) CMS, not PPE, supplies, or staff. We're hemorrhaging subs and most schools have had to resort to teachers covering for other teachers during their planning. We closed f2f for a week in January not because numbers spiked, but because so much staff was out on quarantine or actually ill. Three educators have died. District cases average over 300 a week. It is a mess."
2021-02-09 21:59:30,"As a physician and CPS parent, I completely agree that those individuals teaching my child need rely on scientific data and not on their own perception of risk. Of course there’s is risk in returning to school. And - what’s the risk of continuing remote learning when it’s such a failure for so many students? I went to work every day this year with my kid trying to learn at home. I did not get to vote about whether I wanted to take the risk of going to work in a pandemic. The pandemic is an act of nature, not controlled by the government. I think policies and processes can mitigate risk, but CTU is asking for the moon. There is a natural disaster and you want to ensure no risk to your personal health? I can not remember any other time in my life I did not support a union action. This us the first. Demanding vaccines before other essential workers and refusing to return to classrooms that are safe if everyone is masked is ignoring the data and the risks of not returning."
2021-02-09 23:35:04,"Schools need to open for all the children whose parents can’t deal with them, for whatever reason. Children who need specially trained aides, therapists, nutritionists, and counselors. Children who often need special transportation.  Children whose parents cannot or don’t feed them or keep them clean, who need coats, backpacks, even clothes. School is a refuge also for the neglected, abused, badly treated. Children who need a chance. Keeping up with some artificially set curricula is the least of what these kids need."

Of course she didn't.  Of course the teacher didn't.  Of course the governor didn't.  It was the VIRUS.

People must take a step back, holy cow.  Louise, like all of us, even those with disorders and/or less-able to take on Bad Things that happen, must learn the hardship of CHANGE and that things happen and can disrupt.  There are ways to mitigate the negative reactions to change someone may have/experience.  And parents and teachers and Whoever the Big People are who are Emotionally Intelligent can learn them and put them into play for their loved ones or for those vulnerable who are weaker and need the help with whom they are in contact."

Is it impossible to agree and apply policies balancing risks, needs and benefits down to group or individual level, with both pupils and staff?

Everywhere that vaccination is being rolled out we've got the situation of several months during which illness and death increasingly becomes avoidable, with the burden of protecting the most vulnerable and need for 'lockdown' measures to limit spread and transmission easing. But not suddenly or evenly even within particular areas."

There is literally not a single person in any store without a mask, in fact, even seeing an incorrectly worn mask is unusual. Kids are masked. People walk their dogs and ride their bikes in masks. Our local testing is fast, free and easily to access in numerous schools and other centrally located areas. Targeted quarantines minimize the number of school closures, and the district has hired classroom monitors to supervise classrooms when a teacher is quarantining at home. Middle and high schools are open in a hybrid arrangement, and classrooms built for 30+ kids have only about 10 kids, who can easily socially distance. Our positive test rate has been below 5% for many weeks.  It's a community effort that needs the buy-in from everyone, teachers, parents, administrators and students, to work. (and this is a district of approx. 31,000 kids, so not a tiny suburb district)"

There is a simple solution, vaccinate the teachers.  Of course this cannot be done.

Isn't it easier to explain the medical/safety problems and discuss the repercussions than to have to explain the death of a teacher?  We are all in this together and need to care about each other instead of only ourselves.

2021-02-10 16:09:28,"As a CPS parent, I'm beyond tired of the CTU and CPS combat. Parents are not viewed as a stakeholder and the CTU narrative doesn't serve teachers well at all. I've always been impressed with teachers who maintain a classroom culture of respect and collaboration among students, honoring critical thinking, compromise, and not tolerating bullying. Their union doesn't reflect any of that. 

A group of parents started a facebook group, Chicago Parents Collective, organizing to promote parent voice, which has been non-existent. Screen shots of individual parent comments (with names) were quickly shared on CTUs facebook page, and the CTU made false claims that the group was funded by right wing conservative groups. That's how the CTU operates. Intimidation, bullying. 

Chicago teachers, families, and kids deserve better!"
2021-02-10 16:25:44,"It very frustrating that educational policy for our public schools is effectively being determined by the teachers unions. Unlike elected officials, they aren’t accountable to voters and parents. They also seem pretty quick to dismiss the harm being done to children that pediatricians are speaking out about. If the union leaders don’t think education is an essential service, they need to find a new line of work."
2021-02-10 16:13:03,"I am yet to see real scientific study   showing kids are immune from Covid 19 and they do not expect any harm in future should they get Covid 19 infection.
Also there is not proper  scientific paper  showing how the Covid 19 can be stopped  in school settings . 

What the  city admins are doing are showing its not a super spreader  place  .. ""funny"" when they themselves are sitting in their home doing ""Remote Work"" ! 

In big cities like  NewYork and Chicago   where going to school also means getting food , its a nightmare handling teh amount of kids coming. 
Please do not give me junk mentioning  ""European school model""   or ""parochial school model "" they are paid and has about  50% less kids per class to start with .

2021-02-10 16:16:26,"From the moment Trump foolishly bellowed ""open all the schools"" last summer, the teachers' unions decided that ""opposing Trump"" was more important than ""following the science"". Public health experts told us many months ago that schools were reasonably safe and the societal cost of keeping schools closed outweighed the benefit. Despite this public health consensus, the union and many influential media outlets clung to the ""schools aren't safe"" mantra with a near religious fervor. In our town, many teachers who have been vaccinated still oppose in person learning until all district children are also vaccinated. By demanding a zero risk/zero covid solution, the teachers' union has undermined the credibility of it's many hard working members while also inflicting great harm to schoolchildren. There are no winners."
2021-02-10 16:19:22,Straight out favoritism. These teachers don’t deserve to be pushed to the head of the vaccine lines. Shame on Chicago for caving into them and shame on the teachers for demanding preferential treatment.

Are the parents stupid? Should Black and Latino parents ignore the history of substandard education for their children in many districts? The Times needs to stop attacking teachers and grapple with how schools can be safely reopened."
2021-02-10 16:33:51,Where are the voices of Chicago parents who fought against these plans because they know that CPS can't be trusted to ensure safety and know these plans will result in diminished quality for their remote learners? 80 percent of families opted to stay remote.

I also told them that I expected them to do well in remote learning.

I also support their teachers and if I were to undermine their efforts in front of my children, then my children certainly would not do well in school.

I support educator's right not to die in the line of work.  63 teachers have died in Houston - and 37 children.  They can't argue that is school is not safe, because they are dead.

Further, with new mutant strains, I do not believe school is safe for my children.  I do not want to risk complications such as permanent organ damage or long COVID.

My daughters are not returning until they can be vaccinated.  Their long term health is more important than being in a school building."
2021-02-09 18:53:28,"Four of my younger relatives, who have been attending either in- classroom elementary or middle school in the states of Georgia and Florida, have contracted COVID-19 since the new year began. IMO, Chicago teachers should be fully vaccinated and their students should be tested regularly as preconditions for reopening schools safely."
2021-02-09 22:59:55,"Teachers, on the one hand, and parents and others, on the other hand, may have a different analysis of the costs and benefits of returning to classroom teaching.
The teachers' position - which they don't necessarily explicitly argue - is that even if there is one death of a teacher (or student) as a result of in class teaching due to the transmission of Covid-19, that loss of life is not worth the educational gains to millions of student due to in-person teaching.  
It's an awkward argument on both sides.  Parents and kids don't want teachers to die but they feel (for the most part) that a return to the classroom is necessary for pedagogical reasons.   Teachers don't want kids to regress or fall behind in their education but they don't want to die or suffer irreparable harm in going back to the classroom."
2021-02-10 17:31:14,"What's clear from watching CPS, LAUSD, SFUSD and other mega-school districts during COVID is that schools have become too big.  They have failed, repeatedly, during the pandemic because of pressure from the unions and trying to pander to the lowest common denominator. Decisions regarding students should be made in negotiations between parents and teachers they pay with their tax dollars, not by union heads or city or state-level administrators.  Some states, like Vermont, have passed reforms allowing schools to withdraw from these districts and re-form under local boards--I will vote for any politician who will move similar legislation (or a ballot initiative) forward in California."

The science shows that the best interests of children and their families are to have in-person learning, and that in-person learning can be done safely with protocols that have been established and proven effective. But Randi Weingarten and the AFT have decided to ignore the science and worse, to use the pandemic as leverage for pay and benefits. Please spare me the self-righteous responses and anecdotes -- interests of students and their families, not just teachers, need to be considered in these times but the public schools once again have made teachers' interests paramount."

2021-02-11 02:05:59,"I think it is clear that it is better for children to be in school than at home (guess we aren’t big fans of homeschooling....) if we can accomplish that safely and by minimizing risk, and by accepting that there will not be zero risk.  

Teachers/school staff and retail/grocery workers (along with others who work in a profession that requires interaction w a significant number of people daily) should be at the front of the line for vaccines, along with the elderly. My own elderly mother said she wishes she could give her vaccine to a teacher, if only there was a way to do that."
2021-02-09 14:38:34,"This is exactly when NYT needs to investigate and hold our politicians' and government employees accountable for such poor preparation.

Then I received an email 5 minutes after it had been sent from my state assemblyman informing me that there was a popup site near me. In that 5 minutes, by the time I got on the site, all appointments were gone. I despaired of ever getting a shot (I am an elder, cancer survivor, with an autoimmune disease.) Then I saw an article on my news feed about NYC Vaccine List. I went on and within a minute, I scheduled an appointment for the following day. I am so relieved that I finally had my first shot; am so grateful to NYC Vaccine list--and outraged that it takes a private volunteer to do what our state government (that's you, Mr. Cuomo) should have done weeks ago."
2021-02-09 15:13:21,"Thanks, Huge Ma.

Sadly, the states' systems (not  just in NY) were built sloppily.
Worse, no one could possibly have tested them. If they had, they would have found that the coders triaged senior citizens and the very elderly."
2021-02-09 15:13:42,Thank you to these folks for using their time and talents to help others and benefit the greater good.
2021-02-09 15:25:50,"Let's hope these innovators are already working on the real vaccination problem: namely, convincing everyone to get one.  Sure, 50% of people are in a rush to be vaccinated and smoothing out the kinks is important.  But these vaccinations are USELESS if only half get them--new variants from the unvaccinated will continue to run rampant and render the old vaccines impotent.

People who are rushing the doors at the beginning is NOT the problem.  Solve the important problem, not the temporary one:  work on convincing ALL to be vaccinated."
2021-02-09 15:30:46,This is great for NY City. How about building a site or expanding the site for those of us who do not live in the City?
2021-02-09 15:35:01,"This is an issue in Washington state as well. 
I’m shocked with the volume of software development talent here, that they haven’t stepped up to build this. Amazon provided their empty office buildings for vaccine administration. How about a simple to use tool to sign up, Jeff Bezos?"
2021-02-09 15:41:12,"This problem is true of many software systems. Good design and architecture with a few talented, motivated individuals beat large systems led project managers with little understanding of the internals. The resulting difference in cost ratio is astronomical."

2021-02-09 15:44:09,"Tech companies should make it a policy to give sabbaticals to their best software engineers and interface designers to tackle public equity and access issues, improve local governance and oversight, as well as a myriad of other important social issues by developing intelligent websites and apps to better society as a whole. The apps and websites they develop should be the ￼antithesis of big data companies by protecting privacy, spreading equitable access on all types of platforms and important factual information that every democratic citizen should have easy unfettered access to.

These intelligent young adults should embrace improvement of the digital world as new form of charity work and public service. Beyond traditional monetary
contributions to high-quality high-impact local nonprofit organizations which improve our communities, this type of public service work would benefit everyone across the digital divide. Ideas and ideals that could truly  make our country a global (digital) democratic force for good, by taking care of each other and lead by example."

Here we have an individual hero (who did an indisputably awesome thing), but there are reasons why those vaccine scheduling technologies are so bad, all having to do with decades of overwrought procurement policy, lobby-fueled vendor lock-in schemes, and a deeply-entrenched culture of stagnation and obedience, enforced by the threat of reprimand and embarrassment (not that the latter is much of a deterrent).

I believe there's an enormous wealth of talent in the public sector, but because of these rather unexciting structural reasons, it's not mobilized effectively."
2021-02-09 15:52:01,"Thank you NY Times – I am sure this exposure will help expedite vaccination. On a more political note, I see this as yet more evidence for the efficiency of free market capitalism; I would argue that if the distribution efforts were privatized from the beginning, it would have doubled the speed of inoculation (and yes, some wealthy people would have gotten the vaccine first; still, it would have been a win win, because poor people would have gotten it quicker, too)."
2021-02-09 15:58:22,"Anyone want to fix the NYS DMV website whilst they're at it???

All jokes aside; for a country that prides itself on the quality of it's tech sector, there is no excuse for having such poor public tech infrastructure. 

Gov.uk, Estonia or any European or Scandinavian countries are examples of better governement public tech infrastructure. Why can't we manage all our local, state and federal interactions online? Why can't the federal government create a squarespace/shopify type platform that each department, state and local can plug into and spin up easily? Managing payments, personal profiles, bookings and appointments are in effect all these different government organisations do - this has been solved many times over in the private sector. Why is it so hard in the public sector?"
2021-02-09 16:03:36,"Kudos to Mr. Ma for designing and implementing (for $50) what governments usually pay six-figure-minimum retainers to consulting firms to design. 

Now let's talk about why a city like NYC, a hub of the tech industry, clearly did not leverage local resources in building their own system. Tech companies have been looking for ways to contribute (or to be seen to contribute) to pandemic mitigation. I imagine Google/ Microsoft/ Salesforce/ etc, all of which have a large NYC presence, would have jumped at the opportunity to contribute to the official, city-run system, and all those companies know a thing or two about designing user-friendly systems."
2021-02-09 16:03:57,This from the state where a vociferous Cuomo complained about the lack of coordinated federal response. Now he has every county executive and city leader practically stuck with the same problem. Seems like Shrugginitis is very contagious.
2021-02-09 16:07:23,"Why can't we leverage senior centers to distribute vaccines, or at least make appointments for seniors?  My parents are in their mid-eighties, who can't speak English.  It stressed me out when they looked at me, hoping I could get them vaccinated.  But working full time, I could not spend 24 x7 on searching for appointments for them.  One day in late January, I waited for over two hours on 311 and only was told no appointments available till June.  I finally got successful last week when my friend told me she just booked for her parents.  My parents were fortunate, but what about those seniors with no kids to assist them?  The city and state should have done a better job in serving the seniors."
2021-02-09 16:10:41,"I left a comment on the Times, just yesterday I think, that this is what we need; no idea it had already been done. So wow, thanks Mr. Ma. 
However, that Mr. Ma and a few friends could do this so quickly and so cheaply is a serious indictment of New York State for not doing this 2 months ago.
Too late for me, though. After constantly scanning multiple web pages for weeks, I did find an appointment in the next county. But it should not have been so difficult."
2021-02-09 16:11:39,"It couldn't be that they are attempting to screen out too many people?  Or that they don't know how to build good websites.  Plenty of companies have no idea of how to build decent websites.  Why should governments be any better?  They build in complexity rather than eliminating information they don't need.  

I think that it's a big mistake to force us to go to computers to sign up for the vaccine.  The internet is not that quick in the United States.  Everyone does not have access to a good connection.  Libraries are closed across the country.  And the various governments are probably asking for information that is not necessary.  

It's like income taxes.  Our government doesn't want to mail us the information.  It doesn't want to put it out in print either.  So we're forced to go on line or pay someone to do our taxes for us even if our returns are a simple affair.  This is a case of the government, at every level, making our lives more expensive than necessary.  Just send us the information so we can decide what to do."
2021-02-09 16:13:48,"I really appreciate the gentleman's voluntary effort and skills. I just checked his site. It does not include the facility where I was able to get my first shot on 2/2- a friend tipped me to it- and it does not  include the site in White Plains run by Westchester County. Oh, and all the many sites listed show ""no availability"". It's 2021 people, can't we figure out how to have a global system for registration for vaccinations  N Y state?"
2021-02-09 16:16:13,"I am a senior and have senior friends.

They/I are receiving calls from every known senior org. that they are now eligible for the covid shot and should go to their computers to sign up.

The problem is that a great majority of them do not have computers or people that can help them since they are not allowed to go to any senior center because of covid or have kids living with them. 

Murphy's law in action."

2021-02-09 16:33:50,"I only wish that I had helped other people like myself, 65 and older, to get the vaccination when I was able to schedule an appointment.  I'm probably more of a minority - 65 and tech-savvy, which is why I got an early appointment.  It never occurred to me at the time."
2021-02-09 16:35:38,"We need more of this kind of heart-warming articles.
It encourages us, it mobilizes us — the ordinary citizens, to be proactive in helping others around us in this megacity. 

As I read these stories this morning, I felt subtle quivering of my heart. A rare uplifting moment after having exposed all day by checking the news often since the beginning of pandemic to all those dark ominous energies. 

Goodness and kindness are contagious, just as fears and hatreds get easily amplified in us by some crazy people with public megaphones. 
All are seeds and inklings. 

We need to be reminded now and then that we humans DO have genuine kindness in us as well. 

Love to hear more examples on how ordinary individuals reached out to the helpless and the voiceless. 
There are many many people out there who love to do some good for others."
2021-02-09 16:41:40,"In my local area (Ulster County) there is what appears to be an easy-to-use site for appointments at the two County-run vaccination sites.  I dutifully signed up and on Jan 21 received an email saying appointments were available.  By the time I logged on they were all taken.  Since then I have not received another notice, despite the ongoing program, and my regular re-registering.  A friend had the same experience.  It is clear that the program crossed us off the eligibility list, assuming that we were vaccinated.  I called the county exec's office, and was told that what I described was not possible.  Huh!  Now the governor is expanding eligibility, so seniors like myself are becoming even less likely to get our shots."
2021-02-09 16:43:53,"Another serious side effect of this lack of a centralized reservation system is that it encourages people to make multiple, or even many, appointments; which clogs the systems even further.   

I was able to get an appointment on April 27 but then added my name on the wait lists of a another system in hope of getting something sooner.   Many systems only let you join a waiting list with the ""we'll get back to you"" promise providing further incentive to join more lists.   

Because the systems are not particularly interactive, I have not figured out how I'd cancel my April appointment if I get an earlier one from another center."

2021-02-09 16:16:53,"The debacle that is the distribution of vaccines in NYS and NYC is an outrage. In my own attempts at both city and state level, only one site allowed me to make a login with password (vaccinepod.nyc.gov), which saved only a minimal amount of information. In each case, sites required the full suite of information to determine if I was eligible, along with the declarations, before telling me that there were no sites with appts available (mostly) or (the most egregious, NYC site) having me select a vaccination site, only to find that it had no appointments, and not allowing backing up to find another site. That's abominably stupid logic!

The way sites should work is:
A. Not have multiple sites, but a single site coordinating all locations giving vaccinations
B. allow login and password-protected account to be created, where all the personal info, eligibility, and declarations are handled, one time only; then
C. find out how far a person is willing to travel,
D. search for appointments within that area
E. if none found, report anticipated arrival of vaccines to various sites, query the person about good days/times, and finally
F. email or text the person providing links to sites that open appointments, or just schedule an appointment on above info tentatively, to be confirmed within a few hours of sending notification.

Why would anyone in their right mind design the distribution otherwise?"

2021-02-09 16:49:01,"The NYS Health Web site is buggy and a mess. When you check eligibility and try to proceed to the next step, the site gives you an error message to try again. I experimented using a VPN and made it to the next step of finding allocation only to see that there was no vaccine availability. Why can't they reverse these steps to first let you find a location and if there is availability, start the eligibility procedure and appointment scheduling? Poor logic. This TruVax site is very streamlined but you end up in the same place - no availability."
2021-02-09 16:51:45,"Unfortunately these ""scrapers"" cause an avalanche of excess hits on the smaller individual sites.  This is the responsibility of NYS to create the vaccine portal.  What a joke:  like they didn't see it coming?"

2021-02-09 16:58:55,"The vaccine enrollment process for the elderly has been an unmitigated disaster. 

The Federal government missed an obvious opportunity to utilize Medicare and Medicaid databases to identify the vast majority of elderly Americans and especially target those with comorbidities.  There's no reason this information couldn't have been used proactively to contact millions of people by postcard and offer an easy means to schedule a vaccine appointment -- online or by phone.  The Social Security Administration contacts every American before they turn 65 to explain their future Medicare benefits.  Why wasn't this done for tackling this pandemic among America's most vulnerable population?"
2021-02-09 17:00:46,"The technology issues covered in this article are valid and excellently presented. However, it concerns me that many articles being published, including this one, end with an emotional gush about how the grateful vaccinated individual will now be released from restricted behavior, go shopping, visit family, attend church. Nowhere does the writer mention that the vaccine is not a free pass to life as we once knew it, and that health authorities are daily repeating the mantra that we must still mask, physically distance and regulate exposure risks. The reality is, the push to vaccinate is critically important, but it’s no fairy dust. We are still learning about how this virus acts, mutates and responds in vaccinated individuals. Articles like this reinforce in the public a false notion of security. We’ve still got a ways to go."

Assembly lines are running 24 hours a day, 7 days a week with 3 shifts of employees....equipment is being strained to its absolute max because routine maintenance is being delayed over and over.

At some point it becomes necessary to acknowledge that people’s behavior can affect both their inoculation rates and their infection/survival rates.

If the federal government had done it's job when this pandemic started, and devised a national production, distribution, registration and administration system while the vaccine was being developed, this wouldn't be happening. The inequities from state to state, and within various state demographics are utterly discouraging. I'm a senior citizen who has the savvy to navigate the system, but there is no system to navigate.

We have the same problem here that finally led to the state to start the process to upgrade computer systems - the flood of applicants for unemployment payments overwhelmed the system. It isn't just because the pandemic is a once in a life time crisis, the state's everybody knew about the state's antiquated system for years. The system was just waiting for a crisis. The lack of urgency to fix infrastructure, interest in efficiency and desire to do the job right seems to be sorely lacking when I read these stories. It doesn't have to take a crisis to decide to prepare."

The vaccine registration disaster, (which is not unique to NY), highlights the ongoing incompetence.  Even worse, many so-called expert consulting firms were paid millions of dollars to solve these problems.

Even in places like NH, where vaccine registration has gone somewhat more smoothly, or people were just plain lucky, the process is unneccessarily clunky and obtuse.  (NH is scrapping the VAMS registration program, which may lead to improvement).  addtionally, much of the required information is simply data fishing - not really needed to simply schedule an appointment.

The erroneous assumption that all who need to register have internet access and are comfortable doing what many consider routine  - should have been rigorously questioned, if not tested.

Those of us who came of age in the 1960's know better than to  trust government or politicians.  So sad thatthis is again being proved true."

2021-02-09 20:20:35,"The fundamental issue here is not how ""bad"" the government website is, but how few vaccine appointments there are relative to demand. It's not that the website is failing to make appointments and vaccines being wasted since no one is signing up; rather, the demand is so high that all the appointments are immediately filled, necessitating people to spend hours on the page refreshing waiting for slots to open again. Having a phone-line for the technically illiterate wouldn't resolve this issue either.

NYC signup should be a lottery run like ND football tickets - select your eligibility tier, the dates you'd like to enter for, randomly select winners, send winners text/email/phone call / home visit (if necessary) to confirm their appt, keep picking if people say they're unavailable and keep a waitlist for no-show's. 

Anything besides pure randomness is going to be biased towards those who have the time to spend to beat the system. The goal is to design a system which can't be ""beaten"" as easily."
2021-02-09 20:21:41,"Every time I went to the sites in the NYC page they all stated that there were no appointments available. I'm 72 and decided I was going to wait for the Summer or Fall and try again. I expected that by then there would be some form of herd protection. Last Thursday. on a hunch, I tried again and to my surprise the site was alive I thought it is probably a glitch but I put all the information and was able to make an appointment for... next day, Friday at 12:45 pm it was almost empty. In and out in less than 20 minutes, ha ha now for shot #2. I It was at the Armory, Presbyterian hospital and they had just announced it was only for the residents of Upper Manhattan."

2021-02-09 21:07:09,"I'm not sure where the ""24 percent of the city's population"" number comes from.

Black people make up 27.52% of the city's population according to the Census Bureau's 2019 estimate, the latest available, which is the lowest value in 10 years. If you just look at the 65+ population -- the proper reference point against which to judge the 12% number -- it's 26.15% and has not been lower than 25.29% since 2010. 

Data here: <a href=""https://www.census.gov/data/tables/time-series/demo/popest/2010s-counties-detail.html"" target=""_blank"">https://www.census.gov/data/tables/time-series/demo/popest/2010s-counties-detail.html</a>

Big fail, whoever."
2021-02-09 22:03:36,"The vaccination system is scandalous. We are responding like a third world country. No one should have to check five, ten different websites to see if/where/when something might be available. There is no need to reinvent the wheel in terms of software that can accommodate our current needs. Airlines, for example, have systems for reservations, stand-by, etc. for each available seat. It is not a tremendous leap to expand such a system for the vaccines. It can be done for each borough. This is not rocket science.

New York will soon expand eligibility for the vaccine to those with underlying conditions, etc. That's very good, because they should be eligible. But what will this do for availability? Will those who are newly eligible displace those who have been trying to make an appointment for days or even weeks? There is no central database to show that we have already registered and have been waiting. If I was told that the next available appointment was in two months time, then I'd wait with no problem; but I want to be able to make that appointment.

I can only come to the conclusion that this lack of appointment availability is deliberate."
2021-02-09 22:11:39,"This is a global problem that should have been handled at least at the national level, with one Federal Govt-run website that should have allowed anyone to find a vaccination site and appointment based on their home zip code. Most national chains do a similar task when their web site allows you to find a business location based on your zip code. The previous administration shirked its responsibility by leaving it to the States, and the states seem to have left to counties. My friends in other NJ counties have to try web sites from different locations to find an appointment, a labor intensive task just as described in this article. 

My county, Essex, NJ, has a great site www.essexcovid.org that allows any county resident to find a place and make an appointment."

2021-02-09 22:20:10,"I’m really glad to see tech workers volunteering their time to create better solutions for these kinds of public sector challenges. But after reading this, I am left wondering if and why this is how things have to be. 

Why weren’t there enough top-notch designers, web developers, and engineers employed by the city so that it could develop a smart and accessible system on their own? The answer that comes to my mind is that local and state governments are critically underfunded and can’t afford to bring on a team of high caliber tech workers, even though that might be what they need most. 

As a result of that budgeting crisis, we see more and more stories like this that are often framed to make us feel good and hopeful about the kindness of others. But that feeling masks the much bigger issue of governments being at the mercy of tech companies to provide them with what it needs to survive in today’s time, facing today’s problems. 

TL;DR - we wouldn’t need to be praising techies for volunteering to optimize something so critical to the health and safety of our community if we were more willing to provide governments with the resources they need to create agile tech teams of their own, through things like ... taxes?"
2021-02-09 22:32:14,"That's an awesome effort, but I live in New York City, am eligible under the current categories, and just tried to use the site, and after clicking on the places where available appointments are listed for next week, I'm still taken to a screen that says there are no appointments. So, thanks for - ?"
2021-02-09 22:41:44,There are several other states where pro bono work by local experts has made the state system more user friendly.  Here a volunteer devised a text message system that was somehow able to find and publish all open vaccination appointments as the 77 county health departments posted them 24/7.  Subscribers sign up for notification when appointments become available within a selected driving radius and upon notification an appointment can then be made on the state website (if you’re quick). At least it eliminates the clunky guesswork involved in constantly opening clinic locations and blindly looking for openings.  This is a free service surviving on donations.  Kudos to all of these geniuses and shame on the vendors of the state web sites.
2021-02-09 22:42:59,"This is why I don't bother, and I'm tech-savvy.   I'm eligible, on the list, and have received four alerts now as vaccine doses became available.  I gave it a try at first, for about ten minutes, and didn't even respond to the last two.  

Trying to score an appointment is like trying to score a PS 5 was before Christmas.  (I was helping a family member.) At least then I could actually get it into my cart before the system hung, and the misery only lasted for about two minutes because the supply ran out that fast.  Our appointment system here hangs immediately and eternally the second you click on a time.  And people keep trying for hours, not knowing the appointments are already taken because the system is so overwhelmed by them they can't make it to the screen that tells them that.  Talk about an exercise in futility.  
Oh, have five or six tabs open!  Have friends and family try for you on their end (adding even more traffic to the site)!  It can take several hours but it's worth it!  Then repeat for the second dose.  Yeah, no thanks.  I'll wait.  I've made it this far."

2021-02-09 23:22:58,"It is so “third worldly” to have different web site for different vaccine sites. In Nassau County, NY, we have about 4 (may be more) county sites and 2(may be more) NY State sites. There is one website for the NYS and one each for each County site. Not only that, the various pharmacies that have the vaccine, each has different phone numbers or web sites. Not only that, no one entity informs the citizens where can they get the vaccine shot. Compared that to India (third worldly?). There is one App for the whole country. They have trained personnel going to the homes of  all elderly people to not only Download the app but to add their details including co- morbidities. The younger generation do it themselves. People then wait for getting messages to go the site xyz at ab time. They have done that with all the medical personnel including the birthing helpers in villages.

2021-02-10 00:33:58,"This article, while seemingly trying to demonstrate ingenuity, also reveals in less obvious ways, the lack of importance that people in power give to the problem of marginalization. Not caring to address this marginalization and structural inequities in their vaccination roll-out, left the most vulnerable and most affected unvaccinated and unheard. Even now, despite headlines about all the problems that continue to exist, the politicians and their wannabes will bring along some famous person to guilt people's concerns away. They have never included members of these communities in a genuine way that could have identified barriers and possible solutions to these before the fiasco became reality. So while I do applaud the efforts of most of those highlighted here, the article still makes it quite evident that even these entrepreneurs may reach only a privileged few. While they may fret about this, the larger system and its overseers have failed to show any interest in addressing or better yet, dismantling the system that bore these inequities."
2021-02-10 00:40:58,The woman who created the site fir MA lives in my town. She set up a go fund me page so she could expand and maintain her site. Lots of people have been very generous. Maybe Mr. Ma would consider this if he wants to continue his work.
2021-02-10 01:12:59,"Yes the government should get their systems up and running correctly, but let's not lose sight of why this is such a problem, there are not enough vaccines to fill the demand.  It takes time to get all the pieces in place to get a production like this going, considering there was nothing in place to start with."
2021-02-10 01:23:17,"This is unbelievable.  This in the allegedly most advanced nation on earth. We can not find a level of government that can engage these types of technology challenges with any level of competence.  We fail at the local level, the county level, the state level, the federal level. The CDC fails; our public health offices fail.  All for the lack of money we hear - until some guy throws a system together in his spare time for 50$.  
Frankly, scheduling should be run out of hospitals and private practices, not state level websites.  These institutions have direct access to the state level immunization registries which is the most important piece of this system.  Private practices all over the nation are taking huge financial hits throughout this pandemic.  I would propose that private practices receive a commission to schedule these appointments for their patients and the city and county health offices work with those who do not have their own general practitioner."

2021-02-09 21:12:10,"As an engineer, I have to say that the misery inflicted by the broken vaccination scheduling system falls squarely on the state governments, both republican and democratic. 

To figure out the right system, the Governors just need to go to a bank and stand in the teller's line for just one minute: They have ONE line for ALL their tellers. Not one line per teller !! ( for more details: read about basics of queuing theory ) 

By asking eligible folks to 'get their own appointment', they have created two levels of overall waste in the society: 
-- One by forcing each person to look at hundreds of sites to book. 
-- Two by forcing each vaccination provider to maintain their own scheduling system ( phone / website ) 

Whereas getting 95% effective vaccines in a year is a matter of national pride, the broken vaccination scheduling system is a matter of national shame. 

When we have one Google, one Facebook, one Twitter for the entire U.S.A, why can't we have one scheduling system to provide one vaccine to one nation ?? 

Mr. President Biden, please ""think outside of the box"" and get this done. Thanks."

2021-02-09 20:06:38,Too funny.  When you get a big bureaucracy (government or corporate) this is the result.  Inefficiency and incompetence.  Huge Ma and Adriena Scamparini are heroes.  I work for a big company and had to take a training on Cyber Security.  The training was supposed to take one hour.  The software was awful and then you had to get a certificate proving you took it.  I spent seven hours doing that one training that we have to take yearly.  My co workers wasted similar amounts of time. This is what well paid white collar people are doing all day as they work from home.  Everything is needlessly complex.
2021-02-09 20:04:23,A shout out to Ms. Olivia Adams from Arlington MA who developed a site while on maternity leave for Massachusetts residents.  www.macovidvaccines.com
2021-02-09 20:37:44,"So here we are America, guns or butter.  It's that simple. We have 450,000 people dead from a known lethal threat, and every day the same number of people die who died on 9/11.  

Facing this situation, our Congress, in collusion with the Military-Industrial-Political-Complex, took $730 billion per year of our tax dollars and built the greatest warfare machine on the planet that will allow us to send missiles and drop GPS-guided bombs on a picnic table in Afghanistan.  Over there, a few bad guys are mostly talking about what they see as the ""evils of America,"" but how much money have spent to put in place infrastructure to prepare for the awful COVID reality that we knew was coming?   Nickels and Dimes.  Nickles and dimes.

This must be some type of mental or spiritual disease. I mean, what type of parent, when their children are starving and hungry, uses their paycheck to buy guns."
2021-02-09 22:05:19,"So, why hasn’t the DPA been used to unleash the massive intellectual and manufacturing capabilities of this country?

Biden promised a “maximum effort.” Until he invokes the DPA, we aren’t even out of first gear.

It’s been a year - and we still don’t have a way to put N95 masks in the hands of every citizen!

Where are we? 50 states, and at least 50 ways of getting a vaccine out. In many states, it’s far worse: each county is doing its own thing! Vaccine doses have been wasted, lost, tossed, mis-applied. We could not do worse if we tried...

Roll out the universities; roll out the military. Put a real plan in place for once.

When the world said they envied our ability to handle a pandemic, our vast capacity was what they had in mind. Let’s finally take COVID-19 seriously!"
2021-02-09 18:55:16,Thanks you thank you thank you volunteers!  It's amazing that web is the primary and often the only way to serve a population that is least likely to have access to web.  Shameful lack of brain power in the USA's vaccine rollout saga.
2021-02-09 19:32:03,"The sheer incompetence of local government is stunning to behold. Here is Massachusetts we also suffer from the same affliction; a local woman built a web site that replaces the Mass.Gov website that crashed and was unusable. (Charlie Baker seems to be as untouchable as Gov. Cuomo on this). The states literally had months to develop, implement and test a web site. I said for months that we have MIT and Harvard undergrads that could do this in a weekend. I should know I am a software developer. It's breathtaking that public health admins were so incompetent. In any private industry those managers would all be fired on the spot."

2021-02-10 02:13:53,"You should see the 300 or more web sites that people in Texas are supposed to go to for finding a vaccine.  Not organized by anything regionally.  Or any logic at all.  It looks like a late 80s spreadsheet with bad links.  If you can find your city then you toggle to hopefully click on a link for that location .  You can fit France inside Texas- Mr. Hotwheels Gunsmoke Greg Abbott just gave his state of the state and didn't even mention the virus or vaccines.   Guns,  Vaginas and immigrants his only priorities- he called emergencies.   Please please someone help create a version of this idea for all 50 states.  $2,500 plus smart caring people?

2021-02-10 03:05:27,This is great but it doesn’t help when there are literally zero appointments available. We need more vaccine.
2021-02-10 02:59:04,"You have to become totally proactive on the web, clicking hundreds of times, and ignoring error messages that are invarably wrong. I'm in Virginia, and the ""disproportinate"" aspect I see is between people who are entirely proactive and those who believe that they'll wait for another day. The proactive ones get appointments eventually, clicking hundreds of times, at different times of day. It's horrible, but otherwise you'll still be 66 years old and have no vaccination in April or May. It's just the way it is. I suspect your article is ignoring this aspect."
2021-02-10 03:10:58,"The shifting of almost all interactions with businesses, healthcare, banks, pharmacies etc. to online portals is a form of elder abuse and abuse to many of us who just aren’t that tech savvy.  I spent a week trying to get my mother a vaccine appointment in Connecticut and only when my 23 year old helped we were able to do it.  The New York State enrollment is a terrible joke as well."

2021-02-10 03:42:14,"Back in my country, the Departament of Health calls/texts & emails people in those groups who are elegible -as now, people over 55, health and emergency workers, teachers and some essential workers -to schedule an appointment. Vaccination distribution is rolling out at a similar pace than in the US -same number of vaccines I suppose because it comes from the same 3-4 companies-but at least you don’t have to deal with the websites crazies; you just wait for your turn. After all, governments already have all our information."
2021-02-10 04:18:38,"Maryland needs this, too. There are multiple websites with pre-registration forms, but to actually schedule an appointment, you have to be online the minute new spots open up. (It’s like trying to get tickets to a rock concert - “sold out” in minutes). The heavy emphasis on web-based access is not very accessible for many seniors. I will keep trying to get my 89-yo parent the vaccine. So far, no luck."
2021-02-10 04:55:37,"This is so disappointing. As a democrat I believe there is a valuable place for government in our society but when I see how ineffective this vaccine appointment system is or when I want to email my local city hall and they instruct me to fax them instead, I hold my head in despair."

2021-02-09 15:14:43,"I'm a web/app designer who's worked on these type of mass scale projects. A reason why this happens is the people in charge will spend 80-85% of the time debating it across multiple committees, and then make up for it by rushing the implementation process with the lowest bidder. 

Also given the dire need of the situation and lack of federal guidance, I'm pretty sure the mandate was ""We need something now"" and we'll fix it later.

You can make this situation work as long as you have a clear vision guided by experienced people who understand the tech and politics of it all, I'm guessing there aren't that many people in state government."

2021-02-09 15:06:18,"NYS had one year to prepare to administer vaccines. Vaccines may be the most effectual response to the pandemic. Of course Gov. Cuomo has done a lot, but his failure to create one reservation system instead of allowing perhaps thousands and a free-for-all, requires an explanation from him, and indeed, a public aceptance of responsibility."
2021-02-09 15:02:28,"We have the same problem here in Oregon, home to Intel’s largest site and the “Silicon Forest”.  The state opened 20,000 slots for people over 80, but the scheduling system(?) only allowed 5,500 to get appointments.  Now those seniors will have to compete with thousands more when the state opens vaccines to people 75 .  In a world with Amazon and Google, how does this happen?  It’s shameful."
2021-02-09 18:58:44,"A couple of points.  There are a bunch of tech people who would have been champing at the bit to help.  There is a huge open source software community that could have helped.  Amazon has a govenment version of their cloud that they probably would have donated help and compute resources for this. Two, why are we asking people to fight over appointments.  Why not allow people to sign up for a waiting list and distribute the appointments equitably? This is not rocket science and it is hard to see how leaving states and cities to fend for themselves to create appointment systems was a good idea."
2021-02-09 18:22:02,At some point people will realize that competent government is worth the price.
2021-02-10 10:36:15,"The irony of making a system that is meant to help the elderly with technological challenges go right to twitter to notify who? (hint: not the elderly). Maybe it will pickup a few people booking for their elders...

Why not just impose booking windows, eg. Booking 48 hours out or longer can only be done for those over a certain age. Within 48 hours it opens to anyone.

Love the initiative by the volunteers and glad to see people helping out."

Governments only make bad websites and I do mean ONLY"
2021-02-10 11:18:26,"I checked out the independent vaccine sites mentioned here. They're vastly better than the official ones, but they still require quick reflexes. So unless you have someone younger in your household to pounce on the appointments when they come up, you're out of luck. This whole process is so exhausting and humiliating for older people. Having huge vaccination centers makes sense in a general way, but how are frail people going to be able to get to and negotiate these huge, impersonal spaces? Even if they do, miraculously, manage to get an appointment?"
2021-02-10 12:29:01,"No one in charge seems to have any understanding of logistics and computer programming. A team focused on THIS could solve the problem straightaway... right now we have doctors, public health scientists, insurance administrators, investment analysts, legislators.... all on ""task forces"" in Pennsylvania.

Not one who has the skills to solve this. Even with a vaccine shortage, a system that worked, and WAITING to go into effect as the shortage eased, would go a long way to inspiring confidence that we will all get the vaccine."
2021-02-10 12:41:07,"Maybe the messy and impenetrable rollout of yet another website should teach the government a lesson, one that should have been learned with the terrible start of Obamacare. If a mission is important- like public health- it is way past time to be paying enough human workers to get the job done. Scrimping on staffing leads to the mess we are in now. 
Computer systems, at least at the current level of sophistication, do nothing to replace human help."
2021-02-10 12:32:01,"The built-in ridiculousness of the NYS and NYC websites is apparent to anyone who tries to use them. Every time the NYS website is used you have to enter all your information (name, address, DOB, reason you're qualified, etc.). That should not happen. And on the NYC website, even though the vaccine is FREE and there should be NO CHARGE for its administration, NYC requests insurance information, that, along with name, address, DOB and reason for vaccination have to be entered EVERY SINGLE TIME. No insurance? No vaccine - because you can't get past that page. 

Waste of money and of my precious time."
2021-02-10 13:01:09,"I am 79, overweight and on an immune suppressing drug and have not been successful still in getting an appointment for the vaccine.  I live in the Mid Hudson valley which is the second highest area in NY State for Covid. All the sites I know of say there is nothing available or indicate drug stores that when called do not have the vaccine. It is a frustrating and exhausting undertaking. 
There must be young tech savvy folks outside the city who care enough to help older folks like me."
2021-02-10 13:02:51,Maybe he could design one for the state of New Jersey too! I’ve been trying to make an appointment for my elderly mother there and it’s chaos.
2021-02-10 13:11:37,"Here in New Hampshire, the VAMS system is a joke.  Appointments for 1b group members exceed 2 hours for 211 assistance, and the VAMS website lists appointments a month or more beyond actual open dates.  

The only bright light in this mess is the actual injection sites, manned by hospital, fire and EMS volunteers, as well as the local military.  These folks are to be commended - too bad they aren't supported by a competent sign-up process.  

Hoping that the state government will work on improvements has so far been a futile effort.  Pols from both sides of the aisle have resorted to political finger-pointing instead of concerted efforts to actually, you know, fix the problem...."

2021-02-10 15:01:29,"This problem is nationwide. I finally grabbed a local health department appointment after being closed out of that service, the local hospital, a large medical group, and Walgreens. Each time after having to go through a cumbersome registration process that was not mobile-friendly, yet the availability alerts came as text messages. In the 5 minutes it took to make the appointment (answering a series of clinically irrelevant demographic questions) the site closed, so I could not make an appointment for my wife. This was roughly 300 appointments taken in 5 minutes in a county with a total population of 250,000. The free for all is insane. Health care workers should get their vaccines at work unless working in a very small practice.  It would be simpler and more fair if everyone above age 65 could register (does not have to be in one central site) and the appointments be given out in age order. We who are just above 65 will understand if an 80 year old goes ahead of us. It took 6 months and registration at 3 pharmacy chains to get the 2 part shingles vaccine last year. But one of those pharmacies called us when the vaccine came in. Still waiting for calls from the others although now there is so much supply that it is being advertised on TV. It will probably be the same with Covid later this year."
2021-02-10 16:06:22,It's fantastic that Mr Ma had the skills and the impetus to do this privately. It just seems inconceivable that he had to. The fact that our government couldn't figure out that this was needed or how to get it done is very revealing of our technical position in the world. We have fallen so far behind. We can't afford four more years like the last.
2021-02-10 17:55:35,"I wrote to the mayor offering to build a website to centralize the city's search for vaccines. I had in mind something a bit more ambitious than Huge Ma's which is a step in the right direction. I got no response. 

Then I read that Cuomo does not want to centralize the distribution of vaccines - but wants them handled independently by each distributor. What a mess. I realized politics was coopting the right way to do this. 

Good for Huge Ma for plunging into that mess and bringing some order to it."
2021-02-10 18:03:01,Elders' neglect is the proper definition.  The problem is that there is not a central list that should be used when appointments are available based on priority and people can put their names in several places knowing how to use the internet. The Government is failing once again in taking care of the elders. And now will get worse when more younger people will be able to get the vaccine. They believe that the elder has no power in election time.

2021-02-10 14:24:53,"I need to share with you. It is giving me anxiety to spend weeks and weeks without being able to get vaccinated even being in the priority groups. I feel like Governor Cuomo and the Mayor are lying to us. I update the scheduling page all day long and nothing, never opens a vacancy. This has given me despair, because in black people we are left out. Cade the Brooklyn locations to vaccinate black people just like they did in the Bronx. I don't know who to appeal to anymore, I feel abandoned even more as an immigrant. For that much questionnaire, it's just a vaccine. I don't feel transparent in the vaccination process. How to vaccinate 70% of white people in a city that the black and Latin population were and are being decimated by Covid. It is a way to kill us, if we do not die from Covid we will die of anxiety to pass this torture. I no longer know who to ask for help. They should open locations for blacks and Latinos regardless of neighborhoods, as they are unable to deliver vaccines in a more equitable and equitable manner."

Meanwhile, Biden and the Democrats are promoting a $15 minimum wage and other initiatives that will discourage small businesses from hiring.  My guess is that work force participation will barely increase  during the Biden administration despite reopening the economy once the Covid pandemic is under control."
2021-02-09 14:53:45,I understand that lawmakers are engaged in the early brainstorming stage of these policy discussions.   I agree with public policy that provides unencumbered cash support for individuals and families to lift them out of poverty.  I am having a problem with providing this same support for individuals and families that have income well above the poverty level; in the neighborhood of $150k / year.   These are good policy discussions and I am becoming optimistic about our future again.
2021-02-09 14:56:38,This is beyond frustrating. I understand that there are many families in need but I fail to understand how directly tying government compensation based on the number of children is the answer. This is essentially an incentive for the poor to have more children at the tax payers' expense. I'd prefer to see this money instead spent on job programs or infrastructure projects that provide meaningful skills and the chance for career growth. This only perpetuates a cycle that encourages complacency and thoughtless breeding.
2021-02-09 15:19:56,"I am against giving money to people because they have kids. I am for providing better teachers, education and meal ( all 3 if need be) at school but not to hand cash to people that clearly don't know how to manage it. One of the things I think is scarier than poverty is over population and where we are headed. Kids should not suffer but I am against this program."

2021-02-09 15:41:12,"This should be part of a larger discussion on the balance between familial responsibility and government responsibility for raising children.  Do we expect the missing parents in single parent homes to bear part of the financial burden for their children?  Should working parents be so heavily taxed to pay for other people’s decisions. Under current taxes, two income families pay a disproportionate share by becoming ineligible for health insurance subsidies, tax credits, housing subsidies, food stamps, and in New York State, their children are ineligible  for free state college tuition.   Articles such as this should include detailed information on the cost/value of all available benefits to the proposed recipients and the costs to working families."
2021-02-09 15:48:37,"I would really like to see a more coordinated pushback against this idea that more generous tax credits or benefits or whatever for low income families would be a ""disincentive to work."" The idea that giving an already poor family, barely able to make ends meet, a few extra thousand dollars a year to help buy food, pay bills, meet expenses, etc. would be enough to make those receiving the benefits quit their jobs and kick up their feet laughable at best."
2021-02-09 15:52:30,"To those commenting that these payments will encourage people to have more children, really? This is a myth of the old welfare queen argument that is rooted in patriarchal and racist thought patterns. 

My husband and I earn $80K annually combined and still struggle to make ends meet, having very little left to save or deal with emergencies. Part time childcare for our two young children is around $1000/month, and it is necessary for us to have so that both of us can work. 

Added to the financial struggles for our family of 4, is the distance learning for the older of our two children. We are in a never ending battle of exhaustion from the juggling act balancing our full time work schedule, distance learning, and parenting. Tax funded infrastructure does not fix  all of this for us. We would welcome federal assistance in the form of direct payments like to just give us some breathing room."
2021-02-09 16:11:55,"I am fine trying out pilot programs like these to see what works in the real world.  But at some point we have to stop just treating symptoms and address the underlying cause: too many people having children they cannot afford to take care of.  The government will never be able to fully fix the situation when people who can barely support themselves have a bunch of kids.  That is the root cause for so much suffering, inequality, crime and dysfunction in our country and throughout the world."

Wouldn't it be better to create jobs, especially for infrastructure repair and renewable energy generation, than to give people a direct handout?  We have thrown money at poverty for 60 years and except for the decrease from 19% to mid teens in the late 1960s we have done little to decrease the poverty rate.  Better education and jobs, as well as discouraging elective single parenthood, is much more likely to be successful."
2021-02-09 16:43:38,"The top 1% in the USA have a higher living standard than they would in Canada, the next 10% somewhat higher but for the bottom 20% it is dire due to higher welfare, unemployment, pension and child benefits in Canada plus the effects of the awful health care system for the poor in the USA. Unemployment levels are usually similar when allowance is made that Canada includes those who have not looked for work in the totals. I notice again the allegation that a gradual increase to 15 dollars in the minimum wage will lead to the loss of 1.5 million jobs. Minimum wages have moved rapidly up towards this level across Canada for all employment with no evidence of significant job losses. i would suggest the argument has racial undertones in the USA."
2021-02-09 17:20:11,"If they really want to help children and parents, develop a program for childcare assistance/credits for everyone. Childcare is our highest expense and the only way to lower that expense would be to quit my job, but I am the higher earning parent and we cannot survive on a single income. The minimum wage is increasing in my state on May 1st and our childcare costs are almost doubling per week because of it. If parents could have affordable childcare, they could hold higher paying jobs."
2021-02-09 17:29:23,"“At the very least, policies shouldn’t create disincentives to work, produce long-term economic consequences, nor enable dependency on the benefit,...”  Hmm, and what do they think they are doing when they give all those tax breaks to the wealthiest people and corporations?  The long term consequences of that are obvious:  increased user fees, cuts in social safety net programs, a failing infrastructure, and greater income inequality.

What does the GOP have against helping families?  And why on earth does business continue to support a party that is so clearly against helping citizens who are employees?  Does business believe that not paying taxes helps America to be competitive when it comes to productivity?  Does the GOP think that it's fair to subsidize the wealthiest while starving the rest of us to the point where we cannot possibly help ourselves any longer?  

Nearly everything the GOP does is designed to help their richest donors.  This is not public service.  It's using government to further an agenda that deliberately shortchanges most of the public.  How many people need to die or forgo medical care before the GOP understands that other countries consider it a basic right?  How many people need to starve for the same reason.  How many more homeless people will it take before they notice the problems facing working people?  

I'd prefer to pay more in taxes and get something other than a bloviating GOP for it.  A decent life would be a fair trade."
2021-02-09 17:44:57,"The long term solution is free or very low cost child care.  That would greatly lower the child poverty rate without creating a disincentive to work.  Kids get fed and educated, parents get to earn money, observant teachers help address social problems in the child's home , kids grow up happy and productive.  I believe that's the difference between the United States and other developed countries in Europe.  I'm not a fan of either the Biden or Romney plan because they do not direct the money where it is needed and would help the most. 
 Sorry, but some families will use the money on lottery tickets and cheap vodka, not the kids.  If our leaders would simply invite a group of say 50 low income moms, day care providers and social workers - no one above low level supervisor! -  to brainstorm a solution instead of a bunch of well to do politicians with very little incite into the problem other than the empathy to do something about child poverty (and that is worth a lot), they could solve child poverty.  It doesn't take a Harvard education."

First, the Democrats must stop using this pandemic as an opportunity to address what they perceive is necessary to achieve equity or equality (they are different, but Dems seem to believe in the former).  This is not time for wealth redistribution, open borders, aid to families that may or may not need it.

Secondly, we've already tried this 'experiment' with aid to dependent children.  It produced not humanitarian aid for kids while mom got back on her feet, but instead produced a baby birthing career for too many; they get more money per month per child, but no guarantees where that money goes and no incentive to stop having babies they can't afford.  I don't blame these young women.  I blame Congress.

With those as givens, they are more likely to have enjoyable and productive lives.

It may cost a bit up front to get it moving, but eventually remedial expenses will decrease as our kids flourish.  In fact, I read somewhere that for every $ spent on children, the return is about $5.  Pretty nice rate of return, if my memory is right.  We could test it out."

That's down to Pfizer, not the EU or solidarity particularly. We can judge the EU on their roll-out when they get supplies.

Pfizer has separate US production facilities, so it doesn't affect us.

2021-02-08 21:26:48,"The mentality here is completely backwards.  The hard fact is that the EU began negotiating with drug companies, and funding vaccine development, much later and in a much smaller amount than the US and UK.  That is the essence of the difference.  Germany acting on its own would not just have had quicker vaccination because they were ""stealing"" doses from Slovenia or Spain, but because they would have been able to provide the funds and resources to vaccine developers that the US and UK provided.  

Frankly, the EU has failed in their vaccine effort, and there is a concerted effort to hide this failure in the banner of solidarity rather than an explanation of why Europe, through the EU, played such a tiny role in the discovery of, and production expansion for , the vaccines that are the only possible solution to the pandemic.  To give one example: Sanofi (French) has just signed a contract to help produce the Pfizer/BioNTech (American/German) vaccine, and will be ready to do so by summer.  Why was this not deal not made in June, so that the factory would already be producing vaccine?  You are deluded if you think the answer is anything other than ""France wanted Sanofi to produce a 'French' vaccine, Germany wanted BioNTech to produce a 'German' vaccine, and the EU was unable to coordinate even when BioNTech entered Stage 3 trials"".  

(I will also say that is very odd that this article, in the hard news section, takes the EU's PR position as a fact...)"
2021-02-08 21:28:42,"Vaccine Nationalism has become closely linked to Brexit.  Today a British minister became a salesman for 'The Oxford Vaccine' noting that there was *no evidence* the poorly-tested Great British product would lead to death - because *there is simply no data on its effectiveness in over-65s or against new variants* - implying lack of evidence was evidence against something.

This seems to typify the fast but clumsy rollout of 'The Brexit Vaccine'.

Eric Topol, director of the Scripps Research Translational Institute, part of a Californian hub for biosciences, said AstraZeneca’s data stood out for the wrong reasons. “It was this hodgepodge, throwing all these different trials together and low dose, a standard dose, a dose by accident. I mean, you just can’t make this stuff up.”

Astrazeneca said in December they would provide part of their British vaccine supply from European production before border controls came in on 1 Jan.  A suspicion voiced by EU politicians (suddenly told by AstraZeneca that EU supply would be cut to 25%, but supply to their host country maintained at 100%) that vaccine was being routed from EU to UK via the unchecked Irish border after 1 Jan, led to flagwaving xenophobic outrage in Britain, as AstraZeneca, often criticized for lack of transparency in the past, ambiguously insisted simply that the UK was fully served by their 'British supply chain' (but from where?).

The clumsy British vaccine success story may be a bit premature."

Simple - the UK put everything behind the AZ vaccine, way before anyone else, including the build of factories (which it is still doing) behind the UK came the USA, not much to choose. Ah then along came the EU, after AZ had signed a massive third world deal with India. 
Then the EU couldn't approve a vaccine, so, thats's the fault of the UK? 
One thing the UK is best at is flexibility, redirection, focussing resources.
Try that across the EU."
2021-02-08 21:35:28,"Many European commenters manage to defy logic and reason to justify the impossibly difficult position that the EU is doing as good a job of immunisation as could be expected and that the AZ vaccine, which is a more significant driver of the UK's vaccination programme than the EU's is somehow inferior to other vaccine types. Forget ""vaccine nationalism"" this is unedifying chauvinism.

Beyond this unseemly squabble, however, the administrative incompetence and political maladroitness that vdL displayed in activating and then rescinding the emergency suspension of the Northern Ireland Protocol should be a cause for concern across all EU capitals. 

The evidence has been stacking up:
1) German leaks of misleading information to Handelsblatt about the AZ vaccine
2) The EU's suggestion that AZ ""must be"" lying about the manufacturing delays in its EU-based plants
3) The late-night suspendion of critical parts of the ""Northern Ireland Protocol"" without consultation or prior notice (even to Ireland!)
4) The French President's suggestions that the AZ vaccine was less effective than other vaccine types.

Brexit was exhausting. No doubt it will continue to be wearying.

This is an example of how narratives get set one way or the other. Also, regarding the hotline trouble in one part of Germany, this is a federal state, and each Land does things its own way.

I think this is just one more example of how people believe they can throw money at any problem.  Unfortunately it doesn't seem like viruses play by those rules.  I live in France and I'm grateful to live somewhere with a comprehensive pandemic plan.  The hospitals are intact, my kids are in school and there is a government safety net for those who need it.

In Spain, the national agency has only approved it for people between 18 and 55. The article seems to criticize AstraZeneca but the fact is its vaccine has not obtained the same level of approval in the EU as it has in Britain. Why do we have an EU agency if the national agencies do not accept its decisions?

In the UK the public sector (NHS, local councils), private sector (including large pharmacy retail chains such as Boots and Super Drug who have handled much of the warehousing and distribution of the vaccines) and the voluntary sector have been working hand in hand. Vaccines have been given by GPs, nurses, pharmacists both current and retired and St John's Ambulance volunteers.

But the net result of more information is not more or better action.    We can hardly accomplish the fundamentals of vaccination and public health precautions.

I suppose it's good to know when vaccines fail in a given area it's because the virus variant in that area is different than it used to be.

The pandemic has been infecting people and causing deaths for over a year, yet we have only had sporadic, partial, and largely ineffective travel restrictions. Restricting travel, both to and within the country, should have been one of the first lines of defense.

Trump was proud of trumpeting his restriction on travel from China as evidence of his effectiveness in combating the pandemic (ignoring his failure to use or encourage other critical methods), yet hundreds of thousands came into the country from China while the restrictions were in place. And he did not restrict travel from other countries. 

“suggesting that the risk of dying of B.1.1.7 is 35 percent higher than it is for other variants.” 

The risk of mutations was known from the start, yet did not seem to be of concern to Trump who let the pandemic swell, increasing the likelihood of more serious mutations.

“Already in Britain, researchers have found samples of B.1.1.7 that have gained a new mutation with the potential to make vaccines less effective. It’s not clear whether these viruses will become common.”

2021-02-10 23:02:43,"Since we weren't testing for this variant and  the US Covid new case curve matches UK's day for day, how do we know that the recent surge in the US was not caused by this variant or some other analogue with the N501Y mutation.    This explanation fits the Occam's razor criteria for what we've been seeing, and is similar to the rise and fall of the D614G mutation, which was not actually understood until months later."

After almost a year of sheltering at home with curbside pickup, walks in deserted parks and driveway waves, the vaccines up gave me such hope but now I’m despondent. At 64 I’m waiting for my turn to sign up for the vaccine but I have to ask what’s the point if the variants are able to outsmart the current vaccines?  Why should we get the vaccine? Does it still protect from serious illness? No one seems willing to answer that. Should I wait until vaccines are tweaked? Sad..."

2021-02-10 22:58:53,"The virus variant is spreading rapidly in the US and what are governors across the country doing, throwing open the states so more will get sick and die.

What arrogance and ignorance."
2021-02-11 01:54:20,"Took a walk today in NYC and spas, gyms, and restaurants and all open or preparing to open in a few days. Great timing, Cuomo. Who is advising you?"
