2020-02-11 12:28,Wouldn’t it be more intelligent to check if she’d traveled to China recently rather than decline her Chinese passport? Would  they potentially allow an American passport holder  on board without checking if he or she  had recently visited China?
2020-02-11 12:25,"“two people living on different floors were found to be infected with the coronavirus

The two cases appeared to suggest that the virus had spread through the building, perhaps through a pipe”

Sounds ridiculous. Why not through simple touching of the elevator buttons?"
2020-02-11 12:32,Please explain the pipe hypothesis a little more clearly. I'm left almost with visions of Magritte .

2020-02-11 13:09,This is going to put a bigger short term dent in globalism than Steve Bannon.
2020-02-11 13:04,The number of worldwide cases and deaths are not being accurately and consistently reported.  Compare numbers given at various sites.  Where is accurate information available?
2020-02-11 13:25,"The Times and the news media in general should remind us in each story about the virus of how it’s severity affects those with compromised immune systems more than others. 
A comparison with other current and past flu outbreaks would be helpful each time too. 
It is scary, but let’s limit the panic."
2020-02-11 13:09,"Looks like your graphic needs to be updated?  In the last week,   what has been learned about how contagious the Novel coronavirus may be (human-to-human transmission, possible transmission through air vents and pipes) means it is more transmissible and thus more contagious than this graphic shows.  And, is it more deadly than depicted in this early assessment?"
2020-02-11 13:26,This is the first time I can say I support Trump as the Times attempts to ridicule him as a germaphobe. This animal-borne virus is clearly very contagious and I support all precautions and frankly the picture of US evacuees getting off a plane into a bus without hazmat suits on worries me. They are all more than likely candidates for the virus and should be treated as imminent sources of such especially now that new information suggests transmission is other than extremely close quarters. Go get that virus Trump bc your instincts appear to be dead-on correct.
2020-02-11 12:53,"I'm guessing you can get a real cheap cruise right now.

while I see the concern about this virus ; folks wash your hands ALOT and don't don't touch your face at all---dont touch doorknobs use a paper towel etc

how does this compare to the flu? Is it worse somehow? 
I don't see these drastic measures for the flu and I think its just as 

deadly?? I don't know."
2020-02-11 12:46,"Hard to grasp that people are still getting on cruise ships, even fighting for their right to board a cruise ship."
2020-02-11 13:26,"Serious unanswered question: How dangerous is this disease to well-nourished, otherwise healthy persons exposed:
*Means of exposure (food, air, physical contact or other vectors - which vectors actually transmit the virus?)
*Population: are males/females equally vulnerable? Any sign of genetics of a given population making it more/less vulnerable?
*Do existing anti-virals, either given post-infection or as prophylactic seem to be effective? If so, which ones and dosed how/when?
*Aside from “high fever”, by what mechanism does this virus kill. Which systems are affected?
Sorry, but I don’t think I’ve seen these kinds of questions addressed by any media. There’s lots of panic, but, aside from suggestions we avoid sites where there have been outbreaks, contaminated food or individuals exposed themselves, there’s been little information.
Real data reminds me of the nonsense guesswork from allegedly informed sources during the early days of AIDS (at first, amyl nitrate, a recreational inhaled drug popular in the gay community was blamed), or total ignorance being pedaled as fact - the “demon” theory that encouraged mass cat slaughters during the Plague outbreak of the mid-1300s, an act that helped the disease spread when flea-carrying rats were left unchecked.
Please publish a story on the actual disease beyond photos of the virus."
2020-02-11 13:47,"Scientists have suspected that 2019-nCoV can be spread through the air similar to influenza given the rapid rate of confirmed cases. It is also suspected that infected people can spread the virus before showing any symptoms, as well as for some unknown time after they are asymptomatic, though presumably that is only a few days.

So the folks at that mall back in January, they've been spreading the virus already if they've gotten it.

A lot of the measures being taken, such as spraying a disinfectant, seem aimed at easing public fears rather than there being any evidence of their effectiveness."
2020-02-11 14:16,"Profiling someone may be inappropriate as cause for an officer of the law to pull over someone over in a traffic stop.    It's unfair to assume someone is criminal because of their appearance.

Suspicion or fear of carrying a communicable infection is not the same thing as thinking someone is up to no good.   You can't blame someone for carrying a virus.  However, sorry to say, there is no equal protection clause or civil rights to a virus or the person carrying it.   Quarantine is a form of martial law in a time of public health emergency, which is where we are. Political correctness may not apply with the same obvious logic in matters of any new virus, no matter the source or the carrier.    Admonitions against fear itself, fear of the other, fear without reason don't work when there is a new virus.

So what is a fair and brave and balanced reaction to this situation?    

I won't be on a cruise or carousing in Canton, but what happens when the outbreak reaches home?"
2020-02-11 14:02,"Why is no one talking about the real culprit in the Coronavirus pandemic, the Chinese governments total lack of safe food regulations. We get concerned when there is a small failure in our food inspections and a few people fall ill before recall. They allow the sale of live animals for food. If Trump wants to build walls maybe he should start by protecting us against inadequate FDA regulations."
2020-02-11 14:03,"Square bracket request. [Xenophobia] is different than racism. 

Xenophobia is a dislike of or prejudice against people from other countries. 

Racism is prejudice, discrimination, or antagonism directed against someone of a different race based on the belief that one's own race is superior."
2020-02-11 14:28,By far the Guardian has given more continuous news and advice about this virus and its consequences than any newspaper or news outlet in the United States. Shame on you for covering in such detail the tiniest news items about the self serving rages of Trump's synchophants when such a tragic health crisis is not. Just because it is in a seemingly distant location is no excuse when we are in a global economy.
2020-02-11 14:27,"US citizen patient cleared by CDC after testing negative is released from San Diego hospital.  US citizen patient urgently readmitted to San Diego hospital after CDC admits error in testing. Patient DOES have coronavirus.

Oops!!!

What was that about China's 'arrogant' Public Health bosses refusing to accept 'help' from CDC? I'm sure they're glad the WHO has now arrived."
2020-02-11 13:37,"“...Infections in a Hong Kong building raise fears about how the virus spreads....”
You just need one of the building habitants and his family, who could be infected without knowing, to touch the door handles or elevator buttons and then all others habitants  that touch the handles will get it.
Now we are imagining that the virus has wings and flies trough venting systems!!. It could be true, like legionella, but there are also easier explanations. 
Same way you will catch the flu if YOU DONT WASH YOUR HANDS
After a few days of traveling inside the USA and watching how we behave in public, I think that if people is not re educated on how to wash their hands, avoid buffet style dinners and practice simple infection control etiquette, this infections may not be that easy to handle"
2020-02-11 13:48,"Pipes?  Does the article mean sanitary vents, sanitary lines, kitchen and bath exhausts, or heating and air conditioning ducts? Don't panic people with a generic word like ""pipes""."
2020-02-11 14:29,Why would they come to the conclusion that the virus is spreading through piping in an apartment building when the logical explanation is that it’s probably being transmitted by the front door of the building ?
2020-02-11 14:55,"It’s WATERBORNE?  Heaven help us.

This may explain why the Japanese government doesn’t want to let people off that cruise ship (that has a self-contained plumbing and waste processing system)."
2020-02-11 15:07,"Why do otherwise scientifically educated governments still rely on the whims of scientifically ignorant leaders like Xi and Trump to decide how to fight epidemic viruses like this coronavirus. Respiratory viruses are undoubtedly spread from person to person by either direct person to person contact, or aerosol spray when someone coughs or sneezes spraying droplets through the air to those within a small area near the infected person, and through FOMITES. If an infected person touches a coin or an elevator button or a handrail or anything else he can leave behind infectious virions which can be picked up by the next person to touch that fomite. Face masks may reduce the chance of spreading viruses by aerosol spray, but most infections are probably acquired by touching contaminated ""Fomites"" like money or door handles or anything else. Handwashing is probably more important than anything else. We must assume everywhere our hand touches in the public domain is contaminated with corona-virus. Spraying disinfectant around is about as effective as the incense used to keep away the black plague in the Middle Ages. The minute you walk into your home you need to wash your hands before touching any object or surface and above all never touch your face, eyes, nose, mouth before washing thoroughly with soap. Now, what do we do about the objects we buy and bring home which may have been placed on the store shelves by human hands which have not been washed."
2020-02-11 15:01,I wish the Times could get more information from Chinese Health Specialists. We are still very much in the dark with regards to transmission of the virus. We should also have some information of how leaky the quarantine measures are in terms of implementation. Is the virus spreading in spite of effective quarantine measures or is it quarantine in name only? I saw video of people being forcibly dragged out of their homes to be quarantined. That almost never works.
2020-02-11 15:10,"Traveled to the Grand Canyon, Zion National Park and Vegas the last week of January. I observed hundreds of mainland China tourists at these locations before the airport screening kicked-in. There are many ways this virus can leave China."
2020-02-11 15:13,Stock up on water and canned foods.
2020-02-11 15:37,"Science is going to have to get us out of this one.  The numbers of infected seem to be going up not down.  It’s only a matter of time before there is an outbreak here and although we may be more prepared in theory, our constitution doesn’t really conform to the idea of whole cities being shut down or forced long term isolation.  The communists are much better at that."
2020-02-11 15:25,"Since some viruses are known to survive on airplane seat arms or tray tables, is it possible that this is also true of the corona-virus?

If so, is it also possible that the corona-virus could survive for some time on clothing or other personal objects imported from China?"
2020-02-11 15:29,"Reading about all the unknowns of this virus is very concerning. After reading the article about President Trump as a germaphobe, quite frankly, I am glad he is. I think he can relate to a significant many of us that sit on the side of prudence. Money or possibly your life, you decide which you see is most valuable for a possible endemic."
2020-02-11 12:38,"I’m no epidemiologist, but it doesn’t look to me like this virus is under any control. Quarantining and sealing off buildings can only do so much, but in the end it will still get out of the bag. The main objective must surely be to buy time and produce a vaccine of some sorts, as quickly as possible, because it’s more a question of when rather than if this becomes a pandemic."
2020-02-11 13:43,"""Hong Kong officials have put into quarantine dozens of residents of one apartment building after two people who live on different floors of the building were found to be infected with the coronavirus, the authorities said on Tuesday.

The two cases appeared to suggest that the virus had spread through the building, perhaps through a pipe, raising new fears about how the virus spreads.""

Why does this suggest transmission through a pipe? Walk inside elevator, stand next to infected person, catch virus. Or touch the same button. Or maybe they each visited the same corner market within minutes of one another."
2020-02-11 15:42,"Given---at least as it appears from this and other articles---that officials have not yet isolated every conceivable person infected with the virus, or even precisely the numbers of ways the virus transmits (water pipes, possibly?), I think the overall numbers are encouraging.  

If 1016 +/- deaths in a nearly six-week period seem alarming, they really are not.  So far, the numbers aren't any worse than the average flu season toll of most westernized industrial nations.  And as officials corral and isolate potential victims, and the incubation waiting-period passes (they believe, 2 weeks), we'll start to see a diminishing in the infection and subsequent mortality rate. 

The coronavirus is likely at its peak---that is, if everyone, especially individual citizens everywhere, mostly in China, do what is asked of them.  Two weeks of quarantine is a small price to pay for saving humanity; washing your hands is good business with or without a pandemic."
2020-02-11 15:50,How has this virus seriously not affected the stock market yet? China is the second-largest economy on the planet. China is basically closed for business.
2020-02-11 15:53,"Interestingly I have something to add. We are a NYC based AC energy company with a Hong Kong subsidiary to sell our product in China. Things had come to full stop until last night when our chinese customer, a large manufacturer ordered shipment. This means their factory is back in full production. We may be an anomaly but it’s a good sign."
2020-02-11 15:55,"I don't understand how the quarantine process aboard the Diamond Princess cruise ship will work. Given there are healthy people and sick people together, doesn't the 14 day quarantine process essentially start over every time a new case is identified?"
2020-02-11 16:43,"The number of infected has fallen below 3000 a day.  That is certainly not bad news.  But it's unclear to me if these are newly infected or newly reported.  Also whenever the numbers suspiciously smooth, I become skeptical.

The narrative sounds more Alarming.  Cluster of infections in Tianjin.  Same-building transmission in Hong Kong.  Super spreader from Britain.  Diamond Princess as an incubator at sea. The saga of the cruise ship Westerdam eerily reminiscent of MS St Louis.

I can't figure out how to square decreasing numbers with increasingly more concerning narratives."
2020-02-11 14:50,"When will America's ' Stable Genius' and ' Really Smart' President who knows more about everything than anybody be called upon by China and the world to fix and solve this coronavirus crisis?

Or is this a task for Jared ' Hidden Genius' Kushner?"
2020-02-11 15:58,"Re: American released from quarantine then testing positive:

How long was the person held in quarantine?
Is the quarantine duration every quarantine site is using is incorrect?"
2020-02-11 16:21,"""One of the people evacuated to the United States from Wuhan last week is infected with the coronavirus, U.C. San Diego Health said in a statement. The Centers for Disease Control shared the diagnosis on Monday, the hospital said; the patient had previously been discharged after testing negative.

The patient, one of 167 passengers on a State Department-arranged flight, has since returned to the hospital near Marine Corps Air Station Miramar in San Diego.""

This is tucked into a piece filled with disturbing facts. Testing procedures are ineffective if a person can be cleared yet be infected. How many of the 4 people in direct contact on the flight became infected? How many of those infected individuals also tested negative because they were asymptomatic? If this infected individual was cleared, (as the others on the plane were), how many have they now infected when placed into Federal quarantine with all who were not infected? 

There's no ability to control the spread of this virus, just slow the spread. Each person infected with this pathogen can remain asymptomatic for 14 days yet readily transmit the disease, and transmit it through a building. Testing via symptomatology is not working. A vaccine is a long way down the road, but there needs to be a way to quickly develop a test for anti-bodies. Testing based on symptomatology means an unspecified number of infected individuals are cleared and released when they're actually infected, contagious, and spreading the disease."
2020-02-11 16:24,"42000 of 1.7 Billion. We should moderate our hysteria. Hearing that visits of Chinese restaurants in Chinatown New York dropped 50 percent is ridiculous. Do people think the virus comes from kung pao chicken or wantan? 
Some health education desperately needed."
2020-02-11 16:27,"The numbers of infections and fatalities from China seem highly suspect. China began an unprecedented quarantine of 11 million citizens after reporting just a couple dozen deaths from nCoV-2019. We have no idea how many of those confined to their homes in mainland China, now upwards of 50 million people, are sick or have died. This is one of the major problems of dealing with a totalitarian government that has a history of censoring communication."
2020-02-11 16:39,"With more reports of obscure and mysterious outbreaks of the coronavirus, the Trump administration is proposing to cut three billion dollars intended for global health in 2021 according to the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. 

This is the sort of crisis where having a president like Trump may be the greatest danger Americans face from the expanding epidemic."
2020-02-11 16:16,"To criticize the Chinese government in China is Forbidden, because he criticized the government.

We criticize right here in America. Demonstrations.  Right. Deaths.

But here we don’t overturn the government. The same person criticized the Chinese government. So we as Americans may applaud him for his criticism...  But he is after the government!

Right here As a transition The presidents recognize each other. And they may totally disagree."
2020-02-11 16:34,"The virus is passed through the air ducts on board ships and buildings.  By quarantining people on a ship, in particular, it just ensures the virus’s spread. 

Without secure, autonomous venting systems, as hospitals constructed during the Ebola outbreak,  more people will die."
2020-02-11 16:20,I'm interested in learning more about his experiences after having caught the virus. What were his symptoms? How did he feel as it progressed? How long was he sick with it?
2020-02-11 16:41,"Not in any way to diminish the suffering from and impact of the Wuhan coronavirus, but let's keep a little perspective. The C.D.C. estimates that up to 42.9 million people got sick during the 2018-2019 flu season, 647,000 people were hospitalized and 61,200 died. In the current season, half over, it is estimated there have been at least 22 million flu illnesses, 210,000 hospitalizations and 12,000 deaths from flu.

While we appropriately pay serious attention to the evolution of Wuhan coronavirus, let us not let it cloud out the ongoing risks from flu and the need to act accordingly. If quarantining cities in China, cruise ships, and others is sensible and legitimate, maybe we should consider the same for anti-vaxxers here in America.

As with the 40,000 annual deaths in vehicle crashes, the flu is not a ""sexy"" news story, so does not get nearly the coverage deserved. On the other hand, the Wuhan coronavirus, makes for excellent clickbait. That is not to deny the legitimate stories, many hooked to the unknown elements. Novelty and the unknown get attention, until what was once novel becomes the new normal. That's human nature. Think of suicide bombers. In the mid 2000s when they started happening as more than a rare ""curiosity"", each had huge news coverage, complete with psychological ""analyses"", biographies, detailed descriptions, etc. Now when there is a suicide bombing, it is simply covered as any other bombing, ""suicide"" simply being consigned to being an adjective."
2020-02-11 16:55,"It is highly unlikely that the virus moved “through a pipe” from one apartment to another in the building. Far more likely is that one person was infected, touched railings or a door handle and then the other person also touched that area within a short period of time and then touched their own mouth, nose or face. This is why washing your hands frequently and trying as hard as you can not to touch your face at any time is so critical."
2020-02-11 17:03,"It looks dangerous to walk through a disinfectant fog as shown in the photo in this article. Is it safe to inhale?  I hope the spray is not alcohol or bleach or one of the quaternary ammonium compounds, all of which could cause respiratory problems."
2020-02-11 17:05,"In a dystopian country, a deadly virus and quarantines that feature citizens being dragged out of homes.  And it's not in a work of fiction."
2020-02-11 17:19,"Modest proposals


Hypothesis:  “The heat, generally speaking, kills this kind of virus,” Trump said in the State Dining Room.

Why wait until the heat comes in April.  Bring on the heat 

Tests:

1.  Require indoor temperature to be set to 75F (24C) or above.  

2.  Get cruise ships sailing to warmer ports or ocean spots where air temperatures exceed 75F.  Refueling/stocking can be done by submarines and/or ships.

Thesis 2:  higher  humidity limits virus survival - April showers bring May flowers, higher humidity and less flu too.

Tests:

1.  Keep mucous membranes hydrated -  require 8 or more glasses of water a day; require saline nose spray 2 times a day.

2.  Require indoor humidity above 35% and below 60%.  Educate public on proper use of home humidifiers.

2020-02-11 18:19,"I believe I am one of the few people who knows the cause of the coronavirus:  it is massive lack of curiosity by scientists.  While the epidemic rages, people look for how to protect themselves and nowhere do I read any account of scientists examining the cause of the epidemic.  All that seems to be written about is how to contain it.  Is it a mere coincidence that China is one of the most polluted countries in the world? Is it likely that this massive pollution together with overpopulation has severely disrupted the ecosystem? Is it possible that this severe disruption in the ecosystem has led to the growth of this and perhaps previous epidemics such as SARS?  I don't read anywhere that anyone is looking at these questions.  Maybe this line of thinking will end up as a cul de sac, but it would be nice if I saw some scientists at least asking questions like these."
2020-02-11 17:52,"According to Dr Gabriel Leung,  dean of medicine at the University of Hong Kong and delegate to WHO, mortality from  the 2003 SARS in Hong Kong was about 17% (<a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/10/opinion/coronavirus-china-research.html"" target=""_blank"">https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/10/opinion/coronavirus-china-research.html</a>). But COVID-19 is about 2% in China and that percentage has held steady for several days. 
The numbers indicate that many lessons from SARS, including starting with the protection of Health Care Workers, have been implemented successfully internationally. In spite of the horror stories, most people in the areas with high infection rates are observing quarantine measures (in in the press we are seeing fewer references to 'draconian measures' as the scope of the disease becomes known)."

2020-02-11 17:57,"Can we just stop with the Flu comparisons? 

This virus *will be* endemic in the population, just like the Flu and just like the 4 other common Coronaviruses. Containment is slowing but not stopping the spread and we’ll see exponential growth again once it hits India, Africa etc. The question is *when* not *if*.

So the best case scenario is that it’s no worse than Flu. The Flu doesn’t go away so we now have twice as many hospitalizations and deaths — this would strain any health system.

I hesitate to think of the worst case, but perhaps the most likely case is that it’s about 10x worse than the flu (CFR 1 percent), and now we have 11x as many hospitalizations and deaths than usual.

Comparing this to the Flu is completely shortsighted."
2020-02-11 18:32,"In my opinion the U.S. should temporarily halt all travel in and out of Asia. I personally know two people who have returned from Hong Kong this week.

2020-02-11 18:27,I'm wondering about how well a person is protected from the COVID-19 virus by wearing a face mask.  If the virus is transmitted through the air could it be contracted through the eyes of someone wearing a face mask covering only nose and mouth?

Lyme disease, Coxsackie virus, Marburg virus, Lassa fever, Ebola virus, West Nile virus, German measles, and so on. It seems reasonable to conclude that the scientific community has a buckled under pressure from China to abstain from linking the name of the disease to the city of its origin. If they don't want it named after the city of Wuhan, then why not call it Li Wenliang Virus in honor of the Chinese doctor who was arrested for warning his colleagues about the new illness only to succumb to it shortly thereafter."

Let's also be clear on this point, it is not a threat to human kind, it is a threat to the wealth of our cruel and criminal overlords. Their concern is for the money, not the people."
2020-02-11 20:38,"I fail to see how the word ""corona,"" which means the gas surrounding a star or ""the part of the body resembling a crown"" references any PLACE.

Am I missing something?

I'm quite convinced most people will continue to call it the coronavirus, rather than COVID-19, which is a more technical and scarier-sounding name."

2020-02-11 20:35,"Exactly how did calling it ""The Coronavirus"" stigmatize anyone? It isn't like any news agency was calling it ""The Chinavirus"" or the ""Wuhan Flu."" Does this mean that the epicenter of the outbreak will no longer be identified as a city in China?

Still, it is reassuring that W.H.O. is on the job! Maybe they should use multicolored protective suits instead of white ones?"
2020-02-11 20:38,"For the World Health Organisation, apparently it's more important to control the narrative than it is to fight the disease.  

And so, the World Health Organisation re-brands Coronavirus.  Henceforth, we muppets must call it Covid-19.  

By dissociating it with any person, place or animal, we will not stigmatize the virus.  

Is this not crazy?  

People are dying and our esteemed international health organisation is treating the crisis as a re-branding exercise."
2020-02-11 20:08,Get a timeline of recent diseases in China. I highly doubt it is from bats or snakes. Most likely insects. A few months ago about 120 million pigs were put down or killed in China. However knowing how corruption exists in China most likely 20% we’re not put down. Corruption is widespread in China. Scientist should study weather pigs are still infected and if any insects may have spread to different regions and this is the cause of the current virus.
2020-02-11 20:11,"The spread of the virus to patients and doctors in a Wuhan hospital has made it clear this is as an airborne respiratory virus like SARs. It is much more contagious than the flu and people on a cruise ship are infecting each other despite being isolated. In Hong Kong a resident was infected through a “pipe”. Was “air vent” lost in translation? 

If Indonesia, Africa, and India do not report a surge in cases despite having many tourists then is R_0 < 1 those countries?

It is likely the water droplets loaded with viruses quickly evaporate in hotter climates. The sun is out longer and is more intense and quickly destroys the exposed viruses with UV light. Many poorer countries are tropical and do not have central heat and AC. Their air conditioners are single room units that do not share duct work with other rooms. That may be enough to reduce the number of new people each infected person infects to less than one. 

Hopefully, the virus will not burn through poorer countries. Unfortunately malaria, dengue, and zika are primarily spread through mosquitos in hot climates instead of being airborne."
2020-02-11 20:38,"What's wrong with calling it what it is? It's the Wuhan virus and China really does need to ""clean up its act"" with regard to allowing the mixing of animals and people in close quarters.  Every flu originates in China because of its lax public health. Let's not protect China by sanitizing the name of the latest, deadly virus from China--the Wuhan virus."

2020-02-11 21:54,"Another reader has asked key questions about the virus.  The best summary in a major medical journal so far is in the current issue of the New England Journal of Medicine.  That study and two others are readily available online.  

Epidemiologists, infectious disease specialists and virologists are still working out the transmission characteristics of this virus.  Other key questions include:  How many people can have COVID-19 infections and have minimal symptoms?  Does the virus affect children differently than adults?  For people who eventually develop symptoms, when in the prodrome do they shed virus?  And when seemingly better, do they continue to shed virus?  

I am not a public health officer, but I think it is safe to assure the public that this situation, international in scope, is not receiving the type of ""it can't happen here"" dismissal that we saw in 1981 at the advent of HIV.  Scientists learned much from SARS, and that knowledge seems to be translating to the management of COVID-19.  I was in practice and in a role to formulate some local plans for SARS when it was a threat, and the current response seems to be faster and more comprehensive than was the case previously.  

Initially, the response in China seemed to be influenced by local politics.  I hope that politicians around the world will get out of the way, let the experts do their jobs to bring this under control."
2020-02-11 21:35,The pattern emerges. Name change...blame local officials....all that is happening here is that Xi is protecting Xi. I bet that his minders made sure that those around him in the photo op were flunkies. Someone so important cannot actually show real leadership and visit the real centre of the outbreak. What a third rate performance. I still think that the knives will be out for him from many powerful people that he has removed from office over the last few years. He can pretend that he is the all powerful leader...but he is politically wounded maybe fatally especially after the long running Honk Kong debacle. Leader for life...do not bet on it.

It seems inevitable that at least people with the virus will enter the US undetected through this vector. As xenophobic as Trump is toward Hispanics with his crazed obsession over a senseless wall on the southern border, this should serve as an ironic wakeup call.  By myopically promoting his wall, Trump has failed to grasp the big picture which could have lent assistance to California and New York in dealing humanely with their share of immigrants--some of whom may carry the virus."

2020-02-11 22:31,"Today on NPR, I heard a report China is asking that countries pare back travel bans because of the economic fallout. When WHO delayed declaring a global emergency a short two weeks ago, it seemed China's economic interests were part of the equation. Will efforts to contain this virus bow to economic pressure? Is that good epidemiology? 

In todays Upshot, Dr. Carroll tells us we can wash our hands well, get flu shots, clean our phones, computers etc.and hope our employers allow those with illness to stay home. That was NOT reassuring, nor is the call to lower travel restrictions at this time. Should we be concerned that China is beginning to consider containment a failure and now pushing economics ahead of safety? 

WHO feels compelled to play political semantics with the very name of the virus. China certainly will be appreciative if they are not in fact the one's to stipulate it. I was hoping to hear much more substantive info from WHO as was portended by yesterdays op-ed by a top Hong Kong epidemiologist. 

Todays WHO release reminds me of that scene in Lord of the Rings where the Ents engage at great length in a discussion our little hobbits believe to be a resolution to war but, hours later, turns out to have been only their ponderous Entish greeting. Please, WHO, give us the info you are convened to piece together, not semantics. And do tell us if you and the powers that be are throwing us under the bus in favor of economics. I need time to stock up on soap."

""I'm staying at home now, we all fine with the virus.
All of us are advised to stay in home, it can help to protect us from the risk.
All of us, goverment and people, are doing our best to solve this problem, and everything I think it's better soon.""

2020-02-12 0:03,"For layman's purposes, I think this virus will always be thought of as Wuhan coronavirus. If WHO and China are so concerned with stigma does that suggest that there is some expectation that this outbreak is going to leave a strong dark mark on our collective consciousness? Their action may unintentionally decrease confidence this can be defeated, given the apparent tint of propaganda. I understand they don't want to stigmatize the region, but pretending we don't know where this originated seems a little pointless and may reduce the impetus to change the animal husbandry and cuisine practices that led to this outbreak in the first place as well as the bureaucratic structures that delayed response. Accountability begets behavior change."

It was discovered that a sewer line draining sewage from a high-rise apartment building was damaged by utility workers. The result was a seemingly minor water leak that emerged from  the adjacent lawn and flowed slowly across the sidewalk near the building entrance. The pedestrian traffic picked up the contamination on the soles of their shoes and tracked the virus into the apartment tower. This created a cluster of infections that mystified investigators. With the population densities, the exponential increeases in the volume, speed & range of travel, the complexity of infrastrupture combined with the political imperative to avoid responsibility in the Chinese political system, the outcome of this epidemic is self-evident."

Should we all wear masks in public and, if so, what kind? Where are they available?

This country is full of garden-variety flu cases. At what point should anyone worry about flu-like symptoms? Do we visit the doctor, the ER, or stay home and isolate?

Should anyone with cold-like symptoms be staying home now or is that over-reaction?

It is common practice to name viruses after the location of their first outbreak (Ebola virus, Zika virus, Norwalk virus, etc.), their discoverers (Epstein-Barr virus, Theiler’s disease virus, etc), or their symptoms (dengue viruses, SARS, HIV, papillomaviruses, etc.).  China must’ve spent a lot of money lobbying the WHO for the name devoid of reference to Wuhan, which would have not been any more “stigmatizing” than the examples I mentioned above (note, most of which are in underdeveloped countries).

2. The port cities of Northern China send many (~thousands, if not tens of thousands) sex workers abroad to the major and minor cities of Asia. If they went home for CNY and are able to return to where they work (CNY just ended Sunday), that could spread the virus widely.

Some are hollering ""xenophobia"" because other countries are keeping out mainlanders. That's ridiculous. The fact is the virus originated in China and China has tens of thousands of infections we know about so far. Any ban will be temporary. To succumb to political correctness and not ban travel to one's country from the mainland would be dereliction of duty by one's leaders. There's nothing racist or xenophobic about taking temporary precautions based on what we know and, more, what we don't know about the virus. Better safe than sorry makes a lot of sense here."
2020-02-28 14:21,"I remember reading that bats are the source of the corona virus, not pangolins. The medicine loophole is so large you could drive a truck through it. The Chinese don’t eat bat soup and pangolin scales as food, but as medicine. Bat soup is supposed to be a cure for insomnia. I have no idea what pangolin scales are supposed to do. 

The Chinese authorities are never going to legislate away the Chinese people’s belief in folk medicine. 

This new law does not address the real problem. It’s just desperate PR."
2020-02-28 14:11,"Pointless unless it is a total ban with strict enforcement and punishment for those caught violating it. In other words, pointless."
2020-02-28 15:11,But one theory runs that the use of pangolin scales as medicine started the transference of Covid-19 to humans. So this ban is useless from the start.
2020-02-28 15:30,"The real problem is one of cultural differences among peoples of the world-- and culture is hard to change via legislation, at least in the short run.  The consumption of what the West refers to as wild animals is common not only in China but others parts of the Asian world as well, both for food and presumed medical and health benefits.  But legislation-- and its rigorous enforcement-- can work: note the use of mandatory helmets for motorcyclists in the US, seat belts for auto drivers and passengers, and restrictions on youth tobacco consumption.  The government of China needs to not only legislate reforms but also reinforce them through publicity campaigns and demonstration effects by recognized thought leaders.  The latter will ultimately determine the outcome."
2020-02-28 15:56,"If the World Health Organization has any mandate, this is it. In a world where people are traveling in the millions, there has to be a standard of health and sanitation that nations must meet in order for people to travel across national boundaries. WHO should mandate a set of specifications for hygiene and sanitation where food preparation is concerned. Apart from protecting global health from pandemics, it would provide minimal food safety for everyone."
2020-02-28 16:03,"I hope other countries and NGOs can put gentle pressure on China's government to close and the medicinal loophole and actually enforce the law, but not so much sudden pressure that it causes China's leadership outrage and prompts it to turn retaining folk medicine into a nationalistic rallying cry."
2020-02-28 19:49,"As long as there is a demand from people who are willing to pay the price there will continue to be a market for these animals and animal parts. It may go deeper underground but it won't go away until the established behaviors and traditions fade into history. Covid 19's object lesson in the hazards of these practices hopefully will blunt the demand considerably. That might be one good outcome from this pandemic. However, people will be people."
2020-02-28 23:33,"For all practical purposes, a ban on medicinal purposes would have had no teeth.  Poachers are prime for a ban; it means profit.  It’s better that the medicinal demand diminish generationally, while the supply is regulated for disease more strictly."
2020-02-29 2:23,Trade in wild animals should be banned full stop. Using TCM as a defense for some trading is anachronistic and not defensible
2020-02-28 15:46,"China is not the only country that practices the wild animal food trade. All of Asia is in the business along with Europe, South and Central America, Africa etc. This incidence came from China but it does not give that country exclusivity.  The trade will not stop because there will always be a demand. Whatever the animal is that generated this virus will be something different the next time. This is reality and we are not being fully informed about the way this virus is being transmitted or precautionary measures that should be taken.  I am glad I live in a state that has absentee ballots.  Just listen to Trump, “In a couple of months it will just magically go away!”  YEAH RIGHT!"
2020-02-28 21:41,"China must finally outlaw this practice. Considering the risks of global pandemic, why do they continue?  It makes no sense whatsoever."
2020-02-28 22:22,"Well if pangolin breeding and farming works out, that is not exactly a loophole, as the farm raised animals are not “wild”."
2020-02-29 3:20,"If the covid - 19 is indeed from pangolins, this is nothing short of poetic justice.  That the most hunted and trafficked animal in the world is the cause of a viral outbreak that exacts revenge for the flagrant abuse of animal life by humans is sweet justice.  It's about time.  Animals deserve much, much better than what humans have done against them."
2020-02-29 3:32,"This is simply unacceptable. As long as China encourages and promotes traditional medicine using animal parts from threatened and endangered animals, the illegal wildlife trade will flourish. The use of animal products in Chinese traditional medicine is driving a surge in illegal trafficking of wildlife.  Conservation groups are rightly alarmed about the growing use of threatened species in traditional Chinese medicines; the industry has accounted for more than three-quarters of the trade in endangered wildlife products in Hong Kong over the past 5 years. Last year, record volumes of parts from threatened and endangered species, including pangolin scales, rhino horns, and tiger parts, were seized by authorities in Hong Kong. Rhino horn and pangolin scales are not medically beneficial. As everyone knows, they are made of keratin, the same substance in hair and fingernails. Instead of viewing animals as commodities, the Chinese people need to start questioning and raising awareness about these practices much more, and move away from them to more effective and sustainable ""cures"" and products. Herbal products are highly effective, they do not cause viral pandemics, and they do not depete engangered wildlife and slaughter other living and feeling creatures. If you really must have keratin, there are substitutes that don’t depend on killing rhinos and pangolins."
2020-02-28 22:44,"China's traditional practice of slaughtering mass numbers of dogs and wildlife, many of which are endangered, has been immoral and inhumane all on its own. And now, these greedy and nefarious practices have resulted in a global public health emergency. This so-called ban is a wink to those who will continue to extort for the multi-billion dollar market that is snake oil remedies. The Chinese government, in their omnipresent subterfuge and spin, knows it.  

Where are our global leaders and the steady public outcry condemning and even sanctioning China for their dangerous recklessness?"

2020-02-29 2:05,"Welcome to the 21st century, China!"
2020-02-28 16:56,We need genuine action to pressure China to really ban exploitation of wildlife. We are seeing thousands of people die now because of this negligence. That is absolutely unacceptable practice that needs to end.￼
2020-02-28 18:38,"Outrageous. The Chinese traditional medicine, fur, and research industries are wiping so many endangered/threatened wild/captive animals off the face of the earth. This egregious loophole is completely unacceptable and must be vigorously challenged."
2020-03-09 14:20,"This is one of the best pieces I’ve read on the virus. I had been wondering if the Chinese government wasn’t sending people back to work too early. 

I guess we’ll find out soon enough."
2020-03-09 16:15,As an infectious disease expert I find the article very accurate and often had to explain this exact concept not only to patients but to doctors. Diagnosis if viral infections by PCR does not correlate with infectivity. The virus may be neutralized but PCR can detect viral remnants. Only culture can determine shedding of contagious virus.
2020-03-09 17:31,"In 2009, my then 15 year old daughter got Swine Flu, H1N1, she was out of school for 2 weeks. She was given the all clear to go back to school. 2 weeks later, I got a call from her, Mom, I am sick it is the swine flu again. I took her to the doctor, they insisted she couldn’t have it again. But they did the test again positive for Swine Flu, H1N1. She had a fever for the next 7 weeks. We went to two different infectious disease doctors. One tried to say she had Mono, my response was she had that in 6 th grade and missed 3 weeks of school. Some blood work came back she had something in that family too. But it was still coming back as H1N1.  My primary doctor told me finaly that there were other doctors reporting similar cases of two infections to the medical journals. She was going to publish my daughter, who never got completely better. We spent years did she now have Fibromyalgia or Rhuematoid Arthritis.. she is 25 now and still has lingering side effects."

2020-03-09 21:20,"@Dawn is correct. The presence of genetic material from Covid-19 in a recovering patient does not prove that the patient is infectious or relapsing. 

Twenty years or so ago, when PCR replaced culture for gonorrhea, we saw a similar phenomenon. Previously physicians commonly did a follow up culture as a test of cure, to ensure treatment was successful. With PCR the test could remain positive for weeks because fragments of dead bacteria remained present."
2020-03-10 3:10,"When the patients are coronavirus positive the 2nd instance, are they symptomatic or newly symptomatic?"
2020-03-10 3:17,"“What is the nature of immunity to this virus after infection?” Dr. Lipsitch said. “That’s a research question that’s urgent.”

If we're some ways off knowing what is the nature of protective immunity against this virus, how are we to have a protective vaccine within a year (or a few months per our president)?"
2020-02-28 15:43,"It is extremely dangerous for the Trump administration to downplay the potential effects of the coronavirus outbreak. While the overall death rate may be lower than MERS or EBOLA, 2-3% is high enough to kill thousands of people if there is a widespread outbreak in the US. Data suggests that death rates in older individuals may be significantly higher. The media is not inventing these facts, nor are the media responsible for closing factories in China and elsewhere, disrupting global supply chains. It is frightening (but not surprising) to watch how Trump is downplaying this potential crisis for political gain."

2020-02-28 16:01,"The stock markets rise or fall depends on the collective assessment of all investors, including professional traders.  Trump  can control public opinion in other areas by lies and distortion.  He cannot control the sentiment of money managers across the globe.  On top of that, the market had gone straight up for ten years and was going to have a correction at some point.  He took full responsibility for the market's rise during the past three years.  Now he wants to blame the media and politicians for the fall.  This is going to wear out very quickly."

By his being slow to act, cutting programs whose purpose was to identify and prepare for pandemics, downplay the spread of coronavirus in the US, and not allowing the CDC to do their job, this disease will spread faster with dire consequences.  Wall Street can finally see through Trump's lies and deceit realizing that there is no one leading us through this crisis."

I kept thinking of psychiatric terms as I read through Mulvaney's comments, like ""delusional"", ""persecution complex"", etc. He feels it's all a fiction being pushed by the press? Which as we know, means any media outlet not named FOX News. There is something truly toxic that gets spread around among Trump's team and allies, and it's worse than coronavirus."
2020-02-28 16:03,"Trumps minimization of a health crisis that will and is affecting us globally, is another example of how he is incapable of not making everything about him.  To the contrary, his response  and minimizations are having the opposite effect, making American's feel less safe and vulnerable.  Assigning Pence to be the channel for the CDC is a form of censoring that limits full disclosure and skews information in support of a stock market (and election) rather than the good of the citizens in our country.  This is a travesty...ongoing, and abhorrent."

2020-02-28 15:50,"Mr. Mulvaney's comment about the President's son is ludicrous. Of course the media would be covering the impeachment extensively. By the way, the impeachment was caused by the President's impeachable acts. His job was to ensure that he had a solid administration to protect public health irregardless of the impeachment. And to suggest the public should be more interested in his relationship with his son is just more about how to deflect from the critical issues of his presidency. Lack of preparation on this quickly spreading virus, the declining stock market, that's all on you,  President Trump."

It was Mr. Trump who fired all the pandemic experts in the White House, and it was his lackadaisical response to the crisis, similar to what he did (or did not do) in response to hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico, what has taken us to where we are now with the Covir-19."

He really IS getting everything out of it that he can - a cult following, a crooked DOJ and Supreme Court, and money in his and his family's pockets to name just a few. The media doesn't talk about Barron?? I think it's been made pretty clear that his sacred name CANNOT be mentioned no matter what, no? Trump ""calls to check in on him?"" That's how a parent shows love and concern for a child? And signing over the responsibility for handling the coronavirus to Mike Pence is an insult to our medical professionals in the CDC. Let the experts handle this global outbreak, NOT a religious fanatic who will more than likely suggest that it's all in god's hands and that all we need to do is pray. In what world is Mike Mulvaney living? Oh yeah, that's right. The one where his lord and saviour, DJT, can do no wrong."

When other administration officials speak honestly and clearly about the steps they are taking to contain this meanacing threat, the news media will report every word, and the nation will be watchful. When administration statements and actions have been depoliticized, the news media will report it; and when administration officials stop acting as though they were being victimized and maligned by the news media, and stop shifting blame and responsibility from themselves, the news media will spread that good news to the nation."
2020-02-28 15:47,"A President can be reassuring without minimizing. This President has no idea how to do it or for that matter what to do; for example, his decision to override the CDC recommendations about putting potentially infected people on a public plane and not having had the CDC prepare and train workers who helped those people.  If he was doing anything besides tweeting about other people, it sure wasn't helpful or appropriate planning and training.

This is when the chickens come home to roost. Sadly, in a time of great need for leadership and smart decision-making, the American people will finally see that we have neither in this president. The emperor has no clothes, and Americans will be the ones to suffer.

2020-02-28 15:45,"Mr. Mulvaney, If Trump weren't trying so hard to silence scientists in the CDC, media coverage would be better.  Trump is much more worried about the stock market than in making sure CO-VID 19 doesn't spread.  At this moment, there aren't many cases and we want to keep it that way.  Let the scientists speak without contradicting them.  When Trump contradicts his own scientists people will start worrying that he is trying to hide something.

Their disregard of truth still matters: they try to distract from anything of substance. Unfortunately, the media treats what they say in a traditional way, which is to say, as if there is some authentically important content. That is an appropriate standard, but there may be a way to signal that there is nothing new or noteworthy here. My fantasy is that news outlets would allot a small space, perhaps a corner of a page, for such non-stories, under a heading that says, This Is What Trump and His Retainers Say Today."

2600 passengers boarded the Diamond Princess weeks ago---healthy enough to vacation. Now, FIVE are dead.

To put things in perspective:

- this does not happen with flu
- this does not happen with a norovirus
- this does not happen with accidents
- this does not happen on much bigger cruise ships with double the population
- this does not happen in month long cruises
- this does not happen on translantic cruises when everyone is cooped up.

There is no universe that I know of when 5 passengers die from an illness contracted on a ship.

This thing is highly contagious, yes, but now I also think it kills pretty efficiently."

2020-02-28 16:04,"No, we are not talking about the coronavirus because we want to bring down Trump, we are talking about it because it is a serious public health threat, which we are woefully unprepared for.  

Even now each year, during the predictable influenza season, our healthcare facilities are strained to the point where patients need to be diverted from many hospitals, as there are not facilities nor capacity to care for them.  I have seen times when the nursing supervisor states there are no more hospital beds or ICU beds in the whole large city, and the paramedics need to divert 60 miles to transport patients out to rural (dairy cow farmland) areas to get admitted.

Governors and Federal authorities need to talk to their State Army Reserve and National Guard Commands to get a headcount on number of beds that could be mobilized quickly if needed, as they did adroitly in China once they became honest and publicly announced the problem.  My fear is that we are not talking openly enough to our Governors to start making appropriate contingency plans.  A 600 personnel Army Combat Support Hospital (CSH) can erect a 125 bed or more hospital in just hours for isolation and care of patients.  FEMA would be involved as well.  The public should be briefed on these contingency plans.  

As Field Marshall Rommel told his subordinates in WWII, “give it to me straight, bad news doesn’t get better with time.”  

The time to prepare is NOW."

This is so right, but THE STOCK MARKET WILL REBOUNCE SND SEE ABOVE. The wide spread hysteria and economic panic are much worse than the coronavirus. Mortality is between 0.4-2% dependent on the age group and mainly effects risk groups with other compromising health issues, and this is without taking in account the many cases of asymptomatic people, in which case the mortality would be similar to the common flu. Bottom line coronavirus infection though novel is not much worse than the flu. Caution is warrant but public Hysteria due to media coverage is uncalled for. Finally, I am disgusted by how many journalists and readers blame Trump for the situation or mention him in articles responses related to the disease.  He did a fantastic job in a balanced sober presentation with Pence the CDC and the NIH on Wednesday."
2020-02-28 16:01,"Mulvaney is right: I was hoping that the Access Hollywood tape would bring down Trump; I was counting on all the cabinet-level scandals (Tom Price, Flynn, Pruitt, Wilbur Ross, Barr, ...) would bring him down; I was sure that the Ukrainian fiasco would lead to his impeachment and removal; I hoped that the cuts to healthcare and education coupled with windfalls to the 1% would reduce his support. But I don’t and won’t hope that the Coronavirus will be the thing that brings him down, because for that to happen, lots of innocent people will die. 

Ms Karni is right too: these complaints that the media are working against Trump are just laughable. The media here in France are just as focused on the virus, and their angle, like that of media around the world, is that this is a pandemic that threatens the citizens of their countries. The stock market has had some tremors related to the virus before this week, but the difference now is that the disease has spread much more widely and threatens many more people and a greater share of the economy. That’s not the media; it is the facts.

Mulvaney, Trump and all his other apologists are seeking someone else to blame for the bad news they cannot control. So long as the markets were going up, Trump basked in their levity; now that they are falling, it’s always someone else’s fault. Typical juvenile psychology."
2020-02-28 16:09,"Mr. Mulvaney will soon learn, viruses are apolitical."
2020-02-28 16:01,"Mr Mulvaney is not a physician or scientist..his opinion on the seriousness of this virus is virtually useless..the lack of Presidential control of what is happening, the many different stories and the misinformation is what is making everyone panic...try to get a straight answer that is accurate from this Administration - not possible."
2020-02-28 15:59,"Right, if it was only about a pandemic virus the media wouldn’t be covering it at all. The virus wasn’t Trump’s fault but the lack of planning and the lack of leadership in dealing with it are. We need a new President. Any competent Adult 2020."
2020-02-28 15:48,"I hope to read about this entire charade in the history books. 

And history may not be so kind to the current occupant of the White House, how much he doth protest."
2020-02-28 15:44,"Good to know!  That this could bring down the Occupant.

Thanks for the heads up, Mulvaney."
2020-02-28 15:50,"The insanity continues.  I've long ago stopped trying to figure out not just Donald Trump's dangerous instability -- that's a given -- but the obsequious, sycophantic, jejune smallness of the ""mature"" (mostly) men who follow him.  Do they ever wake up and look at themselves in the mirror in the morning and think ""Oh my God.  I'm humiliating myself?  I'm a laughingstock?  And I'm hurting people?""  Except it is no laughing matter at this point in the first truly global emergency confronting this President."
2020-02-28 15:45,"On the one hand, the self-absorption of this administration is absurd and dangerous. Not everything is about you, Donald. On the other, they're right to call out the media's role in creating (and profiting from) panic. Broken clocks and all, I suppose."
2020-02-28 16:05,"Of course the media doesn't cover the loving relationship President Trump has with Barron (or any of his kids) because that doesn't fit the nasty character they like to pain the president as. Mulvaney echoed the president in terms of the scale of CoronaVirus, and he is right --- the media is overblowing the whole thing. Not to minimize it either, but the mass hysteria the media is trying to create is irresponsible and shameful"
2020-02-28 15:45,"The Flu does kill people but not at a rate of 2-3%.  But his assertion that this is not Ebola, so why should we care is so typical of this ""Let them eat cake"" administration."
2020-02-28 16:00,"Mick Mulvaney is a loose cannon-he can be counted on to say the wrong thing at the wrong time.It is disheartening to realize every day that Trump’s loyalists will do or say anything to make him look good.They should cease their senseless,babble and speak with intelligence and compassion.The stock market is waiting for expert information-they deal with data.The haphazard, emotional response by Trump and Co. is what is spooking them."
2020-02-28 16:00,"Does he realize this kind of misinformation can literally cause people to die? Whether he does or no, what does that say about our current government?"
2020-02-28 16:10,"Mulvaney is stumbling all over himself to insinuate himself back into Trump's good graces, yet his unconscious has betrayed him once more.  Bringing up Barron (not to be confused with the screwball comedy Bringing up Baby) is yet another gaffe by the man who once called his boss a ""terrible human being."""
2020-02-28 16:10,"This is another one of Mulvaney’s “get over it” moments.  Trump PR is always to advance Trump, by either a) blaming it on the media or Democrats, despite the facts, or b) in this case, using Pence as a clearinghouse for statements so they can be sanitized as much as possible in Trump’s favor.  Under this arrangement, do you have confidence that you will get the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, in a timely manor?  That went out the window on Jan 20, 2017."
2020-02-28 15:51,Mr. Mulvaney's astonishing comments raise a fair question as to whether he is utterly unprincipled or uncommonly ill-informed. Or both.
2020-02-28 16:18,"Supposedly the "" great Trump economy"" was spurred by Trump's GOP's opposition to public service, public infrastructure, and public health services. So why not consider the coronavirus response (Pence praying it away) as a related economic factor?"
2020-02-28 16:08,"To quote Ralph Waldo Emerson “Great men, great nations, have not been boasters and buffoons, but perceivers of the terror of life, and have manned themselves to face it.”  It's frightening to see a blame-game unfold at the highest levels when preparation and planning are required to meet the looming threat."
2020-02-28 16:08,"I'd already decided to refer directly to the CDC website for updates about the coronavirus, as I expect them to remain unfiltered by any political agenda.  Mulvaney's ridiculous assertion that news about the coronavirus is meant to ""take down"" Donald Trump, makes me even LESS likely to trust any statements on the topic from the White House.  If they believe this to be true, then wouldn't they be motivated to downplay the actual impact?  [btw, this might sound like a conspiracy theory.  I just mean to say that I don't expect them to issue factual statements.]

btw, this CDC article provides a quick summary of COVID-19, MERS, and SARS:

2020-02-28 16:20,"I disagree that the media is conspiring to bring down Trump with their coverage

However, I've been reading a great deal of the coverage in both the UK and America and I'm finding it very difficult to get a firm grasp on how dangerous the situation is. 

For example, if the mortality rate is south of 2 percent and most of those deaths are either elderly people and/or those with pre-existing conditions (not too dissimilar from the season flu), what makes this a global emergency?"
2020-02-28 15:39,"You know what? The president would not even be associated with the virus if he had allowed the professionals to do their jobs and kept his know nothing nose out of things. 
But of course he and his minions already know this. They are sticking their noses in to this and pretty much every other thing the press reports on that goes big to create the fiction that he has a say in everything that happens in the USA. It is also a pathetic attention grab from a bunch of insecure adults whose fecklessness in all things would justify that insecurity were they not congenitally so."
2020-02-28 15:44,"Mr. Mulvaney seems to be as adept at blathering nonsense as the President himself. I don’t know if he was always like this, or if he has studied the President to be so."
2020-02-28 15:48,"Distract. Gaslight. Rinse. Repeat. Status quo. 

This potential pandemic threat requires we break the status quo and ""look to the helpers"". That would be the professionals at the CDC, the NIH, National Foundation for Infectious Diseases ... certainly not Pence, or that incompetent sycophant ""acting"" as the head of DHS!"
2020-02-28 15:59,"“ ‘He’s huge, but he’s still very young...’ Mr. Mulvaney said of Barron...”

I suppose when you’re around a person who is fond of using the word “huge” or rather “yuge” as in “my yuge inaugural crowds” or my “yuge share of the popular vote,” it’s normal that you would also use the word, but I think that someone should tell Mick Mulvaney that describing Barron Trump as “huge” is just plain weird."
2020-02-28 16:03,"Given Mulvaney's past erratic behavior I am not surprised to hear this kind of pure crazy from him. It is nonetheless terrifying that a top administration official is trivializing COVID19, comparing it to the flu. An intelligent, coordinated, sustained response to this threat would ease a lot of my fears. Instead, we get this."
2020-02-28 16:04,"So its not about the COVID-19, it's about trump and the lying news media, is that right?  Mulvaney is trying to spin the Big Lie in the Orwellian fashion:  the bigger the lie, the harder it is to refute, at least for the true believers of Trump the Messiah.  This brown-nosing Mulvaney statement is up there in its mendacity with Xi, Putin,  and Kim Jong-un.
When the virus is eventually rampant throughout our communities, then these sycophants, and trump as well, will act as if this lie was never said.  Our democracy is sorely tested, if not already broken beyond repair.  Lest we forget, all news is about the magnificent trump."
2020-02-28 16:07,"Where do these neo-Luddite zealots dream up the idea that an epidemic starting in China is a Democratic plot?  Add Mulvaney's inane comments to today's tweet by Donald Jr, saying Democrats actually hope Americans die just to hurt Trump's re-election.  It's no longer a WH bubble — it's a doomsday cult."
2020-02-28 16:08,"Will nothing pierce the bubble of utter narcissism that surrounds this President and his circle of sycophants? (That’s a rhetorical question - of course not!). To put it another way: it’s not all about you, dude."
2020-02-28 15:47,"Always the victim, always whining...and always, always cheating. 
When other people are getting sick, it is about him."
2020-02-28 15:48,"As usual, it’s all about “him”."
2020-02-28 15:49,"This is truly disgusting. The paranoia and blindness of this administration is unprecedented. The scariest part is that a good number of Americans seem to believe this hype. 

If 2% of those with coronavirus continue to die, and if just 500 million catch it, that means 10 million people will die. This administration would rather we TOm about Barron."
2020-02-28 15:52,Sounds like narcissistic personality disorder may be as contagious as the corona virus. Sometimes it’s not about Trump hard as that may be to believe.
2020-02-28 16:10,"We can all rest now.  Mick Mulvaney, that eminent infectious disease specialist, has spoken."
2020-02-28 15:48,"This is just nauseating. There’s a world wide crisis at hand, and these guys are promoting Trump as some kind of victim. 

Do any members of this Administration ever think about the concerns and problems of everyday citizens? Silly question, I know."
2020-02-28 15:51,"Or maybe the decision to cut the CDC budget for pandemic response is what will bring down the president, Mick, eh?"
2020-02-28 15:52,Are there any adults left in the White House?
2020-02-28 15:55,"Seems to me what Mulvaney is expressing here is his fear that the way Trump is handling this crisis may ""bring down the president"".  So, to the White House the most important thing is how this situation is going to affect Trump's reelection campaign. Protecting the country is a secondary concern.  Meanwhile, the CDC, the WHO and every other public health official in the world is telling us there is serious cause for concern. But that makes no difference at all to the world's most powerful victim and the assortment of boobs and hacks that surround him."
2020-02-28 16:10,"This just shows how deceitful the trump crowds truly is. Instead of showing leadership they cry about trump's image, which only gets worse as more people see how inept trump and all his sycophants truly are. He boasts a rising stock market and then blames others on the down side. Wake up, America. It is more clear than ever that we have a ship of fools inside the White House and in control of our Senate. The coronavirus does not bow to trump or anyone else. If we allow these people to continue, millions of peoople will be hurt, many will die."
2020-02-28 16:11,"We are at the beginning of that moment where we see how far and wide ranging the damage can be allowing a corrupt ""stable genius"" to assume the highest office in the land.

You really didn't think we'd get out of this unscathed did you?"
2020-02-28 16:15,"Here is what people should be most afraid of:

Donald Trump on Tuesday night:

""We have 15 people infected but not too bad, but there are only 9 that are serious but they are from Japan we felt we had to bring over, we didn't really have to, but they are citizens and Congress....Congress gave us too much money, but we will take it, not as much for the Wall...and the 15 patients are doing great...China, China is doing a great job just like India, but everything is ok, many people say we couldn't get it done, but the Coronavirus is in good shape, I mean, the 15 people are in good shape, because we are great""

Donald Trump speech before appointing Pence as Health ""Czar"".

Ignorant, stupid, uninformed, blather gibberish from the President of the United States.

Please read it Mike Mulvaney. Trump is hopelessly out of his league. 


Trump should have been impeached for gross ignorance.

When Mike Mulvaney visits some of those 8400 ""under monitoring"" I will listen to him."
2020-02-28 15:45,"Nonsense. If it “brings down Trump,” it’s the direct result of the failings of his administration, the media is just doing it’s job covering the virus, you know, what the media does in a free country."
2020-02-28 15:46,"Just how was someone so obviously uneducated, unintelligent and delusionally partisan ever allowed to hold any position much less a governmental position of any type?  With the possibility of a pandemic in this country it is clear that these people are a danger to themselves not to mention the entire country."
2020-02-28 15:48,"Mulvaney, like his lord and master and other members of the cult, is a shameless prevaricator whose commentary proceeds with obvious indifference to empirical reality and truth. His loyalty oath is not to the US Constitution or to the norms of civil society, but to the self-dealing agenda of the liar in chief. His days in power, to the detriment of the nation, hopefully like those of his boss, are numbered."
2020-02-28 15:52,Absurd  Trump and his lap dogs are clueless narcissists  What is scary about this situation is Mulvaney and the other Trump pets are misleading the public. The Coronavirus is not the flu..it is much worst.  Once it gets in the lungs it kills lung cells making it impossible to breath..a lot of people end up on respirators and IV's there is no cure other than palliative care if it becomes a pandemic it's going to overwhelm our already terrible health care system The Trump crowd in the white house better start listening to the scientists and health professionals to effectively control this problem They have gutted our government removing scientists doctors health care specialists replacing them with yes men. What they are doing now is just down right criminal.
2020-02-28 15:56,"The amount of incompetence in this administration is staggering. Mix that with their  malice, greed, and appetite for total power, and   the threat of a dystopian future that fueled so many novels and films may quickly become our new reality. #Vote2020 like your life depended on it ... because it does."
2020-02-28 16:02,"I had forgotten how, as a group, Trump’s appointees are so unhinged; Mick Mulvaney just reminded me in dramatic fashion!"
2020-02-28 16:03,"I am in stunned amazement having read what Mick Mulvaney said. The coronavirus is an incredibly serious matter. Anyone that does not take it seriously is begging for trouble. And to spin this matter to show that the media is using the news to bring down a President in absolutely incredible. But as we know the Trump Administration operates in its own fantasyland, fabricating the news of the real world into its own warped and twisted version. To the media, keep up your reporting on this matter. The world needs to know the reality of this matter. Especially when a dunce like Mr. Mulvaney has the gall to utter the words he did."
2020-02-28 15:41,Blame everyone else. Same old same old.
2020-02-28 15:49,"Eight years? He's just trying to torture us now. I can only hope everyone with an ounce of common sense, or intelligence, or morality, or compassion will go to the polls in November and vote this president and his ship of fools out of office. Four more years? There won't be anything good of America left."
2020-02-28 15:51,"It sounds like Mr. Mulvaney is freaking out. Perhaps he was a bit too optimistic with his investments? 

President Trump is free to tweet or post photos or video ad infinitum about his relationship with his youngest son."
2020-02-28 15:54,"I remember the news picture of Trump watching his little boy having fun pretending to mow the White House lawn.

Wait, that was someone else's kid in a publicity stunt.  Here's Trump's real take on Barron and his mother, during a discussion about vaping:

“She’s got a son, together, that’s a beautiful young man, and she feels very, very strongly about it.”
 — Donald Trump

""That"" refers to his youngest child.  So Mulvaney should just shut up before he digs a deeper hole."
2020-02-28 15:57,"Even after three years of absorbing the trump administration's behavior, the inward focus on nothing-but-trump within the administration, even as the nation faces a true pandemic crisis, remains staggering."
2020-02-28 16:11,"Chances are good that what Mulvaney says publicly, Trump says privately. 

That's what makes the article worth reading. Disturbing, but it's better to know."
2020-02-28 16:08,"Shorter Mulvaney:  Donald Trump seeks every possible way to promote himself and his family business at the expense of every working American citizen.  Anything or anybody that prevents Trump's self-promotion is a problem that must be ignored, cynically re-defined, deceitfully lied about, or eliminated."
2020-02-28 16:05,"If the Trump administration truly thinks the coronavirus outbreak will have little effect on U.S. death rates, they should be cooperating  with emphasizing the threat. Then, when the virus burned itself out in an anti-climactic couple of months,  they could take credit for the minimal impact due to their brilliant management. The truth is, no one knows for sure, and they're unable to strategize that far ahead. The Trump Administration is reacting according to it's usual pattern--REACTING hour by hour--rather than taking pro-active steps and establishing trust in communication by making realistic, fact-based statements. Since they're reacting hour by hour, all they're focusing on is trying to prop up the financial markets.  If it all goes horribly wrong, they'll start accusing Democrats of poisoning the wells just to beat Trump."
2020-02-28 16:13,It would be interesting to know how many cheered Mr. Mulvaney’s remarks but are also carrying sanitizing wipes at the conference to prevent coronavirus infection.
2020-02-28 16:10,"I think mankind is far enough along with self awareness to know by now that everything the president and Mr. Mulvaney accuse the ""other side"" of is something that resides in their own minds.  His criticism reveals precisely the way he/they would ""play it""  were the shoe on the other foot.  Instead of showing genuine concern over a building crisis, Mr. Mulvaney treats the whole episode as a political gambit."
2020-02-28 16:10,"""I'm going to get as much out of it (the Presidency) as I can?""
That rings true. Trump IS trying to get as much out of being president as he can: as much power, as much adulation, and last, but not least, as much money."
2020-02-28 15:57,"Yes, Mr Mulvaney, when I first saw a report in the South China Morning Post in early January, I thought to myself ""The Hong Kongers out to get Trump"". And this last weekend I read the report in the Corriere dells Sera describing the situation outside Milan, I thought to myself ""Ah, the Italians are in league with the Hong Kongers"". Even the Wall Street Journal has jumped on this media band wagon to get Trump.

Or perhaps, Mr Mulvaney, this is a serious global issue that has everyone's attention. Perhaps it does deserve the attention of the President as well."
2020-02-28 15:35,"The President needs no help in being brought down.  The NY Southern District Court will handle things conveniently afterwards, we trust."
2020-02-28 15:37,"Yep, it's all about King Donald. Every story, worldwide, is either for him or against him. No global crisis, just another made-up story meant to discredit The Perfect One.

Mick is just trying to gain favor from The Boss for his previous missteps before the press. Watch him squirm."
2020-02-28 15:46,"This is just bizarre, although why am I surprised.

Mulvaney is a problem.  Even the GOP thinks so, since he carelessly flaps his jaws.  Trump is unwilling to make him the permanent COS - that should tell us something."
2020-02-28 15:51,"“The flu kills people,” he said. “This is not Ebola. It’s not SARS, it’s not MERS. It’s not a death sentence, it’s not the same as the Ebola crisis.”
I think he's saying, ""Get over it""."
2020-02-28 15:57,"Just because 75% of people infected do not die does NOT mean that the virus is something to ignore. Would Trump and Mulvaney prefer ""the media"" to wait until 300,000 people are infected? A million? What number would satisfy them? It's all about Trump, even deaths that could be prevented. Great leader, we are on our own."
2020-02-28 15:58,"People getting sick in more than 50 countries & many dying but the White House response is that it’s all about Trump. 
November can’t come fast enough. If you aren’t registered to vote, PLEASE do so."
2020-02-28 15:59,"Having watch the Fox morning show, I know at least one media source is completely down playing this pandemic:  Fox news.  They, like Muvaney, insist this is no big deal. They don't seem to understand the uniqueness of this break out virus.  It's just another media hoax to show the president's incompetence, they say.  They insist that the administration has the very best, most advanced response on going, and that all is well.  
Too bad the facts and the disease don't back up those assertions.  In fact, any other administration would have NIH and CDC spoke people out talking to the press and media about specific responses and means of handing this disease.  Instead we have Mulvaney, Pence, Trump Jr. out telling us there is no problem."
2020-02-28 16:00,"Mr. Mulvaney's comments are shameful. Is there nothing this administration will not use to: 1. villanize the press and 2.) score bizarre political points with? The coronavirus and our response to it must become a ""stand together"" moment for the country--or the consequences will be that much worse. Where is the true leadership vs the petulant whining that we get so often?"
2020-02-28 16:08,These are chillingly dangerous words. People are dying from a cause that is still a great mystery to scientists. This man obviously doesn't ride the subways. His paranoia is misplaced.
2020-02-28 16:10,"I'm wondering whether this messaging was approved by the VP/COVID-19 czar, Mike Pence. It's packed with lies. The media most definitely covered Trump's order to close down air traffic between the US and China. I was traveling in Asia and got the word via the NYTimes.

Mulvaney seems to be saying that reporting of bad news (disease spread, deaths, collapse of financial markets) is only being done to damage his boss' reelection chances. This is facially absurd. And Mulvaney's other points are strawman arguments. No one claims that everyone is going to die. But absent a vigorous public health response, many people could die. It is a potential crisis here in the US, and Mulvaney (and presumably Trump and Pence) feels that we should just all chill a bit."
2020-02-28 16:13,"There’s seldom any point in following the exact details of Mulvaney’s lying and hallucinations; point is, it’s all ridiculous nonsense that adults are expected to be confused by, and Trumpists are expected to believe."
2020-02-28 16:06,"Other efforts to bring down the president: the existence of facts; the fact that it is legal to sell stocks; the fact that viruses do not understand talking points; the fact that vaccines cannot created by segments on Fox News attacking the deep state; and so on. Indeed, the whole world is against Trump."
2020-02-28 16:07,"Yes, Mr. Mulvaney, ""'The flue kills people."" and the coronavirus is a form of flu.  In fact, many health professionals believe it will be the new form of annual flu we need to confront.  But, to engage in ""blame the media"" belies the fact that this is a global pandemic that is causing markets to fall around the globe.  Are they all out to get Trump? This is the kind of paranoid delusion spin so characteristic of the Trump administration and Trump's narcissism. The administration would be better off if they focused on protecting their own Health and Human Services (HHS) employees who, despite alarms and complaints of a ""deep state"" career, high-trained public servant, were ignored thus allowing the HHS employees to be exposed to the coronavirus and apparently contracting it. And then, in typical Trump ""kill the messenger"" fashion, the whistleblower has been removed, demoted and threatened with being fired despite having just received numerous awards. Mulvaney's ignorance and ineptitude only contributes to the lack of trust in the Trump administration.  And that contributes to the uncertainty that is rattling the markets here."
2020-02-28 16:11,"Re ”acting White House chief of staff”

Everyone in this administration is acting, in the sense that acting is the opposite of real life. 

We are living in a dystopian nightmare about America. I hope we wake up in November."
2020-02-28 16:12,"It’s telling and of utmost concern that the first widely publicized statement of the Acting Chief of Staff about the coronavirus emergency is to make it all about the President, rather than the issue at hand - namely, what should we do in the immediate term do deal with a “Code Red” situation."
2020-02-28 16:23,No way to know the effect of COVID 19 on individuals in the US.  American companies' reliance on China and may other countries for supply chain components will surely be affected and travel related industries and countries which rely on travel for their economy will be affected.  BTW investors are spooked by the information and the uncertainty is surely a factor in the market sell offs.  I can't help but wonder if Trump's constant lying throughout his life and administration is contributing to the market uncertainty.  Americans are fine with a lying president of the IRAs are unaffected but not if they are.
2020-02-28 15:48,"Well, well...Trump consistently attacks the free press on a regular basis and now they're crying about not getting press time for what they want.  The scene is complete.  The White House is a bin of  dysfunctional discontents."
2020-02-28 15:45,"Well. This is no surprise! 

We went from ""The buck stops here"" to ""Poor me, I've got whistleblowing traitors in my administration, my Intelligence Agencies is a deep-state plotting against me, my CDC and EPA are filled with scientists who don't understand how to follow my policies (they keep bugging me about science!), and now the media is piling on about this trivial coronavirus when they instead should all be talking about my tweet regarding the Kardashians!""

Everything in the world is someone else's fault! If only they'd just leave the Stable Genius alone."
2020-02-28 15:53,"First, no one has to do anything to “bring down Trump”. He does a fine job of it all on his own. If it weren’t for his delusional followers pretending his behavior is okay he would have been gone some time ago.

Secondly, why is it every time the conservatives get together they go straight to the dark side and crazy talk? They are some really twisted people."
2020-02-28 15:51,The many bizarre comments from the many bizarre people in this bizarre administration stems from the lack of a logical and cohesive policy to accomplish anything other than to make the rich richer.

Yet I don't know of a single person among my friends, family, or neighbors who has ever mentioned they know someone who had died of the flu.

How about you?"
2020-02-28 15:44,"The paranoia is striking, especially from a spokesperson. But the loser mentality stands out even more. These are supposed to be rugged individualists!"
2020-02-28 16:15,Seriously. Keep this in perspective. Mulvaney is speaking at CPAC. Not exactly a venue where any critical thinking occurs.
2020-02-28 15:42,"""Speaking at the Conservative Political Action Conference, an annual gathering of conservative activists, Mr. Mulvaney played down concerns about the virus...""

Dear Mick,
This is the coronavirus speaking.
You may downplay me but remember, I'm a virus.  
I don't recognize party affiliations.
I don't care what you or the press say about me.
My job is to infect and I don't care who I infect.
Sincerely,
Your Coronavirus"
2020-02-28 16:16,"There are so many things wrong with this. The attack on the free press. The obfuscation of the facts to try to make Trump look better. The strange 'look at how much Trump like's his son' comment. 

Feels more like North Korea than the United States."
2020-02-28 15:48,"Right, because anything bad that ever happens on a national or international scale is part of a deep state conspiracy against King Trump. All one can say is look at the markets. They are pricing in economic disruptions that will result from the virus. No, all is not well in the land ruled by an ignorant, egotistical man and his cowardly lackeys who subscribe to conspiracy theories and can't be bothered to do the hard work of governing."
2020-02-28 16:11,"""“The reason you’re seeing so much attention to it today is that they think this is going to be the thing that brings down the president,” he added. “That’s what this is all about it.”""

Well have you read press and watched news from around the world? Is it a worldwide plot to bring down the president?

It's getting so much attention because it fundamentally affects the economy and the potential health of billions of people.

If Trump and sycophants like Mick Mulvaney crash and burn politically along the way, good riddance!"
2020-02-28 16:10,"Mulvaney has it backward. The JOB of the media, both print and electronic, is to report news. If that news happens to be critical of his boss, that should be reported. FOX ""News"" can handle the rest. Sadly, this president and his sycophants think that everyone is out to get them, so their whole job has become that of defenders of a very fragile egomaniac. They have become so transparent in this that it's amazing that some are still buying Trump's legitimacy."
2020-02-28 16:04,"If this is just ""fake news,"" then why don't the good people at CPAC welcome Trump's brave federal employees who were sent to quarantine areas with no protective gear? Invite them as special guests. Show us all what a farce this is."
2020-02-28 15:45,"This is what happens when the president you serve lies more than 15,000 times over a three year period.  Why should anyone believe him, especially now that he blames the democrats who are running for president on the stock market sell off?

Deal with it."
2020-02-28 16:15,"Instead of making sure that Americans get information from scientists and experts, we get talking points about how unfair the media is to trump from Mulvaney and echoed on FOX. Now the distraction about Barron who is still a child and should be left alone and has been left alone per his mother's wishes.   Let us hear from Anthony Fauci about this virus.  Truth is the enemy of this administration."
2020-02-28 16:18,"Enough is Enough.

Call your Senators and wake up the GOP ones living in the WH bubble opium den and get some sane leadership going. 

Then in November cut Trump loose - he chose to live by the market and is getting slaughtered by Reality, probably for the first time in his life."
2020-02-28 16:21,Mulvaney graduated with honors from the Sean Spicer School of Prevarication. How does he stay upright without a spine?
2020-02-28 16:10,"This from the man who announced quid pro quos are done routinely, and then walked it back."
2020-02-28 16:14,"Mulvaney, Trump’s Igor has obviously been struck with his masters worst afflictions: wanton ignorance, bouts of panic mixed with bombast, and an overwhelming penchant for murdering the facts.

Just what America needs in the face of a potentially devastating health and related economic crisis."
2020-02-28 16:30,"After reading experts’ recommendations to have basic medications on hand, yesterday I stopped in at the CVS pharmacy in my local Target. The pharmacist made it clear she thought I was part of a community overreaction. “The media has done its job,” she said with a smirk. She was dismissive of my questions (also not well informed about symptoms). 

As I moved off to figure out what to buy, I could hear parts of a more engaged and sympathetic conversation between the pharmacist and the next customer. It sounded disparaging of public concern and, at least on the customer’s side, defensive of Trump. 

It’s disturbing and dangerous if people on the frontlines of healthcare are letting their politics determine whether and how they do their work."
2020-02-28 16:20,"The House should ask the head of the CDC and other government experts to testify before them weekly, in order to get around the gag order Trump has sentenced them to.  They have been told they have to clear any statements with Pence before saying anything.  This is UNACCEPTABLE and endangers the American public."
2020-02-28 16:19,"Earlier in February Mr. Trump stated for the media that US ""has shut down Coronavirus threat"". Around the time more cases were being confirmed by Chinese authorities, Mr. Trump, reportedly, said that we will benefit from the Coronavirus. Ironically, an administration that makes such irresponsible statements to the media, blames the coverage instead of addressing its own chaotic inadequacy in the case of a public health emergency."
2020-02-28 16:21,"Yes, that's probably why Japan closed all its schools: fear of Trump not being re-elected."
2020-02-28 16:21,"The irony is that all of these apparatchiks telling people that there's nothing to fear is only adding fuel to the fire that there is a lot to fear. A transparent administration providing sober facts and plans, and revealing all that they know, would have contained much of the panic we have seen this week. However, the war on truth--and the epistemological crisis it has created--has led most people and companies to realize that they can't believe anything anymore. Thus, we have panic. The only way this unwinds is the hard way. Live by the lie, die by the lie."
2020-02-28 16:31,"As Chief of Staff and representative spokesperson for Donald Trump, we’re going to remember you said this Mick Mulvaney, every last word of it.  I must assume the White House has “approved “ your messaging.   As for the virus, I can only hope your ridiculous and utterly irresponsible downplay of its potential is true.  Maybe the NYT should reprint this in the months ahead just to keep us reassured and feeling confident in the gutted health and science departments of our federal government.  Who needs them when we have experts like you, Mick Mulvaney to explain it to us?  Sorry guy, but the health and welfare of the American people is far greater than the political agenda of the White House.  Most people would rather be safe than sorry."
2020-02-28 15:40,"No one wants this virus to take on epidemic status, but this is an administration asleep at the wheel. 

And Mulvaney's claim of Trump's loving relationship with his son is a joke. If it were so obvious it would be news. The only loving relationship Trump is having is with himself."
2020-02-28 15:43,If Mulvaney’s lies were true it would be the best thing for American Democracy that could possibly happen. Let’s hope that this pandemic is fake news AND that it spells the end of Trump and the GOP lie that capitalism and businessmen can solve every social problem.
2020-02-28 15:45,"The chaos at the WH reminds me of the PR guy in Iraq when the war was going on.

He said the Iraqi troops were victorious and right after he said it he went into hiding. 

Trump and his toadies are doing the same thing."
2020-02-28 15:46,"This is the weirdest response ever! What do Mulvaney’s comments about Barron being young “He’s huge, but he’s still very young. He was 10 or something like that when the president was elected,” have anything to do with ANYTHING??

Also, when are we going to find out more about Trump firing the entire pandemic response team two years ago in order to cut costs? (via Snopes)"
2020-02-28 15:53,"How insane and irresponsible can you get! First Trump, then Pence and now Mulvaney opining on the ""facts"" about the present Coronavirus epidemic/pandemic. They are ""informing"" the public about the situation. They have no formal schooling in virology or medicine for that matter. 

I, as a doctor, am really hoping that someone who actually knows what they're talking about will soon defy their ""gag order"" to come out from behind the ""iron curtain"" that is White House status quo and truly inform Americans about the dangers before them. The victims in China can attest to how it has really been."
2020-02-28 16:07,But that’s by and large true
2020-02-28 16:08,"Mulvaney asserts that Trump did not sleep during his trip from Delhi to DC. Let's see, that's 7472 miles at 631 mph (maximum reported speed of Air Force One), or a minimum of 12 hours of flying. Why would a man with the nuclear code need to sleep when Syria and Russia are a Turkey's throat? Better to spend the time tweeting about whatever grievance is offending the president at the moment. Sleep tight, America."
2020-02-28 16:10,"This is Donald Trump's Marie Antoinette moment. 
""I call my kid and no one covers it!""

Mulvaney is the living metaphor of what happens when you put people in charge who have no actual principles. He is Smithers.
He is paid to see the Coronavirus situation and EVERY situation through the Trump beer-goggles that are a requirement of every one of the people in his administration. 

You cannot make pronouncements from the WH about a worldwide virus and say it is ""the flu"". You cannot quote radio hosts who have felonies for abusing drugs like Limbaugh or pass bad information like Pence does and expect to have even a shred of credibility. Trump keeps doing his schtick- verbatim from his rally to the podium in front of a presidential seal. Pitiful."
2020-02-28 16:14,"If there is a war between reality and propaganda, I would place my bets on reality.

It all depends on how forceful the reality is, of course, but people dying generally has a big impact on those around them. Of course, there are those people who will be fooled all the time - there certainly have been numerous doomsday cults in my lifetime. It's unclear how many Trumpsters will follow him down a rabbit hole of denial, but I suspect that a large number were on the Trump train because they thought they could profit from it. There may come a tipping point where the rats jump off the sinking ship and only the conspiracy theorists, white supremacists, and terminally religious are left. I don't expect the captain to go down with the ship. He'll look for an exit as he blames everyone else for his fate."
2020-02-28 16:19,Is there an acting secretary of propaganda?
2020-02-28 16:22,"I would rather hear from this administration exactly what concrete steps, all of them, it is taking to deal with he possibility of a coronavirus pandemic here in America he USA."
2020-02-28 16:16,"Yeah, Mr. Mulvaney. We all want people to get sick, incur medical debt, and maybe die just to remove the President. We would inflict pain and suffering on others just to prove a point. Or to win a point. 

Except, many of us are just not cruel. We would never spin this for political gain. We see that what hurts one part of our population hurts us all. 

Maybe that’s hard for you to understand, Mr. Mulvaney, given the warped sense of right and wrong that pervades this Administration."
2020-02-28 16:16,"With leadership like this, it's a miracle the markets haven't dropped further."
2020-02-28 16:19,"#trumpvirus is trending on Twitter and it should be. Electing an unintelligent, volatile, anti-science, disorganized, anti-infrastructure man with a terrible track record in management and leadership, this country is immensely more vulnerable than it should be. 

I say it just about every day, but let me shout it today: THANK GOD I live in NYC. Wealthy, organized, sensible, experienced NYC."
2020-02-28 16:20,"Coronavirus is a Health issue. We must not portrait the virus, the sicks and the death toll as a political stunt. Otherwise it is irreverent to the human race and also a threat to the human race. Fact check, it is true that the US inclined on the preference of impeachment over a more dangerous issue when the virus started to spread around the globe. Another impartial fact is; it gives an impression that the democratic side seemed to be indifferent to the general well-being of the citizens. From the media, in their eyes there is nothing but the political drama and the presidential election. The impeachment which was panned across for more than a year, how much government budgets, time and efforts were spent? Hypothetically, if the impeachment was used as a tool to gain advantages for the election, it is not acceptable and not about justice. Time allocation is scarce. How can the current government focus on current affairs domestically and internationally if further drama keeps coming ashore. I do not agree with the current administration but the fact is how much care to the human race is shown in current political atmosphere, late night show hosts, news anchors who have familial relationship with political figures? Almost zero. A similar case in swine flu happened more than 10 years ago. With the shortage of vaccines, President Obama was criticized. Both situations imbue a fear in human race. However the point is the world still needs time to investigate."
2020-02-28 16:22,"Anything that might put Trump in a bad light is ""Fake News"". Right. Well, this particular Fake News may turn out to be the one thing that tired line will just not work on. Viruses, as best we know, are immune to rhetoric."
2020-02-28 16:15,"Although the Coronavirus is not within Thump’s control, he has brought much of the media attention onto his administration’s ineptitude. Trump took credit for the rising stock market - always risky when what goes up will inevitably come down. His numerous lies and distrust of science has ruined  his credibility. His focus on economic cost and impact on him getting re-elected is typical of his narcissism, but highlights his lack of empathy. We are now paying the price for his hollowing out federal agencies and filling important positions with syncopates, as testing kits are in short supply and communication remain at best muddled. His appearance on TV the other night exposed all of this and more. So no, Mick Mulvaney and right wing media, this is not the Democrats taking advantage of a situation to criticize Trump, but is purely self-inflicted."
2020-02-28 16:17,"For once, and only once, I think Trump is right. The MSM-driven hysteria is causing more damage than the disease. 

What if the market sell-off quickly translates into pink slips, with people then also loosing their health insurance? Deaths from untreated illnesses could surpass deaths from this so-called pandemic."
2020-02-28 16:19,"Of course this administration would say that.  Human life means nothing to them unless it is their own.   I cannot get my head around the fact that there is nothing this administration won't stoop to in consolidating its destruction of our nation, our principles, our democracy and our Constitution.

Of COURSE he said that."
2020-02-28 15:49,"Elect a clown, expect a circus. Mulvaney is just the latest edition of ringmaster."
2020-02-28 15:49,I feel like I am watching an extended version of Dumb and Dumber anytime someone on Trump's staff speaks.
2020-02-28 15:50,"Here's a thought:  Do Trump supporters think the Corona virus is a real infectious disease, or do they think it's something Democrats made up to bring down the imPOTUS?"
2020-02-28 15:59,This is just Mulvaney trying to get back into his boss's good graces.  Ain't gonna work.
2020-02-28 16:01,"It's evident we have a 100% incompetent administration.  For him to say this is sickening.  Trillions of dollars of lost ""wealth,"" potentially huge numbers of sick people, and it's all about Trump?  I for one am not especially interested in seeing my family or friends or community get smothered by this virus outbreak just to ""bring down Trump.""  These people don't even know what it is to protect or lead America.  They are a virus themselves.
Thank you, Senators, for keeping these extremely dangerous and stupid  people in office."
2020-02-28 16:10,"Dear Mick and Donald, Don’t flatter yourselves. It’s not all about you. And you can’t make it about you. But, you certainly are a factor in the horrible news and market fall."
2020-02-28 16:16,Right. The whole world is just all about him. He takes paranoia and victimhood to a whole new level. Enough already.
2020-02-28 16:22,"That’s just ridiculous!

Was 9/11 covered by the media to bring down Bush? Or any other natural catastrophe to bring down a politician?

Mulvaney, this is a serious medical issue, not a political one. Have a cup of tea and get your brain running again."
2020-02-28 16:24,"You’re dead wrong Mr. Mulvaney. The media isn’t covering the coronavirus because it’s trying to bring down Trump. Don’t you see? The media CREATED the coronavirus because it’s trying to bring down Trump. 

/s"
2020-02-28 16:30,"The conservative media went nuts when an impeachment inquiry witness simply MENTIONED Barron Trump, even though she said absolutely nothing negative about the kid. Imagine what would happen if the NYT and other papers started doing articles about him."
2020-02-28 16:18,"Oh please, he's capable of doing that all by himself."
2020-02-28 16:28,"If the president's incompetence brings him down Mr.  Mulvaney,  so be it.  He's the one who fired Obama's team of experts.  It's just such a shame Nick,  that he's worried more about how he looks than the effects the disease can have on our citizens.  One thing Nick,  can you please teach him how to spell Coronavirus?"
2020-02-28 16:32,"Is the Italian press reporting on their Covid 19 disaster in order to bring down Trump?

Is the Japanese government closing public schools for a month in order to bring down Trump?

Is the Iranian government announcing the death of their deputy health minister from Covid 19 in order to bring down Trump?

Please, Mr Mulvaney, grow up!  Get real!"
2020-02-28 16:12,"Mulvaney sounds like a whiner. Indeed, The New York Times did cover the corona virus 5 weeks ago, in January when there were only 200 Chinese people sick. That was big news. And he sounds just like Trump, giving a directive (like not writing about Barron) and then complaining that we dont write about him!"
2020-02-28 16:17,Did he get approval from Mike Pence to discuss these matters?
2020-02-28 16:18,"“Why didn’t you hear about it?” Mr. Mulvaney said of travel restrictions that were widely covered in the news media. “What was still going on four or five weeks ago? Impeachment, that’s all the press wanted to talk about.”

maybe on Fox but the sentient beings on the planet were watching this unfold since it was first announced. it seems the WH has switched from blaming socialist democrats to blaming a virus.... funny, there is nothing more virulent than Donald Trump."
2020-02-28 16:24,"Be a man Mick and own the potential carnage you and this administration have wrought. Gutting the Department of Health and Human Services may come back to bite you and those you love in the the long run. When you look in the mirror tonight, give yourself a pat on the back for a job well done..."
2020-02-28 16:29,This is exhausting.  Was there an epidemiologist in the CPAC  house when Mulvaney gave his lunatic rant?  Trump cut money to the CDC and shut down the National Security Council’s  global health security unit.  Now those short-sighted action are coming back to bite them politically.  Mulvaney is an exhaust port of Trump's excuse machine.  What else can he do other than flail around and shriek from the White House enemies list?
2020-02-28 16:31,"The total lack of responsibility for their positions of these people is stunning. They don't seem to have any sense of the magnitude of every statement they make, starting with trump himself of course. But lackeys like Mulvaney seem to drunk the cool-aid and blather on hysterically while a true crisis is knocking at their door. This is what they do when the chips are down? Shameful and ridiculous hacks in over their heads."
2020-02-28 16:18,"Will there ever be a time when conservatives decide that they have had enough of these incompetent hacks in the administration who will do or say anything to advance their careers? Mick Mulvaney is opining on health issues? And Larry Kudlow too? Does anyone actually think these two clowns have a clue about this subject?

It seems like long ago that some right-wingers got a kick out of calling liberals and Democrats “snowflakes” because they thought they complained too much (I guess). Now, there’s an outbreak of a very contagious disease in China, and they just whine about it and blame the media and the Democrats, or worse, let their paranoid delusions run wild and say it’s a conspiracy to bring down Trump. Really, who wants this kind of administration running the country?"
2020-02-28 16:27,"Poor, pitiful Trump, this tragic, downtrodden paragon of unearned enmity. How all the saints and Job and Jesus must weep for you, O Great Afflicted One!
Gimme a break.
Here's a fella born with a gilt spoon up his bum, showered with every privilege, every golden opportunity, and a multitude of timely bailouts and in spite of all these advantages he's just a whiney sleazebag complaining constantly about a system rigged against him. As if."
2020-02-28 16:18,The Trump administration:  The boys who cried wolf.
2020-02-28 16:21,"It's not about you, Mick, or your boss, though you imagine this to be the case."
2020-02-28 16:23,"People should be watching Fox News, where the Dow is up 5,000 points this week and the first sunny day will end the spread of Coronavirus."
2020-02-28 16:29,"if you claim credit for the market's robust surge, the slide might be considered your responsibility.   this President and his enablers exhaust me."
2020-02-28 16:30,"Trump's motivation in being president is clear by what he said, ""I’ve only got eight years, I’m going to get as much out of it as I can."" He is trying to get as much richer as possible by being president. His motive is laid bare for all to see, to be simple, crass greed.

A science-denying, isolationist grifter cannot possibly lead against a global scientific threat like this virus."
2020-02-28 16:30,"The hypocrisy of Mick Mulvaney knows no bounds. He is a self-described member of the Tea Party, which shrilly reamed out President Obama for his response to Ebola. Of course, as history knows, Obama’s response to Ebola played a key role in limiting its global impact. But now Mick has the temerity to whine about the media focusing so much attention on what Trump is doing about covid-19.

And what is it that Trump is doing? Well, long after things started spinning out of control, he put Pence in charge. Maybe it’s just me, but I thought Pence already had a job. Then Trump’s HHS secretary punishes the whistleblower who thankfully stepped forward to point out that health care workers weren’t appropriately trained to receive infected patients from the cruise ship. Oh, and then there’s the small point that Trump’s proposed federal budget cuts millions from disaster response.

And of course the media all around the world is also covering the epidemic way too much. According to Mulvaney’s gospel, such nefarious activity is aimed only at bringing down Trump."
2020-02-28 16:08,"The trump administration comments is the following-me me me me me me me Ivanka me me me me me me, deep state, me,me me, dems bad, me,me ,me.  In three plus years they do not have government positions filled.  They do not have loyalty or trust of either its citizens or government workers.  

There is no coordination, everyone trying to figure out who is the leader.  Trump put Pence as the fall guy. The gop need to get a handle on this, the red states are the most  vulnerable￼, low health care, bad health, poor diet, and over 50.  


This was extremely predictable, governments like companies need some type of risk precautions.  Trump does not go past the brain upgrade from spray tan.q

The USA is going to become like the bankrupt Casio in Atlantic City.  

Trump,has not surround himself with good people, he pays the Video game of whack a mole.  If anyone speaks out he tweets them back in his hole.  No government Bureaucrat wants to leave their home of 20 years and end up counting cars on the freeway.  The people who work for the government have a greater risk assessment then the Tr￼ump administration 

 So just like in Puerto Rico, Florida, Syria, Yemen, Africa, the borders of USA and Mexico people are going to die.  Not because it is a issue of national importance,  not to protect USA citizens, not to protect our allies.

It all about Trump.  Me me me 

“As Rome burned Nero played his Harp”.  As people get sick in USA, trump will tweet, pence will pray, and people will die."
2020-02-28 16:07,"By turning this pandemic into a political issue the Trump administration demonstrates even further their incapability to handle this world wide problem. They refuse to see reality. Their view is totally incompatible with reality, undoubtedly to protect Trump who might be afraid that he will be blamed for causing the virus. Through his own ineptitude and arrogance and continued denial of the seriousness of the situation, he just might actually cause more damage. We are being led by delusional leadership: very frightening. The President first to protect and the populous is in danger. If this presidential behavior were a movie, it would be an absurdist political satire of the blackest humor."
2020-02-28 16:42,"The modern public relations crisis response method is to be transparent and allow your experts to talk about present and potential future conditions. That has nothing to do with politics, it's simply good practice. Doing the opposite, confusing the issue then appointing a non-credible non-scientist to vet information is what has caused the stock market (not part of the deep state and not run entirely by democrats) to respond."
2020-02-28 16:44,"Personally, I hope that this does hurt Trump and the Republicans.  The Democrats should point out the current administration’s efforts to eliminate Obamacare (they want the Supreme Court to delay their ruling until after the election so that their true intention to take away affordable and accessible health care with no good replacement plan developed would not hurt Trump’s re-election).

Similarly, the more moderate Democratic contenders (Biden and Bloomberg) should use this to hurt Bernie Sanders and his Medicare for all plan that eliminates all private insurance.  People will not want to lose their current guaranteed employer provided health insurance benefits in a time of fear and uncertainty in exchange for an unrealized and uncertain government program.  Since many are worried that a Sanders nomination will damage the Democrat’s chances in the upcoming elections, this could be very helpful in preventing that tragedy.

In other words, when life gives you lemons, make lemonade."
2020-02-28 16:42,"The Trump administration could hardly make more explicit its intention to mismanage this crisis. They are treating it not as a threat to the public interest, but as an occasion to attack and demonize their political opponents.  In other words, business as usual, with the difference now being that their conduct will directly lead to needless suffering and death.

The silver lining to this growing dark cloud may be that it becomes undeniable that Trump and the Republican party under his leadership represent a dire and ongoing threat to the public interest."
2020-02-28 16:23,"Enough is enough with the Trump Administration - putting stock market and partisan politics above the health of the nation.  Vote Blue in November 2020.  Enough is truly enough - and that's not ""fake news."""
2020-02-28 16:26,"for those of you confused about what it means to politicize a crisis, this is it actually looks like. unike after mass shootings (problem caused by political policy) or when the fed govt mishandles natural disaster (problem caused by political actors)."
2020-02-28 16:27,The media doesn't have to bring down Trump. He is doing a fine job of that by himself. Mulvaney and his errant comments about quid pro quos and US being desperate for more immigrants is doing a decent job as well.
2020-02-28 16:28,"The hypocrisy of this administration could prove fatal to the populace. When you disparage science and tear down every government scientific institution, these are the consequences - disarray in the face of a real problem. We need a coalition of democratic states to band together, share resources, and figure this out on our own. Coastal educated elites, unite!"
2020-02-28 16:29,"So, the coronavirus exists solo for use by the media to bring down trump? How precious. 

Meanwhile, there is a woman in California fighting for her life, who waited four days to be tested for coronavirus because the CDC wouldn't release the test. Now everyone she has come in contact with are vulnerable. 

Instead, the focus should be on Barron Trump's ""loving"" relationship with his father? How much longer can this country survive this nonsense?"
2020-02-28 16:30,"""I’m going to surround myself only with the best and most serious people""

How is that after 3 years and many, many thousands of falsehoods this administration still can't even tell the difference between optimistic spin and self-destructive panicky lies and embarrassing misdirection? Never mind executing a basic responsibility of government. 

Unfortunately viruses are immune to tweets, threats, lies, and finger pointing.  They can be fought by scientists and healthcare professionals such as the ones Trump fired despite being warned of the inevitably of an eventual pandemic.

If only there was a vaccine to protect us against incompetent leadership and irresponsible voters."
2020-02-28 16:32,Is it any wonder we are in the shape we're in with a guy like this acting as chief of staff?
2020-02-28 16:38,"How very Trumpian of Mr. Mulvaney, interpreting everything through the lens of what benefits or hurts his boss. I guess when one has an insecure ""acting"" position, Mr. Trump must be placated at all costs, even if that means making ridiculous utterances.

But for those of us inhabiting the real world, the view is different. This virus is spreading, and because we are now clear, thanks to the press conference a couple of nights ago, that this administration has no intention whatsoever of providing accurate information - even contradicting its own experts while those experts are standing next to the president - I for one am glad the media are doing their jobs.

Trump has zero credibility left. Even the stock market knows it, and the deepest drops are coming AFTER the disastrous presser Tuesday night. I wasn't worried about the virus until after I heard the president speak - and lie. And appoint Mike Pence to head up the government's response, which amounts to controlling the message.

Now I am worried. Media, keep doing your jobs. We need you."
2020-02-28 16:39,"I won’t mention “who” (though Mulvaney did).  

But “loving relationship” - for Trump -  seems most consistent with his adoration for himself.  

As far as his family goes, it seems he’s pretty good at ignoring them.  (Which is probably better than berating them - as he apparently does with his staff.)"
2020-02-28 16:40,"Come on Mulvaney, the world is highly concerned about the spread of this coronavirus and Trump is trying to minimize it. This seems very self-serving to say nothing to see here to try and prop up the stock market concern on the economic impact to prevent the spread of the virus.

I  recall a sharpee used to try and validate spreading hurricane fear in Alabama when there should have been none.

It is time for you and Trump to get over it and not make this political, which you seem to do every time a problem arises. I expect you will soon blame the democrats for the stock market correction. The only time the buck stops with Trump is when it goes to his hotels and resorts."
2020-02-28 16:33,"There is nothing more heartwarming to me than seeing all those photos of Mr. Trump on the links teaching Barron his beloved game of golf, or taking him to the World Series, or taking him to the Army-Navy game, or the national college football championship, or .... wait a minute - he didn't do any of those things.  ""Hey son, I got great tickets to the World Series - I'll be taking mom but I hope you enjoy watching it on TV with whoever watches you when we're away"".  Yeah, great dad indeed."
2020-02-28 16:15,"Media corporations as well as individual staffers (journalists, reporters, editors, et al) have a stake in the stock market.  Mulvaney is suggesting that media conglomerates are taking great pleasure in watching their own stocks plummet.  Mulvaney is suggesting that liberal voters are not negatively affected by this downturn.  Mulvaney is suggesting that this independent liberal voter is dancing in the streets while my retirement fund and children's college funds (I have a senior in high school) are being depleted.  The US needs leadership right now explaining how we are going to effectively combat the new coronavirus.  Instead, we have leadership that is denying that the virus is or will be a problem for Americans.  Tell me how US commerce will be protected during this time, and I'll happily increase investments.  Until I know the US is responding actively and wisely, I'll withhold further investments."
2020-02-28 16:24,"The Trump administration blames the media for politicizing a pandemic even as it subordinates CDC and HHS's responses and communications to it under its own appointed theocratic politician, Mike Pence. 

None of this will put a dent in the support of Trump's evangelical base, of course. If the spread of the virus is avoided in the US it will be a sign of god's approval of Trump/Pence. If it isn't avoided, it will be a sign of god's judgment laid at the feet the ""godless left"" for their mere existence or a Supreme Court decision to grant equal rights for the LGBTQ community or some other flimsy boogyman. Robert Jeffress, Jerry Falwell Jr and Franklin Graham will all go on Fox News and Twitter to shore of the ""values votes"" and the cycle continues."
2020-02-28 16:35,This is so disturbing that even this has become a partisan issue. What is this country coming to??? We are seriously coming apart at the seams.
2020-02-28 16:39,"“He said, ‘I’ve only got eight years, I’m going to get as much out of it as I can,’” Mr. Mulvaney said.

Every now and then, the truth is spoken accidentally.  Except for the eight years part, there is Trump's reveal.  He's out to get as much as he can."
2020-02-28 16:40,This interview will do nothing to increase the confidence in this administration's ability to handle the coronavirus outbreak and its spread. When will they learn?
2020-02-28 16:43,"trump told us that he alone can fix it - that was a while a ago, but he said it applied to everything

now he's using his traditional strategy - take credit for what's good and shift blame for what isn't

i guess that's why mike ""let's pray"" pence is in charge

this isn't a plot - it's lack of leadership. a president has to be presidential when there is a crisis and trump has said he doesn't have to be - people will like him for what he is. and so far, they have liked him.

why is the stock market down? lack of leadership - no confidence in what our government is doing to protect us and the nation

it's one thing for the president to lie about crowd size, but the out-and-out uniformed blather that trump is feeding us, mostly contrary to what ""experts"" say, is what has caused the panic. 

words don't make us feel better. actions can engender confidence. the only action is trump's jaw moving up and down. it's not enough."
2020-02-28 16:24,"All of the comments so far make good sense and confirm the weak ground on which M. Mulvaney's comments (as quoted) stand.
Viewed from over here in Europe, it's him, not the press, who are treating the virus reporting as a diversion from all the good things the Administration is doing. I'm not so troubled about the President's words about the situation; nothing surprises me anymore, but more worrying is the naked sycophancy surrounding him.
Meanwhile, other administrations are neither downplaying or over-egging the seriousness of the challenge posed by the virus."
2020-02-28 16:25,While millions of people are deeply worried about their lives this little bureaucrat is concerned about Trump's political issues.
2020-02-28 16:27,"If Trump shares a loving relationship with his youngest child, or ever expresses pride or fondness for him, wouldn't Fox News would be all over it?  

They certainly never bothered to cover Obama's affectionate relationship with his adored daughters - or, for that matter, any of the uplifting moments or sparkling events at the Obama white house that endeared that family, and that administration, to many of us.  

Seems to me that, were there similar heartwarming demonstrations of family values coming out of the Trump white house, beyond his admiration for the hotness of his wife or daughter, the conservative media would certainly be spinning it to manipulate public sentiment and pump up affection for their guy.  Maybe I've just missed it."
2020-02-28 16:32,"Here we are. Trump fired his Pandemic Response team in 2018. This likely contributed to the decision to allow health care workers to meet patients without personal protective equipment and then return to their communities. This, furthermore, is likely the source of at least one infection in CA. Trying to stem the Stock Market plunge, Trump then appoints the health expert, VP Pence, whose job appears to be to screen information from the CDC to the public. Now, through Mulvaney, we know that Trump would like the news media to stop covering the disease. Feeling safe, America?"
2020-02-28 16:32,"As expected, this administration cannot do simple math. This coronavirus has a much higher death rate (2.3%) vs. the flu (0.1%). Therefore, the potential to do much more harm if not contained.

And seriously, Mulvaney wants the press to focus on poor Barronn? So bizarre."
2020-02-28 16:38,"The coronavirus is the lead subject on French TV and radio news, as well as on political talk shows. I doubt vey much if the intent behind this constant coverage is to bring down the Trump presidency."
2020-02-28 16:39,"Give me a break, Mick. Another example of the paranoia that pervades the administration and the right wing in general. Almost all the coverage I've seen of the epidemic has been about China, with additional coverage of local outbreaks as appropriate. I haven't seen anyone suggest that Trump is responsible, although a case could be made for his budget cutting having an effect. Science will eventually save the day, a fact that won't ever be acknowledged by Trump and his minions."
2020-02-28 16:25,"2600 passengers boarded the Diamond Princess weeks ago---healthy enough to vacation. Now, FIVE are dead.

To put things in perspective:

- this does not happen with flu
- this does not happen with a norovirus
- this does not happen with accidents
- this does not happen on much bigger cruise ships
- this does not happen in month long cruises
- this does not happen on translantic cruises when everyone is cooped up.

There is no universe that I know of when 5 passengers die from an illness contracted on a ship."
2020-02-28 16:26,"There's a set of rules that Trump can reliably be counted on to adhere to, ""Always take credit, never accept responsibility"". Mulvaney is simply applying that to the situation."
2020-02-28 16:30,"If, as some agencies predict,  spread of the coronavirus touches 2/3 of the world's population, and with fatality rates of 1-2%, deaths in the US alone could reach 2-4 million, or roughly every person within a city the  size of St. Louis where I live.

Don't know about you, but that seems to me to be a catastrophe."
2020-02-28 16:31,"The Trump administration has a prime opportunity to demonstrate confidence in elected and non-elected officials, leadership, organization, and a measured approach to demonstrate to the public that they take this situation seriously and are doing everything possible to protect the public, and.....they fail on all accounts.  It's just whining and ""they're out to get us.""  Good lord help us all."
2020-02-28 16:32,"Mr. Mulvaney should be doing something to reassure the public in the face of panic on Wall Street and increasingly in the country at large.
Wasting precious time trying to blame the press and the opposition party is not doing the job Mr. Trump was elected to do.
This is the way the United States has been governed for three years now and it's plain to see the Emperor has no clothes."
2020-02-28 16:32,"This is another fine example of this administration's incompetence.  Instead of facing the hard truth of a health crisis, the President downplays the situation.  U.S. physicians do not even have the capacity to test a patient in a clinic who may potentially be infected unless they have known contacts with infected persons or have traveled to impacted countries.  The only other patients who can be tested must have life-threatening illness (in the ICU).  Where has the administration been for the last two months?  Across Europe, patients are readily tested.  However, as a physician in the U.S.  I do not have a test available to properly evaluate a patient for this disease."
2020-02-28 16:32,"Given that Trump has hinted he might not step down even after 8 years (on the basis that the Mueller investigation and impeachment ""robbed"" him of some of his presidency that he should get back at the end), is Mulvaney's statement at the end meant to console us that Trump would leave after all?"
2020-02-28 16:33,"Get a grip Mulvaney- it’s what Trump says, does, that causes the negative reactions. He does it to himself, over and over again. We did hear about the travel bans, we did hear he is trying to coordinate all virus info, good responses in ordinary circumstances. But due to his history of lies, of trying to hide politically damaging info, he again bungled his job- putting VP Pence in charge of info...instead of trusted medical people. Of allowing questionable people, without training, gear to interact with the returnees from China, the cruise ships. And by not standing up for this whistleblower, and instead downplaying their real concerns, he only makes it worse.

Are we delighted this may bring him down? No. But I for one cant understand how those Senate Repubs, all his conservative backers, his base- don’t get that time and time again he is using real problems as ad campaigns for him, while doing nothing to solve them, and here, making it worse.

Those vacant shipping ports aren’t caused by the media, by Dems; those disrupted supply lines aren’t a campaign to bring Trump down.  He’s supposed to be a leader. When, when, will he begin acting like one??"
2020-02-28 16:34,"I often find myself feeling sorry for people who work or have worked for President Trump, or cannot avoid coming into contact with him.

I myself would cross over to the other side of the street to avoid shaking hands with him.

But the coronavirus is an emergency … so for the time being, I’m willing to shake hands with him."
2020-02-28 16:43,"The stock market averages are plummeting precisely BECAUSE the White House has no idea how to plan and execute a strategy using SCIENCE to combat an impending epidemic.  That's the reason stock prices are falling, in a capitalist economy, when uncertainty and evidence of irresponsibility exist all over the landscape and particularly within the federal government."
2020-02-28 16:36,"We need to counter their selfishness with compassion and generosity. We need Medicare for all if we hope to deal with this virus and others that will come in the future. This administration feeds off of publicity, positive and negative, and loves conflict and scandal. Let’s not give it to them. Let’s use this as our launch to a more compassionate society!"
2020-02-28 16:52,"The international media is focusing very heavily on the spread of Covid-19 and the consequences.

In Italy, an important soccer match was just held with NO fan attendance.

Are those media outlets also covering the possible pandemic mainly as a way to diminish Trump? Mulvaney's implication that there is no other motivation for covering Covid-19 is preposterous."
2020-02-28 16:46,"I am a molecular virologist.  The White House's decision to filter and ""manage"" scientific and public health communication about an oncoming outbreak shows how desperate and chaotic this administration is.  It also shows that the Trump administration doesn't care actually about American health (surprise, surprise!).  Trump cares only about staving off a recession that will undo his main argument for reelection."
2020-02-28 16:32,"This is a ridiculous assertion but one making the rounds among conservatives.  Rush Limbaugh asserted the same and added that this is merely the common cold.  While the media is not reporting this crisis to bring down Trump, the media could consider with what perspective and balance it reports.  Reporting has been clearly on the side of what provokes fear. Is there no other side as well?"
2020-02-28 16:41,"As usual, the administration comes up with some ridiculous conspiracy perpetrated by the media or democrats.  They wonder why people panic?  Quit lying tell the truth the first time out and the results will be better.  Is there anyone in the current administration who can inform us as to the facts of a  situation?   We do not need to fear our enemies as we have an administration that emulates their tactics.  Lack of Barron coverage, impeachment, and other conspiracies ...really.  This is where they start eating their young."
2020-02-28 16:43,"Note to Mr. Mulvaney: ""The coronavirus mortality rate is running somewhere between 2 to 4%, and depending where you look and which population groups you’re in. The 1918 flu, which was the most devastating influenza in the history of our species, was less than 2%. So, this is already more lethal than the pandemic of 1918. Garden-variety, everyday flu, it’s about 0.1 to 0.01% fatal."" -- Laurie Garrett, former senior fellow for global health at the Council on Foreign Relations and a Pulitzer Prize-winning science writer, on Democracy Now, 2/27/20."
2020-02-28 16:48,"Oh dear. He really said that? There seems to be no end to the nonsense coming out of this administration. Smart people have long been worried that we could face a crisis while this woefully incompetent president is in office. Seems we are there now. Good luck, all."

It would be astonishing but it’s  just the norm for Trumpublicans."
2020-02-28 16:27,"Nobody should be listening to this political sycophant's opinions about this virus. The virus is not going to ask if you are a political conservative before infecting you. If Mulvaney was doing his job he would be back in the WH facilitating a smooth, rapid, ramped up public health response, updated based on what the scientists are telling him instead of whining about his press coverage. I could say more but I am still trying to find out where Mulvaney      ( and Pence, Kudlow etc ) went to medical school....."

2020-02-28 16:27,"Never mind the hundreds of thousands of Americans who are likely to die if a full throttle pandemic strikes America.

Trump and his group dismantled the infection protection and action that Obama developed after EBOLA

2020-02-28 16:55,"Trump's contempt for science makes him woefully unprepared deal with a public health crisis.  Trump's firing all of the government's experts on pandemics makes our government woefully unprepared to deal with  the corona virus outbreak. 

 Desperate to distract attention from his failings,  once again Trump and his GOP lackeys can do no more than criticize the media.  This is grossly irresponsible.  

 Appropriate response to a crisis demands a POTUS capable of thinking of situations in terms of more than how they impact his political fortunes.  We haven't had that for the last 3 years. 

 If we expect to do a better job with future health crises,  we need to defeat Trump in November."
2020-02-28 16:26,"This is bizarre. Does Mr Mulvaney only read US media? Has he not noticed that the press in all countries is reporting on the spread of this coronavirus? Is he not aware that the imminent threat of a global pandemic is unfortunately real? Does he not believe the updates from the World Health Organization? Does he not trust the US Centers for Disease Control?

Mr Mulvaney says 'This is not SARS, this is not MERS'. What does he mean? The name of this virus is 'SARS-CoV-2'. Like SARS-CoV and MERS it is a coronavirus that causes severe acute respiratory syndrome. So far we do not know precisely the fatality rate, nor the percentage that will become seriously ill. But even a small percentage of a large non-immune population becoming ill will result in shortages of hospital and ICU beds, health staff, medical equipment, and medicines. So far the virus has spread more quickly than SARS did. Is he not embarrassed to display his ignorance? Or is he trying to deceive the public for political reasons? 

The President, the Vice-President and all their Secretaries and advisers should by now be fully informed about the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic and have detailed plans in place to protect their population and mitigate the worst effects. And as a rich country, the US should be offering assistance to other countries - this is a global problem."

Stop making excuses and minimizing the threat of coronavirus to us all. 

Now."
2020-02-28 16:36,"This is just the most ill-informed, propagandistic take from Mulvaney.

The rate of morbidity among those infected with COVID-19 is 2% per 10,000 people. 

The rate of fatality of those infected with influenza is .1%.

This means that coronavirus, COVID-19, is 20 times more fatal than influenza among those infected with the virus.

This absolutely calls for a calm, strong, fact-based mobilization of government, public health and media resources in order to disseminate best practices to contain the virus.

Media have been doing this largely responsibility.

Trump, on the other hand, has been spreading misinformation--that it will disappear miraculously--based upon his usual technique of say everything so he can't be wrong.

He has muzzled Dr. Anthony Fauci, one of the most experienced experts in infectious diseases, and who has decades of expertise in guiding the nation through such crises.

He has meanwhile appointed Mike Pence--who stated that ""smoking doesn't kill"" as he took contributions from the tobacco industry, and ran a family owned network of cigarette and gas convenience stores called Tobacco Road.

Mulvaney: A sick, sad joke."
2020-02-28 16:46,"The Administration has already censured government scientists from reporting anything without prior permission from Pence.

In addition to this nonsense about a disease our country is now less armed to fight because of the Trump firing of fine health care professionals on the federal level.  Is that not enough? Well, here's Mulvaney also demanding the press cover the warm and fuzzy story of Trump ""frequently"" phoning his youngest son, Barron.  PHONING? He couldn't at least Skype?  Poor Barron; best thing that could happen to him would be a stint in the armed forces, where he might meet a range of people he will never otherwise be exposed to.  For that matter, two years of conscription would be just the thing for every member of the extended Trump family under the age of 50--and might be the only way to keep them out of jail."
2020-02-28 16:54,"Trump never is involved in Barron's care. Remember he had a press conference about vaping, and he said that Melania was involved because she has a son. He won't notice Barron until he is old enough to serve in one of Trump's companies or schemes."
2020-02-28 16:45,"Trump and his people seem to feel that the Corona PANDEMIC is about him.  It's not remotely about him, and for Mulvaney to say that anyone was using this fast-moving, world-wide health crisis to ""bring down the president"" is both ignorant and dangerous.  

Mr. Mulvaney, we DID read about the CDC activating its Emergency Operations Center to better provide ongoing support to the COVID-19 response on January 21st.  The administration imposed minimal travel restrictions  to take effect on February 2, ""suspending entry of foreign nationals who have been in China within the past 14 days"".  

Trump's impeachment trial did not prevent the press from covering this ongoing story, although Trump, tweeting constantly throughout his trial about the unfairness of it all, may not have been paying particular attention to the pandemic coming his way.  After the trial, Trump was consumed with revenge, firing the ""disloyal"" who dared to testify against him.

Mulvaney says that Trump did not sleep on his way home from India, nor during the day before his news conference.  I noticed that his Twitter account was very active, with Trump continuing his theme of martyrdom and the persecution of the press, Congressman Schiff, Leader Pelosi, the Democratic candidates, etc. Perhaps his lack of sleep is affecting him and causing his loyal staff to scurry to his defense.  The king is displeased."

America First denies the reality that a country can be first -  to the exclusion of all others - on this planet when 7 billion people breath the same air. Coronavirus teaches us America will never be alone. As it can never be alone; it can never be successful and free from disease without help from our next door neighbors 12 hours away."

2020-02-28 16:52,"Once again the President is a victim of the press, this time over critically reporting on the administration's response to COVID-19.

It's as if we are a flock of sheep with no shepherd and beset on all sides by ravening wolves. Oh, wait, that's exactly what is happening."
2020-02-28 16:54,"To say this is not related to SARS, MERS, Ebola, or H5N1 is simply flat out misinformed, or, purposely misinforming the public for whatever reason I do not know. I don’t know which scares me more. There are many reasons global health officials and epidemiologists are so rightfully concerned. The facts that the US has gutted our pandemic response capabilities (personnel, planning, supply chain, budget) and that this administration continues to downplay any risk at all; in fact actually causing to allow increased risk by bringing infected US citizens back to US with federal officials untrained in PPE, is further disregard for basic understanding of public health response (why administrations in the past relied on experts). I spent time on a statewide H5N1 Task Force. To continue to hear the drumbeat of denial rather than a cautious reiteration of how we as a country must face this, with seriousness, protocol education, and reduced fear is to have lost one our most significant tools in the fight, sober leadership. I would be surprised that this isn’t also moving the markets and amping up the fears that we are not just unprepared, we are truly leaderless."
2020-02-28 16:55,"""He said, ‘I’ve only got eight years, I’m going to get as much out of it as I can.'""

Once again, Mulvaney says the quiet part loud. Like any con man, Trump is certainly getting as much as he can, while he can. I just hope it's for half as long as he thinks."
2020-02-28 16:48,Here is what it looks like when delusional frenzy sets in. Imagine that the White House is upside-down with stocks plunging. Someone must realize that all the surgical masks are probably made in China -- could this be the start of a resurgent garment industry in the US?? I wish this wasn't happening.
2020-02-28 16:52,"Congress should enact a law that will cover the costs of any people going for tests for Coronavirus.  Having people faced with $3,700 bills for a blood test and a nose swab will discourage many people from getting tested.  There should be no barriers for those who need tests."
2020-02-28 16:53,"Here is how things look like from an outsider,from the UK 
The present administration is avowedly anti science and heavily capitalist. This has been working up till now. Little has hurt Trump’s chances of winning a second term and he is becoming more brazen in his tweets and actions with every onslaught. I believe that after all the crimes and scandals which have been brushed off, that Trump will be actually be brought down by the Coronavirus. But not by catching it. 
He does not realise this yet and his appointment of Mike Pence arguably shows that his thoughts are still dynastic. The Pences are seemingly lining up to run for the 2024 Presidency the moment Trump gets re-elected. As Trump will be wanting a shoe in for Ivanka or Don Junior, Mike Pence has to be set up to fail spectacularly and his appointment as the tsar in charge of the Coronavirus outbreak can only end badly. He has proven his antagonism and ignorance regarding anything scientific over many years. Everything done so far in the Californian internment centres shows that the federal health workers were unprotected despite their pleas for 21st century measures to contain the virus and to protect those quarantined, themselves and the wider community. 
These whistleblowers have been treated like the Chinese doctor who was arrested and threatened and the end results could be similar. By insisting that all health warnings and news must be run past Mike Pence for approval, the delays and obfuscation will cost lives."
2020-02-28 16:52,"If Trump actually did any of the right things this past week or over the past 2 months regarding Coronavirus, maybe his precious stock market wouldn't be falling because people might actually have confidence that the impact of the virus on America could be blunted by component leadership.  Instead, we have Trump and Pence muzzling our medical experts."
2020-02-28 17:07,"I still don't understand why the vast majority of Trump supporters would feel bolstered by a thriving stock market, since most of them, most Americans in fact, don't own any stocks. It reminds me of a sports fan cheering on their team as if they were participants, while the players themselves are earning a thousand times what they do."
2020-02-28 16:58,"At what point is any news, good or bad, all about the President and his minions?  Real world public health issues like this existed before this particular administration, and at those times the issues were addressed competently, not defensively, by the administrations in charge.  A little self-effacement and humility would do this President, administration, and the rest of us a world of good!"
2020-02-28 17:12,"The true scope of the Covid 19 virus in the US will reveal itself in the next few weeks whether the administration likes it or not. The potential effects are mind-boggling and I fear Nero will tweet while Rome burns. HOWEVER.....

.... what the administration should be truly terrified about is the number of Americans who have poor or no health insurance because Coronavirus apparently spreads fast and very easily with many of its victims being asymptomatic or only mildly ill.  Those without insurance or whose crappy health insurance has a $2000+ deductible aren't going anywhere near a doctor unless they are in dire straits. 

This puppy could spread like wildfire because our healthcare system is not designed to handle an epidemic like this."

2020-02-28 16:58,"Pence to coordinate the administration’s spin on Coronavirus. Always glad to see Trump reaching  for the most qualified in the field to head up the team. I’m sure Pence has impeccable credentials in the field of epidemiology or some related discipline.  Or, instead, his politically oriented mind can “pray on it” before he disseminates the Trump administration’s official line. I think it’s a stroke of genius to silence the career professions at the CDC, etc from talking without going through Pence.  I’m sure those guys never in their lifetimes had situations that called for a carefully worded statement that was absolutely  factual, but constructed to avoid unnecessary panic. Trump and Pence obviously know better!!  

I hope the god that Pence prays to sees fit to help us all!"

2020-02-28 17:05,"It's been said many times over the past few years here and in other papers, tragically and cynically but with a ring of truth that when money and lives are truly lost, it may be the only occasion for the cult-like regime and its followers leading the nation for their feverish devotion to finally break. And reality and truth to resurface. With very mixed emotions, this may be that time."
2020-02-28 17:09,"Trump has used fear and exaggeration throughout much of his presidency & campaign.  Trump's use of fear - fear of a black president in place of a white male, fear of females taking control, fear of immigrants, fear of guns being taken away etc. etc. etc..  Trump's administration has never played down those fears Mr. Mulvaney and continue to politicize them."

2020-02-28 17:10,"In a rational universe, the president who continued to propose deep cuts to the CDC budget, even in the face of a pandemic, would be universally reviled.
What's more, a president who valued slavish loyalty and blind partisanship over basic competence would be shown the door the moment all those idiocrats begin running around like chickens with their heads cut off.
One, sad silver lining. When the economic ship flounders - as seems to be happening in response to Covid-19 - the fair weather Trump voters will abandon him, clutching their pocketbooks."
2020-02-28 17:11,"Regarding this pervasive climate of ‘fear’.....

At this point it’s quite evident  that really the only thing the US and the world needs to FEAR right now is the ‘presidential’ tyro Trump himself together with his loyalist troopers. Quite reasonable as just maybe few bumble-fumble sentences and the US and the world just could die."
2020-02-28 17:00,The only thing bringing down Trump is Trump. This Administration's reliance on pseudo-science and voodoo economics is all you need to know about what is going on here.

The GOP has said for decades that government is the problem, and the less of it the better. Americans today approve of Trump and his tax cuts for the rich, and paying for it by cutting ""services"" like CDC.  Trump's approval rates are rising, and getting rid of useless government is a big reason why. and the reason people will keep voting GOP to keep the Senate and retake the House, to Make America Great Again."
2020-02-28 16:56,"Despite the paranoid worldview of the hyperpartisan Mulvaney, we ARE poorly prepared (the admin has been on a years long gutting of emergency services’ budget and personnel ) and the fed has LITTLE ammo to stimulate the economy with lower rates. The fact-hating ideologues in this Admin are making matter worse.

The media is doing saturation coverage, yes, but they have done so since the very beginning when this was limited to China and had nothing to do with Trump. And the media did indeed cover the President’s declaration and banning people from nations with the virus. Also for all their sensationalizing, has run many pieces about hand-washing and other time-tested preventative practices.  When he is not lying, Mulvaney cherry picks.

It is natural for an oversold market to react strongly to the news of the spread of the virus. We have seen disruptions to supply chains, travel and hospitality, decreased demand for energy, a likely falloff in public dining, attendance at sporting events, night clubs, shopping centers. We are likely entering the “capitulation stage” where hold outs fold their hands and sell.  Buyers will return.

That many people seem to get this virus and survive just fine is much needed positive news."
2020-02-28 16:57,"Right, the media is focused on taking down Trump, instead of informing the public about an imminent public health risk...

2020-02-28 17:10,"Mulvaney is correct it seems to me. The media’s coverage of this “crisis” has bordered on panic-stricken and a prominent leitmotif in the coverage is that if even one American gets sick then that will be the fault of the administration.  

For what it’s worth, i’m buying more stocks, because the market is going to come roaring back. I will also go out on a limb and predict that we in the United States will experience only a small number of coronavirus cases.￼ 

Unlike China, we are NOT a third world country."
2020-02-28 17:11,"This is why wiser presidents didn't take credit for market upturns.  They knew trends could reverse at any time.  If you take the credit, you get the blame as well.  Don't blame the media, Trump fans."

His name is Donald Trump.

There isn't a Democrat out there that could possibly equal what Donald Trump is doing (and not doing) to bring himself down.

Mike Bloomberg couldn't do this to Donald Trump if he spent all 60 billion of his fortune on the attempt.

I think the Democrats should step back and let Donald Trump and his cult followers finish the job of political suicide they're committing on themselves.

Donald Trump, the 21st-century version of Herbert Hoover."

No, the press is not out to ""get"" Trump, although the way he does his job certainly leaves him open to fair criticism.

And Mr. Mulvaney, shouldn't you he back at the White House during the initial stages of a possible pandemic instead of giving speeches to Trump loyalists?"
2020-02-28 17:09,"I strongly encourage anyone reading the Times to find the State Department website, the WHO website, get on their own State's Health alert system, and avail themselves of other news input to remain informed, not panicked but informed and basically prepared for a potential disruption, small or big.  Prevention is what  is being pushed now and for a big reason.  Up your thorough hand washing, consider shaving beard, other facial hair, be mindful of how you sneeze (tissue or into bent elbow).  Get a tube of alcohol/bleach wipes especially if you run a business with a counter or something where the general public rests themselves or their stuff or within your home on surfaces family members touch a  lot."

2020-02-28 16:57,"Why are financial markets falling all over the world? The coronavirus is not unique to the a United States or to Trump's fragile ego. As this virus spreads around the planet this must mean the world wants to take Trump down.

So, yes, let's talk about Trump's warm relationship with Barron, that'll make us all feel better."
2020-02-28 17:00,"“He said, ‘I’ve only got eight years, I’m going to get as much out of it as I can,’” Mr. Mulvaney said.

If Trump stayed up on the plane home because he was worried, it wasn't over concern about the welfare of Americans other than himself.

Of course almost all sane, thoughtful Americans hope the virus crisis will bring down Trump.  He continues to destroy our Republic bit by bit.  Mick Mulvaney is just parroting the same thing all members of Trump's cabinet do - praise Trump in order to keep the jobs they have.  Trying to earn anywhere near the same amount of money and publicity in any other job would not be possible for them."
2020-02-28 17:02,"There is  potential for real, tangible, measureable mortality from this virus. More Americans will become sick and the disease will continue to spread. This administration is interested in only one thing: branding and rebranding. Of course Trump is not responsible for Covid-19, but he is absolutely accountable for his carelessly casual response to the imminent outbreak here in the US. He should be held to account for the staff reductions in the very governmental agencies tasked to help in just such situations. God willing, hospitals, medical researchers and epidemiologists will soon have accurate tests available, CDC modeling for proactive response, a public observant of precautions. 
When tragedy strikes, count on a Trump to turn tail and run while aggressively stabbing a stubby finger of blame at anyone and everyone else."
2020-02-28 17:04,"Hey Mr. Mulvaney - here is some news for you.  The morbidity rate of the common flu is about .1 to .5% depending on the severity of the season.  So far experts have indicated the morbidity rate for this virus is 2-3% - which is in line with the pandemic of 1918.    This virus has many knowns, including how it is transmitted, whether people can become re-infected, etc.  The press is correct in covering the Administration's lack of planning.  This morning it was reported the CDC had only 200 test kits on hand, although they are getting more.  Mr. Trump's response was ""well, you probably won't die"" - not exactly comments to inspire confidence.   The Administration eliminated the entire pandemic response team - something I suspect you supported given your animosity toward government workers.  And as pointed our, Mrs. Trump does not want the media to cover her son and they have respected that.   You and the Administration's constant lying is responsible for the healthy skepticism the press and many in the public are expressing regarding the response to this crises.  You have only yourselves to blame."
2020-02-28 17:05,I simply want competent leadership and qualified scientists in charge of U.S. response efforts in cooperation with other countries. Is that too much to ask for? Apparently so.
2020-02-28 17:14,"Trump's spin doctors are protecting Trump, not the public health of Americans (which, of course, is related to global public health).   Instead of keeping laser focus on what needs to be done to address the spread of coronavirus in a mature way, Trump and his camp are rage-tweeting, downplaying the seriousness (""it's just a cold""), blaming the media and everyone else for their slow and incoherent response to a looming health crisis, and artificially pumping up the stock market like a cheerleader.   Total lack of leadership."
2020-02-28 17:01,"Perhaps it will finally take a pandemic for some people to realize we need healthcare for everyone in this country.
People with no health insurance are always the last to get tested for disease or to seek treatment or to take preventative measures such as vaccines, etc.
This will translate into more widespread community transmission of Coronavirus or any other communicable disease.
Perhaps when this disease starts having serious effects on red states, it may sink in that healthcare for everyone is in everyone's best interest."
2020-02-28 17:08,"While I agree with protecting the children of Presidents from excessive media coverage, I never see the Trump's going out for a date night, getting a first family dog, or participating in Easter celebrations or healthy eating events in the same way we saw the Obama family and children.  As an elementary teacher, I don't think calling your son often cuts it.  President Trump plays more rounds of golf than any other President in history.  Trump's lack of a family life is either due to a lack of media coverage or the fact that he doesn't have a family life.  If it is the later, this may explain a lot about the President's lack of stability and decorum."
2020-02-28 16:56,"Why is commerce always more important than people for politicians? The US and the world could have and should have done more to stop the spread of the coronavirus.  Strict limitations on travel three weeks ago would have been more effective.

2020-02-28 17:04,"Testing Capacity
Beyond the federal guidance for whose eligible to receive testing, epidemiologists and public health officials have raised questions about the U.S. capacity to conduct tests amid a potential epidemic in the U.S. Despite monitoring more than 8,400 individuals, the state of California only has “a few hundred testing kits,” Newsom said Thursday.

“That’s simply inadequate to do justice to the kind of testing that is required to address this issue head on,” Newsom said."
2020-02-28 17:07,"Almost as troubling as the characteristics of this virus is the recent news that there will be a strict constraint on information released by the Administration to the public. Presumably this will  
be enforced by those two noted experts, Donald Trump and Mike Pence. Despite all of Trump's efforts to eliminate unbiased science, we still have true experts; as they are muzzled by Trump we will have no one left who actually understands the situation and is willing to tell us the truth. This will soon be obvious to all, and will be a source of confusion and conceivably even panic. Just what we need as we struggle to  assess and deal with the situation."
2020-02-28 17:36,"With the cancellation of many sporting events and guidance to avoid large congregations of people (initially in countries like China, Japan, S.Korea), one would think that the gigantic petri dish of international organizations and gatherings of officials and politicians around the world would inevitably lead to accelerating transmission of the coronavirus.

In fact Washington DC is crammed with people who regularly travel and mingle at such official venues. They’re not even tested or monitored after attending such events.  Events like gatherings in India of 100,000 people in a cricket stadium, or standing admiringly up close and personal to the surface of the Taj Mahal."
2020-02-28 17:39,"Whenever Trump is in trouble, which is continually, enablers and apologists like Mulvaney always say:

2020-02-28 17:36,I'll boil this down. The president considers his reelection more important than the health of the American people. And other peoples as well.
2020-02-28 17:36,Mulvaney complains that Trump wasn't given enough credit for travel restrictions.  Perhaps that's because it's 2020 and travel restrictions are an inadequate answer.  Pandemics require a whole-of-government approach that includes cooperation and engagement between nations.
2020-02-28 17:47,Regarding trump’s relationship with Baron I can’t imagine him asking Baron to toss a softball back and forth. Or bring it up to modern time and play a computer game with Baron. It’s never going to happen. I feel sorry for kid in that father son relationship.

Good scientific information about the nature and extent of the crisis and what steps we can do to prevent it are needed.  The problem is that many feel we cannot trust Trump and his anti-science minions to give us the facts.   Mick Mulvany's whining about the media only makes it worse.  it certainly does nothing to make me trust my government any more."
2020-02-28 17:32,"As of this morning at 11, the only people that could be screened for the coronavirus are the ones with a link to mainland China. The health professional we talked to was frustated about it, but there was nothing she could do. So if you have a cold, have traveled in Europe and met people just arrived from Italy, there is nothing they can do but tell you to rest and have lots of fluids. If I compare with France and Italy, the American government does not seem to be acting very fast. France took measures to protect people from pay loss if they have to self-quarantine and to give first day pay compensation to those who are on sick leave due to the virus. 
I have just heard on the French radio that specialists think the virus has been present in Italy for weeks. It's more than probable that it is already here too, and only a sudden multiplication of severe cases will warn us of its presence, as happened in other countries. I am disappointed in the CDC after long considering it as one of those truly great American things, the once beacon of medicine seems to be casting a dim light."

2020-02-28 16:48,Trump manipulated market via insider trading for him and his friends with fiasco of tariffs on China and excessive subsidies to farmers while cutting back on public health care and preparing emergencies. Now market is out of his control and he tries to blame media and Democrats even for remarks in a debate after stock declines. He now has to hope China can recover economic growth soon and we dodge bullet on virus given incompetence  of those in charge  especially Pence.  I do hope Barron got his flu shot.
2020-02-28 16:53,"OMG, it is just like middle school, where the popular girl thinks ""they shortened the lunch hour so I can't mingle with my many friends!"".  Me me me.  What a sad state our government is in, and what a scary moment to be alive.  I fear for us all."

Never mind how the sick are dying and suffering, never mind how to care for them, but let’s talk about how much attention he gives to Barron! Even if Melania didn’t ask the media for privacy, Trump’s relationship with his son is not news worthy compared to everything else that happens in the world. It’s going to be a repeat of Puerto Rico where he was throwing paper towels to hurricane victims, but this time he’ll throw hand sanitizers to dying patients, then demand the media say what a great job he’s doing to help the sick."

2020-02-28 16:59,"Other than suing the NYT, there must be someone in the current administration who is reading the NYT that must be reading every article and comment, and followed articles, and in this instance, about the virus in question that the Times reported, so as usual, the administration lied yet again. 
 
Watching Trump's news conferences was painful and laughable as he ""listened"" to the experts explain the possible ramifications of the virus on the world and American populations.  He was lost in his own world and not digesting any of it, maybe because he didn't want to, or he didn't understand any of it.  At times he even seemed annoyed that he was contradicted although I can't even recall at which point he even made any kind of sense. 

Trump is simply living in another world, if he spews his nonsense often enough, removes the experts from the media so that those who have limited access to, or refuse to read legitimate newspapers such as the Times, or just listen to antagonizing news stations that hosts the likes of Mulvaney, many will only see that there is nothing to be concerned about, that the government is in full control, and there is nothing to see here, and conclude that we don't really need experts now, do we?

Our only hope for the general public could be commercial stations that report the news.  Perhaps they could allow some scientific proof to emerge and bring in the public health experts to speak freely so that everyone will be aware of health hazards and Trump stump."
2020-02-28 17:00,"Modern governments provide candor, unity, prudence, prevention, science, prioritization and resources. 

Autocrats provide pander, spin, finger-pointing, division, sneers, cavalier amateurism, lethargy, superstition, stasis, and greed. Guess which rules the USA."
2020-02-28 17:10,Maybe they should just get used to the fact that we still have a free press in this country.
2020-02-28 17:13,"Again, the silence from the GOP is deafening. They continue to allow this freak show of an administration to bulldoze ahead with only contempt for the American public and the objective of promoting/protecting Trump, who continues to shoot himself in the foot at every opportunity. These comments by Mulvaney are ridiculous at best, but also evil in intent. The only truth is the reported comment from Trump in which he says he's ""going to get as much"" out of his time in office as he can. That's been the plan all along."
2020-02-28 16:26,"Correction, he has only a little more than eight more months before he's voted out of office."
2020-02-28 17:06,"Trump doesn’t need the help to fail at anything. 

At failing. Trump is an expert."
2020-02-28 17:06,"By requiring that all Federal comments about COVID-19 be ""approved"" by Mike Pence, the White House has turned this epidemic into a political mess.  Mulvaney is totally projecting his own errors. Americans want facts, we want data. Give the job to the head of the CDC, don't give it to the second-least-trusted person in the administration."
2020-02-28 17:09,"These people have always been around, though just a generation ago they were found in tar-paper shacks at the edge of town--biker bars and cockfights and holy-roller revivals.
Now, without ever reading a book, they're lecturing us on virology and climate change and ethics...
Trump is a foul and stunted man, for sure, but he may well be a mirror of what this country has become."
2020-02-28 17:09,Mulvaney is not interested in Barron Trump's well-being or the efforts of Barron's mother to protect him from the press. What Mulvaney does want is for BT to be a prop for an attempt at image repair of Mulvaney's flawed hero.
2020-02-28 17:19,"Instead of leadership and professionalism from White House and staff in a time of crisis, we get this? Is the media supposed to cover Trump's youngest child because ""he's huge?"" Are we seriously supposed to believe Trump has stopped sleeping because he needs to get as much as he can out of his time as president? Life as an American in the age of Trump just jets more bizarre, and scarier by the day."
2020-02-28 17:26,"The commenters have done an excellent job describing Trump's posturing and his management style.  That his handling of the coronavirus is in lock step with Trump's style of governing i.e., pathologically  self-centered. I have quickly learned that when Trump says something, it usually is a self-serving lie.  

I  wish to comment on what Mulvaney said about Barron, and how ridiculous his words were on the face of it.  i see his youngest son infrequently, most often when he gets off the Air Force One for a trip to his family home in Florida.  i remember Sasha and Malia, growing up before our eyes, seeing them at musicals , concerts, at basketball games, on vacations and out for dinner with their parents.  Michelle and the President Obama, fully engaged parents, decided early on that most every evening was spent having dinner with their children.  There were no trumpets blaring, there was no  Acting White House Chief of Staff rebuking the media for neglecting to mention what good parents the Obamas were.   Melania made it abundantly clear the press leave her son alone.  The press has a heck of a hard time covering this White house.  How tiring is this administration?"
2020-02-28 17:04,"Does Mr. Mulvaney think that the financial markets hate Trump? How else can he explain this massive sell-off by professional financial experts? It just shows how absurd the entire Trump administration is, believing that it can “message”it’s way out of everything, and if that fails, blaming someone else. It also shows that if you have a President who has  spent three years providing “alternative facts,” people simply stop believing you."
2020-02-28 17:04,"I agree with Mulvaney, the liberal mainstream has never been a friend to the President, so this is nothing new. Just the same old same old. But Trump triumphs despite their disdain. MAGA!"
2020-02-28 17:19,"What is coming in the next couple months is going to be scary and in our face.We know that over half the country live paycheck to paycheck and don't have $400 against a real emergency.Now you put the $3270 price tag on the test for coranvirus and sky high deductible for most insurance and you now have a societal collapse marching right at you! How many people do you think will go to the hospital as they get the first symptoms knowing it represents a financial disaster that may take many years to dig out of.So they will stay away in droves which will be sure to spread this to the entire Herd.Statistics from China say over 2% DIE.Now multiply that times 300 million in U S and you have a whole lot of dead people, people in already dire straits financially and it sounds like a collapse of life in America.It may also be just what we need to break this system of Predatory Healthcare and get single Payer system minus profit motive which is a Scourge. Many of us are going to die and be financially destitute so get ready!"
2020-02-28 17:10,Truth threatens Trump and his supporters. Nothing is more scary to them.
2020-02-28 17:23,Trump is doing a fine job of bringing himself down. He doesn't need help form the media. The reality is years of lies and distortions on a grammar school level have finally caught up with him and the result was a VOTE OF NO CONFIDENCE..from the stock market.
2020-02-28 17:27,"No, the Coronavirus, even if it becomes a serious crisis will not bring down the President as Mulvaney claims and he is playing politics in a highly irresponsible fashion.
This is not the moment to be concern with politics or to blame the news media for trying to inform the public on a very dangerous and present threat.
This is the moment to use every expertise we have to educate the public to prevent the virus from spreading. IT IS NOT THE MOMENT TO SUPPRESS THE EXPERTS from speaking to the public as this Administration is doing and also name a person without any expertise in medical and Pandemic  issues as the head of the organization in charge of coordinating this fight.
Playing politics will seriously hurt the american people."
2020-02-28 17:28,"Why not have specialists and scientists  giving regular reports?  No instead we get Mulvaney, Limbaugh, Huckabee and Cruz.  We deserve better than worshipers. These people are just propaganda for Trump."
2020-02-28 17:31,Expect Mr. Mulvaney to be looking for new employment the moment Melania reads this interview transcript.
2020-02-28 17:19,"Sorry, Mr. Mulvaney. This virus should be the President's ONLY priority as of now. If the death rate is indeed 2%, that means 6,000,000 Americans could die. 9/11 ""only"" killed 3,000 people. Now we're looking at the potential of 9/11 magnified 2000x. I may not like the President, but I want him to succeed in this, as I don't want to see my friends, family and neighbors get sick or possibly perish. Making this all about the President and his treatment (or not) by the media is a pointless distraction. Lives are on the line. Yours included. Start acting like it."
2020-02-28 17:21,"I love howTrump & Co are all in on downplaying the virus. Do they realize the size of the political risks they're running?

I'm not an epidemiologist, I can't predict the impact of the virus. And I can't make the virus more deadly by rooting for it.

But I can see what's happening.

If the virus becomes a big problem in the US Trump is toast. I'm not saying I wouldn't be happy at that outcome. But I'm old enough that catching it might be the end of me. So I'm not actually rooting for it. Which wouldn't matter anyway.

The virus really doesn't care how we feel about it."
2020-02-28 17:23,"So, I'm wondering how ""The Media"" enlisted Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe into the conspiracy to ""take down"" Trump, given that the coronavirus isn't such a big deal. Who made him to close the schools? Trump says they have a good relationship. Maybe Mulvaney is part of it, saying patently ridiculous things to make the administration look bad. Limbaugh should look into that."
2020-02-28 17:24,"Every person around Trump was hired for their ideology, part of which was a belief in Trump rather than science.  That works fine when there's no crisis and credibility is not needed.  Now they're panicking because suddenly no one believes them.  They thought they could double down forever but their luck ran out and they have no contingency plan."
2020-02-28 17:19,"I remember George W. Bush's lame response at Ground Zero after 9/11 (4 days after the fact), and people bought it.  Same with his response, and the republicans in general, after Katrina.  And after Iraq turned into a debacle.  And after the Great Recession of '08.  Modern day, we can't even keep track of the missteps and crimes of the current administration.  The conservative portion of America will swallow anything their Great Leaders happen to put out there, as long as it blames Democrats, Liberals, The Media, Brown People, or whoever's handy.  It works for them, I don't understand why, but they thrive on it."
2020-02-28 17:21,Times like this make me wish for an Obama administration which created the pandemic response unit which Trump gutted. Everything Trump does just seems to make Obama's achievements that much more resounding and further enhances his legacy as one of the greatest presidents we have ever had the good fortune to have. Which is exactly the opposite of what trump has tried to do from the start. Now our lives are at stake due to the pandemic of incompetence of this white house.
2020-02-28 17:23,"The president's own words and actions, reported without comment, save for maybe fact checking would be sufficient to bring him down. It just so happens that he is buoyed by an army of sycophants who have cowed the already craven GOP senate delegation into subservience. Like most things in his life, he is saved from his utter incompetence and faces no repercussions. But maybe a pandemic that particularly effects his older, poorer core supporters who shun things like modern medicine and funding healthcare will finally rattle them."
2020-02-28 17:26,"The republican party has been a curse on the United states all through our modern history.

The republican party was in charge in the long lead up to the great depression.

When FDR steadied the country, the republican [party fought him at every turn, they fought the passing of social security as though their lives were on the line, republican supreme court justices held it up, Social security is one of the great things about our nation, where would many seniors be without it

The republican party was on office during the 2008 crises

The republican party sent us to war in Iraq, lying about weapons of mass destruction, costing the lives of many US soldiers, and spent trillions which escalated the national debt.

they were the party in power during the saving and loans crises

They fought Obamacare with all they had, and would have in fact repealed, making million lose their health insurance but John McCain stopped them.

And now this. What will it take at long last for that segment of the American people who continue to support these people, to finally wake up and see what kind of danger they really are.

The corona virus is an imminent threat to our safety but sometimes good thing come out of bad.

If Donald Trump is thrown out of office, if all the senators and congressmen who blindly follow him are thrown out, if republican voters are forced by hard times to finally forced to see the light than this will definitely be a case where good came out of bad."
2020-02-28 17:19,Who cares about Barron Trump or what his relationship to his father is? The only people that should be concerned about it are the members of the Trump family. It's a private issue. Mulvaney and Trump are rooting around for soft news coverage to soothe the exploding heads of the Trumpists who are losing big time in the stock market.
2020-02-28 17:26,Epidemiologists in the United States are speaking out as the government has been all but silenced by Trump.  They care about the public and are willing to play Cassandra to the country as Republicans  are more interested in money than their lives.
2020-02-28 17:28,"Good grief, this is carrying shameful toadyism beyond previously seen depths.   Does Mulvaney really think this is effective beyond the small number of faithful who seem to have an unnaturally high tolerance for acceptance of the unacceptable?

“The flu kills people,” he said. “This is not Ebola. It’s not SARS, it’s not MERS. It’s not a death sentence, it’s not the same as the Ebola crisis.”  
Mr. Mulvaney tells us, believe him at your own risk, I will listen to the scientists who are experts in epidemiology and medical people on the front lines.

Yes, it is killing people while crippling everyday life where it has been able to spread.   I am fearful for those without health insurance and are low income.  Trump must answer for all the damage he and his party are causing to American security.

Anyone who thinks there are certain Democrats they cannot vote for (I’m thinking of you, David Brooks), will bear some of the responsibility.   I just hope we can hold on until the next inauguration and we have a president with a Congress and Senate she can work with."
2020-02-28 17:22,"My Trump supporting dad and brother were worried about the virus and started stockpiling food and ammo (I know how absurd that sounds) last month. They were so worried, they asked me to move back to their rural home in another state. I told them no thanks; I have a proper emergency kit with food etc. for earthquakes. (No ammo, ha.)   

I'm curious to see if Mulvaney's story will change how they view this perceived threat."
2020-02-28 17:24,"Dr. Anthony Fauci, Director National Institutes of Allergy and Infectious Diseases has worked through several administrations from the Reagan presidency to the Trump presidency and is the key part of the Trump administration Corona virus team and along with the head of CDC Dr. Redfield, I am quite confident that the US Government has placed the fight against Corona virus in good hands. I have met both and I think they are the best in the country. As an ex head of a Division of Medical Virology and an ex Director of an Influenza center, I am quite confident that if the current trend continues with Corona cases diminishing in China and the world having awakened to the need to take all possible measures, I am optimistic that Corona virus will be history.

All attempts to politicize the potential Corona virus pandemic and to weaponize the unfortunate situation will result in a disaster for the politicians and reporters favoring those politicians. I have already given 10 reasons why I am not scared or panicking about the Corona viruses. The foremost being that 98% of the people infected have not died so far and no resident in the USA has died so far."
2020-02-28 17:18,"""The media’s focus switched to the coronavirus for the same reason, he continued.
“The reason you’re seeing so much attention to it today is that they think this is going to be the thing that brings down the president,” he added. “That’s what this is all about it.”""

Right. If Hilary was in the White House today, the press wouldn't bother with even mentioning the new disease was spreading to now more than 45 countries, and that it is having effects on economies already.

Here's some information Mulvaney might want to review while he tries to drag Trump's youngest child out as a distraction.

""As of February 23, 2020, there were 76,936 reported cases in mainland China and 1,875 cases in locations outside mainland China. There have been 2,462 associated deaths worldwide; no deaths have been reported in the United States. Fourteen cases have been diagnosed in the United States, and an additional 39 cases have occurred among repatriated persons from high-risk settings, for a current total of 53 cases within the United States.""

So we're OK so far, but the fatality rate among all reported cases is 3.2%.  This is not the flu.

That quote above is from the CDC page: Update: Public Health Response to the Coronavirus Disease 2019 Outbreak — United States, February 24, 2020

<a href=""https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/69/wr/mm6908e1.htm"" target=""_blank"">https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/69/wr/mm6908e1.htm</a>"
2020-02-28 15:44,"Mulvaney's entire rant is absurd.  

Baron Trump is off limits...so why isn't the press covering the father/son relationship?

The media is exagerating the coronavirus story...so why weren't they writing more about it in January?  

A performance to be viewed by one person.  Well done, Mr. Mulvaney.  Your job should be secure for at least the next week."
2020-02-28 16:05,"2%-3% of the US population is between 6,600,000 and 9,900,000 people.  No biggie."
2020-02-28 16:11,"When did so many severe forms of psychiatric illness become communicable? Perhaps Mulvaney should start wearing a surgical mask when wandering around the White House to avoid being infected by even more of the President's obvious insanity, and seek urgent-care treatment for the ailments already passed along."
2020-02-28 16:28,"So China downplayed the extent of the spread of the virus, vilified those who raised the alarm, censored the press who spoke of its spread and suppressed citizen reporting of the systemic failures that appeared during it spread.  Oh, wait, that is the Trump playbook too.  At least China focused its collective might on containing the virus and did not go whistling past the graveyard.  Take note Mike."
2020-02-28 16:32,Most fathers have loving relationships with their sons. Why should this be news about Trump? The fact that Mulvaney complains of no coverage shows how desperate the White House is for something positive to spin. How embarrassing.
2020-02-28 16:54,This epidemic has similar characteristics to the flu pandemic of 1918 and it is spreading fast. Does Mulvaney really think the press shouldn't be covering this? If this isn't news I don't know what is. But this is a typically ridiculous response from a ridiculous administration.
2020-02-28 17:05,"In the screaming moral vacuum that is this administration, there’s absolutely nothing they  won’t use to serve their own cruelty and trump’s monstrous self-pity."
2020-02-28 17:14,"You have to wonder - IF this virus really takes hold in the US, infects hundreds of thousands and kills thousands, at what point will Trump supporters realize most mainstream news coverage IS NOT a conspiracy theory deep state hoax perpetuated by the media? If Trumpers start dropping dead, who will they blame then? Hillary?"
2020-02-28 17:14,"Who do we think is better equipped to speak for the U.S. government and coordinate what is said about the coronavirus? Is it Vice President Mike Pence - who has been told to clamp down on and control all D.C. communications and scientific knowledge funneled to a frightened public.  Or someone like Dr. Anthony Fauci.

Pence has worked for the federal government for the blink of an eye. Before that, he was a nearly crackpot conservative governor of Indiana. And he fears even dining alone with any woman, even professional, without his wife's presence.

Anthony Fauci, M.D. has worked for and consulted numerous presidents of both parties and given more then 35 years leading the causes of public health and infectious disease, including HIV/AIDS since before the virus had a name. Fauci has been a crime-fighting cop against Ebola, Zika, TB, malaria and other murderous microbes, and received dozens of honorary doctoral degrees and received big-time awards from the U.S. and abroad.

Mike Pence does and says, precisely and exclusively, what Trump tells him to, and not one iota more. Fauci follows the dictates of scientific research and human health. Pence works for table scraps while Fauci commands a budget of about $5.9 billion.

You tell me who's better. Or better yet, tell Donald Trump."
2020-02-28 17:17,"Is there no small child in or near the White House available to say ""The Emperor has no clothes""?"
2020-02-28 17:43,"So China did all of this just to get at Trump?  They shutdown a city of 50 million to get Trump?  Japan has closed schools and is concerned about the Olympics to get Trump?  Italy is after Trump?  I guess when you are a narcissist, even pandemics are about him."
2020-02-28 16:31,"“He said, ‘I’ve only got eight years, I’m going to get as much out of it as I can’”

Many a true word is spoken in propaganda.  The fact that Mulvaney is oblivious to the fact that the ""fake news"" has been saying the same for a long time speaks volumes."
2020-02-28 16:28,"Mulvaney criticizes the media for not covering Mr. Trump’s son Barron,  I criticize it for still covering anything Mulvaney says at this point."
2020-02-28 16:48,"“He said, ‘I’ve only got eight years, I’m going to get as much out of it as I can,’” Mr. Mulvaney said.

I can only assume Mulvaney means Trump wants to get as much out of the grift as he can."
2020-02-28 16:49,Let’s hope for Trump and Mulvaney’s sake that the virus is contained to blue states. But even then they’ll find a way to blame Obama for it. This is what happens when you have an incompetent administration in the grip of an anti-government and anti-science ideology. They must deny reality.
2020-02-28 15:49,"When will this administration finally take ownership of their actions/inactions?  The ""nobody gives us credit for all we've done"" is reallly getting old."

2020-02-28 16:28,"Is the media making up the plummet of the stock market, or just making that up to hurt the president too?"
2020-02-28 17:09,"No, you are wrong Mr. Mulvaney.  Trump and his enablers like you have caused this all on your own.  Nobody can fully put any faith in this president because he has made a mockery of truth.  This is the world he created all by himself and the likes of you.  The media of course plays on it because it's cognizant of the shambles in the White House where people like you quake in your boots in fear of the great leader.  This might finally be the first time trump is not in control of his destiny and the republican (trump) party face a reckoning.  I can only hope this might be the case."
2020-02-28 17:12,"As much as the ""acting"" chief of staff lies and tries to ""act"" as a serious person he knows that his fate is to get thrown under the bus.  There is always Fox TV for his next job.  Till then,  keep ""acting"""
2020-02-28 17:33,"“He’s huge, but he’s still very young,”
From that point on down the article just relates things that are, in my mind, somewhat disturbing.

Why would any of us care about a 13 year old who's only claim to fame is that his dad is possibly the worst president to darken the door of the White House. He may well wish anonymity after all is said and done. Why would we care if he's huge or just a pipsqueak. Does Mulvaney believe that he has NFL potential?

If the President is missing days of sleep, that is cause for concern. Sleep deprivation is known to lead to lapses in judgement and concentration, and one wonders if the president, and to be fair, some of the Democratic Presidential Candidates are using chemical means to counteract that sleep deprivation..."
2020-02-28 16:23,"“Mr. Mulvaney said the administration took “extraordinary steps four or five weeks ago,” to prevent the spread of the virus...”

I guess this is why the DOW is down 3000  points just this week; faith in the Trump Administration.

Coronavirus will not need any help from the Democrats. It’s capable of wiping out this Administration all on its own.

Trump should focus his ire on China and his cutting the budget of the CDC instead of going after Democrats.

But of course, when you’re inept, when your Administration doesn’t practice science, and when your Base, on average, has a tenth-grade education...hey, does it matter?"

The thought that people are scared and that this administrations inept handling of the situation is making matters worse never even crossed his mind. I’m at loss for words on how pathetic his statements are.

2020-02-28 17:00,"I have always detested Mulvaney.  But now?  Now he's outright dangerous.

Dear Mr. Mulvaney:  your attacks on public health and welfare are bad enough.  You are the person who wants to gut Meals on Wheels after all.

On another note, I hope Mrs. Trump rips him to pieces for bringing Barron into this nonsense against her wishes."

2020-02-28 16:45,"“He said, ‘I’ve only got eight years, I’m going to get as much out of it as I can,’” Mr. Mulvaney said.

And there it is, folks."
2020-02-28 18:00,The logic of Mr Mulvaney’s argument escapes me. How does accurate reporting on Mr Trump’s response to a potential coronavirus epidemic equate to trying to bring him down? We just witnessed a press conference during which Mr Trump’s statements about coronavirus were directly contradicted by medical professionals.
2020-02-28 17:50,"Requiring that any experts' information about COVID-19 and its risks be managed by the VP or WH Chief of Staff is ridiculous.  Attempting to muzzle the experts in their efforts to disseminate facts and medical advice is exactly what China did - and look where it got China.  How can an open society tolerate the restriction of knowledge, especially from actual experts and in the face of a potential global health problem?"
2020-02-28 18:00,"No one can believe anything WH says on any topic. The truth never gets the chance to step into the WH. What comes out is lack of information, any facts backing up coherent decisions. It's all political to their tune in November."
2020-02-28 17:58,This pandemic is a terrible and deadly example of how the Trump administration and the decades-long Republican campaign to gut the public sector has put us all at risk. Comments like this reveal just how little this government understands how vital well-funded and RESPECTED public agencies are.
2020-02-28 17:59,Trump's only response to any threat is to attack other humans. Without that option he would not have anything to do.
2020-02-28 17:53,""" Mr. Mulvaney said, 'the press would never show you that because it doesn’t fit that image of him, the press wants him to be this terrible monster.' ”
Cruel men, even those labeled as ""monsters,"" are perfectly capable of having warm, loving relationships with their children, other family members and friends.
Mulvaney's  argument, regarding his affection toward his children, is irrelevant to the issue of Trump's political, economic, and foreign policies."
2020-02-28 17:57,"Given what we know about the importance of sleep to humans (and other animals), especially when it comes to cognitive skills, failure to get enough sleep is nothing to brag about."
2020-02-28 17:53,"The flu kills people, yes. This flu kills 20x more people, hangs around longer, and will empty the streets around the world. Ultimately, our Freedom is going to be at stake. We need our Freedom to demand the Freedom of competent people to speak freely and protect us.  What a travesty that the most active person in social media received the Medal of Freedom Award and is arguing for suppression of speech from those that our economy and lives will depend upon."
2020-02-28 17:55,"If Mulvaney and Trump are so convinced, there is an age-old tradition politics leaders engage in where they expose themselves willingly to the object of fear, be it nuclear radion or contagious illnesses. Of course, most leaders in the world are not coronavirus-deniers, at least not at this point."
2020-02-28 17:51,"Millions are at risk of infection if this reaches a full pandemic, thousands of elderly and immunocompromised individuals will be at risk of mortality if this reaches a full pandemic. Yet, here we are, one of the most advanced nations in the field of medical research and biotechnology, and the president and his team are making the outbreak about how it could damage Trump PERSONALLY. He's not outraged because our citizens are at risk for infection, or because this could have a huge effect on world public health, he's outraged because it's making him look bad. If that doesn't tell you where Trump's loyalties lie, then I don't know what will. It certainly isn't with the American people."
2020-02-28 16:29,"Get real, Mr Mulvany and the rest of the White House staff! This is an ideal moment for your boss to display his oft-boasted presidential leadership qualities.
Continuing to downplay, deny, contradict, lie, blame others or play the victim during this coronavirus crisis will get him nowhere but voted out of office."
2020-02-28 16:53,"Ah, poor Mick Mulvaney. He so desperately wants to play with Donald and his friends. But they just keep him around because they like to make fun of him. Donald won’t even make him the Chief of Staff. So, so sad. 

Yes, Mick, if you can get ahead of the messaging, then you will probably be able to stop a biological process! Genius!"
2020-02-28 17:04,"Once again, it is always about Trump.  This administration has no concern for the people. They need to be reminded that many people could die from this virus."
2020-02-28 17:07,"The world turns, and it doesn't necessarily turn around Donald Trump. What about the Chinese intelligence together with the Dems having created the new Virus in their shared labs for no other reason than to weaken the POTUS's stand? Laughable. Not to mention the ""evil"" media all over the world. Sometimes I'm just so tired of this fool. Even worse are his staff. 45 might not realize what he is saying, Mulvaney and all the other minions know. And that's so disgraceful."
2020-02-28 17:14,"How much of this insanity are we going to tolerate?  

These false conspiracy theories by Mulvaney, Trump and the conservative propaganda machine do not need to be politely refuted by the media and the Democrats. Rather they need to  bluntly call them out and condemn them as being the purposeful, seditious and dangerous lies that they are.

Enough already.  The Democrats and the media need to grow some spines and stop pretending that the conservatives and Republicans have any decency, patriotism or ethics.  They don't and nothing says that louder than their choosing to attempt to diminish this very real health threat to the nation as being nothing more than partisan political hype."
2020-02-28 17:23,"Only in Trump’s circle of insanity is it a good thing to be sleep deprived. (I guess that means more time on Twitter and watching tv and stuffing his face with junk food.)

The planet and every living thing on it would be better off if Trump slept through the rest of his term..."
2020-02-28 17:56,"If only people would listen to Sean Hannity's interview with Mike Pence on Fox News, and not those dumb traders at all of the world's major investment banks who are selling stocks, then everyone would understand that the coronavirus is actually no big deal."
2020-02-28 15:48,"What a very strange, paranoid comment.  No, when you close down the pandemic operation  at CDC to save money and have insufficient supplies available in the event a pandemic should threaten, that is incompetence. When you ignore scientific analysis and go all polyanna--that's political chicanery."
2020-02-28 16:36,Incompetence is not a conspiracy.  Trying to cover it up is.
2020-02-28 16:36,"Mr Mulvaney, Mr. Trump is doing an admirable and sufficiently adequate job of bringing  his own self down by his continual lying, his debasement of science and his self dealing are evident to all but those in service to his “majesty”.   
Trump doesn’t need any help destroying himself he is doing just fine on his own."
2020-02-28 16:41,"My first reaction, laughing, even in this serious time. This guy comes out of the post-impeachment shadow and spews this nonsense. ""Acting"" is a perfect title."
2020-02-28 16:41,Perhaps Mr. Mulvaney and Mr. Trump should lead by example.  Fly out to Travis Air Force in California and give their “no problem here” speeches from Vacaville (where the infected woman is from).  Eat burgers at the local McDonald’s and glad hand the locals.
2020-02-28 17:01,"The White House is starting to panic. They attack everybody because they have no other response. I guess when can expect more ""approved' messages like this in the coming weeks."
2020-02-28 17:17,Of course. A worldwide pandemic is really about Trump.
2020-02-28 17:32,"the WH is not well, there is a sickness there and it is spreading
this article captures how wrong things have gotten with trump in power"
2020-02-28 17:35,"Normally I ignore the lies of the Trump Administration.
In this case, with all our lives at stake, I have to speak up.  

Why doesn't Mr. Mulvaney tell the world how the Trump Administration botched bringing the Americans back home from the Diamond Princess in Japan?  How Trump's Health Secretary, Alex Azar, ignored CDC vehement objections to bringing 14 Americans (who used their political Republican connections) back to the USA who were infected with the Coronavirus.  How the same Health Secretary then forced his employees to greet these infected Americans without proper safeguards, thus exposing all Americans near Travis Air Force Base and around the USA to the Coronavirus?

With Mr. Mulvaney downplaying the dangers of the Coronavirus and blaming media hype, he should be asked: Why does not he expose himself to an infected person to prove to the world how ""safe"" the Coronavirus is?"
2020-02-28 17:48,"The truly awful thing about this is not that Mr. Mulvaney said any of it. It’s that the CPAC and MAGA folks believe it, without reservation. Politicians have lied for millennia. Gullible, fearful, angry people have fallen for it just as long."
2020-02-28 17:52,Someone needs to tell this president and his staff that it isn't all about him.
2020-02-28 16:28,"The Administration is actually doing the best it can. This is really it!
That may be the saddest and least surprising thing about these grifters."
2020-02-28 16:30,"This is rich. Trump is a master at lying and distorting the truth. It looks like Mick Mulvaney is mimicking his boss.

Frankly, the media has been very easy on Trump. What’s more, Trump’s behavior, lies, and animus are far more newsworthy than his affection for Barron.

If Trump and  Mulvaney want more coverage regarding Barron, all they need to do is go on Fox and Friends."
2020-02-28 16:59,"This is scary and extremely dangerous.

No one is immune to this virus, including Trumpites.  If, or probably when, a severe outbreak does occur, perhaps Trumpites will finally acknowledge the lies and ineptitude at the heart of this administration."
2020-02-28 17:38,"Why is it surprising that so many Americans want to bring down this person who lost the election and uses the office to do so much harm to so many of us through lies, incompetence, partisanship and the destruction of our institutions? This includes the damage to the health care system which will lead directly to the preventable deaths of thousands if not millions of Americans from this virus."
2020-02-28 17:48,The usual Trump admin habit of missing the point entirely.
2020-02-28 17:33,Investors all over the world are losing billions (trillions?) for the sole purpose of bringing down the President.  They deserve a medal.
2020-02-28 17:43,"We need someone who is brave, a real leader, in the White House, not someone who constantly plays the victim. Is that too much to ask?"
2020-02-28 17:43,"It's more a case of the Republicans are out to get us, I fear."
2020-02-28 17:44,Trump is bringing down himself. Don’t blame it on others!
2020-02-28 17:59,"All we have to do to know Trump's opinion of COVID-19 is to  read the words of his lackeys. Mulvaney thinks it is a media stunt and Donald Junior is twisting it to somehow implicate the Democrats. It isn't that Trump doesn't believe in science, he doesn't even consider it. The universe revolves around him, and if something isn't benefitting him in some way then it isn't worth any of his short attention span."
2020-02-28 17:41,Well Trump and Pence can hold hands and give a prayer service  in The Rose Garden and just pray it all away.
2020-02-28 17:42,"Trump is in over his head - like the airline business or casinos where he suffered huge losses.  Except now we get to bear the worst consequences of this conman's incompetence.

I hope his ""base"" will wake up when the virus hits them and Trump's fabulous healthcare plan is found missing in action.  Unfortunately it will be a very costly tragedy for all of us."

I think Trump was talking about money."
2020-02-28 17:39,The administration is in trouble now.  It was coasting along largely untested until the double whammy of coronavirus and the stock market plunge.  The incompetence is showing through and the folks on Wall Street can smell it.  God help us all if one of our adversaries launches a military attack and these clowns are in charge.
2020-02-28 17:35,So now they are seeing things and hearing things that do not exist. They are indeed paranoid. they are not getting there they are there. I hope we make it to November before our country is total compromised by trumpisim. Exactly when do we start worrying?

2020-02-28 17:50,"Trump is furious about the stock market plunge. This could severely damage his re-election campaign. He exhibited no concern with coronavirus until the stock market tanked.
His news conference on coronavirus was a campaign speech rather than addressing what scientists know about the virus. What he said was refuted by the scientists on the podium.
When the market plunges, he and his sycophants must blame someone--the Dems and the press.
Coronavirus risks becoming a pandemic. I wonder how Trump will handle this in his 'stock market and economy great' campaign speeches."

2020-02-28 17:38,"Yes, Mr. Mulvaney, clearly the media should be talking about what a great father Trump is instead of the biggest global health crisis in decades and the consequent international financial market meltdown. Trump calls his son once in a while. Front page news! 

This administration is filled with outrageously incompetent toadies in a time of crisis, fuelling the concerns of everyone.  Instead of demonstrating even a modicum of professionalism and leadership they spout inanities, lies and spin. It was to be expected given their track record but it is still so depressing and worrying."
2020-02-28 17:45,"It's always Opposite Day in the trump administration. In fact, the media are not using the pandemic to ""bring down the president."" Rather, trump and his minions are using the crisis to prop up a failed presidency."

Will anyone bring criminal action against HHS Azar for his gross negligence and failures that enabled a community transmission from Travis Air Force Base in Northern California?  Is there any ability for State AGs to bring criminal action or indict this grossly negligent conduct that is potentially criminal conduct?

It would be really hard not to notice that the grifter and his family are busy getting as much out of his presidency as they can."
2020-02-28 17:34,"This most recent outrage is the logical outcome of Trump's rejection of science and facts and reliance on lies and paranoid politics.

This is the most recent example of Trump's use of ""fake news"" and calling the media ""an enemy of the people"" and attacking government as ""the deep state"" in order to convince his base to reject reality and insulate himself from criticism.

This is extremely dangerous from a public health perspective - because half the population will not believe public health experts - and further evidence of out slide into Fascism."
2020-02-28 17:47,It occurs to me that the Trump administration is downplaying this grave threat because they cynically calculate that the virus won’t be widely felt in their base of supporters
2020-02-28 17:43,"It is unnerving that in the midst of a global outbreak, the President still feels that he is being maligned by reporting of relevant, potentially life saving data.  His self-centered perspective on every topic is hard to look past."

2020-02-28 17:52,"Why does this administration believe that everything is about Donald Trump?  In Europe we have had copious coverage of Covid-19, not just in the papers and television news, but on call-in radio programs as well. Our interest in the possibility of a pandemic has everything to do with the strain on the health service and disruption to supply chains and zero to do with Donald Trump."
2020-02-28 17:53,"Once again, the Republicans are quick to politicize and point the finger of guilt everywhere except where it legitimately belongs: at themselves! 

The Trump administration will go down in U.S. history as among the absolute worst. Their venomous hate and division, divide and conquer mentality is often illustrative of their inability to address the real problems that confront the nation. Instead the nation is pretty much left to resolve its problems without the help of those in leadership positions. 

Take, for example, Mitch McConnell's refusal to allow paper ballots for the upcoming election cycle. Apparently, he is welcoming the outrageous intrusion of Putin's Russia in fixing the outcome of the November elections in the Republican's favor. Trump openly solicited Putin's help in this regard. How can anyone not construe this action as pure Treason! 

Finally, how in the world can ""we, the people"" redress our grievances if election outcomes are ""preordained"" by the powers that be?"
2020-02-28 17:59,Another pearl of wisdom from the acting Chief of Staff.  It's incredible how many 'acting' designations there are in the President's cabinet and key positions.  Does that mean that no one really wants to work full time for this man or does it simply signify that most of his staff are simply 'acting' as if they have any idea what they are doing?  To suggest that the Media is using this bungled reaction to a serious world wide health crisis to 'take him down' is ignoring his ability to do that all by himself.
2020-02-28 17:44,"Good. DT has never taken responsibility for his failings, e.g., repeated bankruptcies, and have also taken credit for others' successes (e.g., the economy he inherited from Obama). 

So there's a poetic justice in blaming him for the panic caused by the virus. On the other hand, much of the panic is caused by the fact that most intelligent people realize that he and his administration are utterly incompetent and not up to the task of dealing with the crisis. It is his Katrina, and he deserves it."
2020-02-28 17:04,"It may be that the virus covid19 and the stock market may kill off Trump in November.  A heavy price to pay but short of war.  The cumulative damage he has already done is huge and will take a huge effort of rebuilding all the agencies, departments as well as unfilled positions.  One of them was the CDC and here we are at the beginning of a pandemic with out a full working CDC.  Please NYT write more about the gutting of the CDC by the germ phobia president."
2020-02-28 18:02,But there’s something to this.  When did the Times cover an epidemic like this before?  It is not a new phenomenon.

2020-02-28 17:57,"Dear Mick,

You asserted publically:
""Media Covering Coronavirus to ‘Bring Down the President’ ""

If only it were:
    a. factually true
    b. possibly likely to work

Mick, the PRESS did not chose to disband and defund our ability to monitor and defend against completely predictable influenza-style epidemics -- the Trump administration did.

The PRESS did not chose to lie about the threat to the US or our preparations, the Trump administration did. 

The PRESS did not limit testing and the supply of test kits, your administration did. The result is, for the case in Vacaville, the virus was given an 11 day head start. 

The PRESS did not choose to use 30 unprotected people to process the Cruise Ship passengers at Travis AFB (at least 4 with known coronavirus) without providing protective gear and training in its use, then, once they were fully exposed, releasing them to return to airports and communities around the company. 

The PRESS did not choose to deny those with experience and knowledge of how to successfully fight an epidemic a voice, or resources -- you and your administration did. 

This crisis did not start with you -- but you now own it."

2020-02-28 17:53,"One tangible fact: the stock market is dropping rapidly.  Fact!

The Trump administration has fought to minimize fears over the potential effects of the virus.  Trump gave a speech which he himself described as one intended to calm fears of Americans.

Yet the stock market continues its decline.  Why? Because rich people, who should be Trump's strongest supporters don't believe him.

Lies simply compound the situation.  We don't almost have a vaccination ready.  It is not as mild as the flu with 30 times the death rate and no existing immunity in the population. People with no symptoms can apparently spread the disease.  Trump hasn't explained how you select people for quarantine who have no symptoms.  The government doesn't even have enough test kits ready to test to see if people are  infected.

Lies will not do well in a situation where Trump does not have full control of the information stream.  International sources and private medical sources are not under Trump/Pence control and they WILL go public at Trump attempts to cover up facts.  The mere fact that Pence, an established anti-science anti-medicine presidential minion was appointed as coordinator is even a clear indication of Trump's intent to cover up.  That intent is proven when the real facts are accessible.

If Trump wants to deal with COVID-19, make sure we are prepared to test and have adequate facilities and trained personnel to quarantine. And tell the American people the truth."
2020-02-28 18:10,Something like this just highlights the country is being run by self serving amateurs! Instead of elevating those who know how to handle the situation we have now got multiple people in charge of “messaging.”

Sure, investors are worried about shrinking business revenues from travel, service, and supply chain interruptions. But they're also cognizant of the fact that the clowns in charge have no real clue, only rhetoric."
2020-02-28 18:20,"Mr. Mulvaney we have known of this public health issue for well over 2  months.  Unless I’m mistaken China  rapidly built a hospital to accommodate the large numbers of citizens that became ill in a matter of days. Why haven’t we already assessed numbers of hospital beds, intensive care beds, availability of respiratory equipment and why have we not set up separate clinics in cities for people who have cough and fever to isolate them from other patients. And why don’t we have lower level care beds for those patients who are not critically ill but need hospitalization. And I understand that the interruption of supply chain has limited the amount of first line medication for this virus but there is no reason that we cannot initiate production of the necessary ingredient in this country. And why is it there’s price gouging on masks. And why haven’t we already increase the production of mask in this country knowing that this epidemic was likely to become a pandemic.￼
There is plenty of reasons to criticize the administration’s approach to containment of this pandemic. We don’t have to invent them.￼"
2020-02-28 15:47,"This president's tactic is clear - everything negative is an attack on his administration.   Everything that the fourth estate brings forward as a public service, that he feels does not serve him - is an attack.

At some point one presumes that even his ardent followers will become sick of the weakness he displays as a victim.

This virus and the market's response has nothing to do with Trump.

Even my company, an international engineering concern - is feeling the negative fiscal effects of the virus already.  China is essentially shut down to us.  Manufacturing and supply - is shut down.  Period.  We will not make our number this quarter.

Frankly, it seems nobody will.   

This is why the market is reacting  and it has little to do with our  narcissistic president and his hangers on."

It seems a bar too high to ask for standards and ethics today but at least we can point out the hypocrisy."
2020-02-28 18:05,"The media did not cut the pandemic/epidemic offices, staff, and leadership at the White house, and at the NSC.

The media is not anti science and anti knowledge, nor anti-research and anti fact, nor is the media anti government programs or leadership.

The media did not propose a budget with huge cuts this year for both the CDC and the NIH.

Ignorance is not bliss, and no amount of propaganda is going to paper over this."
2020-02-28 18:10,"Trump and his minions never disappoint; regardless of the problem it invariably boils down to politics and the desire of the deep state to bring down his presidency. The fact that thousands have contracted the coronavirus is secondary to Trump’s petty needs. But wait folks, all this concern about the virus will disappear when the weather gets warmer. In addition to being a stable genius Trump, no doubt, has degrees in medicine and meteorology."
2020-02-28 18:14,"“He said, ‘I’ve only got eight years, I’m going to get as much out of it as I can,’” Mr. Mulvaney said.    Only Trump would both think and then express such selfishness.  This is what he thinks of our country.  How much can I get?  Why would his administrators repeat these remarks?  It is appalling and they seem proud of it."
2020-02-28 18:08,"What a farce. Anything to place the blame on others, a Trump trait we have grown to recognize very well by now.

Trump rightfully deserves to take heat for this, due to his gutting of the CDC staff. 

Hopefully the slumping financial markets will be tied to Trump as well, and serve to damage his reelection chances."
2020-02-28 18:05,"I am certainly not surprised & have some thoughts about this, actual thoughts about it that I based on some actual research.  I'm retired & have a BA in history so I have little or no expertise with epidemiology but I do read, & more than one article I might add. I live in Northern CA so I am more interested in the first case reported where they could not determine the transmission point. Since I know that where this person lives in near Travis Air Force Base my thoughts were that she contracted it by being in the vicinity to the base. Now we know that our government people that met the evacuees were not trained for the interactions & did wear protective gear it's pretty clear how this poor woman may have contracted the disease most likely from coming in contact with these unprotected individuals. There are 8400 Californians being monitored. Let's just say that 5% of those people contract Covid19, that's 420 people & they say that each infected person could infect 3 more people, but to be conservative say that number is 1.5, that still makes 630 people & then continue to multiply that number by 1.5 & you can see how quickly this can get out of hand. Hopefully I am being way to loose with the numbers. The way to help understand what is really happening is to tell us the truth! SO TELL US THE TRUTH!"
2020-02-28 18:01,"How about “...the world is realizing that trump cannot manage a real crisis.”

Markets react. 

I’m honestly surprised these flunkies in the White House had any sort of employment prior to their current gigs."
2020-02-28 18:08,"It's official. The Trump White House guys are raving mad. These comments don't pass the sanity test. Democrats, Wall Street analysts, investors, national health ministries, cruise ship lines, the media, they're all out to get us."
2020-02-28 18:13,"So the strategy of Trump and his cronies to respond to a pandemic is by spewing conspiracy theories that they themselves don't even believe. It just shows the contempt the Trump ""administration"" has for all Americans, even its own supporters."
2020-02-28 18:13,Now I’ve heard everything. Mulvaney will be remembered for this statement and I’m hoping some of the more saner Republicans will turn against Trump. The best thing to happen will be for a good response from the Federal government to the virus. The worst would be for the government to respond only to Trump’s red states.
2020-02-28 18:03,"Yea, Its always about Trump.  The fact that the mortality rate far exceeds the normal flu rate mortality rate is more fake science in their limited sphere of scientific aptitude.  Pray they hear the pop."
2020-02-28 15:45,"Media only has to print Trump's exact comments.
Trump's is bringing down himself."
2020-02-28 16:04,"I suppose FOX news has been claiming that MAINSTREAM FAKE NEWS has not been covering steps to contain Coronavirus in the U.S. including restrictions on foreign entry. 

It's a blatant and no doubt strategically deliberate lie."
2020-02-28 16:14,"I'm sad for Mickey Mulvaney that he can't yet do math.  Every single day I read about how many deaths there are from this virus relative to confirmed cases, and I find it pretty alarming that 2-3% of people who contract it die.  At this time, it seems to kill at least twenty times more people who contract it than the seasonal flu virus does.  Until we know a bit more, wouldn't it be prudent to exercise caution?

Other nations, it seems, are exercising caution.  None other than than the good ole U. S. of A. are trivializing it.  Are other nations out to get Donald Trump?  Are other nations in cahoots with Nancy Pelosi to bring down Trump?  I this whole corona virus thing actually a big Chinese hoax like their climate change hoax?  Is that what Mickey thinks?

Regarding Barron, we normal Americans would prefer that the boy lead a normal life.  A normal life means remaining unmentioned by the press, period.

By the way, Mickey, maybe you and Stephen Moore can figure out how to get more of those desperately needed immigrants in here....you know, the ones you complained about us not having because your boss has closed our doors to everyone but the Norwegians.

These people, and Mickey Mulvaney is a prime example, are so ridiculous, it's just stunning."
2020-02-28 16:14,Yet more reason to vote blue no matter who.  Vote blue at every level. Remove the bullying victim clan at all levels.
2020-02-28 16:17,"Pure, unadulterated fear on the part of the Trump administration. A virus cannot be bullied into submission."
2020-02-28 16:26,This is a world-wide pandemic affecting everyone. We are only allowed to hear good news in Trumpist America? This isn’t North Korea.
2020-02-28 17:11,"They should just do their jobs, or get out.  When you don't do the job, and you ignore the facts, go home."
2020-02-28 17:58,It is difficult to comprehend the level of narcissism necessary to believe a world wide pandemic is about one's self. A profoundly ill man.
2020-02-28 18:05,"Trump doesn't need the press to ""bring him down.""  He's doing a great job all by himself."
2020-02-28 18:08,I don't think anyone in the high food chain of the Trump administration believes any of what they say. They are by passing the educated classes to appeal directly to the less educated elements of society who believe they have little control over their lives and trust Trump to protect them. The several times a day absurd statements from Trump Tweets and statements have passed all points of reason.
2020-02-28 18:13,"Finally, just maybe, we maybe leaving the Trump spin zone into the reality zone---where the public finds out that he is a fake President."
2020-02-28 18:14,Mr. Mulvaney continuously minimizes questionable behavior and decision-making by this White House. I guess we're all supposed to get over our concerns that coronavirus could become a public health emergency.
2020-02-28 17:53,"Mr. Trump and company are pathetically incompetent when attempting to deal with anyone or anything refusing to succumb to bullying. What is next? Perhaps Mr. Trump and his sycophants will reveal the virus originated in Nancy Pelosi’s kitchen and was spread by Hillary Clinton. It seems an unlikely turn, but Kellyanne Conway can spin it well enough to get the Fox propaganda machine running with it in full voice. The Republican Party leadership solution to the episode will be first to deny its existence and as the number of infections increases insist on corporate tax cuts, abortion restrictions and more guns."
2020-02-28 18:03,It's becoming clear that competence matters. Trump will not face a less competent opponent in November.
2020-02-28 18:04,"I am surprised Mulvaney didn’t simply say, “Get over it,” as he did when he admitted that there was a quid pro quod for military aid to Ukraine.
As for his claim that the media is simply out to get Trump, corporations concerned about coronavirus and scientists who deal in data and fact-based evidence don’t act out of the desire to “get Trump.”  They are simply doing their best to deal with a possible pandemic that could harm public health, interrupt supply chains, and potentially disrupt economies."
2020-02-28 18:10,"The nation faces very serious health and economic crises, and Trump has the time to send his staff to whine about how he isn't getting good media coverage.

Impeach him once more. And again. However long it takes to get this absolutely useless clown out of office."
2020-02-28 18:01,"One of the dangers of climate change was that there could be new, more dangerous diseases as temperatures changed our environment.  I read this in a variety of publications on how climate changes could impact our planet.  The wise course of action would have been to increase or at least maintain NIH funding rather than let go of all the scientists.  Trump is not wise, and I hope, as he starts hiding information on the coronavirus and bungling its management, people finally realize that."
2020-02-28 18:01,Is it too much to ask to have a President to know the death rates of the flu and Coronavirus? But then again after the Iranian missile attack on the US base in Iraq and 34 soldiers suffered concussions and other brain injuries and Trump said they just had headaches doesn’t give Americans or the media confidence that Trump cares much about anyone but himself.
2020-02-28 18:09,"Can you imagine if the press/media started covering Baron? The children of the presidents' have been off limits as long as I can remember and each time the press even mentioned a child, they were immediately told to stop, children are off limits! But knowing what we do about this horrific individual, he probably told Mulvaney to do exactly what he did, bring in Baron and use him any way you can."
2020-02-28 18:02,"Mr. Mulvaney might suggest that Mr. Pence call me for some pointers.
I used to be the COO of a pediatric rehabilitation hospital in Philadelphia.  We had many children with allergies and immunological problems, infants with bronchopulmonary dysplagia, children with cerebral palsy and many different syndromes. We never had any spread of germs that might have harmed one of the patients in our charge.
I know this experience might not equal the needs of a nation confronting what looks to be a pandemic, but based on the current knowledge base within the president's immediate circle, there might be a few points that could be learned.
It never came to mind that the coronavirus might somehow translate into a ""plot"". But I guess everything is about the president and his hoped-for re-election, not the life or death of the rest of us."
2020-02-28 18:03,"Silence from the administration has been until now deafening. 

I don't hear Mulvaney describing the administration engaging early with China to understand and address coronavirus contagion or treatment. And little is known how the US has readied itself.   

It appears that administration action is forthcoming only after the world economies voice dismay via lower stock market prices. Price drops that put Trump in poor light."
2020-02-28 18:05,"The White House response to media coverage is like the Chinese response to media coverage. Even in China, people found a way to get around the watered down information.

No way that Pence will be able to control the message, and not only because he is the totally wrong person to be in charge of this."
2020-02-28 18:09,"The annual influenza strain causes more illness and deaths every year than the coronavirus or any other flu type virus like swine flu,  bird flu and the alphabet flues; A, B, C, and D. 

The media sees a clear opportunity to damage the Trump Administration and Trump's election prospects by hyping the danger of coronavirus, without any evidence. To the mainstream media all potential negative issues in American Society should be magnified far beyond the actual impact to Americans, as to further the political interests of the Left and the Democratic Party."
2020-02-28 18:06,"In other words, ""People die all the time.  Get over it.""  Perhaps that's the only script Mick has."
2020-02-28 17:16,"We need Trump and his Sycophants out of there on Jan. 20, 2021. Vote Blue up and down the ticket in November! 

John Kennedy was regretting his vote when he was drilling the Homeland Security Sycophant who knew nothing about anything the other day."
2020-02-28 16:35,"No matter how intelligent and educated Mulvaney strives to look with his glasses, like Rick Perry, it doesn't make him intelligent. Once he opens his mouth, like Perry the truth of his lack of intelligence comes out forcefully."
2020-02-28 18:02,"It would be nice to trust Mr. Mulvaney, but in the wake of 

“No, I did not asleep with that porn star” and 

“No, I did not coerce Ukraine into finding dirt on my political rival” and 

“No, I did not pardon certain people because their friends and my political cronies lobbied for it”, and 

“No, Obama was not born in the US” and,

“No, Mexico will pay for the Wall” and 

“No, the Russians did not interfere in the 2016 election”,

well, I just find it really challenging to believe anything this Administration says.  Mr. Mulvaney should simply stay in his office, and off the TV, and focus his time on the important business his job calls for."
2020-02-28 18:03,"Oh Mick, please. How about this headline: “Media covers administration’s inadequate response to virus.”"
2020-02-28 16:41,"Democrats will again unilaterally disarm in order to be  the adults in the room and bend over backwards to not appear to be politicizing the corona virus crisis while Trump does the opposite and pounds the Democrats for trying to gain advantage politically.

I notice he is going to a rally in South Carolina tonight."
2020-02-28 16:45,He can't bully a virus.
2020-02-28 16:49,mulvaney is a bigger fool than we give him credit for being. the presidents children / family have been off limits to the media by mutual agreement for as long as i can remember out of respect for them.
2020-02-28 17:00,"So the World Health Organization raised the global threat level to “very high” not due to the threat of the Corona virus but just to take down President Trump?  

I have a not insignificant portion of my net worth tied to the market and much more importantly a wife eight months pregnant.  If you think democrats' reaction to this virus is solely or primary to hurt the president, you are out of your dang mind.  We all desperately need leadership here not egomania."
2020-02-28 17:19,Yeah. Because everyone lives their lives and protects their family worrying first & foremost about how it affects..Donald Trump. /s

2020-02-28 17:56,"Mikey, Mikey, Mikey....many of us in the NYC arae already know about Trump's parenting ""skills"", from reading Ivanka's comments over her life. Sure dad calls, but thats the bulk of it. Calls, even if he's inthe same building, Ivanka said he would call her over going to see her. Plus being a good dad doesnt make him a great man. or a great president. Bernie Madoff's kids said he was a good dad...but he was still a dirty con man. a criminal can be a good dad...sorta. making it irrelvant to his overall job performance."
2020-02-28 18:22,....and who cares about the King's son Barron? No one.

2020-02-28 16:46,"When Ebola was a thing, certain prominent 'christians' loudly proclaimed it was God's punishment because of what the Democrats had done to America.

What do they say now?

If the Almighty was angry at the misguided Dems, he surely is livid at the havoc created by Trump and his Conservative backers.

A plague of locusts in Africa, floods in Mississippi, panic among the money-changers, what next?

Better Vote Blue, No Matter Who!"
2020-02-28 17:43,"Sleep deprivation probably impacts Trump’s narcissistic judgements. Full stop. Fuerther, I would NOT trust Mulvaney’s remarks as far as I can throw him. Your example is Baron. Really?"
2020-02-28 16:47,"What is wrong with these people?  It's as if they've all been mentored by Rush Limbag and Roy Cohn.


Mulvaney could claim that the media is covering the corona virus to make trump look like a suspension bridge.  Doesn't mean they are."
2020-02-28 16:52,"When they have no clue they:
1. Blame the media
2. Blame the Democrats

2020-02-28 17:31,I am so weary of this Administration and its inward focus.  Any body else with me?
2020-02-28 17:44,Does ANYONE in this administration have a conscience?
2020-02-28 18:08,"How is this administration's ""filtering"" the news from scientists about the virus different from the way the dictatorship in China handled it?"
2020-02-28 18:10,"Mr Mulvaney, please continue to gather large groups of ultra conservatives for close contact, to smugly discuss how trivial Covid-19 is."
2020-02-28 18:30,"CDC Director Tom Friedman, said, ""“that pointing fingers of blame will not be constructive here.” 2014

Times change"
2020-02-28 16:50,"This sounds more like a lame attempt to make us feel sorry for trump. Nevermind the evidence on a world stage that this virus is spreading and has a 2% death rate. This is a new strain of an existing virus so just stop talking about other viruses who are completely different. There's no immunity and no vaccine for this. You're status of ""acting"" hasn't changed because you work for an incompetent leader who doesn't trust you.

Get over it."
2020-02-28 17:26,"Finally Mike Mulvaney has actually spoken the truth. The media ARE using caronavirus to bring down the president, by pointing out the stupidity of slashing the CDC budget and standing solidly against science at every turn. 

Yes, the media are using caronavirus to hang the president, but they are using his rope to do it."
2020-02-28 18:01,"Here’s to hoping that Coronavirus disproportionately affects Republicans over the age of 80. There, I said it!"

They are only saying this to preserve capital. Truly disgusting."
2020-02-28 17:49,"Even faced with a pandemic, this administration thinks it can con its way out of it. In the meantime they are as vulnerable as everyone else since they are not testing people at fast enough rates to know if the disease is spreading in Washington D. C."
2020-02-28 16:50,"Mulvaney, acting White House chief of staff, is not a real or serious chief, but he plays one on TV.

2020-02-28 17:27,"""Mr. Mulvaney, who was interviewed onstage by Stephen Moore, whose expected nomination by the president to the Federal Reserve Board was withdrawn over concerns about his treatment of women, also asserted that Mr. Trump did not sleep on the overnight plane trip home from India or during the day before his news conference on coronavirus Wednesday night.

“'He said, ‘I’ve only got eight years, I’m going to get as much out of it as I can,’' Mr. Mulvaney said.'

Uh oh. Looks like another great leader's record is about to be smashed:

2020-02-28 17:29,Yes Trump's lackeys are in full array since when Trump loses in November they no longer matter and most folks would want nothing do with these parasites. Yes the virus is a plot by the deep state to remove the greatest leader the world has ever known a legend in his own mind. Hannity and Don Jr the Russian contact man is ranting and raving about the media destroying Trump a living god in their small minds. Trump's sycophants including Pence who must spin every virus comment to be in praise of Trump. Trump's lackeys are blaming the democrats for the huge drop in the market and only Trump will invent a cure .
2020-02-28 17:45,Yet another outrageous claim by this president and his administration to downplay and obfuscate the fact that they have no idea of what they're doing in face of a natural catastrophe that is beyond their capacity.

    We have seen the videos in other countries and we have also read the news even in their own language newspapers. News travels fast nowadays and we needn’t rely on the Trumped up words of our dishonest president. 
Americans simply know better. We  don’t accept Mulvaney’s or Trump’s stupidly desperate, and dangerous lies.  A Nurse"
2020-02-28 17:15,I'm sure the CPAC crowd ate that nonsense up! How absurd that such a significant portion of the political community is so comfortable living in an alternate reality. Sigh.
2020-02-28 17:55,"Trump's efforts to control the coronavirus ""message"" (by requiring everything said by government health officials and experts to be pre-cleared by Pence, a science-denying hack) is no different than what China's communist regime did/is doing.   And China's early suppression of the truth of the coronavirus's seriousness and deadliness resulted in thousands of deaths and its global spread.   There is no coronavirus conspiracy to bring down Trump.   Trump is doing it to himself because he's too cocky and incompetent to handle this crisis maturely and methodically and his cheerleading flacks are deflecting for him.   I hope not too many people will suffer and die because of this administration's cocky incompetence."

The incompetent oaf in the White House, and his gaslighting phalanx of Republican sycophants, was troubling for three years when they didn't immediately or directly affect me or my children. Today, I worry about the ant-science Republicans and the Trump Administration not only screwing up the country's response to the Coronavirus, but also approaching communication about the virus through their standard hyper-politicized frame and point of view. It's not helpful. The stock market, the American people and the world see through Donald Trump's ignorance and lies. And putting Mike Pence in charge? Our country is in BIG trouble."
2020-02-28 18:26,"When will Mulvaney and company grow up and put the US and all of us first, before themselves, to control the coronavirus within the US.

The head of CDC, through many administrations, Dr. Anthony Fauci and his group of immunology specialists, already stated, that a test vaccine could be ready in about six months. And overall, it would take a year and a half to complete.  It was Dr Fauci who led the Ebola virus cure.

Yet, Trump and his administration has put Secretary Azar, a former lobbyist, and VP Pence in charge.

Yet, none these people have the requisite scientific expertise to manage this plague, which has already killed thousands of people, and can kill millions, worldwide."
2020-02-28 18:25,"How dare ""the media"" report exactly what's going on, and exactly how Trump is dealing with this threat?!

How dare 'the media' report what actually happens, instead of what Trump's administration -wants- them to report?!

This threat is not our fault... it's 'the media', failing to report it when we tell them how great we are."
2020-02-28 18:25,"Yes, Mr. Mulvaney.  The media really is reporting on the virus to bring down the president.  Good Lord, the level of narcissism it takes to think that way has rarely been seen in history.  The idea that one can twist what will soon be a pandemic into “it’s all about me” would be laughable if it and the virus weren’t so dangerous.  No, Messrs Mulvaney and Trump: it’s not about you.  It’s about us, our health, our economy and all that goes with that."
2020-02-28 18:35,"Doesn’t this administration realize they reap what they sow? They have at best a strange relationship with truth and then they expect the population to take verbatim what they say about this soon-to-be pandemic?

We don’t believe anything the stable genius says."

“Why didn’t you hear about it?” Mr. Mulvaney said of travel restrictions.

The same reason the captain of the Titanic did not say anything to the passengers about the potential for icebergs."

Your government is broken.  Badly.  Insane people are running your country.

Apple, Starbucks and major corporations are calling down their earnings guidance as business grinds to a halt in China.

Turning facts into lies.  Turning reality into fiction, all under the guise of truth?  Incredibly dangerous.  Everything this administration does is massively damaging.

2020-02-28 18:32,Headline is all wrong. It states that Mulvaney believes the media are covering the virus ‘to bring down the president’. But the story points out that Mulvaney believes the impeachment coverage was the media’s effort ‘to bring down the president’.
2020-02-28 18:34,"Watching FOX cable just now, the commentator first echoed how Democrats are using the virus to scare voters, then he described what kinds of masks we should buy to protect ourselves."

2020-02-28 18:15,The press is reporting information disclosed by official sources. This is one of Trump’s assertions of alternative facts and of reliable news being fake. Ignore Mulvaney if you want to know what is going on.
2020-02-28 18:17,"“This is not Ebola. It’s not SARS, it’s not MERS. It’s not a death sentence, it’s not the same as the Ebola crisis.”

Wow...  Ebola had a much higher fatality rate but was never a risk to developed countries.  Mulvaney is confusing fatality rate with risk to a population. I don't think there is anyone in public health that would argue that Ebola posed a greater risk in the United Sates than COVID-19.  It's not only Trump who has no idea what he is talking about."
2020-02-28 18:21,"Just stop the FAKE NEWS, Mr. Mulvaney.  This is a pandemic and your FAKE PRONOUNCEMENTS as the virus is now in  over 150 countries is your diversionary tactic and deliberate attempt to make this a more chaotic situation than a sane, sobering solution -based plan as we move forward in this country to manage this epidemic.  Just stop it - the media is not trying to bring down Trump - the media is telling the truth and yes, it runs contrary to Trump's whitewashing what is happening here."

2020-02-28 18:16,"Melania says don't cover Barron, the media listens, Mulvaney rebukes the media for respecting the wishes of the First Lady. I like that the media keeps its distance from Barron. It's something neither the Obamas' nor the Clintons' children enjoyed that while Barack and Bill were in office. No matter what America's relationship with President Trump is, Barron is just a kid. He should be able to have a childhood without being used as a political prop for  Mulvaney and the rest of the Trump administration."
2020-02-28 18:20,The virus isn't about Mr. Trump...unless he bungles the response and put our country in danger.

2020-02-28 18:22,"All President Trump needs to do to silence the media is to take useful and effective action as a leader: Speak to the nation to calm our fears and tell us how to prepare, explain what services there are, give us the info that science tells us is right to do. Speak to the UN about the global crisis. Mobilize aid. Call a summit to address concerns about the global supply chain. Propose legislation. 

Here's what doesn't work: 
1. Tweeting blame and finger-pointing at the media for reporting the facts.
2. Sending Mulvaney out to do the same.
3. Firing the Pandemic Response Team from the National Security Council.
4. Appointing a religious extremist who doesn't believe in science to be in charge of the issue.
5. Boasting that our 409Ks are doing great, and if they're not, it's our fault. 
6. Hiding."
2020-02-28 18:26,"He's half right. No, the media isn't hyping the story to bring down Trump. But yes, there seems to be a tad too much alarm in the media's tone. It's more serious than the flu because, apparently, the fatality rate is many times more than that of the flu. But the chance that an ordinary person using reasonable precautions will be infected seems very low right now. 

Both the government and the media have an obligation to not cause unnecessary panic while informing the public of the facts. I'll trust the NYT's over Trump's people - even though I may need to use my own discretion to put the pandemic in perspective."

2020-02-28 18:27,"Our narcissist President feels the world revolves around him.  The only thing Trump worries about is Trump.

And who cares about Trump's relationship with his son?  What does that have to do with the reality of the coronavirus that the entire world is dealing with?  Absolutely nothing.  

Smoke and mirrors - that's how the Trump Presidency rolls.
Now that Pence is in charge of the coronavirus updates - the truth will be hidden to insure D Trump looks good, the stock market rises, so that Trump can get reelected."

I have to walk 4 blocks to my job with the rest of the ordinary people , and Mike at certain hours of the day when people are walking to work the sidewalks are crowded, and people jam up at the crosswalks, and there is always somebody in the crowd with a cough, i try to hold my breath

at lunch i have to go out with the rest of the regular people and stand in line at food carts, or at Mcdonalds, surrounded by other people, and the people behind the counters they are regular people,with few paid sick days. some have coughs, i try to hold my breath.

After work when i go to the local neighborhood grocery store i am surrounded by other people in a store with narrow aisles,  if someone has a cough its hard to hold your breath for so long

If someone like Hillary, or Obama or even Bloomberg was president so many directives to keep us safe would be coming out of the white house it would make your head spin. 

Maybe your President is going to wake up and actually do something to keep us safe, perhaps he is going to make intelligent decisions and pick the best people rather than the people who agree with him, maybe he is going to do all that...but i'm not holding my breath."

That's the big ""tell"" that I find chilling. He's saying exactly what he means. He doesn't want to give or help or lead or inspire or even govern. His only interest in being POTUS is to personally ""get as much out of this as he can."" That really says all anyone needs to know, doesn't it?"
2020-02-28 18:26,"Perhaps, instead of being paranoid about the virus and engaging in a PR offensive this administration could start getting in front of events.

The reason Trump’s precious stock averages are plummeting is that the investing public does not find Trump and Pence credible and are left to imagine what they are NOT being told. 

They should appoint someone who has credibility with the broad public to oversee and manage a public effort to inform and prepare citizens for a serious epidemic. Then the public would be more reassured that there is a plan. Right now, it’s just more dishonesty and suspicion."
2020-02-28 18:42,"As an asthmatic and cancer patient, I absolutely want to know everything I can learn about this virus.  I'm immunocompromised, and thus at risk from every virus out there.  A common cold during radiation made me really sick.  What will COVID-19 do to me?  

I want our federal health science agencies free to do their work without political interference.  President Obama set up a pandemic response team that Trump eliminated.  Pence's actions as governor of Indiana during a serious HIV outbreak do not inspire confidence in his ability to coordinate federal responses.  Sec. Azar's pharmaceutical industry ties do not inspire confidence in his ability to urge that industry to make treatment and prevention widely available and affordable for all.  Indeed, quite the reverse:  I cannot help but believe that these officials have set us up for tragedy.  If that plays out, the current administration will deserve political ouster and history's condemnation."

Unknown virus infecting and killing people around the world?  Nothing to see here, but DO blame the media (for reporting the news about the pandemic).  Can anyone imagine the alternative?  It would be panic and rumor.  We might as well be the Eastern-most province of China as far as the iron-fisted approach to information dissemination of this administration.  They are clueless about what it takes to keep people calm, and feckless when it comes to learning from past efforts.  I hope the mask finally comes off of this administration."

Anyhow, Trump doesn't need ""the media"" to bring him down. He's doing quite a nice job of that all on his own by virtue of his sheer incompetence. Wall Street agrees. I suppose we should ignore that too, but it's a little tough at the moment."
2020-02-28 18:55,"This post truth era we live in is dangerous and scary. Trump is now filtering CDC information. We need nonpartisan, sober, eyes-open work with free and open communication, not attacks on the media. The Dems polarization of the crisis is no better. It’s always got to be tit for tat in our partisan times. 

When Mick M. looks back at his time in the White House - we all know he’s on his way out after impeachment - this will be remembered by him as a low point in his work. He already lacked the courage to testify or fight for the right to testify after flirting with the thought by attempting to join Bolton’s lawsuit. These comments eliminate his remaining dignity. 

We need men and women of conviction that our country over party. We need to return to truth over partisanship."
2020-02-28 18:37,"I think Mulvaney needed to say something crazy like this to take any remaining focus off what he said last week:

""My party is very interested in deficits when there is a Democrat in the White House. The worst thing in the whole world is deficits when Barack Obama was the president. Then Donald Trump became president, and we're a lot less interested as a party.""

I'm sure that didn't go over too well with the higher-ups."

2020-02-28 18:48,This comment by Mulvaney is a perfect example of the priorities of this administration. This is a global pandemic. This rises above petty political ideology and conspiracy theories. The fact that Trump and his yes men can't set their priorities straight is a clear reminder of how poorly they are serving the country as a whole. Republicans and Democrats can contract the virus in equal numbers--don't they get that?
2020-02-28 18:50,"Trump has denied the truth on so many occasions that his word is without value.  He claims there is nothing to see here, but Wall Street knows better.  He can hardly blame Democrats for this self-inflicted wound.  In fact, while he has eliminated the team of CDC professionals qualified to deal with this situation in favor of Michael Pence, the ""do nothing"" Dems are negotiating a bi-partisan bill intended to address this situation.

This is election interference all over again.  While serious people try to figure out how to protect our elections, Trump does everything he can to undercut the trained professionals equipped to resolve the issue.  In the end, he will never accept responsibility for his mistakes.  This is the story of his life, and to hear him tell it he has never made them.  Only a fool would believe him."
2020-02-28 18:50,"Previous lying, once regarded by his supporters as just entertaining, is turning out to be unattractive during a national and international health emergency.

I am angry not just at Trump and his lying minions like Mulvaney, but also at all of the American citizens who supported him in the 2016 election - and on his TV program before then. When did our values include lying and boasting about one's wealth?  My memory is that it started with the Reagan Administration which was a parade of wealth before those less fortunate or clever at manipulating the entertainment or financial markets.

I hope this current health crisis will begin a return to bedrock vaues of honesty, integrety, and full disclosure. Mick Mulvaney is not qualified to be a spokesperson for that movement."
2020-02-28 18:51,"Mr. Mulvaney: 
The health and welfare of the American people is far greater than the frightening political agenda of this White House. It is unquestionable, and more visible every day, that the health and welfare of we Americans is of little or no concern to this Administration and the self-serving wealthy who run it.  It is they who will go to any lengths to support and protect their incredibly illiterate, misinformed and chaotic ""leader.""  But, in my opinion, it is NOT those individuals whom we should fear, it is our very own fellow American citizens who no longer think or reason for themselves.  They have drunk the sweet poison that this President and his fellow Republican leaders have placed before them, and yet it is those very leaders, who should be informing, we citizens, of the truth about this impending health disaster.  When ignorance of facts and of truth, in all matters, is embraced as unquestionable, then we, as individuals, must take it upon ourselves to discern fact from fiction and truth from lies. Will so many of our fellow citizens blindly follow this President and his administration down a path to a health calamity like that of 1918?"

Covering a global pandemic instead of doing puff pieces on what a loving dad Trump is? The absurdity of THAT aside, the very idea that Trump is a loving dad is on its face just ridiculous. Has anyone ever seen Trump have a single affectionate, or even familial, interaction with that child? On the few times they've been in public together, Trump barely seems to know who the kid is. He has literally referred to him as ""Melania's"" son. The boy's discomfort on camera, at any sort of public appearance, and in the presence of his father is so palpable that he's  been notably absent from events where it would -- normally -- have been appropriate, even expected, to see the teenage child of a president, like baseball games, NASCAR rallies or last year's trip to England. Trump has no relationship with that kid at all, much less a loving one. If Mulvaney's turning to this, he must really be desperate."

He needs to get over it, accept it, and shut up except for, if he can do it, rally Americans to prepare and have the right attitude. And, he needs to let the experts be experts and not saying stupid things when they are right next to him. And, frankly, they need to be strong and speak up and out and not be muzzled by the White House. This will run its course, but before it does all of us will be seriously inconvenience and many will get sick, and too many will die. Who is making sure every community knows how to respond? Pence?

2020-02-28 18:11,"What will bring this president down will not be the media, but disgruntled voters in November.  Trump's continued arrogance, ignorance and refusal to tell the American people the truth about this life threatening virus is what will bring him down.

So, with all due respect to Mick Mulvaney, ""Get over it!"""
2020-02-28 18:13,Take five minutes to check out the websites of virtually every major newspaper in the world and you will find this virus as the lead story. Amazing how every country's respective media worldwide is using Coronavirus to bring down their own leaders!
2020-02-28 18:25,"POTUS is ignorant and has no public health expertise. The American people are being placed at risk for serious illness or death with his wholly inadequate response, appointment of   People with no expertise and who repeat false information and act like autocrats by controlling information that the public needs. If you did not think POTUS was a clear and present danger before you certainly should now."
2020-02-28 18:48,"It was only a matter of time before this Administration blamed The New York Times, The Washington Post, MSNBC, CNN etc. for the breakdown in the US's ability to respond to a global crisis -  characterized (by Mr. Mulvaney) as an effort to 'Bring Down the President.'  That's so silly because, apart from the Coronavirus itself, nothing comes close to bringing down Trump as Trump himself.  Mr. Mulvaney should heed his own advice when it comes to his Administration's capacity for self-destruction:  ""Get Over It.'"
2020-02-28 16:30,"The coronavirus is spreading. Should we just ""get over it,"" acting White House chief of staff Mulvaney? Should we just hand over the reins to a non-science believing stiff vice-president to handle this global health crisis? It's not all about Trump, Mr. Mulvaney. Get over it."
2020-02-28 16:32,"This administration is pathetic, just one incompetent individual after another, not fit for purpose in the role they have been put in. Case in point Alex Azar, head of HHS, no medical experience. He is a former lobbyist for the pharma industry.

They make this all about Trump, and at this stage who cares, this is about the well being of the nation. The markets are tanking because people feel that this administration has not positioned the country to get ahead of this virus. There are only a handful of test kits in the country. Apparently just 200 in California alone, and these are just single use.

Trump will be judged harshly for many things he has done, but if he does not get all a handle on this crisis, that will be his lasting legacy with people dying of a preventable virus. Putting the bobble head Pence in charge is ridiculous. Trump is just setting him up for failure so he can justify switching out the VP before the election."

2020-02-28 18:55,"The world is responding to a --rather predictable according to epidemiologists - new virus outbreak and the White House can find nothing better to do than to tell us how Trump is the real victim.

Very frustrating for the Trump haters."
2020-02-28 18:48,"Trump now has the national emergency coming he needs to suspend the election. As for the markets, he must be deranged. No sense of urgency either about that or the virus.

2020-02-28 16:06,"Once again the administration and Don Jr. keep spreading dangerous lies about the media and democrats trying to bring Trump down. It's called deflection - instead of focusing on the health crisis they continue to whine about a conspiracy to undermine Trump. He's doing a good job of undermining himself without any help from the media or democrats. 
The comments by Mulvaney that this is just basically a bad cold is incredibly naive and ignorant. Let's lead the masses to believe all is well even as they jump off a cliff. 
It's incredible how quickly the republicans forget how they tore into Obama during the Ebola outbreak and how he handled it - which turned out to be very effective. That's the problem with the GOP - short term memory loss when it's convenient for them. They are so good at turning the tables and creating revisionist history. 
Somebody needs to remind them of their own behavior when they went after Obama. In the meantime, we need a bi-partisan push for truth and transparency and resources. Get off the bandwagon and stop pushing false narratives - that's how fascists work. And please someone - muzzle Don Jr."

This story proves it."
2020-02-28 18:42,"Truth be told there is no coronavirus, or COVID-19. The whole thing is FAKE NEWS started by the ""good friend"" of Putin's Donny, President Xi, to bring down Donny to fight the trade war. There is in fact no lock down in China and no flight cancellation to and from any where.

Then the world news picked it up and further exaggerated the fake news to bring down Donny. The ""market"", at least the US one, has been going up by around 1000 point every day. The Fake News, including Fox ""News"" this time, made things up and said it was going down by about 1000 point a day. All of this is just to bring down Donny regardless of the damage done to the world.

War is Peace, Freedom is slavery, Ignorance is Strength.

2020-02-28 18:57,"Mr. Mulvaney,
When American citizens start dying in groups at a time like we now see in China will you recommend that the president offer ""Thoughts and Prayers"" for the dead and their surviving relatives or suggest we use science in an attempt to prevent more deaths?"
2020-02-28 18:57,"Trump, his advisors, and his followers all firmly believe that ""truth"" and ""real"" are negotiable terms.  Reality is optional in their world.   Nothing is true, especially if it hurts the t
Trump cause: tearing down the Federal bureaucracy.  Therefore, this virus must be part of some scheme or other confabulation made up by the deep state or Trump's enemies.  It is obvious."
2020-02-28 18:57,"Maybe Trump should show us just how overblown this crisis is by visiting Wuhan and their hospitals, without any personal protective equipment. Even better, he should hold a summit with Kim Jung Il simultaneously."
2020-02-28 18:58,"As always, he’s paranoid, and unwilling to take responsibility (not that he’s to blame for a virus), as if the media is simply making it all up.    It’s always someone or something else trying to “bring him down”.  Bringing up Barron is pretty bizarre, clearly intended as a distraction.  It’s red meat for Fox and the right wing media, something for them to focus on so we won’t talk about a deadly virus and how unprepared he is to deal with it."
2020-02-28 18:58,"Here's the thing. There's no way people other than Trump don't realize that, like, the science is right. Don't they realize they're painting themselves into a corner on this?

Darker possibility: they will simply n-tuple down on conspiracy theories and begin the insane scapegoating to save their Dear Leader. Especially once broad emergency powers are enacted.

Perhaps our paranoid west wing occupants should stop downplaying it, or blame their political enemies, and instead do the best they can to prepare us all.

Right now it seems to be ""crisis, what crisis ?"""

Keeping the public informed about a virus that has already cropped up in the United States and that could potentially become a pandemic is the media's way to bring down Trump (setting aside the fact that Fox News and Limbaugh, etc. are also the media). If your boss would just do his job, instead of pretending that there's no problem whatsoever, maybe he and you and all of the other swamp creatures in the White House wouldn't be feeling the heat so much.

A Warren G.

2020-02-28 19:34,"Trump has little or no interest in the virus. He regards it as a variant of the common cold, which at worst might produce a few thousand more deaths in the U.S. this year in what remains of the flu season.

The deaths themselves would mean nothing to him.

What matters to him is the stock market because the survival of his Presidency depends on it.

When Trump came along, businesses and many well-to-do people saw a con- artist who would give them lower taxes; was promising to spend lavishly on the military and the infrastructure; had no interest in controlling budget deficits and inflation; would cast a cold eye on the need for health and safety measures in the workplace; and would ignore the effects of climate change.

Well, the chickens have come home to roost; and what he and Americans foolish enough to believe in his methods have succeeded in producing are vastly overheated stock prices that -- to the surprise of no one familiar with the ups and downs of the stock market -- are now collapsing.

The coronavirus is guilty of nothing more than being a virus.

We will survive it.

Trump -- virtually single-handed -- has  succeeded in collapsing the stock market and is clueless on the matter of how to revive
it.

This is why he stays up late at night, tweeting bile throughout
the country."
2020-02-28 19:22,What an outrage that the white house with all the resources at its disposal chooses once again to focus on trump's political fortunes over the well being of average Americans. Trump's incompetence and selfishness in the face of bad news is soaring to new highs.

He has been very fortunate in that not much of anything major has happened, until now. We have the answer: the chaotic, self-aggrandizing and ineffective response we had suspected would be the result of an incompetent, narcissistic individual, acting out of his depth. This administration is uniquely unsuited to handling this."

2020-02-28 19:13,"Actually it’s a world wide response - China’s output is 20% of normal - and as the WH  and Trump like to forget - the world economy is linked to China’s. So yes there is worry about an economic turndown. The WH would know if it had real economic advisors. Rest easy though - Sen. Grassley, Lindsay Graham, and Mitch McConnell also own this so Trump has three scapegoats. And Barron - I understand he and his mother don’t even live in the WH like all previous presidential families. But we do wish him well."
2020-02-28 19:21,"This is so disturbing. We have a novel coronovirus that, from the current data, is 20 times more deadly than the flu and unlike Ebola or MERS is easily transmissible. It could infect a majority of the population. It could be fatal for millions.

And these crazy people think the media coverage is an attack on Trump. It is the biggest story all around the world. All those other countries aren't voting on Trump and he is not the priority. People are worried about their loved ones, their neighbors, themselves, the impact on the economy. And there is a growing frustration that the President and those surrounding him are focused on scoring political points and fighting the media and the election rather than leading us through what could be a very difficult time."
2020-02-28 19:42,"I just texted a friend this morning asking her how Trump will handle a virus and a stock market that is contrary to his will. You can't call either one of them a name like a person.

Now we have our answer: the virus and the stock market are a cleverly planned conspiracy against him."
2020-02-28 19:15,"Only one relevant piece of new here -- Trump believes he only can serve two terms. Of course, that's today. If he is reelected, his ego will  indeed make the virus seem small. By the time four more years are gone, American democracy will be gone as well."

2020-02-28 19:04,"The media isn't reporting about this virus to create a panic, nor are they reporting about it to have an affect on the presidents approval rating. They are reporting because it is news. BIG news that the public not only wants to hear about, but NEED to hear about to stay safe."
2020-02-28 19:34,"I oddly enough find myself agreeing with the liberals, especially their concern that President Trump is too focused on his reelection.

2020-02-28 19:17,"I will argue the opposite, the press have not done enough in terms of awareness from the get go because they were overtly cautious not to raise panic. The Virus is a danger until the gravity is well ascertained and the press have an obligation right now to even heighten the awareness  otherwise it will be a very catastrophic pandemic.  Given a leadership well entrenched in lies, you can't help but wonder when they knew about the gravity of these issue and how far they went to keep a lid on it until the hospital systems are overwhelmed. These administration is a danger to the public.  In their myopic or naivety knowledge of the gravity of the situation, they do not understand the stocks would be worse off if the discovery of the extent of the pandemic is realized late. They should be grateful to the press for informing all even though it is late in my view."
2020-02-28 19:05,"If Mulvaney thinks the press needs to provide more coverage of Trump""s loving relationship with his son, maybe he needs to suggest Trump spend more time with Barron in public. When have we ever seen them engaging in father/son activities? A ball game, a round of golf, a movie? And why oh why do we never see Barron on intl trips?I imagine they would be quite enriching for a kid his age. They aren't  all during school time. You always see his older kids, but never Barron (leading to much speculation about what Barron's problem)."
2020-02-28 19:05,"He should be fired for even suggesting this. Anyone who interferes with open, honest, transparent communication on this hurts the cause of keeping the public informed about the magnitude of the problem.  We really don't need this.  Of course he is following the lead of his boss.  I am scared for my neighbors who are sick if this is the reckless way the administration is communicating."
2020-02-28 19:22,"It's very hard to find anything positive about Trump when it comes to the Coronavirus.  He appoints Mike Pence to head up the government's response to the virus, but politics is immediately injected into the fray when he says the drop in the stock market is the Democrats' fault (or was that another one of Trump's jokes we all missed?) and all statements from the CDC et alia have to be vetted by Pence (surely not for medical accuracy!) before they can be given to the public.  To paraphrase Mr. Muivaney: ""Of course this is political; get over it!""

As for talking about his relationship with his son Barron, I'm curious: Does ANYONE in Fox talk about their relationship?  I hope not; Melania's wishes should be respected, and they are, as far as the ""liberal"" newspapers and media outlets to which I listen."

I am grateful to have a physician who is being proactive and is reaching out to his clients to assure them that he and his staff are and will continue to be available in any capacity necessary.  

But shouldn't a similar kind of reassurance be coming from the president and his staff?

All those guys accomplish is creating more fear and uncertainty because they care more about Trump and the American citizen.

2020-02-28 19:01,"A strong leader would not blame transparency, but instead would lead the country and world with a proactive plan and a constant communication of facts.

He is evasive and he lies (the evidence on this latter point is well documented). These are not things that inspire public confidence in the face of a global pandemic.  Then you add the fact that most individuals who are working in public health are altruistic people who lean left of center (it is not a field that attracts rigid, authoritarian personalities) and you have the makings of the perfect storm."
2020-02-28 19:44,"I hear people are saying that this is a golden opportunity for Republicans if the situation gets bad in the US.  The plan is, for public safety, for Trump to declare a national emergency and cancel the 2020 elections.  Mulvaney's comments add credence to this idea.  Muzzling the spokespeople from the CDC is just part of the plan.  Be afraid, be very afraid."
2020-02-28 19:14,"The stock market is dropping because the top 10% and investment companies are trying to unload their stocks. Many small individual investors have lost  their savings in this collapse as they wait in line to sell as their call margins are called. Up till now this market collapse may not be a result of economic conditions, but about irrational fear. The media is only reporting this fear, not causing it. Lack of leadership by the republican administration in Washington is the cause."

Assuming that there could be 10 million cases of coronavirus over the next year with a case fatality rate of 3%, we would be looking at 300,000 deaths. The infection rate for influenza is 1.3 but 4 for this virus and so we may anticipate more than a minimum. The could mean 500,000 to 1 million deaths. 

This is why the press is reporting this issue. It has nothing to do with Trump except for the fact that this presents another dot in the picture of incompetence."

2020-02-28 19:51,"Mr. Mulvaney, I’m confused: What do you mean by “the” and “is”? How do you think the all-profession collusion of “they” happens? 

Of COURSE, it’s silly to give time to rhetoric of The Paranoid Style in political marketing (other than objective reporting)—unless one might be interested in diagnosing The Demonization Style that is ultimately pathetic. 

But the alleged “Conservative” (who missed the memo on decency, integrity, and authenticity) entertains Trumpist pathology for godknows what reason that’s not diabolical avarice for tribal power.

The real mystery is why insulting the intelligence of an audience rallies the insulted, i.e., that Trump is considered likely to be re-elected. 

Is “red state” journalistic opinion actually acting like a consolidated counter-“they” that willfully “is”? 

Why?—given that Trumpism has brought no benefit to any Republican stronghold other than to bolster strongholding for its own sake, like authoritarian parenting.

Is THAT the problem?: a last stand of the authoritarian family in the sunset of THE reality that IS?: an entire “presidency” that was accidental, now de-clothed by serious need for leadership.

Not enough cauliflower in the mashed potatoes, I guess. Maybe that’s a doctor’s signal that the golf club king is soon to retire permanently to a miniature green."

2020-02-28 20:00,"“The reason you’re seeing so much attention to it today is that they think this is going to be the thing that brings down the president,” he added. “That’s what this is all about it.”

No, Mr. Mulvaney, the president himself and the irresponsible people he surrounds himself with such as yourself are the thing that are going to being him down. How has Trump dealt with this? Well, he cut funding to the CDC, and he got rid of the pandemic agency set up under Obama  in 2014 when the ebola virus broke out. (It wasn’t well funded, but it was Obama’s program.) He is intent on punishing any whisteblowers, such as the Department of Health and Human Services worker who alleged that the Trump administration, without providing adequate medical training or protective equipment, sent more than a dozen federal workers to two military bases in California to help process Americans evacuees from Wuhan, China. And he has put Mike Pence, who is anti science, in charge of dealing with the crisis. While panic spreads and concerns about preparedness increase, Trump is not worried about anything but himself and how the plunging stock market will effect his standing.  Trump has taken all the credit for the stock market doing well, but now, you are all running and hiding for cover, and this is all a plot being brought on by the media and the democrats."

No, this is about a rapidly escalating global health crisis requiring an international response led by the world's largest superpower. And yet, the President of said superpower and his administration are exclusively focused on positioning themselves as the real victims of the crisis and hoping that doing so will help him politically."
2020-02-28 19:52,"What ""media"" is he talking about?  The media that underplays the risks because it exposes conservative myths around Trump's economic prowess or the media that feeds conservative racist xenophobia with calls for 'quarantine' as a long-term immigration policy.

Without coverage by the American Free Press, the public would have no ideal about the spread of Covid-19 throughout the world. The media has given Americans insight into how the virus has impacted China, and how bad it could get here. 

Perhaps, Mulvaney would prefer for the people to sit passively and wait for the Trump Administration to spout out a sanitized version of events related to spread of the virus.  By now, it is obvious all we can expect from this administration is coverup, disinformation and propaganda."

In fact, it is Trump who has brought the American people down by gutting the CDC and other government agencies. 
Donald Trump has NEVER cared about protecting anyone other than himself.  
It’s as though he has set us up for this on the day he declared his candidacy.

We pay for these experts and cannot acquiesce to this. A ""steady drumbeat"" demanding direct communication from professionals is warranted.  If your elected officials are Republicans, all the better."

Trump can dish it out but is outraged when anything is aimed at him and apparently the Democrats can't resist the opportunity to pile on regardless of the consequences.

Welcome to ""interesting times""."

Mulveyney’s statement was as dangerous as it was inaccurate. Trump is more concerned about he is perceived in the media than actually doing something about the COVID outbreak. 

Trump defunded the CDC, is attempting to silence scientists, and appointed a science denier with a poor track record in virus containment to head the virus task force.

Stop the lies - Do something meaningful"

2020-02-28 20:03,"Here is the clearest difference in how this soon to be pandemic would have been handled by our previous administration and this faux administration is simple.

President Obama would have provided clear direction and evidence-based guidelines for handling. President Obama created a special ancillary Department to handle just what is occurring now!

The Dolt and faux administration accuses the media, Democrats, and the rest of the world without providing anything but accusations and fear mongering. Then, to cut funding to CDC and NIH while eliminating the department that President Obama created to coordinate our response to this is so telling!

There was a crack team, previously on the ready, disbanded because the originator is a political enemy.

What’s to be concerned about?"
2020-02-28 19:58,"One reason this story is so weird is that Mulvaney refers to Trump frequently calling his son Barron.  It's widely known that Barron does not live at the White House, but in a suburban home that Melania bought near his school where her parents live with him and where she spends most of her time.  So even if the ""biased media"" wanted to write about the president's relationship with his youngest son, the only time they see him is when he gets on and off airplanes and helicopters with Donald -- and he often hangs back and gets off well after his dad.  That's why Trump has to call his son, he actually does not see him all that often in person."

Substantive action, planning, communication, and science based reporting are needed."
2020-02-28 19:55,"The Spanish Flu killed 40 to 50 million people in the early 1900s, so saying ""it's just the flu"" is a ridiculous statement coming out of the White House.  The president doesn't seem to realize that the reaction he's getting is because of his ""there there"" attitude, and his desire to control the flow of information about something all Americans should be aware of.   

Likely health officials will help contain the virus in ways they couldn't during the early 1900s, but that will only happen through honest discussion of the illness itself, and not any discussion about the president's son."

If we face a global pandemic, don’t we want treatments administered to all citizens and not just a lucky few? The Sanders fear-mongering is falling on deaf ears because most Americans do see the inherent unfairness in our current health care system and are more than willing to change it."
2020-02-28 20:10,"When we see Mulvany, or Trump Jr. on Fox, essentially accusing Democrats of _wanting_ the COVID-19 epidemic to be damaging, we should recognize something. This is not simply their being ""too political"" or ""hyperbolic"". Rather, they are projecting what _they_ would feel if the roles were reversed onto Democrats. So, when a Democratic leader criticizes the Trump administration for having cut funding for epidemic prevention, gutted public health funding, or responding too slowly, they interpret this in light of their own political instincts, in which all political statements are only and exclusively about ""who's winning"", and trying to make the ""other side look bad.""

It simply doesn't occur to them that a political leaders would actually care about the actual world, I fear."

What the population wants (and this goes across party lines) is good concrete information. Information on what the government is actually doing, what the government is doing for the future, and information on what they can do now to prevent getting or minimize the effects of the virus. We are asking for concrete information from credible and trustworthy sources. We are asking for concrete action. 
But the administration is not doing that. We are getting generalized and/ or misleading statements with very little factual and explicit information. Instead we hear from the Administration of complaints about news media reporting and market reaction to the virus from this administration. 
We are getting press releases and information, not from credible experts, but from the Chief of Staff, the President, and the Vice President. All highly political people. 
If the administration really wanted good PR they'd do their job and give us the information we need without worrying about the 'spin'. 
As they say 'Actions speak louder than words.'"

Even stock market investors have it in for him.  They know there is nothing to worry about, yet they are pretending to panic and are willing to lose gobs of money so they can crash the dow and destroy him.

Now the head of the WHO says this is very serious.

And the Fed Chair is in on it.

this is not the work of a deep state, but a deep world.  It is shocking what they will do to crucify our savior."
2020-02-28 20:25,"The blame does not belong with the media, even though much of the news does lean toward the hysterical. It belongs with the president, who has failed to address the epidemic coherently. We can not expect any leadership from this sadly unfocused, incoherent man."

“You’re thinking that this is going to be the thing that brings down the president; that’s what this is all about.”

2020-02-28 20:27,"On Trump's orders Americans were flown back to the U.S. mixing sick and well together on the same plane.  Then, again on Trump's specific orders, people greeting the folks on that plane were not given personal protective gear or the training not to become infected themselves and then they were SENT HOME.  A few days later, a few miles away the first ""community infection"" in the U.S. occurred.  To my mind Trump is PERSONALLY responsible for the outbreak of the novel Coronavirus into the general population.  His extreme ignorance and hubris caused him to overrule the experts yet again.  Only this time there will be many, many deaths to show for it.  Mick Mulvaney needs to shut up and quit spinning.  Trump owns this outcome because it's his personal fault.  But, as is usual whenever Trump is involved, it will be everyone else who really pays the cost.  I wonder if they'll STILL stand by him when their children are desperately sick or worse?"
2020-02-28 20:30,"Trump despite what he says is not the center of the world as the conona virus, a natural, though dangerous agent, shows us.  Trump  is the President of the united States, our servant, but acts like a monarch.  The media pays attention to him as someone we hope knows what he is doing and when he does not should point this out as is their function.  FOX news as his agent will make excuses for him, but are not news in any sense of the word.  Trump as an incompetent brings himself down and the media can not be blamed for it."

2020-02-28 20:33,"Many others here have commented on the numerous bizarre aspects of Mulvaney's speech, so I'll just mention this one, which is minor but still weird enough to make me read it twice:

""“He’s huge, but he’s still very young,” Mr. Mulvaney said of Barron ...""

What does that even mean?!  That Barron is a great presence, deserving of media attention?  Or that Barron is physically large, and due to get larger as he grows up?"
2020-02-28 20:34,"Is there any normal person in the Republican Party?  Is there any reasonable person in the Party?

Mulvaney is nothing more than a paid political liar.  Now I guess we all must have an interest in Barron.  I am all for leaving the kid alone and all the Trumps for that matter.

Trump tells us all will be better in April. A miracle of sorts I guess.  Rush Limbaugh tells us just a version of the flu not a problem.

Republicans couldn't figure out Katrina and they are not going to do well here.  They simply don't care."
2020-02-28 20:35,Trump and his cronies will grasp at anything to try and prop him up. Next the paranoids will claim that the Democrats created the epidemic. Perhaps it was the Russians or Ukraine.

Have we no pity for the poor victimized president?

2020-02-28 20:19,"Should Trump, as seems likely, continue to display ignorance and incompetence as he has done since January 2017, he will bring himself down.  Of particular concern is whether the immigrants detained at the border will be protected to the extent possible from the epidemic.  Their situation is already unhealthy, and they are at great risk now that COVID-9 cases have appeared in Mexico.  Trump never did help Puerto Rico after 2 hurricanes and an earthquake.  He could atone for some of the cruelty of his policies by doing whatever is feasible to help the detainees at the robrder."
2020-02-28 20:22,Does Trump need the help? Finally we face a crisis not of his making and the courtiers are out finding others to blame. Mark this as a new low in our political life.

2020-02-28 20:31,"He really has some nerve, saying ""I've only got eight years"" as if a win this November is anywhere close to a sure thing. But I guess we knew that about him already. Perhaps he's speaking to the possibility (as Bill Maher and others have suggested) that he may not leave without a fight regardless of the will of the people. I may not have the utmost faith in my country's current leadership (and have even less at the provincial level), but seeing the manner in which Trump is ""dealing with"" the coronavirus threat is just giving me one more reason to thank my lucky stars that I live north of the border, and am not a constituent of the narcissistic sociopath that has infiltrated your Oval Office. It is horrific to think that his incorrigible selfishness and disdain for public safety might actually result in countless completely preventable deaths - and that so few congressional Republicans seem to be concerned at this point."
2020-02-28 20:15,"The only thing that I heard from Trump's coronavirus public address was: 1) him patting himself on the back for his prescient and full response (a beautiful response) to the outbreak, 2) a weak whataboutism concerning the comparative greater impact of the flu, and 3) attaboys for Mike Pence, Xi Jinping, and the loads of US medical experts who'd better keep their mouths shut if they know what's good for them.  He didn't give a single fact or an outlines on the state of preparedness/containment plan.  What is it that we are supposed to think and do now?   Pray and vote Trump in 2020?  Not exactly strong medicine."

Ask any pediatrician  about infants with bad colds progressing into bad pneumonia, turning positive for coronavirus. Many of these babies ended up intubated with long recovery periods. Og, one more thing- these infections were not limited to winter months.
Thus, any reasonable person would pay attention to what infectious disease specialists, epidemiologists and public health staff instruct and issue warnings about.
This particular administration comprises of self serving, dogmatic and arrogant individuals right at this moment concerned only and exclusively about their safety and benefits.
The rest of us - all 330 + million Americans- are left to our own devices: frequent handwashing, avoiding public places and public gatherings, following news from the CDC and voting the ignorant gnats out comes November."

To listen to the Conservatives at that time you'd think that President Obama's reaction to Ebola was going to sicken everyone in Our Country.

Well perhaps if there were weekly press briefings like previous administrations held, the country would have been made aware of this ""rare public health emergency.""

I have to be honest.  This is the first time I knew any such emergency was declared by Trump's administration."
2020-02-28 20:33,"The global market does not like uncertainty.  We don't know where cases of this virus will pop up, how virulent it will be among particular populations, how quickly it will spread in a population and whether or not our public health system can test people quickly enough or be able to quarantine those exposed to it.  I would hope Mr. Mulvaney could just stop blaming a political party, and be more on the side of getting accurate information out to the populace."
2020-02-28 20:35,I hear Trump policies being supported but I do not hear anyone condoning Trump's personal behavior.  Mulvaney apparently sees this also as it appears to be his motivation for urging the Press to cover Trump and his son's relationship - an example astutely questioned by the author but perhaps it is the only one Mulvaney knows of.
2020-02-28 20:36,"It is in these times of crisis, like covid 19, when the credibility of those in charge plays a most important role in the anxiety level of the populous. Except for the hardened core of Trump supporters, people have come to accept that this president plays it free and loose when it comes to the facts. Most people understand that this president has little respect for science based decision making. His treatment and outright dismissal of the scientific community within his own administration leaves gapping holes in our ability to respond. Mr. Trump and his crew have frittered away and discarded the credibility of his office."
2020-02-28 20:25,"It is always, always all about Trump. At least in his mind. The whole world is grappling with a potential disaster and he is campaigning -- while unopposed for his party's nomination -- for November. Good grief. And I do mean grief."
2020-02-28 20:38,"This administration will lock down medical personnel at CDC and NIH because the president 's main concern is that he may not get re-elected, then its the obligation of Nancy Pelosi and other Democrats to speak to officials at CDC/NIH EVERY day and hold a daily news conference to report to Ameican citizens. Trump can't fire Pelosi or Democratic senators or keep them quiet.  
If Trump supporters will make light of this issue than they will suffer in larger numbers. Oh well."

Over 50 voyages have been cancelled since late January.  The Port of Los Angeles has reported a drop in container volumes of over 25%. The slowdown of Chinese exports has effectively removed over 350,000 40-foot containers from global trade.  The shortage of inbound containers has left U.S. exporters unable to acquire equipment for outbound shipments.  A domino effect."
2020-02-28 20:17,"The fact that the Trump administration cut funding and closed offices is unfortunate, but neither is it the cause of our current situation.  It is not about what the administration did or didn't do.  It is about what the administration is doing and will do.  That said, it is beyond appalling that this entire situation has been so completely politicized.  Someone has got to stand up and be the leader.  That is Mr. Trump's responsibility.  And leadership, especially in this case, requires honesty. So, let's take a look at Mr. Mulvaney's comments.  An honest answer would be to say that from what we know now this is more deadly than the flu and less deadly  than Ebola.   Our objective is to learn more quickly and then take appropriate action.    All sides need to focus on the facts and forget the politics."

In all my life I have not had the grace to hear so many imbeciles all quacking in chorus in the US government. And I have lived for a long time. 

Shame on Mueller, shame on John Roberts and shame on Comey who precipitated this whole mess we are in. No point in calling Mitch McConnell names, he is beyond that.

• Based on the below, it’s a circuitous argument.  If the media HAD given coronavirus “so much attention” back then, he’d simply claim the same thing - it was only to “bring down the president”.
• It also seems to this reader that Mulvaney’s trying to fixate on HOW “much attention” it’s receiving.
• Finally, how does any of this explain the heavy coverage here in Australia or in Japan or in <>??

But Mr. Mulvaney claimed that the news media was too preoccupied covering impeachment, he said, “because they thought it would bring down the president.”
The media’s focus switched to the coronavirus for the same reason, he continued.
“The reason you’re seeing so much attention to it today is that they think this is going to be the thing that brings down the president,” he added. “That’s what this is all about it.”"

2020-02-28 16:02,Trump didn’t sleep because of his obsession with Fox News and his practice of nocturnal tweeting.
2020-02-28 16:26,"Is he saying that the deaths of American citizens is not important?  And I had thought that Melania had made is very very clear that Barron was off limits.  As he should be, he is very young.  The press is treating him much better than the Obama girls.  And what a piece of work to tell us that we as citizens are not important. This cretin is not someone I would want in the White House.  He has some very unbalanced views and seems to be able to justify anything.  We the people are not against him, he is against us."

When they tout their successes, they gloat and preen. When they protest against journalism, they whine in self-pity. Neither is becoming of a POTUS."
2020-02-28 19:31,"And stilll they persisted.  (Judas!  The men that are in it)      hey, trump and company.  This is not a conspiracy theory.  It is not a hoax.  It is a virus for which preparedness is the key.  It is about people.  You remember -we are the us in US.  Stop with the election and stock market focus.   This virus is recognized.  Tell ""We, the people"" those actions which are necessary and keep us updated.  We can r4ad the CDC website.  We can read the news of the last two months.   This is a virus which has gone around the globe.  We have been told to wash our hands.  All the time.  If we hae a cold or a cough, wear a mask to eliminate spreading those droplets which are annoying.  Not feeling well.  Stay home. What we hear is about you, 45, you and you and you.     Your election.  Your stock market hoopla.   And then your spin-meisters bring in Ebola!  Tbis administration is beyond craven and complicit.   They are certifiable.   Definitely straight-jacket applicants.  Once this government had specialists at every turn.  People with experience.  A banquet of informed and intelligent people who were available to collect information and present it in a rational, clear manner.   People and agencies to whom a president would seek for advice.   Ha!  We have trump and friends.  All scurrying to bolster and support and shore-up this leaky person.  Suits and ties and shiny shoes do not mean squat."
2020-02-28 19:44,I have no doubt that Mulvaney’s spouting gibberish about what a nice father Trump is was the result of a direct order from Trump.

2020-02-28 20:20,How about those Trump administration officials stand up on Fox and show themselves es getting a flu shot. Or immunizing their kids against measles. The shots  will not prevent the Covfefe virus. It will however help to keep down the use of the ER room from other problems.
2020-02-28 17:06,"Yes, Mulvaney, because it’s all about Trump, you sniveling sycophant. We have a President who regularly tweets conspiracy theories and a Vice President who doesn’t believe smoking kills people. Why would we believe a word they say? As usual, we’ll work around these nitwits and look out for ourselves. But it would be so fitting if it was the Stock Market drop that brought Trump down. Hello Karma my old friend..."

Anybody actually believing this stuff?!"
2020-02-28 17:56,"Just a few days ago, Mulvaney was a darling of the NYT because his comments differed from our President.

Now, he is a full loyalist.

Hey, keep trying, as we know you will - to try and have our President removed from office. The NYT, CNN, MSNBC, NBC et al have given up any objectivity and have all agreed to kowtow to the Leftists and allowed themselves to be weaponized against our President.

Mulvaney is correct - with the panic of the coronavirus setting in (propelled by the press), the Left believes it has an opportunity to politicize this epidemic (and the accompanying stock market slide) for its desire to remove our President.

But hey, people dying and people losing value in their retirement funds, shouldn't matter, right? All that matters is getting rid of Trump.

It won't work. Our President will be reelected. And the Dems know this."

2020-02-28 16:26,Mr. Mulvaney: Maybe the Bidens should be investigated to see if they had anything to do with the creation of this virus.

2020-02-28 16:43,Typical Trump. Millions of people are understandably concerned about getting sick from the Coronavirus and all Trump is concerned about is that it may take off some of the “glow” from what he claims are his administration’s accomplishments.
2020-02-28 17:38,"Hopefully, when the President and Vice President catch the coronavirus they'll see that it's no big deal after all. Then President Pelosi will be able to at least fund the CDC & NIH...."

Trump said he was wrong. 

Once again, Trump makes up answers to things he knows nothing about.

Not Pence or the CDC or anyone else."

2020-02-28 20:20,"Mike Mulvaney:  It is outrageous that you would attempt to undermine the actual state of a global health crisis with an irresponsible statement making this about media attempting to bring down Donald Trump.  Preposterous and appallingly disgraceful...this is deliberate disinformation and descemination of a false narrative while credible and highly credentialed science professionals state otherwise. 
Here is the truth from the World Health Organization today:
""The World Health Organization has raised its assessment of the global coronavirus risk from “high” to “very high,” the most serious assessment in its new four-stage alert system.""
“This is a reality check for every government on the planet,” said Dr. Michael J. Ryan, deputy director of W.H.O.’s health emergency program.  
I will believe Dr. Michael Ryan over anything the Trump Administration has to say. And I would suggest those who want the truth about this health emergency ignore Trump and pay attention to Dr. Ryan and others who are professionally trained in infectious diseases."

Second Mr Mercer, the man who finds Breitbart, helped invent computerized trading. I’m pretty sure his algorithms don’t use google. 
Lastly does anyone believe that the remaining Wall Street traders are anything other than Republicans?
Just Republican talking points mimicking the stable genius of Donald Trump saying “look over there” instead of managing the largest health crisis since AIDS. Thank God someone had the intelligence to appoint the Ambassador Birx to do the real work."

Science matters. I know you don’t read. I know your Base doesn’t read. I know Republicans, in general, are incapable of understanding science, and how our world actually works.

And, yes, you can turn a blind eye towards Climate Change.

But you cannot ignore a pandemic. Especially if climate change will make the pandemic worse!

My advice? Listen to the scientists. Listen to anyone who has an education past Grade School. Listen to the CDC. 

Sincerely,
Those of us who know better 

p.s. and stop cutting the budget of an Organization that you know nothing about."
2020-02-28 17:15,"Covid-19 doesn’t care about Mick Mulvaney.

Covid-19 doesn’t care about Trump’s tweets.

Covid-19 doesn’t care about Fox News.

Trump is helpless against Covid-19. Only luck can save him.

Only truth and science is any defense against Covid-19. Trump hates truth and science.

2020-02-28 16:58,At least Nero was playing the fiddle while Rome was burning. Trump and his administration are busy blaming everybody else for their incompetence.

2020-02-28 18:47,"Thanks, Mulvaney. I will try to take your advice and focus on Trump's loving relationship with his son, Barron. 

Remember when Trump was discussing vaping recently, and he said that his wife, Melania, has a son? Mike, are you talking about that son?"
2020-02-28 19:22,"No one needs to bring down our corrupt and unintelligent president.  He's doing a fine job on his own.

This virus is serious business and this Keystone Cops administration isn't handling it well.  

To think a miracle will make the virus vanish is the height of stupidity and misinformation.  To appoint VP Pence to oversee everything, when all they want to do is to suppress information and make the public think there's nothing to fear, is exactly what we expect from these abominable people.

If one person dies in the very near future from this virus in our country, we know to leave the responsibility for this at the corrupt man's door."
2020-02-28 20:09,"“It’s not a death sentence” ?  Unless you actually die from it. I think Mulvaney might want to read the news. If he can’t bring himself to do that, maybe he can check out the CDC’s website to learn something about this virus."

2020-02-28 15:56,"The mind boggles at the ignorance, arrogance, irresponsibility and audacity of the Trump maladministration. 

Despite what Trump may think, not everything is about him.

Trump is completely incapable of dealing with a crisis such as this. He knows it too, which is why he has set Pence up as his fall guy. 

November can't come soon enough. The United States and the world need to be rid of the scourge of Donald J Trump and his cronies."
2020-02-28 16:57,"Mulvaney would likely claim that world news also is looking to take Trump down. Only the dictatorship of China is reporting that all is well because of Xi's leadership. I guess Mulvaney would say that that's ""real"" news. It appears that (political) prostitution is legal in D.C."
2020-02-28 17:08,"Does no one in this WH believe in public service? 

Mulvaney is accusing Democrats of fear-mongering now. Let’s rewind the tape: Trump tweeted in 2018 that Democrats wanted “Open Borders”, which “brings large-scale crime and disease”, to stoke racist anger towards desperate Latinos. Then it was Trump who was enraged when he learned from Fox News that coronavirus patients had been returned to the US. 

Also, Trump was grasping a brightly-colored map at his press conference that had been grabbed off the internet by someone, obviously to help him remember that America is better prepared than any other country in the world to deal with the “caronavirus”. That is how much people in the WH care about getting accurate info about this crisis to the public and their great leader."

2020-02-28 20:14,"So reading between the lines.... Trump has no relationship with his son and most definitely spent the morning before the press conference and the overnight on the plane asleep. And oh, there is definitely no plan for dealing with the coronavirus.

The question for the American people is whether they want to continue to support mindlessly this president  before the unavoidable effects of the coming pandemic wipe us out. It's not about the democrats or the Trump haters, it's about a feckless dimwitted incompetent at the wheel. Heckuva job, Mick, Pence and Trumpy."

In over-simple terms..stock valuations are conjectures, based on real or perceived (often fuzzy) future earnings potential. They're highly changeable, especially when something as REAL as a global supply chain disruption occurs.

They are actually trying to ""spin"" a virus. What's next, that the earth is flat?

What I find most appalling is that the White House has issued an order that every TV appearance by any government health-official has to be ""cleared"" with Mike Pence. That's China, or the USSR, but not the United States!

I just did a quick calculation and concluded that - if every U.S. citizen would be infected - the death toll would stand at roughly 6 to 9 millions. Someone in government should have to answer for that, don't you think?

But - as usual - Trump will get away with this, even if he loses in November. He will blame it on the next guy/girl, or the Dems in general, or bad luck, or (as seen here) ""The Media"". 

This guy is unbelievable, even P. T. Barnum would be amazed! I hope America learns something from the Trump-mistake of 2016..."

Everything that happens in the world has to be seen through Trump's paranoid, hyper-competitive lens.  Even a global pandemic is a cause for him to lash out and seek enemies, instead of allies to cooperate with.

Hopefully the President's own psychological limitations won't affect the government's response to this crisis.  But given past perfomances -- Hurricane Maria, Sharpie-gate, etc. -- we shouldn't underestimate the ability of Mr. Trump and his yes-men to inappropriately politicize non-political events.

2020-02-28 19:01,"Disgraceful.  This administration is placing Trump's re-election chances far, far above the health and safety of the American people.  Trump's constant lying, his war on experts and science, and his obsession with protecting his campaign and the markets make him the worst possible president for this moment.  This has the makings of a perfect storm."
2020-02-28 19:17,"Blaming the media is insane, but this is the only go-to move for this administration. I truly would not be surprised if a) Mulvaney comes down with the coronavirus, and b) blames the media for coming down with the coronavirus. Truly remarkable stuff."

2020-02-28 19:01,"Mulvaney is talking nonsense. It’s not even a good distraction. But with Trump and his ... whatever they’re called ... this isn’t unexpected. The longer this administration goes on, the worse it gets for them in terms of credibility ... at least with anyone paying attention."
2020-02-28 19:31,"More than 83,000 people in at least 56 countries have been infected with more than 2800 deaths reported.

These people aren't just incompetent, they're crazy as he is."
2020-02-28 19:42,GOP it’s not to late to save yourselves. Get rid of trump before the party is gone forever.  This financial collapse has nothing to do with the virus.

2020-02-28 19:21,"A review of Trump's 2014 tweets reveals several comments about Ebola. Essentially, Trump exploited the disease for personal political gain, going so far as to call Obama ""psycho"" for not canceling all flights to USA from countries struggling with Ebola cases. 
In light of this information, Mulvaney's comments are disingenuous at best."
2020-02-28 19:26,What if it's not just the media?  What if the actual virus itself is anti-Trump?
2020-02-28 19:55,"Somehow I doubt in Germany, Merkel's staff is proclaiming the opposition is using COVID-19 to halt Angela. Only Trump's dotards are standing in front of ""believers"" and spouting this nonsense while ignoring actual beneficial actions that could be happening as they try to cast pre-disaster blame. So sad."
2020-02-28 20:20,"""He [Mulvaney] said Mr. Trump is in frequent contact with his youngest son, calling to check in on him and let him know of his whereabouts.""

Mick: It's great that the president calls and is in frequent contact with Barron. You're right, the press should be covering this -- ""The president called his son, Barron today, to say, 'Barron? This is your father, President Trump. I'm in the next room. Bye.''' I mean, it's not like they live in the same house."
2020-02-28 20:26,"Shame on Mike Mulvaney. Shame on Donald Trump. Shame on the enabling Republican Party. They have conspired together to wreak havoc on the critical infrastructure and the values that truly ""Make America Great"". Their war on fact, truth and science has led to fear, chaos and the unraveling of the world geopolitical and economic order. Dismantling and muzzling the public health programs that keep America safe is criminal. The tumbling markets are but a reflection of stumbling incompetence."
2020-02-28 20:41,"It's clear that Mr. Trump and his entire staff are not taking this threat seriously.  They are only concerned about the politics and the stock market. We are badly unprepared. And, Mr. Trump's lies and cover-up only make it worse."
2020-02-28 20:41,We can only hope it helps bring him down. He should have been removed by the Senate. He and his flunkies have a lot to answer for.
2020-02-28 19:08,"Rush Limbaugh hasn't  offered  his  version of  story.

He most likely will come up something like this. 

China  for retaliation to Trump Tariffs , created the virus. 

We become very petulant, very pitiful."
2020-02-28 19:45,So the media is over-covering coronavirus and is under-covering Barron Trump. Makes perfect sense in bizzaro world.
2020-02-28 20:19,"There are not enough words to express the outrage I feel. This global emergency has nothing, NOTHING to do with bringing down the president. Instead it could have everything to do with saving lives. But Trump and his cronies can think of nothing other than their self-importance. Shameful."

2020-02-28 20:00,Fauci should be in charge of this!  He's smart and duh he's a doctor and highly respected.  Why should HE be muzzled by Pence???
2020-02-28 20:33,"I argue that the White House chief of staff is endangering every American by not following the tide in every legitimate federal and state governmental agency preparing for the corona virus. Heck, for the first time in memory, Costco is wiping down every shopping cart wheeled in by a customer. At least some parts of our economy are being responsible corporate citizens, Mr. Mulvaney."
2020-02-28 17:21,"We are good ,Emperor Tump has appointed  our almost invisible Vice President Pence to head all matters of concern with the outbreak of this virus. He has zero training in such matters.
Who wrote this script?"
2020-02-28 19:10,"Why are more people not commenting on the last graf of this story? Trump reportedly said to Mulvaney:

‘I’ve only got eight years, I’m going to get as much out of it as I can.""

My God, this man is vile."

2020-02-28 15:50,"Mick Mulvaney is doing a very good impression of Captain Queeg. 

Even in the face of an apolitical stock market voting with their trades, Queeg Mulvaney continues to engage in paranoid ramblings. 

Each and every American should send a subtle message to Mulvaney and mail him a pair of ball bearings he can roll around in the palm of his hand a as feigns outrage at his latest imaginary conspiracy."
2020-02-28 17:27,The next thing we'll hear is Trump blaming illegal immigrants and the Obama administration for the spread of the coronavirus nationwide.

2020-02-28 20:40,"Mick thinks the virus is a Democrat. Meanwhile, markets are getting crushed and Mick has no clue why. WHO has the pandemic alert on full, and Mick asks why? Stick to politics Mick."
2020-02-28 16:45,Mulvaney is throwing meat to the press in the form of Trump's poor son. Anything to deflect from the real story which is incompetence and dishonetsy

2020-02-28 18:03,"I’ve never seen a whinier group of grown men and women than the fools

2020-02-28 19:04,"Gee, Mick. cutting the CDC budget last year might be hampering this year's production of those virus test kits, huh?
And disbanding the global pandemic team at national security?
No science necessary here. It's all a hoax.
Maybe you should follow your evangelical political base and just PRAY.
While you are at it, you can pray for an increase in taxes on the rich to pay for food shelter and medicine for the poor which is what Jesus preached over and over again. Help the poor. Read the good book. Don't be a hypocrite."
2020-02-28 19:40,"Maybe Mike Pompeo can yell and scream, then pull out his magical, blank map to show us just where the Corona virus has spread..."
2020-02-28 19:59,"Get over yourself, Mick. The president is bringing himself down-- without any outside help."
2020-02-28 19:10,An administration more interested in propaganda than prevention!
2020-02-28 19:49,Somebody please tell these wackos that this is not about Trump. This is a crisis with capital C. Think about AMERICA. Think about human beings.
2020-02-28 15:58,Always the victim.
2020-02-28 16:38,"Mr. Mulvaney said, “... the press wants him (the president) to be this terrible monster.”

Correction, he is a terrible person..."

2020-02-28 17:59,"How despicable. One assumes that the Trump Administration does this because they know there's a core of credulous cretins in Trumpland, who will swallow pretty much anything that Trump's organization says. The lack of empathy and consideration for the real situation and its cost to the nation, however, is astounding.

Those chickens will be coming home to roost, however. Big, drooling infectious chickens. Look out, Donnie!"
2020-02-28 20:53,"Dear Mulvaney, impeached president trump is doing that all by himself."
2020-02-28 20:54,That’s what happens when you’re a viral tweeter.
2020-02-28 16:18,The only one who will bring Trump down during this Coronavirus crisis is Trump himself. How ridiculous.
2020-02-28 19:18,"Trump's craven self absorption during this health crisis may finally lay bare his true feeling of the American people, and it may very well be his Waterloo. Unfortunately, it may mean we pay dearly in order to finally rid ourselves of this foolish, unqualified, unmitigated disaster of a president."
2020-02-28 16:43,"You just have to laugh at all the idiocy spewed forth by the Trump Toadies!

Trump didn't sleep on the plane back from India because he doesn't want to waste a minute of his 8 years as President??? Yes, that is why he spends most of his time watching TV, tweeting nonsense and golfing.

Bless your heart Mulvaney!"
2020-02-28 19:21,"""Bring down the President ""????? He's certifiable for saying that. Ridiculously irresponsible."
2020-02-28 20:01,The Trump administration wants the American people to swallow whole their bald-faced lies and excuses for being ill-prepared for this pandemic.
2020-02-28 15:50,"Imagine a White House official complaining that the media are not doing enough to write stories about a child of the president. 

Will nothing rid us of this terrible administration?"
2020-02-28 19:42,The media is not using COVID-19 to bring down the president - it's just a possible side effect.
2020-02-28 20:05,"Did Mulvaney just give tabloids, magazines, tv gossip shows, and all the rest permission to cover the life of Barron Trump?"
2020-02-28 16:51,"This is what happens when a person lives on lies.  It always comes back and gets you where it hurts.  It wasn’t the sexual harassment charges, it wasn’t the racist comments or the perfect phone call that lead to impeachment from the House. It’s the Coronavirus that will get to Trump.  This guy has no control over the situation and it’s eating him up.   Goes to show that the emperor has No Clothes!"
2020-02-28 17:25,"Instead of assurances of help, Trump can only see the world from the lens of his  paranoid delusional narcissism that it's all a conspiracy against ME. He now has his loyalists like Mick Mulvaney sharing his grievance about a media plot or conspiracy or coup.  If ever you needed evidence that we have a mentally sick person in The Oval Office who is totally unable to think beyond the end of his nose and protect others who may actually die, this is it! And all this does, of course, is further spook the market."
2020-02-28 17:29,"Like all who hope to Make America Great Again as it was before our Liar In Chief assumed the throne, I'm all for anything that takes Trump down.  Of course, this childish claim from a mindless Trump disciple is nonsense.  It belongs in the Entertainment Section with other amusements."
2020-02-28 17:35,"Amazing that Trump patterns the administration response after what the Chinese are doing.  

Trump prove that in the end he prefers the totalitarian approach- over all it is a much easier way to govern.  You don't need to persuade others about your position, you mostly think about yourself or the regime you head and you don't need to trust others or more importantly the people you govern.    You save a lot of time by not gathering facts and information and analyzing it.  

This frees up a lot of time for golf and watching Fox News."
2020-02-28 18:31,GIVE ME A BREAK. When is administration stop playing the role of victim and actually lead???
2020-02-28 18:46,"Simply abhorrent and unacceptable that we are subjected to the lies, deflections and ignorant placating by the likes of Mulvaney, Pence and Trump himself. Accurate information and truthful assessments delivered by legitimate medical personnel will serve to diminish somewhat  the fears, erroneous information and anxiety that is sure to intensify given the seriousness of this virus. We need not hear from unqualified political hacks who are ill-equipped to handle a true emergent national crisis - the ineptness and incompetence of this administration is on full display for all Americans to witness firsthand."
2020-02-28 20:09,"No, Mr. Mulvaney. When a person is as incompetent as this president, eventually his ineptitude will catch up to him. Only that we have sycophants like yourself and many members of Congress protecting him has prevented this from happening sooner."
2020-02-28 20:51,"Yes sure we all are because we all want to see the market drop and our retirement accounts evaporate. Yep, that what we all want, Mick. 
I am sick of this administration blaming everyone and everything else for problems they created and those they didn't but are too inept to manage. 
I am sick of republican politicians."
2020-02-28 16:07,Mick's curated statement will play well in MAGAland.  The followers just need a daily reminder to look into the shiny object and forget anything the libs say.
2020-02-28 16:08,"When you elect a pretend president, don't expect him to address a life/death crisis effectively.  He never knew what he was doing, and (really!) has no plan to get us there.  The king has no clue.  And yeah, lives are at stake.  Enjoying your reality show now?"
2020-02-28 17:04,This is one of the most scurrilous charges this immoral and inept adminsitration has yet brought before the public.  There simply is no bottom to their shamelessness.   A mantra we seem to have occasion to repeat daily.  Astonishing.
2020-02-28 15:49,"I agree with Pelosi, Trump looked drugged at Wed night news conference, and he really should get rid of Mulvaney blaming dems on the ineptness of this administration while people are dying."
2020-02-28 16:57,I see we need to add utter ignorance to the criteria necessary for a position in the Trump admin (together with sycophancy and lying).
2020-02-28 17:04,I think Mr Mulvaney should appoint Barron Trump as acting deputy chief of staff so media can cover him everyday
2020-02-28 19:21,Trump is wasting time and American lives by talking about media interference in his politics instead of actively going after this dangerous Corona Virus through Medical Assistance— hard core Science!
2020-02-28 20:16,These guys can't even tell the truth when people are dying.  They should have been in the Nixon administration during the Vietnam war.  What a joke these people are.
2020-02-28 20:18,Paying Mulvaney is a giant waste of taxpayers' dollars. He needs to go — pronto.
2020-02-28 17:49,"Because, of course, EVERYTHING is about Trump."
2020-02-28 19:25,"I'm sure all our upstanding millionaires and billionaires losing trillions of dollars in wealth are in cahoots with our totally corrupt media system to bring down one paranoid nutcase who happens to be president (and who also cut their taxes and has made it exponentially easier for them to accrue more and more wealth).  

And we all know that our top 1% would handily conspire with China (and our fake news media conglomerates) to release this virus in the first place, solely to impugn the moral leadership of our great president.  

It's astounding the lengths the 1% will go to in order to topple the fool who is giving them more than they could ever dream of.  Talk about people acting against their economic self interest!

And yes, this is all a laughable joke, just like the man in the Oval Office."
2020-02-28 15:58,I guess the media is bringing down the stock market too. Or is it Bernie Sanders' fault? Or Nancy Pelosi's? Or is it Hillary? Or the Fed? Or science?
2020-02-28 16:41,Mick Mulvaney needs to remove his foot from his mouth and defer to the legitimate experts on the subject of coronavirus and public health.
2020-02-28 17:07,Just more evidence of how insane you have to be to work in the Trump Administration. You basically lose all sense of decency.
2020-02-28 19:37,"Well, if coronavirus does 'bring down' Trump, as Mulvaney seems to fear, it will not have been all bad."
2020-02-28 20:15,"Soon, Trump and Mulvaney will claim that the Democrats conspired to develop this virus to bring Trump down.  Guliani will join with Devin Nunes to demand that China investigate how the Dems did this and all the rest of the corrupt congressional Republicans will join in."
2020-02-28 20:21,Anyone with any scientific knowledge of what is really going on with the spread of Covid-19 in the US has to have their statements vetted by Mike Pence? Welcome to living in a dictatorship.
2020-02-28 20:54,I have never seen a human being so absolutely afraid of the truth as Donald J Trump. I can’t wait until his reign of terror is over.
2020-02-28 16:01,"Always. It is always about him regardless of the circumstances. Sorry trump, the press is doing its job reporting the news and you aren't going to stop them with your incessant whining. As you have amply shown, you are capable of displaying colossal incompetence on your own without input from the news media. This will be your downfall."
2020-02-28 16:41,"George W. Bush owned the crash of 2008.  The crash of 2020 is just starting, but Trump will own this.
Yes, Trump will deny the problem, and blame others, as he always does.  
Under Obama, the US government was prepared.  But after Trump cut the budget of the CDC two years ago, experts predicted that this would hurt American preparedness:

2020-02-28 18:59,"These are the people we're expecting to lead?  While Mulvaney babbles away, his boss is on his way to another campaign rally in SC to taunt his democratic rivals.  Extraordinary steps?  

How reassuring that they are evidently leading by example in following Mulvaney's advice, just ignore everything.  

MAGA?  Hardly.  Ignorance is bliss is more like it.

Frightening."
2020-02-28 15:40,"Japan just shut down it's entire school system. Communities throughout the world are being closed off to protect other citizens.  Why doesn't this Administration act responsibly, before this coronavirus turns into a Pandemic.

Mulvaney should be in jail, not the White House."
2020-02-28 16:48,"Elect a clown; expect a circus - except this has long stopped being funny, we are hit with a huge crisis and all we get is more propaganda, mark my words, there will be no election this year, just a police state with Trumps enemies all developing COVID-19 and being shipped off to ""quarantine"" camps."
2020-02-28 17:15,"Mulvaney says the media is covering the coronavirus tp bring down the president, when WHO is warning of worldwide spread. Is WHO trying to bring down the president? Meanwhile Trump says the market is coming down because of fear of the Democrats. Really? And Kudlow says stocks look cheap to him ... ever herd o catching a falling knife? These guys are almost comical in their collective incompetence."
2020-02-28 17:57,"Oh for crying out loud, stop already!

This administration and their crazy paranoia that the media is ""exaggerating the seriousness of coronavirus because “they think this will bring down the president"" is creating, causing and promoting more damage with their spin of downplaying the potential risks this deadly virus could have on people.

It almost feels as this administration believes the U.S. will be spared of this deadly virus because we have been lucky thus far in only having a few cases compared to the other 53+ countries that have multiple cases and deaths.

Thank goodness for the media like the NYT that is dedicated to continue its coverage of this virus.  They continue to report the FACTS and the latest updates pertaining to the coronavirus instead of burying their heads in the sand, and telling folks that the ""risk in the U.S. ""is very low"".

I keep recalling Trump's hurricane Sharpie map back in September.  That's right, he has all the answers.

What will bring down the president is his incompetence, his arrogance, and his abuse of power.  Hopefully his base is beginning to see him for what he really is - not fit to be president."
2020-02-28 15:42,"This sounds like the grandmother of all conspiracy theories. I have ""friends"" claiming the stock market downturn is caused by the Democrats, especially Bernie. They believe that the virus is just a mild form of the flu and could not be responsible.

They forget that with China shut down the vital supply chain for domestic manufacturing has been cut off. With so much reliance on China for vital components, industry is throttled. 

How can this be ignored in favor of a more insidious fable? There is simply too much stupid going around these days."
2020-02-28 16:22,Mr. Mulvaney: Prime Minister Netanyahu’s government in Israel has urged Israelis to refrain from flying anywhere because of the coronavirus. It also has required all Israelis returning from trips to Italy to be quarantined for 14 days. Is this also because of Donald Trump?
2020-02-28 17:19,"Doubt the media is hyping this to get rid of Trump. On the other hand,  if it works, thank you “media”"
2020-02-28 18:55,"The administration (I use the term very loosely) of this impeached, imposter president has consistently murdered truth, discredited or de-funded key scientific and health care institutions, ruthlessly characterized critics and opponents, and time and again proven that it's sole priority is the maintenance and extension of power, unrestrained by democratic norms or the rule of law.  And so, Mr. Mulvaney's bitter and irresponsible comments today are par for the course.  As well as another drip, drip in the deluge of evidence that this entire administration is, without question, the most criminal and the most dangerously incompetent in our history."
2020-02-28 20:03,"We were unable to throw him out with impeaching him. If the coronavirus will get his contingent of fools, including Mulvaney booted, I support the media efforts. The idea of Trump’s minions blaming the media for painting Trump with a black brush to get him out of office is an insult to our intelligence. Trump has never admitted to anything he has done wrong in his sorry life. Perhaps it is time."
2020-02-28 20:32,"What is Mulvaney smoking that is making him so delusional? Or is it just in the cool-aid in the punch bowl on Trump's desk?  
If you need another reason to vote ABT (anybody but Trump), maybe the incompetence and mishandling of this threat might help. Unbelievable!"
2020-02-28 15:54,"Before this is all over, this administration will somehow blame this too on Obama."
2020-02-28 16:18,"Where to start?
1) You knew these incompetents would get around to blaming the liberals for COVID19.  That's their strategy for any public health crisis: Blame the Democrats and the media, and tell people ""It probably won't kill you.""  
2) It isn't panicking investors when half the factories in China - our main supplier and principle trading partner - are running below capacity.  That's an incipient recession.  The smart money is getting out, Mick.
3) News about corona virus was all over the place 3-4 weeks ago,  It wasn't the media that wasn't paying attention, it was your Twitter-addicted boss who has the attention span of 2 year old.
4) Barron was ""10 or something"" when Trump was elected?  Seriously?  You complain about the press not covering Barron and you don't even know how old he is?  President's families are off limits, Melania wanted it that way, get over it.
5) Trump didn't sleep on the trip home from India or the next day?  I've done flights like that (Dallas-Sydney, Sydney-London), and the sleep deprivation the next day isn't nice, even if you fly first class and stay hydrated.  If Trump doesn't need sleep during and after flights like that, I think it's fair to ask what he's smoking.

Mulvaney's statements, even in a CPAC context, show that he's not a chief of staff, he's just a political hack.  The problem is, he's a political hack with an incompetent president's ear."

It isn't as if Mick Mulvaney or the White House Communications Director or anyone from that administration is saying ANYTHING except criticisms about how the media covering this virus is trying to bring down the president and that the coronavirus isn't the flu or Ebola.

1. Trump is clueless and incompetent 
2. As a result he makes disastrous administrative decisions
3. He blames the media for the fallout
4. He blames Democrats for the fallout
5. He blames Obama for the fallout
6. He distracts, distracts, distracts, and claims that the situation is really ""great"" but his ""enemies"" are trashing his ""genius"" decisions. 
7. He shuts down communication (such as muzzling his whole HHS by filtering everything through VP Pence)
8. When everything goes South he throws everyone under the bus whom he had actually appointed to handle the mess. 
9. He declares ""victory""

The point was to show how hard Napoleon worked throughout the night, ostensibly for their benefit. 

The truth was Napoleon (much like Hitler too) would sleep in until 10 or later) and it was all for show.

Methinks this statement by Mulvany about Trump not sleeping overnight implies much the same as these other two well known Autocrats."
2020-02-28 18:28,"This just shows how utterly morally bankrupt and unethical Mulvaney and other members of Trump's administration are.
Not even George W. Bush ( who lied about WMDs, gave us never ending wars and policies that set the stage for the 2008 financial meltdown) would have sent his chief of staff out to blame the press for trying to harm his administration by covering a serious public health crisis. Trump and his toadies have lied so often to the public about most subjects, they have zero credibility. And their incompetence – and Trump's perverse insistence on loyalty over qualification – exacerbates response to the covid-19 crisis. It's interesting to me that the White House trotted out Mike Pence to head the response. It's more proof of Trump's serious pathological dysfunction: his ballooning conspiracy theories that anything negative or critical of his administration is an effort to bring him down. It's another page right out of the fascist playbook: blame the media and spread paranoid rumors about the ""victimization"" of the president. It's a pattern they follow consistently and it is unconscionable. A corrupt cult that is eating its own tail:welcome to the Banana Republic of the United States."

Following the 2014 Ebola outbreak, the Obama administration “set up a permanent epidemic monitoring and command” group at the Department of Homeland Security and the National Security Council to coordinate policies among key federal agencies and respond to potential global pandemics.

But,...

In May 2018, Trump ordered the NSC’s entire global health security unit shut down, calling for reassignment of Rear Adm. Timothy Ziemer and dissolution of his team inside the agency. The month before, then-White House National Security Advisor John Bolton pressured Ziemer’s DHS counterpart, Tom Bossert, to resign along with his team. Neither the NSC nor DHS epidemic teams have been replaced.

2020-02-28 20:51,We have a fool in the White House.
2020-02-28 21:06,Mulvaney shouts at media muffled by sand surrounding his head
2020-02-28 18:56,"I’m all for that, haha!  Keep up the good work media!  But does it really help to get rid of the imbecile?"
2020-02-28 19:29,Always blaming someone else. So pathetic.
2020-02-28 20:50,"""the press wants to point out that he's a terrible monster.” - FTFY"

2020-02-28 18:58,So irresponsible.
2020-02-28 19:26,The people who inhabit this administration are nuts.
2020-02-28 19:54,"Dear Mick Mulvaney: In case you haven't received the message just issued (as reported in The Times) from the World Health Organization (W.H.O.), ""'This is a reality check for every government on the planet,' said Dr. Michael J. Ryan, deputy director of W.H.O.’s health emergency program. 'Wake up. Get ready. This virus may be on its way.'” It's not a world-wide conspiracy by Democrats, the media, China, or the W.H.O. to undermine our insecure Narcissist-in-Chief, but a real virus that ""kills people."" So please, ""Get a grip!"" and yes, ""Get over it!"""
2020-02-28 20:27,"Instead of complaining and accusing , it is your government, do something about it. Stop protecting your incompetent know nothing boss."
2020-02-28 20:30,"The public can not trust an administration lead by a compulsive liar wanna-be dictator.  What Trump has done is to make ""Republican"" a synonym for liar."
2020-02-28 19:33,Yes the Corona Virus is the lamestream media's ultimate Fake News. This virus was designed to get Trump because absolutely everything is about Trump (sarc).
2020-02-28 20:08,It's not about you. Get focused.
2020-02-28 20:55,"Now we can clearly see how, while stupid can get us through routine time , stupid in a catastrophe can be fatal. 

You got your judges, GOP senators. You got your Senate Majority Leader who blocked legislation you didn't like. 

Now prepare for the deadly consequences of your choice of a President."
2020-02-28 21:03,"The disease of pathological lying, narcissistic psychopathy and sociopathy has spread to Mulvaney, the entire entire administration - and Republican Party. It is far more dangerous then the Coronavirus. Hopefully the cure will come in November."
2020-02-28 20:48,What a bunch of morons.
2020-02-28 20:29,Paranoid much?
2020-02-28 21:11,"Mulvaney, get real. You are delusional. 
Or are you still drinking the kool aid? 
Read the label: 
Trumpian Kool Aid 
Any flavor. Known to rot the soul and impact the intellect negatively when taken internally."
2020-02-28 20:23,"Stupid statements like Mulvaney made is exactly what we don't need for the Trump admin and their total paranoia about everything. At a time when you want US citizens to heed warnings and actions that may be needed to squelch the epidemic you have a moron like Mulvaney turning this into a political issue with his lies and finger pointing. This admin has no shame, in light of the seriousness of the situation, about turning everything into an anti-Trump crusade. 
There will plenty of time for that come Nov. White voters need to heed the fact that thesis a totally failed admin and we need to throw Trump and his moronic staff out of office in Nov."
2020-02-28 20:31,Mulvaney is a certifiable moron.
2020-02-28 20:52,What an idiot.
2020-02-28 21:04,"How stupid do you have to be to think that, if everyone is saying you are stupid, it must be the fault of the media for reporting all of the stupid things you have done?

We'll find out soon, I guess."
2020-02-28 20:48,I think The NY Times is shady for not reaching out to Diamond or Silk for comment on this story.
2020-02-28 20:57,"Truly idiotic.  The last thing we need is a sleep-deprived President, much less one so delusional he thinks he has eight years left."

2020-02-28 20:57,Here's a thought Mr. Mulvaney: stop politicizing a potential health crisis and do your job as a public servant in helping to prevent its spread.
2020-02-28 21:04,"The ignorance and incompetence represented by the Trump, Pence, Mulvaney White House is unbelievable. 

Instead of addressing public concern by allowing experts at the CDC to explain that the first recorded case of infection of a US citizen occurred near Travis Air Force base in California because people with COVID-19 were flow into that base and allowed to mix with unprotected citizens (despite strong objections from the CDC advising against allowing infected people to mix with unprotected people). Such gross negligence and incompetence is just unbelievable. 

This is why everyone is so concerned that COVID-19 is now ""out in the wild"" and propagating freely in the USA.

In the article, Mulvaney states that COVID-19 is not SARS. However its scientific name is in fact SARS-COV-2 because it is a derivative of SARS and shares 80% of SARS-1 DNA. Further COVID-19 is far worse than SARS-1 since COVID-19 has already killed 4 times more people in just its first 3 months than the original SARS epidemic did in 8 months. Further the original 2002 SARS outbreak only infected 8,098 people, whereas COVID-19 has already infected more than 84,168. SARS-1 only spread to 29 countries, SARS-2 aka COVID-19 as already spread to 60 counties in just 3 months."
2020-02-28 21:15,"It looks bad because it is bad.

Marc Lipsitch - a Harvard epidemiologist, not a tax and regulation cutting right-wing extremist political hack like Mick ""The Razor"" Mulvaney, has opined this virus likely will infect at least 40% of the world's population. The current estimate of the mortality rate is 2%. 

Do the math. We're talking about tens of millions of deaths as a result of the virtually inevitable spread of a highly contagious virus, at huge human and economic cost. 

Yet all Mulvaney, Trump and Trump Jr., Rush Limbaugh and the whole demented chorus of cynical, hate-fueled right-wing cultists can come up with is ""everyone is being so unfair to poor, persecuted Donald J. Trump.""

At what point do all of those fools in the made in China red hats wake up and realize they're being played for suckers, just like the contractors, lenders and investors in the Trump Taj Mahal; the students of phony Trump University; the purchasers of non-existent condo units at failed 'Trump-branded' developments...

Meanwhile, Trump's flunkies have been tasked to purge our government of experienced, knowledgeable personnel who are 'insufficiently loyal' to Fearless Leader Trump. He's taken an ax to the CDC and other agencies that should be geared up to address an emergency of this sort, handcuffed the scientists and replaced them with golf buddies, ex-football players and religious fanatics who still believe in spontaneous generation and creationism and claim that climate change is a hoax."
2020-02-28 21:17,"No, Donald Trump’s tragically ignorant and cravenly self-serving response to the COVID-19 outbreak is what is “bringing down the president.” The people pointing out that the Emperor has no clothes are not the one who elected a man who’d stripped himself naked and has been streaking across the landscape at least since 2015.

Trump, not the media, cut CDC’s budget by 24% well before COVID-19.

Trump, not the media, axed our pandemic response well before COVID-19.

Trump, not the media, slashed CDC’s overseas disease surveillance by 80%, starting in 2017. 

Trump, not the media, appointed a COVID-19 Czar who had botched HIV so badly as governor that it led to the worst HIV outbreak in the state.

Trump, not the media, is calling for public health messaging to be channeled through the White House to make sure it is politically palatable to his administration, thus endangering lives.

Trump, not the media, has downplayed the risk in order to save the stock market because a plummeting Dow makes it harder for reelection. 

The people in charge are dangerously ignorant. Even before COVID-19, we in public health were saying his decisions would mean people will die. Now that we are seeing how that is playing out, it would be grossly irresponsible to not say anything."
2020-02-28 21:09,"This pandemic is giving us, finally, a clear view of what these frauds are all about. Instead of expressing concern about the pandemic, they are already trying to deflect their missteps onto their political opponents and the media. The chickens may finally come home to roost on this one...but not before a lot of people pay a huge price for their incompetence."
2020-02-28 20:53,"Apparently, Trump is always the""victim"".  Except when something positive happens - then he's the responsible party.  Clearly a theme in Trump's existence.  Absolutely a manifestation of his personality disorder and narcissism."
2020-02-28 21:00,"It is tragically clear that the Administration is willing to risk lives, or consider the lives of American citizens in a flippant manner, in order to defend their perceived political interests.  Before the President opened up his mouth, Pence was appointed, and now Mulvaney downplays the emergency, I thought the United States had demonstrated a reasonable and appropriate response.  In the past 48 hours, based solely on the actions of the WH, I have come to the conclusion that we are in serious trouble.  Clearly, none of us should believe what the administration announces.  

Additionally, the straw man argument of comparing the coronoavirus is a false comparison.  The virus has a higher fatality rate, spreads more easily, and would have an additive effect on top of all the deaths we already see.  

Scary times are even more frightening when the people are led by fools."
2020-02-28 20:47,"Pence was assigned the national virus/damage/PR control responsibilities, what, 48 hours ago? And he’s off to Sarasota, Florida this afternoon for a big GOP fundraiser lovefest. He must have solved that minor outbreak issue already. And he didn’t want any homework over the weekend. This administration has absolutely no ability, or interest, in governing. None. It’s all just a big, fat, completely transparent cash-grab. And oh so grotesque."
2020-02-28 20:55,"When Donald can produce a single microscopic organism with a press pass or registered as a Democrat, I will start to take Mick's criticism more seriously. Until then, accurate information is one of the most important weapons against the spread of this disease. This is a case where more than truth dies in darkness."
2020-02-28 21:05,"We've had our fingers crossed for over three years that the revolving door of unqualified Trump minions, few of whom have any tangible experience in government, and all of whom are apparently comfortable with continuous and constant lying about things big and small, would never have to handle an actual crisis.  Here we are - hopefully they'll figure it out."
2020-02-28 21:23,"So the takeaway to the media is don't report about the virus and possible pandemic, talk about Barron. I feel safer already."
2020-02-28 20:42,"Books have been written about how authoritarian governments put their citizens at risk through efforts to control the narrative.  See Midnight in Chernobyl for an excellent example.  It's foolish to  believe the same cannot happen here with an administration bent on telling any lie it can to improve its image or to find someone or something other than its own failed policies to blame.  Our responses to recent natural disasters do not inspire confidence.  And Mulvaney, a man whose raison d'être is to defend an indefensible president, is among the worst of this White House's messengers."
2020-02-28 21:10,"When asked  what are you going to do to calm the markets Mulvaney  response was tell people to turn their televisions off.
It may surprise Mr Mulvany that many Americans  for close on four years now have been following his advise.
 Every time his boss Trump is on TV we garb the remote and turn the TV off . 
 We do so to 'calm our nerves', and keep our blood pressure from boiling over."
2020-02-28 20:40,"I am shocked that the public has not seen the results of any polling on this?

Do you trust Donald Trump to tell Americans the truth about the coronavirus?  

I suspect that the reason that very obvious poll is not being taken is because a shocking number of Trump supporters would admit ""no, don't believe half of what Trump says.""

Or a better question:

Who do you believe, Donald Trump or the doctors at the CDC who might be Democrats?"
2020-02-28 20:45,"I would most strongly suggest that Mulvaney embarks in a fact finding mission to the affected areas in China, or for that matter to Italy if he so prefers, to prove his point the alarm about the corona virus is a plot to bring Trump down. Am sure many of us readers would happily contribute to financing his trip."
2020-02-28 21:09,"""blamed the media for exaggerating the seriousness of coronavirus because “they think this will bring down the president, that’s what this is all about.”""

This is pure projection on the part of Republican operatives and their Fox propagandists---- that is exactly what Trump, Fox and other Republicans were doing to try to bring down Obama during the Ebola epidemic, in spite of pro-active, science based expertise.

Now the (real) fact is that Trump slashed funding for preparedness and for the CDC itself, and purged from the White House science-oriented leaders with the expertise to handle this."
2020-02-28 21:09,"Mulvaney is trying to recover some of the good graces he lost from Trump when he said in England that the USA needs more immigrants.  Mulvaney had no self-respect, which means he agrees with my opinion of him."
2020-02-28 21:19,"Donald Trump has been a failure at everything he ever touched -- except marketing.   He could market himself a businessman for reality TV and he (with some Russian assistance) managed to market himself to a minority of voters who gave him the presidency.  Since then he has attempted to market a poor administration as a series of successes. 
Reality is starting to assert itself, and Trump does not know what to do, except try to blame others."
2020-02-28 21:20,I think the president is doing an effective job of bringing himself down without any help from the media.
2020-02-28 21:14,"If the epidemic were not a serious problem it would be utterly hilarious that Mulvaney is blaming the media on this one. It is Mr. Mulvaney's job to help the president execute strategies and policies. If the response to the virus is not going well, Mick need not look beyond his mirror to find someone to blame. The press reports on events after the fact, not before, so Mick has every opportunity to get ahead of the media and do things right. It's the same as the fantasy Trump tried to sell that the Democratic debate on Tuesday NIGHT was the cause of the market slides on Monday and Tuesday-really?"
2020-02-28 20:49,"And to think that Mulvaney sought to be considered for the presidency of a university (South Carolina, I believe) not so long ago.  What a disaster that would have been."
2020-02-28 20:51,"Again, when non-partisan observers report what is happening---as when the whistle blowers (the ""perfect"" phone call and now the unprepared and unequipped health workers exposed to the virus) do what duty and decency demand--Trump and his cohorts lash out and in a vindictive rage blame the observers. With the whistle blowers Trump loyalists could only get their clutches on the latter, but would have loved to destroy both. Only the incompetent , the ""keystone cops"" in-politics, are so totally involved in blaming.  Trump goes further in hiring Charles Harder and his law firm  and spends more than two million to sue the media for saying ""bad things"" about the perfect genius. If the media does not wildly praise and applaud they are evil, in the eyes of ""Trumpists"". 
Here is a most imperfect leader who is seized by rage and  reacts irrationally  when his actions are not applauded as great.  He should never have entered the spotlight.  The Blame Game."
2020-02-28 20:59,"We have seen this crisis coming towards us for months.  Being hostile to science (and reality), this administration lacks the expertise to deal with this issue.
More mundanely, I think the President and the people around him are simply, but extremely, lazy.  A competent response would have required real work...not just  bloviating in front of the cameras.  And 99% of what this President has done (besides hanging out playing golf or staying at Mar A Lago) is talk to a camera  after first enjoying his TV time...I mean 'executive time'"
2020-02-28 21:04,"And, so, out come the conspiracy theories. Seriously, this spin is appalling and totally unnecessary. The deflections are fierce and are going to get worse. At this point, do we expect anything different from these people? I get trying to put a positive spin on things but just read the reports and look who's actually been given the power to do something about it. Confidence is in the dumper for a reason, but I'm sure somehow Hilary's emails, Biden's contacts in Ukraine, Bernie the Red, or Obama just because will be spun up ad nauseam as a way to either blame or just create a smokescreen.

Just be careful out there, folks. We'll get through this."
2020-02-28 20:42,"He is right. It is all about him and his policies. Even those that have benefited by the tax break, voterwise, people who have 401k's can easily see that what Trump represents is wrong. The amoral, unethical behaviour. The appeal to authoritarian methods and governments. The inability to believe anything that he says about anything.

We are all terribly nervous, horrified by the direction that he is trying to take us. Only the desperately lost find his rage engendered approach appealing."
2020-02-28 20:42,"Mulvaney's response is exactly the type of response that will bring down this administration all by itself.   Who do they think they serve? - because it sure sounds like themselves.  The media has figured out the people want to know about this, and about what the government is doing about it and what the government CAN do about this.  The administration serves the people, but it sure seems like this administration thinks the people, including the media, serve it."
2020-02-28 20:54,"If the death rate of influenza were the same as Corvid19, 540,000 would die from flu. NOT the same."
2020-02-28 20:44,"Mulvaney is so paper thin. 

Simple search of the last 5 weeks major events (back to Jan 24) shows that the coverage of the outbreak in China was happening along side impeachment. 

And the return of the US residents from the cruise ship happened well after impeachment vote in the Senate. 
The return just a couple of weeks ago. 

I don't think the administration wants to have scrutiny of that return because they apparently messed it up with unprotected personnel. 

Everything these guys say should be taken like a gang of criminals - a mob - all spinning to make themselves look good. 

Not a hint of decency."
2020-02-28 20:48,He doesn't need the media.  He's doing a great job all on his own.
2020-02-28 20:52,"The Trump Administration: Desperate, flailing, and failing.

l taught at an academic regional medical center for more than 30 years.  There is no better way to understand and appreciate the harm that lies can do to people and society than when it comes to medicine and contagious diseases.

I'll go further.  As I watched business values and corporations take over medicine in our country, it is clear that the values of business and the private sector are at odds and too often work against the values of medicine, health care, and the public sector.  

You can't propagandize and politically advertise your way out of an epidemic.  In fact, the Trump Administration has done everything to make the situation worse--starting with blocking affordable universal health care for all Americans, cutting funding for medicine and science research, and driving competent professionals out of government.

The Trump administration is about to reap the consequences of what it has sowed when the coronavirus comes to town."
2020-02-28 21:03,It's always about someone else or the media coverage.  It would be refreshing to hear this administration own just one their many failures.
2020-02-28 21:08,"First of all, we are depending on scientists and hoping that those who govern are too. But in a nation where the Governor of Texas once stood on the shores of the Gulf and tried to pray away the BP oil spill, right along side the ex Governor of Alaska, that hope is problematic. Now add in the Trump selected Virus Czar; Praying Pence, and you can never be sure whether the science will be funded and followed, or denied and denigrated."
2020-02-28 20:42,"Preventative medicine was politicized for one man's ego. As expected, this has backfired. Irony is not dead."
2020-02-28 20:50,"If Mr. Trump and his team took 1/100th of the time he spends criticizing the  media and used it to prepare for the coronavirus, we'd be in good shape. But, that's not going to happen. It's all about him, and nobody else. And it's ALWAYS someone else's fault."
2020-02-28 20:50,The media keeps reporting the spread with some reports on the best way to protect yourself. What I really want to know what is the survival rate broken down by age? I’ve down a Google search but I can’t any info on that. I wish there were articles on the survival rates because then such info might calm people’s fears.
2020-02-28 20:52,"As a physician the administration needs to show responsibility and leadership and not to underplay the potential seriousness of this virus. 

This is not the time for political theater and for people making arguments that this is all about politics

No this is about a deadly virus and keeping the public adequately informed with scientifically accurate data
untinged by political overtones."
2020-02-28 21:16,"By the usual standards, Mulvaney received a good education. I have my doubts about the adequacy of the two year real estate curriculum to which Trump was exposed at Penn to prepare him for leadership. But I doubt either of these had a course in microbiology, so why would anybody listen to them about a new virus? Scientists are underrepresented in the government power structure, and I suspect even a rudimentary science education is missing for most of these people. Of course Trump won't let us see his transcripts: those documents he skewered Obama for not releasing."
2020-02-28 21:23,"When the wonderful comedian Tim Conway passed away, a lot of people posted a video clip of him playing a bumbling dentist who had to resort to an instruction book on how to treat a patient as the guy squirmed in the chair. I'm flashing back to that clip now as we face a real health emergency, but I'm not laughing."
2020-02-28 21:16,"I live in a remote, rural area. Now that Mulvaney has verified the current administration cares more about its image than the public's well-being, all the more reason to stay home."
2020-02-28 21:22,"I just received an email blast from my doctor's office, listing the kinds of symptoms to be on the look out for, various precautions to take and to contact his practice with any questions. 

And yet, all I read from the acting White House chief of staff is that ""This is not Ebola"" and the media is ""exaggerating the seriousness of coronavirus because they think it will bring down the president."" 

I am grateful to have a physician who is being proactive and is reaching out to his clients to assure them that he and his staff are and will continue to be available in any capacity necessary. 

But shouldn't a similar kind of reassurance be coming from the president and his staff? 

All that those guys are accomplishing is the creation of more fear and uncertainty because they care more about Trump than the American citizen. 

Talk about priorities being skewed and self serving."
2020-02-28 20:46,This not what the average taxpayer voter would call competent leadership.  It is not a game any more and a rally with the base is not the answer.

Seriously people this is all about Trump, not about American health in the face of a pandemic.

It's what you voted for."
2020-02-28 20:58,"This administration has gone far beyond crazy.  Soon they will say the Democrats created the virus either to take attention away from their primaries, or to embarrass Trump or some other beyond the pale idea.
How much longer can this country take this illness?"
2020-02-28 20:58,"Trump has built his entire Presidency and professional career on misinformation. We will not get good information or honesty from this President, and Americans will die because of it."
2020-02-28 20:59,Trump's incompetence and hubris will bring him down. The media doesn't need to make this type of stuff up.
2020-02-28 21:25,"Does the White House really believe it's own word?  If so they need to go.   Do then think that China, Korea and Japan are taking the strident measures they have because this strain of the coronavirus isn't a real threat?  Then, Donald Jr. comes out and accuses the Democrats of wanting to have the virus kill millions so that his father looks bad.  These are egotistical folks with a deep seated sickness."
2020-02-28 21:26,A mind is a terrible thing to waste ... on a person who doesn't use it.
2020-02-28 21:27,"Many of these posts talk about how deadly the virus is,  how contagious it is and how many people have been diagnosed in the U.S.  These posts contradict each other, which is unsettling when it comes to a deadly disease.  We clearly are not getting good information.  The inconsistencies are coming from the President, his staff and the media too.  I think these posts demonstrate how important it is to have the CDC and experts such as doctors and scientists providing us with information and being supported and utilized to be the official sources of information.  Maybe there is an agenda to use this as a way to bring down the President.  I don't care and neither should he. Focus on the situation and just give us some solid, consistent expert-provided information."
2020-02-28 21:27,"Serious question, cos I don’t actually know the answer: In the USA, if you have no cash or private medical insurance; and if you suspect that you might have Covid-19 symptoms, can you actually go get a medical consultation, and treatment?"
2020-02-28 21:25,"Dangerous though it is, COVID-19 is also a warning shot. The next epidemic could combine the ease of transmission of this virus with the lethality of Ebola. 

To defend against it we will need a healthcare system that includes everyone. Millions of people who can't afford to see a doctor are at far greater risk of transmitting communicable diseases, even to people with great health insurance. Your medical coverage can protect me, as mine protects you. 

We need leaders who face reality unflinchingly and tell the truth to the people, not pander to their prejudices. We need leaders who respect science, even when it tells them things they don't want to hear. And we Americans have to make it clear that we won't settle for less."
2020-02-28 21:28,"Just because you're paranoid, doesn't mean they're not out to get you. But maybe it's time to be paranoid about the right thing."
2020-02-28 21:36,"We don’t need a pandemic to bring down Donald Trump. He has created all by himself , hundreds of valid reasons for the need to be rid of him by any legal means possible. We  don’t need the coronavirus to bring him down. 
Instead of all of this toxic verbal garbage that is being spewed out by Donald Trump‘s team in the White House maybe they should think about saving America from the misery that awaits them and  the rest of the world. Maybe they should think about something other than themselves for a change. 
If you really want to know the truth amidst a cesspool of disinformation,we are dealing with two diseases: the disease of Donald Trump which is tearing the country apart from the inside socially, politically, and spiritually. And then there is the coronavirus which threatens to kill us physically. Both of these diseases are reprehensible and lethal and they each need to be eradicated by any means possible."
2020-02-28 21:36,"Curiouser and curiouser, to quote Lewis Carroll's Alice. Have we somehow stumbled or fallen into the crazed realm of the Queen of Hearts (off with their heads! screamed Trump, re the media), or perhaps crossed through the looking glass, where everything is backwards and makes no sense at all? It's all nauseating, like being trapped in a circus funhouse with no means of escape. Excuse me while I go toss my cookies. Maybe the coronavirus will save me from this nightmare."
2020-02-28 21:41,"Can anyone ask more devotion, passion and loyalty than Mulvaney? This guy is so phenomenal that just makes me want to throw up...

maybe because this is the only job he can do, nobody else would hire him..."
2020-02-28 21:47,"Yes it’s all about Trump the narcissist. Let’s get him and his cronies out of office before it’s too late for our Republic and our world. That includes taking back the Senate and the courts.  Wake up
MAGA supporters: he cares nothing for you or America."
2020-02-28 21:32,Trump's dismantling of CDC is what will bring him down....another example of him getting hoisted on his own petard (and blaming the media)....woefully predictable.
2020-02-28 21:41,"Mr. Mulvaney, ""acting"" though he is, is nonetheless skilled at the art of propaganda in service to his boss."
2020-02-28 21:43,"Mick - nope he brought this on himself when he started denying that there was a problem in the US.     Donald has lost the narrative, well except for RW media and every Republican should know that and care if they care at all for their constituents."
2020-02-28 21:48,"Last week trump’s so-called“best” week kaput, History; stock market plunging deplorably, trump’s worst week so far."
2020-02-28 21:40,"Drought in the south, storm in the north, virus in the east, fires in the west. Panic rides the air we breathe, it seems. But never mind, says Trump.  All just a plot to make Trump look bad, seeing that all the workings of history and the universe are about Donald Trump. This is megalomania, and now the man allows only those who agree to his delusions to hold power or speak, having driven out even partial candor. How much pathology would infest the nation even if the virus never came? Even if the market never fell? The greatest sickness is in those who know what he is and still abet him for their ends, a moral illness even more wicked than that avatar of deadly sins hulking in the White House now."
2020-02-28 21:41,"It should be easy for Trump to pretend he’s an adult, show some command of the situation, and possibly calm the markets by doing so. FDR and others have responded to crises this way. 

Instead he and his team of third-raters can’t help but make it clear that he’s incapable of leadership, and paranoid about being voted out of the White House if the economy tanks, and therefore subject to prosecution. So he’s lashing out at the media and Democrats instead of at least pretending to be presidential. 

He can’t even fake it. He is his own worst enemy, as well as the country’s."
2020-02-28 21:44,"This entire scenario about Mulvaney trying to drag the father/son relationship between Trump and Barron is bizarre, to say the least.

My gosh - I am NO fan of Trump, but for crying out loud, leave his youngest son out of the media!  I completely agree with the First Lady's wishes to keep him out of the spotlight.

Apparently, things in Trumpland must be getting pretty desperate for Mulvaney to stoop so low by attempting to deflect the coronavirus and stock market problems with happy and blissful moments between the president and his son.

It's great to read that the president stays in touch with his youngest son and has a loving relationship with him but he's still a terrible president who makes less than stellar decisions for the country.

Good dad / bad president.

Most people know and see the difference without having to have Mulvaney drum up some kind of story."
2020-02-28 21:33,There is no way I would have put the officials through the ordeal of fidgeting while waiting for the Almighty to emerge as Trump did before entering to announce his learned response to the covid 19 crisis.
2020-02-28 21:37,"I'm on record is disbelieving anything that the administration says until it is thoroughly proven to be absolutely, positively, indomitably true, but here is a request for the press.
  
What preparations should I, Joe Average, be making right now to prepare for a possible emergency, and, to minimize the risk to myself until it arrives.
  
I am not real worried, but an ounce of prevention is worth several hours of Trump press conferences..."
2020-02-28 21:40,"To summarize: It's outlandish to suggest that Trump would have illegal dalliances with Russia and Ukraine, despite all the evidence suggesting otherwise, to help boost his electoral prospects. 

But it's reasonable to suggest the media, Dems and, uh, China, I guess, have conspired to create and hype a new virus to hurt Trump's electoral prospects."
2020-02-28 21:45,Trump brings down Trump and everyone who associates with him. His downfall is not created by the media. He does it to himself and his supporters.
2020-02-28 21:29,"Mulvaney and Trump are prevaricators of the first order.  

COVID 2019 is potentially much more dangerous than Ebola, SARS and MERS for the very reason that it is far more readily transmitted from host to host.  The metric used to compare epidemics is not the # of deaths but the # of deaths among those infected.  

In the case of COVID-2019, transmission occurs as readily as it does for the common cold (also often a Corona virus) and whereas MERS, SARS and EBOLA are much more virulent and kill a higher percentage of those infected, those viral pathogens were not as readily transmitted form host to host.  COVID 19 depending on the studies, kills between 0.4 percent to 3.4% of all infected persons (for reference seasonal influenza/flu kills 0.1% ). 

Do the math, if America has 325 million people and COVID 2019 infects just 100 million people (roughly 1 in 3), the expected mortality rate would be from 400,000 to 3.4 million among those infected.   If transmission is not stoppable than the above numbers could double or triple.    

So we could looking at the a pandemic event which would kill a population equal to that of New Hampshire or Maine or Missouri or Massachusetts.  When you think of the damage in those terms, this country should be on a war footing and we should be activating the national guards and federalizing them and stockpiling antivirals and nationalizing production of respirators and ventilators and activating reservists in medical units to deal with this."
2020-02-28 21:34,"Public Health is a National Security Issue - this is not a game. The administration needs to grow up (fast) and take its management role seriously. It isn't a game of us and them, conservative versus liberal, or an opportunity to demonize the media. It is an opportunity to stand up to the role and stop sniffling through with a sense of entitlement."
2020-02-28 21:29,His loyal adherents continue to amplify Trump's overriding message - that he is the center of all attention.  They only exacerbate it by attempting to deflect bad news.  Why not just admit that the President hasn't the power to do anything but prepare and respond to the best of the government's ability?
2020-02-28 21:30,"Given the Trump administration's history of outright lies, attacking whistleblowers, denigrating science and scientists, and singular focus on retaining power, those with even a modicum of critical thinking skills would be justifiably skeptical of any ""information"" the administration may provide about the virus.  I for one am profoundly grateful to the mainstream media for its posing questions to, and reporting on information received from, ACTUAL experts in public health and virology that have not been directed to selectively moderate their message (sorry Alex Azar and Mike Pence, but former pharmaceutical lobbyists and ""messaging"" overseen by conservative Christians having no scientific or medical qualifications does not inspire any confidence whatsoever) ."
2020-02-28 21:38,"This seems to be how politics work. A president comes into office and tries to take all credit for everything the previous president did. Unfortunately, they also get to take the bad that comes during their term. How Trump deals with this threat will show what kind of president he really is. Trump is no leader and has no skills to deal with a real crisis. 

Being president isn't only about the economy, it's also keeping the public informed and country prepared for anything. This administration needs to stop pointing the finger at the media and lead by example."
2020-02-28 21:50,"It's been a few days since the alarms for the virus started in the US and I'm already worn out by how politicians on both parties are using it. If a looming pandemic is not a reason enough to find some consensus, then we truly are doomed."
2020-02-28 21:54,"No, Mt. Mulvany: the flu is deadly serious. Just as in earlier generations measles, polio, and chicken pox were as well (the latter a generally mild childhood disease but lingering to strike as shingles painfully later in life).  As a nation we have taken robust health for granted. I cannot do that. I have seen the ravages of diseases with good recovery rates. Even a mild flu often leads to complications and death to any with weakened immune or respiratory systems.

On your second point: As a mother, I am also very cognizant of Mrs. Trump's repeated pleas for the press to NOT cover her son, and for the most part, her wishes have been honored. Now you believe that the media is acting badly?

Healing of this very fractured nation requires respect and truthfulness all around -- and respect also requires listening to voices, studies, and competencies beyond those held by oneself and even contrary to them. Mr. Lincloln's team of rivals during a critical period in US history attests to the value of that.  It is not a positive attribute that Mr. Trump does not sleep or in other ways indulges in unhealthy lifestyles, not only becuase he needs to model those practices but also because he needs to be alert, responsive, and able to engage and reconcile diverse viewpoints. Contrary to your assessment, I believe that the media has been very tolerant of his dismissal of any views other than his own-- whether domestically or abroad."
2020-02-28 21:33,I can't imagine what Trump will say and how the germaphobe-in-chief will react after someone at the White House becomes ill with this virus.
2020-02-28 21:54,Has anyone sat down with Trump and explained to him - slowly - that he could get the covid-19 virus too? He's in the public a lot.
2020-02-28 22:01,"The blame game extraordinaire.

I am surprised that I haven't yet heard them blame Obama for the virus.

I have not yet learned of a scientific, cogent, coordinated plan that deals with this covid issue for the US and its world relationships.

Where is that, oh blamers?"
2020-02-28 21:01,"Just another example of Trump's delusional egocentricity. The media hype such things to get viewers, regardless of who is president. Anyone remember the flesh-eating virus?"
2020-02-28 21:07,"Narcissism continues to plague the psyche and mental focus of POTUS. We have a pandemic disrupting lives across the globe, and he manages to whine and turn the focus on himself."
2020-02-28 21:15,"Trump and his Republicans toadies have so perfectly demonstrated incompetence that it has become inescapable. 

Just ask the stock market."
2020-02-28 21:20,Trump and all his loyalists are paranoid and susceptible to any conspiracy theory that serves their narrative.
2020-02-28 21:48,Bring down? Trump's already a bring down.

2020-02-28 21:56,"Mick, just get all those Trump supporter Evangelicals to pray for him. All will be good."
2020-02-28 22:12,I suppose we have to accept the 2800 plus who have died from the virus worldwide were all anti trumpers.
2020-02-28 22:17,"Aside from the fact you might wonder about the Vice President, ""What else is he doing?""   you might remember the administration's, and Mr. Mulvaney's,  mantra: ""Just get over it.""  They will ignore this threat, like any other, as a Democratic threat to undermine their regime. Somewhere, Hillary and Nancy Pelosi will have to pay.  Maybe we could put  BIG tariff  on this Mexican beer that's causing the whole thing."
2020-02-28 21:11,Let's send the Trump administration on an all-inclusive cruise to any infected destination of their choice.
2020-02-28 21:52,And this guy's boss has the Codes too.  Good thing the boss-man seems rational and seems lookin out for the national interest....if not?...Heart of America.
2020-02-28 21:53,"How can the public have confidence in this administration when Trump,  Mulvaney  and other Trump appointees and loyalists choose to politicize this pandemic instead of being forthright, affirmative and constructive. Americans have had  enough of this administration's obfuscation, deceit and incompetence. See you in November."
2020-02-28 21:57,Are you kidding me?!? Unbelievable. The Republican party has sunken to a new low with that one. I hope the Democrats steam roll them in the upcoming election and get those guys out there. Fear mongering at it's finest.
2020-02-28 22:00,There is nothing that Donald Trump  cannot make all about himself.
2020-02-28 22:13,"“Requiring that any experts' information about COVID-19 and its risks be managed by the VP or WH Chief of Staff” . . .

The administration policy is consistent, Do not let Americans know what trump is doing."
2020-02-28 22:14,"This the same guy who's says something on National TV then a while later denies he said  it? 

Gee this seems to be the explanation for everything that goes wrong, Dems did it and fake media promotes it. I do like the new word ""socialist""  added to dangerous liberals.

Its not any governments fault its how they will react to this, We will see if trump group is interested in  the pandemic and preventing disease or  if they really just want to protect Trump.

I woulld say Pence and Alzar already being set up to blame."
2020-02-28 22:17,"is he accusing ""us"" of making up the facts? or is he saying that we shouldn't talk about it because it embarrasses the President and points out the foolishness of some of his policies?"
2020-02-28 21:58,Perhaps it’s time for the White House to hold regular press conferences if they want to get the word out on this and all other issues.
2020-02-28 21:51,"We Americans are hamstrung by a president who has lied all his life. Therefore, it is his prism of deflection/defection that is in play as we fast forward to, say, April 2020: 

The virus has taken hold and uprooted American society, hundreds (thousands?) die — and Trump crows that we were well prepared as a nation and that he did “the best job that anybody could’ve done.” 

Hope I am very wrong, but the science and DJT’s lack of ethics and credibility says I’m likely right."
2020-02-28 21:54,Mr. Trump has said that there will be a miracle that will overcome this virus.  And if there is such a miracle he will take credit for it.  If there's no miracle it will be because the media and the Democrats have conspired to prevent the miracle that Mr Trump is expecting.
2020-02-28 21:55,"True story, before I read this article, I hadn't thought about how this coronavirus was Trump's fault. Really strange, I know, I guess I missed the memo that I should be blaming this virus on Trump, and I didn't see this as something that would bring down the president.

Seems to me like they've used this line so often they forgot to think if it actually applies here."
2020-02-28 21:58,"The media is conspiring to take down this president?  Right Mulvaney, right.  
The thing is, the media doesn't have to try to hard to point out the inadequacies and chaos in this administration.
And, Mulvaney bringing this up only confirms for me that they are aware of the bungling, and know they need to throw up flack.
It'd be comical if it wasn't so depressing."
2020-02-28 21:59,"And when you get the virus, Mulvaney will tell you to ""get over it"".  Clearly, he's a short timer and he and Pence will take the fall."
2020-02-28 22:08,This is what a reality distortion field looks like.
2020-02-28 22:11,"Take heart residents of the United States here's what the Secretary of Health & Human Services has stated about a potential coronavirus vaccine: ""Azar argued that the pharmaceutical industry is best poised to discover, manufacture, and market a vaccine for coronavirus. When asked about the cost of vaccines, Azar, the former pharmaceutical industry lobbyist, responded that the price may be high, but that this will ultimately deliver an important vaccine, even if many Americans cannot afford it.""

2020-02-28 21:55,"It's unbelievable that the administration is downplaying the start of a possible pandemic. 
Denying climate change was bad enough, but with this, the deaths can be confirmed if they just want to look.
Instead they're treating the virus like a financial nuisance and a campaign problem. 
They're showing no empathy, no compassion and no human decency!"
2020-02-28 22:03,"Mulvaney: The press is trying to bring down Trump; FAKE NEWS!

Actually, the press is reporting accurately and tracking progress/developments as they happen, as a free press should. As far as I’m able to see, Trump and his administration hate the First Amendment, but love the Second Amendment.

Bravo, inter-press!"
2020-02-28 22:09,"Always eager to stoke the hatred and anger, Republicans have become inured to their own messaging. To them, it seems normal to see enemies behind every comment, every action. They assume that the fear-mongering that defines them is the same as what everyone would inflict on America. They have no sense of the civic ""us"", just a lot of me, me, me."
2020-02-28 22:09,"This is One of those times when citizens needs to be able to have complete trust  in the intelligence, expertise, and honesty of the  leadership of the country.  Unfortunately the history  of lies, evasions and misinformation handed out daily by our current President and his staff lead to a bleak forecast for any kind of organized and effective handling of this health emergency.   

The only things on Trump’s mind is re-election and weekend golf.  The path to re-election lies  in the same kind of name calling and lies that worked the first time."
2020-02-28 22:00,"The coverage of COVID-19 appears to me to be equivalent to the level of coverage given to H1N1, MERS,Swine flu and SARS. The administration's ongoing need to dismiss this as caused by the big, bad media's desire to ""get trump"" only undermines my confidence in their ability and willingness to process the data given them by the medical community and take appropriate measures."
2020-02-28 22:02,At this moment I am reflecting on how far we’ve come from expecting leadership for our basic survival from our leader(s).
2020-02-28 22:05,"One way to try to extend a regime is to build a big tent and give those who show up and behave sincerely a say at the table. 

Another is to build a concrete bunker and create a culture of paranoia to squash dissent.

Despite history's many verdicts on this second strategy, Trump and those like him still see no other path."
2020-02-28 22:17,"Not sleeping is a significant cause of Trump's obvious problems: lack of concentration or even ordinary  comprehension, error-prone inability to communicate, delusions, mania. Many  psychiatrists would likely agree. It's under these conditions that he gets his ""information"" from Fox News in the middle of the night. Alarmingly, his fans don't seem to care."
2020-02-28 22:17,Why not? A crisis that Trump didn't create is a crisis he cannot cope with.
2020-02-28 22:13,"Wouldn't it be something if this tiny yet powerful virus could actually ""bring this president down.""

I sincerely hope no one suffers any dire consequences from this virus.  We have this guy as president.  That's pretty dire in and of itself on so many levels."
2020-02-28 22:02,The fact that Mike Pence is in charge of filtering information means the Republicans absolutely plan on lying and deceiving the American people. Trump’s re-election campaign is more important than National Security or public health. House and Senate Republicans have ALL stated this publicly by dishonestly clearing Trump on the impeachment charges. Trump and Republicans are the most dangerous thing facing the American people right now.
2020-02-28 19:38,Sure hope he does NOT get eight years!
2020-02-28 22:37,"I listened to the audio briefing from CDC. You could hear a definite struggling push and pull in Dr. Messonnier's response to questions. The dance around was obvious compared to her previous content oriented briefings before the Pence thumb came down. 

I've never heard so many um's and um's um's as she tried to stay close to whatever ""instructions"" she has received from the administration as she took questions. This was not how she presented in previous briefings. Today, some questions were answered with her characteristic directness and competency and others were an exercise in saying less and being evasive. 

This style is distinctly different from her previous briefings where she did a pretty good job of trying to be transparent while also realistic about unknowns and issues. I've listened to several over the last week,  and today's has the distinct fingerprint of the administration interferring with what this professional infectious disease expert is sharing with the public. Clear political fiddling in the job these experts are tasked to do in communicating to the public."
2020-02-28 22:39,"The main thing we can all do to avoid this virus is to stay away from people. It is time to stock up on things that you use regularly, not because there are  likely to be serious shortages of most items but because it is safest to stay away from places where people congregate. Do your shopping at off hours in fact one AM would be the best time to go shopping at places like Walmart. Use the shopping aps and either pick it up or use home delivery. Most pharmacies will deliver. Stay away from your doctor or dentist for routine visits. Vote by mail. Don't go to concerts  movies and make sure your kids don't.
    Once a reasonably good immunization is available have it done."
2020-02-28 22:45,Comforting to know that Trump's thoughts are first and foremost for himself. The health and safety of Americans pales in comparison to the importance of Trump's reelection.
2020-02-28 22:19,"Trump is president so he alone is accountable for the handling of the coronavirus in this country. And accountability is one thing he cannot handle. See the accountability about that huge wall that Mexico was going to pay for. See the accountability about the huge increase in US manufacturing and the opening of thousands of US factories and hundreds of thousands of jobs. See the accountability for controlling prescription drug prices and protecting people with pre-existing health conditions. See the accountability for the huge increase in federal revenues after the tax cut. None of these things materialized, none of them ever will, and he is 100% at fault. And you'll never hear him accept one iota of blame. The mishandling of the coronavirus is just another place to blame the media while Trump does nothing."
2020-02-28 22:41,Always all about Trump.  This is not about Trump.  This is about all Americans.   Of course he can not see that.  He does not care about us.  This is a serious situation that needs immediate attention.  We have an administration that does not serve the public as they should.
2020-02-28 23:01,"Remember when a president faced with with a public health crisis would set politics aside and make protecting the public through infection identification, containment, and prevention the top priorities? I know... the whole concept is so four years ago."
2020-02-28 22:25,"Since his first day in office, Trump has attempted to manage information in a way that reflects well on him, beginning with a lie about the size of his inaugural crowd. According to the Washington Post he has told 16,000 plus lies since; yet he seems surprised that neither the markets nor the general public believe his claim that the Coronavirus is under control. Our president has zero credibility; he blames everyone else for his failures—it’s the media trying to bring him down or the Democrats playing politics with a pandemic. Actually, this time the blame for whatever happens falls squarely where it belong: on Trump himself."
2020-02-28 22:34,"First, the stock market was smoke and mirrors and if it can be toppled in days due to a virus, start placing money (real money) elsewhere. 

Wall Street needed a scape goat like they did in 2008."
2020-02-28 22:59,"Trump's first offense is to launch a defense.  Start blaming the press, anybody, just blame.  It continues to shock me. 
The Mulvaney interview and his comments are beyond comprehension - drawing conclusions about severity comparing coronavirus to flu and ebola.  He should leave that to the CDC.  Here we have a serious threat calling for  leadership, communication and preparation. Instead we get Mulvaney preparing Trump's defense... Mulvaney may well have just said ""Trump can't lead, communicate or prepare for a global threat because the press is being mean to him.  How can he do his job when the press is unfair.   Yes, it sounds that bad."
2020-02-28 22:21,"I suspect that in a week or two - Trump will cancel all his travel and public appearances - and just stay in the Whitehouse -and have others wear masks - and keep 6 feet away from him.  No more handshakes - no more photo ops - just stay back.  

Don't laugh - it will happen."
2020-02-28 22:40,"""They think this will bring down the president, that’s what this is all about.”  Really?  This sounds rather desperate.  True, a great many Americans have never heard or care about Mulvaney, but after taking a stroll in the cold sun earlier in the day, We The People were all at one in being at our best, in understanding that this is a non-political virus and even better, looking after each other.

""The flu kills people"", adds Mulvaney, and ""This is not Ebola"".  Perhaps those of us listening to this enlightenment from the acting White House Chief of Staff, should be grateful for this clarification, a singular gaffe, where one disease has nothing to do with the other.

Preparations are being made; industrious workers behind the health counters are more patient than usual, and we are seeing how resilient America can be when placed to the test.

This latest from The White House appears to be grasping for straws, as 'Panic' engulfs Wall Street, if not Main Street and the Heart of America.

It might be of interest for The Press, during the duration of this unexpected virus, to sound out the possibility of a 'Pence Presidency' -  Something new to take our mind off the flu."
2020-02-28 22:28,"""I've only got eight years..."".  Let's hope he's as wrong about that as he is pretty much everything else."

.  .  .  .  .  
It always tickles me when the premier purveyor of falsehoods gripes about others purportedly lying, while his gripe is predicated on but another one of his lies. Trump has turned lying into an art form that will be arduously studied for decades. I hope, however, that at least as much effort will be directed to finding an antidote to this one thing that Trump seems to do so well."
2020-02-28 22:34,Trump and his loyalists and supporters live in an alternative reality.
2020-02-28 22:24,"Never wrote in this media. Some of you may remember that Germany is one of your Allies. Few of you may remember that one of our most beloved Chancellors was Helmut Schmidt. Even fewer of you may remember that Helmut as Mayor of Hamburg was Fighting a natural flood catastrophy in 1962 by ignoring all the rules. Her broke the constitution by asking the German Army for help. Google it, its true. I'm not at all a Panicked Person, I just returned from a Business Trip to the middle east and saw all These paranoid People. I saw your fellow citizens ignoring the threat. If the American People really feels threatened by the Virus, one should take the lead. Could be a Mayor, a Senator or anybody else who can move Things. They only shall follow their heart. Just do it, remember that the American People was not built on Building walls."
2020-02-28 22:37,"So let me get this straight.  The media is out to get Trump and Americans should just turn off their TVs to avoid being upset.  And it's not just the American media but reports from all over the world where some 50-odd countries are trying to limit the transmission of covid-19 to their citizens.

Are they all in cahoots with the American media? Poor Mr. Trump.  Someone should start marketing martyr T-shirts."
2020-02-28 22:46,"True story.  

1990, I was boarding a Delta flight from Palm Beach to New York. A very blonde child in first class accidentally hit me while I was making my way to coach.  He looked up at me with a slight scowl but a voice said ""That's not nice. Be nice."" The man next to him then put a hand up and said ""sorry"".

The man was Trump. The kid was Eric.

 Not sure why he was on a Delta flight other than he really had no private plane but whatever.

We need that other Trump. The one who apologized for his kid and was among all people. 

I'm not MAGA. I'm a regular American who feels we really need honestly and a strong and kind president at this hour."

The same cannot be said about Trump---he is incapable of admitting a mistake, has no clue what kind of crisis he is in, and has no one around him who could intelligently recommend a strategy. What we will get in the next few days/weeks is a lot of show, but no go. As a small footnote---is there a pattern to Republican incompetence---Bush left us with two wars going and a weakened economy---Trump's administration is shaping up to leave trapped in our homes and watching our retirement accounts dwindle to zero--heck of a job Trumpie."

The real victim is the republican party, which has shuffled along behind Trump since their primaries.     

I say this with the assumption that he will neither be reelected nor start a war, and I know full well that the 3+ years of his administration has been one step backward after another, a lot of wasted years.

After decades of defunding education I also hope we realize how important real, public education which gives young people the history, context and facts necessary to understand and effect government.

Trump’s pattern of deflection is not working here. Even Trump supporters don’t want this virus. Including the ones who believe it’s all the fault of Obama or Hillary or whatever.

Trump thinks the stock market millionaires and billionaires are enthralled with his business acumen. They are not. They supported his tax cuts, not the man. And now he’s compromising their portfolios via his ridiculous approach to this urgent issue. Why doesn’t he turn it all over to the CDC and WHO? No; instead his ego takes the lead. As usual."
2020-02-28 22:49,Viruses don’t lie. Trump does. Ironically he doesn’t realize that the easiest way to re election would be to put real scientists in charge of all things related to the virus rather than trying to “manage” messages.

As a school psychologist who works in a school district where keeping a sneezing or coughing child home from school is a luxury a lot of working parents can't afford, I really wanted to be reassured that our government was equipped to handle a national health crisis. 
The only good thing about Trump's responses is that he didn't slur his words for a change. I also heard some useful information about the process of developing a vaccine (as in don't expect one anytime soon), but that didn't come from Trump.  
Other than that, there was a bunch of confused statements and misleading information from Trump. He tried to blame the stock market's recent performance on the Democratic candidates, called Nancy Pelosi incompetent, gloated about his approval ratings, mocked Chuck Schumer and mimicked his NY accent, kept downplaying the seriousness of COVID-19 by comparing it to the flu, rambled on about how frequently he washes his hands, lied about the mortality rate and disputed the 2% figure, claimed (without evidence) that his Muslim travel ban has stopped the virus from spreading to the U.S., whined about being called a racist, and could not give a coherent reason for appointing Mike Pence to coordinate the administration's response to this.
I am not reassured. Not in the least."
2020-02-28 23:49,"True insanity. It's common knowledge that the president is sadly losing his desperate battle with reality, but for no-one in the White House to actually stand up for what has to be done is extraordinary. And for the Republican party, especially in the form of senators, to placidly accept it all is simply outrageous.
Mortality figures always lag: the latest (minimal) numbers from China indicate maybe 4%: much higher and we move into Spanish Flu territory.
This government gutted the CDC, and it had to reduce its external operations from over 80 to 10 countries. And the 10 don't include China. Oops: that was the first line of defence.
And as little testing has been done in the USA (last estimate: 500), with a test that appears to be compromised, of course the numbers are low: you won't find cases if you don't look for them. Unintentionally, Trump's government is doing precisely the same mistakes as China's: but the resultant rage will be even more fierce.
Potentially a lot of people could die: and the reason will lie firmly at the doorstep of the White House. Meanwhile, we can all entertain ourselves by calculating how many of Mike Pence's prayers are equivalent to a tab of Aspirin."

I agree Barron should be off limits to everyone, including Mulvaney who was using him to deflect from Trump's ineptness in responding to what is a growing crisis.  Mulvaney in blaming the news media for Trump's incompetence is blaming the messenger.  
Mulvaney did speak the truth about Trump when he reported Trump saying :  ""‘I’ve only got eight years, I’m going to get as much out of it as I can,’”  Trump has only ever been interested in what's in it for him in being President.

This is akin to his strategy of cash stripping companies he ladened with debt that could not be serviced by cash flow, and declared bankruptcy, 6 times in a row. 

The trade deficit hit record levels in direct contradiction to his suggestion tariffs would reduce the trade deficit. I guess he never considered retaliatory measures, or the fact 7 billion customers are outside US borders.

Anyone of the democratic candidates would have marshaled our many available resources to tackle this problem, rather than throw news spin to combat what surely will become a pan epidemic. With so much at risk, this administration lack of caring show incredible shallowness and indescribable selfishness."
2020-02-29 0:05,It has been 3 full days since the CDC scientists spoke about the potential crisis and then Trump appointed his assistant Pence as the czar to control messaging. After that all the news is gibberish from Micky Mulvaney and the like or attention on the stock market. Why not hold daily public briefings by scientists (under the watchful eyes of the czar if need be) and report facts instead of political / propaganda stuff.
2020-02-28 23:32,...and here we go. The Trump cult of personality is so all-consuming that - even in the middle of a global epidemic - his staff is obsessed with Trump's popularity over the health of the country.
2020-02-28 23:58,"Are you kidding me Mr. Mulvaney?  So the last time we experienced this type of economic situation was the housing crisis in 2008. Driven by sub-prime loans. Buyers that were unqualified but were grabbing for the American Dream. This is different.  Disease has no boundaries. And if the world is reacting on a global level economically, White House aides following around POTUS with hand sanitizer is not very comforting."
2020-02-29 0:41,"Trump and his clansmen will never recognize or understand the difference between politics and government. Trump, despite his squawking protestations to the contrary, is nothing but a politician, and not a particularly good one. He falls flat on his face every time the situation calls for good governance. That should be no surprise, since his core doctrine seminars from the Norquist notion of shrinking the government to a bathtub dimension.

Having a guy like Trump in charge, who values nothing but his public approval and self benefit, is incomprehension dangerous in a time of crisis. I hope they're right about this virus being a teapot-bound tempest, but if they're wrong, they have squandered valuable time needed to prepare. Trump's deflections don't inspire confidence."

The death rate in cases so far is about 2% or so, across 80K cases... it is statistically solid to project that rate going forward. That's 1,800,000 people dying.

I'm glad Mick Mulvaney is sure that the reason Democrats and 'the media' are making a big deal about this, and about the readiness of the United States to address this situation is because they want to attack Trump. I'd hate to think that only a paltry pandemic that might kill 1.8 million people was something to make a big fuss about.

I'm relieved now to know that I have nothing really to worry about, since this is all being blown up just to make Trump look bad. Funny thing is, I actually think Trump does a really good job of doing that himself, without any help from Democrats and 'the media'.

He has breached his duty to uphold the Constitution of the United States as he has ZERO regard for the rule of law or for the best interests of the American people.  

Rather than care about our health and well-being, he only paid attention to the coronavirus AFTER the stock market tumbled.

During the 2014 Ebola outbreak, 2 people died of the disease in the United States.

I remember Paul Harvey and his rest of the story. It was a time when there was no place to go to fact check.
The world has changed and I suspect we will soon see an isolated USA that tries to fix the crack that lets the truth come in.
The truth is that the world is better place than it has ever been for homo sapiens but it needs to be a whole lot better. The patriotic propaganda of 100 years has done what it was supposed to do but even gaslighting has its unintended consequences. Truth is not whatever you want to make it and the crack creates a divided country of those that know the truth and those to whom Mick Mulvaney delivers truth.
America has long survived political divides but time will tell if it can survive a truth divide.

 And of course all Trump wants to do is win the election by hook or crook, take over the country by hook or crook, get as much money and other emoluments as he can from the American taxpayer (voters) and/or foreigners by hook or crook  and show up Putin (“well, it was much, much, much harder for me”) so he can be a reigning member of The Club)."

Re:  The Corona Virus

1. This is NOT about YOU. This is about the American People.

2. You are public servants (for the time being). Therefore, YOU are SERVANTS to the American People. Not the other way around. The American people, including those who didn't vote for you, are worthy of your consideration and respect. If you disagree, learn to disagree in a mature, appropriate manner. Otherwise, you have no business being given the trust that normally comes with your offices. Stop scapegoating Democratic leaders and their constituencies.

3. Stop reacting defensively to every criticism and DO YOUR JOB! Protect the American People. Your ACTIONS will speak volumes. Your words are palaver. You also might listen to the criticisms and learn from them. That's what a true leader does. Your behavior is like a 6-year old's continual temper tantrum.

4. When Trump decimated the federal Center for Disease Control, he undermined our nation's ability to anticipate, meet, and effectively deal with pandemics such as the Corona Virus. That action speaks for itself. It shows that Trump has failed to protect the American people as well as those on the front lines fighting for patients:  doctors, nurses, and allied healthcare professionals. Trump's actions have endangered the health and safety of all.

Trump and his brigade of morons are bungling the response, lashing out and scapegoating perceived political enemies and totally mismanaging the government's response in the worst way possible. This is the objective truth of the situation we find ourselves in. Trump and executive branch cronies are intellectually incapable of managing this complex problem because they lack any educational training in public health, government management, effective public communications, international relations, diplomacy or any other relevant field to manage this crisis. They are CPAC strutting around like buffoons right now. Imagine if Obama had responded to Deepwater Horizon by going to Netroots Nation and blaming the GOP. That these taxpayer paid stooges are also morally bankrupt makes it even worse. They don't care if people die as long as they keep their plum jobs and power.

When a virus infects you it doesn't care if you're Republican or Democrat, if you're rich or poor, if you're healthy or ill; it has no interest in global financial  markets.

True.  And this is nothing new.  Also, look at the comments here in NYT, the people almost blame Trump for the virus, the hatred for Trump never knew any boundaries.

As for covid-19, USA is in fact uniquely well positioned to withstand it since it is protected by the oceans.  The vigilance is more than in place, awareness too, but let us not sow panic, it is by all intents and purposes life as usual here, in sharp contrast to the large parts of the world.

2020-02-29 20:54,"The following is from the report of the World Health Organization team that recently returned from a trip to China. How is the US measuring up? 
“For countries with imported cases and/or outbreaks of COVID-19
1. Immediately activate the highest level of national Response Management protocols to ensure the all-of-government and all-of-society approach needed to contain COVID-19 with non-pharmaceutical public health measures;
2. Prioritize active, exhaustive case finding and immediate testing and isolation, painstaking contact tracing and rigorous quarantine of close contacts;
3. Fully educate the general public on the seriousness of COVID-19 and their role in preventing its spread;
4. Immediately expand surveillance to detect COVID-19 transmission chains, by testing all patients with atypical pneumonias, conducting screening in some patients with upper respiratory illnesses and/or recent COVID-19 exposure, and adding testing for the COVID-19 virus to existing surveillance systems (e.g. systems for influenza-like-illness and SARI); and
5. Conduct multi-sector scenario planning and simulations for the deployment of even more stringent measures to interrupt transmission chains as needed (e.g. the suspension of large-scale gatherings and the closure of schools and workplaces).”
So far I am not encouraged. The “all-of-society” and “all-of-government” approach that has shown some success in China seems pretty unlikely in this country, even if we were at our best."
2020-02-29 20:55,"Number of cases is getting confusing. Washington State is about to announce new local cases but CDC, being rightfully careful, won’t announce them until they do their own confirmation. Seems to be a good process but is causing a lot of angst out here."
2020-02-29 20:55,"We need more answers. What is the cost to patients to get tested? Will we be bankrupted by hospital costs? Are private companies making test kits going to charge a bundle and profit off of the Coronavirus, and if so, won’t that make the epidemic worse? Most people do not have more than $400 in the bank for emergencies. Please get this straight."
2020-02-29 20:44,Get Pence out of the picture if you want the public to be reassured. Put experts and scientists in charge of managing the near-pandemic. The world doesn't care who is loyal to Trump and who isn't. The people care about how safe they are with this threat hovering over them and people who know nothing are in charge of the management of the crisis. Get the scientists out on the Sunday morning talk shows instead of the Trump mouth pieces.

Strutting around beating his breast at rallies and barking about keeping Chinese out wasn't so effective anymore since disease doing pretty well on its own, plus there are new groups of foreigners we can blame.

2020-02-29 20:53,"With the number of coronavirus cases expanding across the West Coast including the first U.S. fatality, how reassuring to learn that Trump has tightened travel restrictions on Iran! As they say, we can rest assured that the Commander-in-Chief is “closing the barn door now that the horse has escaped.” It’s time to unmuzzle the health care experts like Dr. Anthony Fauci at the National Institutes of Health and muzzle Trump and all his loyalist who are turning a scary situation into a panic of uncertainty with their irresponsible comments and ineffective actions."
2020-02-29 20:59,"Whelp. Jackson High School, where the student tested positive, is 3 miles from my house. My pregnant wife was just at Evergreen Health Hospital on Thursday for routine prenatal care. This is where the patient died today. Needless to say: “community transmission” just took on new meaning. 

I thought we would have a few more weeks, maybe months...

Listen to the CDC folks. It’s time to prepare."
2020-02-29 21:08,"So why isn’t Trump claiming the media exaggerated this woman’s death? Not that this can be avoided, but perhaps now we can understand the urgency of preparation recommended by WHO. A virus for which none of us have any natural immunity and which may be mutating as it progresses across the globe as influenza does, is a ticking time bomb. Please take precautions everyone. And if you don’t think your at risk, there are many of us who are, so keep that in mind."
2020-02-29 21:11,"I want to know what the CDC knows and not what Washington is telling us. This virus is here and it is migrating. As a person of this country I am looking for sound advice and guidance, not political rhetoric for the next election."
2020-02-29 21:12,"This is Trump's first crisis that is not self-inflicted or made-up, and he is is bungling it in spectacular fashion.  His appointment of Pence to manage it signals he sees this as a political crisis, not a health crisis. This will be his Katrina and unfortunately people will die because of his administration's incompetence.  When will his loyal followers wake up?"
2020-02-29 21:14,"Trump's policy makes no sense whatsoever. Ban travel from Iran (500  cases), but only serious warning insofar as Italy is concerned (1,100  cases) or Japan (900  cases). Only a complete ban of all international travel will slow the disease spreading which is probably infeasible. Every day, people are crossing European boarders and getting on airplanes. Most people who are infected have mild symptoms and may be unaware they are contagious. It is ludicrous to suggest that selectivel restriction of travel from a few hotspots will minimize the problem. I'm afraid this is going to get a lot worse before it gets better."
2020-02-29 21:15,"Turns out the patient who died was a male, not a female,  as Trump announced. Is it too much to ask of the president to have a basic detailed information about this crisis?"
2020-02-29 21:16,"Wouldn’t it be comforting to know that every single person in America had some kind of health insurance right now?

And equally reassuring that even the undocumented wouldn’t be fearful about going to a hospital if they thought they might be sick?

Unfortunately neither is true! When both would be a godsend."
2020-02-29 21:17,"Covid-19 is in the US. Will travel restrictions help at this point? Not likely!  As soon a the orange President appointed Mike Pence to to “lead” the response I made sure my will was in order.  Whenever I get to the point where I think Trump can’t say anything more ignorant than things he has said in the past, I am again shocked when he opens his mouth.
Let’s try a comprehensive public health response led by scientists and Doctors."
2020-02-29 21:34,"How about requiring every airline provide face masks to every passenger on all flights, domestic and international.
They reduce transmission and to a lesser extent contagion."
2020-02-29 21:35,"It doesn't square the administration's claims that the response has been very proactive and indeed aggressive. The outbreaks in Italy, South Korea and Iran have been growing all week. Why did he went until today for this travel advisories/restrictions when it should have been done earlier this week? This chasing the ball of string strategy does not inspire confidence."
2020-02-29 21:35,"First and foremost, condolences to her family and friends. When people become statistics, it becomes too easy to forget the suffering involved."
2020-02-29 21:36,"Right now watching Seattle/King County's public health staff giving press conference as more cases are showing up here. So much more reassuring to hear from them than from Trump's team. Good public communication is so essential. 

Trump spread wrong information this morning: the death out here was a man, not a woman. How could they make such a very basic mistake in checking facts. Seriously."
2020-02-29 21:38,"I would like to say: if, in 12-18 months, there is a safe and effective vaccine against coronavirus, I sincerely hope that after all the havoc coronavirus has wreaked, we don't hear the usual anti-vaccination noise we've gotten too used to hearing. No arm-flailing, pearl-clutching, kicking, or screaming over supposed causation/correlation unsupported by scientific evidence. (That's for the Andrew Wakefields and Jenny McCarthys of the world).  I hope people will think harder about when they procrastinate on, decline, or otherwise fail to get the basic flu vaccine and other age-recommended vaccines.  I hope the ""anti-vaxx"" crowd doesn't try to dissuade people from getting a coronavirus vaccine, because we may be stuck reliving this.  I hope the uproar over vaccines that has taken root over the last 2 decades finally gives way to common sense recognition of the damage wrought when we have epidemics and pandemics.  Maybe we learn something about the stakes in public health from Coronavirus and its toll on lives, health, peace of mind, healthcare facilities and infrastructure, businesses, and economies. I would venture a guess that people who lived during the prime days of measles and polio would agree with me."
2020-02-29 21:41,"People keep using the 1918 flu pandemic for comparison, but I wonder how directly useful those numbers are now. This was at a time before we had a regular flu vaccine, and I suspect that the quality of hospital treatment and support for seriously ill has gotten significantly better. The 19!8 pandemic is a good example of how deadly such a disease can be, but a direct comparison to  flu today is probably not valid. It does provide a warning about the potential for covid19, since there is not yet a vaccine for it."
2020-02-29 21:42,"Per the CDC, some new cases in Washington state are centered around a long-term care facility.  Numerous residents and staffers showing symptoms. This could be tragic. Many vulnerable people in such a place."
2020-02-29 21:52,"It's alarming that the 1918 flu epidemic continued to spread through the summer months and accelerated the following fall and winter, contrary to the usual decline of seasonal flu as temperatures warm. If the current virus outbreak doesn't subside in the next couple of months, we're likely facing dire impacts on the U.S. health-care system and severe economic and social disruptions. In effect, covid-19 itself will likely decide our fate, regardless of mitigation attempts at containment. We should look to what happens in the southern hemisphere in the coming weeks (now in late summer) for clues to our future.
One hopes that career experts in the federal government won't be impeded by political hacks."
2020-02-29 21:52,It appears that the Government is preparing to deploy N-95 level masks beyond those needed for health care workers. Trump announced that we have on hand 40 million such masks now and will be manufacturing 35 million per month. The only way those numbers make sense (assuming he is not lying) is if wide scale distribution of masks is anticipated. This makes sense since Covid19 is primarily spread through the air. Why not make some of those high level masks available now to high risk people in areas where there is community spread?
2020-02-29 21:54,"Covid 19 has already reached our shores, so restricting travel is akin to closing the barn door after the horse has escaped. While a direct comparison in number of cases & mortality to the Spanish flu that raged across the world may be off base, the lessons learned could be helpful."
2020-02-29 21:16,"China is responsible for the trillions in economic losses around the world. This is a strange and artificially created virus. The fact that children seem strangely unaffected, especially when they can mount a stronger immune response to any viral infection is indicative of an anomaly. To portray China as heroic in it’s response is an effort by their government to cover up their monumental failures in containment, cleanliness, hygiene and a disrespect towards their own citizens. This virus is something no human has been exposed to. There is no herd immunity. No one anywhere has ever seen it before. Hence all who are exposed to this virus will react to it. Some may react mildly, in others there will be a spectrum of effects as with any disease. So far it has behaved in an attenuated way. There is no point in avoiding the obvious, that the virus is there everywhere, so avoiding it is impossible. I suggest the larger and more serious numbers reflect the hygiene levels of a country. To keep the us safe in the USA,  I suggest, we look at our personal and communal levels of hygiene. Only then can we, even if infected simply breeze through this organism. If the CDC had any presence of mind, they would be circulating simple posters for all public institutions. I suggest they should be cautioning susceptible people to take precautions to be extra hygienic and avoid large gatherings. The rest of us, need to eat healthy, take vitamins, hydrate, and avoid sharing food."
2020-02-29 21:19,I’d be far more convinced I don’t need to worry if a doctor was telling me I’ll be fine. President Trump? Not so much.
2020-02-29 21:25,"Meanwhile, back in DC, the Republicans and most Democrats will continue to argue that we cannot afford Medicare for All, and the GOP will continue its mission to shrink government down  to the size that they can drown it in a bathtub.

""I've got mine and the rest of you are on your own"" is no way to run a country."
2020-02-29 21:37,The taxpayers have supported the structure to protect us in these situations. So where is it? The Republicans are like renters who've moved into a house and are selling off everything that isn't nailed down

2020-02-29 21:37,"World Meters Data - Italy has tested around 10,000 people.  Currently around 1100 cases in a population of 60million.  We are pretty tranquil as the health care system works and everyone can cooperate and call
the doctor. We get reports updated hourly by the Health Minister and others regarding the outbreak. 

Sure there are some bumps and bothersome politics, but, we know what is going on. The reason Americans don’t come is because if they came down with the virus here (which has a really low probability), they would have to stay until cured. 

USA has about 500 tested and around 70 cases from what I see on the World Meters data."
2020-02-29 21:41,"Maybe  other countries around the world should ban incoming traffic from the U.S.A. until the dimension of the  spread of the virus  is understood. How many people are ""really"" infected in the U.S.A., where are the testing centers?  
Italy has responded to the situation and has provided reliable datas and zones of containment , what about here?"
2020-02-29 21:52,"It is unfortunate, but many comments in this section
are on the level of online Fox News users, tuning urgent and serious medical situation into political discussion on low intellectual level. Obviously Trump is absolutely the worst US President to deal with this situation, but the whole  heath care system here  is ill prepared to deal with it and we are talking here about decades of neglect.We are deluding ourselves if we think that vaccine or newly developed medication will deal with it, even if so , it will take few years to develop. I really feel that USA is uniquely unsuited to address epidemic of Covid-19 on many levels. CDC couldn’t figure out up till now that we need to test more people that several a week and that we are not a chosen nation and that virus may already be here. I don’t feel that local community institutions, hospitals, schools, clinics, urgent care units are adequately prepared for it or have  developed meaningful guidelines to address the situation. On top of that people with mild symptoms will be reluctant to seek medical attention, and why should they if they are not even going to be tested, and will be spreading the infection. I work in a large hospital, which up till now didn’t give me any assurance, guidelines, information about anything related to Covid-19, with an exception of an email stating that we are expecting shortage of masks and other medical supplies!"
2020-02-29 21:53,"Watching the news conference from Seattle, including State and County health officials and medical experts.  The misinformation from the Trump political machine is staggering.

First, the decedent was a man, not a woman.
Second, although she appeared at the emergency room with severe respiratory distress, there is no evidence that she was originally a high-risk patient.
Third, this is not a ""hoax"", either scientifically or from the Democrats.  The numbers are escalating and neither facts, science nor medical histories are being fudged.  This is Trump's first opportunity to show some leadership and he dumps it on Pence, whom he will dispatch back to Indiana before he takes any responsibility for his own missteps.
Fourth, the decedent had nothing to do with the long-term care facility that features the outbreak among two dozen residents and care givers.  Totally different.

It is pretty clear that Trump wants to minimize the danger--""it will be gone by April when the weather warms up""--and/or to place the problem beyond his responsibility by establishing travel bans to Italy, Korea, Iran and elsewhere.  He mentioned the southern border, then walked that back, but it is clear he is floundering for excuses.

Trump is a crisis independent of the virus itself."
2020-02-29 22:08,"The trump administration has turned out to be a very unreliable messenger concerning the Coronavirus. As an example the trump administration's top economic adviser, Larry Kudlow, offered this gem: “Stocks look pretty cheap to me.""

SO:

Cancel all flights to play golf.
Save money. Save lives."
2020-02-29 21:45,"Here’s a suggestion:  
STOP traveling overseas for the foreseeable future!

Do your business remotely. Cancel you Italian culinary tour.  You can learn how to make fresh mozzarella and gelato another time. And it’s certainly not worth risking your own and everyone else’s life.

Stay in your own countries...at least until the virus is contained. Is that so difficult?"
2020-02-29 21:34,Trump talks about 15 cases but we see that there are many more than that in our country.  Why is he always misinformed?  Is it on purpose?
2020-02-29 22:12,"Maybe this will encourage American manufacturers to start producing goods in the United States again...hiring American workers.

2020-02-29 21:37,"The Coronavirus doesn’t care ideology, religion, race, friends or foes, rich or poor! Why we are placing more stringent travel restrictions on Iran where the travel flow to the US is much less significant, while we are still keeping the travel flow from South Korea where the virus is spreading worse than anywhere else now.  What the US government is doing doesn’t make sense and disgusting."
2020-02-29 22:03,"I wouldn't assume Covid 19 is spread primarily through the air because our ""stable genius"" is planning on increasing mask manufacturing; after all, he stated that the woman who died near Seattle was ""wonderful"", when in fact, she wasn't even a ""she.""

Condolences to the family of the woman who passed away in Seattle, but how was Trump to know she was “wonderful” having never met her? Just give the straightforward description of her as a “medically compromised woman in her 50s” and leave out the meaningless editorializing.

2020-02-29 21:39,"I am very reassured that Trump has put an evangelist in charge of this pandemic. This means everyone will be prayed for. Who needs science anyway when you have prayer? As Trump said in India, it's under control in America."

That was the purpose of Doublethink in 1984- in the end, the truth was so obscured by misinformation, only Big Brother could tell you what the truth was, and that could be different from minute to minute, depending on what his purposes were."
2020-02-29 21:23,"Last evening at his Rally he said the Virus was a ""Hoax"".  Today he is putting travel restrictions.  And, Pence allowed the Scientists and Health Officials to speak which is more credible than Trump or Pence.  They both tell so many lies we cannot believe a word they say.  Now with the Doctors being censored by Pence who was disastrous in Indiana with the HIV epidemic, we may not even be able to believe them"
2020-02-29 21:29,"Trump has no cred, be it in the streets or in the suites."
2020-02-29 22:21,New York and California governors said yesterday that they  don't have adequate testing kits so do we really believe we have accurate data?
2020-02-29 21:45,"Though I avoid watching Trump on TV, I watched the press briefing, curious to see how they would handle it. Seeing Pence and the other Presidential minions continually insert praise for the Great Leader into their comments made me feel I was watching state TV in North Korea. Appalling."
2020-02-29 22:02,"Trump administration handled the situation terribly this week. To say that democrats were spreading bad rumors was comparing the coronavirus to the flu showed the American people that Trump is ignorant and clueless. 

This is already a pandemic since the cases and deaths in Italy and Iran. It is ridiculous the WHO and CDC delayed the pandemic declaration. It will probably come as early as Monday. 

The United States should close borders with Italy, Iran, and South Korea. Government should order mandatory ramp up of production of protective gear and ICU equipment. The government should allocate $5 billion or more asap. This is not a joke!"
2020-02-29 21:21,"So, as I see it, Trump is now responsible for the first death from a “hoax.”  This is likely a direct result of the utter incompetence of the administration and their super human job of containment.  Likely she contracted the virus after they sent untrained, improperly protected workers to evacuate Americans.  Against the CDC, they put infected individuals on planes with hundreds uninflected, and then They allowed the workers disburse throughout this country!  If that isn’t enough, they’ve had months to ramp up test kits, but still have none to disburse that work!  And guidelines not only prevent immediate testing of anyone, but they won’t even allow states with working tests to use them!  So this lady, and possibly many others, likely spread and are spreading the disease to many others, including staff at the hospitals where she was treated before testing.  Meanwhile they’ve tested less than 500 individuals, while other civilized countries have tested hundreds of thousands!  So we don’t even know how bad this is!  And Trump and Pence are, naturally, focusing all their time on handling this pandemic-by holding rallies and attending fund raisers!  But not to worry, this is only one death.  As Trump says, the whole thing will miraculously just disappear.  So just take the advice of Mulvaney and turn off the television, or as Kudlow says, buy stock.  Because really, Trump and the band of incompetents running this country only care about one thing.  And it’s not public health."
2020-02-29 21:28,"One key reason why the US successfully avoided pandemics  in recent decades is that the respective administrations in charge weren't boneheaded enough to cut funding for public health agencies like the CDC below the absolute minimum required to function.  This current one did just that. It's like underfunding your fire department; eventually, there is a fire, and then, disaster can strike. The problem with something like this is that you can't spin or lie your way out of them."
2020-02-29 22:04,"Last Saturday, there were 50 confirmed cases in Italy- 1 week later, over 1,000.

  Our friend spoke to his neighbor who has a Chinese brother in law, in China. He's a cardiologist that is not allowed to leave the country but he told his family here that there are thousands dead in the streets and trucks are just driving around picking up the dead.  I'd rather have the truth than read about people saying not to panic.

  Furthermore, I do not believe the news coming from China that they have anything under control.  I wouldn't travel for all the rice in China."
2020-02-29 22:14,"My condolences to the young man, or middle aged woman, who was the first victim of this virus in the US. I'm not a medical doctor but I might be able to help this administraion with proper identification. Aside from that, everything's under control. Terrific control."

From the C-Span transcript (I apologize for the all caps):

THE PRESIDENT AUTHORIZED ACTION TO ADD ADDITIONAL TRAVEL RESTRICTIONS ON IRAN. WE WILL BE BANNING TRAVEL FROM IRAN. IRAN IS ALREADY UNDER A TRAVEL BAN, BUT WE ARE EXPANDING EXISTING TRAVEL RESTRICTIONS TO INCLUDE ANY FOREIGN NATIONAL WHO HAS VISITED IRAQ IN THE LAST 14 DAYS. IN ADDITION TO -- IRAN IN THE LAST 14 DAYS. 

IN ADDITION, WE WILL INCREASE TO THE HIGHEST LEVEL ADVISORY, LEVEL FOUR, ADVISING AMERICANS TO NOT TRAVEL TO SPECIFIC REGIONS IN ITALY AND SOUTH KOREA. LET ME SAY AGAIN. THE PRESIDENT AUTHORIZED THE STATE DEPARTMENT TO INCREASE THE TRAVEL ADVISORY FOR AMERICANS TO LEVEL FOUR. WE WE ARE ADVISING AMERICANS NOT TO TRAVEL TO AREAS IN ITALY AND SOUTH KOREA MOST AFFECTED BY THE CORONAVIRUS.

Of course, our POTUS was having a great time insulting and demeaning people like Mayor Bloomberg and Sen. Warren at CPAC. Trump has lowered the respect we worked on for two centuries from ALL of the leaders, enemies or friends, of other countries. 

I can only imagine what Rush and Sean would have said if Obama or Hillary had done anything similar."
2020-02-29 22:14,"Last I looked there are 65 confirmed cases of COVID-19.  You have to have one of the very scarce test kits to be confirmed.  They don't test everyone that gets sick, not enough test kits.

2020-02-29 22:20,"There are two ""illnesses"" here: one is the physiological corona virus, and the other is a mistaken belief that if you are not in a high risk group... then you don't have anything to worry about. Sadly, both are ""communicable"" (read: transmissible). The truth is that if you are young and/or health but get a ""mild case"" of the virus you are just as much of an agent of contagion than a ""high risk person."" Maybe more. Why? Well, a sick person is more likely to seek treatment. Someone who is healthy but only has an occasional sneeze or cough... or who does not wash his hands... is just as contagious as the person who seeks treatment, only the healthy person is transmitting by stealth. This puts people who are ""at risk"" in Higher risk, and makes the epidemic spread further, faster.  If you are feeling immune... or invincible... or cavalier, please don a conscience. It's not about you or us vs. them. We are all in this boat together, sink or swim."

We can assume it’s in every metropolitan area of the country if it’s in Portland and Seattle, far from the Air Force bases where people were quarantined.  And numbers will go up dramatically over the next week like we’ve seen elsewhere in the world.  Trump needs to prepare hospital workers and make test kits widely available.  Oh, and stop saying this is a hoax on the part of the Democrats and the media.  We can plainly see what’s happening in Europe and South Korea and the Democrats have nothing to do with it."
2020-02-29 22:27,Travel restrictions? That is Trump's answer to everything. How about some corona virus test kits and protective equipment for care givers? Those are the things that our doctors say they need.

Adams, said in a tweet on Saturday morning. “They are NOT effective in preventing general public from catching #Coronavirus, but if health care providers can’t get them to care for sick patients, it puts them and our communities at risk!”

Why waring masks is a good thing for the health care providers but not the general public once the virus spread gets worse. It is apparent that there is very serious shortage of masks in the country.  To be prepared, the US government needs to mobilize our industry (what’s ever left here) to manufacture more masks as war measures urgently!"
2020-02-29 22:44,"Trump and his team of ""experts"" say the person who died is a woman.   It was a man.  If they can not get simple details correct; how can we trust them on the big things?   Besides; putting a few travel restrictions on is nothing; how many Americans planned to fly to Iran on vacation?    We know the infection is in Italy and S Korea; travel bookings have plummeted.  Trump admin has done as close to zero as you can get.    43 million masks?   We had 30 million on Dec 1; so not impressive."

Isolation ->  Hygiene -> Diagnose -> Quarantine
Protect and supply the health care workers that give supportive care.  They reduce the death rate, which may be about 3.3% of those infected

A high degree of concern and precaution is appropriate - panic brings on irrational, destructive, bigoted behavior as we have seen..  Responsible leaders know this.    

Of course Trump(R) is worried - this is having an impact on all our lives; just as Obama(D) was worried about Ebola (without this degree of panic and not in an election year)  - Both are taking the same steps at the same speed.  

100 years ago..Truman (D) was not worried until way too late, not taking early steps to limit the disease - leading to a 10%-20% death rate for millions due to the inability to give supportive care to such a large number of infected."

With all the Russian disinformation permeating the ether here in the US -- and feverishly fueling attempts by Mr. Trump's opponents to politicize this health ""crisis"" -- anything that to US can do to limit the arrival of foreigners who might be carrying the virus is positive it seems to me. 

Not that this ""crisis"" is really all that worrisome.  Coronavirus has about the same ability to spread as the common flu.  I'm more worried about traffic accidents."

2020-02-29 23:58,"Physician here.

It looks as if a number of folks have gotten Covid-19 at a care facility in the Puget Sound area.  Test results will be in soon.   

If community spread has occurred, and I think it has, isolation of known cases will not completely stop the epidemic because we would have infectious well-appearing people in the community.  Social distancing now becomes essential.

Social distancing measures like closing schools and workplaces will decrease the total number of cases, and, crucially, allow the health care system to cope better as cases are spread out over time instead of coming in overwhelming numbers all at once.

Check the websites of your local and state public health departments regularly. Remember cough etiquette, hand washing, and physical distancing. 

No need to panic.  Most Covid-19 cases are mild.  Take things one step at a time."
2020-02-29 22:20,"Didn't I hear Trump make some nasty aside during the Q+A that ""the Democrats couldn't even count thier votes in Iowa"" when asked about the hoax comment ? (Paraphrasing...)


Sounds like the Republicans can't even figure out if it's a man or a woman that died from Coronavirus in Seattle.... I have some pictures I could send to Mike Pence to help him, or maybe he could look in one of those doctor-books that the CDC has ( that is, if his wife will let him look at dirty pictures of naked women...)

That being said, I still remain open to giving him credit where it is due; I don't think he has mishandled this COVID-19 crisis, I thought his mid-week press conference was very appropriate, his early banning of China travel wise and his selection of Anthony Fauci to help lead the scientific effort, excellent. And I certainly want Trump to succeed during this crisis, for the benefit of us all. I don't want the very media that criticizes Trump for politicizing serious matters, now doing just that, and making a spectacle of every misspoken word or comment he is prone to make. Give the man a chance to help us deal with potentially the most serious health crisis most of us have faced in our lifetimes, won't you?"

In a crisis like this, he’s in way over his head.  I listen to professionals — scientists, doctors, emergency personnel — who know what they’re doing through experience and education.  Straight facts, clearly stated, that’s what I want.  I’ll read The Times and The Post, and the CDC website.  I don’t have time for silly White House games.  I care too much about my mom in her 90s, and the rest of my family."
2020-02-29 23:57,"Less than 500 tests had been done in the US as of Feb. 28 due to lack of testing capability, now only increasing. As of Feb. 27, only 200 testing kits were available in CA according to to Gov. Newsom.  Early test kits were faulty. So of course, we have no idea how many people may be infected especially that 80% have no or mild symptoms. Also, people can transmit infections when asymptomatic. 

The whistleblower reports that the HHS workers caring for the evacuees from Wuhan and the Diamond Princess were not protected then got on commercial jets. This may have been one source of the spread. The first community case reported was in Solano County home of Travis AFB. 

Why no Federal leadership to deal with this health emergency? Trump: 
1. Cut the CDC’s budget 3 yrs in a row
2. Fired the pandemic response team at HHS
3. Fired the pandemic response team at DHS
4. Fired the NSC coordinator for global pandemic events"
2020-02-29 23:36,"I am convinced that the coronavirus is more wide spread than they first thought and the fatality rate is grossly exaggerated, because they are only tracking the sickest patients.

2020-03-01 0:28,Well it may help but the travel restrictions probably are too late to have prevented the entry of infected people. The disease is communicable before any symptoms are presented.

2020-03-01 0:28,"65 CONFIRMED cases but there has been little testing in the U.S.   Surely there are hundreds of actual cases.  Let us hope that most are mild.  I am heartened by the claim, which I hope is accurate, that children tend to get mild cases.

Anyway..wash those hands, and train yourself not to touch your face with your hands."
2020-03-01 0:34,"The rates of bad outcomes is significant but still in the low single digits. The risk is the extent of the spread. The more infected the more chance of mutations which can change the seriousness of the infections. The Spanish Flu turned deadly because it swept through the soldiers in the trenches on the western front and mutated into a deadly strain.

This coronavirus is but just one example of the disastrous repercussions of Trump GOP extremist policies which we will all suffer. The next wave of crises such as global warming and crumbling infrastructure will only further destroy our communities because Trump GOP are completely blind to these huge issues.

Emphasizing how ""mild"" the illness will be for most will result in greater spread of the virus to those who will become critically ill or die. We don't need to encourage that fortunate 80% of the population to be cavalier with hygiene, social distancing and other containment and mitigation efforts because they will be the carriers responsible for the illness and deaths in the remaining 20% of the population.

Ladies and gentlemen, this is who is in charge of your Federal government. In addition to incoherent and highly politicized statements, the Trump Administration has slashed the very CDC staffing year after year that would be invaluable in a pandemic.

I suppose I can't fault Trump's speech writers for attempting to prevent panic and some unjustified confidence in his actions so far and in the future. Maybe he will match his ""great"" response to Hurricane Maria and we will all be safe. 

It seems ironic, however, that most of Trump's political success is based upon instilling panic in his base, especially against the invading hords of rapists and gang members in caravans with children from the south. If the tables were turned and this was happening under a Democratic administration, I suspect his lines would be quite different.

I'm particularly reassured by the lower death rate compared to Ebola and SARS that he and his underlings keep repeating, telling us not to worry if we contract the virus if we are healthy (and have health insurance).  Oops...I'm 75  (estimated 7 1/2 % risk of death for 70-80, and 15% mortality over 80) , but I guess we don't count.  If healthy, don't worry, be happy!

The NYTimes and other media reported two days ago that a whistleblower has reported that workers supporting the people in quarantine were not provided with protective gear and were not properly trained. They have also returned to their homes, giving the opportunity for the virus to be passed on into the country at large.

Apart from saying they will investigate, there has been no response from government officials.Why? Every person exposed needs to go into voluntary quarantine for two weeks. China took the drastic action needed and the number of infections is going down. If the same isn’t done in the US, the virus could soon be beyond control."
2020-03-01 1:38,"I was embarrassed by President Trump’s news conference today and I’m not even American! How does it feel to the family and friends of the gentleman who died of coronavirus near Seattle when the President can’t even get the gender of the deceased person right and spreads false “facts” about the victim? The world is well aware of President Trump’s disdain for facts. Instead he has a quasi-mystical belief in his instincts. But facts matter. And they matter most especially in times of acute crisis. 

Advising people to keep calm when the government doesn’t appear to have any clearly thought out strategy for deaiing with an outbreak of covid-19 within its own borders is asking a bit much. This is not 1918. Keeping people in the dark is not a workable strategy.

China was slow to recognise what was happening in Wuhan and that delay in acting allowed things to get badly out of hand. The rest of the world doesn’t have the same excuses. It was obvious where all of this was going by late January. The U.S. and many other governments have had over a month to draw valuable lessons from the experience of China and, in particular, Singapore and to develop and modify plans accordingly during a very critical time - yet clearly this hasn't happened. 

Travel restrictions are sensible but that horse bolted long ago. The real risk has now shifted out into the community although the President and his officials still seem in denial about this. That is truly frightening."
2020-03-01 1:28,"One thing that the Chinese government announced, regardless of how you feel about that government, is that all hospital bills related to the coronavirus will be covered by the government.

Nothing Trump and Trumpians say is true or factual  and are destroying what’s left of the country, thanks to Michael Bloomberg's Wall Street friends to begin with.

2020-03-01 2:17,"We can’t react to the Corona virus or any other public health threat out of fear. We must act out of a plan. 

But America had a plan for how the U.S. government would work in an epidemic and a pandemic. How it would coordinate with the state governments. We had training exercises for doctors and nurses all over America so that when an epidemic would arrive we had a chain of command. Everyone knew where to send samples. Everyone knew which governmental agencies were responsible for what. 

President Barack Obama had set up that organization after the 2014 worldwide Ebola outbreak when Obama realized that the multiple U.S. government departments and agencies were not speaking to one another or coordinating effectively. 

That’s all gone now thanks to the Trump administration’s singular mission to overturn every single program implemented under Obama. They failed at torpedoing Obamacare, so now they are chipping away at parts of Obamacare. Just what we need in the midst of a pandemic.

And what has Trump done? He appoints Mike Pence, “Space Force Guy”, to oversee America’s response to the virus. Pence is the same guy who literally said he would Pray for HIV people and their disease would go away through prayer."

I do not trust this Administration because they constantly lie.

The more trump and his flunkies deflect the more the markets will go down (and the higher the risk for the public — but he cares less for people than the markets). 

It’s worth noting that trump has two core audiences who voted for him; uneducated whites (base), and rich whites (tax cut beneficiaries). 

The base will believe whatever he says and why wouldn’t they. 

The Wall Street whites will keep selling and driving the market down because they know realize he cannot manage a crisis, and so what good is having someone who’ll give you tax cuts if the value of your portfolio is sinking by meaningful multiples.

The US needs to arrange and publicize free testing especially in the areas where the cases have been identified.

By the time a person shows up in an ER sick, gets a chest X-ray showing pneumonia, and a negative flu test, where the providers will start to think mmmm maybe this is Coronavirus, that person will have already infected dozens of other people. The person should be tested at government expense before they are actually brought into the hospital, so that if they are infected with COVID19 they can be placed in proper respiratory isolation.

CDC filed the patent in 2004 (sic).
The 'virus' referred to is SARS - which is also a member of the coronavirus family. Not Covid-19.

What should have been long ago obvious to even the most obtuse among us has only now entered the mindset of President Trump. Yesterday, at another of his interminable rallies, the president accused the Democrats and news media of trying to create a panic and of fostering a ""hoax"" on everyone over the coronavirus. Today, after evidently taking the advice of vastly more knowledgeable people, which would be anyone with a proclivity toward critical thought, he is edging closer to a semblance of a rational, comprehensive response to this worldwide calamity. Let's hope it's the beginning of a coherent plan and not more of his usual subterfuge."

Is it possible that the very goods we import from China can harbor viruses that can infect the people who handle them?  Such a possibility could explain the illness in people who have no contacts with people who
have visited hot spots.

We have so many businesses with just in time supply chains that a long lived virus able to survive outside a living host is not an implausible way of disease spread.  Surely  science   is looking into this possibility."

Who would take time out in a growing national crises to bully the Fed Chairman to lower interest rates to the point of being negative ?

Shouldn't he have been asking the nation's biotech companies to form a consortium to mass produce the coronavirus detection kits

What about putting forth a plan that would help the uninsured or residents who live in healthcare deserts get testing or medical assistance?

How about condemning the hoarding and price gouging of N95 masks that are needed for  our hospitals and healthcare workers

But rather than being a leader  who reassures the public:

He used this time to take potshots at Powell.

He used his time to talk about refinancing the countries debt....like it was a bankrupt company

2020-03-01 4:44,"The press has yet to clearly & LOUDLY call out the testing element when reporting the number of ""cases.""

Countries testing more widely have more cases.  Countries doing very limited testing, like the US, have very few cases.  Anytime you read an article about the number of cases they are referring to cases confirmed by a very specialized lab test many areas don't have, including the bulk of the US.  South Korea is testing aggressively, hence they have more cases.  Mexico has almost none.  

Testing criteria in the US is so limited, the CDC has only processed about 500 in total since January 21st.  CA & WA are now testing independently.  NY announced they will do the same.  States are taking it upon themselves because the CDC either doesn't have the will or the know-how to create and distribute reliable tests and their criteria are limited to people who've traveled to certain countries, we're on the cruise ship, or are in critical condition and have tested negative for every other known virus.  They will not test anyone else.  Hence the explosion of cases being seen in Washington (my home state) since they started doing their own testing.

It was journalistic negligence two weeks ago not to include a sentence or two explaining this reality every single time they report the number of ""cases.""  Occasionally using the word confirmed isn't enough.  If someone has pneumonia & tests negative for flu, they have COVID19.  PERIOD.

At this point, I'm disgusted by our ""Free Press."""

2020-03-01 8:00,"I think the US can take a lesson from Taiwan, which was denied entry by the WHO because the Chinese intervened politically. At the start of the epidemic back in mid January, when people started to buy out facemasks, instead of just telling people this is a “hoax” and we should not wear masks, the government set up a task force of MEDICAL and PUBLIC HEALTH professionals and conscripted all facemask factories in Taiwan so they can oversee the production of necessary equipment for hospitals and clinics. Facemasks are now RATIONED so that everyone can buy 2 a week for use in public places or when taking public transportation. I disagree that masks are useless as the disease can spread even during incubation period before one even develops symptoms. If I am carrying the virus, my wearing a mask might not protect me but will protect everyone around me. The key is to manage supply so that people who need it the most can get it. False reassurances such as what Trump and Pence said do nothing to allay panic."

Does anyone remember the H1N1 Pandemic of 2009? I admit I didn’t.

12,000 Americans died from it and the WHO estimates between 175000 and 575,000 died worldwide. Other recent Pandemics include Ebola, 12000 dead and HIV aids, 35 million dead.

To date, 1 American and 2800 are dead worldwide, all but 800 in a single province in China who now seem to have it contained and it was totally unknown 3 months ago.

 Additionally it will be vastly less dangerous here. We know what we’re dealing with and have a vastly superior health care system. 

China also has terrible respiratory problems generally because of air pollution and the fact that 50% of Chinese men smoke, many heavily.

* You don’t even have a good supply of testing kits yet.

* Yesterday. Trump promised the Governor of Alabama  that Covid -19 patients would not be sent to the purpose built secure quarantine facility, built for exactly this scenario, that already exists in Alabama.  Further Trump promised he would shift any Alabama  Covid -19 cases to California. 

* You do not have Universal Health Care, and people will infect others while waiting too long to seek care.

* There will be severe cases who will not go to hospital where they should be.

* Information is already being covered up and dumbed down. At 1.30 pm today the Trump Govt response was that there are 22 cases in the USA.  That is a deliberate lie. There are 69.

* Yesterday the official response was that Covid -19 was in 31 countries - a deliberate lie.  It was 61 countries.  It is now 63.

* People are told this is the flu.  Again a lie. It is more highly contagious, and for a longer time, death rate is 2% - 1 in 50. Over 80yrs it’s 15%; over 70yrs it’s 8%. 

* 18% of people are serious or critical. Of those 15% will die.

* If you are a smoker you have a much higher risk of death.

* If you have cardio-vascular disease, diabetes, hypertension (high blood pressure), other lung conditions you are at much higher risk of death."

We're hearing about fatalities, including in the United States, and every loss of life from this virus causes grief, sympathy and determination to prevent more. And we will do all we can. At the same time, know that each individual's chance of contracting the virus is very small. And for those who do develop symptoms, we have evidence that it's similar to seasonal flu. Of course, nobody wants to get sick, even briefly. And people at higher risk - like elderly, frail people and those with impaired immunity - are more likely to need active, professional care if exposed. So we're launching a massive information program aimed at ensuring that every American knows where to turn for help if needed, along with the simple steps that everyone should take to protect themselves and others. And we're calling on applicable federal and state agencies to reach out with information about how to get support when illness gets in the way of taking care of your family. We are blessed with tremendously supportive institutions and the best health care capabilities in the world. 

Knowledge gives us power over this virus and over fear. So, to America's media professionals: Please continue working to provide a complete and balanced understanding.

John Bolton pressured the DHS counterpart, Tom Bossert, to resign along with his team;
the global health section of the CDC was drastically cut and the number of countries it was working in was reduced from 49 to merely 10.
2020: Trump’s budget has $3 billion in cuts to global health funds, including half of the our annual funding to the WHO, and a 10% cut to the CDC’s funding.

Mr. Thongsuk also wore a mask when he drove his cab after having been infected but we do not know if the mask was sufficient enough protection for his passengers.  We can only hope it was.

That bad news is that several other drivers where infected but we do not know if their passengers were wearing masks or not.  If the contagion spread to drivers from infected passengers who where wearing masks, then COVID19 is far more insidious than our simple -- perhaps simplistic -- attempts to wall it off.

More troubling is the Japanese tour bus driver and his guide who became sick, which is bad enough.  However, there were most likely other passengers exposed to infectious agents whom we know nothing about. 

Also problematic is that Mr Thongsuk acted in good faith, believing the Thai government had already been screening passengers entering he country from China.

It wasn't and who knows how many more Thai's have been exposed to the virus.  And if more Thai's become ill, will hospital care be available for them at the same level of proficiency received by Mr. Thongsuk?

If COVID19 breaks out across the US, will our hospitals be as capable as Thailand's?

Not likely b/c beds have been eliminated for the sake of he bottom line."

NYT reported earlier that 5000 Chinese tourists are running free in Bali, unable to return home and not having temperatures taken. There had been at least two recent deaths with symptoms suspiciously similarly to those of COVID 19 and yet the lab tests came back negative. It cannot be attributed solely to blessings from God, as proclaimed by an Indonesian minister."

And of those that do have health insurance, how many have deductibles and co-payments so high that the thought of going to the doctor is enough to discourage them?

How many of these people have paid sick leave that enables them to stay home when they are ill?

And how many have a union that will ensure that they can stay home  when they are ill without risking getting fired, with a further possibility of an eviction or repossession of their car and ending up living on the street?

These are things that civilized societies have for everyone (or nearly so) that protect you from the impact of epidemics: universal health care, universal paid sick leave laws, and union contracts and ""just cause termination laws"" that protect people from unfair firings."

1. Never touch your face, nose, eyes when you’re in public. 
2. Always sanitize your hands when you’ve been in public; say, you’ve been grocery shopping, once in your car, sanitize! 
3.When you get home from work, you’ve been out all day in public, REMOVE your shoes at the door AND wash your hands thoroughly ! Change out of your street clothes. Place them in hamper for laundering.

Everyone is going to have to clear public comments through Trump or Pence - this means the information we receive isn't necessarily going to be truthful based on their track record.  I feel this is what is most troubling about this situation - because the Trump Administration has such a history of lies, many of us simply are skeptical of what they say.  I DO trust the CDC and NIH - but will they be allowed to do their jobs?  Why did the Trump Administration eliminate the entire pandemic section - because Trump didn't want to pay people for ""doing nothing"" - he has concept of planning and preparedness.

The genius of that movie was in leaving us (and many left the theatre before the coda, embedded in the credits, rolled, and that three minutes was the story) with the thought that it was not so much the rise of the apes as the fall of humanity through a pandemic. 

I'm fully aware that this is not that, but it has been very instructive to see the innumerable holes in the so-called firewar to contain this. If nothing else, it has confirmed something I've thought for ages now...we just don't learn, and cannot undo the Darwinian will to survive, one that ironically and paradoxically becomes the mechanism of death in a plague. Those seeking to flee on their own behalf inevitably imperil others. It seems to be hardwired into the pandemic code. 

We need to start working on protocols to keep people calm, to emphasize the efficacy of quarantine (still the number one defense if done properly) and to ensure that there is financial support for the sick and quarantined.

Yet, we still can't manage something as basic and essential as checking incoming passengers --to be clear, ones coming from places with active outbreaks--at airports or giving communities test kits directly. Surreal."

China has been slow to address the food safety and hygiene issues that are part of the problem.  People constantly spit in China and when I was there last year I saw people defecating and urinating in the streets, even in big cities like Shanghai and Beijing.

This did not allow the use of a ventilator, and being the lowly 3rd year medical student, I was given the task of ventilating the patient by hand using the old black rubbery smelly anesthesia bag.  I did it continuously for 6 or more hours.  So in an emergency without ventilators available - I think I still have enough in me to volunteer and do a few more shifts on the bag to help.  No insurance needed.  I’m also more expendable than most of the other health care workers.

Given that bare bones emergency rooms are designed to not even meet normal run-of-the-mill demand to maximize profits, we can imagine hundreds overflowing the meagre medical resources and staff. Americans are too easily confused with the Hollywood Super-America mirage and reality. No, we're going to be completely on our own like every disaster. Remember Katrina, just add Coronavirus.

2020-02-29 20:56,"By choosing not to test any secondary infections, CDC failed to monitor the spreading of COVID-19 in the US. Since half of those infected remain asymptomatic, it is logical to assume that some of those who came into/back to the US from China carried the virus.  They then unknowingly spread the virus to their families, friends and co-workers.  With CDC refusing to test anyone who had not traveled to China (or had been in contact with someone confirmed to be positive), all secondary infections and beyond went unconfirmed. 

The US failure to test and gather data makes us all dependent on the Chinese data. I wouldn't be surprised if Chinese scientists develop the vaccine first.  The US is not only failing to control the disease but it may also be showing to the world how it cannot compete with China."

The masks require special care and training to be fitted properly so that they're effective and most non-professionals don't know how to fit them. But, what it does mean is that health-care providers who come in contact with patients will be unable to obtain them.  This is one example where the bluster and blame from President Trump and his staff while muzzling those experts like Dr. Anthony Fauci, Director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases at the National Institutes of Health, is hurting both the public and the health-care community."

2020-02-29 21:00,"This needs to be said.
I have seen far too many pictures of people wearing protective face masks incorrectly.

1 - A mask must cover both the mouth and the nostrils. When you breath in you are taking in air through your mouth and your nose, The nose is an especially warm, friendly environment for airborne pathogens, who will find the nasal mucosa lining your sinuses perfect breeding grounds and gateway to your body. Covering you mouth and nose also protects others if you are a carrier of the virus.

2 - Most face masks have a metal strip that should be placed across the nose above the nostrils. Make sure you pinch the metal to fit the contour of your nose and cheek, making as good a seal as possible. The metal strip should never be under your chin. The face mask itself, if it is the flat rectangular kind as opposed to the molded kind, should be pulled snugly under the chin.  The metal strip on the molded style of mask should similarly be pinched to fit the shape of your nose. 

3 - Change them frequently.  They are not meant to be worn for extended periods of time.

 It may prove that the simple face masks in general are ineffective means for protection. Until then please use them properly."

The reason why numbers are so high in Italy is because testing has occurred on very high numbers of individuals and potential cases. In a situation where symptoms are difficult to identify and often very mild, many will overlook  them and continue spreading an infection that is deadly for some. 

The US should a page from Italy’s management of the crisis."
2020-02-29 22:10,"There has been a lot of criticism about the CDC not making tests available. The CDC has always followed evidence based protocols in preparing tests for various pathogens. When I see South Korea testing nearly 12,000 at such a short notice and at the same time widespread disease activity, I am beginning to believe something is off. Their tests may be flawed and they maybe releasing people from quarantine with flawed negative tests. I think it is better to get testing correctly rather than depend on flawed testing. This may well be the case in China too. Hopefully the CDC has better test kits available this week. I still think it is not too late. Travel restrictions have given some time. In New York State, the government has been proactive in keeping adequate supplies of PPEs for hospitals and health care facilities in case of need.

Therefore, there is really no way to tell who has the virus unless they are actively ill.
A hairdresser in Australia has been diagnosed with Covid-19, but she had at least 40 clients before she had symptoms.
We don't have the personnel to track everyone nor do we have the tests available.
Why not just tell people to treat it like the flu, do what you would do for the flu and to get to hospital or care center the instant they have trouble breathing to get antiviral medication.
Quarantines and chasing people around may slow it...but these measures will never stop it."
2020-02-29 22:36,"No mention of the US Medical Reserve Corp, which will be responsible for distributing a vaccine if and when it is available?"
2020-02-29 22:37,How many doctors and nurses and so on work for the Veterans Administration and how many beds and ventilators do they have? Is there any chance that there is some percentage of unused resources that could help if the virus spreads widely in our country?
2020-02-29 22:51,"The Surgeon General says to stop buying masks, they don't keep you from getting the coronavirus.  However wouldn't they help stop the spread of the virus if a person had contracted it unknowingly and would then spread it through respiration?

Maybe there is a greater need for the masks, for those who are known to be infected, but just saying, if everyone in the US wore a mask all the time for the next 2 months, it would seem that there would be no risk for transmission between people."
2020-02-29 22:56,This article refers to an 18 year old NYU student who reentered the country from Italy and who was not asked any questions upon re-entry.  She is voluntarily self-quarantining and monitoring her temperature.   I would like to thank her.  She shows more common sense and compassion than the president.
2020-02-29 23:02,"As long as all announcements by federal health officials are filtered through Pence, a science denier who fanned an HIV epidemic in Indiana by refusing to allow a needle exchange (and instead counseled prayer) and who also doesn’t believe smoking causes cancer, the American people should have NO faith in the accuracy of these announcements. We are no better than China where the information comes not from scientists, but from politicians spinning the news for political points. This is a horror show when the tRump administration cares more about an election than public health. As usual, Republicans are either silent or playing down the facts. How low can they go?"
2020-02-29 23:10,"Yes, ventillators are in short supply, and that’s bad.  But even more, just beds in the community are in short supply, and our hospitals are not likely to be able to scale up for a large influx of patients.  Our hospitals are designed to run lean and provide just enough beds for the average needs, otherwise it is financially wasteful.  Empty beds are expensive.  The number of hospital beds since the 1970s has dropped by a third, even while the population has increased by 50%.  And with health care workers being quarantined, soon there will not be enough doctors or nurses to take care of the patients.  And with everyone rushing to the ED with their minor cold symptoms (and coronavirus usually presents as just a cold), especially with the hysteria about this disease, many nurses and physicians are going to be exposed.  Some of those minor colds are going to turn out to be COVID-19."
2020-02-29 23:19,"There are no clear protocols in place for hospitals to follow when presented with a possible coronavirus case. My husband flew from Venice to Boston on Monday 2/24, just as coronavirus cases were rising in northern Italy. On Thursday he started having cold symptoms. On Friday he had deep chest congestion and coughing. His doctor told him they would not see people coming from Italy in their office, and to go to the ER. 
At a hospital ER in southeastern MA, they had no idea what to do with him. ER staff told my husband that they had no protocols for dealing with people coming from Italy. They said he did not meet the criteria for a coronavirus test, even though the media has been reporting that the CDC updated the criteria to include symptomatic persons coming from Italy, South Korea and Iran. The ER personnel knew nothing about this. They tested him for the flu, saying that if he was positive for a known flu, they could rule out coronavirus. The flu test came back negative. A chest x-ray did not show cause for concern. They sent him home without a diagnosis and did not even tell him to self-quarantine! I understand that the chances of his having coronavirus are small. My concern is that medical staff are not trained. This country is NOT prepared for a pandemic."
2020-02-29 23:26,"At the federal level, we must now count on a dwindling number of capable health related public servants and experts still working in the government after Trump’s loyalty purges and agency defunding.  So far, it’s not looking good.

The burden of responding effectively to this emerging pandemic will fall on states, localities - and us.  That’s not looking so good, either.  

Let’s start with getting more test kits."
2020-02-29 23:34,Prepared? This virus appeared more than two months ago in China. As of today there is still a shortage of testing kits in our country. This is one of the reasons we have no idea  who has been exposed and who they have been in contact with. In a nursing home in Washington State where we have had our first fatality 50 people (a combination of staff and patients)  are showing symptoms . We had the chance to prepare but our leaders (I'm looking at you Donnie) were either asleep at the switch or deliberately lying.
2020-02-29 23:57,"The government seems to be emphasizing how the person who died in the US was in poor health, as if that makes it OK that he has died.   If you add up all the high risk individuals, including people over 65 (over 50 million), people with no health insurance, who won't go to the Doctor because they can't afford it ( 30 million), those in poor health (30 million diabetics, 70 million obese people, etc), then there are likely well over 100 million at risk of dying.    So if 30% of those get the virus and 2% who get it die, that would be 600,000 deaths.  The more people that get sick, the less prepared we are."
2020-03-01 0:07,"I find it most informative when top experts are interviewed about the Coronavirus.  Though some seem to be more knowledgeable than others or don’t expound enough on their short answers

What’s most curious to me is the conspicuous absence of Professor Michael T. Osterholm, with the University of Minnesota, on the TV airwaves. Professor Osterholm is widely regarded as being the world’s foremost expert on Infectious disease pandemics. His list of accomplishments, distinctions and experience is second to none.

I would love for him to bring his formidable knowledge to the TV table to add important context to this most critical discussion.

Dr. Osterholm, widely interviewed during the H5N1 Bird Flu scare, is currently the Director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy (CIDRAP) at the University of Minnesota.

NYT and major TV news sources: please seek out his expertise and voice of experience!

Paging Dr. Osterholm..."
2020-03-01 0:09,"I talked to a friend who works at a local Emergency Room yesterday.
He told me they still don't have any PRC test kits they can use immediately, to confirm the Covid-19  virus. 
So they have to take a nasal swab and then wait 2 or 3 days to get results back from the CDC. The CDC has rigid criteria, for whom they can even test. Recently traveled to China, etc.
Meanwhile they have a patient in their ER, who may or may not be infectious. No way to tell. As he said,
""Lock them up in an isolation room, while they wait for results?"""
2020-03-01 0:29,"“The Chinese bought us a month of time to prepare ourselves by imposing these astonishing and draconian measures,” said J. Stephen Morrison, ...“Unfortunately, we didn’t make good use of that time and now we’re heading into a very dangerous situation.”

I have commented on this before. That it was imperative that we use that time to prepare our response. But instead, we squandered that time smugly criticizing China and living in denial.

While the death rate might be about 2%, the real problem is the 20% who get seriously ill. It all depends on how much we can stagger infections. If everyone gets it at once, we are doomed. There are 8 million plus souls in NYC. If even 1% get it at the same time, that is already 80,000 people. That means roughly 16,000 people seriously ill at the same time. Medical services would have been completely overwhelmed long before that. You think they built those emergency hospitals in Wuhan for kicks? And it still wasn't enough. Unlike Wuhan and China, however, this is America. We will not be able to pull off the containment measures that they did. And unlike China, in the US, there will be fire and gunfire."
2020-02-29 21:55,Who says we didn’t make good use of the extra month China afforded us? Trump got a LOT of golf in before he finally had to do his first press conference in a year. So he certainly appreciates it!
2020-02-29 22:28,A Mexican state official says the virus can't survive temperatures above 26°C (78.8° F). Is this true?
2020-02-29 22:45,"People who are coughing or sneezing should be legally required to stay home. 
Everyone should wash their hands before touching their face and after returning home.
People on public transportation should wear scarves or home made face masks that cover their noses and mouths so they don’t cough or sneeze on others."
2020-02-29 23:02,"Should we be concerned about the millions who have no insurance and are not eligible for medicaid because their state said ..dont need it or Trumps policies have kicked them off. So If I am one of these people, generally poor and can not afford a doctor, I will treat my being sick as just kinda flu thing and will continue to go about my business and send kids to school etc.

Well everything should be ok come spring according to the countries leading genius.. Sleep well."
2020-02-29 23:08,"UNprepared 

Why should we prepare when our president says (a) it’s a hoax,(b) it’s not severe, or (c) like a miracle it will disappear very quickly?

The first death has been announced. 

Neither a,b, not c are true. 

At the very least, Americans are being fed lies by our political leaders. At worst, covid-19 will infect a large number of people and even with a small percentage of lethal cases, the death toll could be in the thousands. 

The coronavirus, unlike trump’s republican minions, isn’t afraid of his tweets and pronouncements, won’t hide in the dark. 

But all are infected."
2020-02-29 23:14,"Does it matter how well prepared the medical community is if the populace is being gaslit by Trump's right-wing white-ring that this pandemic is just ""the common cold"" and the ""new hoax,"" and that the only real victim is Trump?

Trump supporters are now a new level of threat as they are being told not to worry about the coronavirus."
2020-02-29 23:38,"How prepared is the corporate media to report this story accurately and help, instead of confuse and panic, the populations of the world? Not very well, in my opinion. The media have created a panic from the reporting of the stock market crashes being caused by the virus. They have fueled fear on a massive scale. Today the Washington Post and NYTimes printed inaccurate identification of the gender of the first American death. NPR did not. NPR did not give a gender ID until it had been confirmed. I am reading the print versions of NPR reports and find them much more informative, and far less provocative."
2020-02-29 22:13,"It is not reassuring to learn that in 2018 the Trump administration fired the government's ENTIRE pandemic response team chain of command, including the White House management infrastructure.  In addition, in 2018 Donald Trump ordered the National Security Council's ENTIRE global health security unit shut down.  It also cut the CDC's global health section's budget by 80%! 

Then I read that in 2017 & 2018 Bill Gates was running around with his hair on fire, repeatedly meeting with National Security Advisors H.R. McMaster & then John Bolton, warning them that ongoing cuts to the global health disease infrastructure would render the US vulnerable to the ""significant probability of a large and lethal modern-day pandemic occurring in our lifetime."" (Gates' exact words).  

That next epidemic is now here, & we'll soon learn the results & costs of the Trump administration's negligence.

2020-02-29 23:21,"The biggest problem our country has is the President and his loyalists can’t be trusted to tell the truth. In order to help his Donald Trump wants people to believe his close to zero number of people in the US have the virus. Pence, Pompeo, Mulvaney want to somehow blame Democrats for inflating the number of people with the virus.

The people of Puerto Rico are still suffering due to Trump’s denial about the number of deaths and damage."
2020-03-01 0:35,I would like to know more about how a history of smoking may affect an individual's response to this disease. China and Korea are nations of heavy smokers as is Iran. Could this be a factor in the virus's spread?
2020-02-29 22:46,"The running comment under the title was ""The country is better positioned than most""  - utter nonsense.  Compared to whom??  We have a highly fragmented health delivery system, a stripped down public health response capability, recently dismantled pandemic response command structure, political gagging of federal doctors and scientists, federal response led by a totally incompetent VP, insufficient hospital beds (thanks to privatizing everything), low domestic drug supplies, drug supply chains that extend overseas -so that we may well run out of important drugs to treat concurrent illnesses, scant stockpiles of PPE for healthcare workers, insufficient numbers of ventilators, woefully insufficient numbers of test kits for the virus.   

And just to accelerate matters and illustrate our incredible incompetence and lack of leadership: according to a senior government employee/whistle blower, unprotected federal workers and base staff were exposed to infected US evacuees brought in from China.  The potentially infected workers and staff left the military base and traveled.   And, in at least one case, on a commercial flight!"
2020-02-29 22:51,"People used to ridicule the Bush, Jr. public health plan as ""don't get sick."" Trump has managed to move down from that level of ineptitude to a propaganda campaign that is insidious and, eventually, deadly: pretending that a deadly new disease is not really moving through the United States. 

For a time, that may comfort some people, but at the expense of unnecessarily increasing their vulnerability, which in turn can accelerate the speed with which COVID-19 will move through the country and overwhelm health care and prevention resources. Apparently the blue states in the west are emerging as ground zero for America's initiation into widespread community transmission of the virus. 

Trump will almost certainly try to spin that into a story about Democrats being responsible for the epidemic to come. That could very well succeed as a means of dividing the country, but it will only worsen the vulnerabilities of those who choose to believe that this disease discriminates on the basis of politics."
2020-02-29 22:58,"I went out today and stocked up on Kleenex, chicken noodle soup, and toilet paper. The stores were jammed, and the virus isn't even here as far as we know.

2020-02-29 23:48,"Reading about the three cases in Washington, Oregon, and California immediately reminded me of what is a likely flight path from the Asian flights refuelings in Alaska then down the coast. Please follow my recommendation of days ago to retrofit all airliners with filtration and germ killing ultraviolet lighting in series with the cabin air exhaust ports that must be present in all planes. I wondered if flights with infected people were streaming traces of the virus during flights that are making their way to the ground.

Plans should be made now to utilize Hotels and Motels while imploring them to civic duty and assured full occupancy financing.

If many lose income, something has to be done for housing finance, be it mortgage insurance legislation to assure a lack of foreclosures, or temporary rental assistance while a resident is sick or out of work with business closures. 

Ventilator manufacturers have to quickly design simplistic gas powered ventilators for tank mounting or pipeline connection, and that means gas suppliers have to ramp up production of gas cylinders, gas supplies, and oxygen generators and compressors."

Who is making these kits?  How could they have followed FDA GMP protocols and released failed product?
Are we now only testing the obviously sick?  Why aren't we testing the families and off-site associates of all the employees at the affected WA nursing facility?  That should have been an immediate priority.  Testing the sick is almost pointless, if we want to contain the spread of infection.
It's clear from today' ""press briefing"" that the WH is more concerned with the stock market, and making the ""president"" ""look good"", than focusing on the health and safety of American citizens."
2020-03-01 0:25,"We are flying blind. Basic epidemiological studies have not been done. We need population-based testing that would identify asymptomatic and very mild infections—especially important because covid-19 is known to be contagious before symptoms manifest. Fecal-oral spread has been identified as another potential route of infection, but no testing is being carried out. Children have been identified as being at low risk for severe disease, but they can be infected and infectious. At the moment, we have no idea where the virus is or how widespread it might be. Stop saying don’t worry, it’s just like the flu: one major difference is that this is a new virus, so by definition no one has any immunity. Please, put public health professionals in charge, and operate with complete transparency: to do otherwise encourages the spate of conspiracy theories and misinformation that are already circulating faster than the virus.I"

Unless you live alone I guess."
2020-02-29 21:55,"How prepared is the U.S. for another viral Trump outbreak? Every opportunity is a self-serving one for this man, and no opportunity is too extreme. His routine is by now nigh predictable. How many of those he appoints to leadership positions are eventually fired? Appointing Pence to head the coronavirus response may have been Trump's kiss of death, for Trump can now blame Pence for anything short of miraculous. And thus replace Pence with Nikki Haley just in time for the election, once again, trumping the Democrats. Deplorable, yes, but plausible?"
2020-02-29 22:04,Testing costs thousands of dollars. The average American can't afford to take a sick day. You can catch it and spread it 30 days before symptoms arise. We're not ready.

Plus we had almost sixty days of head start since the disaster in the making was first uncovered, and yet, we don’t have test kits to detect the virus or enough facilities to isolate the infected. How dare you say say well prepared."
2020-02-29 23:10,"How prepared is the U.S. for a coronavirus outbreak? With this ""leadership"", not at all.

After Trump spoke this afternoon, it is clear that we are now all on our own. Each family, each individual. Under this ""president"" our federal government will do nothing but worsen the problem. Expect our ""president"" to continue to lie to us about this illness. Expect our ""president"" to continue saying it is all a hoax, even though several community acquired cases have already been documented in this country. Expect our ""president"" to have his toadies oversee the containment efforts - all the while ignoring the advice of skilled scientists. Mike Pence as ""Virus Czar""? Positively Kafkaesque. 

And expect that all of the ""president's"" supporters to also believe it is a hoax. This means that some 45% of our citizens will not be taking even the most basic of sensible precautions. Trump has, with his reckless talk, essentially primed tens of millions of his adoring fans as nothing more than disease vectors. If this disease spreads rapidly, they'll be to thank for failing to take the crisis seriously. 

So expect that the truth will not be reported. Expect that medical resources will not be available when they are needed. Expect hospitals to be overrun by the many tens of thousands of folks (or more) without health care coverage, or who cannot afford their deductibles. In short, expect to see this virus play out as it would in any Third World country."
2020-02-29 23:54,How many N95 respirator masks has the government warehoused  in its Strategic National Stockpile so we US citizens can protect ourselves in the event of a local outbreak? Hopefully we can also distribute to countries less fortunate.
2020-02-29 21:57,"We have zero national leadership - merely obvious lies and the muzzling of experts who could help us all know what to do, from employers to health care workers to average citizens.

2020-02-29 22:26,"So....the government can do with us what they will?  What is this law?  I would hope you could tell us exactly where that can be found.

Can the government break into our homes and scurry us away to where ever they want?

That's rather disconcerting."

2020-03-01 0:48,"Well, we need to buy the medical community more time to deal with potential patients. Instead of pondering for any longer, perhaps they should start by closing schools. Yes, terrible for parents across professions etc. It would not stop the spread of the disease, but might slow the spread as families stay home instead of mingling. We are badly underprepared for the vast numbers of older people and immunologically susceptible people falling seriously ill. So yes the public may be inconvenienced, but we need to act with humanity and compassion towards the vulnerable population. So shut the schools in California, Washington and Oregon for a start, from Monday onwards."
2020-03-01 1:00,"Better prepared than the countries with universal health coverage? 27 million Americans have no health insurance, not even through their jobs, and millions more have such a high deductible with their insurance that they avoid going to the doctor or hospital.

We won't be prepared until people can either afford health insurance (not likely) or we have universal healthcare (not likely.) Millions of Americans will be up a creek without a paddle if the epidemic hits here hard."

There are large numbers of people who do not have any health insurance and therefore do not go to doctors unless on their deathbed.

There are even larger numbers of people who do have insurance but who also have high deductible plans who also do not go to a doctor except as a last resort.  

Then there are those who can't afford to miss a day of work at all and because of this are more likely to spread diseases, cases of flu, and other communicable ailments.

We are NOT at all prepared here if this becomes much worse."

I think it's a minute by minute situation right now, and I don't think that anybody really knows what is happening. I suspect that the rules will change in the next 24 hours: there is a facility a few miles from my school with 52 possible cases of coronavirus (two are confirmed, the others have symptoms), and that's new info today. The Seattle mayor has set up emergency operations, the governor of Washington has declared a state of emergency, and hospitals are saying ""if you have symptoms, CALL US but don't come in."" This is all new in the past few hours - who knows what the next few hours will bring! I'm glad it's the weekend so many folks are at home.

I did stock up on basics including plenty of groceries, picked up my one prescription, etc. The stores were busy, and some items (hand sanitizer) were sold out. That's okay with me: if I'm stuck at home it's easy to wash my hands with soap and water, of which I have plenty. As healthy people (no underlying disease), if things are canceled my daughter and I will be bored being stuck at home, but we'll be just fine. I feel sad for those less fortunate.

So - now we wait!"

These two factors alone make it very risky for the US."

If we continue to charge people for quarantine, we will drive the sick underground.  The second issue is if we have to restrict large public gatherings, let us not forget we are in the middle of a primary season, and I wonder whether Bernie Sanders will selflessly agree to suspend his large rallies."
2020-03-01 2:33,"Because so few in the US have been tested ( about 500, as opposed to 10,000 in UK and 60,000 in South Korea) the number of known positive cases in the US is still low. The actual number may be in the thousands or more. The US does not have sufficient kits for testing. It seems like the CDC has fixed the problem of defective coronavirus test kits and a few hundred kits each will arrive in state testing facility by the end of next week. So we may only begin to get an idea of the numbers of people infected in about 2 weeks. Meantime infected people will continue to spread the virus. Difficult to believe how the US of all countries messed this up so bad. Don’t think we have the luxury to wait several weeks to find out. Testing must be ramped up immediately. The country probably needs a few hundred thousand coronavirus test kits. Import them if needed. In the meantime until we know the true extent of the spread of the virus, instead of telling people that the risk is low, and not to worry, they should be told to assume that the epidemic is already here and begin taking common sense precautions."

2020-03-01 2:14,"Florida as a state, with its huge elderly population, seems hardly prepared at all.  Within one block of the hospital in my town is a condo with perhaps 75 people over the age of 60, many already in declining health due to infirmity of age. In this condo, people use the same four elevators, the same laundry facility, mailbox area and perhaps other places of close contact. If half of them were stricken in a month, I doubt there's space for 30 or more acutely ill people in the hospital. This is just one such condo community in one of the smaller towns in a county of more than half a million people.   At least two more assisted living facilities would be served by the hospital.  
These elderly are only one population segment of the people around here who might be infected.  The article mentions 62,000 full-featured ventilators nationwide. That many could be needed in Florida in a week for old people who'd be the first to get the virus and need treatment. 
Plus, those sick with pneumonia will need a lot more care than only ventilators. We'd need help brigades in neighborhoods to shop for the sick if we don't want the walking ill to go out themselves and thus to spread the virus. 
The plain fact is that if the virus gets loose in a place like Florida's retirement communities and neighborhoods, residents will suffer and some will die of  causes we could avoid but won't due to lack of organization and leadership"

2020-03-01 3:10,"Why is the CDC so restrictive on who can be tested? It makes no sense. This means that the asymptomatic and mildly symptomatic are walking around Infecting many more people! 

The strategy should be to test liberally so as to catch as many cases as possible and prevent this from becoming an outbreak. 

Is the government not doing this for political reasons? Due to incompetence? Is there any logical justification for it? Please, someone explain whether there’s any logic to this?"
2020-03-01 3:20,"Technologically we are at a very high level, but not everyone is able to use it meaning able to pay for it..

40% of Americans don't have $500 in savings for emergencies
27 Million Americans have no health insurance
30% of Americans are on high deductible insurance plans
1 in 4 Americans have to refuse medical care because they can’t afford it
35% of Americans get no sick pay
40% of Americans don’t get flu vaccinations

Now imagine just a small portion of these people are forced to see a doctor and get checked for the corona virus? A guy in Florida felt sick after returning from China to Florida. He went to the hospital to get tested. The tab, $3,200 and $1,400 co-pay. You get the picture? This is why the market is crashing. We are a consumer oriented market and a lot of people are realizing right now that they are ill prepared for an emergency.

Politically, Trump and the Republicans are very afraid of the virus as it might expose their failure in healthcare. People in Europe are pretty relaxed as they know all of their expenses are covered. People are also encouraged to stay at home when they have flu like symptoms and a doctor will be send to their home. Can anyone imagine that here? Unless the CDC offers at least free testing for the virus I see a recipe for a possible disaster until vaccinations are available.."
2020-03-01 3:42,"As for testing kits: these are important for tracking the progress of the virus through a community. We've already lost some ground in alerting some areas that the virus Has Arrived and I have no doubt that it's a lot more widespread than is being reported.

However, for us as individuals, once we're sick it's a moot point: if you have a fever and a cough, then ""suit up"" before going to the doctor if you feel really awful, but otherwise self-quarantine. (I'd call in and say I suspect I have it.) Knowing whether its Covid-19 or not doesn't matter, because there's no specific treatment for it."

2020-03-01 6:19,"Excellent article.   We all need to remind ourselves of the arrogance of Nick Mulvaney, Trump's (Acting at) Chief of Staff. Probably not even knowing what a  virus is, he cravenly told the American public to turn off their TVs for 24 hours (to prevent the stock market from tanking further).  If we look back, it is likely we would not have learned important information that is pertinent to decisions we need to be making now to save our, and our families, lives.  We all want to be reassured that ""everything will be ok"",  so when a conman (Trump), and a pastoral counselor (Pence) reassure us, it is wise to be very very skeptical of anything they tell us, unless we have already learned from other sources that the supporting facts are real.   Being a physician,  I suspect Dr Fauci is in a bind only he can navigate -he knows how important he may be to the effort to combat the pandemic, and he knows he needs to not get fired to do that job, and to provide real information to the public.  I will give his words credence, at  the same time knowing he may have to ""shade"" his statements, so that his steady hands, despite beiing slapped, are still  at the wheel. preventing his bosses from making catastrophic mistakes, that literally could cause the deaths of hundreds of thousands,or possibly, millions, of Americans.  Trump should have been touching anyone's hands anyway.  Where is his germophobia when we need it?"
2020-03-01 6:49,"Good article. I would urge U.S. public health agencies to study South Korea's response to coronavirus. I am currently in Seoul and this is what I have observed.
1. The government is totally transparent about the numbers. Briefings are conducted by Korean CDC officials, not politicians, twice daily.
2. Tremendous efforts are made to track the movements of people found to be infected. Government health workers have had direct phone contact with 200,000 members of the secretive religious group that is at the center of Korea's outbreak. They are asked if they have symptoms and they are tested if they do.
3. The government pays for the test if a health official requests it. Those who seek a test on their own pay about $125.
4. Korea is capable of doing 15,000 corona virus tests per day.
5. Drive-thru testing centers have been set up in hot spots.
6. Korea sends emergency alert messages to all phones when new cases arise so that everyone has details about the neighborhood where infections have occurred."

Each individual will decide for himself or herself how best to weather this. Some will make good decisions, and some will not.

Many people will get milder cases and recover without medical treatment.

Others will die because they are frail or because of compromised immunity or because Covid is more lethal than known.

By this time next year we will learn whether coronavirus becomes less impactful ... or continues to be an ongoing threat.

By then we will learn if having Covid provides lasting immunity or if it can be contracted again, much like any flu.

What will start to ebb is the panic as we see this play out firsthand this year and realize that this is another fact of life."

Also in the UK we have the NHS, which is imperfect and is creaking, but is free at the point of delivery. The NHS has a buffer to treat emergencies, called discretionary operations and appointments which can be rescheduled.

It is certain that if coronavirus comes to the US that it will overwhelm our current medical facilities. Having an unfit person in charge is already proving to be disastrous. There is chaos and uncertainty regarding how to proceed. Trump, as usual, only cares about the stock market OR how the fallouts from this disease will affect him in the polls. 

It is very sad that rural hospitals are often underfunded and that rural people are neglected  in many ways. How sad that the middle class and the poor are also neglected. It is the wealthy who get everything...the best medical care and the best hospitals and can afford the wealthiest, highest paid doctors.

We owe China a huge debt for “going medieval” on the coronavirus, and being willing to lose so much monetary capital in order to save lives. They bought the rest of the world time by falling on their own sword.

And, in comparison to the Western attitude we’re seeing (Trump’s stock market tunnel vision, and Italian business ceo’s already complaining, basically saying we can all handle the deaths, but they don’t want to lose money), one can begin to wonder who values lives over profits? I always assumed the Western world obviously valued lives more than the Chinese Communist Party full of kleptocrats....

But, now...wow...the Chinese have really thrown me for a loop. Their response to the virus was initially not perfect, but I fear that they will have done much, much better than our Western capitalist greed power players will be willing to do.

In the last few decades, China has now unleashed on the world three viruses costing thousands their lives. H1N1 first, SARS the next and now, Wuhan.

And no one will disagree that China is a totalitarian and all government country.

Yet, despite their versions of universal health care – the Chinese continue to lose lives despite creating or at least giving rise to these viruses.

I think in the next Democrat debate – if we have a real good questioner – might want to ask Bernie how he thinks his Medicare for All – will be better positioned for a viral epidemic.

2020-03-01 11:24,"Imagine yourself suffocating as your lungs fill with fluids from a reaction to a virus, or as you suffer a systemic reaction to the Covid 19 virus. Relief could be as simple as a ventilator, or drugs to counter the immune system's over-reaction to the invading virus. Then imagine the scenario in which a simple respirator is denied to you as you lay dying, because the hospital had no budget to stock up for epidemics. Far fetched? For-profit hospitals and even most not for profit medical systems have strong disincentives to incur costs for unlikely events. Their mandates are profit maximization, or cash generation targets. Their executives' bonusses depend on reaching respective targets, not on filling closets with respirators that might go unused for decades, and not in building capacity that might be used only in the event of a disaster. For 'free market' purists out there, perhaps now is the time to consider that government does have a legitimate role in the fantasy world conjured up by America's reality television version of a social contract."
2020-03-01 5:44,"This may be a test that will expose America's current social contract. 

Many big firms have stayed mum while Republicans, veering further and further right, undermined national resilience. Cutting health care budgets at the state and national level leave many populations vulnerable. Suddenly companies realize that medical infrastructure matters, not just for executives. Microbes spread.

Corporate America happily led the charge against unions, leaving the dirty work to well-lobbied DC politicians. Now workers face immense challenges if job sites close down for weeks or months. It's not just low pay, but contracts that don't provide support in emergencies.

The wealthy regularly complain of paying 50% or, gasp, 55% of their income in taxes, local, state, federal. Along with inheritance, they pass along the message that government wastes their money. Fox News won't go down so well when your neighbors, family, and yourself get sick.

Those who say media and others hype this for political purpose are way behind the curve. Everything gets politicized in this culture. This won't help Biden or Pelosi. Americans fed a diet of right-wing pablum, or left-wing animus, will turn angry. Sanders is the most likely beneficiary.

A Sanders Presidency is a risky proposition, not as dangerous as Trump's, but not one for the thoughtful. If the US social contract is ripped, and CV19 reveals it, it's their own fault if corporate America gets the President they fear."

One that I haven’t seen addressed is that since most people live paycheck to paycheck without sick leave, they won’t make rent.  How can we deal with evictions without a fund to cover these kinds of expenses?  Luckily, our department had such a fund which was essential to better assure compliance.  As the article points out, while public health can have the authority to mandate quarantine and isolation, it doesn’t have the resources to do it with one case let alone an outbreak.  Let me say,  carrots are ALWAYS cheaper and more effective than sticks for compliance."

US Population about 330 million
Based on no immunity and no vaccine
and about 2.3 infection rate per person infected
and transmission without symptoms
John Hopkins estimates 40 to 60% will get the virus
within the next year  
Experts think the virus will be less contagious this summer. 
Using the midpoint 50% then 165 million will get the virus
China data says 20% of those with the virus need hospital care
So 33 million will need hospital care
If the 2% mortality rate is close then 3.3 million will die
If 1% then 1.65 million will die. 
Based on China data death rate by age is 
>80 is 16% of those with the virus
>70 to 79 is 8% of those with the virus
>60 to 69 is 4% of those with the virus
In the US approximately 2.5 to 3.0 mm deaths a year
In the US approximately 37 to 40 hospitalizations per year
The system is staffed and equipped for these rates. 
Hopefully the spring and summer will provide a window to prepare
a therapeutic and available vaccine for the 60 and older population that will be needed in the northern hemisphere by October. No way is it appropriate to go thru normal procedures and timeline to develop therapeutics and a vaccine. The southern hemisphere needs therapeutics and a vaccine now."

People should be more self disciplined by avoiding mass gathering and close contact in public areas, wash hands often, and work from home if necessary.

I hope our government officials are up to this task since Chinese government took tremendous and draconian measures, and has bought us about a month of time to prepare.

Keep yourself well. Hand washing is #1. Keep your hands away from your face! Avoid crowded places. This a situation of statistics in real life. Best practices will save THOUSANDS of lives. 
Behavior modification is not really that hard, and it can mitigate the severity of the pandemic. Less sick people infect less well people and stress facilities less, so sick people can be treated.

2020-03-01 10:53,"I saw the interview with Trump, Pence and a few health officials behind. He started by eulogising those killed in Afghanistan as though any new deaths from the virus would be a minor sacrifice compared to the brave people who kept returning for further tours of duty. It felt like he was implying the inevitable coming hardships will be negligible compared to those of the service people. He was using them again for political purposes. But I could not help recall how he dodged national service during Vietnam. It was a sickening exhibition of manipulative dishonesty. Then he went on to the coronavirus; bragging about what an amazing job he has done when only hours before it was a Democrat hoax!
He has not done a good job. It was the height of incompetence
* Bringing in infected Americans back with those of uncertain infective status on the same aircraft
* Sending people to pick them up unprotected without proper clothing and training
* Dismantling the needed agencies before the event so that the repatriation and pick up was a hopeless shambles
* This list could be very long but I will just cite the extreme lack of testing equipment and the difficulty in getting testing organised when other countries have conducted thousands of tests.
It's a wonder he doesn't purge medical staff of any never trumpers or others who don't pay tribute to the very stable genius. What a shameless exercise in fakery."

And in a different Times piece today with the photo where a healthcare worker is transferring an actual patient w/ Coronavirus in Kirkland, WA, shocking to see NO gown, gloves, or N95 mask!  It is apparent to me now why so many healthcare workers treating Coronavirus are also falling ill and why the virus is further spread."

2020-03-01 17:06,"Just from what I am seeing play out there is a serious lack of testing happening in our country already. Meanwhile this highly contagious virus is spreading which is why we are hearing of cases where people did not travel at all. As for masks, I really don't blame people for trying to protect themselves. I just upgraded my respirator that I already have with new filters. In the past, I have used correctly sized N95's disposables for air travel in the winter and as an added measure bactracin ointment over each nostril. I also kept my hands sanitized and rinsed my nostrils with salt water after I am home. I have never become ill, even with visibly sick people near me on the plane. By comparison, I got infected by a flu strain not in the shot I had that year, by standing behind a woman with a sick toddler at the feed store when the kid coughed.  After that experience, I am convinced that masks can and do work when used properly."

You were warned about emergent viruses for at least the last twenty years. There were whole MOVIES on this stuff that told you how hard it’d be to stop once ot got going. You were told about shortages in research funding. You were told about why we needed everybody to have access to health care. You were told about our shortages of new researchers. You were even told, again and again, about global supply chains and why we need strong alliances and international cooperation. 

And you were most def told about the basics of home self-defense—the real ones, not those involving assault weapons and hundred-round magazines. Oh, and the need to learn some science basics.

You
Were
Told. 

So after a couple decades of warnings and entreaties for help during which you found better stuff to do (like watch “The Apprentice,” and elect a grinning fool who can’t be trusted, and you were warned about THAT, too), now you’re running around yelling and buying up all the Purell.

Obama), slashing funding for CDC and WHO  (pandemics are a perfect example of why the US cannot cut itself off from the rest of the world).  And creating an anti-science environment that resulted, in part, in 1,600 scientists leaving the federal govt.  And, of course, appointing Mike Pence as the person through whom all communication must first pass.   Really?  Does anyone doubt why he was chosen?   Do we really think he'll share info from Anthony Fauci and other experts that might help the US deal with this situation, but possibly taint his Great Leader?

Even worse, doctors and hospitals send patients to collection agencies, sue them, and garnish their wages if they fall behind on bills, as if sick patients had any choice in needing healthcare. In Kansas it's so bad they throw people into prison if they don't show up to court hearings after getting sued for medical debt.

Because of our punitive medical debt collection industry, and because people are already facing thousands of dollars of debt just to get tested and treated for COVID 19, we are a third world country at the absolute bottom in terms of being able to stop this epidemic.

I could not think of a person less qualified than Pence to be “in charge” of the CDC’s handling of the corona virus in the US except Trump himself or maybe Rush Limbaugh who also publicly claimed tobacco didn’t cause cancer only to find himself presently dying due to lung cancer.

US just reported at least 3 cases with no known contact history along with one death. I believe the more realistic mortality rate is from South Korea 0.48%. The outbreak in SK is related to the Shincheongji Church of Jesus. The health official carried out an aggressive case tracing with initial double digits of covid-19 infections reported to 3,526 in less than 2 weeks.

With the current chains of command in the White House, they cannot even announce the gender of first deceased person correctly.

With the current epidemic started 6 weeks ago in China, it provides the rest of the world borrow time for preparation. Remember mortality rate of 1% with one death means 100 person or more infected persons are not identified ( The infection ratio is 1 to 2.2 published in NEJM). Time is essence."

Currently, experts believe that the virus manifests differently in different people - many had it and didn't know they had it.  It is prudent to behave just as we do at the heart of flu season; still going on.  

And there were no cuts to the CDC, which has billions at their disposal.  The Ebola division had millions each years since 2002.   Cutting that budget would not have been a bad thing; that money needs to go to other groups as we don't have an Ebola issue.  Also, billions going to other countries may be worth questioning - are we sending money for research, supplying technology or personnel, or providing ???  It isn't wrong to question.  

This virus will likely spread, but whether it's a crisis depends on attitude and effort.

This is why China had to build popup hospitals, ship military medical personnel in to help and create huge supply chains of equipment. This country is doomed... and trump had three weeks to be thinking and planning...but NO all that mattered was his golfing, and his reelection, and the stock market.

2020-03-01 3:36,"FOX news (essentially trump’s propaganda agency) is fully engaged in a concerted cover up effort to deliberately camouflage just how badly managed the COVID-19 response has been in the US. The trump administration over the last two years has been drastially cutting budgets and gutting public health agencies, eliminating preparedness teams, and abruptly  dismissing expertise. It’s clearly a deliberate effort to dismantle the important measures Obama made to effectively protect the nation from the 2014 Ebola infection crisis. And as with all things Obama, trump is doing these things vengefully, recklessly and surreptitiously. The nation is already paying a huge price with the looming emergence of a similar infection crisis, the COVID-19 outbreak and undoubtedly there is more to come."

Children were left orphaned and families were devastated. As many American soldiers were killed by the 1918 flu as were killed during World War I. No area of the globe was safe; eskimos living in remote outposts in the frozen tundra were sickened and killed by the flu in such numbers that entire villages were wiped out.  Scientists have found shards of the flu virus frozen in Alaska and preserved in scraps of tissue in a government warehouse.  One in four Americans were afflicted.  The virus itself began as a fairly mild illness in the spring, and then diminished. It came raging back in the fall, but so deadly people became ill and within a few days died. One of the reasons it became so deadly the second time around was due to news blackouts at the time as to its lethal nature. This is not meant to instill panic, but it is important that our experts and the govt make this a priority in its early stages and keep us informed."

Despite that, Seattle has failed to shut  down one of the largest garden shows in USA.  The Northwest Flower & Garden Show is a large annual exhibition of horticulture and gardening held in Seattle, Washington, for five days each February.
...
It was in full swing this weekend, with expected attendance in one single building, on one single floor,  of 60,000-65,000 people.

Many people ( like my Seattle sister who says “ I am not about to alter how I live my life”) rode the rail link system that goes from just south of Sea-Tac Airport to north of downtown.

In another week or two, one of the largest USA sewing, fabric  design and quilting shows runs for 3 days in a community near Sea-Tac airport.  It, too, will draw many thousands of people.

Why are these not being cancelled this year?"
2020-03-02 0:38,"You fearful of a pandemic? A friend sent this to me today. From a pathologist and molecular virologist. 
 
Date: February 26, 2020 at 2:35:50 PM EST 

Subject: What I am doing for the upcoming COVID-19 (coronavirus) pandemic 


Dear Colleagues, as some of you may recall, when I was a professor of pathology at the University of California San Diego, I was one of the first molecular virologists in the world to work on coronaviruses (the 1970s). I was the first to demonstrate the number of genes the virus contained. Since then, I have kept up with the coronavirus field and its multiple clinical transfers into the human population (e.g., SARS, MERS), from different animal sources. 

The current projections for its expansion in the US are only probable, due to continued insufficient worldwide data, but it is most likely to be widespread in the US by mid to late March and April. 

Here is what I have done and the precautions that I take and will take. These are the same precautions I currently use during our influenza seasons, except for the mask and gloves.: 

End of Part 1 (it’s long)"
2020-03-02 0:07,Do you know all the truth about COVID-19 in U.S.?
2020-03-02 0:38,No one is thinking about the safety of our elections. This virus may slow in the summer but will be back with a vengeance come November. There needs to be a push for mail in paper ballots nationwide now!
2020-03-02 2:22,"In the U.S., we're not testing for Covid-19 enough to have any idea of what's going on. But what else should we expect from an imperial power whose health care system is GoFundMe?"
2020-02-28 18:08,"Pence is not in charge of anything. He's simply acting as gatekeeper to make sure the press and the American Public, don't get any realistic and useful information about the disease until it's too late. His only concern is the stock market. We will get nothing but upbeat -- and false -- info until local health officials start ignoring anything that comes out of his office. By then the U.S. infections will be in the tens of thousands."
2020-02-28 18:32,"Thank you for this factual review of VP Pence’s record in Indiana.  As someone who lived there during the period covered, I can attest to its accuracy.

Mike Pence is an evangelical Christian, as you point out.  But as his response to HIV patients in Indiana makes clear, that is not to be confused with the gospel of Jesus Christ attested by Scripture and embraced by the global, mainstream church.

Indeed, in its attitude to science, health, and human suffering, as to so much else, evangelicalism is showing itself in the Trump era to be a sect, a massive failure to grasp the most basic truths of Christian faith."
2020-02-28 18:46,How different is Pence’s role in the coronavirus outbreak response effort from that of Communist Party minders in countless activities in the Soviet Union.  Pence’s presence can have nothing other than a political purpose. We can expect him to be an impediment to those who are simply trying to do the best job possible with limited resources.
2020-02-28 18:53,"I suspect Trump is putting him in charge so he can distance himself from the outbreak, being too closely associated with it (and the toll it takes on the stock market) won't be good for his re-election."
2020-02-28 18:59,"Pence is there to control the message - saving people, healthcare and lives are all secondary."
2020-02-28 19:33,"Until we get our national briefings from recognized and trusted medical experts look for massive and growing distrust by the general population. This is a health crisis, this is real life, and distrust will eventually seep into even the most fervent believers who cannot deal with the painful cognitive dissonance created by what they are told versus what they know to be true."
2020-02-28 19:48,"Trump is putting distance between himself and Coronavirus. And Pence. Should the veep’s efforts fail, that new dress Nikki Haley just bought will be on full display just in time for the general election."
2020-02-28 18:17,"Perhaps a most critical time in our recent history and Trump appoints an anti-science, happy face all the time boot licker to 'head up' our response to this grave threat.

He'll ignore all the sound advice scientists and public health experts give him until it's super clear that their advice is right. 

I guess it could have been worse:  if Trump had decided to head it up.  But that's about all you can say here."
2020-02-28 19:34,"Not surprising at all ; no one in Trump's cabinet are qualified for their positions and those that are are his yes men . To treat this outbreak as more of the same is criminal ; more so since all the medical professionals that are qualified have to consult Pence before any decision is made . Their ineptness , and politicization of a serious  situation about to become a pandemic is on the verge of becoming a deadly choice for many Americans . This is still America , not China where Xi and the politburo control and hide information ."
2020-02-28 19:34,"Pence has been working hard to roll back women's sexual reproductive health rights, especially through UN forums -- so globally. Right now, a US team from DC is building allies among UN diplomats in NY to push ""pro-family"" agenda against LGBTQ rights at the annual women's rights conference in March."
2020-02-28 19:34,"How lucky are we to have someone who said “smoking doesn’t kill” leading the effort to protect us against the coronavirus? If you want to really get scared, check out the profile of Pence in the Jan/Feb 2018 edition of The Atlantic."
2020-02-28 19:50,"Complicit!

the president and his minions endanger all Americans with uninformed decisions made to protect trump rather than improve national security and our safety. 

Where’s the pandemic task force? Oh yeah. Fired. 

trump is great at firing people and installing unfit friends and family members into positions that require experts with experience and logic."
2020-02-28 19:59,"I have just reviewed the proposed Guidance document by the Council for Environmental Quality for federal agencies in their role of assessing environmental impact. Naming Pence as the coronavirus czar is consistent with the strangling of real science and distancing of scientists and engineers from the decision-making that the CEQ has written into the Guidance document. The Trump administration attacks environmental and public health science on all fronts. 

Example: the Guidance document's definition of ""reasonably foreseeable"" means foreseeable by ""an ordinary person of prudence"". This is very different from what is reasonably foreseeable by a trained and experienced environmental scientist or engineer. Important environmental decisions are allotted to ""an ordinary person of prudence"" in the Guidance document. Ignorant, incompetent people would be making the decisions about air and water quality, ecosystems, disruption of human communities, and long-term environmental damage.

The Trump administration is taking us back to the Dark Ages. Now we have a potential public health being addressed by someone who isn't even ""an ordinary person of prudence."" He is an ideologue with an anti-science agenda coupled with a real dislike of most of us."
2020-02-28 20:00,"The one salient defined aspect of Pence's job as corona-virus czar is that ALL government communication and announcements regarding the progress of the pandemic (soon to be epidemic) must be cleared through him.
So, the VP will not be working o anything concrete in terms of limiting the spread of the disease and the prevention of deaths, he will be tasked with being the head PR guru.
Because that's what is really needed now, tightly controlled partisan messaging.  The virus will thus collapse in disarray."
2020-02-28 20:03,Notice how Jared (and Ivanka) have stayed out of this time-bomb.  Trump is cagey enough to see the potential issue with controlling this virus and he chose a good scapegoat to throw  under the bus when and if it hits the fan!
2020-02-28 20:05,"Historians say that the 1918 flu was made worse by President Woodrow Wilson’s efforts to pretend everything was just fine.

Looks like we are repeating the same playbook with President Trump."
2020-02-28 20:09,If the Vice-President does a good job dealing with this he has an excellent chance of being elected President in 2024 after Trump finishes his second term.  He needs a few resume builders which Trump can help him acquire.  Waste no time.
2020-02-28 19:51,"What Has Mike Pence Done? He has let Trump speak for him, over him, around him, and under cut him. He has sat quietly and let this happen. He has let Trump speak words, thoughts, and tweets that Pence would never allow among his faith friends. 
Pence was appointed to handle coronavirus so that Trump could do whatever he wanted. Any other official, with integrity, would not allow Trump to make the decisions about our health and safety. Our president does not care about our health and safety."
2020-02-28 19:19,How accurate are the numbers coming from China? Won’t this be the same here in the U.S. since he appointed the VP who can do a cover-up as well? There is no transparency when he appoints someone with zero expertise.
2020-02-28 20:35,"It seems that unlike Senate Majority leader Mitch---whom I despise---GOP leaders are more reasonable than what Democrats think. If only legislators can work together instead of casting spells and insults at each other, care something other than merely ""winning"" and ""losing"", healthcare reform is more bipartisan than likes such as Trump believe."
2020-02-28 21:16,"The coronavirus does not just target the poor, immigrant, female, LGBTQ or middle-class. If it did, with Mike Pence in charge, those groups might be in big trouble. But Mr. Pence, and much of the male, middle-aged and older Senate, may be particularly vulnerable to the deadly effects of this coronavirus. So you can bet they'll get something done, I only hope their expert instinct for self-preservation will benefit all of us."
2020-02-28 22:52,We have a crisis that requires a science-based approach and it's been handed off to a person who has to pray to a mythical sky being before he decides to take action.  Am I the only one who doesn't feel safer with Pence at the helm on this issue?
2020-02-28 23:07,"Mike ""wax-museum"" Pence is probably not one of the more enlightened choices to head the nation's coronovirus response. We can count on him to mute the message as Trump's mouthpiece, and his anti-science stance is in direct contradiction to the science-based approach to deal with a global epidemic. I have little faith that he can really do anything effective or impressive--a leader he is not.  I hope I'm wrong."
2020-02-28 23:21,"“Through the Health Indiana Plan model of Medicaid expansion, we learned firsthand the immense value of health insurance as a tool for responding to public health crises,”....we need health care to prove health care works? really?   so we need education to prove education works!  we need stop signs to prove stop signs work!  I could go on but...."
2020-02-29 0:07,"Hopefully he continues to delegate and defer to experts in the CDC and elsewhere like he did in Indiana. 

Otherwise we better all join him in saying some prayers.

“At the time, the C.D.C. praised the hospital where the patient had shown up in the emergency room for its infection control, including its rapid isolation of about 50 hospital workers who were exposed to the patient. Mr. Pence’s role was largely receiving updates from the state health department.”"
2020-02-28 17:49,"Pence was appointed to be point man on coronavirus on Wednesday night.

What did Pence do yesterday? .......assemble a team of top doctors? ....meet with world health leaders?

No. He ventured off to the CPAC convention to hang out and give a highly partisan speech praising the leadership of his boss.   Then he went on Hannity last night. Today he's heading to Florida for a fundraiser."
2020-02-28 18:04,"Trump eventually throws all who work for/with him under the Bus. Just look at the road in the wake behind him littered with dead political sacrifices who either were forced to resign, fired, or worse. The only people who have seemed to dodge this fate since the beginning are Mike Pence and Kelly Ann Conway.  Well now it’s Mike Pence’s turn. Trump is setting him up to be the fall guy in the event this Corona Virus thing goes sideways in the US. Pence probably thinks he’s smarter than Trump and can out-maneuver Trump on this issue, but to me the handwriting is on the wall, and Pence better start preparing for serious blowback."
2020-02-28 18:06,"Listen up, me pretties!
The Adorer of the MAGA  should be able, if nothing else, to assume the prayer leadership of the planet 's anti-science stance. And, there seems to be a reciprocal relationship between the coronavirus pandemic intensity and the veep's continued lid-drop proclivities whenever he's in the presence of the Adored leader of the infected world.  
MAGA, Make America Germed Again."
2020-02-28 18:52,"I thought Trump appointed Pence so that if anything went wrong with this virus, he could blame Pence."
2020-02-28 19:46,Trump pumping up somebody else's resume for a change.  Pence is a lap dog.  He was a failed governor who was going nowhere when Trump was shopping for a lap dog.  I wouldn't hire Pence to do anything of critical importance.
2020-02-28 20:52,what is most likely to happen is that Pence will drag his feet on lifesaving measures and then the Democrats will be blamed
2020-02-28 21:23,"another trump boot licker, way out of his  element. i've stopped saying, ""can it get worse."""
2020-02-28 21:43,Pence is the sap that  will be holding the bag Trump gave him.
2020-02-28 22:17,"No worries.
Pence will start community prayer meetings to pray the Coronavirus away.
Just think of the power of the prayers, all those people gathered together in one place, holding hands and praying.
What could possibly go wrong?"
2020-02-28 22:59,"I did notice that the photo halfway down the story had 'HIP' and Mr Pence in the same frame, this was an unfortunate negative reality inversion where the quantum realm placed these two conflicting things in the same place at the same time, luckily on the planet Thawg in an outer ring of the Sombrero Galaxy (also known as Messier Object 104) Rooodnot the mighty had just managed to trip and fall backwards onto a long dead veegee mouse bottom first, thereby eating his breakfast in reverse.  As both events were utterly absurd and equally unlikely they managed to cancel one another out thus saving the entire universe from collapsing in on itself in an absurdity implosion event.  I am sure i am not the only one to notice this improbable image and ask the NYT to be a little more careful when using such dangerous photographs in the future as one cannot be sure that there may be residual improbability matter attached to such an image which may induce illness, mild dry retching or a rash."
2020-02-29 2:21,Pence is to healthcare as Jared is to international diplomacy
2020-02-28 18:22,He's just a placeholder for a ghost.
2020-02-28 18:37,"Three thoughts:

1. I would *love* for Pence and his extended family to live below the poverty line for a year, in an isolated and undisclosed location such that no one could slip them little luxuries. Maybe that would give him a new perspective on what poverty does to a person, and why it's inhumane to ask the poor to scramble to find some way to pay a premium for something that's a basic right in every developed nation in the world (and some undeveloped).

2. I would love for Pence to have to fill out, with zero help, all of the burdensome forms that are required if one is to receive benefits.

3. Funny how these ultra-religious science-deniers never stop to think that maybe -- just *maybe* -- God has given some people the intellect to solve our most pressing problems, and therefore we should listen to them. I mean, no one every prayed a highway into existence.

Please vote these sociopaths out of office. If you're a so-called moderate who's on the fence about any of the Dem nominees, remember that Congress is centrist -- there's no way that any progressive will pass more than a fraction of his/her agenda. But if you abstain or vote red, this nation will not survive, period. Democracy won't survive; the climate crisis will engulf us; and the next pandemic will kill you or someone you dearly love. 

So vote blue, in every race."
2020-02-28 19:18,Maybe Pence was selected because cardboard cutouts are immune to any known virus.
2020-02-28 22:13,"The best place to get accurate and timely info on this may be a blue state health department web site. They all have epidemiologists and public health experts on staff, and will be able to speak truthfully, since they do not need to have their statements approved by the VP’s office in the Ministry of Truth (see: “1984”)."
2020-02-28 18:10,I believe Trump is doing this so that he can throw Pence under the bus when the outbreak arrives in the US in a bigger way.
2020-02-28 19:31,"The internal conversation going in in Mike Pence's head must be mind-blowing. How he justifies to himself his support of - or even association with - a mendacious and adulterous man who has stiffed any businesses he can bully  into giving up on what he owes them is mind boggling. 
Will he ever explain this? I hope so - inquiring minds want to know!"
2020-02-28 19:40,It's highly likely that VP Pence believes the corona virus is God's will..
2020-02-28 20:43,The question should be what Mike Pence has done TO health.
2020-02-28 21:10,Pence has done nothing. Period. Except look adoringly at Trump much as Nancy did with Reagan. Me thinks Trump is planning to throw him under the bus to make room for Nikki Haley as his running mate.
2020-02-28 21:55,"Putting the politics of the health insurance industry aside (which is another woeful conversation), the weaponization of public health outcomes by the Republican Party in recent decades should be considered criminal negligence by the American public during our next election. Scott County, Indiana is just 35 miles up I-65 from the city I live in, and Pence's response to the HIV outbreak there was frightening, especially since his religious-based stupidity could easily affect where I live, despite not voting for him."
2020-02-28 22:02,"As the socialist echo chamber that is the comment section of the NYT continues to giggle and ridicule Pence for being a believer in God, the fact remains that under his leadership, the State of Indiana implemented the Health Indiana Plan that is now the model for how The Federal Government is reforming Medicare and Medicaid.  In fact, Sean Verma, the Administrator of CMS had the same role for the State  of Indiana before being brought to Washington by Trump. The basic tenant of Medicaid enrollees having  financial skin in the game started in Indiana and has moved to the Federal level via Pence and Verma. This tenant is 100 percent in keeping with how Republicans view how Medicaid should be structured."
2020-02-28 23:12,"In February, 2016, Trump gushed, 'I love the poorly educated'.  He and Republicans sure do love the ""poorly educated"" so so much that they have appointed them to head governmental departments they know nothing about.  Which brings us to Mike Pence, Indiana's very own ""Plastic Jesus"" or Mike, the Shun-ner; ( of compassion, of knowledge, of science, of the needy, of all of God's children (Mike has a short-list and so on)

Thank you, NY Times, for not shunning his record and the facts."
2020-02-28 23:13,"Mike Pence will probably recommend prayer and holy water as they did during the Black Plaque.   His enmity to science that does not match his religious beliefs and politics is a bad omen.
Denial is the pattern for dictators as we have seen in China and Iran, and are already seeing here with all those triumphant claims so early in the game being made by Trump."
2020-02-28 23:38,Like President Meyer selecting VP James to head a banking task-force.
2020-02-29 0:02,I'm ill just thinking about Pence.
2020-02-28 20:19,"One major problem with appointing Pence to lead the response is that he has as little credibility in telling the truth as Trump does. 

Most people (and the markets) won’t believe a word he says or even the words of others who may speak on the administrations behalf. 

Trump and the republicans have dug this hole themselves and can’t blame the media or liberals for this crisis. 

And his base, who have either supported or tolerated the administration’s lies, now have a new issue to contend with, one when the lies are a matter of life and death."
2020-02-28 20:19,"The single point of contact for the latest on the Coronavirus should not be a politician but a trustworthy individual with a medical/scientific background who is knowledgeable about contagious diseases.  Mike Pence, a politician and Trump sycophant, does not meet that criteria.  He was chosen so that the White House can maintain control of the message by filtering news of developments through a political strainer to make Donald Trump look good.  That is because Trump is more interested in what happens to the stock market than the spread of the pandemic.  If he were genuinely concerned about the potential disastrous consequences of the Coronavirus for Americans, he would have put a credible, non-partisan medical expert in charge instead of Pence.  Some things should rise above politics and the pandemic is one of them.  Otherwise, nothing is sacred.  The sociopath, Trump, knows no shame."
2020-02-28 22:42,"If it doesn’t go well, he can be the fall guy and trump can pick a new running mate."
2020-02-28 23:06,"It’s a shocking choice.  Pence is not a science guy.  He’s against teaching evolution, and he probably believes the earth is only 10,000 years old.  Fighting a virus requires more than thoughts and prayers.  It requires an understanding of virology, medicine, public health and epidemiology.  Pence has none of those things.  In fact, he’s probably against all of those things.  What’s next, flat earth people running NASA?"
2020-02-28 23:32,"There is nothing worse than misinformation and lies in a situation of public emergency. This administration has been dishonest, day after day, for more than three years. Now Pence wants us to believe him? No, thanks.
November 2020 is closer than ever."
2020-02-28 22:51,"On the story pages and in the comments right here in the NY Times, I have seen Pence described as a ""botched taxidermy experiment"" and a ""wax museum figure"".  

On the positive side, from what I can tell, I have seen nothing that would argue against those characterizations.  

On the negative side, from what I know about him, those two descriptions are too generous.  He apparently has no important knowledge or skills to bring to an effort to marshal a medical fight against a pandemic.  Every time I have seen him, he looks like a store mannequin.  His main purpose in life seems to be sucking air, absorbing taxpayer dollars, and nodding 'yes' whenever Trump tells him to.  Pence appears to be just waiting for Trump's high blood pressure, obesity, liver disease and/or the father of one of Trump's Lolita Express ""playmate's"" to catch up to him.

 What could Pence possibly bring to a pandemic-fighting party ?"
2020-02-28 20:55,"No buck stopping with Trump unless that buck is going right into his pocket. Nope. True to form, he won’t own this big bomb but toss it right over to his dim lackey Pence. Pence deserves this shove under the bus. He knew in his holier than thou heart the big Corona was coming in one form or another. Control the messaging??!! What does that mean? You mean the spin? Ugh. They should just change the “messaging” of the Emergency Broadcast System now. “This is an actual emergency and we got nothing for you. You are on your own folks. There are no instructions about what to do. There is no where to go.” Remember Katrina? We knew that storm was coming. Pence is Trump’s Brownie."
2020-02-28 21:24,"Mr. Pence, as Indiana's 'Ayatollah_Governor', tried to pray HIV, (due to needle sharing), away, with disastrous results!
While the precise number of avoidable HIV-Infections thus occurring has been the subject of speculation...it has been reliably, reported that there were 'several hundred' HIV-transmissions, which, otherwise, WOULDN'T have occurred...had a scientifically sensible course of action, (a '1-for-1' needle exchange), been undertaken!

That Trump...
Obviously, worried, about the stock market's reelection effects, (Vs. morbidity / mortality issues in people, infected),   appointed this Xian_Jihadist, (Pence), to mismanage the C-9-virus situation IS tragic / is NOT surprising...

This appointment is a pathetic and typical public relations, propagandistic effort by Mr. Trump and his minions to pretend that they are doing something intelligent and constructive, while Mr. Trump continues to spend most of his time golfing, tweeting nonsense, becoming more obese on cheeseburgers, spray-painting his face orange and arranging his comb-over hair with spray-on glue. Mind-boggling in every negative sense, but typical Trumpianism with Mr. Pence happily going along with the gross incompetence and venality of everything Trump."

How awful is it that pence, who knows nothing about science or medicine, is ""appointed "" to oversee this nations virus response.  
Pay no attention to this  buffoon. He has a proven track record of disease promotion in Indiana, as this article states.  Probably because he though he could get rid of a few homosexuals and IV drug users.  Pathetic ignorance.
He'll be issuing medical exorcisms to rid people of this infection.  That would be better than giving him ANY control

His walking around the West Wing bugging people with “Got anything I can do? Any work I can help with?” was getting on WH staffers’ nerves. “Here Mike. See what you can do with this virus thing. “

Pence is patently unqualified to manage this crisis, but for whatever twisted reasons, Trump saw fit to appoint him Virus Czar. Trump, not Pence, made that ridiculous and dangerous decision. (I doubt that Pence asked for the job, even though it’s possible that he views a pandemic as a great way to hasten the end of days.) It will be the Trump administration, not Mike Pence, that history will judge for the mishandling of this crisis. Does anyone even remember Michael DeWayne Brown, the Bush appointee who was so tragically unequal to handling the response to Katrina? I had to look up his name. All that matters is that the disaster happened on Bush’s watch and “Brownie” worked for Bush. Trump may throw Pence under the bus if things go badly, but he can’t escape responsibility. Trump owns this."
2020-02-29 13:53,"President Trump does not have the leadership skills to steer us out of a pandemic; this is not about him, or politics, or even the stock market. Putting Mulvaney on the pulpit to say it's a hoax, lying about the number of confirmed cases in the U.S., and asking VP Pence to ""control the message"" will result in the death of thousands or even millions of Americans. I am begging senators, congresspersons, governors, and anybody with influence to either sideline President Trump until the crisis is mitigated, or to put an uncensored scientist in charge of the war against Covid-19."

2020-02-29 17:03,"In a 2001, when Pence was running for Congress, he wrote a post on his campaign website warning against ""the worst kind of Washington-speak"" about regulating tobacco.

""Time for a quick reality check. Despite the hysteria from the political class and the media, smoking doesn't kill. In fact, 2 out of every 3 smokers does not die from a smoking related illness and 9 out of ten smokers do not contract lung cancer.""  

So said ol' Pence, on his website.

Pence also said that ""back handed big government disguised in do-gooder health care rhetoric"" would be ""more harmful to the nation"" than second-hand smoke. He also equated the dangers of smoking to fatty foods, caffeine and sports utility vehicles.

The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says ""people who smoke cigarettes are 15 to 30 times more likely to get lung cancer or die from lung cancer than people who do not smoke.""

Years later, in Congress, Pence voted against legislation giving the Food and Drug Administration power to regulate the tobacco industry and adding new warning labels to tobacco products and ads. The bill passed, and President Obama signed it into law.

Pence....the bloke in charge of this new pandemic.

In his words: ""God Help Us."""
2020-02-28 10:02,"At this point the only way Trump can safely do a rally will be with a face mask and gloves, or in some type of glass cage. That will instill fear in his supporters. If he broadcast the rallies, they will wonder why he didn't show up. Eventually they'll wonder why the markets don't share his confidence. And when the rural hospitals start filling up, they'll wonder why it isn't on the news. Looks like he's in a corner now."

First world countries are very complicated systems that must be continuously improved and managed by capable professionals.  trump and his minions are anything but capable and professional so it’s no wonder that trump and his administration have together decided that the￼￼ PR battle of the Caronavirus is more important than the welfare of the people they have pledged to serve and protect.  Chaos, anger, bluster and incompetence at every step of the way has characterized this unfortunate presidency to the detriment of the nation and the world.  Re-electing trump and letting him be in charge for even one more minute beyond the length of his first term?  Nothing could be worse for our country and the world."
2020-02-28 11:06,"I thank NYT for this comprehensive reporting from around the world.

It will be of interest to many readers including myself if NYT provided a comparative picture of SARS in it's early stages to this Wuhan virus.

I used to live in Jakarta at time of SARS.  I recall there was likewise much hysteria over that virus –later proved to be unfounded.   It appears SARS was deadlier than Wuhan."

2020-02-28 11:30,"Although there are still many unknowns, it seems pretty clear that this has a two week (or longer) incubation period and that people can both carry and spread the virus without showing any symptoms. 

So that means that the cases now showing up all over the world are two weeks' worth of global air travel behind the actual spread - and thus that any efforts at ""containment"" are completely futile. Right? 

I understand that slowing the spread as much as possible is important to keep health facilities from being overwhelmed. But given how contagious this seems to be and how long it persists, is it really possible to slow things down meaningfully without confining everyone in the world to their houses for six months? Sure, let's all wash our hands, but is that actually going to do anything on a broader scale? 

I am not a public health expert and would be happy to be told why this is wrong."
2020-02-28 11:32,"The wide spread hysteria and economic panic are much worse than the coronavirus. Mortality is between 0.4-2% dependent on the age group and mainly effects risk groups with other compromising health issues, and this is without taking in account the many cases of asymptomatic people, in which case the mortality would be similar to the common flu. Bottom line coronavirus infection though novel is not much worse than the flu. Caution is warrant but public Hysteria due to media coverage is uncalled for. Finally, I am disgusted by how many journalists and readers blame Trump for the situation or mention him in articles responses related to the disease.  He did a fantastic job in a balanced sober presentation with Pence the CDC and the NIH on Wednesday."
2020-02-28 11:31,"The so-called 'West' is again failing poor, developing countries, who are now poised, but unprepared, to cope with a crisis not of their making. The World Bank is dragging its feet by not releasing critical funds in a timely manner for preparation initiatives, especially in Africa where only Senegal and South Africa have limited capacity. In all my years in global health advocacy, I've never seen such confusion, chaos, lack of coordination and cooperation."

The media sometimes inflates bad news. While this statement may represent the truth, it doesn't reflect the rates of growth inside as compared to those outside of China. So the whole story isn't told. 

While numbers of newly infected persons are increasing outside China, the numbers of newly infected persons are evidently in decline within China. A graph for each country on daily rates, increasing or decreasing, which the NYT is so good at, would be a more honest way to approach this story."

2020-02-28 12:58,"Many of the other affected nations have universal healthcare.  This will be a test of the United States' system of private care, including the high deductibles and co-pays that discourage people from getting the care they need.

In an epidemic, the health of each one of us is linked to the health of the unhealthiest around us.   Having great insurance yourself does not protect you.   Being healthy requires that everyone around you has access to the healthcare they need.

That's why healthcare is not an individual consumer product.   Everyone needs to have it, including the employees at the restaurants you eat it, the grocery store where you buy your food, the temp who works at your office, and the people you walk by occasionally."

2020-02-28 13:36,"What’s most mysterious about this outbreak is that we don’t know what, exactly, to fear.  Yes if an infected individual has a preexisting condition or otherwise weakened immune response, it’s dangerous, but then, so is influenza.  What sets COVID-19 apart so much that it justifies a panic?  Do scientists fear it will mutate into something more lethal?  Is it more lethal to healthy persons than is reported?  Or is this just a fear of the unknown, driven to panic levels by an overheated media response and mistrust of our own government’s announcements?  It’s really hard to discern."

ALL the deadly virus pandemics (with the exceptions of the MERS and Ebola pandemics) which have plagued the world, including the current version, SARS and all those going as far back as the 1918 influenza pandemic that killed more people than who died during WWI, have all originated from China.

China manages its economy on the cheap as the sources are China’s unregulated livestock industry which is a cesspool of dangerous viruses and bacteria. The science of the transfer of virus from animals to humans has been proved. There will be more pandemics originating from China as long as China’s livestock industry is unregulated.

If the coronavirus reaches Africa or large developing countries in south Asia (India, Pakistan, etc.) or in the west Pacific (Indonesia, Philippines, etc.) then it can spread to be a global disaster. This is because these countries do not have the infrastructure to deal with or control coronavirus.

What will China do to compensate the civilized world for the mismanagement and abuses of its economy and society, its unregulated reckless industries and its immeasurable vast theft of intellectual property that have taken so much away from the West?"

2020-02-28 13:28,"From the start, for whatever reason my mind and my instincts have predicted every course and turn of this virus.

I begged for the Planes from Italy , Japan, and south Korea to stop, to stop bringing the virus into our country, creating a thousand points of entry, a thousand Australian brush fires to be put out, now we have a thousand metaphorical brush fires starting up all over our country, as travelers come back from their dream vacations in Italy, spreading it in Ohio, Arkansas, etc. Major cities, where international  businessmen have meetings, will be hit hard, NYC, Chicago, LA, etc, they will get off Planes, where they will infect 2 or 3 people, they will infect Uber drivers, who will infect other passengers, and on and on it will go. Even now if the Planes were stopped it would be as bad as it will get, but it looks like that will not happen.

The virus comes in waves, remember it has a 7 to 14 day incubation period , so every week comes another wave of sick people, it will last in the United States, through March and April and will become a part of everyday life, it will relinquish as the weather warms up and becomes more humid, different for every state. It will probably weaken, as the weeks go by as it is a derivative of SARS, which mysteriously faded away almost over night.

Restaurants, movie theaters, sporting events will suffer, as will revenues from subways, trains, and buses, creating shortfalls in city budgets.
By July it will be history.

You test so that you can provide the right medical support, and also to isolate, backtrack contacts and isolate/monitor them in turn to prevent further spread of this fairly unknown disease in the community--protecting, especially, the most vulnerable populations. You also test for future science, to understand how this new infectious disease works. 

Partly, the alarm comes from media coverage, which sometimes makes it seem as scary as possible. The media also gives only confirmed numbers without any context or numbers tested. Remember from science class: results mean little when you don't know the methodology. You can end up comparing apples to oranges. (Example: UK had 15 confirmed yesterday out of 7,690 tested, which can be a very different number in significance than US's 14 confirmed out of 445 tested plus 45 confirmed out of ??? (all evacuees) tested. Another example: South Korea has 70,990 tested, 2022 confirmed and 13 deaths. Iran has ? tested, 388 confirmed and 34 deaths. Are you sure Korea has the larger outbreak?) The media only focuses on the number of confirmed cases as if that were the extent of the disease, punishing countries who test and make data public, and providing an disincentive for countries to test and get their numbers higher (as seen in your Italy article and as possibly seen in Japan's slowness to test in combination to drastic actions in"

Slowly the things that divide us, will fade away and the tomfoolery of the beltway  will subside. Every man and women will be tested, some will run and hide and others will rush to the front lines.

Like a lightning bolt out of the blue our whole world is being transformed, we are now living through a great decisive moment in history and new Winston Churchills are about to be found, new foot soldiers, like our grandfathers who fought at the battle of the bulge and Omaha Beach, there DNA is still in us.
  The United States always has been a nation of heroes, this is our country, it belongs to us, and as always it will be the common every day heroes, the nurses, the EMS , the police officers, the bus drivers, subway conductors, and the man and women in the street who will save us and get us through to better days.

Rather than quarantine whole cities, we need to persuade Americans to simply stay home if they are sick. Instead we are expected to show up at work when we are half dead. And we can't keep our kids home because we have to work so they spread illnesses to schools and child care facilities. Only a handful can afford to take time off.

In some countries only people with evident disease conditions have been tested and a accounted, and the number of tests is in the 100s order. In other countries anyone with even a minimal possibility to have been in contact with the virus has been tested and tests are in the 10000s order. Quite obvious, statistically, that you shall expect at least one order of magnitude more positive cases where testing has been massive. So... stop worrying of cases like Italy, which is where there were tests in the 10000s number (above) area, and worry to places where there were 100s tests (France, UK, USA, Germany, ....) which are likely to be the same number of affected people then in Italy, but ""you just do not know"". Another statistical evidence is that severe cases in Italy are in the order of 100 (a bit less) which is exactly the number of cases in places where tests are performe only where there are evident symptoms.

Dear journalists, and politicians, learn science, and learn statistics before hitting the keyboard or going in front of a camera.

And anyone of them can spread it to others. And because we are not screening, nor testing sick people, the problem will go undetected until it is too late.

The level of irresponsibility being shown by the Trump is astounding. I may blame China for spreading this plague, but I BLAME TRUMP's ineptitude for making every American citizen play Russia roulette every time we go out into a public space. 

More than that, we cannot gather accurate information if we don't understand the scope of the spread. Perhaps it's 2% but 2% of what? The known cases? What about the unknown?

....and I was starting to calm down about the risk until I read about the four deaths from the Diamond Princess. Say what you want about their ages, but those four people went on vacation healthy enough to enjoy it and now they are not alive."
2020-02-28 14:42,"Oh boy.  Yesterday the country count was 43; this morning, 53.  And meanwhile, in Iran, reportedly only 388 cases and 34 deaths.  That's a fatality rate of nearly 10%.  So, either the virus that is infecting people in Iran is a mutated form with a much higher kill rate, or the Iranians are grossly under-reporting the actual number of cases that exist in the country, either deliberately (to try and prevent a countrywide panic?) or out of sheer ignorance and lack of personnel (not to mention lack of test kits).  Oh brother.  What we'll most likely never know: how did the virus arrive in Iran?"

2020-02-28 14:51,"Wouldn't it make sense at some point to urge the people in the at-risk group to reduce their interactions with the world? I know this has downsides, including depression, but it could also reduce the burden faced by healthcare facilities. Pensioners particularly should be in a position not to be surrounded with many people. While increasing isolation in facilities for the elderly would be straining, an epidemic in the same facilities would be catastrophic. 
I for one told my elderly parents to avoid crowded places and go out only for food supplies (there's an ocean between us and I worry that no one would be there to take care of them)."
2020-02-28 15:00,"It's too late for testing at scale to matter. The virus is out in the community; we are not going to be able to trace everyone anymore. And even if we could, we are either unwilling or unable to implement effective quarantines. At some point it's going to be counter productive, prompting people who are not life-threateningly ill to go out and about to their doctors, quick cares, and ERs, infecting everyone else, and also jamming up the healthcare system.

People need to just start acting as if it's already around in their community. Basic precautions are not especially onerous. 

Test people who had consistent symptoms who died or who are very ill admitted to hospitals. Then we still can keep an eye on severity in a more manageable way and escalate the response (e.g., canceling school) accordingly. It's too late to do the epidemiological and containment work that is the reason for wide scale testing."
2020-02-28 14:55,"I see the plan now. Let's not test people, keeping our numbers nice and low. Sure, some people will die from ""pneumonia"", but that will be under the radar and a few years later, nobody will remember.

There are no republicans, no democrats now. The corona Virus doesn't pick favorites, rich or poor, black or white, christian or muslim it all the same to a virus. It's the ultimate lesson that there is so much more that unites us than divides us. I pledge to spend every hour here in the white house, working on this problem, a committee of the best scientists and medical professionals is being assembled. We will get through this just as the United States has always gotten through the bad times, as we got through world war 2, 9/11 and so many others, with courage and a united spirit. Everything that can be done will be done, and i pledge to do whatever i can to end this crises swiftly, you have my vow. I will  have daily reports on the spread of the virus. And i ask my colleagues on the other side of the aisle to end all animosity, and come together in this time of crises, I have spoken to speaker Pelosi and have invited her to sit on the committe assembled to stop the spread of Corona virus, let us all work together now.

Stay home if you get sick and see a doctor if you have high fever or respiratory issues right away. For over 80% it's no more than a cold.  I believe the entire city of Milan is infected as every article with a new case in Europe starts with ""the man, who recently returned from Milan,. . . ."" and they weren't all at the same place in Milan.  Yet, the death rate remains virtually unchanged in Italy.  Many believe, when all is said and done, there are so many cases with extremely mild symptoms that the rate of fatality may be 20 times less than they think.  The first woman who recovered in Italy said her only symptom was a headache for 3 days.  I just spoke to a work colleague in NYC who complained of a sore throat and a headache and she was coughing and she has no plans to see a doctor.  We need to relax and get on with our lives.

2020-02-28 15:30,"This virus is not more lethal that the flu. There are probably many asymptomatic carriers of the virus as well as mild cases which aren’t raised to the attention of doctors. If we count those cases, the lethality rate is low. 

Additionally, if we ran the numbers, i would guess that smokers have a higher chance of developing pneumonia...and in many countries, it is the older male population that holds on to this habit. Unlike the US where smoking is not as prevalent.

The media needs to stop stoking fear about this virus and report the facts in their proper context. Otherwise they bear responsibility for the economic fall out."
2020-02-28 15:40,"Why are we not taking defensive measures against this virus BEFORE cases are confirmed? Schools in NY should be closed, public transportation should be minimized, and whatever other measures the city is planning to enact AFTER we have widespread cases, should be put in place ASAP.

It's just common sense: If in 2 weeks time we have hundreds of confirmed infections, that means that right now the virus is spreading and infections are taking place as we speak and do nothing. Why are we giving the virus a chance to infect people? Why not enact this measure before panic sets in, before people start getting sick and, probably, dying?

Reacting instead of preventing is a dangerous gamble."
2020-02-28 16:09,"Yep: perfect timing: the seasonal, autumn-to-winter shift to the southern hemisphere brings the coronavirus with it. Should see coronavirus cases now populate the southern hemisphere (South America, Australia, Africa etc.), while northern hemisphere cases (depending on the the adequacy of testing apparatuses) begin to level-off with more sunshine, moisture and higher temperatures. All latitudinal and highly related to climate and transmission rates,
so watch the shift."

By doing so, it's generating the most useful data on this illness. At this point, the rate of death is less than 1 percent (13 out of 2337--0.56%). Obviously, we need to know more but placing the lethality of the virus in context could tamp down the panic that seems to be getting out of control. The rate of transmission and lethality seems to be tracking very close to the common flu. Thankfully, ordinary precautions against common flu are the best practices for avoiding COVID-19. Stay calm and wash your hands."

Pretty much everyone else is recovering without too much difficulty. China has already released thousands of recovered patients. There has yet to be a single death in the US.

The allegedly omnipotent CDC can't even put out a proper test kit after two months heads up, and they've only tested 445 people in the whole USA of 330 million! There's no plan. What are workers supposed to do if quarantined, and no pay check? Not pay the bills or mortgage? What are working parents supposed to do when schools are closed? Stay home and lose their pay or job? Not pay the bills? Will Wall Street/Washington forgive the debts, keep paying quarantined employees? Obviously not. The CDC solemnly advises everyone on food stamps and in poverty to stock 2 weeks of food, when they can barely eat enough as it is. The one thing that is for sure working people will bear the brunt and pay with their lives for the preventable Coronavirus catastrophe caused by Wall Street and their incompetent government, and bear all the economic hardship too."

This will keep sick people off buses, trains, during rush hour, and out of the work place. Because believe me if i walk into any store and a employee is coughing i am turning around and walking out, as everyone should

we may have to implement a no coughing rule that people with a cough are not allowed to enter stores, arrangements can be made for stores to bring you what they need, many stores have this option already, there is no need for you to go out and about with your cough.

Nobody is doing anything and every minute of the day more people are flying into this country with corona virus, going to work sick, getting on trains sick. They are spreading it through every corner of our country, soon we will be worse off than China.

2020-02-28 19:11,"A reminder about one of the biggest reasons America gives foreign assistance: TO PROTECT AMERICAN CITIZENS AND AMERICAN SECURITY. 

We are, unfortunately, seeing an example of this play out right now. In 2018, Trump cut funding to the CDC's program for global response to epidemics by 80%, forcing the CDC to shut down programs in 39 of the 49 countries where they had operated. Among the countries where the program was shut down: China.

Some people ask why the USA spends so much money helping foreigners fight diseases when we have serious health care issues at home. The reason for the CDC global programs that Trump gutted is simple: the best way to prevent a pandemic from ravaging the USA is to contain and treat a disease in the country (or countries) where it began BEFORE it can jump to the USA. 

The aggressive US response to Ebola in Africa was a great example of how American assistance to foreign countries helps keep Americans at home safe. The gutting of the CDC's budget and the firing of the National Security team responsible for coordinating a response to emerging diseases is an example of how Trump's mindless budget cuts and anti-professional bias are putting Americans in danger.

It is also true that American assistance improves the lives of millions of poor people around the globe, which is a very good thing, but we should never lose sight of the fact that the #1 beneficiary of American assistance abroad are Americans living in the USA."

The one thing we know from all these walls is they all failed in their purpose and were a waste of resources that ultimately contributed to their nations collapse.

2020-02-28 20:40,"The graph in the section, ""How bad will it get?"" tells us a lot; it tells us where this corona virus stands in deadliness and contagion compared to other well known infections. What's striking is that the peach colored area for this virus is huge compared to the pin point areas of the other infections plotted here. That tells us we have yet to understand how dangerous covid 19 is; it is still an unknown pathogen and unknowns always fuel anxiety. It is the vertical axis that's the most variable, so this tell us there is much uncertainty of its fatality rate. I think this is because we don't know how many people contracted this virus without coming to medical attention; we know the ones that got to a hospital but we don't know how many subclinical cases have occured.

I hope the Times continues to update us on this graph; that peach colored area will surely shrink down as cases develop and conclusions can be drawn. And let's have a source for this graph. It's surely a reputable source since it plots exactly what we need to know about how dangerous this virus is."

 Does infection return to those who had it and got over it, like I just read is already happening in Wuhan to some early patients?  
Do you become immune once you have contracted it? 
What is the status  of a possible vaccine?
Once infected does the virus remain active in the body after recovery?
How is the human immune system reacting to the virus?
Can humans infect animals like pets and vice-versa, like it happened already to a dog of an infected patient?

I know it's early in the crisis but the world needs to know more specific info on Coronavirus, and on future risks of other possible similar viruses."

Given the CDC has tested less than 500 people in the US and China alone has tested a thousand times that, not including pets, it’s clear the US is flying blind. Perhaps healthcare would be of more interest to the parent of a sick child than an interest rate cut or tax break. Never mind that an interest rate cut isn’t going to boost production when workers stay home from illness. Looking at the COVID-19 infection rate in China when they tried to ignore/hide the problem (as we are now) shows we’ve barely just begun to see the impacts.

Yes, it may be more contagious and the incubation period is longer which leads to more people getting the virus and spreading it before they know they have it. If you are healthy to begin with, you'll pull through. If your immune system is compromised because you smoke, are in poor health, or older, then it's a little more dicey. Outcomes for those people are similar to what happens if you catch a cold or the flu. I think the world is over-reacting. No one freaks like they are now when it's flu season, and close to 56k people in the USA die from it each year, and countless more world wide."

If this is nothing worse than a seasonal flu then why all the pictures out of China with people in hazmat suits fumigating streets and shops?

This makes me think that how frequently you are exposed to people w/ the virus may be an important factor in whether you survive an infection.

2020-02-28 21:15,"The US Navy is repeating the same mistake made with the Diamond Princess cruise: Keeping all sailors quarantined on their ship maximizes how many of them will get infected.  This highlights the continued ineptitude of the Trump administration. What should be done is: 1. Bring all ships to one or more dedicated harbors where all people on the ship can be triaged by adequately protected personnel, 2. Run immediate blood tests on everyone, 3, Immediately divide people into 2 groups: those who are sick and those who are not.  Once blood test results are known, divide the asymptomatic sailors according to those who are asymptomatic but test negative, and those who test positive but are asymptomatic.  Anyone who becomes ill in this latter group should be moved to the first group. By doing this fewer people will become sick (saving lives and costs) as well as shortening the time of quarantine for many, if not most of the sailors.  I am a retired physician but this is largely and simply a logic problem. Keeping sailors on the ships, where proper quarantining can not be performed, is reckless and harmful."

Much less often, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea. Confirmation of infection requires a test for the nucleic acid, which takes time. Most people will have very low white blood cell count. Any age can get it, most are between 35 and 58. Reports that primarily the elderly are at risk is greatly exaggerated; greater risk depends on your general health. Fatality rates are not really known, but between 1% and 3%. If you have high blood pressure or heart disease or any problem with your immune system, you are at greater risk, but by how much is not really known. Average time from exposure to first symptom is 4 days. Death can occur within 10 days, especially if you have trouble breathing. Death is due to organ failure.

Vacaville houses those outlet malls and shopping centers, including those frequented by students from UC Davis and UC Berkeley (enroute to the mountains), among many other campuses. Santa Clara County has Silicon Valley's major airport. So neither of these patients needed to go to Wuhan or know someone who did, nor do they need to have worked in healthcare or at Travis AFB.

It also bears repeating that Trump’s cuts to government programs is in line with other Republican fiscal policy — namely, tax cutter Grover Norquist’s statement that he would like to shrink government to the size where he could drown it in a bathtub.

2) If you are a relatively healthy person, don’t put the immunocompromised individuals in your community at risk.

China was only screening for symptomatic people in their airports.

Does anyone know if work is being done to determine if it shows markers that that might be the case? Are they tracking those who have recovered to ensure there isn't a boomerang effect?

I remain curious that China kicked into such high gear so fast. Don't get me wrong; it's great that they did but nothing like that happened for SARS and MERS which have, on the face of it, much higher fatality rates (7% compared to this 1-3% fatality rate). 

My daughter called me from college to ask if it made sense to me that billions would be locked down almost instantly over (at that time) 26 deaths. No. It did not.  Perhaps they've just learned from the past, but I wish we could know exactly what they know. 

And if there is even a remote chance of a 1918 scenario, we had better be told pronto.Because that one killed, depending on who's counting, close to a hundred million people (some historians put it significantly lower). 

The good news is that China does seem to be bouncing back quite well and chances are great that this will play out as it has in China, with one bad hit and then dissipation. Here's hoping for the best.

 No matter the outcome, let's learn from this and vow to work harder on global preparedness."
2020-02-29 1:00,"Bruce Aylward, the lead doctor for the WHO team which recently returned from China, did not think we were prepared and said if he had Covid-9, he would prefer to be treated in China.  ""How many ventilators do the hospitals have?"" He asked.  NY Times reporter on ""The Daily"" said ventilators cost about the same as a car and need three personnel (respiratory techs) to monitor.  
I hope the hospitals are able to get sufficient ventilators, not just surgical masks. 
Also the Trump Administration  and the CDC, by not giving doctors test kits and using overly strict criteria to test, are letting the virus spread in all of our communities.  A doctor from the CDC (Redfield) even told Congress that it was not necessary for the public to purchase cleaning supplies.  This does not seem like wise advice. Even if we come into contact with Covid-9 virus, keeping surfaces clean would help reduce the viral load so that our body could fight it off more easily."
2020-02-28 23:35,Have all the cases been in colder areas?  Maybe if there are no cases in the Southern Hemisphere that would be a good sign that warm weather will stop it.￼
2020-02-28 23:52,A quarantine won't work if personnel aren't protected.   Thanks to the whistleblower we know personnel were not protected on two CA bases when Americanswere broughtback from China.   Staff shouldn't have been allowed to be off base unless they themselves passed quarantine as well.

At a Hospital ER in southeastern MA, they had no idea what to do with him.  ER staff told my husband that they had no protocols for dealing with people coming from Italy.  They said he did not meet the criteria for a coronavirus test, even though the media has been reporting that the CDC updated the criteria to include symptomatic persons coming from Italy, South Korea and Iran. The ER personnel knew nothing about this. They tested him for the flu, saying that if he was positive for a known flu, they could rule out coronavirus. The flu test came back negative.  A chest x-ray did not show cause for concern. They sent him home without a diagnosis, and did not even tell him to self-quarantine! This country is NOT prepared for a pandemic."

American manufacturing and creativity will be put to the test - other countries were dependent on cheap Chinese labor to make medical equipment as well..  so supplies will be short.
Having clean water and soap will slow the spread - giving us time to increase production of medical equipment to treat the outbreak.  
(It is said that plumbers have saved more human life than any other profession.  - In this case it may be true!!)"
2020-02-29 1:39,"Wondering if companies will move manufacturing out of China, at least in part, due to this sort of situation likely occurring again - since many pandemics seem to start in China.

Italy’s quarantine of 10 towns is clearly not enough and hotel in Spain is letting people leave after 4 days. You can look at Iran for what would happen if no quarantine is in place.

South Korea isn’t doing much better but that’s because they are dealing with a 200000 members cult that hid the outbreak and have members go into hiding."
2020-02-28 23:20,I am so shocked at how lightly the Trump Administration is taking this potential disaster to our country.

I say ""fascinating"" because several Fed officials made statements today. At least one (Bullard) indicated he'd only support rate cuts if ""the WHO declared a worldwide pandemic"". Guess we'll be waiting on that rate cut for awhile, eh?"
2020-02-28 23:27,Some commenters are blaming both media hype and politics. You remember when there were Ebola cases reported in the US in 2014? The government response was overwhelming and swift. And the loudest voice making political hay out of the issue? Donald Trump.
2020-02-29 0:28,"It’s pretty clear to me that the officials who brought back the people sick with coronavirus in the back of a plane separated by plastic sheeting from the other 300 cruise ship passengers brought it into CA. Then, because the officials there were not trained and did not have the right equipment and did not quarantine themselves but instead went about their lives, then they infected the general population in Northern CA. 

So basically, the ineptitude of this administration is why the coronavirus is circling around Northern CA right now."

I thought the ""free market"" just automatically knew what, and how much, to produce? Is the Republican party now giving up on another of its sacred beliefs, like they did with tariffs and the national debt? Are they treading on the path to, horrors!, socialism? Say it ain't so, Joe, er, donald.

And, if this is just an evil Dem.media plot to bring down trump, why the need for the War Powers Act? After all, this is just a common cold, right?

In a comment yesterday I gently surmised a theory or two, only to have my head figuratively separated from my body and mounted on the official 'New York Times Commenters Stick'.  One even went so far as to question my sanity.  Ouch!

Let me try again.  Is it possible that these outlier cases could be originating from a new, or 'novel', form of the virus virus now presenting here in the United States (and also Germany, at latest count)?  Perhaps infected poultry has made its way to our shores?  That would one plausible explanation, given that all cases heretofore could be traced back to Wuhan, but with these outliers, that human link in the chain is notably absent---or at least, certainly not obvious.

I will not even dare suggest again the possibility of human malfeasance, as was my regret yesterday.  As much as it might be plausible, given human nature and history both, I find my head useful.  I'd like to keep it."
2020-02-28 23:57,"When reporting about the US, please focus on the # of deaths and # of actual verified cases of corona, from direct contact with China vs. no direct contact. I have to also question whether the second supposedly no-contact case that was diagnosed in San Jose today really was in fact that. There is a lot of travel to and from San Jose to China due to its proximity to Silicon Valley. What if someone this person interacted with did not answer truthfully at Customs or is lax at self-quarantine? These are really important questions that need to be asked in terms of determining transmission."

2020-02-29 1:32,"""Mick Mulvaney, the acting White House chief of staff, on Friday blamed the media for exaggerating the seriousness of coronavirus because “they think this will bring down the president, that’s what this is all about.”

I wish the Trump administration would just get over themselves!  The coronavirus is not limited by political affiliations.   This is a global pandemic!  I am more concerned that the CDC give all medical staff  clear guidelines on how to identify, control and treat this disease!

Rather then letting political paranoia run rampant, why isn't there more collaboration between countries with actual experience treating patients presenting with this disease!

The political accusations and blaming is absolutely ludicrous! Peoples lives are at risk!"
2020-02-28 23:22,So then let the American media follow the administration and downplay the virus like they did in China. Is that what Trump wants?
2020-02-28 23:10,"I love how this had to become political. Everyone wants to point a finger to push their own personal agenda. I think instead of sides to be on people should focus on actions. Are the necessary precautions being taken? Do you even know what precautions should be taken? Have you even checked if said precautions have been made? If people focus on our differences, point fingers and make this about politics both sides will be less willing to cooperate and more people will get sick. Listen to yourselves, trump this trump that, the primitives, I dont like sub-saharan, america is a third world country, Im going to lose money, we need a democrat to be on tv everyday telling us its going to be ok, etc,etc. Do you think any of that rhetoric is going to protect the American people? The cdc is who should be handling this with the presidents support so unless that is not the case why be at eachothers throats. On a side note how often do you get cooperation from someone youre punching in the face? Americans are losing common sense to sensationalist drama then charge forward to the beat of a rhetoric drum losing all credibility they once had because instead of using logic they let there emotions guide their actions in a left vs right fight where everybody loses. If you want something ask yourself how can I get this in the most constructive way that will be supported by all without hurting anyone, if you do no wrong who can stand against you?

Even if half of the total global population were to die, which is certainly not going to happen, we would still have over 3.5 billion survivors. 3.5 billion is much higher than what human population has been for the entirety of human history, except for the last few decades. 

We humans are the worst plague to have ever happened on planet earth. No virus can kill enough of us to make a significant impact on the damage we are doing to this planet every day. Maybe if something was to kill 99% of us it might help. I do not have high hopes of that happening."

At a time when we need to hear from respected physicians like Dr. Anthony Fauci, Director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases at the National Institutes of Health, and Dr. Nancy Messonnier, the Director of the Center for the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases at the Centers for Disease Control, they are being muzzled by President Trump and Vice President Trump, and even being attacked by others like Rush Limbaugh who have no health expertise. The attempt to politicize what is a national and international disaster only increases the panic among the public and the uncertainty in the financial markets. It's time for them to stop the blame and the political spin and to try telling the truth. It's time to let the experts speak while they stay quiet and to remember that ""sunlight is the best disinfectant."""

He stayed home today and called a doctor to be cleared to go back to work per his company regulations. How many people have traveled back from Italy or France? Experts said the virus had been in Italy for weeks before it was noticed. I really think at-risk people should be protected, particularly the very many people who are on immuno suppressants and have no choice but to go to work.  Online work should be encouraged whenever possible. At this point,  anything that can slow both the propagation and the number of severe cases should be considered."
2020-02-29 3:32,"I would like someone from Trump's administration to get through to him the difference between the coronavirus and the common flu/cold is the incubation period. Flu and colds have short incubation periods, a few days. Coronaviruses have longer incubation periods. The longer the incubation period, the harder it is to control the spread. Schools all over the world close down for a week because of the flu. That will not work for the coronavirus."

As far as I know, that is the numbers that China is reporting. We have no other source that says it is that severe. Maybe Iran. How much do we really trust these numbers, and how likely are they to lie, or be incapable of knowing the truth because they are authoritarian punch down countries who demand that their edicts are fact when the facts disagree. I somewhat doubt they are that coordinated as to be capable of pulling off such a hoax, but it's possible. It is however very likely that they don't know the actual number of cases and so don't know the death rate, but report as if their numbers are exact, because that is what authoritarians do. Much like you see out of Trump these days.

I'll bet the death rate is way below 2%. I base that on numbers reported for health care workers where 1700 got ill and 6 died. That would mean a death rate for presumably otherwise healthy people of 0.35%, which is way below 2% but still about 3 times higher than a normal flu. So still serious but not the massive killer that people feared.

It's highly unlikely that it will be contained. If you have two unknown sourced cases that are tested and confirmed, you have many others that have not yet surfaced or who will never go to a doctor for a cold."

At that time, the flu virus, when combined with nasal mucus,  was capable of surviving for over two weeks on bank notes. I’m certain the same will be found with the Coronavirus. So wash frequently, properly, avoid touching your eyes or nose with your hands, and sneeze/cough into a tissue or onto your clothed arms. Use common sense, and avoid panic.

On Feb  27 The Gov of California confirms 31 Coronavirus cases ,the same day Public Health Dept confirms only 10 while the Center for Disease Control & Prevention confirms the first public person to person transmission in Solano County; a dangerous tipping point in the transmission of this highly contagious disease .Not such confusing data ,but down right dangerous & incompetent.

When you know that South Korea's cases jumped by 40% from Feb 26 to Feb 27 (1,261 to 1,766) despite aggressive containment measures ,America needs to be alert, alarmed & active in its measures !

The death rate is hovering around 2%

America has about 300,000,000 people.

Thirty percent of the 300M is about 100M people.

Two percent of that is 2,000,000 Americans.

The C Virus threat is a golden opportunity for 2020 Dem candidates to make this the big issue in the debates and town halls. 

Push for national paid sick leave, and universal health care, necessary for protection against epidemics.  Our candidates and the media need to start discussing the various models of financing HC that have long operated in dozens of democracies.   

Wikipedia—“Paid sick leave is a statutory requirement in most European, many Latin American, a few African and Asian countries…”

W. Post--  “Employers who don’t offer paid sick leave are making flu (or any virus) season worse --- and hurting their own bottom line.”

“ Per Bureau of Labor Statistics, 28 percent of U.S. civilian workers — about 45 million  — have no access to paid sick leave.”

So millions of Americans-- “have a choice: go to work sick, or stay home and forgo pay.”
Millions of Americans have no or little savings, and need what income they earn for basic needs like rent and groceries.   

NYT– How to Prepare for the Virus ----- 
… “many people who work in minimum-wage jobs do not get sick days….. they often must work when ill, despite public contact. ”
Public contact---that means all of us. 

Our political culture's distorted opposition to national government mandates, leaves all of us less protected than people in other modern nations.  Where is that big story in the media?"

The outbreak in Wuhan spread much more rapidly due to the Chinese government's propaganda, inaction, and slow action. When Chinese citizens can smuggle their words around censorship, they are furious.  

Here, Alex M. Azar II, the health and human services secretary, warned us on Wednesday it can easily happen here, and as a result he has been effectively demoted by Trump. He now effectively reports to VP Mike Pence, known for the HIV outbreak in Indiana he refused to stop as governor. Trump and Pence have no credibility at all regarding this threat.

Third, it seems likely that the patient currently at UCDavis, who had to wait days to be tested for the coronavirus, came into contact with one of the people freely moving on and off Travis Air Force Base.

Other than feeding his narcissism and stoking his base, Trump has proven to utterly incompetent, and his administration has spread the incompetence across the entire federal government.

2020-02-27 23:33,"I'm beginning to think that this admin sees this problem as just another bump in the road that can be dealt with by tweets and Trump's merry gang of Fox News hosts.  Honestly can't blame them, it has worked so far.  Why funnel money to protect Americans when it can instead be spent at Mar a Lago?  

The more sinister and conspiritorial side of me thinks that Trump, and especially Pence, see this as god's way of purging the US.  ""Let the virus ravage these liberal cities!  They deserve it for questioning our dear leader!"""
2020-02-27 23:47,"I’m waiting for Pence to sweep in and have his “heckuva job Brownie!” moment, shouldn’t be too long given his illustrious track record with outbreaks."
2020-02-28 0:20,With Pence “in charge” of this we are all in supreme danger. May goddess help us because this administration sure won’t.
2020-02-28 0:29,I'm afraid this is going to get much worse before it gets better. What will the Trump administration say when thousands or millions are infected? And the market loses 50% of its value? And Trump is finally exposed for the incompetent fraud that he is? Answer: Nothing. His base and Fox will still be with him and he will probably win reelection. This is what happens when you suppress information. The whole nation will be kept in the dark just like the Fox audience.
2020-02-27 23:23,"So, let's get this straight. The Trump administration sent HHS personnel to meet, house and manage returning refugees from Wuhan and the Diamond Princess, who were exposed to a new and potentially lethal infection. Those people were given NO training in infection control, and knew nothing about pandemics or Nonpharmacologic Interventions (NPIs).

When Azar was asked whether the staff had appropriate PPE, he said, ""They should have had,"" and when asked about chaos on the ground, said 
“I would not accept your proposition that it was chaotic at all times,” Mr. Azar said. “I am not aware of any violation of quarantine or isolation protocols.”

Then 
""agency staff members who found themselves on the front lines of a frantic federal effort to confront the coronavirus in the United States without any preparation or training, and whose own health concerns were dismissed by senior administration officials as detrimental to staff “morale.” They were “admonished,” the complaint said, and “accused of not being team players,” and had their “mental health and emotional stability questioned.”""

So, first Trump abolished TWO organizations set up to deal with pandemics, set up by Obama, then HHS has no idea how to deal with a quarantine, doesn't even ASK CDC, the guy in charge doesn't know about any problems, and when notified, blames the staff who were never trained.

This is what I expect from a third world dictatorship, or the US under the GOP.

For shame."
2020-02-27 23:53,Totally incompetent! Do we any leadership that knows what they are doing? Of course you blame the people deployed for not being team players when they realize they don’t have the correct protective gear.

We are behaving like the Chinese now. No wonder the president praised Xi."

If only they hadn't made a point to eliminate the US Agency for International Development program called Predict (set up in 2005, during the H1N5 bird flu scare, to identify and research infectious diseases in animal populations).
Combine these two decisions with massive reductions in CDC programs, and the consequence is heightened contagion risk.
I guess it was important to destroy an Obama program in order to capture all that money saved to pay for the narcissist-in-chief's golf trips to Bedminster and Mar-A-Lago (a game played an average of three days weekly for the last three years). 
Those $650/night rooms the Secret Service has to reserve and the million dollar Air Force One plane rides won't pay for themselves.

That the last thing in the world they would’ve wanted was for the first instance of community transmission on US soil to be traced directly from Solano County to Travers Air Force Base to that abhorrent decision.

But no. The current administration, top to bottom, is as arrogant, callous and heedless as it is incompetent. That’s what happens when people see they can get away with anything because they’re above the law."
2020-02-28 0:45,"Like so much of what is wrong with America today. There is a massive delta between the rhetoric and the actual. As a former virologist and biochemist I can only express disgust at Trump's speech about how prepared and good America's response has been and will be. His insecure arrogance spouted all sorts of nonsense, none of which was scientifically close to accurate. The man doesn't have the brains to let an expert speak when one is needed. He doesn't know the difference between an influenza virus and a coronavirus nor a virus and a bacteria. I'm sure he missed his science briefing because it was probably longer than 2 min and was scheduled for before 11am while he was still watching the Fox and Friends. Speaking of which, as far as children's shows go Fox and Friends does have a catchy name for a children's program but Peppa Pig has far more intelligent scripting, bigger words, a more correct use of the English language and overall better dialogue. Peppa and Daddy Pig would definitely know to use proper safety protocols when dealing with a pandemic."

When you populate your government with sycophants yes men and you alienate, drive out, and fire people with actual experience and expertise, overwhelming incompetence is the inevitable result.

He may not have created COVID-19 but he stripped our government of its ability to mount a competent response and that is just one of many failings that make him completely unfit to be our president."

It is important to understand that the White House trying to control the message will result in the spread of the disease and further distrust of the government and the 'Anti-science, Alternative Facts"" Trump administration."

Thank God the whistleblower filed her complaint so HHS sees why suddenly surprise patients are starting to crop up.

I sure hope Trump doesn't now lash out at this whistleblower, penalizing her for calling out the truth.

This is no way to run a country in the midst of a dangerous health crisis."
2020-02-28 1:03,"Back in the 1980s, I ran a small hospital for children - in a very old building.  We had to remain diligent at all times to have decent infection control.
Now I guess as a nation, we're reduced to washing our hands a lot and using hand wash substances with high alcohol content plus staying home if we have any sort of cold or compromised immune system.
Not bad advice, but a bit skimpy for a giant country like the U.S.
It's past due time to have someone with competence as our president - a person who doesn't dump staff if he/she wakes up on the wrong side of bed. Vote in November - my hope is that the someone is Senator Sanders."

Trump is concerned that this looks bad for him.  His natural response to any crisis is to lie, cover up his own mistakes, and blame others.  VP Pence will do whatever Trumps says.  We cannot trust anything they say.
Under Obama, the US government was prepared.  But after Trump cut the budget of the CDC two years ago, experts predicted that this would hurt American preparedness:

2020-02-28 1:35,"Trump’s disdain for government institutions will literally kill us. This reminds me of the disaster at Chernobyl in which warnings were ignored because of fear of displeasing those in charge. It was just a matter of time before Trump’s norm-busting and repugnance of government order and processes would result in actual physical harm. I think of someone like Elizabeth Warren as president and she would have had plans locked in place on those military bases. There would have been order, preparation, proper training, safeguards and appropriate resources. This is a case where chaos could kill. Trump knows only chaos and distraction. Not what we need to meet the challenge of a pandemic. 

This president is such a bully and has everyone so intimidated that the only way we get the truth is through a courageous whistleblower.  For the second time. Trump will downplay this fiasco and is probably roaming the White House in his extra-large bathrobe composing vitriolic tweets to say the whistleblower is part of the deep state and that this report is fake news.

And Pence is in charge.

If the whistleblower had not come forward, how long would this fiasco have continued? How many will now contract the virus due to this administration’s fealty to a man unfit for his office. Any office."

All true, but the real issue is that this is no longer a government with the well being of the people as a foremost concern.  It is an undemocratic, authoritarian president and his elected and unelected enablers who care more about loyalty, power, money and control than about scientific truth and health of the general populace.  See the parallels with Xi's response to the virus: it was more important to him to cover up bad news then to work to investigate the actual problems of a potential pandemic.  In the just-past (great) old days, we would have the best people, the best scientists, operating as a team (without a political litmus test) to see us through. No longer. But guess what?  A virus like this is blind to party, race, gender, money  and hierarchy."

And what terrible, willful ignorance and selfishness of those federal employees and their supervisors.  This is exactly the kind of carelessness and/or unlawfulness that causes pandemics and other human-made or human-facilitated major disasters.   No wonder communities don’t want the evacuated housed in quarantine there — it’s not prejudice against the ill or possibly ill; it’s (apparently reasonable) distrust of the government workers (healthcare providers and otherwise) who come in contact with the ill or previously-exposed and their belongings and waste.

I feel most sorry for these careless workers’ families, who will probably be personally impacted by community spread."

2020-02-28 1:02,"Is Trump responsible for this one too?  It seems like a lot of decisions were badly made by people who were mid level career people and so had been around prior to Trump. It would be nice to know just how the paper ( was it the Post?) obtained information about the complaint and the other unnamed sources of information. And, why was not the entire complaint leaked so we can see this all in context?  One would hope that all those people who were in the company of people who were exposed have been contacted and are being monitored and if need be put in quarantine.   Not clear here is if the people who were exposed on the Princess ship or wherever had masks on or were in any other way secured personally against exposing others. I suppose this will all come out or will it?"

I, for one, believe this administration is not prepared for a pandemic, but, as I said above, time will tell.
Here's the main thing, however: planet Earth is a rock surrounded by a thin band of atmosphere that enables life as we know it; and it is hurtling through space, circling the sun. Viruses do not know borders, boundaries, political beliefs, colors of people, religions,  beliefs,  genders, body types, or ages. Viruses travel, and this virus will slowly circle hitching rides whenever it can on human beings, and it will soon eventually be... everywhere. It is not a question of IF. It's a question of WHEN. Everyone is tracking the virus's progress. But no one is talking about how interconnected we are.... If only folks would look at the climate emergency the same way."

It would not surprise me if Pence turns out to be the fall guy, Trump taps Nikki Haley for VP but after this debacle she politely declines and who knows who he winds up with. Lastly, Trump popularity rose because of the economy and the stock market but he’s going down for the same reason. What goes around comes around."

But even without this woman’s complaint, the lack of urgency and preparedness that we see from Trump and his enablers is truly appalling. Virtually every other major country is testing hundreds if not thousands of its citizens who’ve been exposed to the virus and we dont even have enough accurate test kits to do more than 500??  Where are the instructions to our citizens in basic virus prevention, in being told to self-quarantine if returning form South Korea or northern Italy etc etc and why in God’s name does anyone think it’s a good idea to have that disgusting toady Mike Pence be in charge of the messaging on this serious national issue, particularly after so many died in Indiana because of his basic and moral incompetence. 
I hope members of Congress from both parties speak out early and often if they are concerned about the administration’s handling of the virus and it’s effects. It’s way, way beyond the time to pretend that the emperor is wearing clothes."
2020-02-28 1:45,"Dereliction of duty has life-and-death consequences. Donald Trump and his cadre of anti-science, untrained, and frankly incompetent loyalists like the former pharmaceutical industry lobbyist who now heads Health and Human Services, Alex Azar, and Vice President Mike Pence ,who totally mismanaged the HIV epidemic in Indiana when he was governor, are unqualified to handle the looming coronavirus epidemic and may already have caused by their ignorance the virus to be unleashed in California and Texas when they left health care workers totally unprotected as they handled Americans returning from Wuhan, China, the epicenter of the virus, and the Diamond Princess where 14 Americans had contracted the coronavirus. Their mission seems to be to control the information rather than the spread of the virus. They must be held accountable for any who die on their watch."
2020-02-28 1:34,"we should also note the administrations response to this massive blunder... retaliate against the whistleblower. is this really an indication of how little trumps people feel about the people they are supposed to be protecting? is protecting trumps' image and ego more important than the lives of our health care workers, first responders?"
2020-02-28 1:35,"Trump disbanded the pandemic response team, fired experts and dramatically cut funding for the CDC. It is not surprising that training was not adequate and equipment was lacking. People can't blame these people on the front line dealing with the epidemic, the higher ups are responsible. In the corporate world, when a big mistake occurs, the CEO gets fired because they need to be held accountable. If Trump wants to run this country like a business, they he needs to step down. Or we must act as the Board of Directors to vote him out."
2020-02-28 1:39,"The health workers were not trained, were not given protective clothing, were not told to take their own temperatures three times a day, and then were allowed to leave the military base and go into the general public.
Where did they go? Out to a restaurant or fast food place? To a big box store? Did they take taxis or gig rides to the airport? These unprotected workers probably came in contact with dozens, if not hundreds, of people."
2020-02-28 1:45,"So our response to actual coronavirus patients has been to:

- Fly them on a very long airplane flight with people who weren't already sick

- Move them to military bases that are within a few miles of huge populations of people and many global travelers

- Send in response workers without protective gear and then allow them to travel freely among their communities

- All the while not even bothering to stock up on coronavirus detection kits or make any sort of preparations for an outbreak

The incomplete and negligence here is off the charts. Sadly, I do not think they will be able to contain this now. While prevention measures are under way, we also need to plan for the entire population to become infected, and how to manage their care."
2020-02-28 1:20,"I honestly tried to watch Trump's press conference last night with an open mind. As a school psychologist who works in a school district where keeping a kid with a cold/cough home from school is a luxury most parents can't afford, I really wanted to be reassured that our government is equipped to handle a national health crisis.
The only good thing I could say about Trump's responses was that he didn't slur his words for a change. I also heard some useful information about progress on developing a vaccine and various other treatments, but that didn't come from Trump. 
Other than that, there was a lot of confused statements and misleading information. Trump tried to blame the stock market's recent performance on the Democratic candidates, called Nancy Pelosi incompetent, gloated about his approval ratings, mocked Chuck Schumer and mimicked his NY accent, kept downplaying the seriousness of COVID-19 by comparing it to the flu, rambled on about how frequently he washes his hands, lied about the mortality rate and disputed the 2% figure, claimed (without evidence) that his travel restrictions have successfully stopped the virus from spreading to the U.S., whined about being called a racist, and could not give a coherent reason for appointing Mike Pence to coordinate his administration's response to this. 
I am not reassured. Not in the least."

As a registered nurse of many years, as a woman who has case managed ICU’s in the largest hospital in our state, as a community council member of our local healthcare facility, as a healthcare provider who has partnered with great numbers of other providers, believe me - Donald Trump, nor Mike Pence have a clue what they are doing.  

Today, how many days after the coronavirus has had a global impact, and national impact, Mike Pence has brought in a medically trained and experienced provider to serve our country, Dr. Deborah Birx.  Finally someone experienced and by the way, originally appointed years before by President Barack Obama.

There is no excuse for this blunder that has occurred in transporting or caring for patients or those potentially affected by the coronavirus, either in transportation or in the work that has been necessary.

Human lives are at stake.  This is the United States of America.  There is no way that one single person in this country should doubt healthcare either in acute or chronic status.  No one should be slighted in this highly educated country.

But left in the hands of an inept, reckless, careless leader, our president, we are doomed.  There is no cure for stupidity. And this is a prime example.  Any healthcare facility would fire immediately anyone so dangerous to society. 

For shame!"

Homeland security has been bungled by Trump appointees without crucial knowledge or experience after real experts were purged over the past 2 years. Trump mouths crazy nonsense, including blaming the Market crash on the Democratic debate...trivializing a looming pandemic & muzzling the CDC. Spin doctor propaganda is a travesty when America could have been #1 in sound public health. Instead, Trumps petty bluster is Making America Infected Now."

Under the Trump Administration we have people interacting with those infected by the Coronavirus without following any proper protocols or wearing any protective gear. It means many of them became infected. They then reentered the general population by going home, or staying in hotels, or flying on crowded commercial flights, or all of the above. 

It is mind-bending. The people the Trump administration tasked with supposedly controlling this pandemic are the ones spreading it. This is what comes of have a total incompetent, who does not even believe in science, elected president.

We were always going to have to face a threat like this at some point. It couldn't come at a worse time. 

Despite all Trump/GOP lies the Coronavirus proves Leadership Matters, Good Government Matters, Institutions Matter, and Competence Matters. 

As if we didn't already know it, each day brings new revelations on how Trump and the GOP are utterly incapable of dealing with any health crisis, let alone one of this magnitude. They hate science and defunded our health protections, so they can't possibly deal with this pandemic.

The over-the-top China-bashing that the media has indulged in both speaks to a lack of real confidence in our system(otherwise no need to bash because our superiority would be self evident.

As in: It wouldn't happen that way with us, we know what we are doing, we are the best anywhere! And we have freedom, democracy, transparent government and that magic cure-all, capitalism! Except, oops, we bungled the test kits. Oops, we didn't really know what to do with the positive Princess passengers. Oops, how do we protect the uninfected in the plane cabin, err, anybody have some plastic sheeting and duct tape...hmmm it doesn't reach all the way across. Nah, no need to test that weirdly ill California patient who never went to China. And now Pence has to approve what our scientists say?

There are numerous medical and scientific papers authored by medical teams in China on lessons learned about treatment regimens, protective gear requirements  and prevention of the spread of the Corona virus available on the web and published—written in English.  Subsequent to the early infections of Chinese health care workers treating coronavirus patients one only has to observe the protective gear that medical workers now employ in China.   We don’t need to repeat the early lessons from Wuhan, they have publish early findings.  New cases outside of China exceeded new cases in China for the first time today.    More magical thinking by team trump."
2020-02-28 2:54,The lack of quality and control doesn't surprise me at all.  This is typical govt in action.  It doesn't matter if it's a democrat or republican president.  Govt is just so inefficient at everything they lay their hands on.  The VA is a case in point in regards to healthcare.
2020-02-28 3:05,"Instead of thinking of the citizens of our country, Trump has put in charge of this enormously vital effort someone who will not challenge him and has an unhealthy disregard for the scientific community and its importance in keeping us safe and developing vaccines.

We deserve so much better.

Americans would do well to look to their states to take the lead to keep us safe.

This Coronavirus might very well turn out to be Katrina for Trump.

I pray and hope for wise governance for all.. Trump is incapable of providing it on a national level.

He says when warmer weather arrives, the danger will pass.  Oh really?  I had no idea during his military bone spur deferment he actually was enrolled in medical school.

Is that one of his, ""I was told"" cop out lies?"

And they’re all  currently out there, meeting with voters, etc. But what happens in an election year if attending rallies becomes too risky?  If a community is hit by the virus and people are urged to limit public exposure ? There are  currently no medications which effectively destroy this virus and treatment seems to be focused on keeping  patients comfortable while  taking a wait and see approach.  

Could be quire an election year. Please don’t respond with wishes that any of the above individuals gets sick. I wouldn’t wish this virus on anyone."

He has decided with Rush Limbaugh that this health crisis is just some kind of political dirty trick designed to ""bring him down."" He doesn't seem to notice that thousands of people are dying all over the planet. He doesn't seem to  be listening to hundreds of health care professionals saying with utmost non-partisan alarm at the unpreparedness of his administration for this  crisis.

The whistleblower should be congratulated for her courage, not hounded and threatened with termination. The administration needs to immediately to buy, then manufacture  medical kits to quickly  test for suspected viral exposure. This is an emergency. The spokesmen  for the CDC  in this crisis should be the medical experts not VP Pence to insure that the truth and medical facts spoken are believable. Pence is a political partisan whose messages in this crisis  are likely to be viewed as politicized propaganda and with good reason given his longstanding sycophantic behavior."

The Trump administration's attempt to cover up its own incompetence and silence whistleblowers will only hamper the response to the coronavirus, and will aid in its spread. No political appointee in the Trump administration can be trusted to tell the truth.

My personal indicator: we will know the virus is a serious threat the day Trump disappears from public view. He is a germophobe, and will isolate himself if he thinks he might face some risk."
2020-02-28 3:47,"What will have to happen for Trump to admit there is a serious problem?  I assume he will never admit that he or his administration have bungled things so far.  Still, there must be some  event that will convince him that he has more important duties than trashing the Roger Stone jurors."

The nation will get a taste of no government since Republicans have demolished the government's infrastructure, underfunded, understaffed, lacking necessary equipment and training.

The coronavirus is a serious issue and it needs to be dealt with in a serious way. If the administration is found to be lacking in their handling of it, they need to accept  responsibility and steep aside.  Your life and mine, my family's lives and yours are all on the line.

We don't need bureaucrats or political actors playing the role of doctors."
2020-02-28 0:44,"It’s the incompetence, stupid.  That will be the epitaph for Donald’s presidency.  I read today that Tony Fauci, a veteran of the AIDS epidemic, one of the foremost scientists serving in government, with expertise in viruses, will now have to have Reverend Pence clear his public statements.  Positively ridiculous.  This administration has zero credibility on any subject.  Lies, lies, lies, lies.  No lie is too big, no lie is too little.  But they are muzzling the experts, calling the shots.  Who needs experts?

A certain reality show star who doesn’t believe in science and knows more about  every topic known to man than all experts in any subject on the planet is really proving each and every day that putting a moron in charge is risky business.   There is sort of a delightful irony in a virus threatening to topple the germaphobe’s presidency."
2020-02-28 4:58,"I'm not sure Americans fully appreciate just how badly managed the COVID-19 response has been in the US. (And health care planners cannot be blamed for this. It's the result of the GOP gutting public health agencies, eliminating preparedness teams, and dismissing expertise.) 

Compare this horrific story with the quarantines of successive repatriation flights from Wuhan and then the Diamond Princess at military bases in Ontario. Because Ontario (and all of Canada) has sophisticated protocols in place, the bases were prepared days in advance of the arrival of the flights. Emergency Medical Assistance Teams were on-site. Extensive coordination took place with local public health units and hospitals. Thus far, no one has tested positive from these flights, and the first passengers have gone home. It all went off without a hitch.

Some passengers elected not to take the repatriation flights. They were met at the airport and placed under quarantine by order.

The one major challenge seems to be the distribution of personal protective equipment across the country, particularly for front line health care workers.

And last but not least - of course the test is free. As will be any vaccine that is developed."
2020-02-28 6:23,"Health insurance, including single-payer universal insurance, is of no use if there are no doctors available, and no candidate, let alone Trump, is talking about that reality, which exists in many parts of our country.

For instance, an article in the Albuquerque Journal awhile back noted that the largest health care system in New Mexico did not have a single primary care doctor accepting new patients. Lest you on the coasts simply dismiss this as the price one pays for living in flyover America, I would note the same article stated that in Massachusetts, with the highest doctor to population ration, the average wait for  a patient to see a new primary care doctor was fifty-seven days.

For those who think free medical school would solve the problem, I would note that most doctors (and most readers, I would bet), when starting out, want to go to a place that they view as cosmopolitan, safe, and with good schools for their kids, not rural and poor urban communities. 

Again, no candidate is talking about this, making universal insurance a largely empty promise even if fulfilled."
2020-02-28 6:41,"many experts seem to suggest that more thorough testing would reveal more cases.  unfortunately the news media is NOT asking the logical follow-up questions:
- does that mean that americans may be dying as a result of being infected by covid-19, with the cause of death being labelled as flu,  pneumonia or something else?
- have health professionals been trained to recognize the difference?
- how many such cases might there be?  would it help to identify these cases posthumously for the purpose of slowing the spread of covid-19?"
2020-02-28 4:32,"All entities engaged in activities involving public health and safety should have in place ""corrective action  programs."" In some industries it's been mandated for years. All employees and contractors are participants; any individual can enter their observation or experience regarding off-normal events or conditions in a formal reporting system. The objective beyond identification is to fix the immediate problem and act to prevent recurrence. Typically, within 24 hours of identification a management team reviews  all items newly identified, assigns a manager lead to mobilize, fix and prevent, and periodically report back. Whistle-blower  programs may kick in when all else fails.  You reported ealth-related work was and isn't  sufficiently grounded in formal  procedures and training, and no formal corrective action program exists. Humans make mistakes  and it's unnatural to admit mistakes. If such programs exist and were unknowingly or willfully violated such conduct may be punishable. Unfortunately, too much of the leadership of the Article II branch  is not suitably motivated to execute their duties in accordance with our expectations."
2020-02-28 7:56,"It is almost like there is a concerted effort to allow this into thepopulation. This is just incredible.  How about some further investigative reporting to discover the names of those on the team sent in without proper protective equipment according to the whistleblower. Surely those names could be had and interviews could be carried out. This non testing approach by the CDC, this limited testing by Fedex by the CDC, all flies in the face of what is known about Covid-19 so far, that it appears to be contagious when no symptoms are present. And now the development, quite predictable, that this Administration will serve their own interests over everyone else, including requiring what professionals are left that didn't get cut with the 2018 slashing of departments and budgets, will not be allowed to make public statements directly to the public but have to be approved first by this corrupt White House. God help all of us."
2020-02-28 5:19,"The Trump administration made the loudest criticisms of the Chinese government officials trying to cover up the epidemic and reprimand the whistle-blowers, but use the same playbook when it is their turn.  Is there any credibility or moral authority left in this government ?"
2020-02-28 7:19,"Recent reports from the San Francisco Chronicle indicate that the infected California woman initially showed up at the VacaValley hospital in Vacaville California. 

Vacaville is not a tourist destination. I have occasionally stopped there when driving back from Tahoe but it is not likely that the source of the infection was a Chinese tourist. 

However, Vacaville is a few miles north of the quarantine site at Travis Air Force Base. Almost certainly, that is the source of the infection. I think that is good news, because in my opinion it points to a small cluster of infections which should be containable. Somebody was careless at the quarantine site and they infected a few people in Vacaville one of whom is now seriously ill. 

The authorities are denying any connection to Travis, but that is only to be expected. This is an embarrassment for US health authorities."

For whatever reason, the Administration decided that the Department of Health and Human Services would be in charge and in the other case, the, the military would.  They have not been trained for this kind of job, I feel bad for the people involved.  What was the Administration thinking?  Oh, I forgot, thinking is not their long suit."

2020-02-28 4:57,"My question is, why were actual Dr.s not wearing protective gear while dealing with the evacuees? The whistleblower said that CDC people were wearing hazmat suits, and the Dr.s were just wearing regular clothes. Why? If anyone should know better, they should."
2020-02-28 5:05,"It's clear that the administration has put Mike Pence in charge of messaging not so he can serve the public by speaking with one cogent, authoritative voice, but say whatever helps keep up appearances, regardless of the consequences.

But he has been dismantling the important measures Obama took to counter the Ebola infection crisis that worked very effectively in protecting the nation. And as with all things Obama, trump did this vengefully, recklessly and surreptitiously and the nation may well pay a huge price for it now with the looming emergence of a similar infection crisis, the Coronavirus outbreak."

2020-02-28 10:23,"Too much silliness about all of it.  The disease will spread, exactly how people or pets is not entirely known.  Many people will be silent carriers.  And as this is a virus having a mild case will confer immunity.  The elderly who have had their pneumonia vaccines may be less like to have a severe case.... death is usually from pneumonia or other respiratory problems.  I do NOT understand why the CDC is not putting out a recommendation for pneumonia shots amongst the immunologically compromised.  To the degree , that in younger people, the virus may cascade-- develop very rapidly as did the 1917 flu,  that has not been reported as an issue.  When we understand a bit more about how the disease progresses, we will be able to marginally treat people better.  Quarantine sounds good... is it really helpful?  More questions than answers at this point.  Wash your hands, keep them away from your face, wear gloves in public places.  Wipe down computer keyboards and mice and door knobs... and don't drink too much alcohol which weakens your immune system.  Chicken soup -- homemade -- chicken or bones in a pot with water and salt.. veggies as desired. (anti-bacterial in fact)… Do not panic."
2020-02-28 4:24,"The arrogance and foolishness of any bureaucrat or medical personnel interacting with a potentially infected person is stunning. We can only be thankful that so far this appears to be a mild virus. But then the arena for this virus to explore is enormous. And while it plays it could decide to mutate and that is when we will really, really have a problem. We have already surpassed the number of SARS (27) and MERS (2) cases in the USA. Our President has hobbled the scientific thinking within the government and now has VP Pence who has absolutely no experience to manage this pandemic. Yes, he 'managed' exactly a single case of MERS in Indiana in a medical worker who had contracted it in Saudi Arabia, the other case happened to be in Florida. I suggest that all folks might want to start thinking for themselves, keep clean and use common sense. No real point in believing in this present governments approach towards keeping us safe."

2020-02-28 10:05,"There is a NYT story right now about the outbreak in Iran. An accompanying photo shows a healthcare worker bedside in an actual Coronavirus ward wearing just a soft face mask, not even a respirator. And if that’s not bad enough he had a beard, which anyone with respirator experience will tell you immediately renders any mask or respirator worthless because of air leakage it allows around the edges. Odds are, this man and many of his coworkers and their families are already infected. I was horrified at the medical incompetence shown in just that one photo. We’re past containment. Now it’s just a matter of practicing good individual hygiene, and if you do get infected hoping you’re in the 98%."
2020-02-28 8:57,"The vast majority of Americans have no familiarity with how the Politburo operated. But if you have watched the justly acclaimed HBO series on the 1986 Chernobyl nuclear calamity, then you have a good understanding of the Politburo's approach to crisis -- even in the time of reformist Gorbachev.

What you are witnessing in the Trump side's clampdown on the truth in the context of the Covid-19 emergency, up to & including the co-opting of key US epidemiologists at the CDC, is classic Politburo methodology.

It is the same methodology that Putin, whose career began with complete loyalty to the Politburo (as Russian-speakers would say, ""encompassing even innards & giblets""), incorporated into his own tyrannical reign, as the primary qualification for salaried employment in the government.

As Americans can readily appreciate now that it imperils our own health & livelihood, this toxic approach of suppressing the truth did not help mitigate the Chernobyl disaster, increased its lethality & long-term impacts & actually set the entire system that adhered to this approach on a downward spiral that within just a few years led to its complete implosion.

Putin's system is not providing even the basics of health security or economic security for 90+% of its taxpayers & households. There are plenty of experts including Khodorkovsky, Kasparov, Roizman & Navalny who daily confirm the failure of this outdated approach rooted in Deceit & data suppression.

It won't work in the USA either."
2020-02-28 4:21,If any healthcare workers get infected as a result of inadequate equipment or training then the Public officials responsible should be jailed.

2020-02-28 10:50,"I can see no way in which the virus won't spread quickly world wide.

Take my country, we played against Italy in Rome on Sat'22nd (6 Nations Rugby).

The majority of fans travelled from all parts of Scotland & Italy, with some coming from wider afield. To what extent that will have promoted the spread of the virus remains to be seen.

Most readers will have anecdotal accounts of their own.

The UK Government has said there's no need to panic, the NHS can cope. That's not what doctors & nurses say. In some parts of the country hospitals have made preparations to activate the ""Three Wise Men Protocol"". Three senior consultants in each hospital will decide who is to be given treatment & who is not; the weakest will be denied treatment to ease the pressure on hospital beds.

I only know in the broadest terms how healthcare works in America. I do know, mostly from reading the NYT, how your Government has cut away the very things which would be most suited to managing the problems this virus poses.

I don't believe my Government's soothing words/lies. I see from your comments that you don't believe yours.

However, I do hope that Trump’s fan club finally sees that this man is unqualified to lead us in times of crisis.    Over and over, we see that everything is about HIM.  His re-election, his image, his superiority.  He doesn’t have empathy.  Why would he care that people might die on his watch?

Pence declared you must go through him if you are a government official to release info.    Pence is worried the info will cause the stock market to drop.

If true it represents a gigantic failure on the part of our entire government including those governmental agencies in whom we have placed enormous trust, specifically the CDC and National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Diseases. The Administration, the Congress and the Media share in the blame. I have been writing comments for six weeks or so (whenever the outbreak began) that this reminded me of Nero fiddling while Rome burned: the nation (all of the above) has been consumed by politics; impeachment, caucuses and primaries, Epstein while a pandemic loomed. As a physician I find it incredible that the most basic infection control techniques, known in every community hospital were not followed IF this is true. The decision to take Americans back, known to be infected, was a grave one and those who made that decision surely presumed our officials, paraded by the President at his hastily arranged presser, were warning the bases they would be sent to to brush up on basics. The Congress, as well, consumed by politics, abdicated it's role in oversight -both Houses.

Without them we'd be more in the dark and thus more endangered.

Do not depend on trump or pence and Azar. These guys are ignorant and know they all have a leg up for protection. 
Our American wage earners , children and seniors and disabled are being hurt by this evolving viral attack and are without protections and clear instructions. 
Our entire communities of department heads and workers in government must create emerg. Plans to keep offices open for services. 
Quarantines must be implemented in a safe humane way for those requiring observation. 
Information like the data Dr. Fauci is not able to share because of a gag order by trumpworld can be gotten from other virology experts in our own states. Utilize your medical community. Meetings should be occurring NOW. Local hospitals should be coordinating with physicians and nurses in each community to make “ at home visits” to the sick and well in quarantine. 
Schools and daycares must be shuttered now to have any benefit of stopping exposure to COVID19. Lab workers must be trained to obtain blood samples for specific testing.

The president made devastating cuts to our medical infrastructure and preparedness to fight disease as part of his efforts to gut government, cut taxes and hand the windfall  back to his rich cronies.
As part this administration’s ham handed efforts, HHS “officials” came into direct contact with 13 individuals infected with the Coronavirus and herded them onto a plane full of healthy passengers without adequate protective gear for themselves or anyone else concerned. Then these officials were permitted to re-enter the general population without even being tested.
The president appeared on television deliberately spreading disinformation and lies to make himself look better and putting the population at greater risk.
The president has shut down public health officials and forbidden them from passing on relevant health information that might help the general public. 
We don’t have nearly the amount of text kits we need (a state the size of California only has 200) and a vaccine is a long way off. 
That’s the situation and it is extremely serious. America is looking more like a banana republic every single day.  We are getting a preview of what it feels like living in a failed state run by a deranged despot dictator. #MAGA2020?"

Even I know this, even though I’m a dog-and-cat vet living in a city. So why are *doctors from the CDC*, of all places, unaware that it’s not okay to walk into a quarantine area wearing street clothes like suits?  Maybe the USDA should start training them too. SMH"
2020-02-28 13:41,"I would be willing to bet that we, the CDC, or other such organizations, likely know who these people are that may have been exposed to coronavirus that were reported to the Democrats by this whistleblower. It seems that our Federal Government should track down these people and bring them to a secure medical facility and test them all immediately and quarantine them for two weeks regardless of the outcome of the tests. Like the beginning of any new situation there is a learning curve. It seems that it is a short curve in this instance and it appears what we have here is simply another attempt to stoke fear and encourage chaos by people who have some sort of political agenda. Rumor's and propaganda 
the likes of which we have never seen are rampant and are causing significant harm and instilling fear in this country. If only the Democrats did not hate Trump and wish to harm him at all cots things would be better by far. However, in spite of what the Democrats are trying to do President Trump is undeterred in his efforts to protect America and Americans as best as humanly possible to do."

It was why the Impeachment took place and Trump was impeached.  It is now taking another Whistleblower to tell the truth about what is truly happening in the Trump administration to shine a light on what is really happening in HHS.

Now if only one Whistleblower from theIRS would release the tax returns of Trump, we may have enough for the Senate to realize the errors of their ways and Throw out Trump.

I hope Nancy Pelosi changes her mind and adds additional charges against Trump.  

Just when you think it cannot get any worse, it does."
2020-02-28 13:12,"For the Trump Administration, incompetence is not a bug, but a feature.

Incompetence causes chaos. Chaos offers opportunities to steal and to rewrite the rules while we everyone is distracted. 

Look at the Iraq War (which the Republicans pretend they had nothing to do with now.) If Bush wanted that war to go smoothly, he would have put Colin Powell in charge and sent enough to troops to keep order in the vacuum created by the end of Saddam regime. Instead he put Rumsfeld in charge. The chaos that he caused went on for decades, and in the chaos pallets of hundred dollar bills disappeared, Haliburton and other contractors made billions doing shoddy work, and the Iraqi Constitution was rewritten to give control of Iraq's oil to global corporations. The whole thing makes a lot more sense if you look at it in reverse.

Haliburton also profited from Hurricane Katrina. Pence was a leader of a commission that used it as an excuse to remake New Orleans in the image of extreme disaster capitalism, closing all the public schools, closing housing projects, making it impossible for many or monirities to return to their homes, etc.

Trump is obviously not preoccupied with saving lives. He is preoccupied with blaming others, while he uses incompetence to create chaos, just like he does every day 

The Right will use a pandemic to rewrite the Constitution while everyone is trying to survive, 

Stop assuming the Right is interested in morality or governing, against the evidence."

Consistantly compromising our Nation's security, intelligence communities, financial, and citizens healthcare needs is a recipe for disaster waiting to happen. I suspect when this comes to pass, Trump and his Republican minions will blame everyone else but themselves. ""The buck stops here"" motto only applies to the bucks that ends up in their pockets, not in taking responsibility for giving unqualified people positions because of their loyalty to Trump or political party... smh..."
2020-02-28 13:29,"We have a deeper problem in America than Coronavirus and it’s called a Narcissistic Personality Disorder. And all one needs to do is go to Google and search “DSM IV Narcissistic Personality Disorder” to look it up and they will see how deadly serious this affliction is to our nation. Why? Because our President has an extreme case of it. 

This disorder makes Trump incapable of witnessing any event, any discussion, anyone’s public comments or even a potential pandemic without interpreting it through a lens of how it impacts him personally. The affliction also prohibits Trump from feeling empathy towards anyone or receiving advice— even from experienced intelligence, military  or health official. We witness such behavior everyday. Now it may lead to people dying because the president is determined to hide the potential impact of the disease because he thinks it may hurt the economy and endanger his re-election chances. 

As a nation we need to address the president’s severe case of Narcissistic Personality Disorder before it is too late. He’s making decisions that put lives in danger and we can no longer afford to treat him like a maverick or misguided CEO. We need to show compassion and empathy to him-two things that a person with his disorder is incapable of doing. As his staff and people closest to him are not willing to step up, its time others did. His disorder is more dangerous to America than Coronavirus— and now they are connected. It needs to be publicly discussed."
2020-02-28 14:25,"Is Pence tracking down these workers? If not, why not? When will test kits be made more widely available? California has 8400 people under observation but only 440 people have been tested nationwide. Pence should be activating every possible method to protect the public. He’s only focused on providing cover for Trump. This is an outright disaster."

A deadly pandemic will happen, it is a question of when. I remember teaching a microbiology class and talking about this reality back in the mid 1990s, 25 years ago! This was before Sept. 11, 2001. Now COVID-19 is in the community and asymptomatic children and adults are spreading it. Our only hope is to invest resources to develop vaccines faster, because obviously  the people of this country will not contain an infectious threat using their intelligence, will, and selfless dedication to the greater good."

""testing was not done because none of the personnel showed symptoms of being sick."" Huh? All of the experts I have heard comment have emphasized that widespread testing, and not merely monitoring for symptoms, is essential to controlling the spread of the virus. According to one member of Congress, the CDC is actively impeding testing. 

It's been reported that infected individuals may transmit the virus before they show symptoms. Question: Are the aforementioned personnel circulating in the general population?"

US  is just starting the Coronavirus crisis. We will see how our  Government  White House and  Congress  will handle the contagion and  sustaining daily life. Just  1 month later  we will see what we are all about, a hype or  we can pull our  weight .

Incorrect masks, failure to change gloves or wear protective clothing is all part of this training. The biggest contamination threat - phones. I see workers in every setting - hospitals, doctors offices, stores, and postal and delivery services,  on their phones. Phones and their cases are never decontaminated!

He was calm and measured and talked about the coordination with the CDC in responding to the anticipated spread of the virus in California. Then he turned the discussion over to the experts who talked about the fact that we had been through this before with SARS and EBOLA and had established protocols during those health scares that they were refining and building on. I guess that’s the “deep state”-people who have learned through history and are able to use that knowledge in new situations. I, for one, am grateful that we have that here in California.

Trump is so ignorant that he doesn't know what he doesn't know. He has become so enthralled with the role he has been play-acting for the past 3 years that he actually thinks he knows what he is doing. He appoints Mike Pence, his chief  epidemiologist, as ""Czar"" to oversee his government's response to a potential coronavirus epidemic. The example of the blind (and ignorant) appointing the blind and ignorant. Now the ""emperor"" aka Donald J Trump"" will be seen, maybe even by his adoring base, as the fraud he has always been. Many will die and be harmed by the hubristic ignorance of the current CEO in the White House.

No president on the day of his inauguration was ever completely prepared for the job. But they all learned on the job and appointed knowledgeable surrogates to help them. Only Trump has remained willfully ignorant and too self-absorbed to actually appoint experts to help him as CEO. All he cares about is personal ""loyalty"", not competence. Perhaps these untrained government workers who were sent to help with the quarantine of Americans exposed to the virus overseas may, through ignorance of how viruses spread, have already infected others around the nation. Just another example of the Trump administration making America Great Again."

Q Looking into it? Do you have a message on that?
THE PRESIDENT: If you tell me that’s happening, we will definitely investigate. We don’t want that.

You can't buy masks at any retailer or reputable online store, there is a month+ backorder at Amazon, and there's not even widespread outbreaks yet.  

Trump has no clue.  He was surprised to find out the annual fatalities from seasonal flu.  He is out-loud imagining a miracle to intercede.  The scientists have to clear public comments with science-hostile Mike Pence.

2020-02-28 13:55,More proof of the total ineptness of this administration.  Money isn't everything!  The economy isn't everything.  They simply do NOT have the ability to protect American's lives.  Time to change administrations and bring back some brain power
2020-02-28 14:22,"No surprise that California the Anti-Trump state is the location of poorly prepared  LOCAL communities preparedness for Coronavirus. About Narcissism of Trump:Donald Trump like many or most political leaders is narcissistic. The reader should know however, that narcissism is not a psychiatric curse word. The psychoanalytic term for the complex domain of self-love and dignity is narcissism, or the narcissistic sector of our personality. It is important to note that narcissism is not necessarily a synonym for selfishness or self-absorption. In a normal personality, self-love matures and develops through anxieties and challenges, just as the ability to love others also has the opportunity to grow and mature. As the Bible clearly indicates, healthy self-love is necessary for love of others.
Jesus replied: “Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind.’ This is the first and greatest commandment. And the second is like it: ‘Love your neighbor as yourself.” (Matthew 22: 37-39. NIV)."
2020-02-28 8:45,"Has anyone questioned why  California is being hit so hard by all this?  Trump hates California, it’s politicians (with the exception of Nunes) and it’s people (many Latinos).  Just saying."
2020-02-28 10:09,"No talking about rising temperatures, global warming, climate change. Spreading fevers?"
2020-02-28 12:50,"Well here we are, facing a worst-nightmare scenario: A national health threat that will, at the least, require the keenest science and public health minds an resources to fight. And who’s in the big office?  The most corrupt, science-averse, organizationally inept president in the nation’s history doing -exactly- what you’d expect; bragging, lying, appointing inept expendable political sycophants to the front lines, and dropping the curtains. 

The next time you cast a vote for president (if you’re lucky enough to survive this one’s reign) please THINK REAL HARD. Votes can kill."

2020-02-28 13:57,"Our supreme leader ( not  Khamenei, Glorious) Trump  assured us not to believe fake media , when spring warm hits  , corona virus  dies out. 

Stop whining."
2020-02-28 14:06,This is criminal. Lock Trump up. Lock Pence up.
2020-02-28 14:20,"This has been corrected, right?? 
I am glad that doesn't get decided by the democratic process judging from the left field comments in this section.."
2020-02-28 14:46,"There seems to be some confusion in D.C. that this is COVID-19, not COVFEFE"
2020-02-28 14:55,"I bet even the Trump supporting farmers are waking up...

They KNOW how fast a virus or bacterial infection can spread through a herd of cattle or flocks of chickens or yards full of pigs.

They act quickly to vaccinate them, most having the vaccines on hand so they don't even have to wait for a vet visit...

People in herds (crowds) are just as likely to spread diseases.

OK farmers...your gibberish speaking President has spoken.


Would you manage your herds like this? Fingers crossed and prayer?

Are you waking up yet?"
2020-02-28 13:49,"Thank You HHS!  Cannot believe our own government enabled this  spread of this Virus into the community!  My initial thought of:  Of course  President Trump is sending all citizens possibly infected with Covid-19 to California!  He is politically at war with California.  If it spreads, what better place to have an outbreak than California!  This is utterly unbelievable right now.  Makes me nauseas."
2020-02-28 14:56,Thank goodness for whistle blowers. Why doesn't the times do an in-depth story on how Trump has dismantled or weakened important government agencies like the CDC?
2020-02-28 14:58,Millennials and younger generations have the sad responsibility of learning from this Trump administration and Republican bungle.  Let's hope one of their lessons is that there is actual physical danger from tax cuts for the rich which rob our government of the resources needed to protect us all.  This level of negligence and incompetence should be scrutinized through public hearings.
2020-02-28 15:18,"I just want to send a sincere thank you to the brave whistle blower for coming forward.  

I shudder to think or imagine how much worse this scenario could have played out with that individual stepping up and thinking about what's in the best interest of all Americans rather than the president who can't ever seem to get past his own imagine, voice and ego."
2020-02-28 14:57,So instead of blocking this virus from entering the country they facilitate its import and spreading coast to coast? A bioterrorist or hostile foreign agent can't do a better job than this!
2020-02-28 15:01,"Uh oh, republicans! This whistle blower is the real threat, just like before, is that right? I certainly hope not, but I would not be surprised to hear trump say that all citizen reports have to go through him or Pence first.

Beware; trumpies have already defended this administration in their hounding of people who talk. Look what they're doing right now to a member of the Roger Stone jury and the judge! How they trashed Lt. Col. Vindman and Ambassador Yovanovich! If trump cult members don't care that trump dishonors other Americans just for fun, you know his ego will search for cover, not truth.

Don't continue down the rabbit hole, where you feel you have to defend every silly lie! Viruses don't know ideology. When trump says that the danger is personally political, when it's actually a health danger, you know you need to correct your party. 

Right? Right, trumpies? You wouldn't actually support an investigation into how Joe Biden caused coronavirus to make trump look bad, crash the stock market on purpose and kill all republicans, would you? Cuz that's how cray cray this president is gonna get. He ALREADY IS, what with his agreement with Limbaugh that the Dems are once again nefarious deep staters.

Tell us you'll draw a line somewhere, trumpies."
2020-02-28 15:01,"Tracking the incompetence of the US response is more challenging than fettering out super-spreaders. It's like Trump is a super-spreader of incompetence. Every day, another mentally ill decision."
2020-02-28 15:05,"Ask Pence, maybe we can pray it away."
2020-02-28 15:27,"Didn't take long for the virus to be politicized, LOL."
2020-02-28 15:07,"In 2016 we elected a person totally unfit for the job. He is still totally unfit for the job.  But now for the first time, his incompetence is harming the public at a growing rate. He will never admit his incompetence, but this time he can't cover it up and get away with it. As always, he tries to play president and believes he is a genius and a ruler above them all.  Incompetent, defensive and mistrusting people like Trump should never be allowed  to have so much power. He may kill us all with his ignorance, stubbornness and malevolent intents at coverups and vengeance."
2020-02-28 15:13,It's great to have an experienced virologist like Mike Pence in charge.
2020-02-28 14:59,"Surprise, surprise. Our president cut the very agencies needed to deal with this, and has continued to downplay the seriousness. His cruel policies are behind so many deaths."
2020-02-28 15:08,It's like people never heard of or seen a respiratory infection before.  Probably too distracted with their constant hacking coughs and congestion brought on from just breathing the air.  Cold and flu season comes to most offices and it's just even more of a competition to see who can be made to blink first and actually concede to taking a sick day.  Slackers.  Coronavirus will be like iron man competition for most American workplaces.
2020-02-28 15:20,"Elections have consequences.

Glad I did not vote for DJT.

No matter what happens I know I can look my children in the eyes now and into the future that I did my best to keep DJT from reaching the highest office in the land.



Not everyone can say that.

And putin laughs..."
2020-02-28 15:23,"All information now goes through Pence?

Time for more whistleblowers."
2020-02-28 14:58,"In the end, it only matters to this administration that they look good.
Of course, it's getting more and more difficult as they actually have to make decisions and enact policy.
People might actually be paying attention to what they're doing and the administrations biggest fear, being exposed as the fake, phony, frauds that they all are, will be realized.
But, as long as they keep repeating, ""the president is doing a great job"", they can hold onto their jobs."
2020-02-28 15:04,"Perhaps those in the continental U.S. like the woman now at UC Davis Medical Center, who have been diagnosed with this coronavirus but have had no ""known"" contact with other coronavirus potential carriers were infected by untrained U.S. government workers such as the ones described in this article.

Incompetence pervades the Trump administration and the incompetence begins at the top and flows downhill."
2020-02-28 15:05,"I notice that when asked to respond to Mr. Gomez’s direct questions, Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar gave responses that were not outright lies, but also never directly answered the questions.

When Mr. Gomez asked if any medical responders were “exposed to high risk evacuees”, Mr. Azar responded “they should never have been.” Not thot they hadn’t, but that they should have not have been.” That is like being at a car wreck and asking the injured driver if he or she were involved, and being answered “I should not have been.”

When Mr.Gomez asked about reports that the situation was chaotic, Mr. Azar responded that he could “not accept your proposal that it was chaotic at all times.” While not a lie, it conveys that there WERE times that wee chaotic which Mr. Azar wanted to downplay. This is like being at a mass shooting and being told later the site wasn’t chaotic at all times.

This is what happens when you have an administration that guts well trained professionals and experts from agencies and replaces them with adoring unqualified, incompetent, political hacks who ignore facts and peddle “alternate facts” as the now invisible Kelly Ann Conway calls them.

This is also reflects the appointment of VP Mike Pence to lead the effort to combat the virus’ spread in the US. What medical expertise does Pence have to qualify him for this critical role, other than to get on fake news stations like Fox and declare that he (and God) have everything under control?"
2020-02-28 15:06,"Because the United States of America does not have Universal Health Care, many Americans are not going to go to the doctor when they get symptoms of Coronavirus because they can't afford to go to the doctor."
2020-02-28 15:20,"HHS fumbled this.  

The head of DHS was crowd-sourcing, live on Twitter, how to get the outbreak map working on the web.

The President was surprised to her that masks were being hoarded and price-gouged.  

The president was surprised to hear that seasonal flu kills over 20K people each year.  

The experts have to vet every statement through VP who thinks science is not much more than a quaint affectation, and has a disastrous record on actual health care.  ""Indiana model"" my eye."
2020-02-28 15:01,"It sounds as though the US is taking the initial steps for which China has been so criticized. Deny, lie, minimize, retaliate. Otherwise this would not be a whistleblower issue with its attedant protections for speaking up about this public health crisis."
2020-02-28 15:19,"The only good that may come from the corona virus pandemic is that it may bring about Trump's downfall. 

The economy, the one thing that has kept many republicans loyal to Trump, is about to tank.

Trump’s systematic destruction of our national health agencies has left us unprepared to fight the spread of the virus, which means even staunch allies are now at risk. 

A belated and bungled response to the outbreak in the United States falls squarely on Trump's shoulders, and when his supporters are forced to cope with closed daycare centers, schools, and businesses, and find themselves unable to pay for treatment, even they may sour on voting for Trump.

If we can manage to survive for 9 more months,  we could actually elect a president who can turn things around."
2020-02-28 15:28,"This is exactly the type of obvious error that would be avoided if the situation was being managed by the well-trained CDC team previously established at CDC.  But the Administration eliminated that staff in 2018.  This is an obvious consequence of that foolish action.  An error like this might on it's own initiate a wide spread of Covid-19. 

Perhaps it's time to reconsider Secretary Azar's qualifications for his current position.  His background as a lobbyist and drug company executive now seems obviously insufficient for the tasks he's facing.  A person with deep qualifications in public health would be better suited.

Let's not forget that the President's preferences typically lead towards this sort of major error: a preference for loyalty over expertise, an unwillingness to accept expert input, and prioritization of military funding over public health.  If Covid-19 spreads widely within the country, we stand to lose move lives due to foolish refusals to fund public health than we have saved with recent military expenditures."
2020-02-28 15:29,This is so incompetent that it almost seems that they were trying to spread the virus.
2020-02-28 15:30,"We can thank Trump and his State department led by Mike pompeo for bringing these 300 passengers back to the US when they should have been quarantined. to compound the problem, innumerable healthcare workers on the front line have been exposed to a potentially deadly virus.

Way to go Mr Stable Genius!"
2020-02-28 15:41,"I have just come back from travel abroad. At two airports I was asked to consent to a quick, forehead temperate read as well as a single question about whether I had been in China in the last month, or had any friends relatives who may have. When I went through Newark International (along with arriving passengers from Rome, Berlin, London, Mumbai, etc) there were no equivalent measure. Even the Immigration Officer didn't bother to ask me a single question about my travels. NOT a good sign USA for us..."
2020-02-28 15:37,"Don't worry everyone, the first load of thoughts and prayers from Mike Pence has already arrived."
2020-02-28 15:41,"Meanwhile.....Trump is busy directing a video about the deep state while the country is in crisis. Is this what we pay him to do?


“One day after briefing the press in an attempt to calm nerves about the spread of the new coronavirus, President Donald Trump spent 45 minutes talking to the lead actors of a low-budget conservative play about the so-called Deep State.”

2020-02-28 16:01,"With the placement of incompetent Trumpian sycophants in every critical Homeland position - know-nothings appointed to temporary offices because of their TV personalities and sworn allegiance to Trump instead of this nation - we are totally unprepared for anything of consequence.

Under Obama, the possibilities of devastations like this were anticipated as soon as he took office, and he hired experts in strategic planning to deal with the potentialities. Trump hired ignorant sycophants, scripting OUR SAFETY like an inconsequential TV game show. 

This of you who support him are responsible for this negligence. Change it or bear the consequences. Unfortunately WE suffer too because of your lack of insight and gullibility."
2020-02-28 15:37,"Thought experiment: imagine your candidate of choice as president during the next outbreak. How would she or he handle things? 

Pete Buttigieg is my choice. He's intelligent and unflappable. Good qualities to have during a virus outbreak."
2020-02-28 15:39,I don’t think any other administration Republican or Democrat would need whistle-blowers to disperse needed public information  concerning such a crisis.
2020-02-28 15:57,"The straight lying even though there is photographic proof contradicting their claims is what scares me the most each time this administration pulls it off. The many photographs of the buses moving the quarantined around, with drivers in normal street clothing, without any protective gear on, flouts this claim from the first moment they were on US soil. Thankfully the whistle blower has stepped up, but let’s not imagine anything will come of their brave action. The claim will supposedly be “investigated” and that will be the end of it. Meanwhile, as that drags on, the personnel affected will continue to infect their communities."
2020-02-28 15:40,"Title should be""US health workers Lack Training and Protective gear"".
Hospital at which I work is starting to have shortage of masks and other protective gear ( we were warned about coming national shortage of many hospital supplies), we didn't have any briefing, training or official information from hospital management, including Infection Control. Only information about medical aspects of Covid-19 I personally have is from reading medical journals.I guess that approach in this institution is ""when infection comes here, we will deal with it""!"
2020-02-28 15:47,"So basically, the whistleblower identified unprotected health workers who helped the evacuees from Japan transfer from the jet plane,  are now spread out and possibly unknowingly spreading the coronavirus to anyone they meet, anyone they share an elevator with, a bathroom with, and, for a period of time after they leave as the germs last for hours."
2020-02-28 15:50,"I think we're seeing all too clearly that the ""starve the beast"" strategy that is so beloved by radical conservatives can have deadly real-world consequences.

Cutting important programs so that the government is small enough to ""drown in a bathtub"" is a great slogan for those who favor red MAGA caps, but this administration and the whole country is now seeing how it looks in practice."
2020-02-28 15:52,Thank you for insuring that we remain informed while this Administration tries again to hide and twist the truth - caring only about image and not about the safety and well being of the American people.
2020-02-28 15:36,"According to this article:  The whistle-blower said their own health concerns were dismissed by senior administration officials as detrimental to staff “morale.” They were “admonished,” the complainant said, and “accused of not being team players,” and had their “mental health and emotional stability questioned.”

Is there more than one whistle-blower?"
2020-02-28 16:11,"What about the Census workers all over the country that are currently counting the homeless, group homes and in a few weeks all the people who have not returned their Census forms by mail. 
Has the government considered postponing the count for few months? It seems to be scheduled for the worst possible time."
2020-02-28 16:12,"I'm trying to be fair and not knee-jerk to recriminations over whether our government response is adequate. 

It won't be as heavy handed as China's. 
It's inconceivable that a democracy would lock down 10 million people in a large American metropolitan area - or even could. 

My issue, if I really tap my mind and gut is that I don't know how much of our federal agencies and how many positions have been ""Trumpified"" if I may coin a phrase. 

Meaning, are federal officials, now charged with handling this grave situation, truly free to do a job or do they make each move with an eye on how it will appear in public. 
Specifically how it will play with the politics of pro-Trump. How will it play into the unspoken (and spoken) notion that team Trump comes before reality itself. 

Because, that is a very dangerous notion here. 

Example- “Every precaution has been taken,” said Dr. Walters, the head of operational medicine at the (State) department’s Bureau of Medical Services. “I can say unequivocally that everyone involved with those evacuations were properly equipped and trained.”

So, I searched Dr. Walters. 
Found a Q and A from State Dept. about the return of US residents from Japan. 
Here:

Read it. My antennae went up. 
Are the State Dept. people serving us or the president? Dr. Walters doesn't inspire trust. 

Any administration has faults. 
But, with Trump, it's hard to trust."

2020-02-28 16:49,Will Paul Randass ask to know the name of the whistleblower? Will the rest of the trump party follow? Will the trump party continue to tell the red team everything that Democrats say? And accuse Democrats of doing exactly what they're doing? This is the most inept administration led by an idiot that thinks he knows everything.
2020-02-28 16:09,"""...senior officials there ... believed the whistle-blower was making the accusations in an effort to protect their job ....""

Maybe so and maybe not; I've seen it go both ways.  The reality is that such training and equipment would be the responsibility of professional/career staff and far removed from political interests.  In my blissful ignorance, it sounds like the wrong agency and personnel were assigned.  Firemen put out the fire, medical personnel care for the sick and injured.  This sounds like medical personnel were sent to fight the fire."

  I don't get it.  Were these people listening to the news for the last month?  This virus is extremely contagious, and it can be spread before the infected show symptoms. Any visual report includes health workers completely clad in protective clothing."
2020-02-28 16:13,"If the coronavirus takes hold in the USA, and it happened to infect both the President and Vice President, and -- God forbid -- they should both succumb, the leader of the House would become president.

Fauci of NIH led the government's response to the HIV epidemic of the 1980's and 1990's; his informative comments to the public on the status of the epidemic were essential to keeping us informed and he has continued to provide insight on subsequent viral epidemics. And now this world renown virologist has to answer to the likes of Pence. It's truly the upside down world of Alice in Wonderland with Trump the mad queen, screaming ""OFF WITH THEIR HEADS!""

At this point, I'm wondering how much more of Trump's craziness his base can keep swallowing. They weren't  bothered by Trump seeing crowds that aren't there and they accept losing farms from Trump's tariffs because that's the price of MAGA. But current estimates are that the mortality rate of COVID 19 is 10 times greater than that of seasonal flu and we've just learned infection can occur without direct contact with foreign travel. So we're still trying to figure out this virus and Trump can't see any danger except to his standing. It is possible that all of us, including Trump's base, could have family, friends, acquaintances who become victims of this virus. I wonder if Trump's followers can shrug off deaths close to home even as they fear for their own health. And can they still believe Trump has their interests in mind rather than his own popularity. 

And can Trump hide the figures of a falling stock market? How long can he keep faking it?"

Putting people at risk is their specialty, along with promoting conflict and blaming victims.

This is a crime that will reverberate across the country.

The truth matters. Reality is real. Boosterism and lies have consequences, and this story is about to get much bigger, thanks to reality. Sadly, I can say I wish it was not true, but it is about time that consequences got a front seat."

2020-02-28 18:32,One thing is for certain in this mess. Our government better learn from their mistakes  because this will happen again. These virus's have been showing up in history for ages and it will not cease to continue. God bless us all.

They stated that we should always be washing hands and staying vigilant; and stay home if sick.  Even though we get vaccination, we may still get the flu as it mutates.  

These statements were made readily available, including by the NYTimes.

Now we are to read multiple articles per day in the NYTimes about corona virus infections, testing inadequacy, etc.  This is being pushed, and given the previous statements from experts, it appears the NYTimes and media in general are trying to create a panic.  While the impact of having the Chinese stay home and not work (huge, given the trade imbalance) is real, the panic around this virus is overblown."

2020-02-28 21:46,"Maybe Trump would like to meet this whistleblower face to face?  Without proper protective gear?  But no!!! He'll have Pense do it.  

I think it's pretty clear how that woman ( who doesn't know anyone who was in a ""hot zone"" or traveled herself ) got it.  she lived in the area of the airforce base that housed the people who were.  And the ""authorities"" were not properly informed, nor following infectious disease protocol.   Traveled by plane on a commercial flight with the US afterwords? 

I'm less concerned with China lying about the numbers of the sick and dead; than I am about our administration acting like this is no big deal.   

My husband works in a hospital...he is completely  distraught about this."
2020-02-28 23:01,If this was a normal administration I would be shocked at the incompetence. This is just another day in the Trump administration. We thought he might kill us all by getting us into a war but his administration contributing to a possible pandemic might be his legacy. I hope the Evangelicals are praying for us because we are going to need it. Truth matters. Facts matter. Science matters.
2020-02-27 16:24,"The temporary closing of schools sends a strong signal to the world that Japan is taking this seriously.  It will be a major disruption to family life, but after living in Japan for years, I can say that it is a society that knows how to work together and follow rules.

Since there has been no domestic testing for the last few months, while it has been highly possible for the virus to arrive here, it's quite likely that many domestic cases will be found in the next week or so, which may shock governments into drastic measures."
2020-02-27 16:48,"The currently situation in Japan isn't very transparent. They are not testing people with symptoms, raising the suspicion of trying to salvage the summer games by covering up the truth of a possible outbreak. This step might be the most correct thing JP government has done in this outbreak, however it makes people worry about the actual situation in Japan right now."
2020-02-27 16:55,"Good analysis, judgement, and action by a leader who understands mega-management in mass populations. China was on the verge of a national hiatus when this hit, many countries suspend everything each August, soon the cherry trees will bloom."
2020-02-27 17:07,"You might as well close all schools in France, Germany, Italy, and Spain. Japan's geographic proximity to China is a minor consideration now. Air travel has resulted in a situation in which Europe might as well be as close to China as Japan is.

Covid-19 is a virus. It doesn't know what political borders drawn on a map are. The virus is conveyed from one person to another. Now that the virus has made its way to every continent except Antarctica, if Japan is closing all its schools, every other country should as well. Or not."
2020-02-27 17:15,"No wonder the stock market is getting hit. This is pretty likely to happen in the US. And then how will people work? 

The only thing I’m hopeful for at this point is that warmer weather will negatively effect the virus like it does with the annual flu season. If that’s the case, It’s probably best if as many countries as possible take similar measures and wait it out."
2020-02-27 17:15,"This will only slow spread, not prevent it.  Circulation of adults will still cause spread.  The virus will be present in Japan this summer.   Along with the remainder of the world.  I suspect that turnout for the olympics will be very low.  I'd say better than 50/50 that it ultimately is cancelled."
2020-02-27 17:16,"What about all of the athletes, spectators, reporters and others coming from around the world for the Olympics?  Will Chinese, South Koreans, Italians, etc be allowed into Tokyo?  What kind of testing of people will take place? Won't the Olympic Village and venues be petri dishes (the new favorite term) for infection?  What happens when everyone returns home with possible infection?  It might be better to exercise caution and postpone the summer olympics one year ."
2020-02-27 17:29,"If the virus continues to spread, the Olympics will have to be cancelled.

What's the point of doing our best to stop the spread if we allow potentially ill people from all over the world to gather? Another scenario could be that people don't come at all, because of the disease (possibly because of travel ban, or strong advice from governments).

Also, athletes may get sick too, what's the point of the Olympics if not all athletes can be present?

2020-02-27 16:24,"No sure how this will impact the Olympics.  Even if Japan remains virus free until then, the Olympics involve hundreds of thousands of visitors from around the globe, and the athlete villages are notorious for the sharing of bodily fluids.

In other words, by the end of the Olympics, half of Japan will have the corona virus.

We're going to need to accept the fact that like with the flu viruses, we're all going to catch it sooner or later.  For 98% of us, it'll be just one more temporary illness."

2020-02-27 17:00,"The reporters should dig into WHY there aren't as many reported cases.  Abe's government is not being proactive about assessing the spike in ""flu"" patients to determine if it's the COVID19 virus or not.  They are only increasing the likelihood that the coronavirus spreads and that the Olympics will be canceled. The lack of transparency and the willful ignorance is more damaging...end of story."
2020-02-27 17:05,"It’s interesting how this story follows a an article yesterday about how Japan’s leadership were really casual about this virus. 

Abe was dropping into meetings on Coronavirus for a few minutes here and there, but seemed to be managing it politically, without making sure the government handled it well.

Officials clearly mishandled the cruise ship quarantine by letting people out without testing or treatment, including officials who entered the ship during the quarantine. 

It looks like leaders had no plans for the virus reaching Japan until it came, no awareness of where it is, how it spreads, and who’s most at risk. The combination of articles suggests Abe thought, “the Olympics are on the line so let’s go big and force parents to stay home or hire childcare for a month. Maybe that will shut up the critics.”

While news reports have noted kids can carry the virus, kids tend to display its mildest symptoms or none at all. Still, the stated reason, “protect the kids,” fits the asthmatic kid whose mother was interviewed. But it looks more like a way to slow transmission to vulnerable adults with a less direct economic impact than China’s interventions.

In Japan’s leaders’ defense, Japan and South Korea have extremely close economic relations with China and both have seen rapid exposure to the virus. South Korea recently overtook Japan in confirmed cases, but that may be the result of Japan failing to test. China censored early warnings, so this is a low info, late response."
2020-02-27 17:26,"I noticed in The Times's previous article about possibly canceling the Olympics that the athletes themselves were barely mentioned. It was all about the money.

And that was apt. The Olympics is a weird combination of three weeks of NBC soap opera, three weeks of ads by giant corporations, and three weeks of beggar-thy-neighbor jingoistic breast-beating. 

These three malign attributes are at their worst in the U.S.; at least other countries don't have to suffer NBC or so much we're-#1-ism. Especially in the U.S., the athletes themselves are merely the talent, the vehicle for delivering the money and nationalist spectacles.

If the Olympics are canceled, it will buttress the proverb that there's a silver lining to any cloud."
2020-02-27 16:59,"My feeling is that the 2020 Summer Olympics are not going to happen. (Would any athletes from China be allowed/able to participate?) They should make this call now, and simply postpone to Summer 2021."
2020-02-27 16:31,This is a necessary step to protect the lives of students and teachers. I can’t believe so-called public health experts are bashing this move. Would they rather Japan take the Chinese route and respond to the outbreak weeks late—after it is already too far spread to stop?
2020-02-27 17:34,"This is ridiculous. What do they think parents will be doing with their homebound children? I would be at the library, cat cafes, and play spaces because kids need to run around and play! They believe that will halt the spread of the disease?

They would be better served to hire staff to more closely monitor hand washing and other hygiene procedures in the schools. Japan already has a population problem of there not being enough children. What message does this send to those considering starting or expanding families?"
2020-02-27 17:38,"I'm a teacher. If my school is closed, will they pay me?"
2020-02-27 18:00,"So how does all of this end?

Like the flu or other diseases it never really goes away.  Won't it be one more disease we all can catch?  Is it really feasible to lock down the world until it goes away?"

2020-02-27 18:18,People need to relax.  Fear drives people to do irrational things.  The Tokyo 2020 Olympics are not going to be cancelled or rescheduled.  The athletes have been preparing their whole lives for a moment to shine and experience Olympic glory.  It's the largest sporting event in the world.  The only Olympics that have been cancelled were during wartime.  The RIO Olympics went forward with the Zika virus.  By May everything will be OK and people will have calmed down.
2020-02-27 17:53,"Congratulations. This is a brilliant move, to protect the entire population. Until we have more Facts about this particular Virus, this is a very wise and prudent move.
   Well Done, Japan."
2020-02-27 19:07,"This a great move! Not necessarily for the olympics but for health reasons. Schools are just acting like little transmission stations with kids picking it up from home friends etc and mixing it around etc etc. drastic measures are necessary to cut the spread at some point. Schools are a huge part of it, perhaps the major part. Then you have transportation, and other things where people congregate, shops etc. but schools are a good start."
2020-02-27 19:29,"The scope of this pandemic is just now coming into focus. 
No one is prepared to grapple with this.
Yes, great that the kids are out of school and at home. But with working parents, now what? Japan's economy tanks even further? 
Japan's work ethic is extreme. People will be fired for being absent because of kids being home and replaced with childless/single people. 
Though closing schools seems like a good idea it is not well thought out. 
It is because of the Olympics. And many families are facing big pressures because of this new policy. The pandemic is worrisome enough. Now this. I hope the government guarantees the jobs of parents who must stay home with their kids."

Only about 1,500 cases tested so far as opposed to 50,000  in Korea next door, when their pattern vis a vis travel and exchange with China is pretty similar. It makes one wonder about the numbers....after all, the less you test, the less cases you discover.

The corporate sponsors will not abide a postponement, nor indeed will NBC, which has the Broadcasting rights. The Olympics Athletes themselves would risk competing in Downtown Wuhan, just for the opportunity to win the Medals that they have trained their whole lives for. Oh, you might see some Basketball Teams or Soccer Teams having some players who balk at participating, but that would be about all. About the biggest concession to public health would be to hold the Games, but not compete in front of crowds of spectators in attendance at the respective events."

2020-02-27 19:38,"13 years ago, I warned schools and colleges, in a 2007 Philadelphia Inquirer story, to prepare for an epidemic (like the coronavirus), stating: “Suppose a terrorist or epidemic disrupts an entire county or city school district, forcing schools and area colleges to close indefinitely? Where would the teachers and professors go to teach, and where would the students go to learn?” Unfortunately, few schools and colleges heeded that warning, and today lack a comprehensive online teaching strategy to comply with yesterday’s CDC Advisory.

One year earlier, in 2006, I wrote the an OpEd (""Schools must learn to use Internet to quickly recover from disaster"", Gannett, 12/4/2006), stating ""School board members and college trustees have a fiduciary responsibility to ensure that their institutions have comprehensive plans for online learning. They must set reasonable goals for course and faculty development, and ensure their constituents (faculty, students, parents, and administrators) that, in the event of a prolonged crisis, the business of educating students will continue, albeit in a different environment.""

Let’s hope this is the final “wake-up” call needed by schools and colleges."

2020-02-28 6:27,"I work at a private kindergarten in Japan, so it’s not specifically covered by this policy. When we found out this morning that our school would most likely go ahead and close on Monday regardless, I was very relieved - seems like a reasonable precaution to protect students and staff.

Only to find out later in the day that although our kindergarten will technically be “closing down,” at least for classes, it’ll be converted to a massive daycare for both our students and those from the local elementary school. So there will be no improvement in public health or in safety for our students and staff.

This approach - technically following the order but ignoring the spirit of it / why it was ordered in the first place - encapsulates what I’ve seen in Japan the last few weeks. Both the government and private enterprises have been dragging their feet, and sloppy about implementation whenever they do decide to do something. Generally, people have either been pretending there’s no problem, or worrying about it publicly without doing much to protect themselves or others.

The way things are going, I won’t be surprised if there’s a massive outbreak here in the next few weeks. And since the government has only tested about 1000 people so far (!!!), there may already be way more cases than we’re aware of."
2020-02-27 22:13,"I live in Japan, and I have kids in school. I'm fortunate that I can work from home, but many aren't so lucky.

The profits of sponsors and broadcasters?"
2020-02-27 20:51,"This is blatantly lipservice, just so that the Abe government can say they're doing *something* after they failed to do practically anything about the whole Diamond Princess deal.

If both parents are working (which is becoming more and more common), who's to take care of their children for two weeks? Their elderly parents, who probably live pretty far away in rural areas (and who, as elderly people, are more susceptible to catching a disease, too)? Daycares and private schools can't handle even a temporary influx of children; there are not enough of them, much less employees. It's also close to impossible to get time off for any one of the parents for them to take care of their kids themselves.

This won't solve a single thing."

2020-02-28 9:32,"Japan released almost 1,000 people from the Diamond Princess cruise ship who were exposed to Covid-19 earlier this month. Japan denied that their on-ship quarantine failed until other countries reported that repatriated passengers tested positive and/or became ill. Despite this gross mismanagement and keeping open boarders with China well into the Chinese crisis, Japan miraculously has not seen an increase in Covid-19 cases. 

Japan is silencing voices of dissenting health professionals and refusing to test exposed or ill people in order to avoid reporting confirmed cases. It seems likely that this is a desperate attempt to lessen the economic impact of the outbreak, especially vis a vis the olympics. Either that or Japan is unbelievably lucky... kinda like Indonesia."

As for the parents, most staff will remain at school to babysit students of dual-income parents who cannot provide childcare.

Not all schools will stay closed the whole month. Mine decided to only close for two weeks. Prime Minister’s word isn’t yet law, it seems."
2020-02-28 13:49,"I agree that the closure of a lot of schools all over Japan itself is right. The problem is that Abe didn't tell its plan even to the Minister of Education until just before he announced it officially. According to reports, no one in the administration could stop Abe's claim.

Most schools must suddenly have the final day the day after Abe's decision. What will happen to the lives of single mothers or part-time teachers from the next week? The government still has no specific plans to compensate them."
2020-02-28 14:58,"Abe's decision is contrary to the current scientific knowledge about coronavirus and the current management by his government. Coronavirus is affecting the children less, and it is likely that even if they are infected, they are unlikely to get tested, due to the minor nature of the disease in children and the strict restrictions on testing (need to have 3-4 days of fever with signs of shortness of breath). However, it is understandable for delaying, while buying time for the weather to get warmer. It can be noted that the worst area is the coldest area in Japan. Although he has completely mismanaged the Cruise ship and the current outbreak, I think Olympics will happen, despite the reduced crowds."

It was the pilots and flight attendants of American Airlines and United who stopped our flights with China. You can only thank our workers who were questioning the safety of doing nothing.

No it isn't.  It's a virus that is rapidly spreading around the globe.  Viruses don't respond to lies.  They just spread and infect people.  Once a highly contagious microbe gets introduced into the human population, its stays there and keeps infecting people, year after year, until it is eradicated with a vaccine, which requires global immunizations.  

Trump sees the stock markets tanking.  That worries him because a high market is his ticket to re-election.  So he puts his top sycophant, Mike Pence,  in charge.

After 14 days those who do not have symptoms can resume activities and those with symptoms would have been treated as soon as symptoms showed up if they reported their symptoms. Crazy right?

2020-02-27 12:31,"Every morning I wake up and read the virus updates- every night before bed, I do that again. 

 What I truly cannot get over is how fast this thing has spread.

Scary."
2020-02-27 12:52,"But wait...Trump said there were only 15 cases in the US!  But wait...Trump said the stock market drop was because of the Democrat debate on Tuesday....even though the drop began on Monday.    But wait....Trump said he had the best people....yet Chad Wolf couldn't answer questions ....from a Republican congressman no less.   Really, the potential for botching the response to a crisis here in the United States is being left to an administration that is told to downplay everything that could harm Trump's reelection.  The people in our country are in the hands of individuals who have been placed in their positions because they are loyal to Trump.   Not to our country.   The next rally is more important to Trump than the necessity of providing kits etc. to the states.  This is what the country voted for.  Money."
2020-02-27 12:53,"This virus has already spread worldwide and is currently spreading undetected in our communities. Based on previous outbreaks of flu and other similar illnesses, we can expect at least 50% of the world population will get infected. About 1% of them will probably die. The current world population being 7.5 billion, we are looking at approximately 38 million additional deaths in the next few months to a year. The good news is that the majority of those will be the elderly and infirm. 

There will be some short term disruption of daily life, but it is hardly the end of the world. We humans have survived far worse things."
2020-02-27 12:50,"With Pence ""handling"" the crisis in the US, Trump is free to continue his manic pursuit of a perfect golf handicap. Too bad he's wasted so much time on the links in the last three years, rather than spending just a little of it on emergency preparedness.

Presidents take an oath to protect our nation against all threats foreign and domestic. I guess he ignored his."

2020-02-27 12:55,"Many companies nowadays let their employees work from home, allowing them to remote in with their laptops.  They could be forced to order all employees to work remotely until this pandemic subsides or until the weather gets warmer.  Companies don't want the stigma of keeping their offices open and being accused of spreading the infection."
2020-02-27 12:56,"If we had competent leadership, we would have been prepared. We could have manufactured enough test kits here in the USA...this would  be jobs. They should be handed out or available at your local pharmacy. Denial at the top prevails, until the stock market makes the point."
2020-02-27 12:56,"I think so far, the only people I’ve seen cover this correctly is NPR. The lead-in of the article:

“Don’t panic, but have a plan.”

The fact is, causing panic and xenophobia can cause the virus to expand quicker, not slow it down. Imagine being a person who’s just started presenting symptoms, but gripping with the realization that because you are sick, your fellow countrywomen/men could treat you with open hostility, demand you become quarantined for an indefinite amount of time... that can be a super, super scary thing. 

There’s a lot of incentive to try to hide the symptoms and try to slip past a port of entry with symptoms undetected. We need to show compassion for people who have become infected. Let them know they will be met with kindness, medical care, and treated with dignity. Panic, fear, and xenophobia are 100% guaranteed ways to make this pandemic worse."
2020-02-27 12:27,"In the international media, there is strong doubt that the number of Covid-19 infections in the USA is far more than the number officially announced by US officials.

Chinese animal husbandry and hygiene are poor, and failures are made worse by a social system that punishes whistleblowers and demands unthinking obedience. 

In other parts of the world, the fostering of certain ideas and beliefs reliably results in violence. 

There is only one world, and we all have to rub along on it. How can retreating into nationalistic silos be helpful to that?"
2020-02-27 13:18,"The high numbers in Italy is also due to the fact that, contrarily to many countries and the US, they did thousands of tests there to check possible infections.  In other countries other infections may be going on for a while as well. Also, some of the patients who died in Italy were tested only post-portem.  Therefore, since the deaths comprise only old people who suffer from other pathologies, it is possible that in other countries the deaths from coronavirus may have been overlooked."
2020-02-27 13:19,I'm particularly concerned about a pharmaceutical shortage including strong pain medications used to treat certain diseases such as cancer. A family member has cancer and I'm terrified that he won't have all the medications he needs to deal with this illness. This is what we get when we farm out all commerce to other nations. Those nations are now locking their borders.

He wouldn't say that if it were not true now would he?
He has put only 2 billion into fighting it whereas Obama put in 8 billion for Ebola and appointed a Czar to coordinate the response. What does Trump do? Puts the worldly and dynamic medical expert Mike Pence in charge.
Great time to have a grievously incompetent and aggrieved stable genius ""running"" the country; cutting back agencies and programs just when they are needed."
2020-02-27 13:12,"The ""regular"" flu infects millions each year and kills 100,000 ... and that's with vaccinations and previous exposure immunity that lessons the threat.  

Covid19 is a new flu, infecting and racing through a nearly virgin population (so a LOT more people could be infected than with the ""regular"" flu), with comparable mortality rates.  

That is a very bad thing.  Praying won't help."
2020-02-27 13:06,"Biggest earthmoving machinery exhibition held in Italy, SaMoTer, was just moved to May. This shows that, what ever happens to the outbreak in Italy, its affect are already going to have economic impact on the region.

On other stories, where some commentators have been proposing closure of European internal borders, I don't really see this happening this yet.

Some health screening at borders could be possible, but I don't think anyone in Europe is really suggesting putting back passport controls and customs actions, which would add huge cost to any cross border activities within Europe. 

That would be equal measure in States to New Jersey and New York suddenly setting up passport control point to the tunnel and bridges. Massive traffic jams and economic cost calculated in billions. 

Health check's and temperature scanning are an aspect that could appear on the borders, but even the passport controls did not blog Chinese tourists from Wuhan spreading to virus to Northern tourist locations of Italy. Pisa, Verona, Milan and Venice being on that list of affected cities by now. 

Maybe faster acting by Chinese officials could have done that, but the extra months they waited added to hundreds of thousands of new cases globally in the end, and the common temperature scanning in many Asian airports already before the corona outbreak were not enough to stop it from spreading, when the new virus emerged."
2020-02-27 13:23,"THIS is why the wealthy need to pay their fair of taxes so that all people of a population receive quality health care no matter their income. Furthermore, taxes pay for public health infrastructure which has been decimated by the likes of Trump. This virus doesn’t care if you’re rich or poor and you absolutely should want everyone cared for so your personal chances of contracting a communal contagion are lowered.

Personally, I’m thrilled that if a pandemic is to happen, it’s happening while Trump and anti-science evangelicals are in power and just months before the most important election in US history. Nature is about to teach them a lesson about science and as long as everyone rallies behind whoever wins the Democratic nomination, this four year descent into primitivism can come to an end."
2020-02-27 13:12,"Maybe the world needs to take a 14+ day vacation and just stay home.  But before the mandatory vacation order is given, prepare with food and supplies.  Allow no international travel or travel on crowded public transportation.  Set up medical response teams and infected quarantine zones.  Freeze all financial obligations for this vacation period.  Have minimal staff at infrastructure sites.  Everyone stay connected via the internet while it works.  Reacquaint with family and friends.  Reduce stress and relax.  Take a break from the real world.  Use time as the therapy to wait out the infection period.  Then begin again hopefully with the virus treat reduced, and maybe a new perspective on life."

2020-02-27 13:11,My wife’s friends in Wuhan say that everything is still in lockdown and the outbreak is most certainly NOT under control. Western leaders should not trust anything Beijing is reporting about the virus.
2020-02-27 13:26,"I don't think we really know anything accurate about this infection. if people can infect others without showing symptoms themselves, it will make the job of tracking infection rates impossible. 

It's also appalling that all states don't yet have testing mechanisms. The virus is moving far more quickly than American readiness."
2020-02-27 13:46,"The CDC needs to release the test protocols to all Hospital, college and pharmaceutical labs in the Country now. Then the various governors can commandeer that capacity to local Health departments to build up capacity and shorten diagnosis time and add redundancy to the system. I have no doubt the lab personal around the country will jump on to help."
2020-02-27 13:51,"Anyone who thinks that Africa will be spared the coronavirus is engaging with harmful wishful thinking.  The first two cases have now been detected in north Africa, and it seems an epidemic further south is inevitable.  Why:  More than 200,000 Chinese construction and other workers are in China, and it defies logic to think some have not been infected and passed on the infections.  

Same thing is true in Sri Lanka and Myanmar, where many thousands of Chinese nationals work on infrastructure project.  

It seems likely that either the cases in these areas are not being reported or the limited public health systems are not broadly testing for the disease (or their positive findings are not being reported to the public.)

This negligent willingness to let the epidemic spread in these less developed areas with many, many Chinese workers will, I believe, turn out to be the historical scandal of the pandemic."
2020-02-27 13:53,Every request for testing of suspected cases by our university group has been denied. Even request  by sub-specialist in immunology/respiratory disease have been denied. If even sub-specialists cannot buck the health department inertia to obtain testing of suspected cases the pandemic will remain silent. Bureaucrats are overruling physicians. That’s where we are.
2020-02-27 14:10,"Nature always bats last, in this case probably using wild bats consumed for food alongside maybe pangolins. 

Humans will try to shape the outcome (and shift the blame). But if a 1-2% mortality rate and high degree of contagiousness bear out, it's potentially devastating. We have a limited capacity to surge ICU care, let alone safely screen masses of potentially infected people. If healthcare workers become ill at significant rates, as they have in China, we risk potential collapse threatening everyone needing emergency care or hospitalization. 

In times like these we need to rely on experts and the best science, not scientifically naive politicians with self serving goals. There's nothing in three years of Trumpian fecklessness, mendacity, and capriciousness to inspire confidence."

Let's start with the common sense solutions."
2020-02-27 14:17,"Community spread does not mean immaculate infection.  

The virus was obviously transmitted to the infected person.  The infected person may not have been aware they came into contact with a previously infected person - didn't know that person was infected, touched something with body fluids on it, etc.  They many not have remembered the contact.  Or, they may not have admitted the contact when interviewed by a health official because they didn't want to be quarantined.
That is why quarantines are not sufficiently effective to stop a virulent infection from becoming an epidemic.

Trump is putting our lives and our economy at risk by down playing the threat to protect his re-election chances.  Trump put VP Pence in charge of the federal effort, not to protect us as much as to protect the political messaging and avoid contradicting Trump.

Believe our experts in the Centers for Disease Control, not politicians who are putting their re-election ahead of protecting Americans."
2020-02-27 12:55,Troubling reporting coming out of NYTimes that the new case in California could not be tested for days due to strict CDC guidelines on who can be tested.  Meanwhile in S Korea they are aggressively testing the population.  Why is the CDC refusing to test people???  This is insane.
2020-02-27 13:59,"No matter the context I always marvel at how CLEAN the rest of the world manages to keep its subways.  Supposedly NY is a 'blue' city but it (and the rest of our cities) looks as though it's inhabited by drunken louts.  Who raised these people?  

We would have to clean our subways before we could disinfect them.  By that time everybody would be dead."
2020-02-27 14:12,Remember all the outrage about China suppressing initial info? What are we doing here? Don’t test don’t tell?
2020-02-27 14:13,"Testing is key to tracking, containing and mitigating the virus and its spread. Yet, of all countries, the U.S. has essentially no functioning, reliable testing in place or even in the works even today: only 426 tests have been done to date in the US, a country with a population of 350 milllion. Austria with a population of 8.4 million has done more than that! Tests in many other countries with a fraction of the US population have conducted tests literally in the hundreds of thousands.That is a scandal and criminally negligent. 

Moreover, the CDC not only has a policy of testing only those who have either travelled to China or been in touch with people who have, while refusing to test anyone else - see California case- which is utterly absurd, but the limited number of testing kits it did distribute were flawed and faulty. In other words, there simply are no functioning test kits to be found anywhere in the US!

Finally, there is no central data collection point to register results and inform on cases even if tests were conducted. 

So, in fact, the U.S. government hasn't a clue what the actual number of corona cases in the country is and, ergo,is  in absolutely no position to meet a growing crisis. Could the NY Times please research my claims further and report regularly on the status of this sad and irresponsible state of affairs so that CDC might put some steam behind the development, approval, production and distribution of reliable test kits?"

Seriously?
After all the evasion, and outright misinformation from China, for WEEKS and WEEKS, now the game is to give stick to Iran?
Granted, Iran has its own long-standing struggle with transparency, but the fawning over China's official statements (I'm looking at you, WHO) and the credible reports of people being *welded* into their apartment buildings, important morbidity and mortality data being wholly fabricated to minimize everyone else's understanding of the situation, the lack of questioning about these enormous vehicles spreading a mystery mist across populated areas of cities -- We really need to back-up and look at what we've already glossed-over as this has spread globally: The Chinese  Government's misrepresentation and abject dishonesty. Then we can start in on criticizing all the other regimes around the world. But this catastrophe unquestionably started with CHINA, not Iran.    
Public Health is inherently an evidence-based discipline. China's malign decisions from the very start of this outbreak can not be ignored -- they have put the population of the whole world at risk. Everything else that comes after is a reaction."
2020-02-27 14:06,Our CDC cannot even test people easily and that endangers all who are in contact with patients where the diagnosis is in doubt because of red tape. Trump's response is disjointed and he is attempting to assert his version of the truth (which is a lie). Other countries featured in this article  (except for the autocratic ones) are much more on top of this virus. Americans deserve better.
2020-02-27 13:52,It is appalling that the federal government has not enabled expansive testing of COVID-19 across communities given the month plus it is had to prepare.  We are in a tenuous position while we blindly await cases of this illness in communities.  We have no idea the extent of the US transmission.  Swift action must be taken to broadly test.

2020-02-27 12:16,"How are workers in the US expected to stay home when most states have no requirement to offer paid sick time to part-time workers? Will the federal government be providing this money or will the US simply have no chance of containing this virus due to workers needing to be at work in order to pay rent/food?

How do the new rules about work requirements tied to receiving food stamps impact individuals who are ill? Are we really going to deny food to sick citizens or are we going to force them to work while sick?

Part of the prevention of any disease is access to nutrition and shelter. While children are not being heavily impacted by this virus, they may be left more vulnerable to other illnesses as a result of policies currently in place. Roll backs in the nutritional value of school lunches this past year, coupled with financial impact families may face leaves our country, and especially our children, at risk.  

Any coronavirus policy that does not address the individual financial impact of the virus leaves all other policies useless."
2020-02-27 12:58,It seems sad that Mike Pence has been deemed sufficiently qualified to oversee the nation's efforts to control the potential spread of a virus that could easily wrack our nation's health care system. This is not unlike asking Betsy DeVos to be the secretary of education.
2020-02-27 12:48,"The problem here in the US that is not getting much play is that only 12 of the 100 public health labs are able to diagnose COVID-19 virus because the test for doing so developed by the CDC is faulty.

That means that people with a respiratory illness that may actually be a symptom  of the COVID-19 virus can move about unknowingly spreading the virus until the full extent of the illness sets in.

This does not sound like, as Trump proclaimed, that we are the best prepared country in the world to deal with this virus."
2020-02-27 12:26,"I’m a teacher and I’m thinking ahead. I’m a very robust 70 so I’m not worried about myself.

And also if the schools are closed what will I get paid. Might need to add more to savings.

These are practical concerns."

Think of the numbers of international travelers these people came into contact with? 
The president and his wife were with countless people and exposed to many, many environments. Then came home to the White House and staff. 
It would have been far wiser to have cancelled the trip in the interest of the health and welfare of all and eliminated the risk in bringing more cases to the United States. 
Am I the only person wondering about this?"
2020-02-27 14:55,I read that Trump wants to spend at least an additional 2.5 billion dollars to keep out invaders from a foreign country.

2020-02-27 15:03,"I am counting on our pharmaceutical giants to develop vaccine fast enough to counter the attacks by Coronavirus. Actually several drugs of our own including Gilead Science are in the field testing stages right in the middle of local Wuhan hospitals treating the most severely infected patients.  In the middle of April, the trying results should be out showing the effectiveness of these drugs.

We have joint projects with the Chinese government and public research institutions many years back on virus research.  We have collected many samples from China into our labs to study the virus.  Our private pharmaceutical companies have participated in this, and have been studying to find anti-virus remedy.  And Gilead Science is just one of them and had an early start to find cure to the virus.

This Coronavirus will come and go away.  But it could be like Influenza virus reappear yearly for a long time.  As long as we have the vaccine developed, it won't be a problem."
2020-02-27 15:01,"Three weeks ago while sitting in a local park I couldn’t help but notice a Chinese family of five all of whom were wearing face masks. At the time I thought the precautions odd and unnecessary, but looking back I wonder if, in fact, they didn’t have information and an understanding of this virus than I did. I wish now I had asked."
2020-02-27 15:08,"Yesterday afternoon I canvassed an 82 year old woman from West Virginia in a middle income neighborhood in Cary, NC.  She was the daughter of a coal miner.

When the topic of health care came up, she told me that someone in her family was fearful that he had the coronavirus and went to get himself checked out.  The  doctor recommended he take a series of tests, just in case it was something else.  The first bill only came a few days later...over $2500.   

Based upon my experience with the health care industry other surprise bills may turn up later because he went to see a doctor.    

Is this anyway to ward off an epidemic?   How many sick people will continue to go to work because they have to pay their rent and bills and know they cannot afford to see a doctor?

Panic about the disease per se and any individual's health might be premature until more is known on how deadly and contagious the virus actually is. Even under most worst case scenarios, mortality while greater than the flu, seems manageable and capable of being adapted to.

In other words the damaging effects to the economy will be far more painful for most people."

2020-02-27 15:49,"There is an obvious source - Travis Air Force Base is is Solano County, where this patient was infected. That’s where the coronavirus-infected individuals from the Diamond Princess are right now."
2020-02-27 16:14,Why is there not more testing?   There must be more testing immediately.  Can’t think of a single good reason they wouldn’t want to know the true scale of the epidemic in America.  I can think of several bad ones.
2020-02-27 16:15,"Has anyone connected the spread of this virus to the rise of climate change? Emerita historian Bruce Campbell of Queen's University Belfast has very convincingly linked the robustness of particular medieval diseases to changes in climate during that same period - and their temperature changes were much smaller in magnitude than what we have already experienced.

It seems possible that a changing climate could facilitate the survival of different kinds of pathogens and viruses, or even be linked to their independent generation in multiple locations. I'm no expert, but if there has been research on this I would love to hear about it. Climate change is shifting animal and bacteria (and perhaps viral) populations around the world: should it be part of our global discussions about public health?"
2020-02-27 16:16,"One case of unconfirmed origin means there are dozens of undetected cases out there and by the time the origin is figured out you’d have hundred if not thousands of cases already as in the case of Korea and Iran.

Think about it this way. We know the person in CA caught it from another person and each infected infects 1.5-3.5 people (R-0 number). A person can start spreading after 5 days on average. Flight from China have been suspended for 26 days starting Feb 1st.

Assume someone entered the US carrying the disease on Feb 1st when flights suspended
on 02/06 - 2.5 people infected
02/11 - 6.25
02/16 - 15.625
02/21 - 39.0625
02/26 - 97.65625

Remember the total number of cases are addition of all infected, not just the number of recently infected. And my calculation do not take into account super spreaders that infect dozens."
2020-02-27 16:39,"Like computer viruses, the spread of coronavirus is an unavoidable consequence of the world becoming a global village.  Getting closer to anyone increases your risk of catching something from them.  That's just the way it is.  Putting up real or virtual barriers to keep outsiders away is bound to fail.  In today's world there are no ""outsiders"" or ""insiders.""  When the planet is a global village, countries have no choice but to have their health officials work hand in hand (with rubber gloves on) and make decisions that are binding on all, without individual countries taking the position that they and they alone will decide the health measures to be taken."
2020-02-27 16:40,"Based on my reading about the failed CDC coronavirus testing kit, I am wondering why the CDC doesn't ask China for their testing protocols, especially since it appears that California has a case of ""community spreading,"" as opposed to cases tied to travel or contact with a traveler."
2020-02-27 16:54,"At one point there were only 15 infected people in China ,too.  

Trump parsing the ""original 15"" and sidelining those brought here is irresponsible.  They are here, others will be in contact with them as health care professionals, and as we have seen in China, health care professionals are not immune."
2020-02-27 17:30,"50% of the American people are not vaccinated even for our current flu outbreak, and, not to target anyone or any group, adequate personal hygiene probably stands at the same ratio. I don't fret whether the government is prepared for the spread of a new virus, but rather, whether Americans will themselves rise to the task of personal hygiene and self-quarantine enough to stop large numbers of infections and deaths. It is more important than government readiness, that people understand their own responsibility for advanced hygiene and the many other preventive measures individuals can take as preventative.  I'm not holding my breath.  Oh, I take that back.  I am holding my breath but I doubt it can be held that long."
2020-02-27 17:34,"I'd much appreciate fact-based news coverage with where our country stands in terms of preparedness and plan for tackling this virus. I read from international news that S. Korea and Italy have high numbers, not because there are more cases, but because they are simply testing higher number of their population. Is it true that US/CDC doesn't even have proper test kits and protocols in place? This virus has been in the news for few months now and it seems there wasn't any proactive planning done by govt. We can't help but fear the unknown, but if news outlets are able to provide up-to-date facts and developments, it can help ease the public. It also doesn't help to read so many comments about Trump/Pence (even though I agree we need REAL leaderships at times like this) or other hear-says - all it does it spread fear and rumor."
2020-02-27 17:37,"If anyone has an appreciation of the physical realities, then the situation clearly indicates that there must be considerable uncertainty about what to expect. The efforts to contain the transmission of this virus have reached the limits of effectiveness. The virus is out and is spreading, now. People must prepare to slow it’s transmission while preparing to treat all those who can be saved from the worst outcomes. Vaccination cannot become an option for many months and quarantines are no longer going to stop the pandemic."

Since it now appears that the American people will not receive unbiased, apolitical updates from our government officials about the virus, the Times' transparent coverage becomes all the more critical. Could you please provide a direct link to this page near the top of your electronic editions? Thank you very much."
2020-02-27 17:04,What is more scary than the spread of virus is the spread of lies. The virus will have a cure though.
2020-02-27 17:23,"Where are the people of Wuhan?  The world is concerned about spread of the virus, as it should, but meanwhile 11 million people are locked into their dwellings.  Grocery stores are closed.  Youtube videos of dead patients lying on ER floors and apartment building doors being sodered shut have been taken down.  There have been no videos from inside Wuhan nearly all month except from China news sources."

2020-02-27 17:33,I'm worried about the corona virus because our non-science believing President has cut funding to the CDC over the past few years and forced out those scientists and doctors with experience in pandemics. We  don't know what this will cost all Americans yet. I assume Trump will self-quarantine in the White House.
2020-02-27 16:29,"Peter Daszak in Welcome to the Age of Pandemics, ""As Covid-19 strikes today and a spate of other pathogens are ready to emerge in the future, we continue to butt up against nature. Scientists estimate that there are 1.67 million unknown viruses of the type that have previously emerged in people. Discovering and sequencing them should be a priority — a simple case of “know your enemy.”

The elephant in the increasingly small room that is our planet  looms larger than even Mr. Daszek imagines. Yes, 'we continue to butt up against nature', but sequencing well over a million unknown viruses, even if possible, is not going to save us from our fate. 

Ever since the dawn of global trade, we no longer are contained within the borders of our tribes and pathogens like the Black Plague that killed millions in Europe are going to be the death of us. 

We are too many in a tiny closed space. There is no escape from the 'other'. We are as effectively quarantined on this earth as the passengers of the cruise ship in Japan are.

We can play Whack a Mole as each new disaster strikes, each and every one,  the consequence of our profligate ways, but we aren't going to win. Mother Nature kills without prejudice, plea bargaining falls on deaf ears.

Maybe a few of us will be left to start over and maybe we just might have learned a few things by then. That's my hope, and increasingly and sadly, my only one."
2020-02-27 16:02,"Just practice the same sanitary precautions we were taught as kids. Don't cough or sneeze on people, wash your hands, don't touch your face. 

People with no symptoms can be carriers.  

I wonder what all these screens and touch devices are doing to rational sanitary practices? How long can the virus live on them?"
2020-02-27 16:25,This article says that Japan is the second country to close its schools nationwide after China - actually Vietnam did so a few weeks ago.
2020-02-27 17:24,"I think people should stop fighting along party lines. If this really gets out of hand in the US you won’t have to worry about Trump, Pence, Sanders, Biden, Warren, both Clintons; they’d be dead. None of them are young nor in particular good shape. They’d still be walking around campaigning showing they are healthy until they literally crash like those Iranian politicians."
2020-02-27 16:13,"So the “transparency” that was promised is a lie. No one in the fed, state, local government or medical community is willing to comment on the new case in northern CA. I would like a little more info please. The CDC needs to set up daily briefings, out of the realm of politics. For example, I would like to know how I am going to know if someone merely has a cold, or if someone who appears to merely have a cold has Coronavirus, and ultimately, what difference it makes."
2020-02-27 17:33,"The rapid spread of Covid-19 leads me to believe airliners need to be retrofitted with filtration media and ultraviolet C lights to kill any germs, including the virus as it exits the pressurized cabin through exhaust ports in a likely process of fresh air exchange for the passengers and crew. If the virus is expelled streaming from the planes during flight, it is likely the virus is finding it's way to ground level. Off the shelf filtration media and available Ultraviolet C lights are readily available and can be quickly adapted to easily designed and built porting enclosures to help assure virus laden cabin air is not spread from city to city during the thousands of flights every day. I see this as a needed government mandate and imperative need for all planes. Smoking is no longer allowed on planes so the use of filtration would be easier than if it were."
2020-02-27 16:15,"A responsible president would have begun marshaling the response about the same time China shut down Wuhan. First thing would be to check your ammunition and equipment (to use a military mans perspective). But, here we sit with only happy talk, no test kits, no temporary hospital structures, scrambling to catch up. A General acting in this way would get his men destroyed in battle. We are in real trouble with trump as the General."
2020-02-27 17:21,We can help reduce transmission by eliminating needless travel whether for work or pleasure.  But people just won't do it and then wonder why we can't contain the spread of this.
2020-02-27 16:07,"I suppose Trump's speech on Wednesday, and putting Pence in charge of handling the pandemic, was meant to reassure his base. Even though Pence has no experience in epidemiology, Trump's base knows that Pence will pray, and he will pray fervently. Republicans in congress should be relieved, too. Trump will now have someone else to blame besides the Democrats and the news media if everything gets out of hand, and their idol will again be exonerated."
2020-02-27 16:32,"I'm very concerned for the Syrian refugees in Turkey, Greece, and Jordan. From what I've read there's hundreds of thousands of families living in tents with inadequate infrastructure: no running water, heating, etc. The heath conditions of refugees in Mexico on the southern border are atrocious as well. Who is looking out for these vulnerable populations? I can only begin to imagine how quickly something like this will spread in those conditions."
2020-02-27 16:09,"The virus originated in China. Travelers to and from China contracted the virus there and consequently spread it to others at various points across the globe. Travelers have put themselves and everyone else at risk.

Here’s an idea:  Stop traveling! Stay in your own countries for the foreseeable future. Is that so difficult?"
2020-02-27 16:06,"In South Korea, the number of covid-19 infections have jumped from double digits to over 1600 for the past week. Over half of the infected cases are tied to the members of the religious group called Shincheongji Church of Jesus. The founder is Lee Man-hee who established the church in 1984. He claims himself to be the second coming of Jesus Christ. They are regarded as a secretive cult (over 200.000. members)t by local community. They have bible study group established in Wuhan and many other cities in South Korea. Mr. Lee now claims the health officials use covid-19 infection to bring down their church.

Rush Limbaugh spun his conspiracy theory and told his listeners via his broadcast that CDC used the covid-19 outbreak to bring down Donald Trump. 

The similarity of the languages and scenario used by these two groups are unbelievable. As we all know, the aftermath of any cult is not good."
2020-02-27 17:37,"I always knew the anti-meritocratic corrupt chinese communist party was going to destroy the world. If it wasn't from corrupted steel, tainted food, destruction of coral reefs, it was bound to be something. A horrifying thought: instead of granting their scientists and academics more freedom of speech, they might just shackle them to though control police indefinitely. Party loyalty over truth every dystopian day (and this could apply to the GOP soon if they don't wake up)."
2020-02-27 17:43,"Our nation, apart from the world, is entering dire straights. We can not expect an administration averse to even basic grade school science and biology to protect us from an impending threat they don't know how to address, except for our learned scientists and doctors they would filter and censore. Therefore the nation must quickly establish a network, redundant to any existing one, for communications and reporting. I would anticipate not only incompetent political leadership, but even hiding of important news medicine needs. Do not rely on government political leadership. Set up extensive networks of communication, and please do not depend on Television. This paper very smartly has taken the step to promote awareness with the virus all should sign up for. Thank you."
2020-02-27 17:33,"With “acting” administrators/directors in all too many positions, reductions in funding proposed and already in effect, and very little information as to how the virus is transmitted, and Pence in command, it might be a lot premature to unfurl the “Mission Accomplished” banner..."
2020-02-27 17:35,trump be should thanking all the deities that so many people who are fighting this pandemic are smarter then him. I’m sure he’ll take credit for its eventual vaccine.
2020-02-27 17:58,"Airborne transmission includes two different categories. First is the droplet associated transmission.  This form is associated with a cough and spraying of virus contaminated droplets into the atmosphere. The area of contagiousness may be up to 30 feet. 

The second form is airborne transmission which is different than droplet transmission. Just breathing can contaminate the atmosphere around an infected patient. The virus apparently just floats in the atmosphere and can remain suspended for days or more. Given that the wind could potentially spread the airborne particles over wide areas, this form of transmission is the most worrisome and is the most difficult to control. 

The case in California with an unknown source raises this concern and is alarming."
2020-02-27 18:06,"Why is it that Republican political leaders always view themselves as smarter than engineers, doctors, business people, and every other profession?

I just read the article about Pence requiring all government information to be cleared by him.

Disaster is now lurking unless the health profession takes the lead on networking and public awareness."
2020-02-27 18:30,"I'm a retired physician and aspects of this is similar to the problem with HIV-Aids.  I wasn't able to test patients for HIV as it was not treated like any other STD.  Patient's were hesitant to consent to test for fear of the diagnosis.  Other STD's I could test for without prior consent, just like ordering a CBC.  

Coronavirus similarly has testing roadblocks.  Either the test is not widely available, not accurate with false negatives or positives, or symptoms don't meet CDC's testing criteria.  So what are physicians and hospitals supposed to do?   Re-think criteria for COVID-19.

Treat every patient with flu/uri symptoms as though they have coronavirus until a test reveals otherwise.
The California case didn't meet CDC requirement to test so now hospital staff and possibly other patients are now potentially infected.  

Politicization of this virus will lead to needless deaths.  The medical community should take the lead on this, not the Trump administration.  The danger is that concerns about the economy and markets will minimize the need for the science to control this outbreak.  Once that's controlled, the economy will bounce back quickly."
2020-02-27 18:35,"My biggest concern is that the President is more concerned with his re-election campaign that the safety of the citizens of the USA. It helpful that he has put it in Mr Pence hand's (so he can use him as  a fall guy) but at least Pence is rational. 

The effort to control information about the Virus seems more to limit his liability  and damage control in the economy.   If information is to supplied to doctors and state/local governments in a timely manner if could delay response. Which will allow the virus to spread as it did in China in the first three weeks. 

This is a key test for the President that he puts the country ahead of his own personal interests."
2020-02-27 18:48,"Two clear tests of whether Trump can lead in a crisis:

1. Will Trump allow Dr. Birx to do her job without interference?

If I were a republican, this would be the last straw. The stock market is not uber alles when we face a nonpartisan challenge. 

The moment trump starts blaming the left: ""The stock market is down because there was a Democratic candidate's debate"" would be the moment I realize the president's values are skewed, to say the least.

In fact, there's NO REASON to believe that trump won't throw yet another American institution under the bus to create a new enemy to insulate himself: The CDC is infiltrated with never-trumpers! just like the entire FBI, CIA, DOJ, State Department, Congress and everyone NOT in the president's inner circle.

trumpies, you've told us that trump cannot be questioned, and is the source of all truth now. In fact, you've told us you believe everyone to your left is out to destroy your poor dearleader. Will you now do so again, against a virus that knows no party? 

As the stock markets react, and nations gird, trump cares only about his profits and propping up his pretense of economic prowess. He's using his tired howl about being a victim. What a leader....Ugh.

Beware trump's bloated ego! He will securely squat in his germophobe's purified air system while we fight each other in the streets for basic healthcare."

Of course.. he always licks Trumps boots.. so he is a perfect choice by Trump standards."
2020-02-27 18:09,So the new California case is in Solano County which is where many people from the Diamond Princess with the virus were also quarantined (at Travis AFB).

If the most ardent Trump supporters believe Trump's and Rush Limbaugh's lies down playing the risks of the Coronavirus and NOT trust the CDC to take pro active precautions, will more of them die as a result of their ignorance?

Ignorance may be bliss, but with respect to the Covid 19 (Coronavirus), it can be deadly."
2020-02-27 18:41,"In 1348-9 close to 40% of all Europeans died due to the Black Death. Survivors were said to kill cats because superstition and abject fear fed the rumor that cats were evil, causing the pandemic. Cats killed rats, rats carried the fleas that harbored the Yersinia pestis bacteria. Result: The plague was worse than it could have been. 

Now Trump places science ignorant Mike Penske to head up the country’s already three week tardy Coronavirus response.  Result: Pretty much the same.  “Bring out your dead” will lose it’s Monty Python comedic overtone.

Coronavirus doesn’t frighten me as much as the actions of frightened humans."

2020-02-27 18:15,"I would argue that information from authoritarian countries is pretty useless and since the vast majority of countries are authoritarian, there is little chance we will know anything accurate about this until after it is over. 

 The people who elected the cruel authoritarians of the world were intending to do harm and that is why they should expect their leaders to do more harm than good, because that is what they were hired to do. 

I still like that Trump's actions hit hardest on his base. They are incredible people who have a massive ability to absorb the results of their poor decisions without waking from the cult message. It's quite impressive and I love watching it."
2020-02-27 18:31,Yet what should be an ominous and inauspicious sign is that health officials must now clear their messaging through VP Pence.  This could very likely put us more at risk if Trump's intentions are to block and suppress the facts and truth from us.  Make no mistake that the bottom line for DJT is Wall Street and high finance.  His concern is with the recent drops in the market and his fellow oligarchs' profits.

Now, with Mike Pence at the helm, we can only hope for the same. Parallel sources of information - one factual, one farcical - same old story but this time real, quantifiable lives are stake.

The rich people will continue to hoard on supplies and prep for the worst while claiming nothing is wrong to a normal, middle class american.

If China is living a 1984-esque world, we are living in a brave new world."
2020-02-27 18:16,"With fear and uncertainty about the future looming in the public and now affecting the economy, the worst thing that could have been done was to appoint a political man over a doctor to oversee the government response and public education. This will be seen as a sign of obscuring the truth the public is already smart enough to understand. Appointing Pence, a political figure, to control a scientific event will spook the nations economic leaders as it has. In order to assure a competent oversight, Pence must act as presenter of news and information, not suppressor."
2020-02-27 18:03,"Pence’s move to have all coronavirus announcements flow through him smacks of trying to muzzle those who might blurt out truth that is contrary to the administration’s version.

2020-02-27 19:00,"While Trump has zero credibility for me and many people, he is right that we should remain as calm as possible and not spread panic along withe virus. 

I think it is fairly reasonable to assume that the virus is already here in our big cities, and owing to luck, decent hygiene, and more time because of our distance from China, we have not seen any reported deaths--yet. Of course we have not been testing for it, except with the most sick patients. If testing were more routine, I suspect we would see a lot more mild cases, those 80% of cases that self-heal. Testing mild sicknesses might provide more data for tracking, but also create more panic and the need for quarantines and work and school closures. It is a hard balance. We do know that vulnerable populations should be the most vigilant and those of us, healthy otherwise, with mild flu and cold-like symptoms, which likely aren't CV19, should be especially hygienic and mindful of our potential to unwittingly spread our mild illnesses. Unfortunately this uncertainty could be with us for 3-6 months or more."

It's like asking how a rumor gets started and spreads.  Calling two cases otherwise a ""mystery"" sounds sensationalized and alarming.  They are neither.  It is normal (in finite math), assuming it is accurate.  What is more of a mystery is how the story broke, and who is benefiting (other than short sellers) in the political economy."

He can not manipulate the narrative. And the outcome of this virus on our society will be a challenge for him. He can’t pretend it’s all fine. He got rid of the in place departments that Obama set up to deal with this very scenario. And when people die that will be on his head. We all knew something would come along that he could not handle. He is clueless and Americans are the ones that will suffer because of his cluelessness. And the GOP will be to blame too, after looking the other way on his ignorance and his crimes.  No confidence in him is already crashing the Market. He put Pence in charge so he has a scapegoat. But Trump will be the person responsible... he has gutted Science in our gov’t. So sad when we allow someone so incompetent and ignorant to be our leader. Lord help us all."

Everyone who knows about flu (and I guess the Corona virus is similar in its transmission) knows that most infections happen through finger touching to mouth, nose, eyes. 

It’s simple math: the pole in the subway you get hold has been touched by a thousand people in a single day. How many people do you encounter coughing in less than 6 feet distance? (The distance the virus supposedly is able to travel through air). Maybe 1 or 2 a day? (Unless you are a doctor...)

Having said that: simple cotton gloves do the job. Better than any sanitizer liquid.
Maybe there is some general education needed...
Even in the NYTimes I hardly have read about the microbiology and path of infection of the virus. A bit more background ratio would be great beyond all the “body count”"

The recent patient in California with no known contacts to infected people was refused testing in spite of doctors' recommendations because the ""case did not meet federal guidelines.""

The ONLY reason for such guidelines is that there are  not enough test kits to adequately identify people who have COVID-19 infections!  That likelihood has been whispered in the background but not admitted by the Administration.

The President in yesterday's press conference should have described that limitation and explained just exactly how he was going to fix it.

If the CEO of a public corporation was found to have covered up  such a key limitation he'd be gone as soon as the information was uncovered. (Trump is an experienced businessman, right? Ho Ho Ho.)

Mike Pence will filter information to make Trump look good and not to inform the American people.  So we'll have to rely on leaks and whistleblowers (traitors according to Trump) and information from Europe if we are to get the truth about OUR health and how our taxes are being spent."

This goes beyond mere censorship, beyond the usual national-security gag orders - Trump is asserting his power in order to deceive the public on a life-or-death issue.  Censorship of science has of course been on the menu since 2016 (e.g., no government entity being able to write or utter the words ""climate change"") but this is far more immediately dangerous.  We are now living in a truly dystopian country."

Everyone really just has to be prepared to act on their own. Get supplies. Start minimizing contact with people in public. Wash your hands. Isolate yourself as much as possible if you have respiratory symptoms. 

Testing is overrated if we are no longer able to trace the path of the disease and unable or unwilling to implement effective quarantines. Focus on treatment and prevention resources, not testing.

It's difficult to not have reliable data to help inform decisions about going to school, or going on domestic travel. Unfortunately we are just going to have to live with uncertainty on that."

But 2700 is 3.4% of 78,587.  That's a high mortality rate.

Where did 2.3% come from?"
2020-02-27 21:07,"I'm impressed with some of the public health measures being undertaken near me, in the UK. Local health authorities have plenty of flexibility for local solutions - the NHS is not inevitably some Soviet style monolith.

In one of the London boroughs, people concerned they might be infected phone a helpline and if, on the basis of a questionnaire protocol, they appear at risk, they attend a 'drive-in' testing centre where test samples are taken. They then have to self-isolate for a maximum of 48hrs by which time, their test result will be available. You can only do this if you have access to a car - I guess the ideas are firstly to identify high risk cases appropriate to testing, secondly to ensure that the ID details of all potential infectious cases can be recorded and finally to prevent people travelling to the test centre on foot or by public transport whilst spreading Covid-19. The majority of the urban population should qualify.

This seems quite a sensible, practical plan which might work elsewhere, too."

Bottom line coronavirus infection though novel is not much worse than at the  flu. Caution is warrant but public Hysteria due to media coverage is uncalled for. Finally, I am disgusted by how many journalists and readers blame Trump for the situation or mention him in articles responses related to the disease.  This is exactly why the leftist will be defeated with a landslide in 2020 when Trump will be re-elected as POTUS."
2020-02-27 20:52,"Thank you New York Times for your reportage.  Frankly, this is a service to which governments globally should be engaged in performing and producing. 

Rumors are dangerous.  But I will say that a commentor on the NYT online reported that her sister who works at an San Francisco Hospital, San Francisco, California, probably as a lower level staff member, claims that there is a patient in that hospital testing positive for the Coronovirus.  

Then there is the public data that someone in California has the virus but that individual claims NOT to have traveled anywhere, recently. And so that persons claims make it impossible to determine how he or she became infected. 

What I have to say, is that people lie to doctors.  Doubtelessly the person who claims to have not traveled recently probably did not but she or him came into contact with someone who has.  And that is the issue.  The person carrying the disease is out there somewhere. 

And that brings into focus cultural norms which can lead to conflict.  

There are groups of cultures in SF and San Jose but truly SF who are not cooperative with the government.  They are long time residents but refuse to adopt English, or become secure in their ability to speak and read English. 

Instead of declaring an emergency in SF, as the mayor did, I think, an all out media campaign to reach people in multiple languages informing all residents/visitors/ guests/citizens etc. of the Coronavirus and the nature of virus is necessary."

The Washington Post reported today:  ""The worst HIV outbreak in [Indiana's] history happened on his watch in 2015, which critics blamed on Pence’s belated response and his opposition to authorizing a needle-exchange program.

""In 2011, as a member of Congress, he voted to cut funding for Planned Parenthood. Two years later, a Planned Parenthood clinic that had been the only HIV-testing center in Scott County, Ind., closed after public health spending cuts.  'I don’t believe effective anti-drug policy involves handing out drug paraphernalia,' he told the Indianapolis Star at the time. Despite assurances from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that [needle-exchange] is an effective way to halt the spread of infections and diseases such as HIV, Pence said if state lawmakers tried to send him a bill for a needle-exchange program, he would veto it.

""As cases spiked, Pence reportedly turned to prayer. 

""In 2018, researchers at Yale University found the epidemic could have been prevented"" if Pence had timely enacted a clean needle program.  His inaction caused the deaths of 159 people, according to a Yale University research study.

Pence sure does have a ""knack"" for the job he's just been given by Trump."
2020-02-27 21:16,"By effectively silencing experts, making all expert information regarding this coronavirus have to go through Pence, who shares the president’s distrust of science, the administration has pretty much guaranteed a catastrophe.  When all goes wrong, which looks more and more likely, and we face major disruption and many deaths and Americans point fingers at the government’s response, Trump will say he did nothing wrong and blame Pence (never mind that he gave the task of managing this crisis to Pence).  He then has an excuse to fire Pence, which will get broad public support, and which he is rumored to want to do anyway.  That clears the way for Nikki Haley or Ivanka to be named Vice President in time for the election.  This scenario is how I make sense of Trump’s appointment of Pence, who up to this point has done little other than stand behind Trump with an inscrutable expression on his face."

Covid19 appears to be mild at this stage, but it is now rampant in the middle east where they had outbreaks of Mers (and of course the worldwide incidence of SARS). What is the chance that these relatives of the present virus might be present in a dormant stage in people and cause this mild virus to recombine into something horrible? Also since it is zoonotic, what is the chance it can now readily jump into pets, farm animals, poultry etc. In other words exactly how jumpy is it?"

The deaths themselves would mean nothing to him.

What matters to him is the stock market because the continuation of his Presidency now almost totally depends on it.

When Trump came along, businesses and many well-to-do people saw a con- artist who would give them lower taxes; was promising to spend lavishly on the military and the infrastructure; had no interest in controlling budget deficits and inflation; would cast a cold eye on the need for health and safety measures in the workplace; and would ignore the effects of climate change.

Well, the chickens have come home to roost; and what he and Americans foolish enough to believe in his methods have succeeded in producing are vastly overheated stock prices that -- to the surprise of no one familiar with the ups and downs of the stock market -- are now collapsing.

The coronavirus is guilty of nothing more than being a virus.

2020-02-27 16:17,"The key question: Is the Wuhan corona virus (with all its sanitized pc aliases) highly transmissible because of spontaneous mutation or because of human bioengineering?  

Some epidemiologists are surprised that the new virus has four new features that greatly (and suddenly) enhance its transmissibility to human hosts.  As we know natural evolution is gradual. New features are being added slowly by nature.

From Wikipedia: “The capacity to infect host cells or tissues is a necessary requirement for all applied uses of genetically modified viruses. However, a capacity for viral transmission (the transfer of infections between host individuals), is either not required or is considered undesirable for most applications. Only in a small minority of proposed uses is viral transmission considered necessary or desirable, an example is transmissible vaccines. This is because transmissibility considerably complicates to efforts monitor, control, or contain the spread of viruses.”"

The article says:

Quote:
The White House moved on Thursday to tighten control of coronavirus messaging by government health officials and scientists, directing them to clear all statements and public appearance with the office of Vice President Mike Pence, according to several officials familiar with the new approach.
...
Officials insist the goal is not to control the content of what subject-matter experts and other officials are saying, but to make sure their efforts are being coordinated, after days of confusion with various administration officials showing up on television.
...
The vice president’s first move appeared to be aimed at preventing the kind of contradictory statements from White House officials and top government health officials that have plagued the administration’s response.  ...
End quote

This sounds to me like the Trump administration is more concerned with “shaping” the public comments than with allowing the medical experts to “call it as they see it.”

If the messaging has to go through Pence, I will bet that it will go past Donnie’s desk before it is released.

Other than that, there was a lot of confused statements and misleading information. Trump tried to blame the stock market's recent performance on the Democratic candidates, called Nancy Pelosi incompetent, gloated about his approval ratings, mocked Chuck Schumer and mimicked his NY accent, kept downplaying the seriousness of COVID-19 by comparing it to the flu, rambled on about how frequently he washes his hands, lied about the mortality rate and disputed the 2% figure, claimed (without evidence) that his travel restrictions has successfully stopped the virus from spreading to the U.S., whined about being called a racist, and could not give a coherent reason for appointing Mike Pence to coordinate his administration's response to this.

This is particularly true in light of Trump’s statements suggesting that there is a conspiracy involving the news media and scientific experts to “weaponize” scientific information regarding the pandemic to hurt him politically.  Further, the administrator who reported the HHS employees’ failure to follow quarantine protection procedures has found it necessary to file a whistle blower report after action was taken to remove her from her position. (Note that the ‘unexplained’ case of Covid-19 occurred near Travis Air Force Base, one of the two quarantine sites where untrained HHS employees violated the integrity of the quarantine.) 

There is no doubt that Trump cares more about protecting his political position than he does about protecting the American people from an epidemic with the potential to kill hundreds of thousands.  Congress should take action to insure that critical scientific information is not suppressed.  Will Mitch McConnell allow that, or will he stand with the Administration, and against the American people?"

That we would have to call ahead and make an special appointment and they would have to get approval from the CDC and only if we had traveled to China.

It's a joke.

Perhaps naively but I am no longer that worried about this. Sounds like 20% of KNOWN cases are acute and I really believe there must be many UNKNOWN. If you look at the Diamond Princess, many people were asymptomatic and remained that way when diagnosed.

How many more than that will get the coronavirus?

Is it already too late to contain the coronavirus?

The death rate from the coronavirus is somewhere between one and two percent (1.0% - 2.0%).

Couple this statement with the fact that we simply are not testing anyone who does not fit a very restricted set of criteria, and it is highly likely that this virus has already spread widely in the community. 

The administration's unduly restrictive limit on who can be tested has artificially suppressed the number of cases reported in the US. The patient in Northern California had to have contracted the virus from someone else in the community. That patient and the person from whom she contracted the virus all had multiple contacts with other people in the community. None of these people walking into their doctor's office would satisfy the criteria for having a test.

So, an untold number of people with mild cases are out there unknowingly spreading this highly contagious virus to multiple people. Once the testing catches up (or the number of seriously ill patients start piling up), the number of cases in the US will skyrocket."

It uses the tactics of corruption, coercion and covert operations to undermine democratic processes such as elections. Through its control of the narrative about China, it seeks to silence truth tellers, critics and whistleblowers. It also mobilizes Chinese students in foreign universities to demonstrate, sometimes violently, against independence and religious movements opposed to Beijing - Taiwan, Tibet, Falun Gong or Falun Dafa, etc.  Author Clive Hamilton (“Silent Invasion”) wrote extensively about these influence campaigns around the world, but especially in Australia.  Any legitimate critique of China is distorted by accusations of prejudice and racism. This will be hard to twist if the critique comes from mainland Chinese.

“A new paper by Chinese researchers claims to provide further evidence that the deadly new coronavirus may not have originated in a seafood market in the city of Wuhan.

Co-authored by researchers from three Chinese institutions including the Chinese Academy of Sciences and published Friday on the distribution platform ChinaXiv, the study attempts to trace how the virus emerged and evolved.

The data suggest that “the SARS-CoV-2 source at the … market was imported from elsewhere,” researchers say.

The paper follows on the heels of research published last month in the well-known medical journal The Lancet challenging the hypothesis that the virus emerged at the Wuhan market. That paper analyzed 41 infected patients whose cases dated as far back as Dec. 1 and concluded that 13 of them had no links to the marketplace.” Source: ChinaXiv, a Chinese open repository for scientific researchers

In 2018, the Trump administration fired the government’s entire pandemic response chain of command, including the White House management infrastructure.

In May 2018, Trump ordered the NSC’s entire global health security unit shut down, calling for reassignment of Rear Adm. Timothy Ziemer and dissolution of his team inside the agency. 

The month before, then-White House National Security Advisor John Bolton pressured Ziemer’s DHS counterpart, Tom Bossert, to resign along with his team. 

Neither the NSC nor DHS epidemic teams have been replaced. 

The global health section of the CDC was so drastically cut in 2018 that much of its staff was laid off and the number of countries it was working in was reduced from 49 to merely 10. 

Meanwhile, throughout 2018, the U.S. Agency for International Development and its director, Mark Green, came repeatedly under fire from both the White House and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. 

And though Congress has so far managed to block Trump administration plans to cut the U.S. Public Health Service Commissioned Corps by 40%, the disease-fighting cadres have steadily eroded as retiring officers go unreplaced.

Trump Will Make The Coronavirus Great Again !"
2020-02-26 13:50,"This is your headline

“Beijing is pushing tales of perseverance, but many young people are openly questioning the Communist Party’s message.”

Let me change it to also - 

“The US  is pushing tales of perseverance, but many young people are openly questioning the Capitalist Party’s message.”

- A new Yale Study shows Medicare for All will prevent 68,000 unnecessary deaths and will save $450 billion - each and every year
- 530,000 bankruptcies in 2019 from healthcare debt
- 500,000 people are sleeping out on the streets today
- The wealthiest three families now own more wealth than the bottom half of the country

We are being told the Corona virus will arrive here. Yes the US is the best in the world in health care if you are wealthy. Millions without insurance or junk insurance have learned to tough it out if they get sick. A person is not going to the doctor if their family faces bankruptcy. This is why the virus will spread here, since we care more about tax breaks and funding never ending wars than helping our people."
2020-02-26 12:50,"When you look at some of the CCP propaganda, they talk to the people of China like they're children. The dictators of China have treated their people that way for 2000 years. The Emperors were dictators, yes, and life was never ever particularly ""glorious"" for China's masses, despite what the government likes to say.
.
This notion of dictatorships, controlling society, died a natural death over the past few centuries around most of the globe. It's going to go away one day in China too. The notion, held out by the Communists, that the people of China aren't ready for self determination is absurd. They're as ready as people in the West. May the day come soon."
2020-02-26 13:23,"Absolute power corrupts absolutely – someone has said.

The corrollary is that absolute false information turns folks into absolute non believers.

We in America always wondered what's the limit to which an average Chinese will put up with government heavy hand.

Well, it appears they have met that heavy hand _and they don't like it one bit.

I think – Reagan had famously said that internet, wifi revolution will bring down the iron curtain.

The Chinese –thru their efforts are bringing down their equivalent bamboo curtain.

The Chinese government made much of WSJ op-ed with it's headline –” the Dying man in China” or something to that effect.

The dying man in China is the propaganda machine – and I think that's good for the Chinese and the world."
2020-02-26 13:28,"Coronavirus may be the thing that finally disrupts the Trump/Fox News/Talk radio propaganda machine.  We have been warned that his is going to affect the US, and very possibly disrupt daily life.  All Trump is worried about is himself, as usual.  His ""administration"" took an ax to the agency that handles pandemic response.  Wake up, people.  He doesn't care."
2020-02-26 13:28,"“The official media,” Ms. Zhao said, “has lost a lot of credibility.”

It never was credible.  It was and is propaganda and the Chinese people live in a stifling autocratic country."
2020-02-26 14:10,"The strength of a democracy is not that it is more efficient than an authoritarian regime.  It's strength and value come from the fact that it provides a safety valve in times of crisis.  Democracies allow dissenters to warn society when danger threatens and can push alternative ideas when the power structure is mired in bad policy.  When authoritarian regimes suppress dissent, they are also suppressing potential solutions in a time of crisis.  While all of this could be expected from China's authoritarian government there are ominous signs that Trump will try to treat the coming pandemic as a PR problem rather than a medical crisis.  If he does a lot of people will die from the resulting policy and logistics blunders as the disease spreads."
2020-02-26 14:21,"I have seen some truly heartbreaking Chinese videos on-line.  People being forced into quarantine.  One poor woman clearly risking her life by going public cried in frustration how ordinary people like her family would not be able to receive care.

It's hard to imagine these videos surfacing under normal circumstances.  The Chinese government has lost control to some extent."
2020-02-26 14:28,"The US should be prepared for itself, instead of criticizing China. My family and friends are still staying home safe in Xiaogan, 30 miles from Wuhan. Through them I understand how the whole nation of China is making a coordinated action against the COVID-19. Actually people related to the communist party are the majority working on the battlefront. One of my cousin's husband who work in the government has been working continuously for a month and seldom had a six-hour sleep. They also deliver food and vegetable once per week to every community in Xiaogan. All the people I know apparently support the action and endure self quarantining and working from home.  

Indeed there are many sacrifices by countless doctors, soldiers and public service working closely with the patients. Many of them get infected and died. However, the spread of images with people dead from the virus explains nothing about the government's legitimacy, but it merely adds to horror. Without dying, without the many more being saved.   
Without the coordinated actions, the quarantine of more than half China's population, and the huge economical sacrifice that China has made to stop its big engine, the virus could have infected many more people around the world.  
Better read the news from WHO's delegate to China for facts. 
Now it is the time when, not if, the virus spreads in the US. So the US should better prepare for a hard task to defend people's health that could be as challenging as China is facing."
2020-02-26 14:46,"I am no China hater, I’ve been there many times and love the country and the people;

However the Chinese government is a control freak. I’d be extremely sceptical that the number of infections is as low as they make out. Looking how quickly this has spread in South Korea, Italy and even Iran (whom also censor information heavily) I’d be very surprised that only 70k from 11m residents of Wuhan are infected. Looking anecdotally at pieces like this, seeing hospitals literally bursting seems to back this up. 

I don’t doubt their sincerity and determination to defeat the virus but the figures over the last few days seem to too perfectly fit the narrative; cases & deaths are dropping each day, the infections are limited to Hubei. The government has to justify the tough measures they are putting in place by showing progress, in for one doubt those figures. 

PS there’s a good piece in The Economist that statistically compares mortality rates in outbreaks between open democracies and authoritarian states, open societies have significantly less deaths due to the open flow of information."
2020-02-26 14:47,"I think that the NYT is really pushing this idea that China is close to collapse. That seems highly unlikely and it certainly speaks to a weird kind of hopeful thinking on the part of the Western media. China is dealing with an unprecedented crisis. It has definitely made mistakes, but mistakes that have been mirrored by many other governments in the past. China's handling of the crisis has been reasonably competent and is getting increasingly so. When this is all over, the Chinese government will still be there. Wishing it away is not enough to make it collapse."
2020-02-26 14:52,"It's clear even from this story it's not just ""young"" people questioning Beijing's propaganda push. Chinese of all ages are pushing back and it's the older people who have the institutional memory to provide this push back a very necessary context and God forbid judgement. Also ""middle aged"" and ""old"" people in China are far more active with social media than their Western counterparts. Hence China's successe in rolling out things like electronic payments. 
For all the money and resources the NYT invests in its China coverage it still doesn't understand the country very well or it's culture. You can't use a Western template in analyzing the Middle Kingdom.
""Young"" people are not going to bring about change in China. It's  the ""middle aged"" and ""older"" segments of the population that will ultimately make that call.
Here's a tip. Once Beijing loses the ""Da Ma"" (Big Mothers) a term roughly equivalent to ""Aunties"" that refers to the huge cohort of Chinese middle aged to older women who often play an outsize role in their extended families and exert equal parts resented and welcome influence on the younger members of their families - all bets are off. 
Continued stable improvement in quality of life and security for their families without too much annoying intrusion by a competent government is their measuring standard.
If the Coronavirus exposes the current government as incapable of continuing to achieve these goals - the ""Da Ma"" will, in large part, determine its fate."
2020-02-26 14:07,"There are a few brave souls willing to say the truth about what is going on in China. They know the government lies about everything and this virus is an example. This is one of several reasons one should not believe what the government says about the number and distribution of those infected especially now that the government is pushing so hard to get factories back up and running ASAP.

Take note that the government is not saying anything further about about infections in prisons or in the far west where in truth at least two million muslims are being held in camps. There are several social media posts that say infections have spread there. Nothing from the government that does not want any information to escape from those prisons and camps.

In a society where the government will always lie about everything we should be careful about what we should believe about the coronavirus in China."
2020-02-26 14:35,"We have a president who's telling us all is well, which is reason enough to panic. His administration's chief concern seems to be how the corona virus affects the stock market and will do its utmost not to rattle Wall Street, even if it means dispensing a torrent of lies. I'll be curious to see how our state propaganda machine, Fox News, handles this, though there's little doubt in my mind."
2020-02-26 14:21,"So typical of Li Yuan and NY Times to push negative stories about China in the all out China-Bashing regime with bipartisan support across American politics. 

Let's see how Americans react as Covir-19 arrives in USA, not that Canadian really want to see it. As the saying goes, when USA sneezes Canada get a cold. Canada-USA border is too porous, as big Canadian cities see sharp increase in gun violence in recent years as guns are sneaked north."
2020-02-26 14:27,"We need to refrain from smugness and feeling superior. Just imagine how most of Red State America would, and WILL respond to an outbreak.

2020-02-26 15:50,"Today is the first time there are more (daily) newly infected cases outside of China than inside.  Even inside China, excluding Hubei province, the newly infected cases are in the teens.  The data speaks itself: despite initial stumbling, Beijing is beating this thing.  Let’s hope this is the start of new dawn even when the rest of world just stepped into the night."
2020-02-26 14:11,"It's bizarre to read so many NYT comments defending the integrity of the Communist Party on so many articles amidst the fiasco that is this the COVID-19 epidemic (possibly pandemic). I don't know whether the party has that many online propaganda trolls or NYT subscribers are that are that passionate in their anti-Trump whataboutism, but it's all rather beside the point, no?

China deserves criticism for its handling of the disease's spread and the conditions that allowed it to take root in the first place, not to mention its draconian policies suppressing dissent. NYT is right to highlight the weaknesses of their totalitarian ethno nationalist state in handling this public health crisis, regardless of our broader feelings of the Trump administration."
2020-02-26 14:13,"What might happen if the Xi virus infects China's leadership, and even Xi himself?"
2020-02-26 14:14,China's communism should die; Xi Jinping should be ousted; China should own the Coronavirus and do not protect its borders against the virus that it created. Chjna should be ashamed of itself for creating the coronavirus and not learning from the SARS virus outbreak.  China should apologize to other countries for exporting the Coronavirus.
2020-02-26 12:04,"China Daily provides an interesting look through the Communist looking glass. Over the past month the Party has been walking back their official position on an almost daily basis even as the articles are full of the Marxist rhetoric of struggle, solidarity, war and victory.

Here's one from February 11:

Wuhan is a heroic city, and the people of Hubei and Wuhan are heroic people who have never been crushed by any difficulty and danger in history.

If Wuhan wins the battle against the virus, Hubei will. If Hubei wins the battle, the nation will.

We can certainly obtain a full victory in the fight against the epidemic.

Close attention must be paid to employment and large scale layoffs should be avoided.

The fundamentals of China's long-term economic development remain unchanged and the impact of the novel coronavirus epidemic on the economy is short lived.

Thus, Please hurry up with préparations in your countries. No, you are not prepared.

That is a western media interpretation of the ""deal"".  The actual deal is: the Communist Party is in charge.  Period.  If you complain, we will get you, your family, your friends, and your community.

Democracy, with all of its flaws, is the best form of government. The Chinese people are incredibly frightened by the thugs ruling them, and, possibly, even more frightened to be the masters of their own destiny.  I recommend that they give democracy a try.  This could be the Asian Spring; the destiny of the Chinese people should be in the hands of the Chinese people, not in the hands of the ruling thugs."

Let's see how well our superior system of government deals with crisis when it explodes on our shores in a few weeks.  Only yesterday, our President condemned the CDC for rattling the stock market.

2020-02-26 16:55,"This article points out the fundamental way that Chinese regimes through history have behaved- and how they have failed. Their focus has been to present an aura of benevolent authoritarianism that will ensure the best life possible for the citizen as long as that person obeys the rules. If there seems to be significant discontent growing then a stern crackdown is necessary to remind the population that the regime is in charge and undermine any possibility of rebellion before it becomes a threat. 

What eventually happens however is that the inconsistencies catch up and the people become disillusioned with the now not so benevolent authority in some crisis or another. It has been happening in Hong Kong with its long history of relative freedom of expression and this present situation is an example of the kind of event that could, someday, bring it to the mainland. Xi will lose his control if he has too many more failures because the Communist Party does not want to lose its control."

This is true with Trump (and increasingly his Republican sycophants) on a wide range of topics ranging from Corona virus to Russian interference in elections, the Ukraine ""investigations"", to climate change, among other things.

2020-02-26 17:25,"I don't have much to add. I just want to point out what I think is a flaw in logic in most critics' comments on China. We currently do not know how many people are infected in Iran, Japan, S Korea, and even the United States. The scientific method of determining whether someone is infected or not has basically a 50% chance of getting it right. You can be infected without showing symptoms. You can be infected even if you don't test positive. At this point, if we asked Japan, South Korea, and Iran to tell us how many people are infected, do you think they could give us an accurate number? The best we can get is an educated guess. Currently, news about those countries tell us the number of people doctors have diagnosed. 
In reality, China has done the same, but somehow we give their government a double standard. We continue to criticize China for lying and hiding infected #s but a method of actually knowing those numbers doesn't exist. 
The best thing China has done is cooperate with the WHO. The worst thing they have done is allow local government officials to hide the disease at first. But since then, Chinese health professionals have been doing their best to diagnose the infected based on clinical signs and the Chinese government has done its best to contain and prevent the spread of Covid-19. In the end, all I'm asking is to stop criticizing China for lying or hiding the facts. If you think they deserve it, just be consistent and do it to S. Korea, Japan, and the U.S. too."

China can't tell the truth about anything because lying on a grand scale is official government policy. 

It's just the way it is, or China's form of government can't be sustained. Toe the party line and you might be able to make some money and send your kid to a U.S., Canadian or Western European university.

However, if that kid were to come back and question the government on any level, the kid gets no work, or is imprisoned. 

See? This is China.

This virus is exposing the government in ways the 1989 crackdown never could. 

U.S, companies that went there for the cheap labor are now sweating out their supply chains. The markets are seeing the impact of the cutoff of all the stuff from China on the world economy.

The chaotic scene she is describing could be happening in any country where the health care system is overwhelmed. It's also natural for any government in times of crisis to try boost public morale by emphasizing on the positive. Does she prefer the Communist regime to tell its citizens that there's no cure in sight and they're all going to die?

As for the Chinese themselves, anybody who has lived in China or has Chinese relatives will tell you they are one of the most critical and undisciplined groups of people on earth. They're always complaining about this and that and will look for loopholes in laws that don't make sense to them. If it does make sense, they'll quickly fall in line with no complaints and follow the letter of the law like the quarantine. It has nothing to do with the regime loosing or tightening its gripe.

2020-02-26 19:32,"The CCP China did nothing for several months, now they have pandemic level. The way this one party system is structured, makes them highly effective at controlling and repressing its own people. Right now they are rounding people like an infested farm.

IT IS TIME TO PUSH FOR A MULTI PARTY SYSTEM IN CHINA MAINLAND."
2020-02-26 20:22,"It’s never optimal for a society when a small oligarchy is in command, monopolizing power and knowledge. As the world is now a village, any subdistrict of the village living under dictatorship is bad for the rest of the village. The Chinese dictatorship delayed the alert on the danger of the virus by at least one month relative to what would have happened if the pandemic had started in an advanced democracy.. 

Ignorance comes from not knowing facts. In the most acute form, it crystallizes itself by clinging to dogma: a rigid set of beliefs is supposed the know-all, be-all, can-all. This is what happens with any tribalism or religion, even when the religion is the cult of a leader... such as Stalin, or Xi… Or G W. Bush, invading Iraq.

Ignorance is never safe. Secrecy can rarely be justified on the part of those entrusted with power. We are a world village. Our primary objective should be to make the world safer and better for all, and that requires debating well, to find better solutions. And debating optimally requires optimal information. Also the debate gives its chance to the most unexpected ideas, the more people take part in it. This is the deepest, most fundamental reason for democracy.

The more democracy, the more a people is forced to learn to think by itself, including forced to learn how one suspects, and gathers the most important facts. Once again, it’s not just a matter of choice, national preference, but of safety of spaceship Earth we all live on."
2020-02-26 20:28,"The Chinese youths may well change their minds after they have a chance of looking how the Coronavirus spread elsewhere and the to witness  how totally unprepared the Rest of the World it to the risk of pandemic like the current pandemic.  I write this in light of yesterday's CDC announcement that the Coronavirus  will have infection cluster in US.  It is not a matter of if, but when.  A related article appears in WSJ stating that the CDC  work was delayed because the wrong test was use to detect the virus!!!"
2020-02-26 20:53,"I can't imagine there's even one western country that would have been half as efficient as China has been in trying to control this viral outbreak. Of course there were mistakes and under estimation.. and an attempt to control the narrative by downplaying its significance. But all of this - and more - would have happened too in the US.. but the actual pragmatism the Chinese have adopted and implemented, once the scale and threat become fully apparent, is far beyond anything the west could have implemented."
2020-02-26 16:57,"Does 'shadenfreude' explain the NY Times's relentless attacks on the Chinese government and system? Is the Times unable to ever write about China's successes because it wants to at least believe that our sad system, with Trump at its helm, is still better than what they have over there? 

China's response to the virus has been superb, according to the WHO. Unfortunately, to know that by reading the Times, one would have to search very hard. But one would be hard-pressed to believe the World Health Organization in the face of the Times's extensive coverage of just how poorly the Chinese are coping. 

I get it: the Chinese, in order to govern a population of 1.5 billion people, don't permit our precious free speech. OMG! 

Now: why not try looking, at least once in a while, at all the remarkable achievements and successes of the Chinese approach? 

All the news that's fit to print, indeed."

'Copy China's response to COVID-19,' WHO expert urges rest of the world
By Daniel Harries

Countries around the world need to follow China's example when fighting and preparing for COVID-19, a top World Health Organization (WHO) expert said on Tuesday upon returning from the epicenter of the outbreak. 

Describing the response as ""striking,"" Bruce Aylward, head of the joint WHO-China mission, said: ""In 30 years of doing this business, I've not seen this before, nor was I sure it would work."" ..."
2020-02-26 18:54,"The ugliest propaganda lie is that the corona virus came out of nowhere, an unpreventable fatality. We should have enough honesty to acknowledge that this virus naturally lives in covets and bats, far from humans. Maybe other wild animals are involved in the animal-human transmission chain. This pandemic can only be attributed to despicable chinese eating habits and filthy meat markets. Lets stop lying to protect the chinese society as a whole from this enormous responsibility. Conventional public hygiene measures are unquestioned. But China has been recklessly provoking pandemics since the SARS outbreak, in 18 years they have done nothing to protect us from these viruses. Is the world really the hostage of chinese food habits that don't respect wildlife nor animal dignity ? Lets openly talk and then change this, I am not ready to die for a grilled civet or a bat soup.  Lets stop this farce. Risk my life working in Wuhan ? No. China deserves our empathy only after they fix this terrible mess."
2020-02-26 18:59,"Want a preview of the Trump response to a Pandemic?  See Puerto Rico- Paper Towels for everyone.
   Seriously."
2020-02-26 19:39,"In addition to propaganda, the Chinese government puts out completely UNreliable virus figures.
Hard to trust anything coming out of China."
2020-02-26 20:08,"When a government is faced with a totally unknown highly contagious disease that is spreading very quickly among ten of missions of people in such a vast country, what should they do ?

Concerned with being blamed for ""not transplant"", ""fake news"", ""brainwashing machine"", ""a whole month of inaction"" .....?

They were probably overwhelmed with the task on hand. Not worry about other people criticism."
2020-02-26 20:18,Neither might be Trump’s.
2020-02-26 19:17,"Since Trump acts like Xi we are not any better.  Authoritarians are not sufficiently intelligent to micromanage, and are subject to gross error based on ignorance and hubris.

Why DID Trump fire our pandemic response team?"
2020-02-26 20:30,"""Coronavirus Weakens China’s Powerful Propaganda Machine"" and it will do the same to ours."
2020-02-26 19:28,"Sounds like the new generation of Chinese citizens have different ideas about how their government should be responding. Perhaps they can be a force for change in the future. Certainly the government has totally mishandled this crisis, but on our side of the globe how confident can we be that the Trump administration would do any better given their disdain for science?  Heck we have got Medal of Freedom winner Rush Limbaugh laughing off this epidemic as nothing more serious than a common cold! 

Let us hope that our scientists can find a way to handle this serious disease so that it harms less people.  Hopefully they can develop a vaccine that will put the brakes on it."
2020-02-26 19:54,"Wow!  Impressed by young, independent thinkers.  Having lived in China twice, I know of Communist Party sheepherder's 
mentality -- pacify with improved standard of living.  But this only goes so far.  Higher income, better educated.  Thus, thinking less like sheep and more like human beings, deserving of respect and dignity.  NOT good for the Party."
2020-02-26 21:19,"Perhaps the Covid-19 epidemic and foremost the initial denial of the Chinese authorities will work out similarly as the melt-down of the Chernobyl reactors in 1986. 
No regime can turn a blind eye to disasters and maintain credibility. 
Which Beijing apparatchik will be stepping up to proclaim гласность?    Glasnost as Gorbachev advocated 34 year ago, finally leading to the implosion of the Soviet Union. 

This is by the way something we in the West tend to ignore: it was denial up to the highest level that led to the downfall of the Soviet socialist dream, more than a victory of capitalism as an ideology. 

Benchmark the word glasnost or openness, esp. before Nov-20."
2020-02-26 21:26,"No one and not one media in America offer any support and help to the 70,000 Chinese people who are trapped and sick in dire need of medical, and financial support. Not one organized effort in fund raising or in helping them to procure mask and other equipments. This is chilling. Instead of doing that, we use their demise to fulfill agendas, politically or not. We should be ashamed as a long term trade partner no matter what is your political ideology."
2020-02-26 21:36,"It is interesting to see China and the US as being mirror images of each other, each side frantically preaching to its own citizens how superior their own system is better than the other by resorting to fact distortion.  I really don't see any difference in the propaganda machines between these two countries.  In the example of New York Times, when I see a positive word in its reporting on China, I have the tendency of going outside to see if the sun had risen from the west that morning."
2020-02-26 22:54,"The Chinese students in my human rights law class (I suspect some of whom were associated with the CCP) were very quick to dismiss civil and political rights as “western values.”  Liberty and individualism, they argued were over-rated and not part of “Asian values.”  I must say I found a certain hypocrisy in their arguments given that they were sitting and engaging in free debate in Australia, a western liberal-democracy (albeit less protective of freedom of expression than say, the US).  But, it did leave me wondering if Western hopes that totalitarianism would crumble in China were realistic.  Maybe the Chinese simply liked to live in a police state.  The recent protests in Hong Kong and the emergence of dissent (despite mass censorship) in the wake of the Coronavirus has suggested to me that it may not be so simple.  Maybe the Chinese aren’t so different to us, maybe they really do want freedom, they just aren’t allowed to have it.  That said, I agree with NYT commentators that how well the West responds to the Coronavirus remains to be seen."
2020-02-26 20:53,"Please stop politicizing a virus! It is outrageous.
It is distrubing to read always negative news coverage about China, regarding every aspect of everything, but no one seems to give a damn about the fact that on February 24, 2020, National People's Congress in China made an announcement: not only wild animals living in the wild are out of limit for consumption, but all wild animals that are artificially bred and farmed/raised are also out of limit for consumption going forward. I actually think China is not doing enough to have her voice heard in America. It is disturbing for Americans with Chinese heritage to face endless discrimination and belittling already. It is a virus, please stop trying to politicizing it and make it even worst for everyone. Does anyone actually care about all these people living in China! I didn't feel a shred of emphathy in the media towards these people while all of you are benefiting from these people's hard work. Look at the shoes you are wearing! Check your phone and everything in your house! They are made in China. Yes, people work hard there to make those things so that you can afford so many. They are now suffering from a virus, let's throw more rocks on them!"
2020-02-26 21:49,"The NYT spends an awful lot of time slagging China. Here we have a country that is suffering and the only thing we get is the bad stuff.
But name one other country that could mobilize such tremendous resources in such a short time? In fact, China has the best emergency management system in the world. Yes, some idiot cops sequestered and warned Dr Li WenLiang, but guess what he did? He threw his own gauntlet down again and went back to work   and die from the COVID-19 he warned about. But we haven't heard about the chief medical officer of a Wuhan hospital. Liu Zhiming, who went to the front lines and he too lost his life to the disease. Over 100 health care workers have died. 
When an American solider throws herself on a hand grenade to save the other soldiers, she is cited as a hero. So why the double-standard in the NYT at a time when China is suffering?
Instead of 100% castigation, how about the helping hand of a Good Samaritan and the quality of mercy?"
2020-02-26 21:13,That old chestnut; Fake news.
2020-02-26 21:41,"Does NYT know how to ""give it rest"" for once? Discredit discredit discredit the Chinese Communist regime. News flash NYT, pandemics are more than about politics and ideologues."
2020-02-26 22:41,There's plenty of propaganda alright. But it not coming from China. It's coming from New York.

It is sickening now that one need to worry about being labelled as part of the propaganda machine from China in order to speak up. To politicizing a virus, it is going too far!"
2020-02-26 22:04,"I see the China apologists are out in full force. Apologists are apologists...whether making excuses for China, Trump, Bloomberg, whomever/whatever. SO much hypocrisy out there."
2020-02-26 20:38,"“Many”? How many people did you ask? China has 1.4 billion people and the young people I know was not like what you said.  I wonder have this reports that write news about China actually been in China? This question was with me for really long time. Because I heard so many news about the policy,security ext that even I sometimes believe that but when I went back, none of them are truth. (Now I seriously question the western news about other countries.) So, did these report make a life by criticizing China? Then you must thanks China for that ,because without it, how you gonna make money? 
Think about that Mrs.li, you can’t help people in China to make money, or battle the virus. You can’t remove the government even though you hate it. Now you news are fake, you can’t even win in propagandas anymore."
2020-02-26 20:49,"Honestly they’re no different than the MSM here. Ours is little more subtle, but it try’s to shape public opinion politically to one side & create false narratives. Ours often blows things out of proportion or present false facts with no vetting. Truly unbiased journalism is extinct."
2020-02-26 22:56,Nelson from The Simpsons: HA HAA
2020-02-26 22:08,"""Exhausted medical workers with faces lined from hours of wearing goggles and surgical masks. Women with shaved heads, a gesture of devotion. Retirees who donate their life savings anonymously in government offices....""

All these are heroes and the Chinese people know that and I am thankful to these heroes and to all the Chinese people for the heroism being shown.

This article is shameful."
2020-02-26 22:14,"I don't see this type of news has string right cord always.

2020-02-27 0:02,We will have our chance to show our own brilliance against the coronavirus.  Much sooner that we think we will.
2020-02-27 0:33,"For 2200 years, Chinese officials have been responsible for disseminating 'propaganda,' xuānchuán, transforming the people through honorable behavior and instruction–and lectured on the Emperor’s Sacred Maxims and exemplifying them in daily life.

At the practical level, we could call xuānchuán 'best practices' as applied to agriculture, business, and even Coronavirus safety measures

At the social level, the Sacred Maxims include propaganda like ""Free yourself from enmity and anger to show respect for your body and life.""

At the political level, xuānchuán includes advice in Mao's famous Little Red Book like, ""It is necessary to criticize people's shortcomings but, in doing so, we must truly take the stand of the people and speak out of wholehearted eagerness to protect and educate them. To treat comrades like enemies is to take the stance of the enemy.""

Western propaganda has a deservedly bad reputation. Chinese, not so much.."
2020-02-27 0:34,"Western reporters look at events in China through a lens of western democracy, where leaders have to bend to public opinion.  It doesn't work that way in police states like China.  Re-reading the novel 1984 might prepare them to better understand the situation there."
2020-02-27 1:13,"On numerous occasions the World Health Organization has praised the sometimes extreme measures China has taken to prevent the spread.  The WHO stated the approach “changed the course of the virus,”  adding that the rest of the world should learn from China’s experience.  This article portrays a horrific dystopian nightmare."
2020-02-27 1:27,"This is reminiscent of that Yang hit piece in the NYT. Remember that one? A couple of former employees did not love the guy so maybe he isn't that great after all. China is facing a tremendous crisis and has pulled out all the stops in her response. And in doing so, she has bought everyone time. It is unfortunate, but there is no way that everyone can feel seen, heard and cared for in a time like this. But the truly heroic response of China's healthcare workers, the populace's acceptance of extreme sacrifice in service of containing this threat, in service of the common good, this is what it means to be human. This is the real story of this epidemic."
2020-02-27 2:26,"Don't be quick to dismiss the power of China's propaganda machine.  It's greatest victory is the co-opting of the WHO, which has now turned into an unofficial propaganda arm of the Chinese Communist Party.  Dr. Bruce Aylward yesterday at a long press conference said of China, ""The world is in your debt.""  Really?  This is the same autocratic regime that lied about the infections, delayed informing the WHO, demanded that the naming have nothing to do with China or Wuhan and continues to block Taiwan from even participating in the WHO?  This is the country the world is in debt to?  Reports continue to leak out of Wuhan that the supposed decrease in the number of reported cases is the result of hospitals underreporting cases. Yet, still supplicants of China, at the WHO, call on other countries to mimic the methods employed in the autocracy.  It will take more than a pandemic to change things in China, and I don't know what will change things outside of China where the government still wields considerable clout."

Maybe, the mainland Han Chinese who showed so little compassion for their XinJiang Uyghur Muslims they were separated from families and herded into detention centers, and forced to undergo “training” in Chinese “vocational training prisons”, might just begin to understand what its like to live in a lockdown and have all your freedom and rights stripped away.

This epidemic would have been much much worse had the Chinese did not took the drastic step to lock down Wuhan. The world should be grateful for it. 

Chinese people are smart. They deserve support from the media around the world. Instead we keep getting one sided reporting to satisfy the thirst to seeing the Chinese government to fail. These China bashers will be disappointed."
2020-02-27 2:09,"The response to the COVID-19 virus really makes clear the pros and cons of an authoritarian versus a democratic society. 

China is more successful when consensus gets in the way and less successful when consensus is necessary. The US struggles to do big initiatives quickly because every voice must be heard, but it does well when it needs many people working separately to get something done. 

So, the Chinese can do things like building multiple new hospitals within two weeks, but it can’t get people quickly helping each other across the country because all decisions must come from the top. 

The US can get a quick response from community organizations working independently at the grassroots level, but it takes forever to do big new infrastructure projects because it needs to listen to many stakeholders. 

The Chinese can shut down absurd Fake News and ruinous gossip while the Americans get inundated with lies, scams, and harassment. 

No government system and no society is perfect. China’s over control causes many problems. The USA’s worship of profit over all other values causes a different set of problems.

Frankly, I’d rather we focused on coming together to do our best to prepare to handle this new illness rather than wasting time gloating about China’s shortcomings."
2020-02-27 2:21,"Does this story remind you of similar government PR in other countries？The Chinese regime can only blame themselves, but the rest of us should keep an eye on our own government as well. The world is full of heartless  and greedy politicians. We need more concerned citizens to make sure no politicians can take our future away. Power to the people！"
2020-02-27 6:36,"Any country would struggle with this new virus. The propaganda examples in the article are absurd, but the propaganda does not seem to be making the outbreak worse. And when the Chinese people see how other countries fare with  this new virus, they will not be as bothered by their own countries struggles. Japan had issues, not propaganda ones, but logistics after its nuclear plant flooded, and the US certainly had huge difficulties with helping our people hurricanes Katrina in the southeast , and Sandy in the Northeast. 
The authoritarian system creates problems, but better to look at those that stem from its weaknesses. The problems with the virus are those that many governments would, and likely will, face."
2020-02-27 10:40,"Think the one bit about Dr. Li Wenliang's passing made people especially the younger generation realize the value of free expression is overly....optimistic. The reason most people got angry and upset was simple that Dr. Li's message somehow happened to be correct, and they thought if he was not silenced and the state media didn't opt to convey an alternative message, they wouldn't be in this mess, personally  - In other words, they didn't recognize that, even if Dr. Li's message was wrong, he shouldn't be reprimanded by the police just because he said something wrong or unpopular. They still think that the government has the right to determine which speech is considered a ""rumor"" or otherwise not allowed, criminally.   Many in the younger generation have a habit of hitting the ""report"" button whenever they see something they don't like, be it about a celebrity they adore or a statement they think is insulting to the people, the country, etc. Unfortunately, I don't think Dr. Li's passing is changing this habit."
2020-02-27 12:16,"It’s still too early to tell whether China’s Communist Party under Xi’s leadership is losing its grip on power. It is censoring the Coronavirus coverage, because the widespread outrage among concerned  citizens over the regime’s mismanagement of the COVID-19 outbreak is a thorn in the side of  the repressive state apparatus. 
Now it hopes that the virus can be contained so that the country can get back to business as usual, and that the popular discontent will subside. 
At least the Chinese propaganda machine has been less malign as the Russian. While the Communist Party offers coverage of patriotic citizens donating their life savings and other courageous acts, the Russian-linked accounts post rumours online in English, Spanish, Italian, German and French , alleging, for example, that the virus was forged in a US lab to be unleashed on the Chinese population. Bill Gates and George Soros, in some tellings, were in on the plot."

I live in Hunan providence one division down from Hubei and under similar levels of restriction and see the type of commentary mentioned alive on wife’s I phone and follow with a VPN the NYTimes coverage. People are frightened reactions expected; but the important ones are within the CCP.
To see the Big Picture as to what might politically follow an Australian Sino specialist Richard McGregor in Xi Jinping: The Backlash argues how XI ‘has left himself with a perilously narrow off-ramp from office due to his aggressive anti-corruption campaign:  “Pull down one person and you destroy hundreds if not thousands of people along with them.”
Those forces will play themselves out in coming time, but Xi’s performance may read well as the Covid-19 dwindles back to SARS levels – popular discontent of little consequence.

 We are about 6 weeks from the time of year when nature becomes the best weapon against Virus, the stronger sunshine and longer days are perfect weapons for pathogens that like dry cold weather. Right now we are playing for time, but while the window of opportunity to stop this narrows, our President plays golf and eats cheeseburgers and does absolutely nothing.
  Nero is infamous for fiddling while Rome burned. He and Trump have a lot of similarities."
2020-02-26 12:20,The world economy is going to slow dramatically for awhile. This will be a test of how well we can all come together to defeat the virus. We all must be prepared to make sacrifices to minimize the human suffering in all aspects. Scientists are racing to develop a vaccine. They must get the utmost support of all governments world wide. All nations must be united to win this war. Life is fragile. Let's recognize how interconnected the entire human race truly is and act accordingly.
2020-02-26 14:29,"Tourism in Europe is also likely  to take a hit.

My wife and I have canceled a Baltic cruise for this June because: 

1. Most cruise lines reserve the right to alter or curtail the schedule/itinerary without refunds; and cancel-for-any reason insurance will be about half the cost of the cruise. 

2. We are both over 70 and thus at higher risk of becoming seriously ill or even dying from COVID-19 if we catch it. 

3. In the best of times cruise ships are floating Petri dishes that easily spread noroviruses; note the current COVID-19 transmissions on the Diamond Princess. 

4. While our cruise ports are in countries that now have fewer than 25 cases, the coronavirus could become a pandemic affecting many countries, including those on our itinerary. Our nightmare scenario is that we or other passengers contract the disease prior to boarding the ship, aboard or in port. Do we want to be treated or quarantined on the ship or in Europe where Medicare is not accepted? No way. 

For us the medical/financial risks are just too great, so for 2020 we are planning to limit our travel to US destinations we can reach easily by car or short flights. 

Over time we will evaluate the coronavirus situation and see how cruise lines and foreign countries are coping. There’s always next year."
2020-02-26 14:50,"Please do not argue with open borders in Europe. This is not a problem regarding the virus. Every single state of the Union can put controls in place if necessary for public health. As we see such measures are usually deemed necessary for smaller entities like towns within states and are so far established without hesitation in Italy. 

Additionally please keep in mind the opposite of an open boarder is not a closed border, but a controlled border. So far the US has led in thousand and thousands of Chinese with and without US passport. The same has happened in Europe. We have no open border with China or whatsoever. 

Europe's concept of open borders do not place health risks on anybody as safety measures are not forbidden and so far taken by Austria and Switzerland (member of the Schengen Treaty not the European Union)."
2020-02-26 14:57,"It’s tough, but people have to realize that businesses and even the economy can’t come first... unless people want to maybe cause a lot more death. I just don’t understand why some people don’t understand this. Getting people back to work too early can mean they all get sick and there’s a new outbreak to contain. Idk if it’s possible, but it seems like governments need to promise assistance so companies and people can focus on limiting the spread of Sars-Cov-2 without feeling like they’ll go out of business, lose their jobs, or starve."
2020-02-26 14:08,The title of this article should state how the outbreak is affecting an Italian company.  I followed a link that said 'the spread across Europe'. I want to know what other countries have the virus.

Mark my words."
2020-02-26 13:58,"Fortunately, the USA is in the hands of a very stable genius and has nothing to worry about.

In 2018, the Trump administration fired the government’s entire pandemic response chain of command, including the White House management infrastructure.

In May 2018, Trump ordered the NSC’s entire global health security unit shut down, calling for reassignment of Rear Adm. Timothy Ziemer and dissolution of his team inside the agency. 

The month before, then-White House National Security Advisor John Bolton pressured Ziemer’s DHS counterpart, Tom Bossert, to resign along with his team. 

Neither the NSC nor DHS epidemic teams have been replaced. 

The global health section of the CDC was so drastically cut in 2018 that much of its staff was laid off and the number of countries it was working in was reduced from 49 to merely 10. 

Meanwhile, throughout 2018, the U.S. Agency for International Development and its director, Mark Green, came repeatedly under fire from both the White House and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. 

And though Congress has so far managed to block Trump administration plans to cut the U.S. Public Health Service Commissioned Corps by 40%, the disease-fighting cadres have steadily eroded as retiring officers go unreplaced.

“I think the whole situation will start working out,” Mr. Trump said during his photo op tour in India.

Everybody loves award-winning ignorance, incompetence, negligence and a total lack of preparation."
2020-02-26 14:22,"This situation speaks FAR more to the deplorable condition of human immunity in a polluted, stressed-out, unglued hyper artificial environment. ZERO mention in mass media (NY Times ... anybody home?) regarding the proven immune-boosting benefits of getting enough sleep, unplugging at night from hormone-destructive blue light generating electronic devices, and time-tested herbal support (which NY Times categorically slander as ""unproven""). But sadly, this mode of reasoning is FAR too commonsense, FAR too empowering and FAR too practical to ever show up in news outlets such as this one where the only images ever to be found, without exception, constellate around sealing ourselves up in plastic hazmat suits (which outgas toxic volatile compounds) and breathing thru ineffective face masks whose apertures are thousands of times larger than viruses."
2020-02-26 14:24,"The world economy has taken a one, two punch.Trump has slapped trade sanctions on countries in retaliation for not giving US goods the preference he wants-he has also strangled economies like that of Iran because he wants to change their behavior.Now the Coronavirus has spread and interrupted manufacturing and sales.The economies were under strain because of tariff wars- now they are at the breaking point because of a dangerous disease which needs to be contained.No one should be surprised if this triggers a recession-Trump”s “happy talk” about the great economy is hollow and another big lie."
2020-02-26 15:38,Our very stable genius is likely already plotting the cancelation of our November elections for our own well being.  We have so much to be grateful for!
2020-02-26 15:48,"The stock market will not be our biggest problem if/when the corona virus comes here, which the CDC says it will. We could potentially see widespread panic, overrun medical facilities, disruptions in food supplies and pharmaceuticals, closed businesses, and being at the mercy of an incompetent government headed by a man who cannot be trusted and who dismantled Obama's entire epidemic response structure. The GOP had a chance to get rid of this nightmare president and the did not so they own everything that is happening. It could get really bad before the election but the long term answer is simple-vote Democratic at all levels."

2020-02-26 15:25,"It seems that Italy screened 3,000 people while France had done only 300.  This might have something to do with the number of found cases. However, it seems that while Italy blocked all flights from China, it did not control the people who came to Italy through a third airport, Frankfort, Amsterdam or London, for example.  In any event, the situation is what it is.
It is good to keep in mind that more than 600,000 people die of 
seasonal influenza each year world-wide.

if I  am quarantined over there, I prefer that to the US with Donald Duck running things. 
If I die, well , then it was my time.
Panic is not going to save us and neither is the current corrupt and utterly useless govt.  This is the new world folks, deny it as much as you like.  With the glaciers melting, and habitats destroyed, there will be much more diseases for which we have no immunity.  The Australian fires said it all:  the apocalypse is here."
2020-02-26 17:24,"He might think the Italian government is over-reacting but they aren't. The city of Wuhan where the epidemic started is a ""provincial"" city only in China. It's larger than every city in the US and they completely shut it down along with a bunch of other larger cities and they might have stopped the pandemic in China.

Italy cannot lock down cities the way the Chinese Communists can. The factory owner will eat his words in three weeks (if he is still alive then)."
2020-02-26 18:42,"There is so much more to this than the NYSE and fluctuations in the Euro.

It’s too easy to make corporate economics the focus of this, and so much other coverage. What of the human cost? How are workers being supported in the furlough, in Italy and also in China? For example, is China prying loose any of the grotesque profits they make on their compulsory labor force to give them the equivalent of unemployment benefits? Since they are state capitalism and not communism, I doubt it. 

I would very much like to see coverage of the human experience through the Wuhan lockdowns. Surely you can muster a stringer there, even after the severe shrinkage of foreign desks.

I object, as well, to the politicization of the quarantines. This has nothing to do with ‘testing’ the EU’s open borders in the Schengen area. What is needed is checks and bottlenecks at the edge of towns or regions with outbreak clusters, versus copping some kind of weird Brexit-esque schadenfreude at the supposed implications this has for frictionless international travel on a continent that has had few borders for most of humanity’s 40,000 years thereon.

Where governing (versus politics) is concerned. several commenters have raised the razing cuts to the CDC’s and Homeland Security’s pandemic teams. I wish we had some rogue sources there, tweeting or leaking out the reality behind the scenes. Americans need to know what’s happening as Trump hollows out government.

C’mon, New York Times, to the Batmobile!"
2020-02-26 20:06,"This virus kills at a rate of around 2 to 2.5%, which is 20 times more lethal than the flu, which kills at a rate of 0.1%

I wish the Chinese would ban trafficking of wildlife, it would go a long way toward preventing the spread of these coronaviruses."
2020-02-26 12:25,"Yes, Europeans have an open border policy, not only because EU treaties stipulate it (amongst its member states) but more importantly because of the principles that command our way of living, as societies. Unfortunately the same can’t be said for other countries and their governments."
2020-02-26 12:53,"I have just heard on French public radio that a man passed away in a Parisian hospital after failing to be diagnosed in a previous hospital, from which he had been transported by helicopter. No testing had been done in the first hospital because the man had not been to China or Italy."
2020-02-26 13:01,"In Europe our borders are just as open as the borders between individual states in the USA. But it isn't only open borders, but a single market and one big economy where (international) shipping sends truckers to several facilities each and every week. They often have a varied schedule, and as they visit many facilities they can bacome superspreaders. It is one of the bigger risk.

Hungarian media reported about a Hungarian trucker who was in Lombardy, fallen ill later and might be infected. If he is infected, we don't know how many other facilities have he visited for loading and unloading. Gas stations truck stops, ferries used by truckers, etc. can help the disease spread between truckers.

It would make sense to protect most truckers with mask, but sadly most companies won't provide them and in some areas they are hard to get."
2020-02-26 12:47,"It will be interesting to watch the WH leadership spin this. Trump’s ace in the hole for re-election has always been the stock market and the market will no doubt suffer more losses and years of gains  will vanish and retirement portfolios will noticeably shrink. The Coronavirus is certainly not his fault but the denials  of it’s threat to both citizens and the economy have been grossly understated and the poor leadership and zero compassion this administration demonstrates will be their undoing. Will the people who planned to vote for Trump simply based on their stock portfolios stand shoulder to shoulder in support of this administration while it fumbles around with denials and poor decisions remains to be seen, but I predict health care for all will be catching a huge wave of support as the virus slowly enters US soil and the elections near. Poor decisions do have serious consequences and Trump’s disdain for the average citizen and basic rights to affordable health care is going to pull the rug from underneath him in a slow and humiliating way."

5) What is fatality rate? Is the rate possibly overstated due to  people who recover from the virus but never get their case confirmed as they thought it was regular flu?

7) How does the fatality rate compare to seasonal flu?

2020-02-26 13:19,Since trump has decimated the bureaucracy necessary to coordinate efforts to forestall a pandemic in this country; how are we bracing for the expected outbreak of the corona virus here? They only thing we hear from trump and his minions is bombast and denial that there is a threat. The most likely response from trump will be aggressive measures to silence those trying to keep the public informed.
2020-02-26 12:43,Why focus on open border policies? The virus is spreading regardless of how easily or difficult a border crossing is for people. If its not a tourist carrier its an airline pilot at a hotel or sturdiest.
2020-02-26 13:02,"We returned from the Dominican Republic yesterday to the Charlotte, NC, airport. No thermal scans in customs. The only thing customs and immigration asked was whether we had been to China recently.

President Trump is poorly educated; he only believes what he can see. He will build a wall to stop people from crossing the southern border, but he can't understand how to stop a virus.

Trump has eviscerated many government agencies to cut expenses but also to get rid of ""disloyal"" civil servants. Now that we need experts, they will not be there.

To the Americans who voted for Trump or didn't take the time to vote - elections have consequences."
2020-02-26 13:03,"I’m appalled by our President’s complete lack of leadership on this issue. I thought he did a good job when the virus first broke out in China but now he is blatantly ignoring the problem and pretending it will all go away. 

He can manipulate the truth and lie about many things but it seems to me (at least for now....) that he get away with lying about two things: the spread of this virus and the tanking of the stock market. This will be the ultimate test to see how far he can take his lies and how far his followers are willing to go to follow and protect him."
2020-02-26 12:27,"According to trump's chief economic advisor, the corona virus is equivalent to the common cold. From this we can all rest assured in the knowledge that Trump is fighting the corona virus with the only tool he knows how to use: Lies."
2020-02-26 13:11,"Spreading from Italy? NYT journalists please stop this. A Chinese man died weeks ago in Bordeaux France: who knows how many people he had already infected. Second: a man died in a Paris hospital yesterday. He was diagnosed with corona virus just before he passed. It means he had it for who knows how long and potentially he spread it? Italy tests for the virus the population at large scale level, not the same for most EU countries. That is one reason for those numbers? We all have it, and maybe it is just another flue strain. Go panic!"
2020-02-26 14:03,"Much is made of China's earlier refusal of a CDC team and the current plea from Wuhan's nurses. I think we are talking about different things, perhaps best understood as the difference between wanting generals and needing soldiers. It is not my understanding that the CDC ever offered, or could offer, 100s of medical workers along with the necessary supplies/equipment for them to function. They were going to send a small team to observe and ""advise"". This is what China refused and probably didn't need (this is an agency that yesterday pronounced that it ""could be bad""). What China does need are soldiers(medical) and equipment on the front lines. Unfortunately, as things are looking, Covid-19 will be coming in force and we will have neither soldiers or generals to spare. 

Though perhaps we could offer one very stable genius...."
2020-02-26 14:15,"If we would just accept the fact that this is going to hit everywhere and be no deadlier than the common flu, then we could all get back to our lives.  I don't remember being locked in my house when 1.4 billion people got swine flu in 2009 (my husband and I both got it, he got deathly ill, and I had a mild cold-like illness).  There have been 80,000 cases of Covid-19.  Get real.  It's just a flu.  We'd be better off doing nothing than buying into all of this panic."

May I suggest you open a geography book or try to remember those war movies you have inevitably seen? Even with closed borders, even during wars, European borders are porous. Switzerland does have closed borders but a lot of more isolated roads are unmanned - in a very Swiss way, you are supposed to fill in a paper stating what you imported. I don't remember a question about viruses."
2020-02-26 14:18,"Donald Trump has spent the last years disparaging science generally, foreign alliances, governmental expertise, and global efforts, and touted the ""market"" as our economy.  How will those attitudes and actions serve us now with the coronavirus pandemic?  He has underfunded and gutted expertise from many of the departments that could serve us well.  His administration is heaviest with cronies, toadies, and sycophants leading them.  It appears that he has finally awoken to the threat, and may try to form a policy of some sort.  Let's hope it is not another wall."
2020-02-26 14:18,"Coronavirus is so beyond trump's interest level that I expect him to label it a hoax. He has spent his first term eliminating important CDC programs and attempting repeatedly to reduce federal health agencies' budgets.

Now, the best trump has in his bag of tricks is sending out a pathetic HHS Secretary to minimize the potential threat, while trump himself seems to prefer getting his updates from Rush Limbaugh, who likens the situation to a common cold. The only upside to this debacle is that, If the virus does make it way into the US population, it hopefully will be trump's armageddon."

Millions of Americans go without medical care today. At least 40,000 die every year because of it. They're not going to seek a diagnosis they can't afford to do anything about. Many of these people would die when an ICU bed would've saved them. Meanwhile, they would be out infecting others through no fault of their own.

Coverage is mindless and profit-based.  Many readers are terrified.  Yet from what I read in medical journals, widely available to non-physicians too, is about how preparation, being pro-active, is the difference between countries with high incidence and deaths and those with much lower effects.  The virus is the same in all countries.  The response and outcome is very different in various countries. 
Journalists must tell us more than to wash our hands.  What preparations are being made in communities? Communities most advanced in planning need to be highlighted in the daily press to serve as models and stimuli.  Citizens need information about the most responsible web sites available to them to learn, rather than be frightened.  Medical groups around the country need to be surveyed by journalists.  What are they doing to educate their patients and what preparations are they making?  What advice, from reputable sources, for people who worry that they may be infected?  What interventions are working, so far?  Is your doctor up to date?  Is your community offering resources already to help your questions?  There's a lot journalists could do besides publish daily figures that do little more than create anxiety and panic."

There have historically been outbreaks on cruise ships and countless epidemics as well as many pandemics in previous years. Imagine creating mass hysteria and imposing draconian measures every time a patient tests positive for influenza. Rather, healthcare experts have agreed that over testing for influenza causes harm and that there are more obvious ways to recognize morbidity from respiratory viruses (the old, the young, the immunosuppressed). Understand the difference between case fatality rate and true mortality rate. Covid only appears more deadly due to its poorly documented incidence and media frenzy. The only place where such measures are truly warranted is in china - a place with poor hygiene, subpar medical training and the epicenter of the outbreak.

1. Financial - have enough reserve money as many business will not be functioning - daily wages may be curtailed. Save money.
2. Transportation - have a reliable transportation plan that can get you to an urgi-clinic or a hospital if needed. EMS services could be overwhelmed. Don't just rush to the nearest emergency room, it may be crowded. 
3. Medical - if you develop symptoms, self quarantine and call for help - do not rush to emergency rooms and do not visit crowded places. Keep yourself hydrated, if you get really sick - call for help - what is really sick means - with this virus difficulty in breathing would be considered serious
4. Travel - avoid all unnecessary travel including attending large gatherings - cancel birthday celebrations etc
5. Citizenry - Self quarantine, keep an eye on the elderly around you - they may be the most vulnerable and Don't hoard stuff.

If you don’t have it, wash your hands, go to work and ignore the unjustified panic."
2020-02-26 15:04,"I live in Lombardia, Italy and I am fine. It hurts me reading twice in the article that ""Italy is struggling to contain the virus"" as if it was the source of coronavirus spreading in EU. Serious analysis should take into consideration the number of cases tested positive against the number of tests carried out. You should ask data about how many ppl have been tested elsewhere. The problem is the lack of a homogenous approach to screening. For what I know the virus could already be everywhere, so far the Italy-patient-zero has not been found, and probably it wouldn't make any difference now. Italy has decided to be transparent and pro-active, testing ppl close to first patients and finding a lot of infections paying socio-economic consequences, while in other countries ppl are tested only when they show symptoms (the virus can be transmitted way before). Moreover, mortality so far is high only among elderly infected but presenting chronic respiratory diseases or other serious health issues, like flu. If a hospital is not prepared to test for coronavirus the death could be attributed to the secondary disease (or flu) resulting in a lower number of casualties related to the virus, at least until last week. I've travelled in other countries on the 11th and 12th of Feb and guess which was the only airport where I've been tested for temperature? Milan."

He will say that his people are doing a great job of containing any spread to the U.S. He will excoriate the press for reporting on the situation abroad, given that in Trump world, ignorance is, not only bliss, it is the basis of his presidency.

Also the “fact checking” today of the political candidates bobbing and weaving for the nomination is imho as good as daily journalism gets, which is about the candidates’ confusing issues with multi nuances, but still ain’t bad, imho as an elderly exasperated political junkie.

Why?

A few weeks ago, Trump's proposed FY-2021 budget (which begins October 2020) cut the CDC's discretionary budget authority by $1.3 billion compared with fiscal 2020 -- a 19% cut -- including $25 million from public health preparedness and response outlays.

Chip Kahn, president and CEO of the Federation of American Hospitals, particularly decried the proposed cuts to public health agencies, noting that ""The spread of the coronavirus is evidence that we need a strong permanent defense system to stop threats before they start and contain them when they do.""

Bottom line - can't let funding to help address our nation's preparedness and responsiveness for a pesky virus that is ramping up to become a global pandemic to get in the way of building an ineffective wall along our Mexican border....."

One way to blunt the severity of the spread is for people in all economic brackets — including the homeless and undocumented —  to feel able to get medical assessments and treatment without regard to direct cost or, in the case of some immigrants, legal ramifications.  However fragmented as a society Americans may feel right now, we live together and are physically linked.  Those who have “better” private insurance will benefit little if their communities are shut down because they’re infection hot zones.  This is not the first pandemic we will experience, or the worst.  I frankly had questions about financing universal healthcare.  But most other advanced nations have figured it out, and so can we.  We’re in this together."

Unfortunately, I think we are seeing signs of things starting to get out of control with the corona outbreak in Japan. According to local media reports:

The number of infection is steadily increasing despite the fact that the Japanese government policy does not allow people to get PCR tested at hospitals to see if they are infected from the coronavirus. The tests are not covered by any insurance, and you have to go to the public health centers run by local governments to get tested. And even if you go to these centers, they won’t test you unless you have cold/flu like symptoms with 4+ days of 37.5 c fever or pneumonia AND with possible links to China or Corona infected patients. If you don’t fit this prerequisite, you get rejected and sent home without knowing whether you or your loved ones are infected or not. There are many stories of parents taking their kids with flu and pneumonia like symptoms to these centers, but still they did not test them because of no known links to China or Corona infected patients. So many families are stuck with sick kids and family members, and other family members are voluntarily staying at home so not to risk transmitting the virus to others."

What are the authorities doing here in NY to avoid any spread? I'll be traveling soon, but now I wonder if maybe I should just drive instead of flying. God help us all and God help all those medical staff putting their lives at risk saving others."
2020-02-26 16:23,"The parenthesis on European “open borders” is highly problematic for a couple of reasons.  First, people in the US forget how geographical space is quite different in Europe. In Europe, a 1.5 hour flight crosses 3-4 countries. In California, this 1.5 hour flight gets you from San Diego to San Francisco. Second, seamless movement between European countries existed before the creation of the European Union. While some countries instated the need for a visa for entry and others didn’t, travel between specific countries was not complicated before 1992. Lastly, people travel and migrate regardless of borders politics. In describing efforts to control the spread of COVID-19, the focus should be more about public health interventions and less about politics."
2020-02-26 16:29,"The open borders between European countries are analogous to the open borders between states in the US. The EU is analogous to our federal government.

I might not have the ideal solution, but I would advise reducing the stress on the Wuhan nurses by instituting a hierarchy command structure in which military volunteers take commands from nurses reduced to shorter shifts to reduce their stress as they direct groups of military volunteers to perform most tasks of caring for the patients. Do not ignore their plea. Some foreign care workers might rotate in then out to help, having gained valuable knowledge of the lessons learned by the Wuhan nurses to teach the rest of the world for the future. I might add, the Chinese have done a remarkable job of keeping pace with the disease, from leaders and caregivers to patients. Terrific job by all. Out of chaos always comes order."

A couple of articles also have commented on the fact that the death rate for men in China where the smoking rate for men is very high compared to that for women is much for men that women. In addition to getting my annual flu shot (which obviously won’t help with this virus) I did something way back in 1965 that will enhance my chances of surviving should I contract this or any other virus. After nearly five years of smoking I simply quit. I used to puff away on one to two packs a day until that morning when I decided that it was a dumb and stupid habit with absolutely no positive advantages. I didn’t light up that first smoke of the day and never looked back.

canned foods, peanut butter and jelly, orange, apples, all kinds of nuts, chocolate(yum) all have a long shelf life. Toilet paper also seems to be a thing that goes fast when people panic and begin to hoard.

shop at later hours when stores are less crowded

use stores with self checkout options

do your best to avoid touching doorknobs in high traffic areas.

on the street give the people their own personal space

don't spit on the sidewalk

remove your shoes upon entering your home

use plenty of lysol , spray your shoes after you take them off.

avoid places where lots of people congregate

just act like somebody who has not taken a flu shot

be cautious and be prepared, ignorance may be bliss but its dangerous also.

You may see some strange things till this thing blows over, like the NCAA tournament played in empty gyms, the same for MLB baseball games.

My mother found him leaning against a lamp post Friday night two weeks before Christmas, unable to walk home in the snow from the bus stop after work. He died at home that Sunday night and buried Wednesday, leaving a mother and five children. The flu pandemic then was a multi-year event, as this one might be. She said it came in waves over 2-3 years. My mother recalled quarantine window stickers on homes in Detroit. 

Recalling a fascinating  book from 25 years ago, ""The Coming Plague"", where bacterial infections can be far more lethal, quarantines are more effective, because of the shorter incubation period. Contrary to that, viruses, the author explained, though maybe not as deadly, are more insidious because of their habit of not emerging in an infected patient before it has a chance to spread to others.

I may stand corrected (please do), but I recall the author explaining that viruses become less deadly over time (1-2 years) because the germ has less interest in killing its host, and eventually recreates itself as more innocuous. Still, a 2-3 percent fatality rate, what we're seeing today, seems extremely high.

Though it is not fair to say Chinese government should be hold fully accountable for the outbreak, but its clamp on press and speech freedom did play a key part in setting off a global health crisis that originated from a dozen of infections in Wuhan.
On the flip side, it is the tight grip on the society down to communities that has given it unparallel resources, mobilizations and communicating information in response to an outbreak of such a scale."
2020-02-26 11:57,"From Feb 12 to Feb 21st I traveled from USA to Singapore and Malaysia, back to Singapore and returned to the USA entering customs and immigration through San Francisco, CA.  
In Asia, I, and everyone entering Changi and Langkawi airports were heat/temperature body scanned before approaching the customs counters.  I was asked about travel to China, I was asked if I felt physically well. There are copious signs in Singapore reminding people to wash hands, immediately seek medical care if feeling any respiratory illness, where to go, numbers to call, etc.
In contrast, returning to the USA on Feb. 21, I was greeted at a chaotic customs area, stained and dirty carpets, confused lines, no questions from officials about my health or if I visited high risk areas at all.  No body heat scans - the contrast was striking and troubling.  
Since I’ve been back in my own country, I read about the virus spreading worldwide. I’m concerned about the clear lack of infrastructure here in the USA to protect our citizens and visitors from this massive and global health threat.
The irony that our administration is building a physical wall on our Southern border with Mexico but meanwhile lacks simple posters reminding all people to wash hands and monitor our respiratory health is terribly troubling."

It seems that lots of these one-off cases, whether in Brazil, Switzerland or Innsbruck originating from people who travelled to Italy would indicate that there may be a much higher infection rate in Lombardy than is currently showing up. After all, if only 325 people have the virus there, what are the odds of having so many new cases globally deriving from Italian visits?"

The time frame between the first infection and this early global spread is significant. Remember there must be many, many people with the virus who have been traveling around the world all this time. The disease mimics the flu, and no one will test for this virus unless they have either been to China (or one of the new outbreak countries coming online), or been in contact with someone who has. 

Common sense dictates we should plan seriously for this. This has the potential to be a new experience for everyone on the planet, and this is still just the beginning.

2020-02-26 16:52,"Now is the time for the Dems to be pro-active in its approach to the coronavirus.  While Trump is in India getting roasted by Modi and looking foolish with his comments downplaying the threat, we can prepare the American people and show leadership where its lacking.  We have safety videos on aircraft promoting safety before takeoff, we can surely do national public service announcements during primetime showing Americans how to wash their hands, avoid public contact in high risk areas, and how to cough properly.   C'mon Dems, take charge of the situation."
2020-02-26 16:58,"Trump may be a germaphobe and believe his henchmen when they say that the US is sealed airtight, all to artificially inflate the financial markets.  But the wall they are building on the southern border will not keep this virus out.  Coronaviruses are agnostic and don’t  really care whether they infect Republicans or democrats, liberals or conservatives, fox or cnn; it doesn’t require that those people listen to one another. They just have to breathe the same air. Mr Trump, despite his inflated sense of self, breathes that air too, and by denying the problem exists, he exponentially increases risk of his own exposure. He will soon find that his Make America Great Again rallies will morph into Make America Sick (Again) and infect people in (coughing) droves. What happens when he tweets to 20M people in respiratory failure that their inability to breathe is fake news and that Obamacare should be rescinded? Tragically, they might not be able to hear him."
2020-02-26 16:58,"Enough with the sensational headlines, how about talking about the disease itself and the thousands that have already recovered? Just how bad is it? Is it much worse than a cold or the flu? Do most get over it with the same care they practice for those diseases? How long are they typically ill? What are the stages of the disease? Surely all these answers are known and all would help folks put the sensational headlines into perspective."

The possibility that this coronavirus shuts down our economy for an extended period is real, and could lead to periods of unemployment and hardship.

If 1/3 of the world's population ultimately become infected as in the influenza pandemic of 1918-1919, upwards of 65 million people could die.

2020-02-26 17:27,"Sorry, but I have to roll my eyes when I hear about the spread of coronavirus and how many people could get sick and die.  I wish journalists and readers had a better sense of epidemiology and case identification.  Testing positive for COVID-19 does not mean the person is sick or symptomatic or even capable of spreading the virus.  Many people, except if they are older and/or have diabetes, have relatively mild symptoms.  The progression of the virus in populations is rapid when there are large numbers of people in close proximity, as is the case in Chinese cities, large cruise vessels, and Korean religious cults.  I wish we could all get a grip on our emotions and fears, but I admit that the media is not helping in this regard, especially when it can get more attention by hyping the epidemic.  That is not to say that quarantine is not necessary, or that fairly draconian measures must not be taken to prevent the spread of the disease, especially in the hot spots.  But panic is not the proper response."
2020-02-26 17:30,"During concern about the H5N1 virus about 15 years ago, I worked for USDA.  Every Agency, down to the lowest office had to have a pandemic plan.  I know because I was in charge of this for our Agency in my state.  We had to submit plans, we had conference calls, there was constant contact and planning.  Luckily we never had to implement any of our plans.   Unlike the current Administration, they have no plan and even fired the pandemic coordinator.   Anyone who thinks the current Administration is prepared for this is fooling themselves.   The test kits being used in China reportedly are very unreliable.  It's going to spread and nothing is going to stop it - we live a world that is mobile and globally connected.  People have been traveling around that did not know they were infected - until there is a vaccine we are going to have to cope with this.  Of course the Trump Administration's current budget drastically reduces the budgets of the CDC an NIH -smart move."

2020-02-26 16:20,"GENEVA (AFP) - More new cases of the coronavirus have been reported outside China than inside the hardest-hit country for the first time, the World Health Organisation said on Wednesday (Feb 26).

""Yesterday, the number of new cases reported outside China exceeded the number of new cases in China for the first time,"" WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told diplomats in Geneva, according to a written version of his speech.

The UN health agency put the number of new cases in China at 411 on Tuesday and those registered outside the country stood at 427.

Governments worldwide are scrambling to prevent the spread of the new coronavirus after a surge of infections in Italy, Iran and South Korea.

Dr Tedros said the ""sudden increase of cases"" in those countries was ""deeply concerning"", adding that a WHO team would travel to Iran this weekend to evaluate the situation."

We've literally brought in more infected people on purpose, for care, than the number of infected people just arriving into our communities.

Death rates are about 3.5% mainly old and those who have prior conditions.
By July we should see the recovered come back to work and whatever parts of the economy which are not broken, slowly start recovery as well.
Here is the thing, assuming no vaccine is found in time, the best strategy is to get the infection EARLY, while the medical system is still operational, which it might not be at the top of the contagion, this looks like an exponential up and exponential down profile.
At the moment doubling time is 3-4 days so all 7 billions world inhabitants will be infected inside 75 days.

Ditto the WHO and UN. But he wasn't content with simply dismantling the firewall between us and pandemic. Nope. He had to go one better and work to ensure that we still have no universal healthcare and work to create a reality where low wage workers are so poor that staying home if sick, the only way to prevent the spread, is a luxury too many Americans cannot access. 

To exacerbate things further, because he ascribes to magical thinking and decrees that ""April"" will ""vanquish"" this ""bug,"" we have also failed to do any of the commonsense planning other nations put in place months ago. We're still letting sick patients fly. Still no mandated temperatures at airports. Still no attempt to actually assess the health of those being let in. And little effort to keep us informed about exact symptoms and how to know when to go to the hospital, for those lucky enough to be able to afford healthcare.

I would recommend an immediate public service campaign--posters everywhere instructing and reminding people. It's basic, and it might help contain the spread, but most people are absolutely unaware of the amount they touch their face unnecessarily, or that they cough or sneeze into their hands. It's as if at some level they are thinking, ""I don't have any germs--no worries--other people have germs."" People don't seem to understand that in order to contain the spread, they have to stay healthy by not spreading the virus or receiving the virus from others. They have to become aware.

There is a patient in France and another one in Germany which have no connection to any previously known clusters. That could indicate that there are several more undiscovered clusters of infection within Europe.  The State Department should issue a travel warning for countries bordering Italy including France, Switzerland, Austria, Slovenia and Croatia.

The was also a report from Japan that a man was infected while visiting Bali, Indonesia. The Indonesians aren't admitting to any infections but it seems unlikely that they don't have any. Inbound travelers from Indonesia should be checked for fever. Travel from Indonesia should be shut down if further infections are detected. 

Fever screening of all inbound international passengers from Europe, Africa and Asia would help to alert us if a country starts exporting cases in our direction.

You are missing an important part of this story: there is not sufficient testing of patients in the US.

Send any sick staffer with a cold to the doctor and see if they bother to test that person. I can tell you that here in NJ, we have not heard of anyone being tested. Perhaps that is the protocol but I would like an apples to apples comparison on how these countries are identifying who is sick and how that process would fare in the US.

I would also like to understand how sick the patients outside China are....How far into their disease are most patients? What are the outcomes thus far?

I ask because a Chinese friend showed me a hospital with dead bodies in the halls--a photo he got from a relative. While I don't know the origins of the photo, there is a disconnect from that photo to the American response. So either outcomes are better in Western countries, or perhaps outcomes are better if people are treated early in the disease....but if the tis the case, hear in the US, we are sitting targets. Especially in and around NYC.

We need more details."

2020-02-26 19:54,"The time of reckoning is coming for the United States and our broken health care system. It’s a minor miracle that we haven’t seen COVID-19 rip through American cities and towns. With tens of millions of Americans without healthcare insurance, we’re completely ill equipped to handle the virus. Faced with financial ruin, Americans who might have good reason to feel they’ve contracted the virus will attempt to self-treat and self-quarantine. This goes for Americans who face huge out-of-pocket co-payments if they access the care. 

One thing that the U.S. federal government can do right now is to set aside funding so that the cost of test and treatment for COVID-19 and similar illnesses (flu and pneumonia) is completely paid by the government. This is one affirmative step that the government can take that will obviate the most vexing problem in an epidemic — people avoiding testing and treatment and becoming super-spreaders."

So in a way it is not new. Been there done that. Use the full force of the power of collective scientific knowledge to repeat the feat of eradicating viruses like smallpox and rinderpest. 

Glad to notice that we as a nation is shifting from a panic mode to a preparedness mode while recognizing that TRAVEL to and from continents by infected persons could spread COVID-19 and restriction of travel from and to places where there are infected persons could stem the spread. Right now all continents on our planet except Africa and Antaractica are free of the virus but that could change.

Always thought the stock market will start creeping back again. Those who sold at a loss are at a loss.  Never thought that trade war will be credited with preparing US for the war against CorV. Govts across the world have been awakened. Not sure whether it is because 3,000+ people will have died or because a dark cloud of global panic has set in due to ignorance or because inhabitants of the world are holding the feet of govts to fire. I read that President DJT is trying to appoint a CorV Czar. I hope it is some independent and not a donor or buddy of the admin. but someone who has a proper understanding of viruses foremost and will carry a blue print for a multi-pronged approach to the eradication of CorV before the end of June."

2020-02-26 21:40,"I have been observing the availability and prices of face masks for about a month and a half now and I have a few remarks. Perhaps most importance was the really thoughtless invention decades back called ""on time production"" that was designed to reduce costs associated with manufacturing inventory of both raw materials and finished products. I believe it originated in Detroit, and consider how that methodology worked out. So supplies of masks are hampered by a lack of inventory and as is the reality of many in business from face masks to oil,  the prices have gone through the roof. Retailers would say it is due to ""Supply and Demand"" but my view is their price gouging is more along the line of ""We have the supply, so we demand what we want"". I'm an old guy who like all others know one thing about all of our people; that if there is someone to rob, there will be robbers. 

But past the griping, the government has correctly diverted production to supplying health care centers and offices where the sick will be concentrated. I agree with that entirely, but why wasn't there adequate inventory in commercial businesses aside from the government emergency supplies likely only stocked for medical disciplines? Perhaps now, policy makers and business leaders will address shortages with 24/7 expanded production of traditional products and other needed products. Like the old Boy Scout Motto says; ""Be Prepared"". And Boy Scouts don't panic, we lead. Thanks."

I find this phrase out of context. Having open borders in Europe means no ID checks or visa requirements for traveling within the Schengen Area. Keeping the virus from spreading is not about border controls but about keeping it contained in the cities and areas it has already affected. How would a passport check at the border contain the spread of the disease? This sort of comment unnecessarily fuels far-right recriminations about closed borders."

Airliners are pressurized in flight at higher altitudes. I have to assume that pressurization entails an amount of metered cabin air exchange to assure fresh air for the passengers and crew. That means that as fresh air is drawn in, some cabin air is exhausted, thus spewing out disease as it flies between cities. I thought of this after reading about the alarming rate at which the disease is spreading. It must be entrained in cabin air and the cabin air must be being exhausted to atmosphere as fresh air is directed inwards.

It is imperative that a fast moving F.A.A. guided Government directed program commence to engineer and install cabin exhaust air filtration equipment. This is not rocket science. Utilizing off the shelf filtration media incorporated in quickly designed and built enclosures attached to airliners exhaust ports could happen quickly and very effectively slowing down atmospheric contamination by disease that could be carried by rain into land.

The economic dislocation will be serious, because every good and service relies on a location that could be under lockdown.  The longer a supply chain, the greater the odds a lockdown will affect it. I imagine that just as the Apple factories in China reopen, the port of Los Angeles will close, as an example. And as soon as the Port reopens, UPS will close.

Sorry, Mr. Vice President, prayer is not the solution."

The facepalm moments continue to pile up with this Presidency.  I am hoping we get out of this on sheer luck (i.e. CDC officials are really running the show) because it won't be on the prowess of the Trump-Pence brain trust."
2020-02-27 0:17,"So Trump has appointed Mike Pence as point person.  As I predicted earlier today (Wed 2/26) Trump would pick a yes man and a sycophant who is utterly void of any expertise at all in epidemics, virology, disaster relief, or passing laws.

Whatever happens Pence has proven that he will praise Trump's expert handling.

""We're very, very ready for  this ...""  Oh come on, no we aren't, we don't even have the widespread testing capability to tell whether we have an epidemic here or not.  If we were planning a road trip all the tires would be flat, the battery dead and no gas in the tank.

An emergency funding request has been sent to Congress, so we'll start hiring people to enable spending in a month or two.  Good work Donald.  Great strong leader when vacuous lies are in order.  But not so much if there is a serious problem."

2020-02-27 0:19,I ll be  more reassured when the administration puts forward a scientific and researched method to handle this problem. And hopefully; they will re instate the pandemic- crisis team. This is not a problem that Pence can” pray away”.

12.5 Million he gives back on Dec. 20, 2019 -- for gun research only -- other research halted due to a lack of funding."
2020-02-27 0:21,It’s a shame how Trump put Pence to oversee this large issue when he could direct people who specialize in the fields required to make sure we protect our citizens from the virus and protect those who do get sick with it and help them with the bills that can come about this. Our healthcare system is strained and the people who do contract it might not want to or be able to get help from hospitals because of the cost that comes with it. I just hope we can work to help fight against this virus and take all precautionary steps to fight this virus without being racist or prejudice to those who have contracted it and need help.
2020-02-27 0:03,"Well, since he does not believe in evolution a vaccine may not be necessary. We can just pray it away."
2020-02-27 0:03,"Ah yes, Mr. Pence, with the extensive medical/scientific background.

Perhaps he will deal with the possible catastrophe by praying for it not to affect the United States?"
2020-02-27 0:13,"Just what we need- Trump is appointing a know nothing politician to try to save us from the coronavirus. This will not end well for our families, communities, and economies. Expect more collapse of global economy, more pandemic, more deaths, all while Trump keeps telling us that everything is perfect. Look no further than Trump’s example of dealing with global heating. He solved it by saying that it doesn’t exist and that all the expert scientists are wrong- all while people are losing their homes and communities to global heating. Trump even wants America to burn even more coal and oil! To think that our families’ lives are in the hands of Trump presidency is beyond bizarre!"
2020-02-26 23:45,Trump is comparing flu deaths to this virus. The flu has had plenty of time to become an effective predator. If we become laxed corona may equal the flu in 12 months.
2020-02-27 0:05,"By naming Pence to head the Coronavirus response, Trump now has someone to blame when it goes sideways."
2020-02-27 0:09,"I feel so much more assured now that VP. Pence is involved. Maybe he can appoint a few experts to his team, you know, like the entire crew of Doctors that were fired in 2018."
2020-02-27 0:12,"Listening to President Trump is horrifying.  He keeps referring to “the problem.”  I don’t think he actually understands what is going on.  He can’t stop himself from pivoting to the economy and industries who are going to suffer losses and attacking his perceived enemies.

Investors are more concerned about dying a preventable death under the watch of this administration than the fluctuations in the stock market."
2020-02-26 23:46,"When it comes to Trump...no confidence, no trust, no credibility."
2020-02-27 0:01,"During the press conference, Trump looks like he's about to fall asleep. Oh, I forget, he is asleep---at the wheel, that is, except where it concerns him.  That he states that ""We're very very ready for this,"" makes me think otherwise.  Never trust a pathological liar because they are usually wrong."

2020-02-27 0:17,"This guy blames the drop in the stock market on a Democratic debate, backtracks on needing someone leading our pandemic efforts but says he isn’t, reverses his claim that it’ll all by over by April, uses this press conference to praise himself for everything, doesn’t own his cuts to CDC or failure to insist on US experts being in China to assist and coordinate, and on and on and on. Didn’t know how many people die from the flu.

Republicans, won’t it be fun if a literal virus from a dictatorial country takes down this reprehensible leader, instead of digital mayhem getting him re-elected?"
2020-02-27 0:21,Mike Pence?  This is supposed to make me feel confident that our government is combating the virus effectively?  Really?
2020-02-27 0:21,"Thoughts and prayers, especially prayers.  And if things get bad, it's somebody else's fault."

2020-02-27 0:00,Great! Now I feel safe.
2020-02-27 0:15,Listening to him speaking at his press conference is like listening to a grade school child. He just keeps repeating himself over and over again. He provided information in the first minute after that its been repetitive dribble. Now he’s blaming the drop in the stock market to the democratic debate. I can listen to no more!
2020-02-26 23:45,Hopefully Trump will catch it. Wouldn’t that be the sweetest irony.
2020-02-27 0:19,Plausible deniability. If the Government contains the virus Trump will take full credit.The VP and senior officials will lavishly praise Trump. If a disaster occurs VP Pence wears it and Trump avoids personal responsibility. A typical Trump ploy.

2020-02-26 23:56,"Not reassuring to have a guy, Pence, who counts on God to take care of everything, in charge of dealing with a potential epidemic."
2020-02-27 0:03,"Perfect.   Few people realize that Pence is a world-famous, world-class epidemiologist and virologist.  BLOTUS assured us during the 2016 that he knows all the best people and this is further proof of this outlandish and unfounded claim.  Thank goodness BLOTUS’s gutting of the CDC and NHS will have no adverse affect on efforts to arrest and cure the Coronavirus."
2020-02-27 0:05,"Well, thank goodness Mike Pence is on the case. We can all rest well tonight!"
2020-02-27 0:09,"Great, He will be screaming, ""Lock her up."" Then of course he will pray over it an it will all be fine. A simple job really for Dr Pence. What, Me Worry!"
2020-02-27 0:18,Trump seemed uncomfortable today talking about how much money the government should spend on dealing with COVID-19. I wonder if he's worried that it could cut into the money he's trying to appropriate to build his wall.
2020-02-27 0:21,"Oh great!

A divisive, evangelical, end-of-timer will ""lead the response"" to the viral pneumonia pandemic that already threatens millions with the proverbial ""end"" of times.   What could go wrong here?  Shouldn't he be disqualified for religious reasons because in his mind this virus portends what's ""written"" in that collection of ancient fairy tales and he's more apt to welcome it rather than prepare anyone to avoid it."

Now, I starting to feel ill."
2020-02-26 23:59,"Of course this is Trump's plan. That way when it implodes he gets to blame Pence. 

And Pence -- you can't pray the virus away."

2020-02-27 0:02,They are talking from the one who knows nothing to the ones who know the most. Trump looked impatient and bored after babbling about different numbers. He looked disoriented and less articulate than usual.
2020-02-27 0:13,Wow.  Trump is virtually incoherent.  How can he be permitted to remain in office??
2020-02-27 0:27,"Listening to the conference now, and it's clear that he doesn't understand what is happening. He doesn't get the subtleties.

Pence CAUSED an HIV epidemic in his state of Indiana when he was governor when he shut down a rural testing site because it was at the Planned Parenthood. The number of cases dwarfed the number in NYC.

He prayed for days about whether to supply clean needles to his population until his Lt. Gov told him to get on it because people were dying."
2020-02-27 0:21,First question Mr. Coronavirus Czar Pence - are you going to request that full funding be restored for the CDC and all science departments related to helping to find a cure or reduce the spread of the disease?
2020-02-26 23:54,"Trump just announced Pence will be his Coronavirus czar.  It’s a total setup.  The government is clueless, in denial and will definitely mishandle this.  What better way to ensure pence has no future."
2020-02-26 23:54,I find the liberal response to the administration’s actions to address the corona virus appalling  and despicable. Their hatred for Trump knows no bounds. Real experts agree that the actions taken by the administration have been quick and effective. But the onslaught of criticism by the liberals is never ending. Amazing.
2020-02-26 23:55,"Sorry, but when a serial liar (and linguistic cripple) tells me the ""vaccine is going well"" I am not reassured, not am I reassured when a somnolent yes man who happens to be vice president is chosen to lead the government effort to protect us from the corona virus.

Per the actual report, the bad news is the following: 

'1. National health security is fundamentally weak around the world. No country is fully prepared for epidemics or pandemics, and every country has important gaps to address.'

'2. Countries are not prepared for a globally catastrophic biological event.'

So Trump says everything is ok, but the best science that he's comfortable referring to, but doubtless hasn't read, says NO COUNTRY is ready for a pandemic. Hold on to your seats. The ride could be very rough with a leader who is way out of his depth.

Trump implies that he is personally running every decision for every aspect of every crisis. This is impossible because there are too many decisions, they are too complex, he is not an expert, and he needs to hire experts and allow them to make the decisions. He is a politician to the core, but his portrayal of government operations as all top down from the president is wrong, it is dumb, and I cannot believe even his supporters believe this.  He sounds like a dictator, like Xi and Putin. They like to pretend that they run every little thing too. Not true for any huge country! Trump voters, wise up."

Even his gratuitous slaps at Pelosi, Schumer, and the Democratic presidential candidates were incorporated seamlessly in whatever he was talking about and with the same tone.

Suffice to say an administration which is fraught with lying and covering up anything they don’t like to hear is busy doing nothing else than that, at this point.

Whistling past the graveyard and telling us we'll be fine and that the threat of Covid 19 in America is ""lessening"",  doesn't cut the mustard when we have no memory of the global pandemic of Spanish Flu today.  We can only hope that the anxiety over a flu epidemic maybe arriving here in America will be as faulty as the fear of Y2K disrupting the world 20 years ago  Y2K didn't matter diddly back then despite worries that the world would change on a certain day.

And this is not like the flu, not for the 50s. 60s, 70s, 80s who may be older or have underlying conditions, who would not otherwise have died if they had not contracted this coronavirus. For these people, the death rate is not 2% but much higher. It's like herd protection of vaccination--the less infected people around you, the less chances the older people will get it.

The time to act is now or never, so the chances of Americans getting infected will remain low. All it takes is one person, one infected person without symptom to come in, silently spreading the virus and chain infection while they go about their usual business.

Why do we bother to listen to Trump? When he is not lying, he gets the facts wrong, or he exaggerates."
2020-02-27 1:28,"VP Pence has no credentials of any kind on health matters, as his record shows, with no epidemiological experience at all.  We need someone with a strong background in epidemiology, an M.D. at least, to coordinate efforts to effectively control the coronavirus.  This is not a political issue, it is a health issue that poses a very grave threat to our country.  Pence is not the person for this job."

We have not been testing anyone lately, for weeks really, in the entire US, fewer than 500 people have been tested! Every expert knows there are far more than 15 cases. And anyone walking around with it, with or without symptoms, is spreading it to many more, and so on and so on, the circle widens. And therefore, the disease is, right now, this moment, spreading about our country. It will get far far worse before it gets better. What happened in Wuhan can happen anywhere and everywhere."
2020-02-27 1:45,"Pence will be really good at praying. Of course it was a Christian church in South Korea that massively spread the virus, so it does not look like Christians are getting any special virus consideration from God.

If the virus actually has a go at us, come November people will remember how the Republicans underfunded the CDC and made their lives unpleasant — to say the least.  To say the most, some may get really, really sick and a small percentage will actually die.

Just a few days ago he was indicating warm weather would save us.  We can't possibly be ready if the people in charge are this poorly informed. And if they're spreading information that is incorrect.

We should have actual experts in charge of this.  VP Pence is a very poor substitute.  

Trump eliminated the CDC staff with the proper expertise for this sort of situation back in 2018. Apparently, noone in the Administration had foresight to understand the possibility of a situation like the present one, despite the fact that CDC staff attempted to explain the need. And despite the fact that SARS provided a clear notification.

Trump thinks it's more important to project a false image of preparation to calm the financial markets than to provide correct information that might save actual LIVES."
2020-02-27 0:58,"It appeared that, at minimum, every third statement made by anyone must include praise for Trump, who loomed large over his minions, making even this a campaign event, and giving me plenty to be sick about besides the coronavirus."

The World Health Organization, the international organization that must be worked with, if you are serious about controlling this disease, stated that 50 percent of those who used tobacco, died from smoking related illnesses. 
So, what does Pence do? He was one of 97 House Republicans who voted against the Tobacco Control Act in 2009.
He got over $100,000 from tobacco companies.
Money trumps science, which is the motto of the Trump White House.
The only thing that is for certain is that Pence will pray to Jesus for his immunity against this illness.
The rest of us can go to that hot place below."
2020-02-27 1:32,It will help reduce fear if every single article published about the virus will include the percentage of how many survive the illness. It would really help to see that 98% survival rate figure.
2020-02-27 1:58,"Nothing like putting a know nothing in charge of the biggest health challenges in recent years. So much for national security and keeping people safe. 

The real truth is that since trump came into office he has slashed the CDC budget to the point where retired officials are requesting donations. We are woefully unprepared."
2020-02-27 2:01,"To hear the President say ""We're very, very ready for this"" is not reassuring. He's probably fired anyone with any expertise in dealing with a looming crisis like this and has predictably put the matter in the hands of a political crony (in this case, the VP).  This science doubter is probably getting his information from some Twitter or Facebook account or some internet troll.  

I'm very worried."

At some point might this lead to prohibitions on, or at least warnings against, travel from the US to affected countries (not that the US won't be affected, unless of course that magical vaccine suddenly appears, along with the miraculous curative powers of springtime!)?"

2020-02-27 2:26,"on the 60th case:. the article states ""Until now, public health officials have been able to trace all of the infections in the country to a recent trip abroad or a known patient.""


What this should say is that this is the first case that was TESTED that could not be traced because until now the conditions for running the test required a priori travel or other connection!!

 Corona is out there and not sure why county /state health departments and CDC were not screening more people without a direct link earlier."

2020-02-27 2:08,Another reason for the Trump haters to find fault with President Trump.  They are never satisfied.  If he sat and did nothing they would condemn.  Now that he has set up a plan and put it into place the Trump haters are not happy.  These people are impossible.

2020-02-27 2:25,"In addition to all the lies and misleading information during his rambling press conference, Trump also tried to blame the drop in the stock market on the Democratic candidates, called Nancy Pelosi incompetent, bragged about his approval ratings, mocked Chuck Schumer and mimicked his NY accent, kept trying to minimize COVID-19 by comparing it to the flu, boasted about how frequently he washes his hands (implying that if everyone else did the same, the virus wouldn't be a problem), lied about the mortality rate and disputed the 2% figure, boasted that we should credit his Muslim travel ban for stopping the virus from spreading to the U.S., and could not give a coherent reason for appointing Mike Pence to coordinate the administration's response to this.
I'm not feeling very reassured that the trump administration is handling this all too well."
2020-02-27 2:31,"What is the percentage of people who die who have contracted coronvirus?  How does  this percentage compare with that of other   fatalities from other communicable diseases.  When I look at the numbers, it appears that only a small number of people actually get this disease.  There are over a billion people in China but only two or so thousand have died from coronovirus.  But people need things to be afraid of and newspapers need things to write about that scare people.   So let's all worry ourselves sick for th next few weeks."

We made fun of the Chinese instead of using the window of opportunity to prepare for it. We called them the ""Sick Man of Asia"", we called Xi authoritarian as if he's incompetent as Trump. The action Xi has taken and sacrifice China made history will judge. WHO officials are in awe of what China did. The democratic candidates in the debate all made fun of Xi and China, which shows their own ignorance and the sham of democracy."

They say it expensive to test every possible case, well that’s why we pay taxes.  We all deserve a chance to know if we have the Coronavirus.  They made faulty tests, not every state has a testing facility, not enough beds, not able to find masks online or local retailers, lawsuits about where to place infected individuals, not placing self-quarantine restrictions from those coming in from Northern Italy.  How can they say we are ready for this?  Someone please explain our readiness.

The crash may not happen this month, but it will come soon.
Such a crash will have major political implications.  The high Stock Market seems to be Trump’s primary indicator of economic success.
Trump is concerned that this looks bad for him.  His natural response to any crisis is to lie, cover up his own mistakes, and blame others.
In fact, after Trump cut the budget of the CDC two years ago, experts predicted that this would hurt American preparedness:

In 2018 the Trump administration and Trump himself fired all the top experts in the CDC the deal with pandemics. Why?"
2020-02-27 4:50,"It is interesting to see the first case of community transmission of the virus is from Solano County, California.... Someone should probably have qualified the statement and said person came from the Travis AFB area.  But, this would have caused panic as the county population realized one of the ""virus free"" people from China and Japan that passed through the base and their towns may have left something behind.  Of course, in an unprepared and disinterested administration, disinformation is all part of the game.  Wonder how long it twill take to make 2 or 3 million test kits?"
2020-02-27 3:54,"Mike Pence is the coronavirus Czar? Based on -- his experience in public health? His medical expertise? Or the fact that he will do and say anything Trump wants him to. 

As I recall, the one time Pence oversaw an epidemic, it was an HIV epidemic in his home state. And he disregarded the advice of public health professionals, making the problem worse."
2020-02-27 4:14,"Has anyone thought about the need for more nurses and allied health professionals during a major health crisis in the US, and how Trump's anti-immigration policies and outright hostility to people from the brown skinned regions of the world amplify that risk? For the past few decades, quite a lot of the people working in hospitals and clinics have come from Latin America, Africa, and Asia. Now, when they may be most needed, we have an administration that screens them out, kicks them out, and promotes an atmosphere that leaves non-white visitors feeling unwelcome and unsafe. In turn, that makes the United States less safe for all."
2020-02-27 4:55,"The US does not know if COVID19 is here. Only a few people are tested, because we do not have the kits available to test more. And, apparently they are expensive and not covered by insurance, even if you recently returned from China, and have symptoms. The danger is not acting fast enough, diagnosis and warning contacts. Which we currently cannot do. The tragedy would be if enough caught it and needed medical intervention which would not be available locally because of overrun demand. That is when the FEDS are supposed to supply the means to meet the demands in local hotspots."
2020-02-26 14:35,"Research has shown that treatment and prevention of coronavirus infection is likely to be successful with vitamin C, vitamin D, zinc, magnesium and selenium.  I'm taking these and I'm giving these to my family.  It's too bad the WHO isn't advertising this simple inexpensive and safe preventive intervention. While it is unlikely to be 100% effective, it is likely to be more effective than what is being done now, and it may reduce the severity of the disease when it occurs by strengthening the immune system.  Other basic immune booster dietary and herbal treatments are also likely to be helpful, if not perfect.  The media seems uninterested in these intervention thus far, although I suspect that if the pandemic worsens, in desperation people may start turning in this direction."
2020-02-27 9:47,What I really do not understand is how this world panic and massive hysteria corresponds to the real threat of the virus? It does not. The fact is that the vast majority of the cases produce mild flu-like symptoms and that this is almost no different than the regular flu. I just do not understand this panic. What am I missing??
2020-02-27 5:00,"I have a vital task for the government to take the lead on;

Airliners are pressurized in flight at higher altitudes. I have to assume that pressurization entails an amount of metered cabin air exchange to assure fresh air for the passengers and crew. That means that as fresh air is drawn in, some cabin air is exhausted, thus spewing out disease as it flies between cities. I thought of this after reading about the alarming rate at which the disease is spreading. It must be entrained in cabin air and the cabin air must be exhausted to atmosphere as fresh air is directed inwards.

It is imperative that a fast moving F.A.A. guided Government directed program commence to engineer and install cabin exhaust air filtration equipment. This is not rocket science. Utilizing off the shelf filtration media incorporated in quickly designed and built enclosures attached to airliners exhaust ports could happen quickly and very effectively slowing down atmospheric contamination by disease that could be carried by rain on to land. And as is featured in my filter units, Ultraviolet lights kill germs as they pass through the ultraviolet light, that like microwaves that cook food, are radio waves at light wavelengths the same size as the germs that are heated and killed by the lights.

Please just do it."

Perfect scheme, Donald."

2020-02-27 6:14,This is the worst person to oversee health matters. This is the person who shut down health clinics and passed laws that harmed individuals during the HIV epidemic in Indiana. He will make this worse! We might as well have no one!

2020-02-27 7:20,So the new California case is in Solano County which is where many people from the Diamond Princess with the virus were also quarantined (at Travis AFB). It doesn’t take a genius to figure out that someone caring for or bringing food to these patients has become infected and thus passed it on to the wider community in the county.

Our President knows we're healthy as Percherons, so he can cut funding for care and medicine and we will be fine.  Just fine.

Besides, you saw how well we handled that SARS thing.  If we have to, we can arrest anybody with a fever and force them to live in a tent at the airport.

We'll be fine.

2020-02-25 18:58,Prepare how?
2020-02-25 19:03,"Universities and colleges should plan on suspending classes, so students can go home.  I can imagine the virus spreading rapidly on a campus, with roommates, dining halls and classes."
2020-02-25 19:04,"Merely telling the public that a viral disease, mild or severe, may come sooner or later and disrupt people’s lives is not enough. It is too vague for the public to take any preventive steps. Are there experts at CDC that are willing to talk and make specific suggestions (a top 10 list) on what individuals can do to be prepared and minimize their chances of getting infected."
2020-02-25 19:04,i wish these stories would explain more clearly how dangerous coronavirus is. we know it spreads quickly. but is it no worse than the flu? i think the flu kills far more people than coronavirus.
2020-02-25 19:05,"It definitely makes sense for people to prepare for this should it take a further turn for the worse.  I think having a plan for what you would do if you or a loved one got sick and what supplies you would need would be a smart thing to do.  Also, being in a position to be able to handle temporary supply shortages should that happen would also be prudent.  Even if it turns out that this was an overreaction, it's probably better safe than sorry."
2020-02-25 19:08,"I would echo other commenters in suggesting that this article would be far more helpful if it included (or linked to another article that included) tips to guard against exposure to the virus.  As it shows every sign of being a potential pandemic, many of the folks reading this article will have a need for practical advice.

The WHO has a very practical and simple set of instructions for folks seeking to prevent exposure to the virus and to deal with exposure to others who may have it.

2020-02-25 19:10,"Whatever you decide to do to “prepare,” what should be stressed is to avoid using masks unless you are ill (or immune compromised). Masks are intended for (partial) containment of droplets from those who are ill.  Those who aren’t ill should simply avoid crowds and wash their hands.

The media does a disservice by running so many photos of people around the world wearing masks as if this is the appropriate response.  If running such photos, please remind people about the proper use of masks."

2020-02-25 18:59,"As this spreads out of control, keep in mind how this lawless IMPEACHED so-called president has systematically worked to destroy this nation's ability to fight this virus.

""In 2018, the Trump administration fired the government’s entire pandemic response chain of command, including the White House management infrastructure.""

""In May 2018, Trump ordered the NSC’s entire global health security unit shut down, calling for reassignment of Rear Adm. Timothy Ziemer and dissolution of his team inside the agency. The month before, then-White House National Security Advisor John Bolton pressured Ziemer’s DHS counterpart, Tom Bossert, to resign along with his team. Neither the NSC nor DHS epidemic teams have been replaced. The global health section of the CDC was so drastically cut in 2018 that much of its staff was laid off and the number of countries it was working in was reduced from 49 to merely 10.""

2020-02-25 19:02,"Trump is always prepared to blame someone else (maybe Obama), so no need to act.   If that fails, prepare for a good healthy dose of propaganda.  And if all else fails, prepare for all unwanted news to be stamped 'Fake News'.   I wish us all luck."

2020-02-25 19:03,"Trump will probably fire Azar by tomorrow morning for warning US residents to prepare for the worst. Already Tucker and Rush are bleating that the Coronavirus is being hyped to punish Trump. Kudlow is saying, ""It's practically contained."" Does he also play an epidemiologist on TV, as well as being an ""economics"" czar?

I suspect each state and municipality will be on its own. Trump will be too preoccupied firing CDC doctors and blaming President Obama and the Deep State for making him look bad."

Of course we're NOT prepared!  

And what should we expect in light of the leadership at Heath & Human Services by the likes of Alex Azar, a Trump appointee, of course, whose Wiki bio describes him as ""an American attorney, politician, pharmaceutical lobbyist, and former drug company executive""  

Doctor or medical training?  Nah, who needs that, when you're dealing with epidemics and fast-spreading infections, right?

And notice Trump's Twittering hiatus: if it was some ""outrage,"" like crooked crony Roger Stone being convicted, the Twitterer-in-Chief would be burning up all bandwidths with outrage and comments...

Meanwhile, facing the biggest public health emergency in decades, he flies off to India to court yet another authoritarian ruler, view the Taj Mahal with Melania and spark anti-Muslim riots around the country.  Spending millions of tax dollars to take another vacation at taxpayer expense.  How much money have we spent flying him and his family on these trips?

Clearly shows his priorities and the health of the nation isn't one of them.  Would love to see the entire travel party quarantined on their return.  Maybe that will get his attention."

Forgive me if I’m not reassured."
2020-02-25 19:01,"Senator Kennedy pressing the HHS secretary for an answer to an infection estimate is absurd.

As an epidemiologist, there are so many factors which go into producing a real, scientific estimate (we don't even have a specific R0!) that it would be nonsense to provide one that isn't factually based. Not that I expect the Republican Senator to care about factual answers based on science.."
2020-02-25 19:02,"It will be severe in the US. About half the population lives in developing-country conditions under an inept, corrupt and nepotistic central government with no desire nor motivation to protect the health of anyone who’s not one of their supporters.

For tens of millions of American citizens there is no sick leave protection, no health insurance coverage, nor adequate sanitation given the high cost of rent for the working class.

Within the US there are at least two mid-size  countries comparable to Iran or Italy in median income and government corruption. The virus will likely spread even more than in those separate countries."
2020-02-25 19:11,"Considering the economic impact and possibly widespread panic that news of a Pandemic threat can lead to, the CDC must have pretty solid evidence of what is in the store for the global population. As far as preparedness, make sure you stay informed enough to distinguish between proven practices (i.e. wash your hands, avoid crowds, etc) and snake-oil."
2020-02-25 19:14,"Americans are usually resilient, and adaptable and I hope this will be true even in the face of a remarkable lack of preparation for this crisis.

I'm most concerned about how the president hollowed our our health agencies, and defunded critical departments such as the CDC.

Maybe the comming weeks and months will finally convince him that science and expertise can't be rebuilt overnight, so it's best to keep a nation fully staffed for health emergencies like COVID-19."
2020-02-25 19:17,"It would be really helpful if our government would carefully and fully inform the public ASAP what steps and measures they should be taking NOW to prepare for this. People need to be prepared in case their city or town is put on a lockdown. They need to have adequate amounts of food at home. They need access to masks in case they need to go out or to a doctor or hospital. They should have enough prescription meds on hand so they don't run out or have to go to a pharmacy with all sorts of sick people there. 

Parents should prepare to have their kids at home; stock up on books, puzzles, stuff to do if cooped up inside. That goes for adults as well; adequate stock of chocolate! ;-)

People need to know this ASAP so we don't have a hurricane style panic and people descend on the stores and clean them out."

2020-02-25 19:18,"People would do well to understand that 'flu' is a generic term for multiple influenza subtypes.  These are all summed up together to give a fatality rate (0.1%).  The coronavirus is one virus with a higher fatality rate, thus far, than the combined influenza total.  This fatality rate may change, but from the cases they have logged, it is ~1-3%."
2020-02-25 19:19,"The administration and the country should have started preparing for an outbreak weeks ago. It was absurd to think the United States wouldn’t be affected and infected. It’s terrifying to Congress tell the CDC they don’t think the Trump administration is ready.

So the CDC is telling us to prepare. What exactly  should we be doing?"
2020-02-25 19:19,"Not only has this country done nothing to prepare for the inevitable, but Trump has fired the people in charge who could oversee such a crisis! I can’t imagine how our country could cope. Blockades on all the interstate highways? Close all airports? These measures are done elsewhere but how could that occur in all the big cities and small towns in the US?"
2020-02-25 19:20,"First and foremost the government needs to work in a bipartisan fashion to combat this apparent pandemic, because this is what the coronavirus seems to be.  Are we prepared?  Could we do something before a panic sets in?
 
When I read statements from, Senator John Kennedy, Republican of Louisiana, asking for an exact number on people expected to be infected, I could see the bureaucratic wheels screeching and turning to a halt while the hospital beds fill up and it is too late.  

Rumors of cases are already out there, leaked by hospital personnel, here and there in NYC. Are they rumors?  It's just a matter of time before it truly becomes alarming, and maybe rightly so, or do we go the route of China and just sweep it under the rug?

Dr. Anthony Fauci of the National Institute of Allergies and Infectious Diseases mentioned it would take up to a year/year and a half for an inoculation against this disease.  That seems too long. 

We need to act fast and in cooperation with each other not only in the US, but in the world.   The finances are there, we need to spend it wisely and now.  We have great scientists who with the joint action of other world scientist could possibly undo this menace."

How do we protect those close to us - at home, at school, in the workplace, in crowded spaces?  Is there anything preventative?  Is it best to stay home if we get sick or should we take ourselves to the ER?  So many questions and nobody trustworthy to give us answers.

Do they mean to stock up on masks?  I thought that was a no-no.  Maybe it would be worth asking people to rethink any travel plans they have over at least the next few months and to be especially vigilant about hand washing, not touching your face, and staying home and keeping your kids home if feeling the least bit sick.

You see?  That's exactly how ignorant people attempt to discount scientific predictions.  They demand exact figures be specified from early scientific projections.  If the figures prove inaccurate (and they certainly would), they discount the science as ""hoax"" or garbage.

2020-02-25 19:22,"What has our government done to prepare for coronavirus? Did they immediately end flights from affected areas? Have they put in place national emergency medical care centers for poor and under-insured people (the vast majority of Americans, btw)? Have they actually quarantined people for minimum 14 days returning from areas affected, rather than advising those people to self-quarantine? No. Because money is more important than human lives to people like Trump and his corporate buddies.

On another note, one of our neighbors, an HIB big tech guy, has brought 5 elderly relatives to America to visit until the coronavirus risk is over. We ran into all 7 of them at the store a few days ago. One of the elderly had a cold (or something) and he was coughing without covering his mouth, wiping his nose with his fingers. This kind of lack of awareness about best hygienic practices is not unique to any one nationality, but to a majority of humans who do not seem to understand (or care to understand) why best practices are important.

2020-02-25 19:29,"Senator john kennedy's question regarding the number of expected cases exposes the ignorance of these republican cult troglodytes.  Rather than trying to make debating points, they should be questioning: 1) what treatments seem to be working in other countries, 2) are we communicating, profession to profession with other affected countries, 3) are our health professionals making progress on delineating asymptomatic infection rates, population susceptibility phenotypes, rapid diagnostic tests, 4) how are we communicating diagnostic and therapeutic recommendations to our local health departments, 5) how are we communicating with the public in order to reduce panic which is obviously occurring despite a fairly low case fatality rate?

The obstructionist republican cult is the last group of leaders to cope with the present health care system.  Ignorant, compassionless, authoritarian, individuals make poor caregivers or leaders.  They refuse to believe scientific fact and prefer to find guilt rather than solutions."

First do basics: make sure you have plenty of soap and cleaning supplies around. Always wash your hands. Wash before you eat anything or prepare food. Wash after touching communal stuff (gas stations, atms, etc). Don't shake people's hands. offer a fist or elbow bump. Bow politely. If you can't wash, then hand sanitize. 

May sure you have regular medicines around to mitigate symptoms if you get sick, fever reducer, mucinex, etc. no one really knows how to treat it but if you have a mild case I think its fair that you treat it like a cold. 

If you get sick stay home, and make plans for how to have food/ etc dropped off to you. Don't go out. If you have to go to a doctor call them and warn them first if you think you have it. 

If you have a pre-existing condition that requires meds, try to make sure you have plenty of those on hand in case of supply disruption.

Make childcare backup plans in case school gets closed. Find out if you can telecommute. 

Practice social distancing, and be a good neighbor. 

And wash your hands!!!!!!!! (also all this advice works for flu season, but Americans are cavalier about illness. If you get sick, just stay home.)"

The more people we can keep at home, the better. Remember that a large number of service sector employees have no paid time off, no sick leave, and no health insurance. These individuals will keep going to work until they are VERY sick and get sent home--they have no other choice. Then we have those with no or inadequate healthcare.

Talk to family about the risks as you understand them. Practice not touching your face in public, wash your hands thoroughly, and think of what you and your loved ones will need to be as prepared as reasonably possible for a time when such preparation would be more difficult. This may turn what might otherwise be panic into resolve, so that you sleep better. Good sleep is an excellent aid to the immune system. 

As a resident of the Pacific Northwest, I have done what I can to prepare for a subduction-zone earthquake in the limited ways available. Yes, I could move, but moving in search of a place where there is no risk of any kind is just a way to exhaust oneself in folly. We are all here as guests. For those things beyond our control, worry does zero.

Educate yourselves about prevention of all droplet-transmitted pathogens and be honest about whatever symptoms you may experience, then act accordingly-for the benefit of your own/family’s well-being as well as your community."

Seems to me that all you can do is wash your hands frequently and follow the normal common-sense protocols for avoiding and not spreading colds/flus. I'm going to stock up on some Lysol wipes for use at home, use the wipes provided at the supermarket for wiping down cart handles, and in general become much more of a germophobe than usual. If it appears around here, I'll be staying at home a lot more, so I'll stock up on some canned, packaged and frozen goods. 

Really, what else is there to do, folks? Let's get a grip."

2020-02-25 20:03,"This ominous warning actually represents a quantum leap in how our responsible government agencies speak to the public about health hazards.

For many years, the tendency has been to reduce public panic and anxiety by playing down possible dangers. Eventually, when the the hazard arrives on our doorstep, an even more disorienting flood of facts is finally presented.

The current stark warning, despite the inevitable concern it will cause, is the kind of honest appraisal that is often missing when politicians play their faux-heroic card and promise things that simply are out of their control.

Now, the challenge will be to let some of the best infectious disease specialists in the world do the talking and hope that -- in the midst of a life-threatening health crisis -- our half-witted President will keep it zipped."
2020-02-25 20:04,"The Trump administration looking totally unprepared and in chaos? What a surprise. 
But also, if there are 800+ confirmed cases in South Korea, most of them stemming from people who are members of that church where its members believe that disease is all in your mind, and so they're coughing and sneezing all over each other, doesn't that make the statistics look a little better? South Korea has a population of 51 million. It's not that I don't take this very seriously - I do - but thousands of people die every year from influenza."

Alex Michael Azar II, the United States Secretary of Health and Human Services, is an attorney, politician, pharmaceutical lobbyist, and former drug company executive. He probably has no experience helping anyone below the rank of CEO. He has no idea what to do about an infectious disease epidemic. He is a case study of why expertise in the government is a good thing unlike the present gang of imposters.

The response is pathetic. Basically, they are telling us that a lot of people will be infected but no one knows how many. They have said that this epidemic was going to happen no matter what. They have offered no advice to the general population. 

The CDC has hardly showed the leadership necessary to mobilize a population to avoid causalities that could number in the thousands if not hundreds of thousands. There has been no  communication even about the symptoms associated with coronavirus: what to look out for. Would anyone know where to go to get an appropriate mask? If anyone looked at what happened on the cruise ship, the ventilation system would be immediately suspect as the means that the disease spread. Just like Legionnaire's Disease, an epidemic of a lethal respiratory illness in 1976 which is still around today.  One intervention was to make sure the air systems were pure. Anyone consider that with Coronavirus. 

Just do something!"

Trump decided to keep ""invaders & undocumented immigrants"" out of US by building a Border wall, costing $11B and growing. Viruses & infectious diseases arrive in our country and NO WALL CAN PREVENT THEIR ARRIVAL.

Trump's Administration and Cabinet officials is populated by individuals with little or no grounding in scientific principles. It is a cabinet whose daily job is to boost the ego of Trump and help him engage in lawless and corrupt behavior. Given the pandemic's reach; instead we have a collection of witch doctors and voodoo practitioners dressed in suits. 

The last major national emergency was Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico. Recall Trump's solution: tossing paper towels. Maybe Trump will issue an executive order declaring hand wipes and sanitizers. Trump is a germaphobe, but Corona Virus knows no boundaries.

Incompetence, corruption, and disregard for law aboundswith Trump. Feel good?"

He runs around telling everyone that “we have it under control” regarding covid-19.  No, we don’t.

Trump is the worst sort of incompetent around - one who doesn’t understand his weaknesses (and when he does he masks them or blames others), thinks his competency is far greater than it is, and just plain lies.  He reminds me of the Black Knight - “just a flesh wound!”.

Sorry Trump, with matters of pandemics, there are no do-overs.  Listen to your experts for once and check your vanity at the door.  Many lives depend on it.  Possibly even one your own family.  Just do the right thing."

In 2018 in his zeal to erase everything Obama, trump fired the entire pandemic response team chain of command and never had them replaced.
Don’t worry, whatever happens, this administration will find some epic clown-grade way to botch it’s response.
In their haste to evacuate US citizens, the State Department already stuck a bunch of people who they knew were infected with the virus on a plane full of people who were not infected, despite the protest and advice of the CDC. 
This administration knows better than everyone and they don’t believe in science, common sense or any form of responsibility.
You can bet that if the CDC officials get in the way or step the toes of the clown parade members, the head clown will replace them with a toady who will parrot his nonsense.

While the president worries about his own reelection prospects, and cuts funding to the CDC, the rest of us worry about the nation's health, and the health of those around us.  Even large companies are cancelling participation in meetings in San Francisco.  Even they appear to know more than we do.

Congress:  Do your job!  Tell the American people what you know about the risks involved here.  There is no reason that you should have access to information that might save lives, while leaving the rest of us in the dark."

It's not just the complete and utter ignorance of that statement coming from our Secretary of Commerce that is so infuriating and dangerous,  it is how it symbolizes what  a complete and utter bumbling administration we have that is totally ill equipped to handle any crisis of any sort."
2020-02-25 20:17,"Trump's budget proposals:
Nearly $39 million cut from the CDC’s Center for Global Health funding
More than $85 million cut from the CDC’s National Center for Emerging and Zoonotic Infectious Diseases
34 percent from global health programs at USAID and the State Department, including a 58 percent cut to the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria; and $27 million cut from funding for neglected tropical diseases, from $102 million to $75 million (26%), and a $61 million reduction in bilateral malaria funding (8%)
And while the White House has carved out $50 million for global health security funding for disease detection and emergencies like the current COVID-19 outbreak, that boost comes at the same time they cut international HIV/AIDS programs (by about $58 million) and some global immunization programs. We risk increasing the rates of these diseases around the world and within U.S. borders as well.

Diseases do not stop at geographical or political borders. Every American deserves to have their tax dollars go to work protecting them from infectious diseases and keeping the U.S. at the forefront of scientific innovation. Scaling back when we face threats of deadly viruses and will continue to face them in the future makes no sense at all. Global health is America’s health, and prudent investment is the wiser path to take.

Or would you rather have a wall to stop the spread of disease and migrants, as Trump seems to choose?"
2020-02-25 20:19,"It would be helpful to have information on precisely what we should prepare for and how to do so.

If it's that bad, and a matter of life and death, I am sure school will be put on hold, or a parent can decide on their own to have their child stay home. It's not here yet.  Let's see what happens before we panic. I assume significant disruption means you are going to be indoors at home.  No runs to the grocery.  No work. No school.  Stay inside and play video games and read books and hope you have enough food and water until you can peek your head out again. Major disruption would be contracting the virus or having a family member who is afflicted.  Maybe I should be worried but I'm not."

Not only the Chinese report all the new and total cases, do they also report on suspected cases, people under medical observation, deaths, and recovered cases (which are over 22000). Yes, the cronavirus epidemic is under control in China. It is Iran, Korea, Italy that should worry us."

Has anyone looked into the spread of this virus by, fleas,roaches, mice, rat's, pigeons, seagulls and other common wildlife in cities, cruise ships as well as other scavenger species in our common environments?
Those pests can include bedbugs, lice, mosquitoes, fleas on pets as well as other things. Then there is the possibility that with a droplet spread it could be in HEVAC systems as those are common denominators in most modern construction.

2020-02-25 20:19,China lies about everything and this is one of them. Cases will increase because the government wants people back to work ASAP. Iran also lies about everything and this is one of them. Infections will greatly increase there. Though getting any information out of North Korea is difficult they too lie about everything. There is some information out there from brave souls that say infections there exist in large numbers. Italy has an epidemic as well as does South Korea. Japan is trying to contain the disease but will probably fail. The CDC is right. The cat is out of the bag. The spread of coronavirus is inevitable in America.
2020-02-25 20:27,"I am not a ""science denier"" but out of a population of over 327 million in America, 14 confirmed cases of Covid-19 infection is almost nothing.  Likewise, even if a vaccine is developed - that is no guarantee that it will resolve the problem.  There are 50,000 people who die from pneumonia each year even though a vaccine is available."
2020-02-25 20:27,"The healthcare system, which already struggles to cope in a regular flu-season, is going to just break. As of Feb 11, analysis of confirmed cases in China showed 13.8% classified as “severe” and 4.7% as critical (with critical being defined as including respiratory/ organ failure and/or sepsis).  If US community based transmission is now viewed as highly likely (if not inevitable) then does this not point to hospitalization rates way, way above anything that the current healthcare system could cope with? How is $1.25B or even $2.5B of emergency funding going to be anything other than a drop in the ocean? Money aside how can agencies respond rapidly enough to cope with what could be a unprecedentedly vast bulge in demand for hospital / ICU care?"
2020-02-25 20:28,"They are worried about the number of ventilators? Ventilators and ventilated patients require a huge amount of skilled labor and additional supplies. They are not just a plug it in and forget it part of the equation. I worked in various types of ICUs for a number of years and I think folks in the government don't have a clue how inadequate our health care system will prove to be if this thing turns into a big one. Folks will be learning about the concept of medical triage in a hurry. The number of people presenting to ERs that have symptoms but not actually infected with this particular virus, alone, could severely tax the system which already frequently runs at capacity. I, also, did ER triage for a good while. It is not unusual for hospitals  to divert patients because they can not handle more, now."
2020-02-25 20:29,"It is probably here already. Do the math.  The incubation period can be as short as two days and as long as two weeks.  That means when a case shows up out of nowhere, you will have no idea 1) where the person contracted it and 2) who might have been exposed. That by itself is bad enough. In our modern jet age, people can circle the globe and come into contact with numerous other people who are also circling the globe leading the possibility of exponential spread.

Worse, we now know that some asymptomatic people shed the virus (i.e. are contagious). Meaning that measures like checking temperatures before allowing people to board airplanes do not good. That means that any person who had contact with another person who flew out of China (whether that person was sick or not) of the most casual nature possible--say, for instance, he or she picked up a salt shaker that the person who flew out of China handled moments before is at risk. Since plenty of non Chinese visit China, just avoiding Chinese looking people will do no good. That US businesswoman may have just finished signing a big agreement in China. And you picked up the salt shaker at the airport after her. Congratulations. You now have coronavirus.  Even though you have no risk factor. And you are now about to take it home with you.

This cannot be contained any more than flu can be contained. We need to focus on treatment."
2020-02-25 20:32,"I recall the active and vocal role the CDC took at the beginning of the AIDS epidemic, before the illness had its first of many names, or was even known to be viral. The top-rate talent at this agency worked to 
- track every case of the disease
- map its spread
- determine its target populations
- document its means of transmission
- educate the public about the likely ways to avoid infection
- develop an accurate diagnostic test
- prevent public panic.

I see nothing from the CDC today that approaches the level of effort or professionalism the American public should expect from the agency that, less than 40 years ago, was a world-class example of medical crisis management.

Budget cuts have taken an awful toll, many among the talented staff left for the private sector or other public health organizations... The gold-standard emergency response -- as proven by their bungled actions during the Ebola outbreak a few years ago -- is beyond the capability of the government entity entrusted with this critical function. It looks like we're going to have to figure out appropriate protocols on our own.

It's not at all heartening that the company I work for issued a travel moratorium between the U.S. and both China and Japan several weeks ago -- well before the first word on anything travel-related came from the CDC. They're supposed to be LEADING."
2020-02-25 20:33,"I keep reading about the use of surgical face masks, which are only useful to when worn by the sick to protect the well. Just seems like a lot the TSA processes - there more as theater, to make the public feel that something is being done, but in reality not very effective and a big waste of money, resources, and, for those who wait in line for them, exposure/waste of time. Just like the temperature-taking, now that we know that folks can pass it before even realizing that they are ill.

I have to say that my sneaking suspicion is that if we were actually doing tests of everyone in the cluster areas, that we'd find that many, many more people have had the virus with little affect, and might not have even known that they were sick. 

Because China has no real non-hospital care, and hasn't done (or hasn't revealed) the results of just testing everyone to see general population prevalence, I hypothesize that we are only seeing those who get really sick, either because of pre-existing conditions or who are unfortunate and get a very strong bit of the virus. 

I think this is like some new flu, and I can't imagine quarantine stopping either of those. But for flu, we have vaccines, as we will have for this... 

So I am pretty dubious about the benefit of these wholesale quarantines. 

Anyway WASH YOUR HANDS!"
2020-02-25 20:33,"From all of the news I've read, there is no definitive handle on how this virus is spreading.

  What I did learn is that airlines do not clean or sanitize seat belt buckles, and the drop down trays are only cleaned if the plane is on the tarmac overnight.  That fact alone leads me to hold off on any airline travel in the coming months. 

I would imagine that preparation means extra medicine, non perishable foods, and anything else you typically go to the store for on a regular basis.  In other words, I'll try and hunker down."
2020-02-25 20:35,"It would be helpful if mass media (like the NY Times) disseminated information about:
1. The recommended precautions citizen's need to take to avoid getting infected
2. The usual symptoms that are first exhibited by those who are infected
3. Steps to take if symptomatic.
I know one can go and look into WHO, CDC or other sources to get this information, but people look on-line to unreliable sources that can create confusion and panic. So as a public service announcement, the media can do a lot to help. It could save lives and help avoid pandemonium."
2020-02-25 20:12,"This is another test of this administrations competency in facing shifting global change that are outside our control. He will not able to toss rolls of paper towels at it,  though he and his brethren in the White House and Congress will likely bloviate and espouse lies, take little to no responsibility, and let the most vulnerable suffer or perish.

Unfortunately, the President is never reassuring about anything, he can rile people up but he cannot calm them. This may prove to be nothing more serious than the average flu virus or maybe a lot worse. The risk is that unknowing can lead to worst case scenario behaviors which lead to secondary consequences which are very poor. 

The stock markets are panicking out of fear of the economy being affected, fear not actual empirical evidence. Just the fear could precipitate recession at this point. 

If people understand the risks, they are less likely to panic. Trump needs to be assuring the country, not leaving it to figure it all out as they might."
2020-02-25 20:33,"Trump asked for $2.5 billion so far?  

I hoping any funding bill states that a wall on the Mexican border will not keep out coronavirus and hence should not be used for that purpose."
2020-02-25 20:14,"It’s something I never thought would affect me. Now, living in Koreatown in LA,  the largest Korean community outside Korea, where there are visitors from Korea, coming and going , I’m starting to think more seriously about the virus. With the worldwide air travel that many of us engage in, I hope, (but doubt) planes are being disinfected. Let’s all hope a cure is found soon and deaths from the virus decrease."
2020-02-25 20:15,"We as Americans listen to the professionals, the doctors, scientist that know how to combat the virus.  Politicians like Azar who only want to give credit to trump lack all credibility.  trump listens to scientists like dr. Limbaugh who opine that its a cold being blown up to cost the metal of freedom presenter the election.  Our president says this will blow out by the spring!  Have all republicans lost their minds, do they all believe that science is the enemy.  This virus is on the cusp of becoming a pandemic, let the professionals address the issues keep politics out of this for our sake and sake of our children!"
2020-02-25 20:21,"Many people are asking what should we do to prepare.  The answer is that we as individuals cannot do anything except be vigilant personally , washing our hands, monitoring our own and our family’s health, avoiding crowds if we are able.  Our government and health care system have to take the lead in combating the virus’s spread and care for the sick.  God help us!  It’s too late now to put in place a national health care system so the uninsured can seek medical attention without fear of bankruptcy.  Too late we will recognize that universal health care is not only a human right but a national security necessity."
2020-02-25 20:31,"So far the response has been:
1. Severely restricted travel  through a few selected airports with about 50,000 people screened(China and a few other governments said we were panicking).
2. Airlift our citizens out of Hubei and some other locations and quarantine them
3.  Treat the sick
4.  Offer our best virologists and epidemiologists (rejected by China).
5. Vigorous laboratory testing
6. Track any PUI's (Persons under investigation of the disease)
7.  Travel restrictions/warnings for select other countries.

These are the escalation procedures set up by the CDC and other government agencies - I'm not sure everything should be a conversation about Donald Trump pulling levers and managing all this from some room at the White House.

If you are all so concerned, try reading something on one of the many public health websites."
2020-02-25 20:17,"I think ""thoughts and prayers"" is what is called for. Hey, we KNOW it works for gun violence, maybe it will work for pandemics."
2020-02-25 20:42,"I am certain that the Trump administration has sent out the call to mobilize all those ready to coordinate efforts to a) communicate facts to the public; b) set up treatment facilities; c) set up methods of containing the virus; d) working together with other nations.  

Not."
2020-02-25 20:14,"As much as I dislike this administration, criticizing the Homeland Secretary for not knowing how many people will be infected is ridiculous. This article mentions a few times that no one has any idea yet. It could be very many, very few or in between."
2020-02-25 20:40,"Maybe people will finally listen to what we have been telling them for years for flu, SARS, and everything else. If you are sick stay home. It's that simple. If everybody would do it it would slow the epidemic spread. Usually novel epidemic viruses lose virulence within a few months, as is already happening in China, so we just have to slow things down until then. Oh, and get the flu shot. And the measles vaccine if you don't have it. And the pneumonia vaccine if you are old enough for a senior discount."
2020-02-25 20:10,"This pandemic will hit America particularly badly for many reasons. We have few hospitals at all, much less ones equipped for this highly communicable disease, in most of our rural areas. The hospitals we do have in urban areas are not equipped for the numbers of patients that are predicted and we have few buildings that can be repurposed for such needs even for those who can afford such specialized care.This in addition to our notoriously expensive and exclusionary healthcare system which may well leave Americans sick and dying in our streets. And, no, I’m not exaggerating. 
The economic effects are already showing to be as awful as the medical ones. I’m just one person with curiosity and a computer and I’ve been concerned for weeks about what’s coming for us. My biggest stress is that none of our leaders appear in the least concerned about this. Where are the mayors, governors, public health spokespeople who should be issuing guidelines and directives to get us situated to take on this threat? The CDC basically tells us to wash our hands and shelter at home. Trump says it won’t happen here.
Am I the only one ready to pull my hair out in frustration?"
2020-02-25 20:26,"I believe a reason Trump won in 2016 was enough people thought we could afford a Trump. The economy was okay, Middle East conflicts were on a low simmer, no other major crises people were paying attention to…so why not take a flier on the supposedly billionaire developer / reality tv personality / political neophyte? After all, what’s the worst that could happen - right? 

Well, we might be about to find out. I sincerely hope we don’t have a national public health crisis here but if we do it’s not going to get fixed on Twitter. We will be relying on the most incompetent and erratic administration to hold the executive branch in our lifetimes to demonstrate effective political leadership. People will get a real world reminder that experience, competence, and good judgment matter. It’s a shame this country always has to re-learn these things the hard way."
2020-02-25 20:13,The U.S. is never adequately prepared for the year onslaught of the influenza virus.  Why in the world would anything be different  if the the coronavirus should hit this country?
2020-02-25 20:18,"Believe it or not, everything can’t be seen through a political lens. The truth is we don’t know much at this point; it doesn’t seem to be particularly lethal, the young don’t seem to contract serious illness, and, if past history is a judge, this corona virus will become even less lethal over time before burning itself out over the next 2 months.  Less fear mongering and making sure you’re deploying resources in a sensible way seems to be what leadership should do at this juncture. I think Trump will be well suited to this."
2020-02-25 20:26,"For three years, we have been very lucky: although we have an incompetent and disorganized administration, the United States hasn’t been faced with a serious crisis. I had always thought that if the worst happened, it would involve a military or international diplomatic crisis. It is ironic that now it comes in the form of a virus that knows no national borders. It can’t be bullied by the President’s tweets, it doesn’t respond to rosy information from the White House. Even after Trump juiced the economy with a debt-funded tax cut, the virus can lay low a country’s stock market, currency and production supply chains by infecting workers. The relentless purge of the government’s professional staff and savage budget cuts to the CDC and other agencies have left us vulnerable to attack by a stealthy microbe. Seems like fitting justice for the Trump administration, but all of us will be collateral damage."
2020-02-25 20:30,"The only thing Trump is interested in is how the coronavirus will impact his re-election chances. Therefore the ‘Nothing to see here folks’ tweets. Viruses do not respect borders. When the virus becomes a true global pandemic, then we will truly see that the Emperor has no clothes."
2020-02-25 20:25,I was hit hard by the flu just yesterday.  Fever at 102.8.   The health care people did not test for the virus and didn't sppear to care.

2020-02-25 20:12,"Wait. We are going to rely on science and facts now?  I didn’t think that we were doing things that way.  Our administration says that climate change is a hoax by activist scientists. And the facts found by our intelligence services are not truth, not to be trusted. In fact, this administration has been drastically cutting funding for the CDC, including big cuts to funding for study of global outbreaks/disease.  So who are we supposed to believe? Oh tell us, Great Stable Genius,  ye who knows all about everything.  Tell us The Truth."

2020-02-25 20:49,"In tonight’s Democratic presidential debate, I hope the panel asks the candidates how they would prepare the country for an outbreak of COVID-19. The contrast with the Trump Administration should be stark.

Health care has been a winning issue for Democrats. And Trump keeps showing his incompetence and indifference. (New Coronavirus may even give a boost to Bernie and M4A.)"
2020-02-25 20:52,I am amused by Ms. Messonnier's suggestion that individuals reach out to their school superintendents to ask about their plan. I can imagine superintendents everywhere unplugging their phones after the first 1000 calls.

2020-02-25 20:51,Trump knows more than anybody and he says USA is prepared and virus will not have much effect. Soon he will tweet that this scare is just another deep state hoax to hurt his re-election chances.
2020-02-25 20:09,Give that even if you have health care coverage you have at least a $25 co-pay not to mention even more if you go to the ER and what ever else you insurance will say is not covered I wonder how many sick people will just not go to see a Dr even with symptoms until they are too sick and have contaminated countless others. Co-pays and other fees should be waived until we know this thing is under control.
2020-02-25 20:55,"An Australian professor and virologist, Dr. Ian Mackay, has posted useful, practical information, about how to prepare for potential spread of the coronavirus: <a href=""https://virologydownunder.com/so-you-think-youve-about-to-be-in-a-pandemic"" target=""_blank"">https://virologydownunder.com/so-you-think-youve-about-to-be-in-a-pandemic</a>/

Dr. Mackay, and a number of other epidemiologists, are frustrated are with the degree to which the WHO and other governmental agencies are playing down the real risk of spread and telling people to remain calm without offering sound advice on what people can do to prepare themselves. Check out Dr. Mackay's twitter, as he is reposting interesting information from other experts. Absolutely stay calm; the death rate associated with coronavirus appears relatively low, so there really isn't a need to panic or horde face masks or anything else. But there are some useful things we can do to reduce the risk of infection and weather disruptions in the supply chain. Hopefully governmental agencies at the state and city/town level will start thinking through response plans, and communicate that information with the public. I fear that political appointees at the CDC will limit/slow the degree of preparation and communication at the federal level."
2020-02-25 20:42,"With the spread of the Coronavirus, the chickens have come home to roost in a big way for Trumpism.  Want to know how NOT to prepare for a pandemic?  Just follow how Donald Trump has made America great again: deny and defund science and appoint unqualified lackeys in key healthcare posts in the government.  
The Coronavirus pandemic is the reason why reason, logic and intellect matter.  The best the reality TV king, Donald Trump, can do is tell the Coronavirus, ""You're fired.""  Good luck with that."
2020-02-25 20:50,Waiting for trump to fire any CDC official who isn’t putting a good spin on the situation.
2020-02-25 20:10,"I have ZERO confidence in the Trump administration to handle any pandemic, much less an outbreak of coronavirus here in the US.  Apparently--and I know that this must come as a total and complete surprise to absolutely everyone--the only actions the Trump administration has taken is to shield Trump himself from people like Mike Mulvaney who had a cold and so was ejected from the India trip.

We must remember: Trump, himself, is the state.  Trump, himself, is the law.  And Trump, and only Trump, is deserving of great health care and shelter from the teeming hoards."
2020-02-25 20:27,"Trump is already lying non-stop about the virus, including a claim that there are only 10 cases in the U.S.

And he might fire anyone in his administration at any minute if they dare sound an alarm to the American public.

And we all know Trump will continue to lie to Americans if the virus continues to spread in the U.S., he sees the virus in political terms rather than as a public safety issue.

And regardless of the fact that he ordered the gutting of the CDC, if this becomes an epidemic Trump will blame Obama. Or immigrants from the southern border. Or the Democrats in Congress."
2020-02-25 20:58,and exactly how are we supposed to prepare for a virus for which there is no vaccine?
2020-02-25 20:59,The CDC is not the agency needed if there is a major outbreak in the US. Local first responders will handle it. That is how this country is setup. Your State and local department of health will guide locals in setting up treatment centers and supplies. Local officials will make the call about shutting schools and work places. Local officials will direct people where to go and what to do. Shutting down transportation may involve some Feds. Governors will call up the national guard if needed. Paying for it all will come later and the Feds will have a roll there.
2020-02-25 20:39,"Do we have enough masks is the question...and the answer is ""Of course not?"". THAT is somebody who needs to be fired.  And send Larry Kudlow packing with him.

3M can't possibly manufacture enough N95 masks to protect the entire planet in time for this. I'm heading to the ACE Hardware down the street right after lunch to pick some up just in case.

Having Trump and his incompetent administration ""loyalists"" in charge of this makes me very nervous. If they can't handle a hurricane in Puerto Rico I doubt they can deal with this. I can see people wrapping paper towels around their faces now."

Oh gee, so glad that won't happen here in the United States with Trump and Fox News in charge of informing the public and keeping us all calm and being thoughtful of each other and staying home if we are sick.  

Guess we can all breathe a sigh of relief knowing that our nation--the most powerful country in the world with the highest GDP--is well prepared to handle a coronavirus epidemic, especially now that Obama is no longer president with his affordable health care nonsense.  

Thank goodness we live under Trump and GOP rule.
Given the livable wage in this country and our excellent health insurance that only misses covering 27.8 million people, plus the Trump cuts to Medicare and Medicaid, good thing we don't have to worry about all those struggling Americans out in the work force afraid to go to the doctor for fear of the costs and trying to make ends meet even if they are terribly sick."
2020-02-25 20:52,"I grew up in India and this comments section reminds me of Indian newspapers where, no matter what the news story is about, the comments would be little more than laments about the state of affairs in the country, and how politics was the root of all evil.

2020-02-25 21:02,"I fear that we may at long last be held accountable for our inattention and disregard for the trials of the rest of the World. We in this Country, in spite of our own shortcomings ,have mostly lived in a protected bubble. “That” mostly happened “out there”. Now we have leadership that is incapable of recognizing or accepting the truth, and totally incompetent at providing any leadership, much less in a crisis. We may finally suffer the results of our lazy inattention. Can some one tell how we need to be ready, what steps do we need to take, what accommodations do we and our families need to make? A little specific information would be helpful in place of broad generalities."
2020-02-25 21:07,"The CDC says: In the event of an outbreak, communities should plan for “social distancing measures,” like dividing school classes into smaller groups of students, closing schools, canceling meetings and conferences, and arranging for employees to work from home.

That's why the economy is going to take a hit.  Slowing the spread of the virus means that people stop working.   That's exactly what we saw in China and see in Korea and Italy.  

If I were to hazard a laymans prediction, it is that the US will have rolling lockdowns of hot spots, entire towns and transportation hubs, until such time as the population becomes  immune or a vaccine is created.  The lockdowns will slow the spread of infection some but hobble the economy a lot.

And that Trump is going to somehow steer a few billion that should be directed to epidemic relief to red states and The Wall while blaming everyone but himself for the clumsy government response."
2020-02-25 21:07,"Just some thoughts on what can be done about the emerging pandemic:

Outside China, the mortality seems to be around a few percent. So provided the public health system (hospitals) keep functioning properly, the impact on society seems surmountable (although obviously a tragedy for the deceased). 

If everybody would become ill at the same time, then the public health system would become overwhelmed, also because hospital staff becomes affected. System dysfunction would lead to high mortality.

So it is important to delay the pandemic in order to keep the public health system functional. This may also give time to develop countermeasures such as testing therapies and to increase the capacity of the public health system.

Delay seems possible by closing mass meetings, schools, etc. Travel could be restricted. 

In a previous comment, I proposed that patients who recover and have a suitable background ('draftable' age, education) should temporarily be kept att the staff of hospitals in order to increase their capacity. This should be done with guarantees that the temps would not lose their regular jobs."
2020-02-25 21:08,"Just as China tried to keep the lid on this outbreak. The current administration is not being forthright in the information that we are receiving. After three years and 15000 lies and ""alternate facts""  we are now expected to believe? Why was the CDC so eager to release suspected carriers from quarantine ? Is the government trying to thin the population?"
2020-02-25 21:10,"Epidemic of this deadly virus is now essentially certain because the US government's travel ban was late to be imposed and too narrow in scope.  Also helping the disease to become a worldwide pandemic were other governments who refused to impose a travel ban due devotion to their political correctness, so devoted that they choose instead to roll out the welcome mat for a deadly disease which causes widespread severe suffering and a high fatality rate among older people.

More outrageous is the behavior of American companies like 3M who make N95 face masks.  The general American public has been and continues unable to buy these masks to protect themselves from this deadly virus.  Why?  Because the American companies making them are sending them to China instead of selling them to Americans.

The are sending them to China when the US is about to suffer an epidemic of a disease which comes from China and has been brought to the US and the rest of the world by travelers from China.  Outrageous disloyalty and callousness toward fellow Americans health and lives!

China is a manufacturing powerhouse.  They should make their own masks instead of some of the low value stuff they send to the US and the world.  American companies should be selling their masks to the American public, not China."
2020-02-25 21:11,"Our current economy, designed a lot like the Hunger Games, does not bode well for getting through this pandemic unscathed. How will the millions of Americans without health insurance survive this crisis if they are unable to afford to see a doctor when experience the symptoms of COVID 19?  How will hourly employees dare to miss a day's work to get the help they need?  Oy."
2020-02-25 21:11,"So now, after firing the ""disease czar"", because the position was created by Obama, and cutting the CDC's budget, the administration is asking for at least $1.9bn to be taken from other programs to fight an outbreak.  I wonder if any of that money will come from the monies diverted from the defense budget to fund Trump's wall?"

2020-02-25 20:59,"Thank you, Nancy. I am now prepared."
2020-02-25 20:50,Preparedness step #1: Ignore anything Trump and the WH have to say on this matter. Step #2; Ignore anything anyone on FOX has to say.
2020-02-25 20:29,"Who knew that by ""America first,"" Trump meant cutting CDC spending so Americans would be ""first"" to go!"
2020-02-25 20:32,"The virus will likely follow a classic S -growth curve.  After outbreak starts,  Korea and China took 7-10 days for the curve slope to reverse directions ( the point when ds/dt < 1) The key variable in the s-curve is the time that the virus acceleration goes to zero, so when s’’ = 0. Sorry for being a math nerd but I have been relearning my calculus to help my daughter with her AP Calc."
2020-02-25 20:45,"Outbreak now pending in U.S.
I already knew that...heck, anyone who's paid attention to the impeached one saying there's nothing to worry about knew it was time to begin worrying.
That's his tell. 
Whatever he says...believe the opposite to be the truth."
2020-02-25 20:48,The article says the disease appears to be under control in China. It is not. The Chinese communists are hiding and partnering up with WHO to give a false impression that they have contained it. The communist lies and secrecy resulted in the virus getting out control in China and now it is threatening the world.
2020-02-25 20:49,"Thankfully our 'really smart' and ' stable genius'  President  Donald Trump knows more about the coronavirus than any virologist in the C.D.C,.

And what Trump doesn't know he can rely on Jared ' Hidden Genius' Kushner along with the Trump Minister of Propaganda aka Sean Hannity."
2020-02-25 20:51,"It is about to become a worldwide epidemic.

It happens every generation or so.

You can wear all the silly face masks you want, but if you're exposed to a contagious person, chances are....."
2020-02-25 20:29,"no worries folks - the president says ""it will go away when it gets warm"""
2020-02-25 20:44,Might be a good time to stockpile canned food at home in case your sick and can’t go out or if Caronavirus becomes so widespread that there’s disruptions in food delivery to markets.
2020-02-25 20:58,"I have no cofidence at all in the Trump Administration to protect our citizens from COVID-19. Facemasks and probably even hand sanitizer are sold out across the country and even worldwide due to people hoarding these very needed supplies and I see no word from the government that it is going to supply us citizens wth any of these items for our own personal use for protecting ourselves against this virus.

Plus the lack of affordable healthcare in this country will cause many Americans to pass away from this awful virus because they can't get the proper medical care they need in order to fight off agianst this virus. I realy hope this will not happen though. And then going back to this country's Administration not being ready for COVID-19 at all and we have an impending disaster in the makingin the near near future.

God help us all. : ("
2020-02-25 21:01,Best ways to prepare for virus is to have 1) affordable healthcare and 2) sick leave. America has neither.
2020-02-25 21:06,"Anna Wintour & her fashion crowd attending the runway shows are potential patient zeros in NYC. They need to be quarantined! 
Really. No kidding.
This outbreak should be the death knell in jetting around the world to look at a bunch of clothes. Hey, I can't put my groceries in a sanitary plastic bag while others get to drive in giant SUVs & fly to see fashion shows and attend destination weddings. Not fair. We as a society need to change and accept the fact that traditions and the old way of doing stuff has been proven wrong by science. I am not a young person but I want big change that is only for the better. Eating wild animals etc is done with. And to think that one selfish person with a the craving for bat soup or pangolin hash is responsible for this catastrophe. And cruise ships should become extinct today. Saying ""no"" is so hard in todays world. Parents either don't say it or mean it when they do. And no to anything that effects the entire world. Money & profits  can not phase out common sense. If you are offended- tough- get over it."
2020-02-25 20:31,Trump likely will attack and/or remove these CDC officials.
2020-02-25 20:59,"Since the U.S. has turned it's back on science, I'll send along my thoughts and prayers."
2020-02-25 20:59,"That money is a small drop in a large bucket, whether it's this or the next epidemic/pandemic.  We've been warned.  Now that we are (some of us) waking up to the need for action, how about taking some of the money stolen from intended uses to build the * Big Beautiful Wall *(sic) and starting to rebuild the agencies  that are needed, and that have been defunded for the last three years .  Too bad nobody's asked the Buffoon in Chief whether he knows about walls' ability to stop viruses."

2020-02-25 20:59,"All food service workers should be ordered to wear gloves and masks and not talk when they are handling food. This is true without the Coronavirus' eminent threat, and should be practiced all across the food service industry immediately."
2020-02-25 21:02,We have a president with no interest in science.  He has defunded public health and has a history of muzzling scientists within his administration. This is scary.
2020-02-25 21:02,"So our future head of the CDC, Rush, has said this virus is like ""a cold"" you know he has been to a doctor so his is an expert in  communicable diseases. Meanwhile our President appears to be more concerned about reelection compared to the people. Dems need to be a calm, transparent, educated, and proactive voice of reason if they want to someone in their party to become a global and national leader."
2020-02-25 21:02,"It wasn't long ago that the Chinese Government was upset because of the actions taken by the United States as the Covid-19 outbreak gained steam.

Now we have people saying our government is ill-prepared, too little too late, and worse - as if any action by any government would truly be effective for a new/novel virus outbreak that is spreading around the world.

What's disturbing is the growing number of people who think that the Chinese have been completely open and honest about this new outbreak - which would have been less likely to have occurred had they honored treaties signed and their own laws.

What's really disturbing is those who want to compare Covid-19 with the seasonal flu - as if they are some kind of expert on the subject. Why is Covid 19 a threat?  Google antigenic shift, then run the latest numbers... guess what?

Personally, I look at this as nature's way of culling the herd and if this doesn't do the job, perhaps the next one or the one after that will.

What I find frustrating is those who think that a vaccine will be available in the next 12 to 24 months.  I have my doubts about that.  Even if we do have a vaccine, it will be limited supply that's only available to healthcare, military and government officials.  It won't be available to the poor living in the slums of (insert name of country/city here).

I would also predict that the antivaxers will be screaming the loudest for the future vaccine if this growing epidemic turns into a nasty pandemic!"
2020-02-25 21:04,"Oh please! 

Leave politics out of this. Trump, Trump, Trump! Aren’t you guys tired of complaining about Trump? 

If a community is hit by COVID19, it is up to the community to make all necessary arrangements take precautions and deal with it. 

All Trump or any President can do is pay."
2020-02-25 21:05,"A few thoughts:
* any best practices for prevention? Basic common sense hand washing? 
* Roughly 30,000 US troops are stationed in South Korea and Italy. What measures are being taken to protect them and their families? 
* I hope the CDC takes a page from the intelligence agencies and shares info with the public. We can’t trust this administration to tell us the truth. 
* I hope this does not tamper voter turnout this weekend and on Super Tuesday."
2020-02-25 21:14,"For all the people asking what to do, please heed the article. Figure out now how you will handle closure of your child's school or daycare if that happens. Figure out now what you're going to eat if you can't go out grocery shopping for two or three weeks. Figure out now what you'll do to fulfill business needs if employees and customers cannot physically come to the workplace for weeks. Buy masks now in case there's an outbreak in your area."
2020-02-25 21:14,"In May 2018, Trump ordered the National Security Council's Global Health Unit shut down.  This was following Trump forcing out the head of the equivalent agency from the Department of Homeland Security and disbanding his team.  With Trump's cuts to the Center for Disease Control, they're only working with 10 countries when they used to work with almost 50.  Trump also tried to cut the U.S. Public Health Service Commissioned Corp, which fights infectious diseases, by 40%, but Congress blocked him.  (Foreign Policy magazine).

Trump has dramatically reduced our ability to fight coronavirus.  His $2.5 Billion request is less than half of what Obama asked for the fight Ebola.  And it takes almost a year to develop a new vaccine at scale."
2020-02-25 21:18,"I think that the N95 masks (they are often pale blue in color) are the same ones we used to use in the hospital where I worked (I've been retired for 3 years now). If so, I remember that we each had to undergo special training to ensure a good fit. These masks have a thin wire component at the top edge that has to be pressed around the bridge of the nose, to make sure no air is escaping. Then you test for a good fit by blowing into it. The masks also come in different sizes. 

From some close-up photos I've seen of people in China and other places wearing these masks, it doesn't look as though they have been properly fitted, which makes them rather useless. If and when there's a big outbreak in the USA, I'd like to see health care workers providing proper training on how to fit the masks to each person's face. Perhaps a video emailed to everyone, Facebook, Instagram, NYTimes video, etc?"
2020-02-25 21:18,"COVID-19 is transmitted from surface-to-surface contact. To minimize risks of disease transmission, wash your hands before all meals and snacks as well as regularly throughout the day. Carry hand sanitizer and use it after touching surfaces in public environments. Sanitize surfaces with bleach (or other similar cleaning product) wipes. Minimize touching face/eyes when possible. Clean out cuts in skin with soap and water regularly and try to keep cuts covered with bandages when in public. This virus is not currently believed to be airborne-- masks will do little to nothing in helping prevent infection."
2020-02-25 21:19,"Government is always reacting, no matter who is in charge. It is impossible for a government to accurately predict the future. How many warnings did the government receive before 9/11? Look at the consequences of the government's intervention in Libya in 2011, consequences that the world is still living with today. Faith in a government response to any disaster is misplaced. In the end, you are on your own, and can only really depend on the informal networks in your lives. Government can help with that, but it cannot replace it."
2020-02-25 20:59,"There seems to be a lot of confusion, so let's be clear: the problem here isn't the US' handling of this. The US seems to be doing a great job of containing the coronavirus right now, thought it's always a little hard to be 100% sure. What's alarming the CDC is that the rest of the world isn't managing to contain the virus, and once it's spreading like wildfire everywhere else it's just not going to be possible to stop it spreading throughout the US too. 

Also, I really wouldn't suggest using this in support of Medicare for All. One of the big contributors to this is that Italy's medical system, one of a few in the world that's structured like that already, screwed up and helped spread the virus."
2020-02-25 21:01,"""Brownie, you're doing a heck of a job,"" v.2020."
2020-02-25 21:02,"The CDC has good guidance for average citizens. I suggest that the Times print this kind of guidance daily

[Thanks EC and Republicans, you deserve what you get, the rest of us do not.]"
2020-02-25 20:25,So ironic that the plague is coming to America under the watch of a germaphobe President.
2020-02-25 20:51,We await the vector map indicating the epidemic blooming in Alabama...sheeesh
2020-02-25 20:51,"Wait -- this virus can't jump the big, beautiful wall, can it???"
2020-02-25 20:25,I am shocked by the profound stupidity of Sen. John Kennedy demanding to know “an exact number” of Americans expected to be infected.  That’s a dumb question even by his standards. Every Congressional swearing-in ceremony should be preceded by an IQ test.
2020-02-25 20:41,"I’d be happy to die now, knowing that DJ Trump will most likely be re-elected."
2020-02-25 20:45,I assume a tweet will soon be sent from The Airer Of Daily Grievances denying their claims
2020-02-25 20:27,"Wait, What??!! Trump said if we just hold out until spring weather comes, coronavirus will die out on its own.  The CDC is just another deep state plant of disloyal public servants.  Trump's administration will weed out these disloyal purveyors of disinformation and the nation will be great again."
2020-02-25 20:52,Wash your hands frequently.
2020-02-25 20:53,"Trump will probably fire anyone who says we need to prepare! That's ""disloyal,"" right??"
2020-02-25 20:56,We are now all in the clown car being driven by Trump and the republicans for a cliff and they have locked the doors!
2020-02-25 21:07,Build a wall?
2020-02-25 20:39,Donald Trump will fire him for delivering bad news.
2020-02-25 20:54,"Relax, Mother Earth is just fighting back..."
2020-02-25 21:00,Trump is already drawing up plans to fire the CDC staff who dared to contradict our dear leader that all is not as he says when it comes to covid -19.
2020-02-25 21:07,"Obama did a much better job of containing the Ebola outbreak, as well as communicating with the public.

Much, much better."
2020-02-25 21:12,Maybe Donnie should come home and stop trying to sell Condos in failed real estate ventures.
2020-02-25 20:29,"This is exactly what you get when the only criterion for appointed office is blind allegiance to Trump.  While saying nothing as the administration gutted the ranks of people who actually knew what they were doing, almost every single Republican senator voted to confirm nearly every one of these useless apparatchiks who are  now just making up responses as they go.  How many people will literally die due to Republican's gross incompetence?"
2020-02-25 21:04,"There are days like this where I wish that we did not have an idiot in the White House, someone who can be trusted to be honest, to tell us like it is, and to actually lead us in a potential crisis.

But I have a question that perhaps has been answered, but has received little attention.  With the amount of regular flu going around as well as colds with flu like symptoms how can we tell if our illness is not the coronavirus?  And how much more severe is this disease compared to those other viruses?"
2020-02-25 21:06,wait until the rest of the world watches Americans die of this virus because they can't afford to go to the doctor. talk about a laughing stock.
2020-02-25 21:07,"In other words, get used to it."
2020-02-25 21:12,"MiamiHerald news reported a person came back from the affected area and voluntarily went to take a blood test, he has the (useless) Trump-Paul Ryan Basic Insurance, he did not contract the covid-19 virus, he need to pay $1400 out of the pocket. Now ask yourself, even if you suspected you might have contracted the covid-19, will you go for a $1000 test? Welcome to the Great America health care system. For those that have platinum health care insurance like the Senators having, the COVID-19 prefer people that are older than 60 years old... Hey Mitch & Individual 1."
2020-02-25 21:12,Uh-oh. They told the truth. Look for Trump to fire them tomorrow. Maybe later today.
2020-02-25 21:13,"Folks, we can only prepare ourselves and our families to the extent possible. Would U.S. citizens accept a large city being quarantined with travel cut off? Nah. And remember Ebola? The big issues with Americans not wanting to be quarantined? the home quarantined lady who left and went thru a drive thru? Yikes!

So. Assume you have to remain home for say 3 weeks What do you need? Paper goods (lots of tp). Dry goods (rice; beans; canned meat; peanut butter; etc.) Clorox (or multiple containers of Clorox wipes). Prescription medications. OTC meds like aspirin, ibuprofen; Mucinex or other cold/flu type meds. Personal care products. N95 masks just in case you have to leave your house. 

Lots of garbage bags, disposable gloves; can for disposal of potentially hazardous waste - if you choose to go outside to get your mail/paper/delivery you need to wear gloves and carefully remove them for disposal. 

This is just common sense and what I am doing. Oh ... don't forget the wine,"
2020-02-25 21:07,Kudlow says all is good and contained. The same Kudlow who said the economy is fine with no recession in sight just a few months before the great recession.  I don't trust these guys.
2020-02-25 21:12,Now that they’ve gutted the “deep state” the superficial state take care of this crisis.
2020-02-25 21:12,"It’s scary to imagine how Donald Trump will react should this epidemic expand as some are warning. Will he lead in a manner that promotes cooperative, socially responsible behaviours? Will he refrain from issuing inflammatory tweets that cast blame on his enemies? Will he be the unifying force that brings together epidemiologists, doctors, scientists and social planners necessary to combat mass infections? Will he back off and let the experts do their jobs free of his interference and I’ll informed micro managing? In short will he be Presidential?
If you can answer yes to any of these questions, I’d really like to see your evidence."
2020-02-25 21:08,"Will Trump purge CDC officials who are not holding the White House line on the corona virus? If not, the White House would be in effect admitting that scientists can be right, such as on climate change."
2020-02-25 21:20,Is it likely that Coronavirus will spread unknown in the USA because so many people cannot afford to go to hospital ? By the time the spread is detected will it be too late ? Just wondering.
2020-02-25 21:22,So what is the solution to prepare for this? The article did a great job of filling me with fear but did not provide any actionable steps I can take to prevent transmission.
2020-02-25 21:26,"Wearing masks could be making the situation worst.
1 The virus particle easily passes through.
2 The heat and moisture produced round the mouth and nose of the wearer, are the conditions in which the virus thrives."
2020-02-25 21:34,"I don't know what any of this means. Are they predicting more deaths? If so, what should be done about it? Work from home? Wear a hazmat suit? What are the chances of different types of people getting it (young, middle aged, elderly) and how can they protect themselves? What's worse about it than the regular flu? Why does Trump continue to fire experts in infectious diseases and lie about the situation? What information can we glean from China? It's all doom and gloom but no one is really saying anything."
2020-02-25 21:35,"Everything from this president is what he believes, what he has heard.  Nothing from reports/data that he has read...he doesn't read.

Interesting the Senator Kennedy was frustrated during the hearing from the ACTING secretary.  So many acting, no one permanent and in charge."
2020-02-25 21:38,"Very unnerving. Not feeling so great about life right now, to be honest. So my father worked for the CDC as an epidemiologist, and traveled the world on their malaria and HIV/AIDS teams. A great-uncle was part of the original team studying Ebola. During college, I did two summer internships on the CDC campus. A hotel in Atlanta just recently reopened after Legionnaire's sickened multiple people. Atlanta is home to the world's busiest airport. . I've stopped taking public transportation since this story broke - a decision that I don't feel very good about at all. I hate the idea of cocooning myself off from the world, but it looks like we're headed that way.  Best be prepared."
2020-02-25 21:47,"The new Coronavirus has spread widely in Hubei Province, which has a population rivaling that of France. The incidence there is decreasing after draconian measures were introduced to control it.  The CDC has not yet released their test kit to be used outside of the CDC itself.  In order to control the virus in the US, we will need a few critical tools:

1. A test to determine if someone is currently infected and sick from the virus (may be ready in mid-March?)
2. A test to determine if someone has been infected & if that proves immunity (no sign of such a test yet)
3. An effective vaccine (in development, about 6-18 months before it will be ready)
4. An effective strategy for social distancing when infections are common in a community but herd immunity is not yet established (we know a lot about this and can work or learn from home in many cases)
5. An adequate supply of ICU beds and equipment if the rate of severe diseases is really 20% among infected people (surge capacity has been planned for flu pandemics)
6. Excellent genomic surveillance to track the virus as it spreads in the country (we have the capacity and it is happening now with foreign & US cases)"
2020-02-25 21:48,I read in a European Paper that the CDC noted that the testing kits in the US that were distributed are defective and at most 5 states have proper kits. why hasn't this been reported here?
2020-02-25 21:51,"This is exactly the crisis for which trust in government is essential and, yet, absent. We will all rely heavily on the press to keep the public accurately informed."
2020-02-25 21:52,"The possibility of being quarantined at home for days or even weeks seem like a scene from a science fiction movie. This is worrying. Families with small children, elderly and sick family members should think about stocking on medications and formulas."
2020-02-25 21:53,"I ordered N95 masks from a local environmental goods supplier on January 21 when I first read about the virus. I figured, why not be prepared? I never got them. Yesterday the supplier cancelled my order and refunded my money. I assume all production is now devoted to health care contexts. They are for sale on Amazon for 80 dollars for a box of 20...seems like price gauging to me. The Wash Post and NPR had an interview with a mask producer who says he has been warning for over ten years about the outsourcing of mask production to China...the US is in for some hard but important lessons about supply lines and the value of universal health care."
2020-02-25 21:53,Have they put any odds out yet on how much of that 2.5Billion trump will skim off to go to his re-election wall?  I say there's a better than 50-50 chance.
2020-02-25 21:54,"This points up the need for our scientists to develop broad spectrum anti-viral agents that can fight potential epidemics while they culture the virus and develop a vaccine.  It also points up the need to be able to develop a vaccine in a matter of weeks and mass produce it instead of the longer time tables that we have now.  And, last but not least it's absolutely critical that the volume of misinformation about these potential life saving vaccines be silenced at all costs. 
Governor Cuomo did the right thing when he made flu shots, pneumonia shots and other vaccinations readily available at the local pharmacies.  This makes it so much easier for people to get a flu shot rather than having to make an appointment with their doctor.  Now, they can just walk into their local pharmacy and get vaccinated on the spot. 
And, last but not least people need to improve their personal hygiene and that means washing their hands with soap and water after using the bathroom.  I was at a popular restaurant not long ago and this individual was in the stall. When he was done he thought nothing of walking out into the restaurant without washing his hands.   Anything he touched would have been contaminated with e coli.  This lack of soap and water is going to cost many lives in this upcoming epidemic.  Soap and Water goes a long way to prevent the spread of illness.  And staying home from work when someone is sick is incredibly important as well."
2020-02-25 21:55,"This disease started in a Socialist country where the government controls most enterprises, including health care, journalism, the internet, travel etc. Low public health standards and government censorship may have contributed to the problem. As the leading Democratic candidate touts Socialism, it’s important to understand that concentrating power in the the hands of government officials can lead to tragedy on a global scale."
2020-02-25 21:57,"We still have N-95 masks from the recent firestorms in Northern California. It was so smoky, with so many dust particles in the air, that we couldn’t go outside without one. 

This is reminding me of Chuck Wendig’s best seller from last year titled Wanderers. A good read now, though it’s an extremely long book. 

Not sure what else to do but wear the mask, wash hands and stay home. 

The other day I was at the Apple Store in Santa Rosa. Right at the entrance was a bottle of Purell hanging on a stand for the public as they came in. 

Lord help us."
2020-02-25 21:58,"It is unacceptable for the CDC to reverse course and issue such a dire statement like that. To not have a test plan ready. 

As Americans we have to learn through experiential techniques. We will find out how effective a government distracted really is. How “lean and mean” works in the field. The unintended consequences when pharma companies are not paid for developing vaccines?  

You can’t force people to work without funding or a plan. And hope is not a strategy."
2020-02-25 21:58,"In public places what's the optimum distance between people to avoid catching it from others? What if there is coughing or sneezing without a mask?

What about public transport? Would it be better to avoid the gyms?

How long can the virus last on things like door knobs?

What precautionary steps can be taken to avoid catching it?

Last but not the least, how do we balance the individual needs vs the community. If there is a run on protective items and food supplies by some resulting in empty shelves, what about the rest?

And, we still don't know the incubation period for sure."
2020-02-25 21:59,"Unfortunately, people and governments who only begin preparing for the virus now are seriously behind the curve. Masks and gloves are on back order at the vast majority of suppliers and have been for weeks. They are available to the average person mainly on EBay at incredibly inflated prices set by people who quickly bought up most existing stock weeks ago. And most masks people might be able to find are single use, disposable masks that lose effectiveness if people attempt to reuse them. Figure 1 mask per day per person at minimum, and even them most should disposed of and replaced if you need to remove them during the course of the day. Government will now be buying up the bulk of what is available for health departments, hospital personnel, government officials and employees deemed indispensable. Even orders for hand sanitizer have already skyrocketed. Many, if not most, of these products are primarily made overseas, and supplying the home country will take priority over exports. If you can’t get these supplies, buy lots of bleach and learn how to use it properly to disinfect- at least I think that is still widely available.  And ask the government, for what its worth, to make some emergency orders to deal with the price gougers."
2020-02-25 21:43,"CDC should reach out to all American people to teach them about all aspects this epidemic.  This new coronavirus is human to human transmissible; the virus can be spread by contact transmission, aerosol transmission and...the infected patient can be asymptomatic and still spread the virus (the so called invisible spreader), patients’ stool can carry the virus, the virus can survive on metal surface for how many days...Knowledge and information is the best tool to fight and protect oneself.  Congress, do not leave the common American people in the dark.  Health information should not be classified."
2020-02-25 21:16,"I find reporting on this virus to be so woefully uninformative.  The flu has killed tens of thousands of people in the US in the last few months. It is spread, it would seem, the same way the Corona virus is.  But clearly the press and the authorities think we should be more worried about the virus that has killed a few thoudand people than we are by the annual flue that seems much more deadly.  I am willing to take at face value that there is something worse about the corona virus, and that we should be especially concerned.

But if that is the case I don't understand why the Times and other news outlets that have  these alarming headlines can't explain why.  The many more people who die from the flu are just as dead as someone who dies from the corona virus. So what is it about the corona virus that makes it so much more of a concern than viruses that kill more people and that are already here.  Is the corona virus more painful or something like that? Or is there something about it that remains unknown and therefore more potentially dangerous than other, less novel but more common and more lethal viruses?

If anyone from the Times sees this, an explanation digging into this a bit more precisely would be helpful.

Thank you."

A conundrum indeed. s/"
2020-02-25 21:38,"It wasn't long ago that the Chinese Government was upset because of the actions taken by the United States as the Covid-19 outbreak gained steam.

Now we have people saying our government is ill-prepared, too little too late, and worse - as if any action by any government would truly be effective for a new/novel virus outbreak that is spreading around the world.

What's disturbing is the growing number of people who think that the Chinese have been completely open and honest about this new outbreak - which would have been less likely to have occurred had they honored treaties signed and their own laws.

What's really disturbing is those who want to compare Covid-19 with the seasonal flu - as if they are some kind of expert on the subject. Why is Covid 19 a threat?  Google antigenic shift, then run the latest numbers... guess what?

Personally, I look at this as nature's way of culling the herd and if this doesn't do the job, perhaps the next one or the one after that will.

What I find frustrating is those who think that a vaccine will be available in the next 12 to 24 months.  I have my doubts about that.  Even if we do have a vaccine, it will be limited supply that's only available to healthcare, military and government officials.  It won't be available to the poor living in the slums of (insert name of country/city here).

I would also predict that the antivaxers will be screaming the loudest for the future vaccine if this growing epidemic turns into a nasty pandemic!"

No concerns about the shortages of medical supplies. No thoughts for the way he's insulted allies who now need to come together. Nope.

Not a care in the world for the low wage workers who cannot afford an hour, much less a day, off.  Nary a thought for the fact that those are the very people handling our food, babies, kids, parents, pets and that that desperation will force them to show up for work sick. 

 Who cares that his tariffs have jacked the price of importing masks through the roof? Sure you can get 20 for $100 (used to be for $12 or so) but it now costs $130 for shipping. Go figure. Someone sure did (figured out how to exploit others pain and misery, that is).

This is basic information that’s been available from the CDC & WHO since SARS if not before. 

The time to make a plan is not when hospitals are overrun, grocery stores depleted, people in a panic. The time to plan is now. 

Don’t expect this administration to help you; trump will only help himself & his re-election. People will be dying around him & he will blame the Democrats for this, not his incompetence. We are on our own unless you believe him that it’ll go away when it gets warms & that it won’t come here & a vaccine is imminent."

Maybe they ate them too, my uncle said.  

A doctor on Nextdoor suggested we use a nasal gel to prevent a lot of germs from entering our noses. Cut down  risk of infection when in public. 

I wonder if flights into the US from Iran and Italy will be monitored, curtailed, and passengers screened if indeed these, and emerging other, countries have signs of a pandemic? 

I wish our government instilled confidence, by rehiring smart and experienced people to lead a pandemic response team. Not amateurs. The likes of which we have now, who went against the CDC recommendation to keep infected Americans (from the Japan-based cruise ship) from flying home with healthy people on a plane. The CDC said the State department's decision to allow the sick to ""mingle"" by being on same plane with healthy passengers bound for America will, to paraphrase, likely cost Americans more virus spread, more lives to suffer; and as a result, the economy to plummet.

If Trump's so worried about the economy and stock market, he should hire the best and brightest now! Meanwhile, the rest of us must vote for the best and brightest candidate to lead our country.

I said ""Ma, look, stock up on some food and books to read and just prepare to wait this out"". I suspect she won't  be alone in her inability to imagine this.

2020-02-25 21:38,"October 2019 the flu started to hit the US.  Since then over 25 million people have exhibited flu like symptoms.  There have been approximately 14-16 thousand deaths with about 104 of them being children.  Why isn't this being reported like the coronavirus.  Every year cruise ships report outbreaks of flu.  Remember Ebola?  That was supposed to be a pandemic.  What happened to that.  In July 2019 it remained a global concern but very little press on that.

This disease, like many others, is going to kick around among those in our communities who can't afford health care and will continue to make workers sick for much longer than necessary. Resulting in further disruption and stock market tumbles.

Before a Pandemic
•	Store a two week supply of water and food.
•	Periodically check your regular prescription drugs to ensure a continuous supply in your home.
•	Have any nonprescription drugs and other health supplies on hand, including pain relievers, stomach remedies, cough and cold medicines, fluids with electrolytes, and vitamins.
•	Get copies and maintain electronic versions of health records from doctors, hospitals, pharmacies and other sources and store them, for personal reference. Get help accessing electronic health records.
•	Talk with family members and loved ones about how they would be cared for if they got sick, or what will be needed to care for them in your home."

It will sweep across all the continents and sicken populations and kill many. But far more dangerous to our well being is the overreaction that follows.  Since it cannot be contained, and probably 90% of us will possibly be infected at some point, we should just give up on trying to contain it.  Lets just treat it like a severe flu season.  Othewise, food and gas deliveries will stop and panic will break out.   EVERYTHING should continue commercially and, like the flu, the sick should stay home from work.  We should all wash our hands.   Inevitably we will all know people who may die.  But that is better than living in a Mel Gibson movie.   That is a far bigger threat!"

2020-02-25 21:54,"Plenty of people are asking what they can do personally. The following is listed on the CDC website:

* Stay at home when you are sick (yes I know it can be transmitted when asymptotic but I am sticking to within our control here)

* Cover your mouth when you cough and sneeze with a tissue or something like that 
(not your hand for plenty obvious reasons)

* Wash your hands often with soap and water

* Implement social distancing at schools, work, and public events

* Clean frequently touched surfaces and objects like door knobs

The below is my added commentary not from the CDC:

If you do get sick… don’t panic. You don’t need your immune system additionally compromised due to excess stress. Knowledge is power. Most (that means you) stand a good chance recovering. Tried and true-- rest, fluids, electrolytes, vitamins. Keep you airway clear, decongest, and fever reduce especially in the littles. Febrile seizures are not to be messed with. No sweating it out (I cringe when I hear people advocate for this)! Manage your symptoms. Care for yourself. Educate yourself.

I’m not particularly religious, but may god be with us. Regardless of what you believe, we’ll need some prayers too, and increased funding for the CDC (which should have never been cut but that’s another comment all together)."

2020-02-25 21:36,"Some practical tips on how to start preparing, since the CDC isn't really giving much:

- start practicing proper hand washing immediately. It's incredible how many people DON'T wash their hands (especially after using the restroom), or don't wash them for long enough. 20 seconds is a long time. Get into the habit now.

- start practicing NOT touching your face. We touch our face WAY too much. It takes practice to make it a habit and conscious awareness. 

-start using other means to touch potentially contaminated places: use your elbow to hit the elevation button. Open doors with your shoulder/elbow. 

- *slowly* start building an emergency reserve of food and water to ride out a potential outbreak in your area. You should do this anyway for natural disaster prep.

- practice good hygiene when coughing - into elbow, into tissue. NOT into open air or hands. It's amazing how many people will just cough EVERYWHERE.

Build good habits now BEFORE there is a widespread outbreak. In the best case scenario, you are just prepared without needing to be."

When you need to use it, take one cloth and fold it in half and place one or two squares of toilet paper also folded in half and blot.  Put toilet paper in toilet to flush and keep the cloth in a small dish under the cabinet or sink, wherever you can reach. Wash the cloth when you think you should. Do not flush the cloth.

It needs to be soft enough to squeeze.  Fill it with warm water before you sit down, then when you've done your business, wipe with toilet paper and rinse with the warm water in the squirt bottle.  Wipe or blot with toilet paper that has been wetted with the warm water, until you are clean. Do not use the little towel square for ""number 2"". You don't want to spread e coli germs so take no chances.  Urine is sterile if you are healthy so no need to freak out about that.

Trump and his incompetent GOP sycophants don't believe in science and can't handle this. They mocked Congressional Democratic demands for more money and resources to battle the Coronavirus for over a month.

Trump already dismantled much of our national and local defenses against pandemics, then just pushed for more massive cuts, including a 12% cut to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and a 10% cut to the Centers for Disease Control.

CDC cuts were nearly a billion dollars for 2019 alone. Trump proposed destroying federal and state public health protections after cuts already crippled capacity to respond to a dire health crisis. 

Trump sought to cut $30 million for public health preparedness and response and over $78 million for immunization funding, including the development of immunizations against new deadly strains like Coronavirus. Finally, Trump tried to kill funding for epidemiology research at the state level.

This seems very short sighted - we would have to have a bad outbreak before anyone would be tested at all. How come Cambodia and Iran can test hundreds of people and we can’t? Are other States doing tests? Is the CDC considering accepting tests from patients with symptoms but without China travel? Do the CDC tests work?

2020-02-25 22:53,"How to prepare, in response to another writer:
Read the CDC website, which has valuable information for the public.
People need to adopt good handwashing practices and control of droplets from sneezes and coughs.  
Activities that are outside the home and not strictly necessary will need to be restricted, if the virus is demonstrated in your community.  For example, my daily trip to the gym for exercise is not going to happen.  I can exercise at home.  
People who can work from home offices may be asked to do so.  There will be more teleconferencing. 
People can still go to stores, such as supermarkets, for necessary transactions.   
I suspect that many physicians will restrict access to their offices to necessary and urgent matters until the virus levels in the community go down, and patients with symptoms of COVID, especially those with a fever, will need special pathways for care.  I also expect that hospitals will restrict surgical procedures and other treatments to those that are urgent.  

I suspect that people are going to keep larger distances between themselves and others, in respect to the recommendation to remain apart more than 6 feet.  For those exposed to the virus, self-quarantine will be necessary.   For anyone who may be ill and who would self-quarantine, friends and neighbors may be enlisted to go to the store for food and other supplies, or delivery services may be useful.  

Masks will become commonplace.

We start with common sense here."

I understand from other sources that COVID-19 genetics is more like a flu virus than SARS or MERS, and thus the greatest health risk is for immuno-weakened individuals. COVID-19 is more contagious because more people enter lengthy periods as infected but likely to survive. SARS and MERS were much more lethal and thus the infected people were less likely to be alive long enough to infect others. Appreciate verification and additional insight. This information will help with preparation and expectation for those in communities once the virus enters. It is clear that it's higher risk to travel given how contagious it is, again since it seems most people live for some time thru their infection and illness, and thus can infect others."

So, what reasonable preparations could one possibly make?  Stock pile food supplies, toilet paper, other necessities?  And then what?  Stay barricaded in one's home?  For how long?  And what about one's employment?  Stop working?  Working from home although many do not have that option.

Thanks for the warning CDC officials but unless they have a sure fire plan of attack and a remedy if one is unlucky to contract this virus, then anything else they have to say is almost meaningless is not hollow.

Perhaps what might be helpful is a list of symptoms to look for and what to do if one suspects he or she has contracted the virus.

This should tell you all you need to know.  This President has been self involved during wildfires out west, severe storms and flooding in many states and in Puerto Rico.  He has shown no inclination to lead, and no ability to empathize with Americans who had to endure horrendous conditions, lost their homes, lost their lives or family members.  His main concern is that fear/concern over this public health threat might hurt the economy, and thus his re-election chances, and maybe the Trump Organization's bottom line.

The same holds true for intergovernmental cooperation on climate change projected to cause the displacement of hundreds of millions of climate refugees by the end of the century. But perhaps a fundamental effort to curb the nationalist uptick that goes cozy with autocracy is to grant the ICC teeth in the fight against core international crimes, for which we should add ecocide to war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide. Any state leader, including Trump if he continues to prevaricate, ought to be held accountable for deaths from this global pandemics.

Yes, Alex Azar at the helm at HHS at a time of public health crisis - attorney, pharmaceutical company lobbyist and Trump loyalist.    Trump has cut the budget for The Centers for Disease Control - as all Republican administrations have.   We don't need to understand public health.   We need to understand that a pharmaceutical company lobbyist knows nothing about public health.  That is what we should be alarmed about.  Drain the swamp -- vote Trump out in November."

2020-02-25 23:22,"I am concerned that the evolving coronavirus pandemic will create a global shortage of critical pharmaceuticals.  The corporate offshoring to China for production of most vital medicines has created a serious national security issue. 
     China [and India] is the supplier of approximately 80% of the key active ingredients and chemical building blocks for most of the global prescription drugs, over-the-counter medicines and vitamins. The United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) charged with oversight of our drug suppliers [i.e., China], has incurred major fiscal cuts in its drug inspection programs. These cuts have hampered the agency’s effectiveness in conducting critical quality control inspections of over 1000 drug production sites throughout China making the indispensable drug ingredients. 
     Production quality control processes are lacking at many of China’s drug making facilities.  The scariest aspect is the FDA is staff-handicapped for the task of conducting the critical periodic inspections of the growing number of China’s drug production facilities.  With the evolving coronavirus pandemic in China most of the drug production sites are likely in a shutdown mode.   Will the FDA have staff in China to resume their limited inspections of these sites once they restart production?   Relocating pharmaceutical production back to the USA must be a top national security priority and a key campaign issue for the Nov 2020 elections."

The refusal of medicaid expansion in many red states has led to the closing of many rural hospitals.  Significant portions of rural (Red) America are essentially healthcare deserts.  The brazen and unwise attempts to destablize ACA has  led to  rising numbers of uninsured people. These actions may create the critical mass that may ignite a viral epidemic in the US.  

Uninsured people won't come to the ER until they are extremely ill. And before they finally go to the ER, that they will be working in our restaurants, stores, nursing homes and offices and exposing dozens or hundreds to the virus.  

How exactly will we be able to deal with and stem the crises when we have entire communities  that don't even have access to hospitals and medical personnel?

It isn't just the loss of wages - there are ramifications for credit card debt and so on that will have ripple effects far beyond what can be easily envisioned. 

And don't expect insurance companies do do anything except bring out the clause ""Force Majeure"" to deny employers the losses they will suffer. For losses there will be across the boards."

Or, are we just supposed to lock are doors and wait for Trump to blame us if we get sick and die?"
2020-02-25 19:08,"So much of our approach to public health threats like this depends on identifying and isolating people who are symptomatic, tracing contacts, isolating those contacts, etc.... until the chain of transmission is stopped.  And that is a fragile methodology - it can work great as a first line of defense to keep a miniscule number of infected from spreading it.  

However, it's not an approach that scales well if too many people in too many places become infected.  And I've been concerned the past 2-3 weeks since it was reported and verified by Dr. Anthony Fauci that this virus is being transmitted before people are symptomatic.

We probably need to pivot towards accepting that this will be a pandemic, and to be more prepared for treating mass numbers of infected, developing a vaccine, and similar efforts."

The apparently small number of coronavirus cases in the US is not because it isn't here, but rather because we're just not testing much for it compared to countries like South Korea and Italy, which (especially Korea) often test more people in a single day than have been tested in the US in all of 2020! We simply have no idea how widespread COVID19 is in the US, but a cluster of recent anecdotes (including a Japanese tourist who contracted the coronavirus during a trip to the US and was diagnosed back in Japan) suggest that it's likely spreading already on US shores.

Most alarming are the cuts that have hampered the CDC and its diligent, dedicated staff, a major contributor to the agency's struggles to provide working test kits. A number of kits were dispatched recently to US states and 30 nations abroad, but then found to be faulty and left unused. Still worse is the outrageous red tape not only blocking independent labs from developing their own kits, but simply using already validated tests from abroad (used successfully in e.g. Japan, China, and Europe) to test Americans at home. By now this is beyond incompetent; it's gross negligence which is tangibly threatening the well-being of millions of Americans. This needs to be taken seriously as the emergency that it is."

""In May 2018, Trump ordered the NSC’s entire global health security unit shut down, calling for reassignment of Rear Adm. Timothy Ziemer and dissolution of his team inside the agency. The month before, then-White House National Security Advisor John Bolton pressured Ziemer’s DHS counterpart, Tom Bossert, to resign along with his team. Neither the NSC nor DHS epidemic teams have been replaced. The global health section of the CDC was so drastically cut in 2018 that much of its staff was laid off and the number of countries it was working in was reduced from 49 to merely 10.""

“There’s an argument that Trump can make that could help his reelection... reminding voters how Trump shifted American thinking on China, highlighting the threat posed by its communist regime and demanding that U.S. companies return manufacturing facilities from overseas.

At this point, we the nation lacks sufficient garments for healthcare workers, all of whom will need such garb.  Infection from patients to medical workers will collapse the healthcare systems and meanwhile the grifters and incompetent D Team running the White House are in denial or woefully ignorant of the threat and the catastrophe looming which will be equal 9-11 for shock and awe and repercussions economically and politically.   

Within weeks of an outbreak in the US, we will run out of masks and garments for healthcare workers.  Within a month, we will exhaust supplies of antiviral drugs.

An eighth of the time, you'll get one heads, but then both coins in the second round turn up tails. But sometimes, a string of heads causes the number of heads to explode out of control. The ""average"" number of heads is actually infinity. (Check out the St. Petersbug Paradox).

Leaving infinity aside, I tried to simulate this game on my computer a thousand times. I got mostly zeroes and ones, many instances tens or hundreds of heads, some sums in the thousands, and one that got up to 14,000. However, on the 410th iteration of the game, the number of heads reached some alarming number, and my poor computer didn't have the memory to keep calling the recursive function (listed below, in R).

Use regular masks only if you’re ill or caring for someone who is. If you have difficulty breathing, you may need to go to the hospital.

In anticipation of a sneeze or cough people need to fully cover their nose and face with the crook of their elbow.  
People need to carry tissues and use them.
The Surgeon General of the United States needs to take a leadership position.

2020-02-26 1:52,"Here is what I do know about how to be safer:  hand sanitizer really helps because it kills viruses, it must be more than 60% alcohol.  Carry a pocket sized one around with you everywhere you go.  Don’t touch your face with your hands until you sanitized them.  Washing your hands in public restrooms won’t completely clean them since the faucets are touched with dirty hands as they are turned on.  I read before that masks prevent the sick from spreading the virus, but are somewhat ineffective if a healthy person wears one, and hoarding them makes them unavailable for healthcare workers.  I have a lot of dried food such as dried mangoes, prunes etc. piled up at home, a huge case of water bottles, packs of pasta, and other not easily perishable food items.  You never know, be prepared for the worst, in case you are able to work from home, are able to stay home, have lots of food and water."

The WHO's pro-China stance has created a false sense of security regarding the coronavirus, which has claimed more than 1,000 lives around the world.

The CDC has been one of the few opposing voices against the WHO, but even they have not spoken out against the incompetence and pandering of the WHO and China.  To those people who still trust the coopted WHO, they should be wary of declarations and adulation. The WHO still continues to block the participation of Taiwan at the insistence of an autocratic regime that only banned the consumption of wild animals this past weekend.

When I heard about the WH wanting money for the epidemic, somehow, I wondered, once it was appropriated, how long it would take Trump to state that the money would be diverted to ""build his wall"".  He would state that it was an emergency and that ""the wall"" would stop the spread of the virus.   We would hear silence and the Republican senate would get on Faux news and give all glory and gravitas to Trump for being such a brilliant scientist and back his notion that the CDC were simply overeducated mucks who are a bunch of anti Trump dips.  They would have no qualms with his thinking and a good portion of Americans also would back up his decision as being ""tough on terrorists""  I hate to  admit it but, I believe this could be dooms day for many Americans.

I see what is happening here. Politicians are trying to get bigger budgets and exploiting the situation. Ban Ki Moon during the Ebola peak was asking for 1 billion for Ebola to do what?

From a decade ago: 

Using century-old tissue samples from 1918 H1N1 flu victims, the same Dr. Fauci and several others determined the fatal pathway.  As it turned out, the virus damaged the capabilities of the trachea and bronchi to flush the airway of harmful bacteria – which would become lethal, if they could reach the lungs and entrench there:

We can absolutely count on many millions of Americans going to work while sick. Add in the fact that this virus appears to spread before many people have symptoms, and you’d better stock the pantry, sign up for Amazon Prime and prescription delivery if needed. 

Stock up on hand soap/sanitizer and USE IT before touching your deliveries and mail. Keep some sanitizer wipes in your car and use them the moment you’re back in your vehicle on the door handles, steering wheel, etc. If you use public transit carry wipes/sanitizer and wear a well-fitting mask. Prepare to wipe down all your office surfaces daily as we don’t know yet how long this virus can survive on your desk/keyboard/etc. Remove your shoes the moment you get home, and yes, wipe them down—the doorknobs too. Then immediately wash your hands for 20-30 seconds. Same when you get to work. Obviously if you can, arrange to work from home.

Not the end of the world, preliminary data suggests about 80% of cases are mild, with most of the 20% severe cases in the elderly and weakened, and a 2-3% mortality.
So - worse than the Flu, - but not by much. The Flu regularly kills about 10-20000 people yearly in the US alone, and doesn't have people freaking out - it's even an uphill battle against anti-vaxxer idiots to keep immunizations at reasonable levels. 
Note also that about 30% of our usual Flu-like illnesses are actually due to Coronaviruses - same type of virus as the one causing Covid-19.
Hopefully, the interest in controlling this virus will last long enough this time (compared to say - the SARS epidemic, which had much higher mortality) to allow the completion and clinical testing of a vaccine. If that succeeds, it will simply be folded into the yearly Flu vaccine preparations. But as Fauci said today, the vaccine is still over a year away from clinical deployment, even if the development of the prototype has been massively accelerated over e.g., efforts for the SARS virus - weeks for processes that took months-years in the past."

2020-02-26 0:48,Lets see if Trump can fix this with a sharpie.
2020-02-26 2:48,"Trump has trashed health preparedness in the United States. And, like a blithering idiot, he claims that the situation is under control. It is not. We are facing a dire situation, and we are less prepared than we ever have been, and we also have 87 million people without health insurance, thanks to Trump's attacks on the ACA. Where will they get treatment when they contract this virus. 

Trump and the Republicans know he is guilty. That is why they are trying to get ahead of the inevitable attacks that will be directed against him for his incompetence. Rush Limbaugh had the gall to say that the press was ""weaponizing"" the Coronavirus as an attack on Trump. No one needed to ""weaponize"" this matter. Trump did it to himself. It was disastrous administration by an egotistical fool who will never admit his mistakes even when thousands are dying at his feet;"

2020-02-26 4:11,"Come on people you are all readers of the NYT. You don’t really need the CDC to give you a list of how to prepare in case of an outbreak of Covid-19, do you? You can all figure out what you would need if you had to stay home for 2-3 weeks: non-perishable food items, paper goods (tissues, toilet paper, paper towels), pet food and cat litter, make sure you have enough of your prescription medicines, over-the-counter drugs like Tylenol and Aleve. Think about what you would need if you couldn’t go to the grocery store, drugstore, restaurants or order from Amazon for a few weeks and make a list and go get those items.  If you want to know about first symptoms and other details of the disease, there have been several articles in this newspaper with that information.  Let’s show some self-reliance.  We know the current administration isn’t capable, we’ve got to take care of ourselves and each other."
2020-02-26 4:15,"“Some doubted the administration was prepared.”  For goodness sake, NYT, not everything is political! This administration is no more or less prepared than any other administration.  Federal response has actually been quite good. If anything, the preparedness problem is in the lack of hospital capacity and underfunded state and local public health systems.  You can’t pin that on the Trump administration."
2020-02-26 4:07,Why aren’t we hearing from the media that this is a viral pneumonia? This information would give people some perspective.
2020-02-26 3:59,"We need quick, reliable tests for coronavirus. If Trump was any kind of normal, remotely competent  leader, he would be making that happen. Instead he went off to India to visit the Taj Mahal. We are in big trouble if we do not get reliable test kits soon."
2020-02-26 4:25,I'm sure Donald Trump has everything under control.
2020-02-26 4:23,"It's really pathetic that CDC just tells us an outbreak is imminent then throw their arms up as if there's nothing they can do about it. Yes there is and the time to act is now: 

Shut down *all* international flights coming in and out of the US for the next 30 days.

The only reason we are not doing this is because of the fear of the hit to the economy. But if we end up with a major outbreak, the hit to our economy is going to be much, much worse than the temporary losses incurred by the airlines and travel industry.  This country is run by people who care only about short term profits and can't see beyond the next quarter's profits. This is extremely short-sighted, and penny wise pound foolish. 

Trump needs to step up now, show some leadership and courage, stop all international flights coming in and out of the US for the next 30 days while there's still an opportunity to stop this."
2020-02-26 4:24,"It is absolutely infuriating as a Hillary Clinton supporter to know I could have been spared this tyrannical reign had voters read the early signs of trouble.

Even if they were more readily available what stock there is should be reserved for health care workers since we won’t be getting more shipments from China anytime soon.
2020-02-26 5:08,"The real test is whether corporate ""persons"" and their political functionaries will overcome the needs of actual persons in a widespread crisis.  Will the pressures to keep the work going and the revenue coming in supercede the scientific protocols for protecting public health through quarantine?  Or is it ""when?""  How will our democracy ""for the people"" perform?   And further, how long can governments support our check-to-check fellow citizens while no one works, no revenue comes in? Perhaps this is an opportunity to re-order our priorities in the ""public interest.""  How we tax and spend might need to change all of the sudden."
2020-02-26 5:11,"I could see some variation of this scenario playing out:  Coronavirus hits the US and gets increasingly widespread the closer we get to the November election.  With all the cuts to our critical agencies such as the CDC, NIH, with all the people who can't afford health insurance,  tremendous pressures build on our institutions, medical organizations, etc.   The democratic nominee starts to look like they'll win. Trump calls a national emergency and suspends the election.  The coup is complete."
2020-02-26 4:29,China looks to have contained the virus.  Will the US be able to do the same? The world is watching.
2020-02-26 4:33,"America has been fooled all along into believing that universal health care is communism, yet every civilized nation has it except us. Because people don’t hesitate to go to a hospital when they feel ill, those countries have a better chance of containing an epidemic.  We will pay a high price for our irrational stubbornness when the coronavirus gains a firm foothold here.  Sick folk without health insurance will wait too long to go to a hospital, in the meanwhile infecting many of those crossing their path irrespective of age, race, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, religious belief or disbelief, wealth, occupation, and political leaning -- all of us.  Lack of universal health care is the most pressing national security threat that we face."
2020-02-26 4:34,Only a matter of time before Trump declares that he likes people who don’t succumb to pandemics.
2020-02-26 5:08,"Mr. Trump is the president and a politician, he is not a medical
advisor nor can he be blamed if the USA medical community is not prepared for the coronavirus."
2020-02-26 5:12,Meanwhile people refuse the flu vaccine. The flu has been killing thousands weekly all year.

2020-02-26 4:47,"Is anyone considering the possibility that Trump “welcomes” this as it could very possibly increase his powers to quarantine and prevent primaries from occurring?  And as the virus spreads throughout the country, this could extend beyond 2020.

We must demand more of our government NOW!"

I'm in my 60's and semi retired. I've had pneumonia twice. I've been living with a couple of auto-immune diseases for 30 years. My doctor tells me to not get pneumonia a third time, so I cross my fingers and sign up for the flu shot every winter. 

My wife works fulltime as a manager in a call center staffed mostly by young folks. Many of her team members have kids. Children are disease vectors. Her parttime job is Uber. She does a lot of airport runs. Her passengers travel EVERYWHERE.

Our next door neighbors are first generation Chinese Americans. They spent a month over there visiting their extended family after Xmas.

Now the CDC says get ready for the pandemic's USA tour. But tRump and his minions have been busily gutting the agency for two years. Meanwhile, this kakkistocracy malAdministration's talking heads and their propaganda network lackeys lie to us, and say ""Don't worry about the Covfefe virus, it's just a cold!""

Trump has proposed a 16% cut to the CDC.

Trump lied, and said they were very close to developing a vaccine for COVID - this is not true, and is irresponsible to suggest 

Trump lied again, and said the COVID was “miraculously” going away, despite the CDC saying the virus is going to spread in the USA. Once again, an irresponsible and possible harmful lie.

Trump has not appointed competent people to deal with these serious issues, and people have little confidence in this administration to deal with major issues like this"
2020-02-26 5:32,"Unless the impending recession messes up Trump's famous economic miracle (see stock market today), the coronavirus news cycle is the best thing that's happened to him since the Senate acquitted him.

Sure took my mind off Roger Stone, Harvey Weinstein, the Democratic debate, and all the other daily good news."

And, on another note the government should be doing something to stop the outrageous price gouging on N95 masks.  $120.00 to ship a package of 10 masks?  Unethical business practices that reflect the greed of some people as they profit from life and death matters."
2020-02-26 5:22,Felt completely confident with Ebola and Obama at the helm.  And that was super deadly. Sure don’t feel secure with Trump at the wheel for a flu like contagion.  So ironic that it is germ based from China.  Two of Trump’s nemesis’s.

No.. I do not think the US is ready.  We had better at least follow the CDC preparations to be as safe as possible.

If it is true that Trump did not want the 14 infected US citizens allowed entry to the US from overseas, we are in for a rough time.

I would bet that necessary agencies have been purged of qualified experts and professionals and replaced with unqualified loyalists.. and people who know people,who know people.. No qualifications.

Flawed testing kits?

2020-02-26 9:06,"We should  all be vigilant and disciplined: wash hands all the time, never touch face when in public spaces, build up immune system (take Vitamin C ).

One creates imperfect copies of itself. Some are more lethal; others less; some more transmissible; others less.  And to them and what they do to your preexisting medical conditions stress.  It complicates treatment.  The victims who die mainly die of those.  

The virus itself may add physical respiratory stress to the overall equation."
2020-02-26 10:15,"While we are rightly advised to prepare, one question I cannot seem to get an answer for is reusing N95 masks.  The ones I have are for one time uses.  It's challenging to get more and frankly the medical profession needs priority.  But I wish I knew if there was any way to clean a ""one time use mask"" since it appears we will not easily be able to obtain more in the near future.  It would be great to see some advice on this."
2020-02-26 10:28,"I taught Social Problems at a community college for many years. We spent much time discussing the nature of various risks, their distribution and the range of possible resposes.
One of the most important topics was the potential for the emergece of moral panics.
Public spaces become not only dangerous those in public spaces are suspects. We do not share, friends will turn on friend, family on family. The illusion of safety is shattered. We blame different groups as causative agents and attack them. There will be shortages of supposed protective measures, specifically facemasks. The hording has begun. The terror is upon us. Our collectivemoral character will be revealed."
2020-02-26 11:25,"The words coming out of the mouths of officials at the federal and state level do not match their actions. It is unbelievable to me that at this point I can ride a NYC subway and am NOT hearing PSAs over the intercom about how to minimize the risk of infection. Years ago, I don’t remember for which health scare, there were PSAs everywhere on how to cough and wash hands to minimize spreading germs. Where are they now? Even something as basic as this would be helpful. 

Additionally, unlike other countries where hospital stays will be largely paid for by public health systems, the average American who contracts the virus will be unable to pay the probable million dollar (or more?) hospital bill. Thoughts and prayers."

2020-02-26 11:38,CDC’s interim guidance on coronavirus testing only recommends testing for known contacts of coronavirus cases and people with a febrile illness who traveled to China (loosely paraphrasing). When is that guidance going to broaden? It’s no wonder the US has logged so few cases — no one is looking for it.
2020-02-26 11:46,I feel safer knowing Trump is galavanting around India holding photo-op rallies on the American dime. Maybe while he's away Congress can listen to scientists instead of putting them to party-loyalty tests and allocate the money required to protect Americans as much as possible from a pandemic. Money will also be needed to work on a vaccine.
2020-02-26 12:18,"Now we will learn how important our federal agencies are and that dismantling them was a terrible idea.  Think of the institutional knowledge lost by the thousands of loyal scientists and experienced employees now gone.  Rebuilding will take decades. This is why I will never vote republican ever- there is no plan, just tax breaks.

Leadership and executive experience are really important - Bloomberg was made for this time."
2020-02-26 9:29,Trump once rang Mike Flynn at 3am to ask if a strong dollar was good or bad for the US economy. Flynn said he didn't know and suggested he ask an economist as he was the National Security Advisor. So Trump may be asking the Department of Housing for advice about Covid-19
2020-02-26 6:52,"Next plan from trump.. A wall to stop the virus..

Our money shouldn't be spent on Space Force when we cannot even be made safe here on earth.

While he is hurting healthcare and trying to destroy ACA, we will find out the hard way just how few resources are available for this impending health disaster.  People will be flooding emergency rooms."
2020-02-26 7:32,The problem I see with this in the States is that everyone runs to the hospital for everything and demands instant treatment. I saw it with the complaining of the cruise ship passengers who then were wrongly flown to the U.S. when they should have stayed put. The slightest wiff of a serious outbreak will bring hysteria thanks to the 24 hour news cycle.
2020-02-26 9:30,"Just a minute. Hold on. Trump said not to worry because the coronavirus epidemic would be over by April 1st. 

Why is everyone panicking?"
2020-02-26 10:01,What worries me more than this virus is Americans ability to panic. I feel like our country is on a hair trigger for this reaction fueled by how our media covers this type of event. Can you picture a cooperative population when asked to stay home?  Add to this mix a type of love affair with apocalyptic views of the world. We are not Chinese.
2020-02-26 10:02,"The Coronavirus should be a wake up call for America.  All those who say, they are healthy so do bother to have Health Insurance!  Also the work ethic in America, makes sick people still come to work.  I remember when I had the flu some years ago.  I was told, ""come in and work, or kiss you job goodbye"" I was working in the service industry.  The result, half of my co-workers, including the boss who ordered me to come to work, got infected.  This happens way too much in the USA.  Here in Europe with Socialized Medicine, people who are sick, have 14 days guaranteed pay, in case of illness.  So people stay home when they are ill.  That simply does not happen in the USA!  If the virus comes, and it will. Things in the USA are going to get very scary.  Americans simply do not believe in self isolation!"

(And, such precautions will also work against the flu.)

As for distributing masks, they should be available free at pharmacies, along with free flu and pneumonia shots.

Socialized medicine you say? Baloney, it's good public health. The reason anyone would be willing to pay for such a program is that such a program helps prevent 'that same anyone' from catching COV/FLU.

2020-02-26 8:05,As usual the anti-science anti intellectual  Trump is just living in his own bubble. It is just appalling that whatever he says on any topic is not based on any deep thinking and reflection of sometimes very complicated issues. You just know that it would be impossible for senior health officials to do an in depth analysis of this issue with Trump. The US better hope that it is not hit by a pandemic because your leader would be incapable of leading at that time. Rallies  with his sycophantic followers is not leading.  MGA will not cut it in the real world. In a previous life he would have made a great captain of the Titanic. Best of luck America...I think that you will need it.

It doesn't care about borders, political affiliations, what you ate last night, how moral you are, or not. Once the health care professionals get sick and die from this (they are first in line, along with their families) and resources for care are no longer available everyone is on a level playing field. No amount of money will save your life or the life of those you love or think more worthy. So what do you do? You have some spare water and food, you wash your hands, you avoid people who are sick and don't go out when you are sick. You appreciate today, because novel virus or not, that is all that is guaranteed anyway. If you want to know what this can do, go to a cemetery, go to the area of all that are buried in 1917 - 1920 - the spanish flu, which killed more people than WW1. Entire families gone, survival based on luck. And then live. Control is an illusion. It always has been."
2020-02-26 13:04,"I’m home sick today, with a fever and a cough and cold symptoms. Is it Covid-19? Probably not. But there’s no way to tell, is there? My state has no way to test for coronavirus, and the CDC is only testing people with a travel history to China or contact with a confirmed infected person. If community transmission has begun in the U.S., how will we know? Even people hospitalized with acute respiratory distress can’t be tested in most areas unless they meet the CDC’s overly narrow criteria. And yet public officials and the media are blithely assuring the public that there’s no community transmission here and no deaths caused by coronavirus. Interesting to note that one of the Italian patients was hospitalized for 10 days before he was tested, and shortly afterward testing in the community showed an outbreak. We need to expand the criteria for testing in the U.S. so we understand the scope of the problem we’re facing."

 My grandfather told me a story about the Spanish flu that decimated many communities when he was young. He said neighbors left food on the doorstep of families that had the flu. If you have the room and the finances, prepare for this as if for any long lasting emergency like an earthquake. Buy non-perishable food and other staples to last a month so you don't have to go out. Pretend you live in the Alaskan bush with no grocery stores."
2020-02-26 13:29,"While the threat of infection is serious, it does not appear as likely as getting caught in some kind of preventative measure. For example, as hysteria sets in, it would seem possible that inbound flights could be prevented from landing regardless of the uninfected American citizens on board. Moreover, being locked down in a foreign hotel is seemingly becoming more likely by the day.  Logic would suggest that this kind of reasoning will have a dramatically chilling affect of economic activity as future travelers ask themselves, why take the risk?"
2020-02-26 13:31,"Consider this: In New Zealand, Australia and countless other countries people will go to a hospital if they have symptoms - why wouldn't you when the cost is a few hundreds dollars - at best.

Here in the USA, even with health insurance if you go to an Emergency Ward and they decide you don't deserve to be admitted, you are up for sometimes thousands of dollars for the service - and if you are admitted it can be more money than one can imagine.  2-4 weeks in hospital, even with insurance, well, you might as well sell your house and cash in your IRA. i have insurance and am still paying off copious amounts of money for a bad year I had.

So I imagine many will not go and get checked because the cost is too high. So I expect the virus to spread because it will be too costly to suffer the consequence of a positive result. If you are a middle class person, the cost of a positive result will be 2-4 weeks quarantine, soaring insurance costs and a maximum deduction, and in all probability a positive result for one of your family members means at least another, so we are talking the maximum deduction for a family.

We may have ""the best"" health system, which is to say NY has ""the best"" residences - if you can afford it. One might say South Africans have access to the most diamonds also...

But rest assured, if I made less and didn't try, it would be all free and I'd get other things checked out more often."

Based on the experience with the patients brought into the US from China and the cruise ships, well nourished people with good medical care appear to be getting through this without serious sequela.

Actually having confirmed cases to observe in the setting of high-quality medical surveillance and care in an open country that shares medical outcome data should help clarify the actual morbidity / mortality risk once infected with this novel virus.

Marginally nourished tightly packed people in developing countries with limited advanced medical care may have a completely different experience.  Some of the early chest CT data from China does show a viral pneumonia type pattern in some patients. Prompt diagnosis and respiratory support where needed should prevent unnecessary death.

To avoid unnecessary panic and for perspective, there is significant risk from the yearly flu outbreaks.   The same rules apply.  Try to practice scrupulous personal hygiene and be mindful, not fearful of your surroundings.

I just watched an expert in the U.S. health care system late last night speaking on just how pathetically unprepared your nation is. Not because there is not a plan. Experts have predicted this kind of outbreak for some time now. No; it is because Trump in another mindless act of stupidity has cut funding for just such an occasion because of sheer utter blind ignorance...AGAIN. So when this virus does start infecting Americans soon; one wonders if his base will even have the temerity to ask how come it did not disappear by April; when Trump promised it would.Of course by then his genius staff will be somehow blaming the Democrats.

As of today the state of Hawaii still has not submitted any samples, while 43 other states and territories have sent in a total 479 for testing. The CDC says 14 tested positive, 412 tested negative, and 53 are still pending results.

We asked the state how it handled the samples provided with the 8 PUI forms. The DOH spokesperson told us: “The forms were sent to our state lab with specimens and the specimens were not tested because the samples did not meet the criteria. The samples were discarded.”

Congratulations Hawaii.  You currently have no confirmed of cases COVID-19 because you haven't tested for any cases. Brilliant!  You must be following the CDC guidelines which as stated in the previous post are the following:

Currently, health officials recommend testing only for people who have respiratory symptoms and have recently traveled to China, or those who have been in close contact with someone who was infected.  

I guess those 8 people didn't travel from China.  S. Korea perhaps, but not China. 

I feel much better now don't you?  Imagine  Apple coming to you touting their new cool new iPhone...4?  That is the CDC right now. They expect us to use an iPhone 4 during an iPhone 11 Pro crisis.

There are about 300,000,000 Americans.  Two percent of that number is 6,000,000, or six million people in the US who could die from the corona virus.  That's three times the total population of the state in which I live.

Can someone please find a problem with my calculations, as they are scaring the bejeezus out of me?    A CDC website states the annual mortality rate of seasonal flu since 2010 has fluctuated from 12,000 to 61,000.  So the novel corona virus is a much more frightening monster."

2020-02-25 13:14,"This is yet another reminder of how incompetent the Trump Administration is, which waited over a month to respond to this pandemic. It is also indicative of the need for global cooperation, not isolationism. Pathogens waft through the air and will find their way to our shores."
2020-02-25 13:41,I hope that each state is making its own arrangements for appropriate quarantine facilities. It certainly seems that there are no clear plans at the federal level.  Why on earth did the administration wait so long to request funds to support the response?  This request should have been made over a month ago.  And why are they low-balling the number?  What a shame this administration chose to dismantle the groups that had been tasked with dealing with situations like this.  Mr. Azar does not appear up to the job of leading this effort.

Everyone arriving at a US airport or port from overseas should be tested, but we don’t even have the basics in place. The reason that the numbers in Italy and South Korea are so high is because they are rapidly testing people. South Korea is running over 6000 tests a day."

Better we should take intelligent precautions than dwell on the omnipresent headlines meant to terrify us and get us to click or purchase media.  Does infection of a high Iranian official warrant a big headline, suggesting that this is even worse because he has it?

I am old enough to have known borders with custom officers, they just implied waiting longer at the border. Since the ligne Maginot did not stop the Germans from invading France, I don't really see how Europeans are supposed to stop the virus? Build Berlin walls and shoot at trespassers? Because communist countries did not catch the flu? Closing borders between European countries would be like closing borders between American states. Good luck with that.

2020-02-25 14:32,"It has been reported that symptoms also include diarrhea, and that the virus is thus spread also by intestinal gases/aerated fecal matter, which can reach 100m, or more. This was the case with SARS, and would explain why a 62-year-old woman living 10 floors below the apartment of a COVID-19-virus-infected person became infected, apparently from “unsealed” sewage pipes. 

This means simply that, if you can smell it, you just have been infected. 

Entire families living together could get infected immediately by such airborne droplets, or pilgrims using a public bathroom in Qom.

2020-02-25 14:38,Price gouging in China!!!  That sounds downright capitalistic to me.
2020-02-25 14:45,"Our healthcare system is not equipped to handle this outbreak. Consider the Miami man who returned from China a few weeks ago, ill with flu symptoms, goes to his local ER out of caution for testing. He is triaged, swabbed in a special contagion room and dx with flu. Lucky him. No covid19. He receives a $3000 bill! Given this virus will show mildly for many, who will get tested if a $3000 bill is waiting? People who may have it will avoid testing and go on to spread this illness rapidly.

This private care model cannot accomodate dealing with this outbreak. If cautious prudent measure costs thousands of dollars just to rule out coronavirus, we will never be able to contain this here. These tests need to be low cost or free, right NOW. There is no market solution to the requirements of epidemic response. 

Mass, free testing needs to be up and running right away, but our public health infrastructure has been gutted by Trump. So we wait for these measures to be re-established and re-built. There is still no nationwide testing capability. Trump and the GOP are responsible for the difficulty our public health system is having in responding to the outbreak. 

Nations like South Korea, Singapore, Italy are running thousands of tests, identifying where this virus has a foothold and responding. I have low confidence in our own numbers on coronovirus because we simply are not getting the testing done. Hands down, if we had widescale testing happening, we would be finding it. What then?"
2020-02-25 15:03,"It should be clear by now that the ""skyrocketing"" number of cases in Italy and Iran are more indicative that the the virus has been circulating (and not just in those countries), rather than that there is a sudden spike in numbers.  You have to test for the virus in order to find it.  Most countries are only testing those who are coming in from outside.  If the virus entered those countries (and others) in early January, and people are getting mild symptoms believing they have just a cold, but are spreading it just the same as a cold, I  think we will shortly see a large uptick in all areas as the 15% who experience serious illness, clog hospitals (which is how Iran and Italy found they had a problem).  I pray for the health care workers in these hospitals and hope precautions are being taken.  They are on the front lines."
2020-02-25 15:17,"I am not the only one here who hopes that China will finally ban the trade in exotic and endangered/threatened species, either for vanity collectors or dubious claims of medicinal value. These practices definitely aid in the process of novel virus development as exotic species intermingle with domestic animals in the markets and farms, and even in the gut of those who consume them or come in contact with them.  It is not racist to state this, in fact scientists have been warning about it for years."
2020-02-25 15:18,"It's extraordinary to me that markets have not reacted more adversely. This doesn't look remotely as if it's going away, and asymptomatic (or low-symptom) transmission means that it's almost certainly live in terms of community transmission in the United States, not to mention in other countries with higher population density and worse public health infrastructure. This will get much worse, and even if loss of human life remains relatively low, it does appear that we're going to see a ""black swan"" moment for the global economy."
2020-02-25 15:19,"Is it time that we return to a more provincial society? The climate crisis would dictate so— now, the sphere of global health seems to make its case.

1.  Why is the deputy health minister of a country holding a press conference when he is ill with the virus?

And

2.  What about the contacts of the Italian physician ill with the virus before he got to the hotel?

The public health response is bungled."
2020-02-25 15:29,"It would appear that coronavirus clusters around the world are being under-reported.  There are about 200,000 Chinese nationals working in Africa on infrastructure, etc., yet no cases reported.  Doesn't seem possible, unless the Chinese govt. is not testing its people abroad.  Same for Sri Lanka and Burma;  many thousands of Chinese workers, but no cases of coronavirus.

In writing this, I am not trying to say there's anything wrong with having Chinese workers around the world if the receiving nations want them.   But I think we need to know if the workers are being tested for the virus and if nations with limited health infrastructures are experiencing the same outbreaks as in Italy, Iran, S. Korea, etc -- but without any reporting.  If so, then it does seem we have a pandemic...

Can the WHO go into some of these nations and begin testing before the numbers explode?"
2020-02-25 14:48,"Oh my.  It seems like only yesterday the Times was tut-tutting China for lack of transparency about the virus, putting politics in command rather than public health policy.  And now we have America's Mr. Transparency, Donald Trump, telling his administration to keep its mouth shut about coronavirus so as not to hurt stock prices and/or his reelection prospects.

If we were to look at this in the way the Times reports on China, we would be wondering what fundamental flaw there is  at the root of America's political and economic system that repeatedly produces public policy abortions such as the one Trump is now enforcing regarding coronavirus epidemiology. And we must then ask whether this most recent manifestation will ""discredit the regime"" enough that it's continuance may be in danger. 

The American people may finally rise up.  We ourselves may ask these questions about the system that produced a Trump presidency.  But a courtier publication will never do that."
2020-02-25 15:26,"Many compare our current situation to the response to Katrina but it is a false comparison. Unlike Katrina, our leadership cannot simply sit back and watch a disaster unfold from a safe distance. It should be emphasized to lawmakers that they cannot escape this virus as they rely on and are exposed to the little people who will contract this virus and are therefore as much in the path of the floodwaters of disease as we all are. Since the disease spreads during the asymptomatic phase both before and after recovery and very soon in all ethnic groups - no one will know who has the virus. The fact that most lawmakers are in the age group bearing the greatest burden of COVID 19 and will be just as likely to be victims of this virus as the little people should be emphasized - repeatedly - and preferably by Fox and Friends. The 1% should also be worried as well unless they are cooking and cleaning for themselves inside their bunkers in New Zealand. Putting economic interests above human life, even if the lives are the pions of the world, will endanger the 1% as well. The phrase ""You can't take it with you"" should be emphasized - repeatedly - and preferably by the Wall Street Journal. For those in charge, reading Poe's The Mask of Red Death should be required reading."

While I’m leaving tonight for Paris I am very anxious about getting on a flying Petrie dish.  I am not a germaphobic but this is frightening. While Paris may be safer it may not be for long. Who knows and who knows where really is safe except maybe the Southern Hemisphere. 
I would hope that the WHO and the industrialized nation recognize the dangers here and put a concerted effort into irradiating these winter viruses from the planet.  Whatever it takes, be it humanitarianism or greed, whatever, just get it done before the next one comes along that will be stronger, more contagious and deadlier than the last."

If we had kept the nuclear deal in place and were pursuing better diplomatic relations with them, the virus outbreak there would give us a diplomatic opportunities to try to bring their behavior more in line.

Meanwhile, what is the risk of Tenerife's Costa Adeje Palace becoming an island based Diamond Princess? A thousand guests and no clear quarantine protocol in place? 

We don't have a good grasp on the incubation period. The Washington Post ran this lede there days ago: ""There are some indications that the incubation period for the coronavirus could be longer than 14 days, with patients testing positive after much longer quarantine periods, researchers said.""

Still. with seven borders, rising to 15 when nearby states along the Persian Gulf and the Caspian Sea are included, this might be understandable. For the very reason that Iran became the pivitol country on the ancient and resurrected Silk Road, geography sometimes has its drawbacks. Yet,  the possibility that neighboring countries might have downplayed their own numbers or had been less than forthcoming regarding the source of the virus is ignored.

Last, the illegal U.S. sanctions that in effect ban export of medical equipment to Iran gets no mention at all."

With so many uninsured in this country and testing for covid-19 needed, several major cities already selected to test patients for it, how many will never be tested or treated for the virus due to lack of health insurance? Will  the uninsured fear seeking testing/treatment due to costs likely in thousands of dollars?

Trumps $2.5B funding request is inadequate given the high numbers of uninsured or inadequately insured in this country.  It encourages the spread Covid-19."

Investors are advised to invest for the long term and re-balance according to their own prospective personal life circumstances.  

On another topic, a week or so ago, North Korea was given financial aid by the US for this epidemic, so some very capable officials in that so-called swamp are obviously on top of the game."

2020-02-25 16:48,"As of now, the U.S. has very limited capacity to test for this virus.  I don't understand why this issue isn't getting much more widespread coverage in the media. I watched an interview with a doctor at one of New York City's premier hospitals this morning and he was raising the alarm about their inability to test patients for this new coronavirus because the CDC test kits were faulty.  State labs cannot develop their own test kits without going through a lengthy FDA approval process.  This situation is completely unacceptable.  We likely have cases in this country that are going undetected because we can't test for them."
2020-02-25 16:53,"Nobody talks about smoking. For influenza, smokers have a 5 times greater risk of catching the disease according to the CDC. There are also different reports about increased mortality rates from pneumonia for smokers ranging from 30% increased risk to 50x increased risk depending on the underlying cause.  We should expect Corona to rapidly spread in countries like China, Italy and the middle east with heavy smoking rates and result in higher death rates, while these numbers may not carry over to countries with lower smoking rates. Smoking can also explain why more men than women are dying from Corona virus in China - around half of Chinese men smoke while smoking rate among Chinese women is only a few percent.  Of course both genders get exposed to the second hand smoke and pollution. Imagine if Corona virus could cast a spotlight on the dangers of smoking and pollution and we could work on reducing them across the globe."

2020-02-25 17:17,"Trump says everything is fine and this will all work out.

Meanwhile, I saw 3 physicians on tv this weekend, including Anthony Fauci and an infectious disease expert from Columbia Presbyterian, criticizing our government's response thus far as very poor, indicating a lack of planning and a lack of understanding by the administration that the primary goal right now should be ensuring U.S. hospitals and physicians  have protocol and equipment to diagnosis the virus - the first step in being able to tell how fast its spreading.  Without knowing where and how the virus is spreading, it can't be contained.

One of these experts said the fact that there are so few reported cases in the U.S. isn't good news because the virus is spreading so quickly around the world that few reports of U.S. cases indicates that cases here aren't being diagnosed and reported.

Couple this with Trump's cuts to NIH, the CDC and other disease research and management organizations and his comments that everything is just fine are

Scary."

As noted in an excellent article in yesterday’s Times “Is the Coronavirus Outbreak a Pandemic?”, trying to stop the spread is “like trying to stop the wind.” As people are contagious before becoming symptomatic, it’s highly likely that one day soon we will wake up to reports of cases in NYC or LA or wherever originating perhaps from persons who traveled from China weeks ago or Italy or Iran more recently. I don’t know if banning international air travel weeks ago would have helped but as noted in the above referenced article quarantines might delay but will not stop the pandemic.

2020-02-25 17:10,"An excellent ""get ahead"" for next time would be to provide WHO with funds and support to look around the world at all the insane ways the conspicuously consumptive rich of the world use food as a weapon of status.  

Then, premptively identify and hold as many viruses native to these animals as possible so viral ID and vaccine roll out  can be quicker next time.  

Yes, there will be a next time.   There are calls to control the trafficking of the animals.  Hmmm:

I am confident WHO is sane, public-spirited and rational. 

I am also confident that people who eat or otherwise use, for example, pangolins are selfish and irrational and cannot be controlled.

2020-02-25 17:17,"So far America has been quite lucky not to have a widespread crisis with Donald Trump as president. The man couldn't even decide what to do about the White House flag when John McCain died. 

I fear a global pandemic will illustrate just how unfit and untruthful this president is."
2020-02-25 17:39,"Remember, truth isn't truth according to Gullianni. Listen only to the alternative facts from Trump's Twitter account and you'll be fine."
2020-02-25 17:06,"What is really alarming is that in times of crisis, we need to be able to trust what our President says. We need to believe that he is telling us the truth.  We need to feel confident that leadership at the White House is rock solid.

The reality is we have none of that.  We have a President (Trump) who tells a thousand lies a day.  We have a President that no one can trust.  We have a man child in the Oval Office that will say or do whatever comes to his ""brilliant, little mind"".  What we don't have is qualified leadership in times of a crisis, which the coronavirus is a world wide crisis.

You can't trust China and you can't trust Trump."

2020-02-25 17:06,"According to this, the US needs $3 billion to ""fund public and private research on vaccines and antidotes, stockpiling medical supplies, manufacturing medicines to overcome shortages caused by China’s supply disruption, getting accurate diagnostic kits to hospitals and doctors, and more planning and guidance for worst-case scenarios.""

Part of that is needed to replenish funds taken from elsewhere to fight coronavirus. Will Republican Senate and President Trump adequately fund America's defense of coronavirus?

The USA better up its game on this— otherwise, it’s coming."
2020-02-25 17:22,"Well people have done a great job of panicking over the Corona Virus, which is like having a heart attack over a pimple.  If people thought about it rather than being mindlessly riled up by the sensationalistic media they would realize what a minor problem this is.  Millions of people worldwide contract a version of the flu each year and tens of thousands die from it.  Do factories or businesses shut down? No! Do schools close? No! Are millions of people quarantined? Absolutely not.  Do stock markets throughout the world take huge nosedives- no, not at all.

Now we have a relatively minor virus which has affected less than 100,000 people officially and maybe double or triple that amount actually and killed a few thousand people and society worldwide has a panic attack.  In 2018 over 36,500 people died in the U.S. in car accidents.  Have we banned the automobile? Has the stock market collapsed because of this? 

So why is the world and the stock markets having a fit over a relatively minor disease?  Unfortunately it is because people are enthralled by the unusual and unexpected (especially if it is affecting somebody else).  This fascination is catered to by the news media, which frankly could sensationalize a hangnail on some social media trendsetters pinky. People should realize that to the news media the “News” is a product used to sell advertising, nothing more. Rational discourse is okay if it doesn’t interfere with sensationalism."

2020-02-25 17:31,This will hit the US. Trump has defunded the CDC so the impact will likely be great. Trump and FOX will blame the Dems and his lemmings will believe them.

2020-02-25 17:12,"At this point, the coronavirus is almost surely widely spread in Iran, based on the outbound traffic and cases exported. South Korea has 800+ cases. Italy has 200+. There is no information on South America or Africa, which I suspect is due to absent of information not absent of infected cases.

It is already a pandemic of global scale."
2020-02-25 16:55,"A young American student, ""trapped"" in her University dormitory in Wuhan, says that they aren't doing any virus testing anymore. She hasn't left her dorm in 3 weeks. At least she still has internet! We're both members of an expat Facebook group."
2020-02-25 16:59,"Why should we trust any numbers reported by the Chinese?

They have continuously lied about the whole situation and have always manipulated their data about a whole range of subjects."
2020-02-25 17:23,"A guest at a holiday resort in Spain tested positive for coronavirus and it's on lockdown with all other guests being monitored and tested. A sick guest in a Hawaii resort tests positive the day he arrives home and the CDC's response is 'Wash your hands, nothing to worry about, folks!'

Hawaii doesn't even have the ability to test for the virus, nor do most states. Select samples that meet a strict criteria based on personal travel history are shipped to Atlanta, GA, and, maybe, in a week or so, the CDC will communicate the results with local health officials. Current CDC protocol dictates cross-continental shipping of virus samples, which, in my opinion, could degrade the RNA sequence of the virus the QRT-PCR test amplifies. This could result in false negatives of the few cases that are even being screened. Plus, data out of China suggests that tests should be carried out more than once, as, if the person isn't shedding a significant amount of virus, an initial test can be a false negative (as was the case with Dr. Li Wenliang). This doesn't seem possible with the CDC's monitoring system. 

America has the labs, the equipment, and the talent, to test, diagnose, and treat this disease as well as anywhere in the world. Our failure to do so is a massive failure of politics, economics, and bureaucracy. We need to stop blaming China and get our own house in order before COVID-19 wreaks the lethal havoc it has the potential to. Hopefully, it isn't too late."
2020-02-25 17:31,"So, let’s wait with judgement until we know how dangerous this disease is. Data from the Princess cruise ship suggests that relatively many were infected, but very few of them died. And that is in a population of very high risk; in confined space and of high age."
2020-02-25 17:36,"Well Iran's president has it slightly wrong, it's not Iran's enemies that are sowing panic, it's simply the media.  Although I suppose a free press is technically the enemy of Iran, so he's somewhat correct.

Every day there has been more hype about this, and I do wonder if it's the usual media motive of attracting more clicks and selling more newspapers, or if there's some larger goal.  But the coronavirus, as always, is simply not very important.

The total death toll, of about 2,700, when divided by the world population, equals roughly zero.  Also when divided by the number of people killed by the flu last year, about 646,000, it also equals roughly zero.  The pollution in the air in China's cities is on track to kill hundreds of times more than the coronavirus.

And, the coronavirus only affects humans, and humans are responsible for all of the destruction to the environment, and all the million species that are slated to go extinct.

I know the panic will keep spreading, and I'll keep seeing fools wearing masks in the subways despite the fact that nobody is walking around with this illness in NYC.  But really, this ""plague"" is a plague of hysterical panic, nothing at all like the pandemics of bubonic plague which really did a lot of damage centuries ago."
2020-02-25 17:31,"Why are we still playing under the pretense that the Chinese havent been lying about their number? We have known for weeks and numbers from SK (who is handling this effectively) confirms this. 

We should all demand that the talking heads from WHO who are bowing down to CCP demands be sacked."
2020-02-25 17:12,"Once the COVID-19 hits home we get to see how great Trump and Team made America Great. So far we do not have enough masks and protective clothing for medical personal.

2020-02-25 17:29,"Sooner or later, one of the tens of thousands of Chinese or Korean contract workers in Africa is going to transmit CoVid19, in nations with almost no public health assets.  That will make Ebola control seem like a stroll in the park."
2020-02-25 17:56,"No one should underestimate the gravity of this situation and the historic proportions it could assume.  We should have a full, candid and complete briefing from our government before the end of the week, but I doubt that will happen.  We have the wrong man in office to guide us through what will likely be an extremely difficult and long period of turmoil for this country."
2020-02-25 18:02,"There's nothing said anywhere about the fact that viruses are adapting faster than humans capacity to respond. And that the supposed ""slow"" response is because of how in a rapidly changing world, viruses adapt rapidly as well. One has to look outside the western medical model for assistance. If modern medicine knew how to stop this pandemic, it would have done so."
2020-02-25 18:00,"I'd like to know how the hospitality and travel industry are dealing with this - right down to homeshare, airbnb. As a small time ""host"" I am wary of (and really not) accepting any out of country reservations. That was until this week ""particularly Asia"", now ""anywhere"" really. The impact even on my small income will be disastrous, but not ""at the moment"" (until more known) not prepared to take a risk - for me, my neighbours, or the community."
2020-02-25 18:01,"We are being told to brace for the likely outbreak. But how are we supposed to prepare? Stockpile food so we can minimize trips to the grocery store? Stockpile face masks and goggles? Wash our hands until they're chapped and raw? 

What, exactly, should we be doing? Prayers and hand sanitizer? A little advice here, please..."
2020-02-25 18:06,How exactly should we brace? By selling off assets to prepare for the massive deductible/coinsurance payments we'll have to make soon?
2020-02-25 18:07,"And what is going to happen in a country like this with millions of people who don't have health insurance? I expect they either won't go to the doctor, thereby putting others at risk, or will be charged thousands and thousands for seeking treatment in an emergency room."
2020-02-25 18:07,"It's sad that a wake-up call for our government should come in the form of a global pandemic, but it puts into sharp relief how much we depend on our neighbors, allies and even enemies for our health and wellbeing.  

The downturn in the market is also a wake-up call.  We just can't go it alone."

2020-02-25 18:07,"The CDC website has information on prevention and awareness, but not very much about surviving the virus. Are survivors immune? How long does recovery take? How do you know when the virus has passed? It would be great to hear from survivors how they endured it and what recovery is like."
2020-02-25 18:08,"Note to POTUS: I don't think this virus thing is simply ""gonna work out."" The latest CDC warnings are downright scary: to ""brace for the spread,"" be ready for ""significant disruptions,"" and acknowledge that ""this might be bad.""

The CDC, made up of medical experts, epidemiologists, and infectious disease specialists, has clearly formulated mathematical models to project what is now a real threat of an exponential transmission. I hope our germophobic president will not only listen, but be proactive. Do the mathematical models suggest timelines? Can the U.S. glean any best practices from those countries already impacted? And, most importantly, what actual steps can Americans take to prepare for and maybe even prevent the inevitable?"
2020-02-25 17:47,Why was the briefing on the US preparations for a coronavirus confidential? Since when was public health confidential???
2020-02-25 18:08,"So now I am warned. But what I am supposed to DO? Besides washing hands, I see no suggestion on what an appropriate reaction to this outbreak is. 

If only we had a government run by people who believe in government..."
2020-02-25 18:12,"Don’t worry. The data-driven Trump administration surely has a well thought out plan to address the spreading virus.  And with all of our strong international relationships, I’m sure we can lead an international response that will both protect us and help prevent a humanitarian catastrophe from hurting those in less well off regions of the world. 

Americans chose Donald Trump because he is the perfect person to address a complex, multifaceted threat like this one, right?

I’m sure we’ll hear a plan any day now. Right after we see those tax returns we were promised."
2020-02-25 18:12,"The continue lack of testing capacity here in the US should be priority number one. We have no way of knowing if it's circulating widely right now because we're only doing ~10 tests/day in the whole country! Somehow dozens of countries are now able to do between a 100-10,000 tests/day. The FDA and CDC need to get a grip and permit lab-scale testing ASAP using existing kits from abroad. Community spread is already here, we're just not testing for it."
2020-02-25 18:11,"I would appreciate some kind of clear advice about whether it's appropriate to order N95 masks at this point, and if so, which kinds/brands are most suitable. NYTimes, could you do some digging on this important point and let us know? The CDC is saying, ""Get ready!"" but isn't really telling us much more about what to do. (Get a flu shot, wash hands...)  Thanks."

2020-02-25 17:53,"Such a helpful article. Nowhere does it say HOW the public should prepare. Where is the actual guidance? This information is sorely lacking in general; it should be at the beginning of any COVID-19 related article or writi big any kind. 

Also, why on earth was there a Classified briefing to the Senate on this very subject? All the information out there should be made public and widely disseminated. 

Ignorance and secrecy will only stoke fear, and lack of information will directly co tribute to the spread of infection. Shame again on our government."

2020-02-25 17:54,"What I find disturbing with all of the media hype is that the lack of focus on recoveries.
Johns Hopkins has a great summary of the progression of the disease, country by country, indicating the number of initial cases, the number of deaths, the number of recoveries and the number of existing cases.
If one clicks on the UK, for example, the site reports 13 confirmed cases, 8 recoveries and 5 existing cases.  For Italy (my home), there are 283 cases, 7 deaths, 1 recovery and 275 existing cases (the deaths, BTW, are all people who are elderly and had pre-existing serious conditions and they may have died as a result of the virus complicating those conditions).
Altogether, as of this moment, the JH site is reporting 80,350 confirmed cases, 2,705 deaths and 27,878 recoveries.  That's a 34.5% recovery rate, so far.  That rate, I believe, can be expected to improve.

2020-02-25 18:14,"We are effectively in the pandemic that was feared. It was inevitable because of two factors, air travel which involves about a billion passengers yearly in and out of the US  alone and people who are not as yet showing symptoms to COVID-19 but are infected. That's a cocktail for a pandemic if there ever was one.

Epidemiologists are saying that over the coming year 40 to 70% of the world will come into contact with the virus that causes COVID-19. Eventually, a vaccine will be developed but until then, probably sometime next year, it will be the daily reality in our lives and likely change our habits producing consequences that are not at all clear, but definitely not good."
2020-02-25 18:11,"Everyday my commuter rail and subway are filled with coughing, hacking, people without a care of how they will infect others. And it seems that they strive to sit right next to me. 

It has been revealed that microorganisms exhibit a degree of control over their hosts.  I have wondered if those hosting disease microorganism are compelled to seek non-diseased hosts in order to propagate itself. After all if it doesn't find new victims it dies out.  

Imagine if all the sick people just stayed home and didn't infect others."

2020-02-25 17:48,"How do you expect health authorities anywhere to declare a pandemic and introduce severe restrictions, closures, et al BEFORE they even  know what they're dealing with? This is highly irresponsible, attention-grabbing reporting, that only adds to the already spreading fear."

By making a run on local pharmacies for hand sanitizer and face masks? Downloading the latest binge-worthy TV series before Netflix and Hulu staffers are all calling in sick? I'm tired of government officials telling us to ready ourselves for the next big disaster without actually offering practical suggestions for action."
2020-02-25 17:50,"So infectious disease experts would like us to “prepare.” How exactly? I’ve read up on masks; they actually say to avoid those. What else should we do, specifically?"
2020-02-25 17:57,"I was reading an article on why more men than women die from the coronavirus. I learned a couple of things. China has the highest percentage of smokers in the world. 80% of the men smoke while only 12% of the women smoke AND smokers are more likely to die of the coronavirus. If you smoke, it's a good time to quit.
The other thing was that women were more likely to see a doctor when they thought they had the virus and men were more likely to put off medical care. If you can afford medical care, see a doctor if your are sick.
I worry about the many Americans who have no health insurance, who have jobs that won't them off of work if they're sick, or who have such high deductibles that they don't see doctors even if they have insurance. How many Americans won't get medical help because they can't afford it or their jobs (usually low paying jobs) won't let them off or won't pay them for sick leave?"

Practical information would be helpful and decrease anxiety.  Thank you."
2020-02-25 18:21,"I think an orderly response is the most prudent. It is good to think in terms of emergency preparedness. Beyond washing hands frequently and well (find out what well means), avoiding touching our faces, anyone who need meds should consider stocking up some. Get a bit more non perishable food into the pantry. Figure out childcare if someone in the family gets sick. For the longer term, I am taking greater care of my edible garden. This episode is a lesson on dependency and resilience."
2020-02-25 18:21,"I was all over Spain surrounded by numerous travelling Chinese celebrating their New Year’s abroad. I changed cities every four days beginning in Barcelona, then Sevilla, Cordoba, Granada, then plane to Madrid to catch flight to Marrakesh where I spent seven days celebrating my birthday. On the last day, January 28th, I began to have symptoms. Horrid headache, body aches, head congestion and an odd throat pain accompanied by coughs and gasping for air. Flew to Lisbon the 29th where I worsened and lay on a hotel bed for four nights in sweats. Switched to another hotel for final evening. Then flew to Madrid February 3rd to catch flight to JFK the 4th  

I was seriously ill but wore a mask and upgraded to Business Class as I would have never survived had I not lain flat. Once in NYC I promptly went to Penn Station to catch a train to DC. Was bedridden with badly worsening symptoms that led me to the VA medical center in DC twice. Warned them about my travels - was given an X Ray and sent home to rest and fluids. Seven days later after no improvement I returned once more advising of my travels. They called CDC and it was again dismissed but I was given powerful antibiotics. Am now better, but waiting to see if their assumed diagnosis of Whooping Cough was accurate or if I was just one of the lucky who survived the virus after FOUR weeks of delirious illness gasping for air. 

I’ll know later today if it was indeed Whooping Cough. If not then I was misdiagnosed."
2020-02-25 18:22,"Dramatic action is needed now to slow down the spread of Corona virus since the virus spreads well before symptoms appear.  Spring training and all indoor sports events need to be canceled, religious services need to be curtailed and trade shows and amusement parks are also at high risk for spreading corona virus.  The next stage is to close schools."
2020-02-25 18:25,"I was in HK when the outbreak started in late January and everyone had been doing a lot of precautions like washing hands for at least 20s regularly, wearing face masks (3-ply and up to spec), covering toilets when flushing, not going to crowded places, etc. When I returned the US, everyone was still joking it is not as dangerous as flu, and saying people in Asia overreacted.
I would appreciate if the government had reacted to it earlier and shared more information on how to prevent or what to do when people have symptoms."
2020-02-25 18:26,"So the message is:
“We are asking the American public to prepare for the expectation that this might be bad,” Dr. Messonnier said.

2020-02-25 18:29,"The U.S. strategy seems to be one of ""luck"" or mayhaps ""thoughts and prayers."" 

How many Americans can't afford to go to the doctor? Can't afford a hospital stay? Can't afford to take time off work for illness? Can't even expect that they won't be fired if they do take time off for illness?

Cross your fingers, friends, but don't hold your breath. The disease is coming to your community."
2020-02-25 18:30,So reassuring to hear Trump say it will all work out. Of course he’s only saying that in hopes the stock market won’t continue to slide and hurt his chances for re-election. I’m shocked he hasn’t dismissed the whole thing as some Deep State hoax. Still time for that I suppose.

I visited the Chinese media’s official website (link below) which carried a report on the speech, and translated the text from Chinese into English.  Xi used such words as “grim,” “complex’” “ordeal,” “critical,” “crushed.”  And then there is “bite the bullet.""  Anyone who has studied communist party political phraseology and vocabulary will know that such language is meant to communicate a dire situation inside the country, far more serious than that which Chinese media and spokesman are portraying publicly.

Trump official overseeing pandemic readiness exits

“A top official who would lead the U.S. response if a deadly pandemic broke out has left the administration amid a broad reorganization of the national security team, The Washington Post reported Thursday.

Rear Adm. Timothy Ziemer left the National Security Council (NSC) this week, and national security adviser John Bolton dissolved the global health security team that Ziemer oversaw.

The Post reported that Ziemer will not be replaced, and that his departure means that there is no single official at the highest levels of the administration who focuses only on global health security.”

2/10/20 - Donald Trump told supporters at a rally in New Hampshire that the virus will be gone by April, claiming that when temperatures rise, “the virus” will “miraculously” go away. Trump offered no scientific or medical explanation to support his theory.
“The virus that we’re talking about having to do, a lot of people think that goes away in April, with the heat, as the heat comes in, typically that will go away in April,”"

—Listen to your health care practitioners. Trust them. They have earned the privilege."

2020-02-25 18:21,"What the heck is the “Novel Coronavirus”? We should be able to at LEAST consistently NAME the problem by now, yes? I’m moderately literate about science in general, and medical science in particular, but it seems like the real pandemic here is “Chicken Little Syndrome.” The culture of lies, evasion, panic and conspiracy is finally becoming a worldwide threat. 

We need—particularly NOW—educated and consistent information, and we are beginning
to reap the consequences of disinformation and the distance between rich and the “rest” of
us."
2020-02-25 18:18,"Wash your hands. Don't panic. Don't repeat alarmist posts and misinformation. Realize that flu has already hit 22,000,000 Americans this year, with 30K deaths likely EVERY year, yet we don't panic and lock ourselves away. Good grief."
2020-02-25 18:03,“That it might be bad.” ??   A disaster of epic proportions is more like it.
2020-02-25 18:09,"Better hope the CDC and local authorities don’t botch this situation as badly as local authorities and FEMA have botched natural disaster response. 

Not looking optimistic being that Trump is president and many of his supporters are leaders in rural law enforcement. This should send shivers up your spine if you have any imagination whatsoever."
2020-02-25 18:12,"Since my post yesterday about transmission, it seems this virus is transmitted in the air/breathed in. No one seems to know how long it remains 'inactive' in the contaminated person(s). Nor is anyone sure if it needs a human host to spread or if traveling in the air is also sufficient. If it is the latter, no wall will stop its inevitable spread since we all breathe the same air (eventually). Trump doesn't need a billion $$ for committee of dummy-friends. All the money needs to go directly to the CDC to create an antidote prior to these cells making it across the pond. * For all the Trump lovers, this is what happens when you have an autocracy - the common people are not the primary concern in a crisis, only the opportunity to squander more money to his cronies."
2020-02-25 17:57,Thanks for the warning but what exactly are we supposed to do?
2020-02-25 18:19,"I love how people strive to find things to get hysterical about.  Is life so good that this is what keeps us up at night?

2020-02-25 17:50,"Americans need to be reminded that the President dismantled our entire pandemic response chain of command prior to the Coronavirus epidemic.  He will have great difficulty lying his way out of the consequences should the epidemic, or pandemic, hit the US hard. Belying the old adage that “dead men tell no tales,” dead men, women and children will, in fact, point the finger at the astonishing level of incompetence of the Trump administration. A hollowed-out executive branch is no match for a real crisis."
2020-02-25 18:16,"Our private-entity health care system will fail miserably if the Covid-19 pandemic hits the US as predicted. Our healthcare facilities are designed for maximum profit and efficiency, to only handle what is routinely expected. Empty hospital beds don't make money. This may get very ugly."
2020-02-25 18:39,"I was in a hardware store the other day and there was mom and her young daughter both wearing masks. It seemed out of place at the time, but maybe they were just ahead of the curve."
2020-02-25 18:39,"As a physician, I hope that this leads us to rethink how we approach disease control/management and healthcare in general.  

As it stands, the health department prevents me from having a dog in my office, yet my patients with potentially contagious diseases are free to walk in and sit next to each other in the waiting room. When was the last time you caught the flu from your pet? Asking a sick patient to put a mask on in the waiting room is treated like a privacy violation. Never mind the chaos that occurs in the hospital setting.  

We are more likely to be wiped out by a virus than the 'bomb'.  Just imagine if we took a quarter of our military spending and put it into better tools for disease management.

Imagine  viral test kits fast-tracked and delivered by drone/etc to those who log on to a GPS-tracked, symptom checker phone app for influenza or potential pandemic causing viruses.  Then those who know they have the disease (who are now tracked by their data) can contact or go to special triage units that have been separated from the general population.  Imagine phone alerts going out announcing protocols and protective measures to be taken instead of relying on scanty breaking news alerts filled with misinformation.   Ah, one can imagine."

The assessment should be made public, he wrote on Twitter, and people ‘would be as appalled and astonished’ as I am by the inadequacy of preparedness and prevention.”

Why is it classified? I don’t think it’s a matter of national security, it’s a matter of public health."
2020-02-25 18:28,"Trump’s comment that “I think the whole situation will start working out,” displays a willful ignorance, and is reflective of his desire to change reality to suit his own needs. This is the kind of comment you’d expect from the average citizen, but is totally inappropriate coming from the President of the United States. I fear that he’ll start altering important official information, much the same way as he did with Hurricane Dorian. And when agency officials refuse to play by his rules, Trump will replace them with inexperienced sycophants. We used to worry about a potential Constitutional crisis. Instead, we’re headed for a humanitarian crisis."

Can we please focus our discussion on possible solutions, effective responses, and helpful information, instead of this blame and attack?"
2020-02-25 18:36,"Since Republicans cut their budget, they have just enough resources to tell us we’re on our own."
2020-02-25 18:42,I have utterly no confidence that the Trump administration can handle a pandemic. His administration doesn't inspire confidence that they understand the real threat or that they have plans in place to address it when it hits our shores.
2020-02-25 18:34,"""It said the severe measures imposed by the Chinese authorities to isolate patients ..""

Isolationist measures from China?  Thankfully we have a chief executive who won't dilly dally long to make that decision.  Hopefully the Democrats in Congress will not try to cut their noses to spite their faces.  With them you never know though."
2020-02-25 18:37,"An administration staffed with political hacks, sycophants and science deniers seems uniquely unsuited to handling this epidemic. This may be a rough ride, particularly in a country with a defunded public health system, and an understaffed hospital system."
2020-02-25 18:20,Coronavirus is just the flu. Anyone can die from any type of flu if they don't take care of themselves. Someone who died from Coronavirus would most likely died from any type of flu.
2020-02-25 18:30,"Agreed that as of now the total number of infected is insignificant compared to 7 billion, but this is  spreading exponentially which is worrisome. What if I told you that if you catch this virus there is a 1 in 50 odd that you will die. We screen everyone for cancer although the odds of dying from cancer is far less. Agreed that there is always a media hype and most news are overblown, but personally I'm worried and putting off any travel plans for the rest of the year, and I'm sure a lot of people are, that's a big hit for travel and tourism if nothing else."
2020-02-25 18:40,"Lost in this issue is the fact that the billions of dollars diverted to an unneeded border wall could have months ago been directed to epidemic preparedness.

2020-02-25 18:26,"Perfect.  So three years into an inept administration and led by an incoherent human who cares more about what people think of him rather than actually thinking himself, we have arrived here.

It will be interesting to see how the administration manages this.  As a public health professional, I can assure you they will not.  They do not have the actual scientific brainpower to think strategically about the virus, nor a willingness to listen to those who do.

Prepare yourselves is exactly right."
2020-02-25 18:26,"We can thank Trump for bringing Covid19 to the US as his state Dept brought home 36 infected people from Princess Diamond, more than doubling number of cases on US soil.  This is how to make America great again by infecting it with coronavirus."
2020-02-25 18:29,Covid19 looks like it could be a real national emergency.  That's where the money that Trump took from the defense budget to build his cherished wall should come from.  No new money from taxpayers.

I agree with the US Centers for Disease Control assessment that it is now WHEN COvid-19 will get to the United States not IF.  I also urge the proper authorities to quarantine people coming into the USA from South Korea, Italy, and Japan!"
2020-02-25 17:43,"Trump cut the budget for the Center for Disease Control For some reason, Trump thought nothing bad would ever happen on his watch, so he's cut the budgets to all government agencies that exist to help the public.

2020-02-25 18:37,Trump loves crowds at his rallies. Perfect conditions for spreading this. Wouldn't it be ironic if he caught it.
2020-02-25 18:42,I was not reassured by two notoriously inaccurate commenter's voices today. Limbaugh says the coronavirus is just the common cold. And Kudlow says nothing to worry about - as he said before the 2008 financial meltdown.
2020-02-25 18:11,As soon as we start testing for this virus we are going to find it.  I fully believe the virus is already circulating in the community. It's virtually indistinguishable from many respiratory viral illnesses and co-infection with flu /rsv ect. was shown in China.  Volume of patients requiring ICU level care was much higher than usually for Jan. at my hospital.
2020-02-25 18:31,"It seems the coordinated strategy against the coronavirus in western media, including this newspaper, is to criticize China’s efforts to combat it. This, despite the fact that China has contained it to a few dozen thousand people in a country of 1.4b, on the eve of Chinese New Year travel. We can only hope others can match what China has accomplished. By the looks of it so far, I’ll take the under."
2020-02-25 18:01,"What is the purpose of this CDC warning? There is plenty that government, hospitals, and other organizations can do. But what can the people do? Do they want folks to panic? Start stocking food?"
2020-02-25 18:16,"Many Americans now live in a post fact world, BUT in his fiscal 2020 federal budget, Donald Trump ""shrewdly"" prepared America for Coronavirus when he recommending huge cuts across the federal government, including a 12 percent cut to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and a 10 percent cut for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention."
2020-02-25 18:32,"What my biggest fear is, is that Trump will override the expert advice from both the CDC and the National Institutes of Health.  My next fear is that his MAGA family will believe him and his gospel of destruction and that his Republican Congress will be silent.   Meanwhile, let us all be cautious.  Avoid large crowds whenever possible, and let our mantra be, WASH THY HANDS.  Above all do not panic.   We will get through this."
2020-02-25 18:42,"And yet not a single Democratic  presidential  candidate has addressed pandemic unpreparedness and the grossly incompetent Trump Administration grossly negligent failure to declare a state of emergency and stockpile antivirals and preposition infection control garb, supplies and surge capacity and to federalize our national response to assure coordination and an efficient allocation of resources.  We may see between 2 and 6 million deaths and totally lack the ability to maintain commerce and our supply chains and we lack adequate hospital beds, CCU, ICU, negative pressure room and biohazard garb for healthcare workers.  We are months away from a vaccine (and that is extremely optimistic) and we may see mass casualties among transplant patients, immuno-compromised patients, COPD patients, the elderly and yes politicians such as Trump and Sanders.  What is coming at us is nothing short of a national disaster which will have dramatic societal, economic and political impacts and shut down our schools, stores and commerce for months.   Early screening and detection and treatment with antivirals are key but we lack the testing kits, the stockpiles of drugs and the  training of local departments of health.  This is going to be much worse than bad as we have the most inefficient and incompetent Presidential administration in power at the worse possible time."
2020-02-25 17:45,"Unless there is a countrywide lockdown (like, no planes in or out), there will be cases.  Do we know the gestation time for this virus?  I've never heard it."

or die with whatever dignity might be possible. To plunge into the public health miasma? I try to avoid it when I am healthy. I wouldn't go near if I was sick."
2020-02-25 18:43,"And what precisely does the CDC suggest we members of the public do to “ prepare” for a widespread outbreak in the US? Stock up on food and water so we can shelter in place? Cancel domestic and foreign travel plans? Unlike the flu, there is no vaccine, so we can’t do that. Frequent hand washing goes without saying, and who doesn’t do that anyway? The warning is pretty useless without some concrete guidance."
2020-02-25 18:07,"It would be helpful if the government or the media explained what the public should expect, not just a vague “get ready”.  How should we get ready? How is it transmitted, can we do anything to reduce the risk? Do we still have a Surgeon General? Haven’t heard a peep from them if we do. I bought a box of face masks yesterday, the last one available for miles around, according to the Pharmacist. Selling out locally or for extortionate prices online. Please advise."
2020-02-25 18:07,"Is it time for another intervention by Trump, maybe with another altered map like the one he used to contradict the NWS hurricane scientists?  Maybe he, Xi, and the Ayatollah can meet and congratulate each other on the eradication of the coronavirus.  

Trouble is, some evidence just can't be ignored or reshaped, even by a con man as practiced as Trump.  There is no substitute for the hard work of data collection, thoughtful analysis, and carefully implemented action plans.  Our emperor is clothes-less, and it is not a pretty sight."
2020-02-25 17:46,"What precisely if the U.S. Government and CDC doing to plan for this outbreak they are warning us about? What preparations are we making to handle the medical crises this will create?

It's not enough to warn us. We need our government to tell us they have our backs."
2020-02-25 17:48,"There would be nothing like a global pandemic to expose how bad the private health care model in the US really is. It has not been tested in this way before but it's fairly obvious but many poor people will not approach hospitals, fearing the cost and thinking that they can just battle through the flu. Perhaps the Republicans, their supporters and the people who vote for them will finally be faced with the consequences of their moral bankruptcy."
2020-02-25 17:49,Putting people and the health system on alert is one thing and spreading panic is another. I hope CDC has struck the right note.
2020-02-25 17:58,"It looks like Trump is on top this. I wonder how his 87 Billion budget cut to Health and Human Services to pay for military spending and his wall will affect our response, especially for the poor who have no medical insurance?"
2020-02-25 18:28,"As we know it today, the global economy began in the 1970s when President Nixon ended the Bretton Woods global economic system created in 1944 and abandoned the American gold standard. Since then, multinational banks and corporations have maintained dominant and essentially unchallenged power in the political economies of all countries. However, as we see with the coronavirus, the lack of international agreements with financial, human, and technical resources providing for the common good of all nations is now challenging the hegemony of international finance.

The advice to look for symptoms is too little too late since we know asymptomatic infected people are contagious. 

Our CDC is too complacent and too slow. Bizarrely, why does the world superpower need one federal agency to give the rest of the country the capability to test the virus? Are all the state level health agencies, and individual hospitals so technologically backward?

I think if there is an outbreak here, American healthcare system will fare worse than China. The high cost of hospitalization and drugs, the millions who are uninsured or under insured will delay people getting proper treatment and proper quarantine and therefore worsen the outbreak. In a country where everything is about profit and liability, responsibility will be pushed around, like Costa Mesa suing not to have coronavirus patients quarantined in their city.

Remember, the death rate for the 50s and up who otherwise have stable health is not 2% but much higher. 

Until the virus is actually here, we should not give up. It may not be too late for the US to avoid an outbreak. We need the political will to accept some economic set back, or selfishly chance an outbreak would not affect ""me"" therefore let things be.

Only three of the more than 100 public health labs across the country have verified the CDC test for use, according to the Association of Public Health Laboratories.

The delay in establishing additional screening capacity could impede the U.S. government’s ability to detect scattered cases before they snowball into larger outbreaks, former FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb told POLITICO.

The bubonic plague struck Europe and portions of other continents, mercilessly decimating huge chunks the populations leaving behind empty towns. Christians viewed this as the almighty’s way of warning us for abdicating from Christian norms. Others viewed it as a Malthusian way of correcting the population explosion. Add to that, some scientists attributed the exponential spread of the disease due to illiteracy. They might have been right. Sincerely, who cared about washing their hands in the Middle Ages? 
In the aftermath of the bubonic pandemic, awareness of how to protect oneself from falling sick must have been one of the positive dynamics of stopping the person to person infection. The plague also became a reminder at this point in time, that somewhere lies a dangerous virus ready to strike at will, leaving behind it destruction and suffering. It could spare no one from the ravages. 
In the novel by Albert Camus - The plague,  Camus tells us about how the people of the city of Oran, in Algeria, changed their ways for good after coming to terms with the plague.

All precautions should be taken to reduce the rate of spreading, including cancellation of flights and public gatherings but overreacting can make it worse. The reality is that the virus has escaped and nothing will contain it anymore. Now the focus should be on getting the rate of spreading to below 2 (the zero rate is now impossible) and on surviving the pandemic (helping the health workers, for example). It will burn itself out eventually. That said, my eyes are on Italy where the data reported are most accurate. WHO is in China's pocket, Iran is being Iran and S.

We are regularly admonished to wash our hands during cold and flu season and stay home rather than go to work or be in public places. At the moment we have the capacity for Skype type meetings. Why not do all of that? Then practice vigilant sanitary practices and teach them to our children.

Where soaps are not around, sanitizers can do the same job of soaps. C.D.C. can do US great service if it keeps monitoring the public and letting us know where the new cases are in the USA. 

Restrict TRAVEL to and from places in the world where Corona cases are. Educate the people about how to prevent and be treated for any Corona infection. Also avoiding closed crowded places will be of paramount importance if things get out of hand. At the same time it is very important to chill out, stay calm and think of ways that will allow our immunity to stay strong especially, the seniors are vulnerable to morbidity and mortality due to a weakening immune system with age. My father who is in his 101th year has been given a balanced diet with vitamins and mineral supplements along with fruit juices especially pomegranate juice, which global scientific studies have shown to have antiviral compounds that can neutralize multiple enveloped viruses.

The only thing that will stop it is a vaccine, and even that won’t be enough if this virus turns out to be able to mutate like the flu. If it is the case that it can mutate on a regular basis we will just have to live with it until we can co-evolve with it to be less virulent, which could take a very long time and a lot of deaths along the way. In some ways we’re lucky that this is happening with a virus which doesn’t have a higher mortality rate, but with recombination and mutation that might be in the horizon too. 

And with respect to the virus spread slowing in China that’s great, but only due to people being locked in their homes, which isn’t a sustainable way to live. As soon as people become more mobile and social again the virus will continue to spread in China again...like the flu.

All of this has been predicted by scientists for awhile now by the way. It’s just that like with climate change, it seems to be a human (or government) trait to not take impending disaster seriously until it’s on our doorstep and is practically too late.

What that tells me, assuming China is not just making up numbers that China has got a grip of the dire situation with  restrictions, quarantines, building special hospitals for treating patients. It had experience from SARS in containing and eradicating past viral infections. It also seems to have successfully adopted a multi-pronged strategy to stop the spread by all means possible. Where there is a will, there is way. Any country that does not prepare and does not restrict travel from and to the epicenter of Corona in China is doomed to live to regret it. 

Iran has depended on China for its trade after the sanctions from the west and there is a lot of exchanges between the 2 countries. Iran's neighbors Pakistan and Turkey have closed their borders with Iran and travel to and from Iran should be restricted immediately. Areas of Iran like Tehran are densely populated and spread could be expected to occur fast. All sanctions against Iran by the west on humanitarian stuffs like food and medicines, masks, gloves, gowns, devices to assist in breathing should be lifted immediately so that the Persian masses are not left to the vagaries of Corona infections which can range from mild symptoms to difficulty breathing to death especially in seniors with week immune system.

The newest virus does not recognize any borders, both within and between countries. In fact, in the age of globalization, all viruses do so. When the virus goes global, the local will suffer the most if the latter has no idea what hits it.

CDC is absolutely right: Americans should be prepared for the spread of the disease before it is too late. The local governments, especially at the city level, should start regulating the distribution of medical masks among citizens when the situation is still controllable and manageable. 

Taiwan’s approach to the scarcity of masks may be useful: Citizens now need to use their health card to buy two masks once every week. Children can buy more. The number is probably not adequate, but it allows those who may need the masks a reasonable access to get them."

Our stable genius is oblivious to what is going on. Or as one article put it, perhaps this is the Black Swan that will prove to be Trump's undoing. If he understood political show business as well as he understands circus acts he'd be at a podium yesterday telling us exactly what are the risks and what we are doing to combat them.

Disneyland is minutes away, 18 million visitors annually and 201,000 employees.. Parents will stay away and Disneyland will be a ghost town when an employee or tourist gets the virus.. In 2018, Orange County had 50.16 million visitors.  Lost revenues would be billions. It would be impossible to check everyone who comes in contact with an escaping  patient or employee spreading the virus.  3,000 health-care workers are infected.

We are certainly more open and therefore better informed. But will our response be adequate and as well organized as the Chinese one finally became?

2020-02-25 22:51,"I don't think you really know how many cases are in China. One should never believe that the Chinese are going to tell the truth. You really shouldn't expect it from our dictatorship either. It is doubtful that all people who get it will go and get tested either here in the US or elsewhere. It is a flu that at worst kills upwards of 2% which is to say that most people survive it, like almost everyone. It is also likely that the real death rate is far lower than 2% and probably closer to 0.3% (if you look at the report on deaths among hospital workers you see that the deaths were 6 and cases 1700). 

Again, I don't think anyone knows and pretending that governments like Xi's and Trump's are going to tell the truth  is a bit suspect. People who lie constantly don't change just because you might be concerned. 

On a side note, I am quite enjoying watching the markets freak out. It really indicates that they are devoid of scientific understanding, and thus are destined for a collapse regardless of what should transpire from this virus. Our leaders are fascist and our financial wizards are ignorant of reality. I do not believe that is a winning strategy."

The reality of the situation is that less than one hundredth of one percent of people on Earth have been infected with this virus. Do you have any idea how few people that is?

The damage being done to the world economy isn’t a result of science driven policy as a result of a novel virus. The damage being done to the world is because of xenophobia, irrational panic (which is stoked by the media who are profiting off of the panic they are causing), and a lack of knowledge of the science and facts regarding viral infections.

It makes me so angry that this cycle keeps happening. It happened with SARS, with bird flu, and swine flu. Every single time, the virus pops up, media companies do everything in their power to stir people into mania driven panic, then the virus subsides and the Earth keeps spinning. It also makes me angry that the public hasn’t learned ANYTHING from previous viral outbreaks either. Kills me."

You see my point. If catching cases and acting early to prevent further spread is so important, why have we not been testing more widely in the U.S.? (Maybe there are good reasons, but I would like to hear them.)

Only in the winter time do they trade.  Russia traded military items like trucks and China food stuff such as grains.   The hotel industry in Russia is in the escort business.  And the Chinese business men love it because it doesn't exist in the city across the Amur.  What is concerning is neither side has any infrastructure hospitals, medicine, doctors, nurses, facilities to combat the coronavirus.  These two cities are third world.

Everyone we spoke to on the Chinese side said that interaction between their two countries has significantly declined since the Russian Ruble devaluation in 2014. Further compounding the problem is that the border economy has historically relied on petty trading (prices were cheaper for different products on both sides) which has been almost entirely wiped out due to the rise of internet commerce. People there are struggling, and it remains to be seen if the bridge mentioned in the article will lead to meaningful opportunities for residents on either side.

On one hand we’re being told that as many as 600,000 people world wide die from the flu each year, but so far “only” 2,200 have died from coronavirus. Yet we see 3 billion people in China are basically under quarantine and there are 5-10 cases each in other countries that are causing alarm. Add to that, the stock market is falling on the news and flights and cruises are being cancelled and much more. So... just how serious is coronavirus?  Is coronavirus the beginnings of a worldwide disaster or an over reaction?  It seems the response is oversized in relation to the stated numbers of those infected and the mortality rate. What to believe?"

And even if there were, compliance is low.  All the quarantines, border closings and temperature takings are just publicity stunts to appease a nervous public.  The government has to be seen as taking action (otherwise how can they hope to get reelected) even if all the actions are futile.  Governments will even lie by underreporting the infection and death rates.  They rationalize their lies by telling themselves they do not want to cause a panic or hurt the economy (especially tourism dependent countries with autocrats like the Philippines, Thailand and Cambodia)  The only hope for those with weakened immune systems and underlying respiratory issues is to self isolate in a remote area and hope a vaccine is invented prior to being exposed.

Trump’s only concern will be self-protection from the virus. He and his family do not care. The GOP cares only about their personal political power. The true government patriots, the civil servants, have been labeled “ the swamp and deep state.” Medical researchers have been pushed out by ruthless and ignorant corrupt Trump supporters.

Nothing. W ea re going on our third month with this virus, this didn't start yesterday, where is the information, where is the action.

It seems impossible that the stable genius in the White House, well advanced on his path of dismantling our scientific & medical infrastructure, will have any credible response to the multiple intensifying crisis. There is already clear evidence that the spread of Covid-19 is under-reported in the United States. The real question has become how deep and how severe will the economic damage extend. The current accelerating global decline in production and commodity prices suggests a depression as the most likely future experience for the western economies. Less affluent nations, with poorly developed healthcare services, face a real possibility of a more general social & political collapse, with the civil violence and mass refugee flows that are likely to follow.

My wife and I have canceled a Baltic cruise for this June because: 

1. Most cruise lines reserve the right to alter or curtail the schedule/itinerary without refunds; and cancel-for-any reason insurance will be about half the cost of the cruise. 

2. We are both over 70 and thus at higher risk of becoming seriously ill or even dying from COVID-19 if we catch it. 

3. In the best of times cruise ships are floating Petri dishes that easily spread noroviruses; note the current COVID-19 transmissions on the Diamond Princess and Holland America Westerdam. 

4. While our cruise ports are in countries that now have fewer than 25 cases, the coronavirus could become a pandemic affecting thousands in many countries, including those on our itinerary. Our nightmare scenario is that we or other passengers contract the disease aboard or in port. Do we want to be treated or quarantined on the ship or in Europe where Medicare is not accepted? No way. 

For us the medical/financial risks are just too great, so for 2020 we are planning to limit our travel to US destinations we can reach easily by car or short flights. 

Over time we will evaluate the coronavirus situation and see how cruise lines and foreign countries are coping. There’s always next year. 

For medical advice, talk to your doctor. For travel advice, talk to your travel agent, carrier and insurance agent."

Why do we assume cruise ship passengers who are asymptomatic are not carriers? What is our program for vaccine development? What provisional emergency planning is going on? What panels of experts are advising Trump.

My grandparent died in the Spanish Flu. I want no such recurrence of a pandemic now. Yes, there is a political campaign, but our president needs to be leading, not reacting, to this crisis.

Schools, public offices, museums and the like are closed, soccer matches are cancelled (that's how you know it's really serious!). New cases pop up every day in different regions, and public health officials are scrambling to trace the connections between them. The identity of patient 0 remains a mystery- possibly forever. 

And yet. People continue to live their lives here. Elderly people drink coffee at the neighborhood bar, we go grocery shopping (there's still food on the shelves, it's not urban warfare), children play at the park like it's a public holiday. What else can we do? Some people are afraid, but in the end this story will play out as it will. (And let's be honest- climate change is a far, far deadlier threat to humankind than coronavirus). So why not live happily and fully, hug our children, call our parents because for all of us each new day is a gift. 

Ignorance and fear is never the answer. Giving up is never the answer."

While the virus could not be contained, even with China's draconian measures, it was undoubtedly slowed.

I hope that we have been preparing and making plans regarding some of our particular vulnerabilities.

2020-02-24 15:40,"As the spread of corona virus indicates, quarantine and public health measures may not be enough, by themselves, to prevent a pandemic.

It’s also going to take the development of new drugs, re-purposing of existing drugs, and hopefully invention of safe and effective vaccines.  We can do this.

A few years ago, the threat was from Ebola. There were no effective vaccines or treatments. Today, both vaccines and effective drugs are in the late stages of testing, and we have good reason to be optimistic.

As with Ebola, advances against coronavirus will require synergistic work by government, academia, and, yes, pharmaceutical companies. Working together they can lick this.

But, there is a problem. Drug companies face an existential threat to their viability: American tort lawyers. This is not an exaggeration. Lawyers have won many multi-billion dollar suits against both American and foreign drug companies, based largely on junk science and playing on emotion. Literally tens of thousands more suits are pending.

A few decades ago, lawyers nearly shut down vaccine development in the US. Only an 11th hour no-fault liability law by Congress allowed the continued availability of vaccines in this country.  

Congress needs to act and legislate tort reform, before pharmaceutical firms are driven out of business, a very real possibility. We should not eliminate torts, but we need to reform the law that governs them through Federal legislation."

Also making sure that our family finances are in perfect order. That kind of thing. I don't think there's really any doubt that we will eventually see a significant outbreak, and I'd like to be prepared to stay safe and healthy."
2020-02-24 15:47,"We need to keep our eye on all the numbers, not just the deaths and the cases confirmed by testing. 
Take a look at the number of people who got it but did not even know it. (e.g., 60 of 88 in one tranche of  the cruise ship cases). 
 
Take a look at people who were tested, quarantined, and did did not have serious complications.  Numbers should be available from the Chinese hospitals where they took in everybody who tested positive as a quarantine method - versus a classic healthcare decision.

Early reporting - or more to the point, non-reporting  - on these numbers indicates a huge set of people who are not seriously impacted.
This should allow us to focus where it matters as the virus spreads: the patients that will be - or are - seriously impacted. Because containment is not a realistic goal."
2020-02-24 15:58,"Infectious disease experts claim that ""It’s now clear that the epidemic was never going to be contained."" in an accompanying op-ed today. As a physician it is shocking to hear an expert express such a fatalistic attitude. 

That may be true but what stands out to me in the handling of this epidemic is how poor the response has been. It seemed quite common to hear the opinion at the beginning of the epidemic that this was China's problem. Even when the epidemic was rapidly spreading there was little information on the actual symptoms and what was happening medically. 

I happened to be on an airline flight shortly after the epidemic started. Many people were coughing. No one had a mask on. And still, there is no public pronouncements regarding masks in the US. At very minimum, no one should have been allowed into a confined public space without a mask. Experts may counter that the masks are not 100% effective and they allow a false sense of security. However, if they prevent 50 to 90% of transmission is that not a good thing? 

The management of the cruise ship quarantine was the most deficient attempt at communicable disease control imaginable. Confining 3700 passengers on a ship suffering an outbreak of a respiratory illness without adequate medical ventilatory controls only served to demonstrate how virulent the virus can be. 

I will believe that the virus cannot be contained when I see an adequate effort to actually contain it."

Another difference is that much of our housing is not dense housing, and viruses will not be spread through air ducts; this is very different in China, where most housing likely shares air ventilation, and housing is many stories high.
Fortunately, no one demonstrated when our citizens, who needed housing and quarantine, were able to stay at military bases in California and Texas.  Those ill need to find a place to get treatment.  Orange County, specifically Costa Mesa, has refused to house these citizens in buildings a distance from their town.

2020-02-24 19:10,Read the piece in today’s Times “Is the Coronavirus Outbreak a Pandemic  Yet?”.  As noted there every country in the world needs thoughtful and precise planning which of course seems to be happening almost nowhere. Mass quarantines and wearing surgical masks will have little to no effect on the devastation of this pandemic but seem to be the only response that most governments pursue. I agree with the concerns about the response of the U.S. given the current administration’s tendency to ignore objective scientific evidence in favor of politically driven propaganda. Hopefully enough dedicated and intelligent public health professionals have survived the purges to help direct our response but as stated in the article our health care system is about to be overwhelmed. Those who brush this off with comparisons to influenza fail to understand that at least from what we know now this virus is probably about 20 times as lethal. With likely proportionate rates of severe disease requiring hospital and ICU care no country has the capacity to manage this outbreak given the expected burden of disease.

My second concern is the origins of the virus: from this and other articles it seems to have arisen from markets where wildlife is sold for consumption. It seems this was the origin of SARS, too. I commend the Chines government for at least temporarily banning the consumption of wildlife but wonder if researchers will be able to definitively find the point of origin so that we can better prevent this in the future.

There is NO justification for WHO evading their duty to prepare the public for what is very likely to happen. (Economic stability is not justification for helping a lying regime mislead the world.)
I do realize the WHO are essentially an entity of international cooperation (i.e., global politics), and they use health as their 'channel,' but the refusal to acknowledge the absurd data coming from China, coupled with the WHO's complaints about misinformation on the web, and then complimenting the behavior of the Chinese authorities... Let's just say: I'm well-past furious and they've lost the trust of this particular Public Health 'true believer.' It's difficult to write this, but I'm done with the WHO.

This demonstrates the fatal flaw of authoritarian rule, reality and facts don’t adhere to party ideology. A virus doesn’t care if this is a bad time for an authoritarian leader for a virus to begin jumping borders. A virus is going to do what viruses do, regardless of politics.

""Anniston, Alabama, Mayor Jack Draper said based on a series of meetings with the Department of Health and Human Services, they were not prepared to handle coronavirus patients.

""'We're simply not prepared to help our fellow citizens, at this time, who have been diagnosed with this disease,' Draper said.
The US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) told Alabama Gov. Kay Ivey on Friday it was evaluating the possibility of using a Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) Center for Domestic Preparedness in Anniston as a backup location for some Americans infected by the virus, according to statements from the Alabama Department of Public Health (ADPH) and the governor's office.

I wonder about our ability to do the same in the U.S. when our testing capacity seems so much smaller and slower.

Image: Washington State releases hundreds of people from “public health supervision” over the coronavirus; tests NONE of them for the virus

(Natural News) This tells you everything you need to know about how U.S. states plan to handle the coronavirus outbreak: Refrain from testing anyone and then report “zero community outbreaks.”

Last week, the State of Washington was monitoring 794 people for coronavirus symptoms. Yet by Friday of last week, the state had only tested a grand total of 28 people for the virus.

Today, the 794 number has fallen to 582, according to the Washington Dept. of Health website.

This means over 200 people have been released from “public health supervision,” yet the total number of people tested for the coronavirus in Washington remains at 28.

In other words, zero new people were tested."

The WHO really needs to stop parroting & praising China, trump too of course."
2020-02-25 2:02,"This virus, similar to influenza, may not be a 'pandemic', but it offers countries on a global basis, a window-in-time to make preparations for one.

Here the Public has been informed that there may not be a vaccine for another year, and scientists world-wide are in overdrive to contain this outbreak.

As of now, there have been no official reports of this disease from Africa, or South America, but this could change.

One hundred years ago, there was a virulent outbreak of influenza in Europe and beyond.  It might help to know how it was finally contained in an era that was not as advanced in the field of medicine and science.

With caring thoughts of those ailing, or suffering from this outbreak no matter where, The World Health Organization, its team, and other agencies are to be commended in this rush to protect and save human lives, with the help of responsible nations."
2020-02-25 2:39,"I am thrilled that quarantining is happening; it's the only way to break the back of the spread of infection. In 1918, it was really the only tool in the tool box. But I've been wondering how this is working on a financial front.

 Does anyone know what happens when the CDC, rightly, mandates quarantine? Who, exactly, is paying for the fourteen days of missed work? I'm always the first to put human needs before any financial consideration, but I have been wondering about this.

 I work in a private school and we only get five paid sick days. We've been clobbered all fall and winter with serious flu outbreaks, so many of us are already maxed out. In situations like this, when a government mandates school and business closures-- as is happening now in Italy and may still happen here-- who picks up the tab? Are workers' salaries docked?  Because if that's the case, this becomes a catastrophe of a different order. 

I'm a life long saver who plans for the proverbial rainy day, but keep in mind, the average American family could not, according to a recent study, come up with four-hundred dollars much less 1/2 a month missed work and the attending medical bills. 

This is why I've been calling ever since the SARS outbreak for an international planning committee whose sole focus is planning for every facet of a pandemic and  global climate crisis fallout, not just the most evident or urgent ones. We can learn from this terrible crisis, but we have to act fast."

So they were a little hesitant in declaring it as a crisis. But those guys in charge also had to consider hundreds of factors that no casual commentator needs to worry about before doing so. 

In some aspects, China did good. In others, not so good. That's just how life/reality is. Could America have handled it better? Maybe, maybe not.

2020-02-25 2:48,"I studied public health at Johns Hopkins and I don't get the rationale for the US policy on the virus.  On the one hand, the US says don't travel to China and all flights have been cancelled.  In the middle, there is now a high level of warning discouraging travel to South Korea, but maintaining flights.  Then, on the other hand, there is no similar advisory for Italy, which has had a fast growing outbreak in the north around Milan.  Personally, I doubt that containment will work or that its supposed benefits will outweigh social-economic costs harmful to health of the many.  However, if you are going to pursue containment, it cant be arbitrary and capricious forbidding Asian travel while ignoring Europe.  Bottom line is the US has a policy that is indefensible unless it is uniformly applied."

People need to understand that this virus is causing a serious health problem, and politicians and celebrities need to get out of the way and let the experts guide us to the best solutions.  Limbaugh should be chastised for his opinions.

2020-02-25 5:27,"So far the covid19 has been like lightning followed by a lot of panicked thunder all over the world. Very loud and peace disturbing but always a bit too late. Apart from the obvious evidence that the virus is infectious, I am dubious of the data from China, till international, non-political scientists let folks know that those who died, passed away primarily due to complications from the virus and not because of secondary issues, cytokines storms, secondary infections due to a personally compromised immune response, combinations of antiviral drugs, lack of proper nutrition, fear etc. So far in developed countries, the virus itself is as inconvenient as the cold or as horrid as a bad flu. What is stunning is the lack of coordination by the US government with our nations newspapers to disseminate helpful information in all local newspapers to educate the public. A few timely words would reassure the general public and prevent strange tales and complete misinformation and worse racist actions. I still am puzzled as to why it is largely leaving infants and children alone. Such a considerate virus. Or is it an irony that someone working on a vaccine against the nastier Corona, let lose an attenuated virus by themselves becoming infected? I wonder what those who inhaled are now immune to..."

2020-02-25 11:35,"The CDC estimates that since it started circulating in the spring of 2009, H1N1 has infected about 100 million Americans, killing about 75,000 and sending 936,000 to the hospital. A study published by PLOS Medicine in 2013 suggested between 123,000 and 200,000 people globally may have died as a result of the 2009 H1N1 pandemic.

Why don't we stop eating pork as well? We're criticizing China for the coronavirus because we're racist and scared. It wasn't our fault when swine flu (H1N1) broke out, we didn't blame the Mexicans when bird flu broke out, and we didn't blame the Brits when mad cow disease broke out.

2020-02-25 13:02,"It was inevitable. The crash of the greedy global economy built on using cheap labor and bypassing basic environmental or labor laws. This is squarely on China because it built wealth for some by feeding corporations people who worked in subhuman conditions.They can't reopen their manufacturing base because the conditions are an incubator for Coronavirus.

Now they are already warning of drug shortages. I grew up with relatives who worked and made good money working in pharmaceutical companies right here in NJ. Then those jobs were sent overseas with little to no oversight. Often hidden by the media are the deaths and injuries resulting from a lack of oversight due to contaminated drugs from overseas. I myself was a victim of such an incident,lucky I didn't die but disgusted with how nothing was done.

China and the globalists have tried but this they can't hide. It's like that  saying about Everything done in the dark eventually coming to light.

While this is a good news, the number of recovered patients 
continues to rise. Whether it is the turning point, it is still debatable.

China is moving again. Many important companies large and small already resume productions. Due to the virus screening process, companies and government jointly developed plans to minimize risks transferring migrant workers from interior provinces to their work places in the coastal areas.   The full productions no doubt will take time.  

China has sacrificed short term economic and social losses to buy time for other countries to prepare for the arriving of Coronavirus.  She has also informed WHO and put important Coronavirus information immediately on public database so that medical research can study and prepare for the vaccine.  It is up to individual country to handle the coming virus situation."

This is not good preparation in the world we live in. If you leave home anything might happen. Take enough of your blood pressure , diabetes or cardiac meds to tide you over in case of something like this.  I have no sympathy for people who run out of clean underwear when there is a sink and soap in their room and they basically have nothing much to do. And anyway they charge you a fortune to wash anything.
All along I was worried about the crew and nothing was said in the news media. We kept hearing  "" 14 passengers "".  And now we hear that no good procedures were followed for the crew's safety. This is unconscionable.
I actually like cruses and have been on several. I found that they were an excellent value for the considerable money and I've enjoyed seeing a lot of European cultural and historical sites under very comfortable and pretty safe conditions. And the staff was always lovely and they did share honestly some of their working conditions-long days with no breaks and missing their families but that it was a ""good job"" given their options. I would hate to see this destroy the industry but changes are clearly needed."

The virus is fully out with no putting it back in the bottle. Human error through and through. Public health deserves the very best leaders and a great deal more funding. Time to care more about public health, more about the fact that people will get very sick and many will die, including in the US, than about possible economic mayhem. Economic chaos will happen anyway and the more this spreads the worse everything gets.

For sure, if the ship had been evacuated, all guests placed in a quarantined institution for 15 days etc... all would be better. But in the real-time, fast moving, early days of the outbreak, making the wrong decision could also backfire and be subject to criticism. Now we know that on cruise ships, it is essentially impossible to practice good infection control (too many design constraints, narrow halls, many surfaces, people going stir crazy), and in future we will evacuate passengers into contained facilities immediately. And we'll know not to be too complacent (how much does it cost to hire the services of a full-time professional infection control practitioner to manage containment operations on the ship), but as I say, hindsight is 20:20 and this is a novel coronavirus (highly infectious, variable incubation period, possible asymptomatic transmission, fatality rate at least as high, but probably slightly higher than influenza) with which we have not encountered. SARS (moderately transmissible, fairly lethal) and MERS (less transmissibile, highly lethal) were different. With each outbreak, we learn more."
2020-02-22 18:34,Cruise ships almost be definition are viral disease factories.  My wife and I stopped cruising 10 years ago after enduring a second cruise involving a norovirus.  Horrible experience.

Cruise ships and viruses are a perfect storm.

2020-02-22 18:12,"We are totally unprepared for this virus in the United States. Americans, for the most part, are in total denial that this virus is even a thing. 

The evidence is mounting that infected persons can be both asymptomatic and superspreaders. It is increasingly likely that the maximum incubation period can be more than two weeks. There are reports that the virus can survive for a week or more on some surfaces. It goes without saying that this virus is susceptible to airborne transmission.

If you put these observations together, it is easy to imagine that six hours spent in the high density coach cabin of an airplane flying from New York to California with one asymptomatic superspreader could lead to the infection of dozens of persons, all of whom would then disperse upon their arrival in Los Angeles. 

From that point on it's just rinse and repeat. There is no way we are prepared for this. No way."
2020-02-22 18:29,"As I've said before, this is unconscionable and bordering on criminal.  I'm not a medical professional and even I could see that the ship was a slo-mo horror movie in the making. 

I blame our global leaders, who seem more interested in retaining and expanding their power than actually leading and solving problems.  This is the 21st century - the world's governments and institutions' response to the virus so far has been wholly underwhelming.

We can and should do better."
2020-02-22 18:57,"Your articles today on the infectivity of coronaviruses:   
First you say estrogen may make a difference in the difference in infection rates between men and women.  Show us a study of this with a suggested mechanism, i.e. how does estrogen affect the formation of MHC molecules, if it does?

Men smoke more in China than women, and therefore are more susceptible to worse outcomes from being infected.  Who sells cigarettes in China; is this a government monopoly?  What measures are taken to prevent smoking, and is the government seriously involved in this?

Why are outcomes less severe outside Hubei Province?  Is it because viral load is higher at time of infection in Hubei, or is a more virulent form of the virus present.  How would you test for this?  Viral load at time of infection appears to be important in other viruses, such as HIV.

The cruise ship phenomena appears to be viral load connected.  Is this the result of heavier load at the time of first infection, or multiple infections in a short period of time.  How is the immune system overcome; is it viral load or multiple iterations (from mutation) infecting at the same time?

Keep telling us the science here.  What all of this is saying, is that there needs to be more basic research into viruses, especially RNA viruses, which are more error prone in replication and produce higher mutation rates.  Is there any similarity between RT in viruses and RT (reverse transcriptase) that naturally occurs in the body?"

Laying in a supply of non perishable food and any necessary meds would be prudent.  Everyone should have some face masks on hand; good luck finding the better N95 types."
2020-02-22 18:41,"The Diamond Princess is NOT a luxury cruise ship.  

As a precaution, rather than letting passengers serve themselves, crew with gloves on their hands should have been serving the passengers as they would have done if the ship had norovirus."
2020-02-22 17:34,This is a GREAT lookback on one hell of a conundrum and free-for-all. Thank you for publishing this!
2020-02-22 19:16,"When I first saw images of this stricken ship, I saw people out on their decks directly next to others with only a barrier between.  I knew then that they were in trouble.  Air circulates very easy around these barriers and right into your neighbours clothes etc.   As the article mentions, cruise ships have a trac record for outbreaks of viruses.  I would only go on one in the summer and always carry my hand sanitiser.  Making sure to fully wash my hands before eating as it a great way to get a virus into your body."
2020-02-22 19:25,"The delay in quarantine is due to the normalcy bias and happens often during disasters. Especially one as esoteric as a cold like virus that presents some with mild symptoms. They should have been removed and quarantined in a larger area without shared air vents. 

I am shocked the CDC said there was no evidence it spread through air vents. While true, they had no evidence, they likely knew this was an airborne virus and should have intervened earlier. An aerosolized virus can stay in the air for hours. Six feet is also not enough separation between people to stop the spread of an aerosolized virus.

The passengers should still be quarantined for two weeks until no one else they shared close proximity with becomes infected."
2020-02-22 19:26,"I would really like to hear from the CDC and whoever is ""in charge"" of this for our government to hear, in detail, what the containment and treatment plans are."
2020-02-22 18:57,"Science Magazine this week dated 14 Feb 2020 says, ""The world is in the dark about the epidemic's scale and speed, because existing tests have limited powers -- and testing is too spotty.""

An expert, ""We are underestimating how common this infection is.""

The key facts are that:

** Tests are applied only to people who have developed symptoms, partly because people with limited symptoms don't go in for testing.

** The tests are not effective until the disease has progressed for several weeks.

** It is unknown how soon an infected victim becomes contagious.

** There is no known cure nor any knowledge of how effective prescription general anti-virus medications may be.

Our President called President Xi and was told that the disease is under control, and Trump believed that Xi would tell him the truth. Interesting that a liar believes other liars.

It is time that large respected media sources, certainly the NYT -- one of the country's leaders in providing information -- start hounding Mr. Trump to  be absolutely sure that resources are available, NOW,  to organizations like the CDC with assistance from the NIH and private research labs to ensure that quarantine protocols are in place and that a vaccine is available as soon as possible.

Our incompetent fool of a President is in the process of cutting funding to appropriate scientific medical R&D organizations.

Trump needs to act ASAP.  He won't do it without media pressure!!!!"
2020-02-22 18:38,These quarantines are terrible.  We can all take care of ourselves.  Let them be.

2020-02-22 18:33,"The dumbest thing I have heard in this virus fiasco was allowing 14 infected people to travel on the same transport as many, many others who were not.  Did the government think one plane would be cheaper?  Did they think that everyone on that plane would not be breathing the same air within this little “can” with wings? When bureaucrats make medical decisions you can be sure a lot of people will get sick."
2020-02-22 18:47,"I was on a cruise where the boat alone cost $14,000. Some of the folks were totally oblivious. Foolishness is everywhere despite there being only 340 of us dumb enough to pay that. Yes, I include myself in that group. 1st & last cruise I'll ever go on. Every venue had a Purell dispenser. Yay! No germs for us!"
2020-02-22 18:05,"I am beyond surprised that you are not reporting about the fact that Italy, in a matter of two days, went from a few isolated cases to a sudden 18 then 50 cases as from today, with two deaths and now 50.000 people pretty much locked up at home in the north of the country. Hello?! This is Europe, plenty of americans travel here, and you report nothing?! Just wow!"

2020-02-22 20:05,"Perhaps it's time to put pressure on our Government Officials including Congress to get a clear and succinct picture as to what is happening in the US & Canada. What their plans are, how we are evaluating this virus, when we can depend upon test kits that are reliable. I watch the WHO pressers and they offer some of the best information available in addition to reliable individual scientists. They give me confidence w/o having to put on rose colored glasses, I ask that you not equate the CDC of yesterday to todays in-terms of leadership or even the CDC & WHO. It is sad we are living in a world where megalomaniacs are willing to hide numbers & info. even on state level so they can pretend markets will hold over a possible pandemic. When I say confidence I mean news and in knowing they are doing all that they can to quell this virus, it may or may not be enough. Keep healthy all and wish our sisters and brothers of the world strength."
2020-02-22 20:12,"I've been on 2 cruises in the last 40 years or so, none in the last 20 years, as the ships have gotten bigger with more passengers and crew.  During those 2 cruises, I've noted the unsanitary conditions, sometimes impossible to avoid on ships with the best intentions.  Every so often one hears of norovirus and legionnaires outbreaks.  These are the outbreaks the public hears about.  I wonder how many people get sick, but it never reaches the volume where it is made public.

It is almost unavoidable to have cross-contamination on a cruise ship, living in close quarters with 2000-4000 passengers.  Although the idea of a cruise is tempting, the risk is too great for me to even consider one again. A floating petri-dish is an apt description of the communal living conditions on a ship.  I bet you dollars to doughnuts there is a movie about this, probably embellished to make it more horrific.  It will be a box office hit."
2020-02-22 19:28,"Clear definition of state corporate crime where Japan/internal community and Princess Cruises were responsible for peoples safety and knowingly ignored industry standard protcols to protect people on board (and now offboard since they are disbursing). The 634  people infected from the cruise ship are victims of this system of greed, as are all the people those infected may infect. Things could have been done properly instead of creating massive infection among people in close quarters. Less restrictions allowed people to interact and spread the illness was a veiled attempt to keep the passengers more calm. Insane what they created by blatently ignoring health and safety protcols. Letting people just go after the weakest possinle 2 week quarantine in history is insane negligence boardering on criminal (if these things were codified). There should have been proper facilities created on the ground in the mean time to house these individuals. In the words of Trump: Sad."
2020-02-22 19:33,"How could the cruise ship not have a plan in place for an onboard contagion?  It's so totally foreseeable.  What good does it do to quarantine the passengers if infected crew is still circulating among all of them?  How could the State Department and Department of Health and Human Services not have a predetermined method for evacuating potentially infected citizens from foreign countries?  Again, a totally foreseeable situation.  The picture of that plastic sheet on the plane with six foot air gaps on either side is beyond ludicrous."
2020-02-22 19:33,A must-read article with several alarming details.  The takeaway is that BOTH Japan and USA govt-level health officials had no idea what they were doing and abandoned standard protocols.  It is just a matter of time for the virus to spread to the USA: its a given.  The question is whether or not USA hospitals can handle the stricken as it proliferates in our country.  The USA's decisions to put 14 known virus infected Americans on that charter plane with healthy people in re-circulated air (!) is completely nuts.   Not a good indication that the USA will do any better than Japanese health officials.
2020-02-22 19:40,"All the criticism and attacks on China's response to the COVID-19 outbreak, yet now the Chinese look absolutely professional in comparison to the criminal ineptitude of the Japanese and American authorities. Two of the mightiest powers on Earth can't handle miniscule viral situations on a ship. We can only imagine the catastrophic ineptitude when the outbreak becomes a true pandemic.  My heart goes out to the people of Iran. They already face severe shortages of medicine caused by US sanctions, there are simply no resources to fight this Coronavirus outbreak. Undoubtedly, the US is delighted at this catastrophe, and will do nothing to provide humanitarian assistance."
2020-02-22 19:44,"And when will anyone please spell out best practices for those of us WITH the dreaded “underlying conditions”? I’ve scoured news on Coronavirus from three different papers since mid-January; never once have I seen mention of how asthmatics ought to approach this disease. And for those with more profound “underlying conditions” - immune suppression, chemotherapy - there is quite literally no guidance at all. Should we with underlying conditions be taking more precautions, like wearing masks and avoiding recent travelers? It seems likely, though no one in authority will say."
2020-02-22 19:46,"That room Ms Gay Courter is isolated in is luxurious on a typical cruise ship. The crew and staff (including entertainment) live in small cramped rooms, sometimes three at a time.

2020-02-22 19:57,"Princess Cruises should be sued until its lights go out. It is no news that cruise ships are dangerous infection factories and ecological time bombs. What is becoming appallingly clear, though not surprising, is the reckless lack of professionalism this outfit has exhibited in dealing with this crisis. No need to repeat all the failings in the ship’s hygienic and health protocols that have been uncovered and detailed in this article. The way this emergency has been handled by the ship crew is simply beyond shame. These cruise ships should be immobilized until such time that they can demonstrate, through an independent, encompassing and strict audit, that they meet minimal hygienic, health (and ecological!) standards commensurate with today’s scientific and operational best practices."
2020-02-22 20:06,"When it comes to medicine, it is best to listen to doctors rather than bureaucrats or politicians.  Apparently that is a point of confusion for many people."
2020-02-22 20:12,"Most unconscionable decisions: 

-Allowing the 14 infected passengers to board the planes.
-Allowing the ~1,000 passengers to walk off the boat after exactly 14 days.

It's only a matter of luck if the US and Japanese governments get away with these decisions. 

Of course, if any deaths result and the families try to sue, in the US they'll be faced with defenses of governmental immunity."
2020-02-22 20:12,"My wife and I have canceled a Baltic cruise for this June because: 

1. Most cruise lines reserve the right to alter or curtail the schedule and itinerary without refunds; and cancel-for-any reason insurance will add about half the cost of the cruise. 

2. We are both over 70 and thus at higher risk of becoming seriously ill or even dying from COVID-19 if we catch it. 

3. In the best of times cruise ships are floating Petri dishes that easily spread noroviruses; note the current COVID-19 transmissions on the Diamond Princess. 

4. While our cruise ports are in countries that now have fewer than 25 cases, the coronavirus could become a pandemic affecting thousands in many countries, including those on our itinerary. Our nightmare scenario is that we or other passengers contract the disease aboard or ashore. Do we want to be treated or quarantined on the ship or in Latvia or Estonia or Russia or Finland or Denmark? No way. 

For us the medical/financial risks are just too great, so for 2020 we are planning to limit our travel to US destinations we can reach easily by car or short flights. 

Over time we will evaluate the coronavirus situation and see how cruise lines and foreign countries are coping. There’s always next year. 

My comments are not medical advice, which readers should seek from their doctors. For travel advice, talk to your travel agent, carrier and insurance agent."
2020-02-22 20:29,"The 14-day quarantine on board the ship never made the slightest bit of sense. It's based on the assumption that everyone was exposed and started incubating the disease on Day 1. 

What about the hundreds of people who, for whatever reason, managed to avoid exposure until Day 6 or 9 -- or even Day 14? Even if the quarantine measures had been far more effective than they actually were, the assumption should've been continuous, rolling exposures. 

Even assuming the 14-day maximum incubation period is correct (and we've already seen cases proving that it's not), first you'd need to remove each individual from any possibility of exposure -- strict quarantine *off* the ship. Then impose an adequate quarantine. 

We also need to hear from the CDC and NIH on the true incubation period."
2020-02-22 20:33,"Ships do not carry adequate medical personnel or ward space. If an employee falls ill, they are removed from the ship, if anything. Being a doctor on a cruise ship is considered a lowly position, perhaps only taken near retirement. Unless health care is taken seriously by cruise lines, these outbreaks will just continue to happen, whether norovirus or coronavirus or something else."
2020-02-22 20:50,"How this virus is transmitted is vital, airborne, contact or ingestion? Or all of them? How long will the virus survive outside a host? Since animals can be infected, can they transmit the virus to humans? These would be the minimum questions the ships owners should have asked.  Ships have closed ventilation systems and are connected throughout the ship. Room air ventilation is interconnected.  The ships personnel living in close quarters certainly raises alarms as well as the galley’s that prepare the food. Temperatures are ideal for virus’s to live in a hot humid atmosphere, both place's are that.  Bringing things to the passenger rooms by a crew member or anyone would break that area of being sterile. If you wash your hands and then take something from an outside source you are contaminated from that source.  People touch their face at least 50 - 100 times a day. 

Was there any detective work done to try and find if infected people were from a certain area of the ship? Had specific food, goods or things given to them by the same personnel?

You show a photo of Mr. Molesky getting tested for the virus. Did the person giving the test change his protective gear for every person being tested.  Yes, it might protect him, but does its surfaces carry a virus to another recipient?

It is evident the longer one stayed aboard that ship the chance of not getting the virus dropped dramatically.  From your article it is apparent that a preventative protocol was not established."
2020-02-22 18:21,I wonder what the ship’s Doctor was doing other than dining with the Captain and enjoying the entertainment?
2020-02-22 20:28,"My to do list this weekend:

-Costco run to store some food, basics and disinfecting goods. CDC says have 2 weeks stored for any pandemic not just now. 

-Call friends from Mexico to mail N95 masks or bring me some on their trips back.

-Cancel spring break in Italy/France

- Refill kids asthma/allergy meds


Overreacting much you say? Better be safe than sorry."
2020-02-22 20:26,The craziest part of this is the way they quarantined the paying passengers but treated the crew as if they were a different species that couldn't be infected by the virus or pass it around to others. Some serious status-based magical thinking.

2020-02-22 20:20,"This virus probably originated in wildlife which was caught for human consumption. So we rightly believe that everyone who eats wildlife has contributed to the emergence of this disease. Similarly as this virus is being spread worldwide through international recreational travel, everyone who travels for pleasure is directly contributing to the spread of this disease. Stay in your own home and don't get on any cruise ships or airplanes. You will not die if you don't go on a holiday this year."
2020-02-22 20:32,You don't have to be a scientist nor a doctor to understand that the worst place to be healthy is in a confined environment with sick people like a hospital or a cruise ship. While a hospital is full of health professionals with tests and treatments a cruise is not.
2020-02-22 20:33,"“no current evidence to suggest that the virus spreads between rooms on a ship through the air-handling system.”

Someone should go back to whomever said this and ask why labs, right in their research facility handling pathogens, have dedicated, isolated HVAC systems complete with airlocks.  The bubble of contagion around an infected person is measured in essentially static air, not forced air."

2020-02-22 21:34,"I have been reading everything I can about the coronavirus epidemic to help me decide whether to cancel a cruise to the Baltic this summer.

In my varied searches I have found that the NYT's maps and and graphs and statistics related to the coronavirus epidemic are frequently out of date.

The most current and authoritative maps and stats I have been able to find are provided by Johns Hopkins University at <a href=""https://gisanddata.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6"" target=""_blank"">https://gisanddata.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6</a>

For example, another NYT article minutes ago reported that Italy has 40-some coronavirus cases. However, the Johns Hopkins site reports  62 Italian cases, by far the most in a European country, thus identifying a recent and huge upward spike that has caused authorities to quarantine 10 or 11 small towns in northern Italy.

I hope all news channels and departments will use old-fashioned foot-work to find and convey the most accurate and up-to-date information about the coronavirus epidemic.

By the way, based on information provided by Johns Hopkins and other authoritative sources I have decided to cancel my summer cruise to the Baltic nations--perhaps next year."
2020-02-22 21:36,"Obviously even the most developed nations are still not prepared for this. What did they do the last two months, praying for clouds of disinfectant raining over China?
I also didn't hear or read anything about cities in Germany preparing for the impact of Covid-19, like stacking up medical supplies and logistics. My brother works in a lab related to health, he told me, all the whole staff is expecting a bad hit in the next months and they know, that until now there hasn't been any kind of preparation.
I am guessing, this will be a slow and steady burner and I am expecting some kind of summer of Corona here in Europe. The idea of wearing a mask in what probably will be ""the hottest and longest summer ever measured"" once again isn't very seductive.
With bad luck, the virus stays for years, will come in waves or will endlessly shred it's way through our countries and the (so   far) relative low death rat isn't a relief: 20% of all cases are severe or critical, which would be 16 million people in Germany. I don't see, how the health system can deal with this, especially after all the cuts of the last decades."
2020-02-22 20:29,"It is remarkable how many geniuses make comments here.  Every disaster is foreseeable.  Sue the cruise line and health departments, then jail them.  I go on a lot of cruises.  Last October I cruised the China coast (Viking).  Went to the ships doctor with gastric issues.  I was advised there would be no charge, but now I had to stay in my cabin until cleared.  If I didn't, they would discharge me at the nearest port.  After a couple a days I said I felt fine (not really) and was allowed to leave.  No epidemic.  A cruise ship can only do so much even when the problem is known.  This is/was an unknown.  Modern medicine is not full proof when it comes to new diseases.  Look at AIDS."
2020-02-22 21:03,"Petri dish is an apt label for this ship.  The implications of how irresponsibly passengers were encouraged to intermingle before the quarantine was imposed, keeping them onboard while they were quarantined, and multiple other failures to try to stop the virus from spreading has no doubt had,  and will continue to have, an impact on the health of the entire world.  Shame on everyone involved in this entire disaster."
2020-02-22 21:04,"Some of the comments on here are ridiculous. I've been on 80+ cruises and caught a cold twice. Like any crowded area, Disney? you have to be aware of keeping your hands clean. You would be shocked at the number of ppl who don't bother. The last ship I was on this Jan. had a person at the entrance to every dining venue with a Purel dispenser. Everyone got a handful. This is common on cruise ships. If a norovirus outbreak happens, the affected are confined to their rooms and special procedures are dictated as to cleaning their cabins and handling their food service. However, this was a unique episode. I think the Japanese medical personnel who took over mishandled the situation. When the number of cases rose every day, it was obvious something else had to be done. Evacuating the ship when you are dealing with 5000 passengers and crew that need to be quarantined presents quite a problem. The governments of the passengers finally evacuated their own citizens. The Trump administration fired the government’s entire pandemic response chain of command in 2018. The CDC, NSC, DHS, and HHS all had their budgets cut in the billions. That infrastructure is gone as are the personnel.  So let's hope the Covid 19 can be contained in the US now."
2020-02-22 21:08,"Japan seems from this account to have handled the problem like a dysfunctional emerging economy.

Maybe the suspicion of outsiders that kept any foreigners from entering the country for two centuries until Commodore Perry showed up explains part of this?"
2020-02-22 21:17,"This article is an important learning tool. It makes one wonder how any passengers and crew members on the Diamond Princess managed to come away *without* being infected with the coronavirus.   So many instances of needless, repeated exposure; the well soon became the sick.  The vision of hindsight is always perfect: the top down management of an infectious disease expert was critical."
2020-02-22 21:20,"Let’s just say, it’s confounding when a virus with unknown potential starts spreading. It appears mild, but spreads far too quickly, leaves children alone, affects men more than women. The elderly react quite severely. It’s a traveller making it’s way around the world at an alarming speed. It is the unknowns about this virus with rather vicious cousins that is scaring the medical community. What if you label it as harmless and it is unstable enough to spawn a terrible illness? I wish the medical community would connect and get common preventive practices for medical communities the world around. Maybe posters to stick in many, places with sketchy medical care. And of course place these where bureaucrats decide to mingle with possibly infected people.  How about the CDC writing for the American citizens in the newspapers?"
2020-02-22 21:21,"China’s government not only started this pandemic, it compounded its lethality by ignoring then deflecting blame to a wet market that sells (allegedly) illegal bushmeat. It does not admit that the virus leaked from one of its government labs.  But then this.

Last week, Wu Yuanbin, director at the Chinese Ministry of Science and Technology, wrote in an official press release, that “China should enhance its management of viruses and bio agents at all labs and research institutes. The competent authorities also emphasized the need to strengthen the management of laboratories, especially viruses, to ensure biosecurity.”

In April 2004 the SARS virus escaped a BSL3 lab in Beijing at least three times.  That led to doubts about the safety of Chinese virus labs.  China had been correctly accused of secrecy and mendacity in the 2002 SARS outbreak, leading to more deaths.  The new 2004 outbreak of SARS in Beijing was the fault of a series of flaws at the CDC's National Institute of Virology.  World scientists wanted details about these new 2004 SARS infections and how the virus escaped the lab.  More secrecy.

2020 -  Why hasn’t China allowed independent investigators to access the Wuhan Institute of Virology BSL4 labs?  Investigators could then rule out or implicate the lab as being the source.  The government-run lab handled strains of the coronaviruses. One could have escaped and infected patient zero.  That makes the PRC culpable."

Cruise ship company(carnival cruise) who chose not to cancel these trips for fear of hurting their bottom lines.
Passengers who failed to take the situation seriously after learning of an infected person was onboard. They dined, danced, ate, attended group activities, share utensils etc.
Cruise directors who failed to take the situation seriously and ill prepared to manage a potential outbreak.  
The ship crew had to tend to passengers while sick.  They could not isolate themselves from each other and had to continue working.
Carnival Cruise failed to prepare and plan for a catastrophe on their ship.

The mission of the UN is of course primarily to maintain international peace, prevent war. I have come to believe the UN set itself up for failure when it attempted to prevent all war and that it ought have more often embraced enforcing the rules of war.
Be that as it may, it is in fact the organizations of the UN that keep it as a most valuable institution but that it does need to take more robust actions in situations such as this because they are international in scope.  The WHO ought be at the least the leading authority on how such an epidemic is to be handled.

The Japanese couple who were quarantined after returning from Hawaii seem to have picked up the disease in Hawaii where there was no Wuhan connection.

This would include provisions for adequate quarantine facilities and the speedy dispatching of requisite medical supplies and trained medical staff to ground zero locations anywhere in the world. The piecemeal, go-it-alone, make-it-up-as-you-go-along approach is both selfish and bankrupt.

Leaving it the captain of a cruise ship to come up with an appropraite response in the instance of the Diamond Princess was foolish in the extreme and the consequences bear that out. Don't blame the captain. Blame the heads of state globally who should have known better and made the necessary preparations. Mankind has a long track record on this type of thing stretching all the way black to the Black Plague. The Spanish Flu epidemic? HIV? Ebola? Hello.

That's what good government means - coordinating necessary actions that isolated individuals are incapable of undertaking on their own.

I personally would like to hear what every presidential hopeful and/or candidate has to say on this pressing topic appropriate."

2020-02-22 18:08,"The sound you hear is the plaintiff bar sharpening their boning knives.  China will be sued for hundreds of billions of US$.  The Party is creating a false narrative.  We already know that China was negligent in delays that could have saved lives and livelihoods worldwide.  It has not learned from its past epidemics.  China’s secrecy killed people.  We get glimpses of what might be true.

Last week, Wu Yuanbin, director at the Chinese Ministry of Science and Technology, wrote in an official press release, that “China should enhance its management of viruses and bio agents at all labs and research institutes. The competent authorities also emphasized the need to strengthen the management of laboratories, especially viruses, to ensure biosecurity.”

In April 2004 the SARS virus escaped a BSL3 lab in Beijing at least three times.  That led to doubts about the safety of Chinese virus labs.  China had been correctly accused of secrecy and mendacity in the 2002 SARS outbreak, leading to more deaths.  The new 2004 outbreak of SARS in Beijing was the fault of a series of flaws at the CDC's National Institute of Virology.  World scientists wanted details about these new 2004 SARS infections and how the virus escaped the lab.  More secrecy.

2020 -  Why hasn’t China allowed independent investigators to access the Wuhan Institute of Virology BSL4 labs?  One guess.  It has been destroying evidence.  Sanitizing to escape accountability at home and abroad."

Several different agars with a whole repertoire of nutrients are used. Having researched viruses for half my life, I don't remember ever growing viruses in a petri dish by supplying nutrients.

Viruses are obligate intracellular parasites. In simple English, viruses cannot multiply in a Petri dish with nutrients. Human and mamalian Viruses like HIV, Corona viruses, Influenza viruses only multiply inside an infected person  or eucarytoc cells in culture if at all. Viruses are nano meter sized and can only be visualized by electron microscope. Viruses cannt be treated with antibiotics and require specific antivirals. 

Beyond China, not too many other countries were prepared to impose quarantine and stop persons from China entering their borders or flying in or cruising into their countries. It is unfortunate that Japan let passengers from Coronavirius ravaged China to enter a large cruise ship. It is no use crying over delay and other missteps.

* The American college student who skipped being checked and went straight to a fast food restaurant in one of the busiest airports in the world
 * A woman told she had to be quarantined who decided her move across the country took precedence
*The defective test kits
* The people, inexplicably tested, but released *before* the results came in (?!!), results that showed dozens were infected
*Moving the infected from ships to busy ports, to even busier cities.

Imagine each of those incidents as the classic red-dot contagion-contact maps, the ones where the one you touch touches ten, who touch ten,who touch ten, and so on. The young man alone could have set off a chain reaction that would have infected hundreds if he had been sick. Having skipped being tested, it was just dumb luck that he wasn't.

When the big one hits, one akin to the 1918 flu, we've just demonstrated that we're in trouble. Turns out you cannot take the human out of being human. The Darwinian needs to flee or preserve the self will, ironically, be what dooms.

Certainly many were since they had been operating normally with an infected person on board for a number of weeks.  That person got off in Hong Kong, where did he get on (typically 2 weeks before Hong Kong but could be more)?  That's a lot of exposure on a cruise ship.  And between this person getting on the ship and Yokohama, many people could have been infected, and symptomatic, but thought they just had a sore throat or cold or what not so they just kept doing what you do on a cruise ship and no quarantine is going to make all these infected people better.  We don't really know how many would have been infected even if the quarantine had been perfect, so how can we say that the virus ran rampant after it got to Yokohama.  Certainly it might have, and the fact that people on-shore got the virus indicates that procedures were far from perfect, but when you say ""rampant"", I think you should have some actual facts."

What is 2% anyway.? Doesn't seem like much. Simple experiment; take your extended family and assume that everyone becomes infected with Corona virus. For me, that would be about 44 people, including infants. 

Now load a hypothetical 50-chamber revolver with just one round of ammunition and then one at a time, spin the cylinder, hold the gun to each family member's head and squeeze the trigger. (44 times for me) 2% of the time the gun will go off. Even if morbidity rate was only 1%? Now you're using a 100 chamber pistol. Still sounds pretty bad to me.

Some people believe that rules don't apply to them, others won't be honest about the onset of their illness.... and then there's about lack of transparency by totalitarian nations... and about a lack of resources in poorer nations. IMO, it's a foregone conclusion that the Corona virus gets worse before it gets better.

The cruise ships are a Petri dish for more than just the virus. They are illustrating the current differences in how the nation states are willing to work with each other and in some cases, their abilities to accept science based facts in a timely manner.

2020-02-23 5:43,"My master’s degree dealt with social history and viruses, which led me to read a lot about contagion. It also made me painfully aware of how poorly trained to reduce contagion medical staff is. I once had to call an ambulance for a case of suspected meningitis in my daughter. This happened in Switzerland, where the staff is usually from a variety of countries. First, the person who assessed my daughter did not wear proper protection - there were clear neurological signs and I had been very clear on the phone. Then, the ambulance was not disinfected (I asked). Finally, when I told the nurse she was not wearing gloves, and had spilled some blood on her hands while putting in the I.V., she shrugged, told me it happened all the time and I had to explain to her I didn’t mean to tell her how to do her job  but it was a suspected meningitis. Normally, due to the seriousness of meningitis - and it was indeed an inflammation of the meninges, due thankfully to a rotavirus so limited - there is a very strict protocol. When your young child does not recognize you and you still are the only one in the room who thinks about safety procedures, it’s very worrying. And when you think it happened in Switzerland, a very advanced and well-organized country, mere miles away from the headquarters of the World Health Organization, you worry even more. Antibiotics and perhaps even vaccines have made people complacent. Old times dragon-like head nurses may be just what the doctor needs."

Or even with our annual flu epidemic.  Thousands died from the flu last year in the US last year and hundreds of thousands were hospitalized.  Even an outbreak of regular flu on a cruise ship would infect many of the passengers and crew and, as the article says, the passengers tend to be older and some would probably die.

There's nothing particularly new from a scientific point of view here. The SARS virus was not that different in terms of the risks it posed and the quarantine measures that should have been used to handle it. There was the opportunity there for the WHO to learn what needed to be done. They had plenty of budget to build up the necessary (very large) stockpile of masks, goggles and suits. They also had the budget to have teams ready and trained to fly out to help the port and ship authorities where necessary.

The science is not the problem and the budget was not the problem. The problem must be the people within the WHO. When the dust has settled there needs to be a huge clearout of dead wood. You have to suspect that the organisation has become packed with people who've been given jobs as favours for one reason or another. The organisation needs to be renewed and restaffed top to bottom and its future accountability ensured."
2020-02-23 12:41,"From the excellent reporting detail, I see a bunch of authorities at all levels making their best judgement calls under evolving circumstances.  It appears even “the experts” don’t agree with what should have been done, and that with perfect view of hindsight!  I would be like the nurse who eventually threw her hands up and decided that since she’d already been exposed, why bother with a mask and just plow ahead trying to do her best to help others."
2020-02-23 13:02,"Two underlying issues.  One is who controls the passengers of this  type of ships.  The owner is a US company, the flag used is that of the UK. In normal circumstances, the ship must obey British jurisdiction.  This article should have looked at this dimension before unreservedly criticising the Japanese government’s early response.

Another issue is the role of WHO.  The DG of WHO, who already had a very questionable track record of maximally excluding Taiwan from WHO activities and cutting off information from to Taiwan, chose to play down the risk before the ship started having the problem.  This DG did not allow downside risks essentially by fully accepting China’s official line in the early stage of WHO response.  The ship’s management and subsequently the Japanese government went along with this attitude."
2020-02-23 13:30,"I hope that while in quarantine, people are given the opportunity to gain access to certain foods and herbs that help to strengthen the immune system- not to cure but to strengthen in case they eventually test positive.  I am thinking elderberry syrup which has been used in Europe for a long time for example.  Increasing water intake also before getting sick.  Taking extra vitamin C... Simple measures along with hand washing etc."
2020-02-23 13:30,"Granted, I’ve never understood the appeal of cruise ships, largely thanks to the ecological irresponsibility and damage-by-mass tourism that follow in their wake. But the risk of contagion on these hulks terrifies me, even in the case of illnesses associated with them- Legionnaires and Norwalk, predominantly. The possibility of this perfect storm of a newly discovered virus, incubating throughout an environment packed with people, no sensible quarantine practices and no chance of escape? My god, it’s basically a horror film. And people pay for this."
2020-02-23 13:49,I find it baffling that many Americans demand draconian containment measures yet oppose government-funded disease prevention programs and universal health care coverage.  Makes no sense to me.
2020-02-23 14:14,"It is surprising that the ship and its operator were so ill-prepared for any type of highly contagious diseases. Given frequent norovirus outbreaks on cruise ships, I would have thought that they have implemented standard procedures to deal with an infectious disease, whether or not it's is novel. Clearly, the operator failed to minimize the spread of the virus at early crucial phases. Why didn't they implement the lockdown on their own decision? Why did they not anticipate and prepare for an outbreak? It's easy to blame the Japanese government, but that does not prevent future outbreaks."
2020-02-23 14:44,"Every single decision made at every single point in this whole outbreak has been made in the worst way possible. Putting people on a plane, after learning they are infected, with people who were not infected? Couldn't find another plane anywhere? Pandemic is coming."
2020-02-23 15:08,"This whole virus started with one patient.  No one has tests that are 100% accurate, so inevitably some will escape detection and infect. the incubation period also varies so quarantine is not 100% effective.

This all started with one patient. And each day more patients are slipping through. Every single one of them capable of recreating tens of thousands of cases.

Our goal here in the USA and other countries will be to slow the virus - because it can not be stopped. I can assure you planning is taking place behind closed doors about social distancing, our economy, financial markets and other concerns. 

Rest assured we've the wrong administration in power to handle this crisis. On the bright side, Trump may not get his rallies."
2020-02-23 12:02,Maybe now the Trump administration and its enablers will begin to believe in science.
2020-02-23 2:49,"For days the NYT reporting on COVID-19 focused on the perceived mishandling by the Chinese government and communist party. 

For the last month, hundreds of millions of people across China imposed self quarantine at home, following Chinese Public Heath Doctors advice. Residents who have had contacts with the infected, or live in the epicentre faced mandatory quarantine of 14 days (groceries and other necessities were brought to them during this time).

During this time, the Chinese New Year holiday, when it’s typically the busiest season for hospitality and many are travelling to visit their families, most economical and commercial activities in China stopped. Some companies already went bankrupt, many are predicting a steep decline in revenue. Everyone in China has been impacted deeply. 

But the people, despite these challenges, focused on preventing the virus spread by staying at home, donating money and supplies, volunteering at their local communities. 

35,000 medical practitioners traveled to Wuhan to help, 14,000 isolation beds were built in a matter of weeks, with 30,000 more to come. 

Dozens of officials have been fired, Wuhan’s mayor was replaced by the Mayor of Shanghai. 

During all this, NYT reporting focused on the initial ‘cover up’ by the local government, how people’s movements were restricted, on how difficult it is to get supplies, test kits, groceries, etc etc. 

The vitriol towards the Chinese government in the comments section was palpable. 


Now?"

2020-02-23 14:42,"There were many mistakes made by many people in this slowly unfolding disaster. The biggest mistake and the biggest lesson to be learned is that travel restrictions that lead into quarantines work. 
But they only work if every country is on board. When the United States put a travel ban on any plane coming from China and a 14 day quarantine on anybody airlifted from China every other country that has flights to the United States should have done the same thing on the same day at the same time. That is the only way to contain an epidemic.
  Nothing stopped people from China who have relatives in America from simply getting around the ban by flying to a country with no ban like Japan then flying to the United States . This whole thing could have been nipped in the bud 3 weeks ago.
  Trump should have put the travel ban in place and then told every country to do the same and banned flights from countries with no travel bans . 
  That would have stopped the spread very quickly."

First of all, don't yuk someone else's yum. Obviously you must do activities that others would prefer not to do. And secondly, have some compassion for these people. They thought they were going on a vacation and ended up in a nightmare. 

The point of this story is the incredibly ill-prepared and ill-conceived handling of the situation by the cruise line and the governments. It almost reads like a case study in what not to do when there is a viral outbreak in a confined environment."
2020-02-23 10:25,"Lessons are not being learned and applied to other real-world cases. 

For instance, mid-terms are coming up and college students are getting sick, remaining in dorms and sticking it out. Being sick is not an excuse. 

In my middle school, one teacher was laid up with the “worst flu” he had ever experienced. He went to urgent care this past Monday. They didn’t test him but told him he would be fine. He was back in school Wednesday, looking like death-on-wheels. High-stakes testing is coming up!  Being sick is not an excuse. 

If it’s here, it’s time to shut it down. Schools will still be here in the fall. Local leaders need to lead."

The only question they are asked is ‘have you been in China in the last 15 days’ and relies on answers based on trust. 
What if some of these have been in Vietnam or Iran in the past 15 days? I have a gut sense that we are at a stage where this spread is uncontrolled and every nation has to prepare for the epidemic!"
2020-02-23 13:45,"What is not being emphasized is the data from this ""Petri dish"" experiment.  One major point is the rate of spread  of the virus.  Most importantly is the mortality rate of the virus.   The mortality rate is best viewed as the number who have died from the virus divided by the number who have survived the virus and are now virus free.  All those with active disease are still at risk to die.   This will be a sample of disease outside of Wuhan.  And it seems as medical care was not great as people were left in their cabin for days with temps of 104 degrees.   I project two results.  Wuhan will have death rate of about 3 to 4% when all is done, and these  cruise passengers will end with about 10 deaths for 1000 cleared infections, or about 1%.  Then the logical question will be why the huge differential ( a multiple of 3 or 4) ?"
2020-02-23 8:47,"Japanese government officials' actions regarding the Diamond Princess have evidently resulted in more people becoming infected and sickened by the new deadly coronavirus.
Since a certain percentage are likely to die as a result, this is grim news of entirely preventable deaths. Let's hope for the best.
While the top government officials deserve the appropriate penalties, unfortunately, their legal system is incapable of doing that. This goes to the illegitimacy of the Japanese government."
2020-02-23 11:07,"When passengers finally began to be evacuated from the ship, the article states: ""Experts have questioned whether those passengers truly pose no risk to the general public. Some could develop symptoms later after having tested negative.""

The use of the term EXPERTS is laughable. Any fool would have concluded the same."
2020-02-23 6:29,"Really? “Ravaged”?  

Enough with the hyperbolic language, already!  It might have ruined some vacations, but the results seem not more dire than If the flu had stowed away onboard (which would likely have extracted a greater toll on a ship filled with seniors).  

More measured and objective wording is desperately needed in the media."

2020-02-23 10:23,"I live in Tokyo and seeing and reading the daily reports it was obvious to me - an untrained person - that the Japanese Health Ministry didn't do the right thing from the start. Why not get input from the WHO, The Center for Disease Control and others instead of doing things on their own hoping for the best.
Now the fear is it's traveling around very populated areas and with the Olympics on their way, why mess around. It makes no sense...truly lost in translation..."
2020-02-23 3:29,"Sadly, this article describes the very definition of incompetence.  The medical crew on board had no clue about exposure control, the Japanese medical officers provided no relevant instructions or enforcement on/of containment protocols. When Americans tried to involve the CDC the official that responded ignored prior knowledge of disease spread in confined high density living quarters.  The crew was housed in high density ‘barracks’ like conditions.  The NIH, CDC, Walter Reed Army Hospital and universities in the US know all too well these conditions can make a mildly infectious disease spread through the confined population quickly.   Sick crew members were commingled with healthy crew in four to a room bunks.   These crew members prepared and dispensed food.  The air handling system aboard ship is a semi-closed system with limited exchange for fresh air.  The obvious happened."

2020-02-23 14:22,"It baffles me as to why it was a good idea quarrantine 1000+ passengers on a cruise ship with those infected with the contagious coronavirus. It doesn't take a genius to predict a poor outcome for the passengers. Would evacuating the ship in a controlled manner have been more prudent? IDK, I'm not a genius."

Think of what we spend on military...now think of what devastation microbes can do.  Micro invaders can be worse than macro invaders.  The US wouldn't have so many Europeans without the diseases they/we brought that the indigenous people had no immunity to.

People are contagious before they know they are sick.   To control it, everyone who has been exposed needs to be quarantined and tested.   Are we putting all of our efforts to manufacture testing kits, set up more facilities to perform those tests?  Are we preparing the necessary manufacture and distribution of protective gear?
Does the virus respond to the current anti virals?"
2020-02-23 13:48,"There are 150 remaining ship passengers quarantined at Travis Air Force base in California. Their test results should be available starting on Sunday morning. The prediction is that 15% of them will test positive for the coronavirus. The plan is to disperse the positive patients, even if they have no symptoms, to local Northern California hospitals. The physician leadership at Northern California’s largest HMO received an email on Saturday stating that all hospitals in their system should expect to start admitting patients as early as Sunday. This ill-conceived plan will unnecessarily expose sick hospitalized patients and hospital staff - who have had no training with isolation equipment as of Sunday morning. A pandemic will surely ensue if the logistics continue to be left in the hands of administrators with little clinical experience and zero risk of exposure to themselves or their families."

2020-02-23 5:41,"Two thoughts: the Japanese government, like the Chinese with Li Wenliang, and probably most other governments and hierarchies, seemed to care more about censoring Kentaro Iwata and chain of command than protecting both those who are ill and those who are not. 

The floating cities that are modern cruise ships (and keep getting larger) are indeed a petri dish.  We already knew this with noroviruses. Between the huge number of passengers, the limited space and resources, the staff necessary to feed and cater to them all, it is no surprise that isolation is practically impossible, and contagion inevitable. Moreover, they make stops, spreading it in a less constrained way than flying.  My mom recently went on one (thankfully no disease outbreak) and said it was basically a vacation eating and sleeping on board.
It might be time to rethink these types of transports."
2020-02-23 16:01,"The Japanese Ministry of Health has been criminally incompetent for decades, and no Prime Minister has been willing to clean house. The Health Ministry did not approve the sale of low dose birth control pills until 1999, forcing women to endanger their health for decades after low dose pills were available elsewhere. For many years, the Ministry prevented the sale of anti-osteoporosis medications, claiming (preposterously) that Japanese women don't get osteoporosis. The Ministry refused to allow the US Navy to deliver life saving medications to refugees from the 2011 tsunami, claiming (again preposterously) that American manufactures might formulate the medications differently than Japanese manufacturers. And then of course there were the thousands of hemophiliacs who contracted HIV in the 1980s because the Health Ministry did not require heat treatment of blood products despite knowing that such treatment would kill the virus.

2020-02-23 15:58,"I really don't think the spread of viral disease on cruise ships is much of a mystery.  They have impoverished class workers in both food preparation and serving, and housecleaning.

First of all, if these employees are sick, at most they take one day off, and if they aren't very sick, they don't call in sick.  (Eight enforced sick days a year don't fix that problem since it takes eight days to get over a single cold.)   Do you know how often I've gotten stomach flu after eating at McDonalds (which I don't do very often).   Many of these people don't even wash their hands.   And often all they have to do is breathe or cough on the food.

It appears that most people with corona virus don't know they have it or aren't sick enough to see the doctor, the symptoms are often identical to other colds and the flu.

Second, now, I've done hotel housekeeping, and janitorial work.  First, the disinfectants commonly used don't kill many of these viruses.  Second, workers are never given enough rags and routinely use them to clean more than one guest room and more than one public bathroom.  

Best way to avoid illness on a cruise ship, don't let housekeeping in your room, followed by bring your own food.

I honestly think it's a very silly and spoiled kind of person with way too much money to waste that goes on a cruise ship to begin with.  Hard to have much sympathy for someone who would do that.  There are far better and more entertaining ways to spend money."

With all of this attention on a rogue virus, what if all of this sanitizing unleashes a rogue bacteria, immune to antibiotics? A MRSA on steroids? If you repeatedly sterilize vast swathes of the public areas in cities of millions, and the residents of those cities are sterilizing their homes daily, and slathering themselves with hand sanitizer, a lot of beneficial bacteria also dying, along with the harmful pathogens.

Gather the necessary, relevant data as quickly as possible. Analyze it appropriately. As quickly as possible. while protecting ALL of the sources, in as “sterile” an environment as is possible. Since boat staff are not infectious disease experts, the company can send the boats dimensions to CDC-WHO, and the Japanese experts to quickly determine how to minimize virus transmission. If necessary materials are not on the boat they are brought quickly. During this waiting period people are given information and other needed help designed to minimize stress, and the anxieties associated with uncertainties.

The first is that air-conditioned premises are a closed breathing circuit, with much recirculated air, whether it's in an office building, a cruise ship, or an airliner. In all places, the population is concentrated in a small space. I still remember returning from New Delhi via London on an Air India 747 in 2008. A number of passengers had flu-like symptoms, and everyone n our group came down with a bad flu on our return to New York, whether immediately or several days later.

Then think of McKinley Cantor's novel ""Andersonville,"" about a notorious Confederate prison camp in which 15,000 out of 45,000 Union prisoners died. It was an early instance of what later became known as a concentration camp, where large quantities of prisoners were concentrated in a small space with inadequate sanitary facilities. (This is distinct from murder camps, such as Auschwitz, although the bad sanitation blurs the distinction.)

Then think of the GOP and ""religious right's"" attitude, expressed during the AIDS epidemic, that AIDS was ""God's judgment on gays.""

You could test negative and show no symptoms for weeks and still be a carrier. 

We also don't know how long the virus can survive on surfaces, and whether disinfectants are as effective as claimed.

Given these unknowns, the only truly effective means of halting transmission is a 60-day quarantine based on evidence of exposure to people or places that have been exposed. No exceptions. 

How many countries are going to follow such a policy? Singapore?"

Japanese Government could say no to Diamond Princess to come to any port in Japan but the owner of the ship was the one did not fulfill its responsibility.

While viruses need to be at least 99 percent similar to call them “the same,” it is the differences in particular that have led researchers to speculate that COVID-19 was manufactured by modifying RaTG13, Fang said.

A French research team that examined the gene sequence of COVID-19 has discovered that it has four more amino acids than other coronaviruses, adding that this makes its transmission easier. The findings have led some in the research community to speculate about whether China’s scientists intended to develop a virus more difficult to contain than SARS, he said. If that was their intent, they appeared to have succeeded, he added. Mutations of viruses that occur naturally only result in small, singular changes, he said, adding that one would not normally see a naturally mutated virus suddenly take on four amino acids.

When this virus passes through, the world will be likely something completely different than it was at the beginning of this year.

But for now, the NYT publishes 'stories"" like this one. or the one about the events in Nevada today. 

I have a feeling that today's news in the NYT will in November 2020 matter as little as the lunch menu of the Austrian Archduke published in the papers on the day he was shot in Sarajevo mattered in November 1914.

A cruise ship isn’t big enough and doesn’t have enough crew to activate safe quarantine measures for a highly contagious disease.

Japan should have evacuated the ship and quarantined everyone on shore, within two or three days after the docking.  This was a failure on Japan’s part.  The cruise ship’s parent company should have insisted on it.  

And the US Government should have stepped in earlier to protect its citizens."

Not only has Japan exposed its citizens, government workers and health personnel to the risks associated with contracting the corona virus, Japan has also incurred enormous expenses and economic hardship in doing so.   Imagine that the United States had been concerned enough for the crew and passengers, to graciously accept the Diamond Princess in New York or San Francisco.  I believe even the United States, with all of our resources, would have had extreme difficulty in administering to the thousands of passengers, who most likely had already been exposed to the virus prior to reaching Japan.

One hopes that Trump's obsession with protecting his image--and his authoritarian tendencies--have not totally penetrated the U.S. government.

The competent authorities also emphasized the need to strengthen the management of laboratories, especially viruses, to ensure biosecurity.”

In April 2004 the SARS virus escaped a BSL3 lab in Beijing at least three times.  That led to doubts about the safety of Chinese virus labs.  China had been correctly accused of secrecy and mendacity in the 2002 SARS outbreak, leading to more deaths.  The new 2004 outbreak of SARS in Beijing was the fault of a series of flaws at the CDC's National Institute of Virology.  World scientists wanted details about these new 2004 SARS infections and how the virus escaped the lab.  More secrecy.

2020 -  Why hasn’t China allowed independent investigators to access the Wuhan Institute of Virology BSL4 labs?  Investigators could then rule out or implicate the lab as being the source.  The lab handled strains of the coronaviruses. One could have escaped and infected patient zero.  More secrecy.

The Human race is always learning and every disaster has its own unintended blessings. Antibiotics came out of the needs of world war 2. Perhaps there are lessons that the Corona Virus has to teach, after all necessity is the mother of invention.

But one thing is clear there are many brilliant men and women in a race to stop this virus, "" so few doing so much for so many"".  Let us not forget that even as you read this, so many courageous men and women all over the world are on the front lines batting it in Hospitals, as ambulance drivers, in labs working on vaccines, soldiers, policemen , officials and of these some of the bravest have already fallen.

They are obviously hiding something, the question is if it's just their own incompetence or if there is some validity to some of the conspiracy theories that are popping up everywhere. Fact is as the virus spreads to other free nations, the nature of the virus may be better understood.

Therefore quarantine based on travel to any countries at risk is warranted - there is no point in checking temperatures at airports.
2020-02-21 14:06,"S. Korea is in close proximity to China and there is a lot of people to people exchange and trade between the 2 countries. Remember flying a short hop from Seoul to Dalian some 5 years ago. Crowded public places and secretive churches will be breeding grounds for the COVID-19 Corona. It seems there are more modes of transmission and spread of the highly contagious nano sized COVID-19. If possibilities of fecal oral transmission are suspected, cold foods like kim chi of various kinds and foods eaten cold could become a source of COVID transmission. Back to the basics proper masks, gowns, proper hand washing along with eating well cooked foods and boiled liquid foods for a while may become a measure to prevent spread. Back to disposable chop sticks or thoroughly washed utensils and bottled water. All possible thoughtful precautions will be productive. Avoiding crowded places for now will be helpful in containing the virus. Keep space between every individual who is not a family member. Show affection and respect in traditional Asian way with a bow from a distance. Panic will be unproductive.

China remains the epicenter and it will not be surprising that 100,000 infections will have occurred and up to 3000 deaths are possible before the end of March. A vaccine is on the horizon but will there be a rapid manufacture to supply all those taking care of patients and those exposed or most likely to be exposed? Wonder who is coordinating the battle against Corona virus COVID-19?"
2020-02-21 16:06,"Xi and his party are focused on maintaining the image of China. Even USA cannot match the resilience of Chinese Stock Market. Despite several weeks of deserted streets in major cities, the stock indexes are doing just fine - most likely thanks to the very deep pockets of the party. 

The question is how much of the similar efforts are going into arranging the chess board so that the reported number of new cases and deaths do not dent the image of the party's response to and the control over this virus."
2020-02-21 16:52,"We need to be thinking about the next virus, not the last one. Most annual flu epidemics start in China as well, where traditional agriculture and food marketing keeps humans in close proximity to multiple species of live animals, leading to mutations as viruses jump from one species to another.  China has the ability to change quickly. Agriculture and food handling must be brought up to international standards. 

Ironically vast imports of American pork were leading to a rapid decline in traditional agriculture until Trump's trade war. With a billion people cut off from pork, domestic small-farm production skyrockete and crowding of animals intensified, increasing the risk of viral mutation."
2020-02-21 16:20,"""Chinese officials in the province hardest hit by the coronavirus acknowledged for the first time on Friday that their methods of confirming and reporting infection numbers had sown confusion and mistrust.""
    Just last week China reported 13,332 additional cases due to a change in how authorities are counting them. Besides lab-confirmed tests, authorities also added CT scan diagnosed infections.
   ""Over the past week, the authorities in the province of Hubei, home to the city at the epicenter of the outbreak, Wuhan, have revised their case tallies three times because of shifting definitions "" 
    What is going on here? What is the role of the World Health Organization in reporting this epidemic? WHO has the mandate to lead and coordinate global surveillance  In addition, WHO ensures international coordination of epidemic response, particularly for diseases of international public health importance or when countries lack the capacity to respond to an epidemic themselves.
    Either China does not have the capacity or deliberately hiding the true number of cases, the WHO should step in."
2020-02-21 16:34,"A mortality rate of 2% for this virus compared to 0.2% for the Flu. Twenty times higher. Huh! So much for 'just the run of the mill fue like illness' often said earlier during this event.
Right?"
2020-02-21 16:42,"Too late. Pakistan for one did not close borders with China and refused to acknowledge or report cases, saying they had no ability to do so. People from their crowded cities travel throughout the Middle East on work crews every single week, returning home for family visits. The virus is probably loose everywhere there now. You can't close off the entire world. Prepare for a wave of cases coming across Europe and North America."
2020-02-21 17:06,"Covid-19 has exposed a problem we have: We live in a highly connected world in which a contagion can easily spread, yet we have no uniform way of dealing with it. Some countries ban flights from China, some don't; some countries repatriate their citizens from China, some don't; the different ways the two cruise ships in Japan and Cambodia were handled was rather striking; the policies for quarantine and isolation vary widely between countries; and poor countries are not likely to be well equipped to deal with an outbreak at all. 

And the real irony here is this lack of a consistent approach to dealing with Covid-19 may likely repeat itself within the US. Our CDC only has power at the borders of the states and the nation; within each state it is up to state officials how to deal with the virus. We are again likely to see a hodge-podge of quarantine, isolation, and hospitalization policies.

If China, with its tight central control, is struggling to contain the epidemic internally, what chance does the rest of the world, with its chaotic policies, have to prevent a pandemic?"
2020-02-21 17:06,"It seems to me that evacuations, even with a quarantine period built in, are pretty effective-- in bringing the disease around the world, not in preventing its spread. Is there something I'm missing here? I'm also concerned that quarantine is not evenly applied. As far as I know, travelers are still able to connect from China through other countries to the US, arrive without any look at their travel history, and can decide for themselves whether they wish to respect self-quarantine rules. Seems like a recipe for disaster."
2020-02-21 17:20,"Mortality rate should be calculated (Number Died)/(Number Recovered) = 20% and not (Number Died)/(Number Infected)  = 2%, because we really don't know how many infected are going to die. The SARS and Ebola mortality rates were calculated after the epidemic was over."
2020-02-21 17:24,"This is a very contagious virus to have infected so many people. Unfortunately China made the epidemic much worse by minimizing its severity when it was first discovered. They put politics before people.

The WHO or some other international agency has to design protocols for how countries should deal with an outbreak. The world needs to be proactive, not reactive, if we’re to contain viruses and prevent more epidemics and pandemics. 

The world needs strong, smart, forward-looking leadership. Where will it come from?"
2020-02-21 17:30,"It's comical to watch humans explain how they think they know how to control a situation like this.  As far as I'm concerned, we've seen enough to classify this situation as ""out of control"".  The chips are going to fall where they may.  Countries can try to hide reality.  China can use whatever fuzzy math it wants to count cases. The WHO can be involved or not be involved.  It doesn't matter.  A lot of chips are going to fall before this is over with.  Mother Nature wins every time."
2020-02-21 16:55,The Trump administration cut CDC funding and research development funding for viruses too but his wall is being built because we all know viruses won’t penetrate his gorgeous wall.
2020-02-21 16:54,"China manages its economy on the cheap for the benefit of the wealthy at the expense of its population with the most significant disparity of income and wealth in the world.

On the ongoing pandemic of Coronavirus, as will as the previous pandemics of SARS, etc., all of which originated in China, China’s unregulated livestock industry is a cesspool of dangerous viruses and bacteria. There are many reports of the outbreak of dangerous virus among animals, most recently pigs, in China which forces the culling of large herds of animals. This is why the West has a prohibition for the import of any animals, fowl, etc. from China. The science of the transfer of virus from animals to humans has been proved. There will be more pandemics originating from China as long as China’s livestock industry is unregulated.

I was listening to a epidemiologist on Canada’s CBC radio (a sister organization to the PBS) last week and he indicated that if the coronavirus reaches Africa or large developing countries in south Asia (India, Pakistan, etc.) or in the west Pacific (Indonesia, Philippines) then it can emerge and spread to be a global disaster … he added that this is because these countries do not have the infrastructure to deal with or control coronavirus.

There is the risk that if this scenario happens, then the coronavirus may have the impact of the 1918 influenza that killed more people than who died during WWI."
2020-02-21 17:37,The infectivity of this may preclude attempts at containment. It has clearly jumped international borders and there might not be a point in further isolation of China.  I think we have to brace for a true pandemic. We're all going to be exposed to it eventually.
2020-02-21 17:20,Forget global warming. Incurable pandemic is by far the greatest threat to human species. This one could be it.
2020-02-21 17:38,"And NOBODY is mentioning North Korea, which has a huge trade of goods and personnel with China. Is it not just a LITTLE suspicious that North Korea has not reported one single case? They're hiding something. Or many, many somethings."
2020-02-21 17:46,"""Iran acknowledged 18 cases in three cities, with four fatalities, and a surge in cases in South Korea was linked to a secretive church.""
    Frightening, Is this disease a pandemic? The COVID-19 epidemic in China has not yet met world health officials’ designation of a global pandemic that spreads far and wide throughout the world. While it has spread to more than two dozen countries, international health officials say there’s very little transmission on local levels outside of China right now.
   That is not true anymore, the COVID-19 epidemic has spread to more than 25 countries or more including Iran. Iranian authorities toady acknowledged that they have18 cases in three cities, with four deaths.
      This deadly virus is proving to be far more contagious than the seasonal flu and more contagious than the SARS. and the mortality rate is much higher than the seasonal flu
 ( mortality rate ofCOVID 19 is about 2%, seasonal flu less than 1%).
    COVID 19 is becoming a deadly pandemic. CDC has confirmed only 15 cases in the USA as of now but things can change and it is only question of time this virus can spread across the US and overwhelm our emergency rooms and hospitals"
2020-02-21 17:48,Economics is ruling the day.  Nations fear the broad economic impact to their national relation to the world.
2020-02-21 17:52,"It is clear, as the virus spreads, that countries are overly cautious, or even delusional, at admitting that the virus has entered their borders.

If Iran has 3 fatalities and 18 verified cases (17%), they simply haven't identified all the cases of infection.  Experts point out that it is premature to assign a number to the fatality rate this early in the spread of the epidemic.  Nevertheless, with a best guess of around 2.5% for worldwide fatality rate, there should be at least 40 infected people in Iran.  That is a small number, but it means the Iranians don't know who the other infected people are.  If they aren't putting superhuman efforts into tracking those infections down and quarantine them, the numbers will skyrocket."
2020-02-21 17:52,"What is the safe time period for continuous use of a face mask? After how many hours or days it becomes ineffective and may be risky? Also, what percent of breath generally bypasses the mask specially if somebody is coughing? 

To what extent common masks can prevent the movement of viruses. For comparison, only the most expensive high-end HVAC filters can block viruses. Rest of them are only good for visible particle matter."
2020-02-21 17:14,"Even 2 months into this and we seem to have more questions than answers.
Why have there been so few children infected?

How did it spread to Iran?

Why do the majority of people infected suffer no symptoms?

Are they contagious when they have no symptoms

Why did Dr. Li die when 90 percent of the fatalities are senior citizens with underlying medical conditions?

How could a country as modern and forward thinking as Japan make so many mistakes with the Diamond Princess?

2 months is a very long time, where are the answers?"
2020-02-21 13:48,"Production is slowly back in motion.  And the Coronavirus situation is seemingly improving and under control.  Those are  good signs.

However, the Chinese government still cannot find and identify the ""first"" patient of this Coronavirus disease, making it difficult to find the source and path of this fast spreading virus.  Local officials mis-managed the virus in the first place caused this headache for the medical researchers and Chinese CDC. 

On the other hand, this crisis also provides ample opportunities for frontier and new research that cooperation between China and many prominent institutions around the world are ongoing.  New medicine are in various testing stages. It will help pharmaceutical industry to better handle unexpected virus attack in the future."
2020-02-21 17:57,It's at times like this that it should be become glaringly apparent to most recalcitrant of Small Government Thinkers where strong government regulations keep us safe...a government that puts academics and professionals in leadership roles instead of corporate CEOs.
2020-02-21 18:00,"The lack of testing, and testing capacity, here in the US is deeply alarming and frankly a scandal. The number of cases is both a function of actual prevalence and the testing being done (and what criteria there are for tests). South Korea has done 13,000 tests - that's why it's finding so many cases. The CDC has only disclosed 500 tests in the whole US - unbelievable considering how much larger we are, and how many more travelers from the original source regions arrived here in the December-January timeframe. The testing criteria in the US are unbelievably limiting considering what we're seeing in countries with FAR fewer travelers from China in the December-January period. Community spread in the US is almost certainly here. 

This is an emergency, and is certainly a pandemic at this point. We need to get very serious about this and move fast. The distributed /regional nature of health care in the US will make this a challenge but there's absolutely no excuse for the lack of coordination and delays we are seeing now. It's not clear anyone is actually in charge and moving with the urgency that's needed."
2020-02-21 18:13,"Isn't this virus making the argument for universal healthcare more effectively than Bernie or Warren could do in a debate? Viruses can be quite ""eloquent"" in making their arguments."
2020-02-21 18:23,"The main strategy in dealing with this coronavirus outbreak is undoubtedly to slow down the spread of the disease until it hopefully slows down on its own in the northern hemisphere as summer approaches and to allow the most time possible to develop treatment strategies like vaccines and testing existing anti-viral drugs.

That said, the question that begs answers is how governments will react to economic distress. The U.S. stock markets still appear unphased by this disease but how long will that last as negative economic and political worries keep mounting?"
2020-02-21 17:58,"So Iran refused to acknowledged the infections early on in order to avoid offending China. It stopped flights to China relatively late. This shows how much power China now has in the region. 

The Iranian regime rather its own people suffer than offend China. Meanwhile, the same regime paints the US flag on the entrance to public toilets. This further confirms what I've been saying for years: the US sanctions against Iran accomplish little to weaken the regime, but they do increase the suffering of the Iranian people, and enhance China's and Russia's influence and presence in Iran."
2020-02-21 17:59,"I keep thinking of Bush's notorious praise for the head of FEMA during Hurricane Katrina (""great job Brownie"") as Katrina victims lived in squalor in a stadium if they were ""lucky,"" or drowned if they were unlucky. I keep thinking, we are all Katrina victims now. We are now all in this together. And our leadership doesn't seem to be much more competent than that exhibited during Katrina."
2020-02-21 18:00,"The US has cases, too. If we plan to cut off states from each other here from trade and travel, what? As we add that more realistic  panic to the global rush to economic chaos and mutual fear. After all, the affected states are a heck of a lot closer than China or Iraq."
2020-02-21 18:06,"The handling of the Diamond Princess passengers is hardly going to help this situation. The ship was an incubator for the disease and the Japanese authorities let passengers leave after their so-called quarantine. Japan should have demanded that every country with citizens on the ship repatriate their own, or pay to have them properly quarantined in Japan, well away from the incubator ship. 
I can’t believe the WHO didn’t step in to insist on proper quarantining before passengers and crew walked around streets, malls; airports."
2020-02-21 17:54,"The animated graphic showing “before” and “after” air traffic is an excellent reporting technique.

Perhaps your reporters could do another showing the “before” and  “after” manufacturing in China.  I’m sure it would make a stunning graphic message.

At the same time as we are gearing up to fight this epidemic, we will likely to facing a recession and its consequences for the world economy.

Another graphic might relate to the economy.  Simply showing, via  arrows and bubbles, the multiplicity of aspects to this virus and the interactions of them which may be ahead of us.

Thank you again for these daily updates and the fine reporting!"
2020-02-21 18:31,"Where is the CDC?

Faulty test kits and poor communication to citizens about pandemic preparation. Slashed budgets, bickering over costs. 

Every day that passes without strong leadership and transparent communication by CDC officials increases anxiety."
2020-02-21 18:20,WHO should take the blame as it countries to remain open to China.

2020-02-21 18:42,"San Antonio has two more infected people this afternoon, from the Yokohama group."
2020-02-21 18:41,"Most scary about this new virus is that American health officials have so-far been vague about the method of its transmission. Is it spread through human to human contact—by inhalation of airborne particles or skin to skin? Or is the virus transmitted through other means—like shared air supply or food? Wearing masks seems to have little affect on slowing the contagion—nor, it seems does wearing full hospital protection. One day news reports seem hopeful, the next not. Does this virus fall in the same category as SARS and Ebola—or is it something even more aggressive? I wish I had more confidence that our government was telling the truth about future risk—but a president who redraws a NOAA weather map to prove a point is certainly capable of interfering with critical public health data generated by the CDC or NHO."
2020-02-21 18:42,WHO is completely useless... This is its moment and it is not stepping up... How should it discipline or lean on countries who are ignoring the virus? How should it coordinate the world's response? How should it provide testing ability to poor countries with little health infrastructure? Who else but WHO can accomplish this and how can it corral the world's rich countries to fight this battle for the poor countries... for all of our sakes.
2020-02-21 18:51,It is a virus. It does not know or care or have a country boundaries. It will become a virus like flu and human really needs to learn and deal with it like any other diseases.
2020-02-21 19:29,"With majority people asymptomatic, focusing only on incubation period may not make much sense. The assumption is that if someone is infected, the person will show symptoms within the incubation period, so if not, they are free. But the virus does not disappear after ""incubation"" period, and asymptomatic people will continue to have the virus inside."
2020-02-21 19:30,I do believe more drastic measures to curtail world travel for several weeks is now indicated. I don't think it's too much to expect every citizen everywhere to sacrifice a few weeks for the sake of the world. It now appears the COVID-19 is a super fast spreading disease and may even be carried by migrating birds as well as the air in passenger and air freight planes. Transit quarentine measures are not working.
2020-02-21 19:43,"The CDC estimates  there have been 16,000 - 41,000 influenza deaths from 10/01/19 - 02/15/20 so far. 

As in any situation, don't panic. It helps no one. 

- Wash your hands frequently
- Use bleach wipes - according to NCBI bleach is the strongest and most effective disinfectant
- Don't shake hands"
2020-02-21 19:50,"I believe the CDC, although experts, are hampered by economic and political considerations. Stricter quarantine and travel bans are needed before it is too late. The mortality rate appears 25 times that of the flu and appears two to three times more infectious at a minimum. You don't have to be an epidemiologist to imagine the potential for an awful outbreak in this nation and others. People should understand that antibiotics don't touch viruses. People seem fascinated by the recent impeachment which accomplished zero and debates which seem endless but the corona virus  is not getting the attention it needs. I don't believe this is rumor mongering. I'm just saying don't fiddle while Rome burns."
2020-02-21 19:15,"Of course all of this sickness is great news because, as Wilbur Ross said three weeks ago, ""it will help to accelerate the return of jobs to North America."""
2020-02-21 19:22,Is it true that Trumputin tried to cut this and last year's CDC budget?  Will we have enough beds to treat the severe cases if this thing goes pandemic here? Will the Red states be worst hit?
2020-02-21 19:26,"Give Iran some credit - it is the only relatively poor country to acknowledge cases - perhaps because the economic fallout will be negligible because it’s already under sanctions.
Are we really going to believe advanced countries like Singapore and S Korea have many case while  poor countries with large populations like Indonesia an Pakistan have no cases?"
2020-02-21 19:13,"America is handling this like a bunch of bumbling idiots. Anthony Faucci needs to resign. He is talking nothing but nonsense. I used to respect him but not anymore. Out of one orifice he state quarantines don't work (when referring to china). But then Americans are brought home infected to what? A quarantine here.  I thought they didn't work!

Local epidemiologists are sitting in their offices telling front line doctors here in the United States to treat everyone like the flu. The reality is that providers in China are dying from treating Covid-19. Easy for them to make that decision when their lives aren't on the line. They sit in their ivory towers making a bundle, at no risk.

China is not a 3rd world country, their high alarm should be taken with a great deal of respect. I remember when I was involved in early HIV care here in America. We changed the definition of the disease frequently as we learned more. This is a normal process when investigating a new dangerous disease. Chinese medical doctors are going thru the same process.

That we are recklessly returning known infectagons is not only dangerous, its arrogant."
2020-02-21 17:26,"Practical problem, here in the USA. Case example (true): man goes to pick up girlfriend from flight at JFK airport, she’s flown a lot to China (Hong Kong, Beijing, but not Hubei province). She’s told just prior to the quarantine measures being enforced that she should simply self-isolate at home. He develops a cough and cold within a week of picking her up from the airport .....and as a police officer he goes to work thinking it’s nothing just a cold, doesn’t see a doctor. He also picks up his ten year old daughter from school and she develops a “cold.” Mother takes the child to pediatrician who tells her that no primary or pediatricians in the USA have a test for coronavirus and to bring the child back to the doctor if she develops a fever. $35 copay for the flu test (negative) and office visit. Doctor explains that only a trip to a hospital ($150 co pay, which has the Coronavirus test) would result in the child being tested for Coronavirus. Child returns to school, with a fellow student who is in remission for cancer, and the father shrugs off his cold and returns to working as a police officer. True story because I’m the kid’s mom!!! That’s how a pandemic spreads, folks!"
2020-02-21 19:59,"My husband and I plan to travel to and from our home in Florida, with a side trip to British Columbia, and we are worried, especially since one of us has COPD. It has been determined that this virus could be airborne. I know that it is inconvenient, but we are willing to be disrupted even more than we normally are when we are traveling by air.  It is time for the CDC to get moving and check everyone and anyone who gets onto a plane from wherever they are coming from or going to; this is serious virus and potentially deadly.  If it is a matter of checking temperatures, or spotting something that is obvious, then so be it.  We will do our part by washing our hands often, and sanitizing all that we can on board once we do enter or waiting to do so.  There is not a mask to be had in all of Bay Ridge in Sunset Park, in Brooklyn, and from what I've heard, they might not be effective anyway.   Prevention and attention to details could continue to help in stemming the spread of what could become a Pandemic.  We need to work together."
2020-02-21 16:30,"I still remember the day when I purchased 80 masks that can, purportedly, filter out 95% of the dangerous particulates (smog, virus, etc) out there. That was on 1/18. Two days later, I received my masks. In two days, however, the shortage of masks has become as epidemic as the coronavirus. It's been a month since then, and I am still clinging onto that box of masks I got in January, reusing the ones I've used so as to make them last as long as possible; I do not know when I can purchase more masks, nor do I know when this plague would end. 

Living day to day alongside the state-wise mendacity may not be that different from living with freedom if you are not interested in the non-materialistic side of life. In richer sections, even if the traffic of the entire city is shut down, you can still get your Wagyu steak through grocery delivery apps. For many, it's nothing more than a prolonged holiday. Living in my city (and perhaps in my social stratum), I can see how for many this is but a nuisance, a disruption to their otherwise ""normal"" life. At the same time, people are dying and starving in Wuhan. People with chronic or terminal conditions there cannot obtain medical attention and cannot leave town. Experts espouse the propriety of state's reaction to the virus, praising it as timely. ""Sensitive"" videos and tweets are deleted as soon as they are posted. We are witnessing, ladies and gentlemen, how this government is inflicting yet another humanitarian crisis."
2020-02-21 16:58,I am comforted with the fact that Trump has cut the CDC budget by $750 million in 2019 and will cut it even more in 2020 to make the US much safer if the virus spreads in the US. Also Trump would enact additional tax cuts to the mega wealthy to take on the virus head on. It is also great that the US has the best health care in the world for the wealthy - that will keep us all safe - not like that socialist Medicare for All that would allow actual health care for all.
2020-02-21 18:47,"The Coronavirus blame game is alive and thriving. (sigh) The cat is well out of the bag folks and no matter how much hand wringing and outrage, the virus won't suddenly stop spreading the more we whine. Planes are still flying, ships are still sailing, and people are still congregating in public. It's what humans do unless forced not to and even then, not so much.   

The world is too interconnected and, let's face it, we'd see similar outrage and blame if we were all suddenly told we had to stay home and not go to work, school, church, or get on a plane.

It serves no purpose to pontificate about how this country did or did not do X or why the WHO or CDC should be blamed. Be calm, take sensible measures, and wash your hands."
2020-02-21 20:13,"It's maddening, looking back on it, when China argued the US was being punitive for banning travel, contrary to recommendations from WHO but it turns out you can't trust China to properly contain or even diagnose the disease.  The government of China is an embarrassment  to the chinese people."
2020-02-21 20:39,"Yesterday, our local health department reported that an individual returning from China to our locale tested positive and was advised to ‘self-isolate’ along with a ‘close associate’ who was exhibiting early symptoms.

These people went to the ER, where they were supposedly ‘treated’ before being sent home. Zero information has been provided to our small community as to when these people returned from China, nor whom they’ve potentially exposed...on the return flight, at local grocery stores, shops, classrooms, and at the hospital.

The ongoing recklessness in response to this virus is absolutely breathtaking.  Hence, a pandemic."
2020-02-21 20:22,"At my medical providers, I have always thought one of the primary vectors of disease transmission are the pens and touch screens you have to use to sign away your rights.

I don't know if such are used in any of these instances but, if so, they need to be sterilized between each use or, preferably, done away with."
2020-02-21 20:26,"It's spread to the Middle East. It's spread to South Korea. If it's there it most certainly is in North Korea. North Korea certainly isn't going to be forthcoming about how many cases they've found or how widespread it is. 
President Trump has downplayed it by proclaiming that as soon as the weather turns warm, it will ""miraculously"" go away.
China has admitted that 500 prisoners have it. You can't get more ""quarantined"" than being in prison. And we don't have a clue if it's in any of those muslim ""re-education"" camps."
2020-02-21 20:39,"There is absolutely no reason to fear that this virus is going to spread globally. The truth of the matter is that this virus already has spread globally, and nothing we do now is going to stop it. 

When you read about reports of confirmed cases in various countries, please remember that most infected people have mild symptoms, and will not seek medical attention. This will inevitably lead to most infected people not being detected, and continuing to spread the infection in their communities. That is what is happening right now. Give it another month or two, and we will see a worldwide surge in hospital admissions for pneumonia and other severe respiratory diseases. Testing will reveal Covid-19 in cases without any travel history or other obvious source of infection. 

The only thing that can stop the widespread dissemination of a new, highly contagious virus that is spread by droplet or airborne route is travel bans along with strict quarantines. Screening at airports, which is all that is being done in most countries, is useless because it cannot detect cases in the incubation period. 

Meanwhile, the geniuses at WHO still do not recommend any restrictions on travel. That entire incompetent lot needs to be sent on a one way trip to Wuhan, since they are so keen on promoting travel."
2020-02-21 20:45,"Increased Covid-19 infections are being reported in Beijing, Japan, US, South Korea, Iran and Italy.  Modern day Typhoid Mary type Covid-19 super-spreaders are also being found.

We are also dealing with the flu, which is considered to be worse than typical.

Now throw in the fact that China has been less than upfront with information, details, including not cooperating with expert groups like our own CDC.

I am of the opinion that when historians look back, they will say: ""Too Little, Too Late!"""
2020-02-21 20:47,"And still no cases in Indonesia? Yeah right.. there must be hundreds if not more.

The cases in Iran were people who had no contact with Chinese citizens. They reportedly contracted it from Pakistani pilgrims (the Iranian city of Qom, where the first cases were reported, has a few important shrines). This seems to indicate the virus travels silently through some countries, like Pakistan but likely others too, probably those countries that have the dangerous mix of poor healthcare infrastructure and misguided nationalism."
2020-02-21 20:47,"Yes, it is true that the coronavirus may yet be contained. But what if it is not, and the number of people infected continues to grow? Should we prepare for such a development? As a concerned physician I would say yes. One would argue that the preparation, in any country where there are a significant number of infections, should include the rapid construction of dedicated medical facilities, including hospitals, that are specifically designed to handle patients with this kind of highly contagious infection. There are no such hospitals now, where each and every patient room and intensive care room is an isolation room. Since 1918, we have had no such need. We do now.

Without such additional facilities, the present hospital system will be sorely challenged to properly care for an expanding number of critically ill patients, whose infections are highly communicable. 
The required hospitals need not be fancy; but they need to be ready, just in case. 

One further point. In the U.S., no matter your political persuasion, one argues that the funds, should come from those planned for “the wall,” because the imminent threat from the coronavirus far exceeds any present threat that might exist from illegal immigration. The “wall” can be built later. Let’s address the clear and present danger we now face. Isn't such a dedicated hospital system now an essential part of our national defense?"
2020-02-21 21:10,"I'm curious what effect the travel & industry shutdowns will have on CO2 emissions and short term weather effects.

Is the cold snap we are having an effect of 800 million people suddenly hunkering down?"
2020-02-21 21:15,"As a retired RN, I have been very concerned here in Florida that people, particularly those with limited income or non-residents, will avoid hospitals until they are truly in respiratory crisis. We have one of the highest levels of ""surprise billing"" from hospitals in the country, and I've been a victim of this myself. Our surprise bills can be many thousands of dollars, just for walking into an ER for evaluation.  Most prudent people not on Medicare or Medicaid try to avoid hospitals here, unless they are very wealthy. But that means if Covid-19 gains a foothold in this state, and I remind you all this is the start of Spring Break, and we are a tourist economy, it may be well entrenched before it is formally acknowledged. Scary scenario."
2020-02-21 16:41,"The elephant in the room is that we now have an emergent virus that spreads easily through human contact and contact with surfaces. Although this coronavirus appears to be much less lethal than SARS or MERS, future mutations could be deadly. 

The U.S. should be preparing for the next pandemic. Instead, we are scaling down and letting a science-phobic unstable President dictate policy. This is a recipe for disaster."
2020-02-21 21:45,"It appears likely that this virus will get out of control within the US.  Trump delayed for at least 7 days the imposition of the travel ban on people who had been to China (and quarantine of returning Americans).  Many other countries have refused to impose travel bans resulting in spread now to other countries.  Trump has failed to expand the travel ban to close the border to ALL non-US citizens wherever they come from (and quarantine of ALL returning Americans wherever they come from).

So, the virus is likely going to rage here soon.  But there is now a situation existent that could become a major health threat in the US that encompasses much more than just the threat posed by this virus.  For the past 20 years, through both Democrat and Republican administrations, the politicians of both parties have allowed selfish pharmaceutical companies to rely upon China production of a large portion of our medicines.  Even medicines manufactured outside China were allowed to become dependent upon China production of key ingredients of those medicines.  That China production is now in severe jeopardy because of the virus raging in China.  Americans could soon be facing lack of availability of many medications to treat many medical problems."
2020-02-21 19:10,This is scary. Iranian authorities said that Coronavirus they beleive is now in every big city of Iran.  It can spread like wild fire to middle east and expect Iran to be non-transparent with numbers.
2020-02-21 20:56,I feel like we are slow walking into a crisis with the occupants of the clown car in charge. I have zero confidence in anyone in or associated with the Trump administration and the Republican Party.

2020-02-21 17:36,"Likely source of infection in Iran are the Chinese workers in the city of Qom. Photos show a lack of protective gear on medical workers.

And the polling numbers for the national election in Iran look unusually low. Political boycott or an abundance of caution on the part of the populace?"
2020-02-21 20:58,"My spouse and I are canceling a Baltic cruise for this June because:

1. Most cruise lines reserve the right to alter or curtail the schedule and itinerary without refunds; and cancel-for-any reason insurance will be about half the cost of the cruise.

2. We are both over 70 and thus at higher risk of becoming seriously ill or even dying from COVID-19 if we contract it.

3. In the best of times cruise ships are floating Petri dishes that easily spread noroviruses; note the current COVID-19 transmissions on the Diamond Princess and Holland America Westerdam.

4. While the ports on our cruise are in countries that currently have fewer than 25 or so cases, it is possible that the coronavirus could become a pandemic affecting thousands in many countries, including those on our itinerary. Our nightmare scenario is that we or other passengers contract the disease aboard or in port. Do we want to be treated or quarantined on the ship or in Latvia or Estonia or Russia or Finland or Denmark? No way.

For us the medical/financial risks are just too great, so for the rest of 2020 we are planning to limit our travel to US destinations we can reach easily by car or short flights. As months go by we will evaluate the coronavirus situation and see how cruise lines and foreign countries are coping. There’s always next year.

My comments are not medical advice, which readers should seek from their physicians. For travel advice, talk to your travel agent, carrier and insurance agent."

No, we childishly obsessed about NDA's, cursing, name forgetting, and how many houses the old men had. And we wonder why our politicians and media are so disrespected?

There was a big electronic sign about keeping COVID-19 out of NZ. Except for people arriving on flights from Australia, the USA, or Singapore, everyone was routed to a special immigration line where their passports were checked page by page to see if they had stamps from China.

2020-02-21 21:21,"China must exercise better control over it's rich citizens. Maybe prison sentences for citizens who break the laws and eat exotic wildlife, and LONG prison sentences for public officials who accept bribes to look the other way.  Other countries have this problem (like the US where congressmen have obviously been legally paid off to  decrease taxes for the rich) but for China, it is a matter of not unleashing dangerous viruses on the world. The alternative is to wall China off from the rest of the world. Figure it out China. We were willing to look the other way as your rich made the Rhino extinct using powdered Rhino horns as aphrodisiacs, but the virus thing is a deal breaker. Literally."

Some of those returning people from China into canada don’t mind to send there kids to school the next day, don’t isolate after arrival and the school board announced they are powerless to prevent it. The ironic thing is that yesterday’s latest confirmed case is someone just in from Iran who can no contact with Chinese people. We have19 cases in B.C. now. The health ministers was “surprised” by this fact and not sure what to do about it. Looks like we are here for a long epidemic until a vaccine comes. My friends working in virology in China tell me 3 of the drugs being tested work well and that China is racing to make a vaccine. Lucky thing for the world is China can do human trials without red tape and fast track medications or vaccines as well as produce them super fast in good quality. The meds are available here, but one might need to fly to China for the vaccine as I imagine getting it approved in North America will take years.

Not to minimize the potential of a coronavirus epidemic, but we do have a tendency to overweight and overreact to peculiar risks— like a guy with plastic explosives in his sneakers — while taking far greater risks in stride as we become inured to them as ‘just the normal noises.’"
2020-02-22 2:06,"My thoughts, if things ever got bad here and I was in doubt, I would simply self-isolate.  You do not need a test to self-isolate. Order food and have it delivered. Have the food left at your front door.  The majority of those infected can ride this out without severe symptoms. Call 911 if you develop severe symptoms."
2020-02-22 3:42,"No one has any idea how many cases there really are and confirmed cases are probably less than half of the actual cases. Trying to contain it just disrupts more than really needs to be disrupted especially given that there is likely no way to really stop the spread. I doubt the virus is that much more deadly than a typical influenza.

I wonder, given the greed and ignorance of Americans whether the fear is economic or that people will die, or if people think they will be the ones who die. I suspect anything our government does, especially now, is really about fear that a few serfs will die before every last drop of profit is squeezed out of them. For the people I think they fear their own deaths, which I think is typical of religious people who have an obsession with their own mortality. So much so that they need to believe in imaginary beings in the sky in order to sleep at night. 

I suspect that hardly anyone fears for the deaths of others, it's not a very American or Christian thing to do."

Hawaii is the most blatant case in point. There was a known case of coronavirus on the islands. The CDC maintains there is nothing to worry about, as there are no other cases of coronavirus on the islands. However, the CDC only acknowledges cases that test positive by their test kits. Hawaii has no virus test kits, so no ability to test for the virus. The CDC's reasoning that if there are no positive tests, there is no virus, even when they CAN'T test-- this sounds like a definition of insanity.  They are burying their heads in the sand and utterly failing to contain this while we have (had?) the chance."

So as the first commenter said, ""Bravo Mr. Zhang"".  Bravo Ms. Wang, too, for a beautiful story. Your account proves, in microcosm, that people will still look out for total strangers -- at their own risk, and in the worst situations.

Just the other day I was reading that among Silicon Valley billionaires the latest status symbol is a secure getaway in New Zealand. The idea being that when upheaval (or pandemic) arrives, they'll helicopter out of Mountainview, hop a private jet to the antipodes, and wait it out in some luxurious 8,000 sq. ft.

An unmentioned side effect of Amazon buy ahead is that if the supply chain impact is less than anticipated, the glut of supply may drive down prices locally, and cause disruption for the manufacturers who have to slow production while the surplus is worked through."
2020-02-20 18:14,"Amazon has already jumped the shark. They had plenty of trouble with meeting demand and upholding their Prime agreement over the holidays, even before this happened, and thanks to their 'lean' inventory, you can't depend on them to have what you want in stock in the middle of July either. Essentially you pay for Prime and they decide when you get your merchandise.

There are other retailers online who do have things in stock, ship just as quickly, and have prices just as competitive, because they're trying to beat the Amazon that used to be. I've systematically moved all of my purchases elsewhere. Other companies are more human, shipments arrive undamaged and on time, and everybody is happy."
2020-02-20 18:29,"Lean inventories started with most retailers years ago.  I remember when Walmart's computer system for the maintenance of inventories and shipping was touted as being as powerful as the Pentagon's. For a long time now, I've seen unstocked shelves and  ""item inventory"" cards displayed there and the shelves of other retailers.  For the malls, this particularly, has been their demise.  Better to see it not available online than to have driven to the store to find out."
2020-02-20 18:36,"It’s really not about whether any of us “like” Amazon or not. There are issues here that impact everyone. Amazon is one of the biggest companies in the country and contributes to our economy and workforce. Also, all the folks who use Amazon Pantry, order their batteries from amazon, etc will have to use other stores if amazon’s supplies dwindle. Other stores might not have enough supplies to keep up with the extra business.

It’s like dominoes. Nothing is separate from anything else. The ripple effect. It’s all connected. We’re all connected."

No I am not enjoying  people are hurting!

But given the fact that Amazon does not have any control of what product comes to me after being a a prime member for over 11 years I have up on my prime membership  to stop to a end of spurious items flowing to me .. 


Some times its getting mixed  with items ""ship and sold by Amazon""  and no way to catch that my  shower gel has way more soda than the one from Target purchased next day !

I hope Amazon makes sure its using vetted sources of the products  next time they get their shipments from China !

Hope this man made virus crisis ends soon for us as a human race and I can become prime member again after the cleanup of the shelves in Amazon :)"

China controls the world's commerce by making vast numbers of pieces, parts and finished products. While someone might not be able get a notebook or smart speaker there will also be HVAC vendors who can't get a switch to complete their product. Another product will be automobile parts (both new and aftermarket). GM suffered a shortage this summer due to a strike and it was no pretty for those needing their cars repaired. There are many more companies who are highly concerned about this and many of them make and sell products that we need."
2020-02-20 20:01,Lean inventories and the Just in Time management approach to inventory control have been the pinnacle of good manufacturing practices for over 20 years now. The current problems evidenced by the coronavirus have always been understood as a weak point of this approach.

The disruption to the economic system will cascade to some degree depending on the nature and severity of the original disaster.//"
2020-02-20 21:33,"It's probably good that we finally appreciate how much we depend on China. The supply chain is invisible to most of us so now is as good a time to find out as any.

As for lean inventories and disruptions, companies that practice this, most famously Toyota, learn how to manage when things go wrong. Small disruptions occur all the time and these should be used as learning opportunities for the time when the Big One occurs. Maybe Amazon will get better as it works through this. Its supply chains are a lot bigger and more complex than Toyota's.

As for Amazon-bashing, let's not forget when we all bashed Microsoft, and before that IBM, and before that the Telephone Company, and before that Standard Oil. Bashing is fun but those who do it do not face the challenges that the bashed ones face or deliver the service or products."

One that came from England came in the posted international period predicted.  The one shipped from China took an extra two weeks to arrive and be delivered in the USA.  Even the supplier noted that the coronavirus virus's disruption may have been the cause."

2020-02-20 22:18,"Is there anything Amazon can't be blamed for?  Lean inventory has been around for decades.  It drove every company I worked for, under various names, one of which the acronym was actually LEAN.  Another was called Just In Time, which meant materials were ordered to arrive ""just in time"" to manufacture the products ordered as the orders came in. It was Wall Street-driven then and continues to be.  Stock ratings go up and down depending on how much inventory a company has on hand."
2020-02-20 22:18,"On your title:

Actually, all one has to do is walk into a now-Amazon-owned Whole Foods store to see some of the weakness on their the Amazon system.

Perhaps it avoids some level of food waste, but it also results in frequently-empty shelves, customers driving all the way there only to find that they are out of stock or too low on stock on an item.  This situation then just adds to Amazon’s already-over-the-top carbon- and traffic-footprint, as shoppers then drive to a competitor for the item or order it online, which then requires added packaging, shipping, and round-trip driver delivery with all the layers of carbon footprint there.  Even if they started using drones (not!!!) the adverse impacts on the physical and social environment would likely be substantial.

All the tech bros get off on the “move fast and break things” motto, but most people, including most really smart people, still see the wisdom in the older adage, “If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it.”"
2020-02-20 22:26,"The ability of Amazon to make a lot of money and to diversify with it is fundamentally dependent upon not keeping big inventories. Big inventories like well stocked store shelves tie up vast amounts of money, capital, which is depreciating in value the longer that the merchandise sits on those shelves. Keeping minimal inventory to satisfy quick turnover of goods is what gives on-line sellers the greatest advantage over brick and mortar stores. The only trick is knowing how much to keep on hand to keep the stock moving."
2020-02-20 23:03,Might there be a silver lining in the epidemic? Help people realize that they don't really need the junk that Amazon sells?
2020-02-20 23:08,"Important question:

Can we trust that Amazon and its Chinese and other suppliers will know how to, and be certain to, prevent the spread of the virus via products or packaging, shipping and delivery methods?  How can we consumers be sure that material coming from or through areas where the virus has migrated will be free of virus material still active?  There are so many different kinds and texture and porousness of material and shipping conditions.  What is the life-span or half-life of the virus under both ideal conditions for its vitality and conditions less hospitable?  If it is a novel virus, how can we be sure of that information?  Is the credible scientific certainty that the virus isn’t infectious when dried or dead?

Might be helpful and interesting for NYT to report to readers answers to these and related questions."
2020-02-20 23:09,"Was wondering if just in time inventory developed when materials were available closer to home rather than in China? Sadly, this story is a rude reminder of how consumer-dependent we are on such a complex delivery system. Making a list of wants versus needs right now."

A store with zero bananas... What's the story, Amazon? You can't blame China. I wish my regular grocery store weren't so filthy and pathetic. I'd love to find a new place that has decent food and one-stop shopping."
2020-02-21 7:01,Amazon’s lean inventory comes at the expense of its suppliers’ stocking up to meet demand uncertainties. This pushes the costs away from retailers to suppliers and their next vendors. Any disruption to supply chain will be exacerbated once current inventory in the pipeline is depleted and July Prime day starts looking shaky quickly.
2020-02-21 11:30,"This holds true for other companies such as Walmart as well, which rely upon ""just in time"" delivery. Our local Walmart is often poorly stocked as it is and has large numbers of bare shelves on a good day. I often have to order online and pick it up at the store in order to get the product. If I can I'll just order from Amazon and skip the trip to Walmart. And yeah, I'd rather buy local but that's just not so easy here in rural America. 

As for those commenters who proclaim that this is good and we'll buy less junk, while that is indeed true, there are also so many products that we rely on that are manufactured in China or dependent on parts from China. So not only will we have to forgo things that we may depend on but the reduced sales will harm businesses and put employees out of work. 

There's a good list at the ""Organic Prepper"" website which focuses on products that come from China; everything from many of our medications to food to auto parts. There's also a book, ""A Year Without Made in China"" which I recommend reading to get a feel for our current state of affairs. We have invited disaster on ourselves by shifting manufacture of so many things overseas to where it can be done cheaper with lax environmental regs. We may well dearly pay for this hubris."
2020-02-21 12:54,"No, you don't have to raise prices. Any company that does that is gouging the customer."
2020-02-21 14:41,"Maybe it's time to bring manufacturing back to the United States.  
Yes, products will probably be more expensive but that is a small price to pay for avoiding this virus and bringing more jobs to Americans."
2020-02-21 10:27,"One has to realize that Amazon is really nothing more than the mall gone digital.  It makes almost none of what is purchased through its portals.  It merely facilitates the transaction and, like all middle men, extracts their cut of the proceeds.  

This is not to be critical; we American's do love our malls don't we?  The ascension in the ubiquity of the 'Net and the concomitant rise in Amazon's equity price is the physical proof of that love isn't it?  

But as this article makes clear the desire to be lean and mean, as evinced by their systemic processes, does leave them open to random acts, natural or otherwise.  It's the chink in their armor; one they can never entirely eliminate because, as middle men, they never entirely control those that actually produce the goods.  

It's the woes all physical mall owners would understand.

2020-02-20 13:59,"Holland American Lines claimed that no passengers on the Westerdam were infected by the COVID-19 virus. Subsequently it was allowed to dock in Cambodia, and passengers were allowed to leave the ship, tour the country, as well as make arrangements to return to their homes.

A short time later a passenger from the ship who had flown to Malaysia was found to be infected by the virus. Holland American Lines insisted she be retested, and she was _again_ found to be infected. Physicians believe it is possible she might have infected other passengers.

After the initial infection was confirmed, an American man who had worked on the Westerdam and was confined to his hotel in Cambodia, bragged on YouTube that he sneaked out of Cambodia and returned to the USA. The story was verified by a Washington State news source. He claims to have been ""cleared by the CDC"" and insists that he has no symptoms. 

This is how epidemics spread and become pandemics."

I feel that Princess Cruises is not 100% blameless in this because they learned of the first cases diagnosis sometime between 30 Jan and 1 Feb, but chose to continue cruising as normal till arrival in Yokohama, instead of limiting passenger contact at that point to curb spread. The minute crew members were found to be infected, there would also be a need to isolate not just the other crew sharing their sleeping quarters but also the passengers served by the crew who had fallen ill.  Granted there isn't a lot of real estate on board but the public rooms aren't in use so they could be converted to temporary crew quarters. Japan should also have mobilized local caterers to provide the food in order to minimize sick crew handling food that becomes a vector throughout the ship. Keeping people feeling ""on vacation"" in an emergency like this has been costly in the toll of not just deaths but the 29 serious cases from the ship"
2020-02-20 16:27,"Japan did not consult an infectious disease expert to investigate the cruise ship quarantine protocols prior to releasing the passengers. 
An infectious disease dr from Kobe voluntarily went on-board and found many problems and said the quarantine system was chaotic. When he returned home he put himself in isolation away from his family and coworkers. 
He warned of the dangerous decision to allow the untested passengers to go free into the Japanese population. 
Japan respects the chain of command in their bureaucracy to a fault. Decisions are made by people who don't know what they are doing simply because they are the next person in line, the boss. 
I think this is a perfect example of a bureaucrat who was in charge and made a terrible, rash decision."

Why are there only 52 cases pending, and a total of only 427 tests done since January 21, 2020?  The CDC keeps saying transmission is not occurring in the USA, but how can they say that when they are not looking? At this point I’m concerned that American health care workers with pneumonia of unclear etiology are not being tested for SARS-CoV19. I keep hoping the press will start looking at what we are doing and not doing. I think the concerns about causing panic exceed the damage caused by lack of transparency. 

I understand the current test has many false negatives, especially when throat swabs are used and not nasal swabs. I understand home isolation of suspect cases is a solid public health procedure. I worry public health officials are being overconfident in their approach. The death toll is not the only issue, the 20% who get really sick is the terrible part. Our health care system will be overwhelmed leaving heart attack and stroke victims waiting. Health insurance companies are being awfully quiet about their plans."

Without stopping this criminal activity, unknown viruses will appear in regular intervals. China has to finally take efficient measures to stop the repetitive initiation of pandemics after 20 years of inertia. Prevention means abandoning some pseudo-traditional food habits for the sake of world health. We have to make this clear to the Chinese government and tie it to trade-relations."

Correct on that matter but its many times more deadly  and is even more contagious than the flu and to think one of the two commenting is a nurse.  I suggest that this person go back to nursing school and study harder,  this type of lackadaisical attitude is what will cause a world wide pandemic.  Stupid fools.  The U.S. is ripe for a massive pandemic.  Just think,  the low percentage of people not even washing their hands after using the bathroom guarantees  a pandemic.  Wash your hands; don't wear a mask is the mantra pushed by medical professionals.

2020-02-21 0:04,"What's happening in Daegu, South Korea is concerning, but it will yield reliable data on transmissions. The cluster in Japan took place in a cruise ship but the one in Daegu happened in a much more representative place (church and then to surrounding areas). With so much expertise and journalists, what unfolds in Daegu will teach us a lot about what strategies work and whether if the virus can be contained once it spreads into the population. It may just be that we're going to see a pandemic, and we'll have to live with the virus and pivot towards treatment and vaccine."
2020-02-21 0:46,"Western resistance to quarantine is based on historical abuses, some of which were racist while others simply reflected the likelihood of transmission within sequestered communities and the crowded living quarters of sojourners who understandably lived with maximum economy.  But guilt is not science.  Quarantines have been used and useful for centuries, and can now be conducted with the aid of informed science instead of just fear.  Hand washing is effective but mostly voluntary and creates vulnerability through non-compliance.  Isolation is effective until latency outruns it.  While draconian, quarantine needs to remain in the toolbox."

2020-02-21 1:29,"I thank NYT for comprehensive reporting from around the globe on this Wuhan virus.

I think, in 2 years - when researchers study global response to combating this virus - we may find some very interesting results.

And some may show that all this quarantine was over done.

And if response to it was similar - and more, crucially, not panicky -  to a flu epidemic might have been more effective.

Also, earlier reports have shown that Wuhan virus is most effective in cold weather or environment.

I know most of the northern world including China is in winter with cold temperatures.

I wonder if Chinese or any researchers are doing a case study that if hospitals or facilities are warned up - spread of Wuhan virus diminishes considerably or even stops."

2020-02-21 1:27,"I am relatively certain that whatever may be the primary agent of this virus transmission one-to-another, very likely has nothing to do with someone’s ‘propensity’ to spew germs. What does that even mean.  I am relatively certain, also, it is not the case that fewer infections by this virus occur in people whose immune systems are more ‘exuberant’.  Is this the kind of science explanations we can expect from the experts, that there is a genie in certain people who thereby spew more germs; a genie that makes some people’s immunity stronger?  Are we to believe of all the data from thousands of cases globally, that the so call experts cannot identify the patterns of transmission?  Maybe we need to jettison the change agents and newly baked engineers at NIH and WHO, etc., and get some real medical researchers who know how to figure out this epidemic.  One thing in this article is crystal clear, that the experts cited therein appear to know nothing, thus their reliance upon euphemisms to explain something that needs hard science.

Amazing transparency. Well done President Xi. No country has ever been as transparent as China and the CCP. - WHO"
2020-02-20 14:00,"China handled an incident in 2004 that enlightens.

In April 2004 the SARS virus escaped a BSL3 lab in Beijing at least three times.  That led to doubts about the biosafety and biosecurity at Chinese virus labs.  China invited WHO experts to the lab to analyze the incidents. WHO investigators had full access.  China had been accused of not being forthcoming and forthright in the 2002 SARS outbreak.  The new outbreak of SARS in Beijing was the fault of a series of flaws at the CDC's National Institute of Virology.  Other lab scientists wanted details about these new 2004 SARS infections and how the virus escaped the lab.  That was their opportunity to learn.  That information was not disclosed.

Nearly 16 years later.

Why hasn’t China allowed WHO investigators to access the Wuhan Institute of Virology BSL4 labs - although some suspect the new coronavirus might have started there?   Investigators could rule out the lab as being complicit or implicate it.

Instead, the visiting WHO team were shown only the Wuhan Airport, Zhongnan hospital, Hubei provincial CDC, including a BSL3 laboratory in China’s Center for Disease Control (CDC)."
2020-02-20 21:27,"Do not believe any numbers whatsoever coming from the Chinese government. Sad but true. They want all news to sound upbeat, things are getting better, or, at least, not getting worse variety. But history (and present day) tells us, not to trust them, at all. This is what a non-transparent self-serving tyrannical government brings the world - disease and distrust.
We need the WHO to step up. To stop praising the Chinese and bring some...health to the world."
2020-02-19 16:29,"Japan was spared the SARS epidemic 17 years ago, and the lack of experience shows. Taiwan, in contrast, was on high alert as soon as the news broke."
2020-02-19 16:31,"It concerns me that Japan seems to be just exporting its problem with the virus.
I hope the U.S. will immediately implement stringent quarantine procedures for all arrivals from Japan as well as Cambodia and China.
There are still too many unanswered questions about how transmittal opportunities and incubation periods for the world to relax its vigilance, especially when there are procedures at hand to limit unnecessary exposure."
2020-02-19 16:37,"Viruses have a large variation in development of symptoms. Rabies, for example, can take anywhere between a couple of weeks to two months from time of infection.

Two months incubation. Hmmm."
2020-02-19 16:54,"This is about the most non-sensical decision ever made!

Japan is supposed to hold the Summer Olympics.  

We already know a person can test negative and be symptom free, while passing along the virus.

Is this the time to experiment?  

The Law of Unintended Consequences now has hundreds of people testing how far the virus can spread from just this one sample of people who’ve been trapped on a virus incubator for 2 weeks."
2020-02-19 16:57,"We seem to be witnessing more and more normalization of deviance in this outbreak. 

It’s a term used largely in aerospace and industry to describe the circumstances when those in charge of operational matters chafe under the paranoia of those who set the original standards (which can often be the same person). Over time, allowances are made for greater and greater deviance from the correct way of doing things and the expedient way becomes the new norm. 

Most of the time there’s no immediate sign this was a bad idea, which only encourages more deviance, until something goes horribly, but predictably wrong.

Challenger, Columbia and the entire Chemical Safety Board channel on YouTube are excellent examples of this in action. I fear the coronavirus outbreak will provide a few more case studies."
2020-02-19 17:07,"Woe unto all of us when the released passengers “release the virus” all over the world.

Who knows, for example, to what degree the virus has mutated?On a ship which provided the ideal incubating conditions for both the mutation and spread of a new pathogen?  To unsuspecting victims?  Who will now become unwitting experimental subjects in an Experiment they never agreed to take part in?

Events have set in motion which are completely predictable - but with unpredictable consequences."
2020-02-19 17:14,"The virus has already spread far and wide to be contained. The passengers from the ship that disembarked in Cambodia have flown around the world. It is likely that the planes they flew in will carry the infection for days and so will their co-passengers and staff. The permutations from that one incident  itself are mind-boggling. There are many others which no-one knows about. It is like putting the genie back in the bottle it came out of, it cannot be done."
2020-02-19 17:14,"“They want to handle the case based on a successful plot that the bureaucrats created, and they just want to follow it,” 

It became painfully evident during the aftermath of earthquake and tsunami in 2011.  Government elites who hold key positions as well as those who are in the chain of command are products of Japanese elite academic education - a system whose sole purpose is to send students through top universities and career track in public and private sector entities.  As such, they have received education that emphasizes excellence in test scores but low on imagination and creativity.  In addition, those who have received top marks (and thus likely to hold highest positions) have had little experience in facing adversity and failures while growing up. 
The resulting elites in Japan lack leadership skills and imagination, fragile when met with challenge. The quote at the beginning summarizes the symptomatic weakness and ineffectiveness of the Japanese government in the face of crisis."
2020-02-19 18:05,"I say it is the best move ever. Please note, when Bats are stressed, that is when they shed the Coronavirus. Why not work on the assumption that it may be the same case in humans? I say, this virus has been roaming world wide since it first started in Wuhan, lord only knows exactly when. It is obviously not a very dangerous virus. What it has succeeded in doing is expose the vulnerability of political bodies to strategize and plan for a pandemic disease that is not so kind. The WHO seems to be as ineffectual as any governmental organization. I say there should be a non-governmental association of the leading epidemiologists formed through billionaire money answerable to no government and completely (at least as much as can be hoped) independent. They should be allowed freely into any country worldwide and consult with any government without hindrance. Also this whole mad rush to make vaccines, is like encouraging gun manufacturers to make more guns to keep America safe. Look where that has got us. I say we need a fresh look at immunity. A fresh look at organisms that co-habit this earth with us. Nothing is  bad or good. It is about what maintains a certain balance that contributes to a positive outcome vs a negative one. I say we refresh our outlook on what constitutes a diseased situation and a different perspective on the why. Perhaps a peek into history far back in time would be a great start."

2020-02-19 16:32,The passengers sick or not should have been evacuated in shifts to their respective countries rather than languishing on this ship of contagion for so long. There are going to be many more incidents requiring tough decision making especially as the virus gains a foothold worldwide. What is WHO doing during all this? And let's hope our CDC and NIH are ready.
2020-02-19 16:36,Is it safe to let people who have been confined in a ship overwhelmed with a deadly virus to leave if they have a negative test? Of course its not.  They should have been taken off the ship 14 days ago and put in hospitals or flown back to their own countries to be quarantined. That is what needs to happen NOW. All of them need to be quarantined again for 14 days and only then if they are still negative should they be allowed to travel freely.
2020-02-19 16:44,Looks like Japan is helping the spread of the coronavirus since they have no clue is some of the people are just coming down with the virus.  Now it can spread around as they fly home.  It seems pretty negligent to me.
2020-02-19 17:00,"I would hope that people will start boycotting Princess Cruise Line for they have handled this crisis on their ship so very poorly and now they are allowing disembarkation without demanding more protocols and quarantines to be put in place to make sure the people leaving will not be taking the virus to all of their home countries. 

By allowing these people to leave their ship under these circumstances is abhorrent.  It makes me feel like they just want to end any more financial responsibility as a result of more passengers showing signs of infection while on board so instead they just want to send them on their way. 

Another good reason to boycott Princess Cruises is, well,  just imagine what is going to happen when all the crew members finish their mandatory  sterilization of the ship and are then dispersed to other Princess Cruise Line ships? Will they be fully tested and quarantined after cleaning the ship? Myself, I doubt it very much. Not after seeing how they handled this debacle. 

I for one will be boycotting Princess Cruises and I will never step foot on one of their ships again."
2020-02-19 16:48,"Each time there is a new case of Coronavirus, the 14 day quarantine resets to zero. This did not happen on the Island Princess. Japan appears to have misunderstood how to effectively quarantine the people on the Cruise ship and just counted fourteen days.
Even though those released tested negative for Coronavirus, this does not mean that they will not get the virus later. They were just exposed to the virus this week.
Japan may have spread the virus around the globe."
2020-02-19 17:31,"‘He acknowledged, though, that after three health ministry officials who had tended to passengers on the ship tested positive for the virus, “I cannot say that things are being controlled completely.”’

‘“The lack of a coordinated response in which genuine experts are responsible for decision making is problematic,” he said,” because what happens instead is that you have political functionaries who are placed in roles of authority beyond their competency. For me, the echoes and analogies with Fukushima are just really disturbing.”’

These two statements say everything about the cruise ship quarantine. We humans never know everything, but clearly some of us are more expert than others. And when non-experts try to manage an epidemic, potentially horrible and probably unnecessary consequences are likely to result."
2020-02-19 17:49,"Just out of curiosity... 

Who pays for the costs of housing the passengers on cruise ship under quarantine? The govt that orders the quarantine or the cruise line ?

Who pays for the the chartered planes cost that brings passengers/ tourists back from Japan/ China? The govt of the country they are evacuating to or the passengers themselves?

Who pays for the 2 week quarantine at the Air Force bases in the US? And lost wages for the persons that are under the quarantine order ?

None of the news articles I could find seem to address these questions."
2020-02-19 16:57,"Most of the people I know are indifferent to what's going on in China (and now other countries in Asia albeit on a much smaller scale). It's just not real to them. I've noticed there have been fewer comments on the Times' articles about COVID-19 recently. A lot of people seem to be getting bored.

Soothing assurances from experts notwithstanding, everything I've read tells me that we're in the land of what Donald Rumsfeld once called ""unknown unknowns"".

I postponed a long standing trip to California that at the end of the month until the late summer -- and I'm staying out of airplanes and other public transportation until (a) we understand this virus better and/or (b) we're sure that the US is going to be spared. 

My guess the US will dodge the bullet this time. But if the virus does hit us, we're simply not prepared for a Chinese style response. 

The tragic Diamond Princess saga  also seems to confirm (a) longer than expected incubation periods, (b) a high probability for transmission in a confined space and (c) general chaos in the official handling of this crisis. 

I am scared."
2020-02-19 18:00,"Wow.  The ""chaotic"" and downright irrational handling of the cruise ship quarantine echoes in some ways the behind-the-scenes mishandling of things in the early days of the Fukushima nuclear plant disaster.  What's going on with Japan's disaster management?  This is far from reassuring, especially with the Japanese Olympics looming."
2020-02-19 17:12,"It appears that the virus has been circulated in China since November 2019.  Now with the virus outbreak(s) on the cruise ships in Asia, it is becoming more obvious the proverbial cat is out of the bag.  

Is it time to move from containment to mitigation or are we too afraid of the economical impacts that such move would create?"
2020-02-19 17:56,"I must say that the Japanese have a terrible record of dealing with emergencies such as this!  Allowing  bureaucrats rather than medical professionals to organize the quarantine on that ship and thereby spread the virus among the passengers the way they did is an outrage.  When the Japanese doctor boarded the ship and was so horrified by the conditions on board, saying that nothing was organized properly to contain the spread of the virus among the passengers, I couldn't believe it.  Seems like the main focus was keeping the passengers off Japanese soil, ramifications for the passengers themselves be damned.  Now Japan is the world's third largest economy - there is simply no excuse for the way they handled this situation and the treatment of the passengers for 2 weeks on board what amounted to a prison ship full of infected passengers is just shocking in every way.  I'm so disappointed and angry at the Japanese government for having dropped the ball as they did, there's no excuse."
2020-02-19 17:36,"China: *Seals off cities.
Rest of the world: this is gross overreaction.
Japan: *Lets people off the boat after two week quarantine.
Rest of the world: this is reckless.

There's just no satisfying some people."

2020-02-19 18:17,"Nothing about this was safe. While it was reported on, the media seemed oddly reserved with respect to expressing concern until now. Even as the number of infected increased daily on that ship, the world seems to shrug. All the focus was on China bashing and highlighting every potential Chinese misstep. I fear that everyone has become so eager to see enemies fail that we are not learning from one another. I fear that there is not enough collaboration. But my greatest fear is that misplaced pride might result in  not following a successful approach because an enemy or rival did it first."
2020-02-19 18:42,"Is it safe?

Yes, if no pandemic develops and this is all just another mild flu.  

No, if a pandemic develops (many millions around the world catch it, some millions need hospitalization, and ~5% of those die).

The trouble is, we can't yet predict which way this will go and therefore it's a reckless move by Japan, Cambodia, and even the US for helping to spread the potential carriers."
2020-02-19 18:17,"All things considered, it is really hard not to see this development as stupid and dangerous.
China is locking up millions, Japan is apparently lax towards a bunch on the luxurious cruise which is a totally obvious breeding ground for covid-19.  What were they thinking?

Fortunately, internationally, the 'freed' people will have to be quarantined again."

2020-02-19 18:36,Another indication this event has exposed global and national infrastructures as a Potemkin Village is that every article written and published on this topic has raised more questions than they have answered.
2020-02-19 18:37,"""443 people had satisfied the terms of a two-week quarantine and let them walk free.""
     This is a very bad decision and does not make sense. To be on the safer side these 443 people should be on quarantine for another two weeks in a Japanese facility before they are discharged to the outside world.
    The Infectious disease specialist from Kobe University had visited the ship and he was describing the conditions in the ship as "" completely chaotic"". He was afraid that he himself might contract the coronavirus while on the ship. 
  Experts have expressed alarm over the quarantine protocols in the ship. 
   The Infectious disease specialist from Australia does not believe that things are being controlled completely and that these passengers should be put in another two weeks quarantine
    Many countries who have their citizens on this ship are not confident that the shipboard quarantine worked, and that more people could later test positive.
    The number of confirmed infections on the ship has reached 621 on Wednesday and 79 new cases have been added.
       In my opinion, the Japanese government is making a rash decision, these people are not safe enough to ride public transport and go home to their families without going through another quarantine."
2020-02-19 18:45,"The passengers should have been allowed to disembark immediately and moved to a quarantine facility in their country.  Given enough time, everyone on the ship would have gotten sick.  That didn’t seem to occur to anyone in authority.

Now passengers are being released who could very well be carrying the virus.  I would not want to be anywhere near them, on a city street - or on an airplane where the interior air is recirculated.

This was a huge mistake by the Japanese.  I fear we will be seeing the deadly results in the weeks to come."
2020-02-19 18:59,Too many of us on this planet now? Pandemic nature will decide.
2020-02-19 18:25,"I'm going to accuse the United States of a political gamesmanship too. The Trump administration is deeply afraid American citizens to dying on a cruise ship in Japan. The passengers might die anyway. However, you can't control the narrative of their death from a quarantined ship somewhere across the world. Bringing the passengers home was almost certainly the wrong decision. However, the Trump administration doesn't want bad optics during an election season. In all likelihood, we are all less safe as a result.

This virus is going to spread. However, the quicker it spreads, the more people will die. The idea is to limit the spread as much as humanly possible. Beginning with Cambodia, world leaders have apparently thrown in the towel. The US and Japan are right there on the same list."
2020-02-19 18:19,"The mistakes were made Day 1: no matter where they had to be moved, the passengers should have been taken off the ship immediately. A cruise ship is not a quarantine environment, not matter what you call it. The fact that hundreds on the ship have become infected was totally predictable.

It's hard to imagine the effects if this were a super-deadly virus like Ebola instead of Coronavirus."
2020-02-19 16:56,So today Japan let cruise passengers from Coronavirus cruise ship Diamond Princess walk free in Yolohama? How safe is that?  We don't have any idea yet how safe we are from the novel Covid-19 virus here in the US.  No point worrying about something we can't control! We're far more worried about the uncontrolled virus of our dangerous presidency in coming months.
2020-02-19 19:34,"I would like to see a graphic showing the cabins/areas where passengers became ill and tested positive.  There could be a lot to learn about transmission from this ship.

also have any of the ill been transferred to ICU care as seen in China?  I don’t recall reading that any passengers required that kind of response.  

clearly the ship was an incubator but it may be  less virulent than Wuhan.  It’s scary but too early to judge the true impact of how this situation was handled."
2020-02-19 20:13,"I lived in rural Japan years ago. I was impressed by how orderly and compliant everyone was. Everybody followed the rules.  It was amazing but also excessive. 

The problem for the Japanese comes when a situation arises which requires innovation.  I was appalled, for example, by the trash on the beaches. When I asked a local teacher why they weren't educating the kids to keep the beaches cleaner, the teacher looked offended: 

""That's not my job,"" he said."
2020-02-19 20:15,"Based on the skyrocketing infection rate on the ship, it is reasonable to assume that perhaps ~25% of the 443 released passengers could be carriers."

All the countries should shut off the air travel out of Japan immediately, as they are doing to China, to stop the virus from spreading further and becoming a true global pandemic.  The US government, please, do it NOW to protect us in the US."
2020-02-19 20:13,"At the risk of angering others in the Infectious Disease world. This is, not to sound unscientific, but absolutely stupid. This is what happens when politics and politicians run science. That ship is Petri dish. You have to show no new infections within a quarantine period for it to be effective. If not you assume continued transmission. This virus is going to start spreading worldwide, by mid April we will see what policies like this and Cambodia have caused. Prime ministers are not Infectious Disease experts. None should be politically appointed. The WHO and CDC are broken. Who is the adult in the room???"

2020-02-19 20:00,"Clearly, this is insane.
We know this is a crafty highly contagious virus that is without doubt about to spread some more from letting people, and their stuff, just waltz off the ship. There have been many who test negative a few times and then test positive. What are the Japanese thinking and where is the WHO with some clear & stringent guidelines??"
2020-02-19 19:38,"Although China's response to the coronavirus was drastic, I strongly prefer an overcautious response to Japan's disorganized quarantine.  The only people the Japanese government seemed to be caring about were its citizens not on-board the cruise ship."
2020-02-19 19:52,"I thought of Japan as a highly competent nation, yet their handling of this crises was so unbelievably inept that my perception has dramatically changed. Telling the passengers out of quarantine that they're now safe to take public transportation???? Truly, truly shocked at Japan's complete lack of even common sense."
2020-02-19 20:06,"I am surprised Japan has no disease control agency.  How can that be in the modern world?  I believe Japan prides itself on having an orderly homogeneous society but that is no defense against biological ""weapons"" such as this coronavirus.

It is good that other countries are requiring the DP passengers to undergo quarantine before entry but there also should have been a quarantine upon disembarkation.  I listened to Mr (Dr?) Iwata's  account of the minimal to no infection control procedures aboard the Diamond Princess and I now understand why the disease spread so widely among the passengers, crew, and Japanese authorities.  Holland America  has a chief medical officer,  Dr Grant Tarling, who had to know what went on aboard DP was wrong.  Why didn't he speak up?"
2020-02-19 20:11,"You left out the part about the ship cutting the passengers out of the internet.  The TVs worked.  The crew was using cell phones;  but the passengers were told the internet is ""down"".  Friends of a friend were on the ship."
2020-02-19 19:30,"I wish there was some kind of international treaty that said that if the WHO determined something to be a pandemic, they would get called in to manage the whole process. This DIY method from country to country isn’t working."
2020-02-19 19:30,"The Japanese government doesn’t have an agency that deals with infectious diseases?

I have been reading that they have cases popping up with no connection to China and now all these cruise ship passengers are walking their streets. This does not bode well for the rest of the world. Wish they would have moved that ship back to China and they could have quarantined everyone there. There may be no Olympics this year.

Please Carnival do the world a favor: Give refunds and cancel cruises. Disinfect and park those boats for the time being."
2020-02-19 20:08,"Seems to me that the Japanese government ran a calculation and decided that the on-going PR nightmare of a ""disease ship"" parked in Yokohama Harbor was worse than the fallout from sending potentially infectious individuals back to their home countries...  They want that ship and the media attention gone."
2020-02-19 20:17,"Well-intentioned mistakes are still mistakes. The fact is that quarantines are hard to execute... people get antsy, and foreign governments breathe down your neck about their citizens. Biological agents do not forgive. We may be seeing the beginning of a massive and out-of-control worldwide pandemic."
2020-02-19 19:59,"I am glad that people won’t be trapped on the ship, with more and more getting sick, soon. But why does the CDC still say our US cases are 15? Surely with 14 Diamond Princess cases added on, the number should have gone up to 29? And I heard on the radio last night there was at least 1 more. But I don’t see any news of this? Also, some articles indicated the tests sent to states might be flawed and had to be returned? Are reporters asking the CDC questions about all this?"
2020-02-19 19:32,"Why does it take special expertise to understand that you aren’t cleared of suspicion of carrying a virus until you have been isolated from exposure to it for longer than the incubation period?
People on the cruise ship could have been exposed yesterday. And judging from the report from the doctor in this article, they probably were. And now they go about their business, touching fruit at the grocery store, sneezing in line at the bank..."
2020-02-19 19:55,"I fear the real reason is we are not being told the whole story . An infectious viral outbreak is difficult to control no matter what . People will disobey or break quarantine protocols either thru ignorance or a sense of self preservation . We will see more cases here in the U.S. and around the world , just a matter of time ."
2020-02-19 20:34,"Looks like, due to these choices, Japan will be the next big outbreak center.  Are they willing to take the same economy-crushing steps at containment that Wuhan is?
Every day, a new list of delayed test results will come back (like happened with the US evacuees), and they'll realize a new bunch of 20-50 per day of the released cruise passengers thought healthy were actually infected within the last few days, then scramble to try to find who've they've infected since riding the subway home."
2020-02-19 20:39,"Based on the German experience published the New England Journal of Medicine this is clearly not safe. Approximately 10 of them will test positive using a 2 week quarantine period in a high risk exposure conditions such as those existing on that cruise ship. Of course, these are tangential interpretations of limited data available."
2020-02-19 20:29,"So, what would you do with thousands of folks who are mostly foreigners, likely to get infected if not already infected, and will inundate your medical system with little or no compensation?  

Declare them ""safe"" and send them on their way out of your country."
2020-02-19 20:30,"My question is to NYT? You reported about China in  great  detail and its missteps, and why you  did not report about Japan  and its missteps in this virus  containment with same rigor. Japan needs  to account  for its mistakes."
2020-02-19 20:32,""" Japan declared on Wednesday that 443 people had satisfied the terms of a two-week quarantine and let them walk free.""
     The coronavirus infection should be taken seriously and these 443 people should be kept on quarantine for an additional two weeks in a facility in Japan before being released.
     The coronavirus is spreading at an alarming rate in China much more quickly than the SARS. Dr. W.Ian Lipkin known as a ""master virus hunter"" who helped fight the SARS outbreak in an interview with Anderson Cooper of CNN was saying that the coronavirus is highly transmissible than the flu virus or SARS.
     The lab test for COVID-19 is also new. There are deep concerns laboratory tests are incorrectly telling people they are free of the coronavirus. Stories in several countries suggest people are having up to six negative results before finally being diagnosed
       A study in the Journal of Radiology ( Radiological Society of North America) published recently showed five out of 167 patients tested negative for the disease by the lab tests despite lung scans showing they were ill. They then tested positive for the virus at a later date. What more can be done? CT scans,? they are expensive with radiation hazards.
    We know very little about COVID-19 because it's so new. This means COVID-19 is something of a wild card in terms of how far it will spread and how many deaths it will cause. This illness should be taken seriously."
2020-02-19 20:28,"There is no one at the helm in America and apparently in Japan who is attempting to stop this utter horrific incompetence and its deadly consequences.  

Where are the adults who are supposed ""leaders"" in our world?

Every person who walked off that ship needs to immediately be tracked down, quarantined and interrogated as to where they've been, who they were with and so forth since they walked off that ship!!"
2020-02-19 20:30,"You'd think that the way to do a quarantine would be that none leaves the ship until no new cases have been reported for the full incubation duration (14 days).
Harsh, but if you're doing a quarantine it is worse to do it halfway since you end up not controlling the infection but still impose significant hardship on the quarantined."
2020-02-19 20:41,"The Diamond Princess has been an incubating Petrie dish for the coronavirus for the last 14 days, and Japanese officials are solely responsible for 620 of the 621 confirmed infections on board the ship. If my recollection serves me correctly, a single passenger with the virus was removed from the ship two weeks ago and since then 620 other cases have developed.

To make matters exponentially worse, those same officials are now releasing 443 people from the ship based on the results of tests which may or may not be definitive at the moment.

I am appalled by the utter stupidity and recklessness of those officials, who represent a country I once thought to be unquestionably sophisticated and of sound judgment."
2020-02-19 21:01,"Wouldn’t it have been better to quarantine the passengers separately, rather than together on a ship? Expensive, but considering the stakes, it seems worth it."
2020-02-19 16:45,"This seems short-sighted of the Japanese and reflects a potential lack of understanding about how viruses, quarantines, and incubation periods work.

The biggest issue: The virus seems to be spreading on the cruise ship. As such, there could be people who were infected *less than* 14 days ago who haven't developed the infection yet. There could also be people who have it but are asymptomatic but still contagious.

The reality: A true quarantine can't really happen on a cruise ship. The passengers need to be isolated from the general population and also from each other -- no shared air, and serious thought to not spreading disease when delivering food and other necessities from room to room."
2020-02-19 16:43,"I, too, am an infectious diseases physician, and the description in the article convinces me that not only were the workers on the ship disseminating the virus, the so-called experts were doing the same. It sounds like a completely chaotic horror show.

There are strict protocols for donning and doffing protective gear. Done incorrectly, it is easy to self-contaminate. And it seems that the ship's staff were not in fully protective gear anyway, which would include, full body suit, booties, face protection, and head protection.  In addition, it seems from a just-published paper that asymptomatic individuals are capable of spreading infection. The end of this virus is nowhere in sight, in my opinion."
2020-02-19 19:28,"Hmm...

On a ship that had ONE infected passenger who disembarked in Hong Kong over two weeks ago, nearly one in six people are now known to be infected. All of them presumably being exposed directly and indirectly over the past two weeks, from that one initial person.

And now Japan has somehow determined it's safe to turn loose thousands of people who could've been infected at any point over the past two weeks but are yet to show signs of the virus' presence. Those people will be on buses, trains, and planes as well as in stores and restaurants and if even ONE caries the disease, they have the potential to expand the infected population exponentially among the public they come in contact with. After all, this entire cruise's mess started with just that one person.

I try not to be an alarmist, but geez. This just seems like it could be unleashing a disaster on the world that will be far more widespread than it is currently. Astonishing!"
2020-02-19 18:04,"Is that safe? Simple math provides the answer. No. The initial outbreak started with a very small number of people infected with a virus that (according to the best, current intelligence) originated with a species of bat, spread to a transfer host - possibly a pangolin - and then on to humans. If the early diagnosis had been acted upon properly we would not be currently talking about thousands dead, many more sick, and hundreds of billions of dollars in economic losses.

At every step along the way a combination of perceived short-term interests and stupidity blocked a prudent response. Keeping thousands of people cooped up in a confined area such as cruise ships and then letting them wander away (as in Cambodia and, now, Japan) is an expression of that insanity. 

Why weren't these populations broken up into much smaller, manageable quarantine units where the risk of spreading the infection within the quarantined group was reduced to something close to zero? Keeping them on the cruise ships has been crazy. Letting them now wander off is even crazier.

Merely because the incubation period is two weeks that doesn't prevent someone who has spent the last two weeks on the Diamond Princess from having acquired the infection yesterday, showing no symptoms today, and spreading the disease in two weeks time as they now move without restrictions among unprotected populations.

How hard is that to figure out? People are now paying for this idiocy with their lives."
2020-02-19 18:01,"I don't envy the people quarantined, the crew members, or the officials in charge of containing the virus. One need only look at all the differing opinions and perspectives of the experts to realize that a universally agreed upon protocol doesn't exist. Obviously an amateur here, but the ship just seemed like a worsening situation. I wish they could have removed them from the start to an isolated military base. Get them out of that environment and provide support in a more controlled location with trained staff and a sterile (if that's possible) start. The news about the virus is scary...I think a lot of us are just waiting for confirmation it has jumped."
2020-02-19 19:21,"Cruise ships are closed floating temporary housing where the same air circulates unless you are on the open decks. Whose fault is it that there were passengers who were allowed in with Corona infection to spread it to other passengers? Once inside  a cruise ship whose fault is it to contain the infection from spreading to uninfected passengers? How long is an infected person exposing others to the infection? How meaningful is a 2 -week quarantine in a closed environment? Not much if within a 2-week period uninfected persons are continually infected. 

So what is my answer to loaded question about Japan letting passengers walk free after a 2-week quarantine. Japan was confronted by a very complex situation. Thankfully it did a humanitarian step that allowed the cruise ship to stay docked in its port and allowed those not infected to leave the ship knowing that they could be positive  in the future. Freedom to walk free from a ship with Corona virus infected passengers was certainly risky but with so many unknowns they did the right thing and any one faulting the Japanese authorities don't have valid reasons to be critical of a situation they are not in a position to judge. 

CDC experts from ATL are expressing alarm over the protocols on the ship. My question to CDC is are you going to evacuate the 621 confirmed cases of which 12 persons could die and treat them optimally in hospitals? Can the CDC say for sure that those who walked free may or may not be carrying the virus?"
2020-02-19 21:12,Did anybody become critically ill or die of Covid-19 on any of the luxury liners?
2020-02-19 20:55,"My simple thoughts, the olympics are now at risk, tragic"
2020-02-19 20:55,"Japan is clearly following China's initial response; ""not our problem""."
2020-02-19 21:13,"I read about one woman who self quarantined  and it was like wow how amazing she is! Is it really that hard for people to understand the situation, quarantine themselves and protect others?"
2020-02-19 21:23,Are the Japanese just giving up on containment? The Germans found that 2 of 114 people that initially screened negative later tested positive for the virus and their samples tested as infectious in caco cell assay. So they were without symptoms and were infectious. Very worrisome that there is reportedly community transmission ongoing in Japan before this news. It is very unlikely that the released passengers have zero infectious people in the group.
2020-02-19 21:06,Two questions I don't see much on.  First I see all kinds of cruise ads on tv and social media.  Is anyone at all booking now and are all the people with refundable trips on cruises canceling?  Second are people cancelling reservations for the Tokyo Olympics yet or were the reservations all nonrefundable?
2020-02-19 21:08,"Quite simply the Japanese government is making a bet that the virus detection procedure has a 0% false negative rate. Not being an epidemiologist I cannot judge how good a bet that is, but it is a daring one for a virus that was unknown to the medical community about two months ago.  It is apparent that the quarantine procedures aboard ship were a shambles. This seems to be the real purpose of releasing ostensibly virus-free persons to roam the country. Keeping them on board no longer was protecting them."
2020-02-19 21:21,"On a serious note; in the matter of so many testing positive but are asymptomatic, are we fully certain of the test? I don't wish to interject a lack of confidence, but perhaps the protocols and science should be peer reviewed extensively in light of the extraordinary circumstances this disease is presenting.

More specifically about the cruise ships; I'm reminded of the scene in the movie ""Jaws"" in which the marketing minded mayor of Amity Island roams the beach trying to assure the sunbathers it's safe to go back in the water."
2020-02-19 21:38,"Besides Japan, I'm also shocked by the lack of authority and action by WHO.  If the WHO is not ready and capable of taking charge and methodically organizing activities in a situation like this, then it speaks to a failure of one of its core missions as a world governing body.  When the crises is over (one can only hope), lessons should be learned and changes should be made asap."
2020-02-19 22:20,My father passed away in the hospital during the sars epidemic. Not directly from the virus but from the isolation. No visits were allowed. Unforseen casualty! He lost the will to live.
2020-02-19 22:46,"It makes very little difference what anyone does. It seems that it is quite contagious, and thus it is unlikely to be stopped. However, there is actually no evidence that it is any more deadly than a typical influenza. At this moment people are a bit hyper aware of the deaths but totally lost on just how many people have contracted it. It is my contention that the numbers of ill are way higher in China because most people there would not seek a doctors help. They would ride it out like most generally healthy people do with a flu. If I catch it I will take some tylenol and drink lots of liquids, and maybe be cognizant of whether I develop any breathing/lung issues, and if so, at that point would seek medical attention. Just like any old generally healthy person should."
2020-02-19 21:57,"Along with everything else stated here about the obvious insane decision to let people off without further quarantine...I keep coming back to the 14 days that everyone seems to be in agreement upon as the right amount of time in a more general manner. Is it? Do we know this for certain? Is this merely an educated guess as so much is? If so, many more warnings need to be in place for those getting off quarantine and possibly longer quarantines. This virus is a monster, one we must do everything in our powers to keep at bay. The WHO should be offering up stringent wise guidelines to everyone, say cruise ship owners and governments, and yet, so much is lacking in good advice it seems. Everyone is more concerned about the economy, about China, about sowing panic....Let us please keep public health - the desire to keep people worldwide from getting very sick and dying - at the front of all decision making. Everything else is secondary."
2020-02-19 22:29,"Are you watching this drama unfold, Stephen King? This would make a great fiction novel, a real horror story. Getting stuck on a cruise ship is bad enough, but this is stranger than life."
2020-02-19 22:37,"It's about time for NY Times to get ready to compare the COVID-19 to the H1N1 outbreak, trace the development, how governments deal differently with the spread, the fatality, etc. Already several reputable news outlets are doing it. Let's shine the light on how governments around the world should be prepared to deal with the next one."
2020-02-19 21:35,"With the deaths in Iran and the dispersal of passengers from the cruise ship fiascos in Japan and Cambodia, it is quite possible that COVID-19 is already circulating in the populations here and in Europe, or is about to. With that in mind, five days ago the CDC announced a surveillance program for COVID-19. In five cities (LA, SF, Seattle, Chicago and NY), any patients with respiratory disease who tested negative for flu (officially at near-epidemic levels) would now be tested for this coronavirus. Surely some results for that surveillance should now be available. Will they be publicized? In the face of a possible pandemic, will information be shared with the public or kept from us to avoid causing panic? Are there any restrictions now applying on the NYT and other media that were triggered by this public health event? I assume such restrictions would be unconstitutional but I know that, as in the case of shouting ""fire"" in a crowded theater, free speech has some limits to protect public health."
2020-02-19 21:47,"Remember how the Japanese Government mishandled the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster in 2011?  Does that give you a lot of confidence in their ability to safely and competently handle the quarantine of this deadly virus?

All too often, the Japanese Government has shown itself to be more intent on saving face than in saving lives . . ."
2020-02-19 22:14,"I have family living in Japan and I am distressed to see that the authorities have seemingly opened the floodgates releasing these cruise ship passengers. 
Just a few people with infections can quite literally start an epidemic where there was none. 
I fear for my family but I fear for all the folks in Japan. I have been to Japan twice and observed how clean the country is and really thought it would be a leader in the coronavirus fight. 
Extremely disappointed, to say the least. 
Wish my daughter and family would come back to the states until this virus is in hand on the continent of Asia. I don't care if I seem overzealous. I am worried."
2020-02-19 22:45,"There have been outbreaks of migratory communicable illnesses before -- SARS, Ebola... This is no one's first rodeo, as they say. 

I'm incredulous that the W.H.O. (who look like nothing more than a bunch of ineffective bureaucrats) doesn't publish and disseminate protocols for situations like this. Right now, every country is developing its own guidelines, often on the fly. There's no uniformity of action, which can only end badly. 

Infectious disease experts should take the lead on communicating best practices. I recall the C.D.C.'s dogged work during the beginning of the AIDS epidemic. Though their Director spoke recently, I know from a cousin who used to work there that a lot of high-caliber personnel left during an era of de-funding. This is the logical result -- a global health emergency, and no one in charge."
2020-02-19 22:19,Not looking good for Tokyo Olympic that’s coming up in a few months
2020-02-19 22:03,"First: This is about class! With the Cruise Ship Company being forced to maintain responsibility for something they couldn't handle. So the rich passengers were confined — the poor crew were made to keep WORKING! Circulating around the ship and interacting with each other and the passengers!

But at the beginning if the ship was the isolation site then BOTH passengers and crew should have been confined with a haz-mat equipped team from off the ship delivering food and medicine. 

Better still everyone on the ship should have been taken off the ship and quarantined immediately upon arrival in a place similar to the places in California where the Wuhan evacuees were kept, large, spacious, comfortable, isolated and observed by professionals.

Second it's about the OLYMPICS! Japanese bureaucrats wanted to keep the number of infected in Japan in the low double digits so they refused to allow anyone of the ship and in every press conference kept insisting that the ships numbers be kept separate from the Japanese numbers. They made decisions based on appearances and technicalities and not science or medical practice!

They kept headlines world wide on this ship and have now unleashed infected tourists to travel through the Tokyo transportation hubs. The results are obvious. They incubated the virus and then turned it loose.

No one will want to travel to the Olympics now because of the way these foreign travelers were treated by the Japanese government."
2020-02-19 21:34,"Did the Japanese make a mistake?
The Japan Times English newspaper reports:
""The evacuation began Wednesday of a cruise ship quarantined after an outbreak of new coronavirus COVID-19, with several hundred passengers who had tested negative being allowed to leave the ship.
 About 500 individuals, most of them elderly, disembarked from the Diamond Princess on Wednesday. Many of them took chartered buses provided by the city to Yokohama Station, while others hailed taxis or were collected by family members.""
"" At the Diet, policymakers continued to debate whether the quarantine should have been lifted and if passengers should have been isolated after they disembarked.""
During a Lower House Budget Committee meeting Wednesday, opposition party members criticized the health ministry for lifting the quarantine even as cases of infection continue to be reported aboard the ship almost every day.
  Kazunori Yamanoi, an opposition party member, questioned whether passengers should be allowed to return home, go shopping and go about with their lives.  “If any of those 500 individuals are infected, we won’t be able to contain it,”"
2020-02-19 23:07,"Given the high rate of transmission in such a tightly controlled environment as Diamond Princess, we might just accept the fact that COVID-19 will become endemic. Even if the staff of the ship didn't take highest level of precautions when distributing meals, they were clearly more vigilant than ordinary food servers in regions that are heavily impacted by the virus. With any luck, the virus will maintain its relatively light lethality until a vaccine gets developed. It seems totally unrealistic to keep millions of people in quarantine for an indefinite period of time. 

In the meantime, the Chinese authorities should use all their might to make sure that wet markets will never spread another novel virus."
2020-02-19 23:09,"Successfully managing new and extraordinarily challenging situations such as Coronavirus on a cruise ship - i.e. amped up crisis management - requires strong leadership, technical experts and some smart creative thinkers who have the ear of the leader & who the technical experts know are as valuable as they to devising an optimal solution."

I think, I will still go to Japan for the Olympics but simply avoid Tokyo and the crowds.

There is a lot to do and see in Japan.  The NYT had carried a story about Fukushima advertising it as a tourist destination.

Having been to Chernobyl - with nuclear contamination - hard to believe Wuhan virus will thrive in Fukushima.

Might be the safest place to go during the Olympics.

As an aside, I have never liked cruises - the last one to Antarctica - a 21 day cruise - made me decide - never again on a cruise.

Wuhan virus and these stories has hit the final nail in that coffin."

It looks like some form of political Seppuku on TV. Should predictions come true and the virus spread from this ship  further into Tokyo, Japan and the World...PM Shinzo Abe might have to resign."
2020-02-19 23:20,"As a Tokyo resident this is a scary situation. News interviewed a Japanese couple who left the ship and returned to Kyoto. They said that they don’t want to be a burden on society and would do two weeks self-quarantine at home. That is great news.

Then on Twitter an American on board the Diamond Princess says he is leaving the ship today and will spend the next two weeks exploring Tokyo. 

All we can do is be careful of washing our hands, try not to touch our face, and try to eat healthful foods to help our immune system."
2020-02-19 23:56,"As an infectious diseases physician I must add my recommendation to that already made by my colleages;  let the Carnival Cruise Line, the Holland-American Line, and their sister cruise ship lines, which own over 50% of the world's cruise ships, re-name their palatial ships. What about the ""Coronavirus"", the ""Norovirus"", the ""COVID-19"", the ""Wuhan"", etc? And let us not forget the most clever name of all: the ""Asymptomatic Princess"".

2020-02-20 0:31,"How many times have we heard of illnesses on cruise ships? It's an ideal breeding ground with thousands on one ship. I'm reminded of the TV show ""The Love Boat"". I'll bet it was on A.B.C."
2020-02-20 0:40,"I dont know if its safe to let them go, but it's definitely right. These people arent prisoners. To expose them to a closed ventilation system is to almost guarantee that they all will become infected. If more quarantine were needed, they should be sent to a hospital for observation. Contrast this with the outrage against public officials who wanted to restrict the travel of people exposed to Ebola, a far more lethal and infectious illness. Oh, but cruise passengers are privileged westerners, so that makes detention ok."
2020-02-20 0:41,"I understand that Japan does have people with the expertise to manage the problem. 

And I am shocked that they didn't use it in this case to manage the passengers during the the quarantine. Essentially, they didn't create a quarantine. You do not release a quarantine when there is evidence of active illness on a ship."
2020-02-20 0:26,The summer olympics in Japan are doomed!
2020-02-20 0:44,"Having the crew remain on the ship, to disinfect the ship, is absolute abuse of mostly poor people."

This is the start if the next great tragedy."
2020-02-20 0:31,"The Princess Line should rename the Diamond Princess the ""Petri Princess."""
2020-02-20 0:38,"Let me clarify something, Diamond Princess’ port of registry is London and the owner is Carnival Corporation & plc of Doral, Florida. This means the ship operates under British law at sea and the management is American.

The ship was in Japanese water on Feb 4th when 10 passengers was diagnosed with COVID-19 and the ship was put into quarantine in Yokohama. 

If you want to play the blame game as so many people are doing, the management is American and they did not handle the quarantine correctly as evidenced."
2020-02-20 1:21,"I cannot help but ask the previous commenters, those who I am assuming are reacting out of fear for their own health and would prefer that infected and uninfected passengers alike remain in this unsanitary, arguably dehumanizing environment, why does your life, your comfort and privilege matter more than others'? Does contracting or becoming exposed to a disease render a person less than human? Should said people be punished and exiled? Historically, many people, including those suffering from leprosy, HIV, and AIDS have been treated with less humanity than the Japanese government has so graciously been willing to extend to these coronavirus victims, not villains."
2020-02-20 1:24,"I have compassion for those who might be exposed or infected by the coronavirus.  



As perspective, however, many of those evacuated have arrived here in San Antonio at Lackland AFB,

I note that many local politicians and citizens seem to have more fear and anxiety about this “caravan” of travelers arriving by air than any putative caravan crossing the Rio Grande.  These “visitors” to Lackland are potential carriers of disease who are being released from “custody” without assurance they are benign to the rest of the population.  

And those who have such fear note that a wall won’t protect us from those with diseases at the AFB."
2020-02-20 1:25,This was the wrong decision.  It will come back to haunt them!
2020-02-20 1:24,"Most folks are worried of the cases we know, like the ones on the cruise ship. But what about the thousands who left Wuhan or other infected places via other modes before the lockdown?

I think the horse has bolted and its no use closing the barn door now. The best you can hope for is that you don't catch the bug this year and get a vaccine shot for next."
2020-02-20 1:33,"Who is responsible for the health and well being of the passengers legally? Is it the US government, the boat owner, or the Japanese government? The Japanese epidemiologist who entered the ship yesterday or the day before claimed that it was very poorly handled inside -that it wasn't clear where was a safe space and where infected passengers had been and he said therefore he was terrified to be there. But who has control over that situation? Is it the Japanese or the owner or the US. My wife is Japanese and I live in Japan. I was ready to put the blame on the Japanese but she suggested that Abe is weak these days and also has poor communication with the US government via Trump and thus things did not get done correctly. Is this more evidence of the impairment of US relations with its allies and further is the situation inside the ship the responsibility of the ship owner or the Japanese government or the US government legally? My guess is that Trump more or less ignored the situation after closing the borders to visitors arriving from China (which I applaud). My guess is that if Obama had been president the situation would have been far more organized and the outcomes better."
2020-02-20 1:39,"Given that there is no aspect of Japanese life is free of bureaucratic interference, and that most bureaucrats graduate from the departments of law at select, elite universities and go directly into the ministries without specialist training, knowledge, or experience, it's not surprising at all that they are responsible for creating what was essentially a disease incubator. Their primary concern was to limit the spread of disease to the Tokyo region, home to 30-odd million people - which they managed to do. Thus passengers were quarantined in place largely without regard to their individual or collective welfare, while protocols that should have been followed to stop the spread of the disease to those on shore were flouted out of ignorance."
2020-02-20 1:32,The handling of this situation by the Japanese bureaucracy confirms to me that former Nissan chairman Carlos Ghosn made the right decision to extract himself from systemic incompetence.
2020-02-20 1:34,"It's almost like the goal of keeping everyone prisoner on that cruise ship in Japan, was to wait until all of them were sick. They couldn't have planned it better, anyway. Somebody must have finally realized the utter futility of confining a large group of people together, while a new virus spreads....There are many reasons to avoid cruise ships, and this is just one more."
2020-02-20 1:43,"Based on my own experience living in Japan and having observed their bureaucrats operating, I can say they are very bad at improvising when circumstances demand it. What we have observed here seems to confirm that mindset and approach as has been stated by others, including experts outside officialdom. We can only hope the consequences of this will not be severe."
2020-02-20 1:49,"I'm puzzled why Japan didn't find facilities to take the passengers off the cruise ship and quarantine them at the outset.  Asking cruise ship crews, which consist to some extent of barely literate workers from world's poorest nations, to care for passengers without spreading the virus is nuts.  They are one of the most advanced nations on Earth, and keep their cities immaculate compared to ours, but it seems like they whiffed on how to handle these passengers."
2020-02-20 1:56,The people on the ship have been living in a disease incubator that could not have been designed better to support continuous contagion. Some people who walked off the ship will be infected. Living on a cruise ship is in no way a quarantine where people are effectively separated from each other for a period of time.
2020-02-20 2:12,Why were they let out?
2020-02-20 2:31,"I've been on a half dozen cruises or so and never been sick on one, though I can tell you that it would be hideous to be confined to one of the tiny rooms for even one day.  It's obviously a risk, but there's also a risk of getting sick riding in planes, trains, or buses, but you don't hear about those because you're off the plane, train, or bus before you've properly incubated your newly acquired infection.  Then there's school, work or going to the store.  Thankfully, if you acquire the corona virus in any of those venues, you won't be tortured onboard a ship at least."
2020-02-20 2:51,"We have a novel virus that spreads easily and can be asymptomatic.  ""Novel"" means theoretically no one can escape becoming ill.  

Of course quarantine needed to restart every time a new infection was identified.  Add to that, having a crew in close living quarters preparing and serving food was a ridiculous recipe for failure, since they would naturally be more likely to become ill and infect more passengers.

There was never any perfect way to handle this.  Getting people separated into smaller groups and having each group serve as its own quarantine group would have allowed at least a proportion of those on board to be properly vetted and released.  Between this and the boat that docked in Cambodia I suspect the time for shutting the barn door is long past.

In a situation like this, quarantine really serves to protect those not already exposed.  I'd expect that the best we can really hope for globally is to slow the rate of infection so as not to overwhelm medical facilities - that's the only way to reduce fatalities."
2020-02-20 3:01,"So we know that asymptomatic people can transmit the virus. This means that all these people leaving the ship are potential carriers of the virus and may in turn transmit the virus to anyone they come in contact with. How would you like to be on a plane across the Pacific with one of these people? 

What hasn’t been answered: how effective are the tests? Will the tests catch an asymptomatic carrier? Are the tests easy to accurately administer?"
2020-02-20 2:58,"We have now had people from this ship taken to an infectious disease hospital in San Antonio, 24 hours or so, after they arrived at Lackland AF Base.

I long for the days of real leadership and people who put science first."
2020-02-20 3:10,"I always learn new facts when I read the NYT comments section! But how disappointing to read that Japanese bureaucrats were in charge of the Diamond Princess cruise ship's ""quarantine"" of COVID-19 patients rather than medical experts.  Even accepting that diseases spread quickly in a ship's confined quarters e.g. the norovirus diarrhoea, it is alarming that appropriate medical expertise was not employed in this instance.  Also where was the British and US owners/managers' input into the management of this issue and duty of care to their passengers?

Australians that have been evacuated by our government from Wuhan and the ship have had to undergo a further 14 days quarantine period in either an off-shore detention facility or an unused miners village on the mainland before being allowed to return home.  The result is positive cases in Australia are under 15. 

It just shows that even a seemingly sophisticated and highly developed nation such as Japan is hamstrung by its culture (bureaucratic pre-eminence) rather than edified by science."
2020-02-20 5:50,"I live in Yokosuka, not too far from Yokohama, and am appalled at the fact infectious disease experts haven't been handling this dangerous situation. To let people off the ship after testing them several days before is insane. However, this isn't surprising to me, having lived and worked in this country for more than three years now. As was stated in the article, there are many examples of Japan's poor handling of natural disasters. I had a glimpse of that after experiencing several typhoons.  I'm heading back to the States in the Spring. It can't happen soon enough. I just hope I can stay free of Coronavirus before I leave."
2020-02-20 6:11,"It appears most western media rely on limited information on the situation in Japan, taking one YouTube post that went viral at face value. The person who criticized the handling of the Diamond Princess is indeed an infection specialist, but is also someone who tends to exaggerate things, had grunts for not being asked to be part of the control team, and spent only two hours on the ship and was asked to leave as he was confusing people offering his opinions that was not his role. There have been quite strong argument against the post (some facts but not realistic and others factual mistakes such as the situation is not dealt by experts.) The government, including another infection specialist in charge of the control acknowledge that the measures were not perfect, however, pointed out that perfect control is not possible in the midst of emergency with almost 4000 people on board and the need to deal with the situation in the given set up, against a virus we do not fully understand yet. The post was removed by the owner as was acknowledged in his own press conference."
2020-02-20 6:20,"I thought the way a quarantine should work is that everybody gets to leave when everybody on board was virus free for at least 14 days.  With the virus apparently raging freely thru the ship it would seem that every day of the past 14 there was a dozen or two new cases.  I’m also not sure why everyone wasn’t taken off the ship and quarantined  in separate rooms.  Group quarantine, with all support from untrained ship crew seems a total mistake."
2020-02-20 6:42,"Unfortunately this has been very badly mishandled and allowing hundreds of potentially infected people to scatter, was a grave error. Given that Dr. Fauci and other experts have concluded the entire ship was a hot spot as bad as Wuhan, means that containment is now probably lost. If it was not already. If China has actually contained the epidemic there, highly improbable, but if so, then soon they will be closing their borders to prevent it coming back."
2020-02-20 7:31,"If you want to get deathly ill, take a cruise especially with Princess Cruise Lines. My mother and I took a cruise to Hawaii from San Francisco on Princess and we paid hundreds of dollars for extra insurance. We both came down with bacterial infections, norovirus and ended up in the hospital. The infection spread to my appendix and it had to be removed with emergency surgery. In the hospital the nurse told me they get people from the cruise ships all the time. The cherry on top was when the cruise insurance refused to pay the bills we received on board and were supposed to be covered. Never again."
2020-02-20 8:19,"I went on my first cruise ever this past summer and loved it.   I've been on a few others since then (Caribbean and Panama Canal) and was excited to do more.  Oh well, it was good while it lasted.   Time to try something else."
2020-02-20 10:14,"I was born in Yokohama, spending the first 20 years of my life there. so I am more than a little astonished as the laxity of quarantine.  It was not always thus.  I remember well the case of a  Canadian cruise ship quarantined and not allowed to dock (it stayed just inside Tokyo Harbor for almost a month) when a passenger aboard contracted Cholera and died.  To my knowledge not a single passenger or crew member was allowed to leave the ship the entire time.  Because the dead passenger was buried at sea, no swimming in the sea was also permitted the entire time."
2020-02-20 3:58,My initial question is why did individuals choose to leave on this cruise when they were aware of the global situation already evident?
2020-02-20 6:08,"If anything good can come of this is that it serves as a wake-up call for all nations to have a plan.  With the right conditions and/or nefarious intentions, it could be so much worse."
2020-02-20 7:57,"Huge mistake the Japanese government are making. With the infections clearly occurring during the “quarantine” period, and early stage infections not being picked up by tests, this is a huge blunder by Japan. Thankfully most countries are imposing their own more stringent and tightly controlled quarantine arrangements. Japan however will be hit especially hard, considering the effect Covid-19 is having on the elderly. Very sad."
2020-02-20 8:24,"This situation revealed that Japan's Abe government cannot consider about worst case. besides,they often deceive society or world to make situation show optimistic and to conceal lack of their ability.
They dominate bureaucrats including judges or prosecutors through personnel affair, this self-righteous government's failure is directly linked to lost of whole country. 
but present Abe government never take responsibility whatever they cause.
They have learned nothing from failure of themselves or Chinese authorities,and exploits social unrest to try to build autocratic authority.
It destroy independence between administration and judicature,and can build autocratic situation that person of government and ruling party are never arrested and never punished whatever they do anything.

China, and Japan,
overconfident regime who cling to strengthen authority worsen situation."
2020-02-20 5:30,"I have just read the transcript from a Japanese infection control specialist who barely managed to get on that ship (they kept finding excuses not to let him aboard) before being kicked off again.

The conditions he found were horrendous in that there was no quarantine whatsoever, no separation between the sick and the healthy, no precautions taken  with surface virus transmission as items were passed around, masks and gloves rendered useless due to improper procedure, crew itself sick with fever, and the medical staff was no better protected.

The specialist, who had worked with diseases like Ebola without fear because he knew what safety measures to take,  was terrified during this brief inspection
due to the total chaos on board, and is now self-quarantining himself in case he has picked up the virus."
2020-02-20 10:24,"This is an international failure to prevent the spread of this illness. The passengers on this ship should have been quarantined effectively off the ship from the get go. Now, after the failed quarantine they should not be released to spread this dangerous disease. They should now be put in an  effective quarantine. I fear this will be be seen as the most significant failure to stop the spread of this disease."
2020-02-20 4:04,"Japan has proven the Cruise ship had been a good incubator for the virus which had infected 1/3 of passengers and crews. In addition, there are many none symptomatic flu carrier will be spread around the world for additional round of new infection."
2020-02-20 6:26,"We have been on four fabulous cruises on Regents.
I was ill on every cruise at some time on all of them.
Just being close to folks, and having our butler ill and he
gave me his cold or flu...I will never ever do a cruise again. 
Ever ever again."
2020-02-20 7:21,It is difficult to know what to think about this disease.  No cases in Africa despite 1 million Chinese Belt & Road and other workers.  Virtually no cases in India.  Only two known cases in Iran both of whom died whereas a mortality rate of 2% suggests another 100 or so are undiagnosed.  Really odd
2020-02-20 10:45,"Japan does “... not have a government agency that specializes in disease control”, but they have a Vice-health Minister?
Sounds like a contradiction."
2020-02-20 5:09,"Japanese Abe Govt increased foreign travelers but had lacked enough preparations against infection disease.
They spend immense tax and political resource to buy costly military equipment,on the other hand,they had reduced budget of staff about countermeasure against infection disease.

Japanese conceit prime minister and arrogant chief cabinet secretary repeat that ""our behavior is always proper"".
Japanese health minister and ministry still try to make risk or spread of infection show small.
They prioritize to defend the face of prime minister than health of people,could not change policy about Corona virus,and had increased latent infected people.
Japanese Abe Govt who want autocratic power have repeated failure like China.
Japan became second epicenter of Corona virus clearly.
Even ""official"" number of domestic patients except cruise ship passenger in Japan is largest next to China.

Japanese Abe Govt don't say clearly what they can or cannot,what is possible or impossible.
They still repeat ""proper"" about everything of their behavior to Corona virus But Canada,US,South Korea,Hong Kong,Australia have re-quarantined passengers more 14 days in their countries.
it show that Japan's countermeasure is not enough."
2020-02-20 6:18,"Japanese Abe Govt had prioritized revenue from Chinese travelers and consideration to Chinese Govt than citizen's health and safety.
Until a few days before,Such Govt of host country of Olympics 2020 had restricted range of Corona virus inspection with considering influence to tourism and Olympics.
It is only ""person who came from Wuhan"" and ""person who spent hours with person who came from Wuhan"".
This policy had increased many latent patients in Japanese society.
Even people who feel subjective symptom could not inspect that they are Corona virus carrier or not by Abe Govt's policy.
it delayed treatment and had caused first victim.
therefore,""official"" number of Corona virus patients in Japan is understated.

Countermeasures of Abe Govt of Japan against Corona virus are still haphazard and sloppy and insufficient and too late.

Japanese Abe Govt repeat that ""Japanese Govt's action is proper"" despite many infected persons,they never admit defects.
They are like Chinese authorities."
2020-02-20 6:34,I would not trust the declining number that China had reported. Anything coming from China is never to be trusted.
2020-02-20 3:25,So is the U.S. testing all passengers coming to the U.S. from Japan? Seems like they should be. They could have been infected anywhere while in Japan based on this news.
2020-02-20 7:34,These enormous cruise ships are an abomination for many document ecological reasons.  I personally hope that their role in spreading this pandemic will eventually lead to their failure as a continued industry.
2020-02-20 13:35,"I am by far no expert on this topic at all; nevertheless, I think that it may not have been the best idea to release hundreds of passengers from a ship infected with Coronavirus. I understand that the passengers that were released had no symptoms of the virus, but they were quarantined on a ship that had hundreds of other people that did show symptoms. They could have easily been infected with the virus. We also do not know how long it has been since they were last tested. The uninfected passengers could have gone multiple days being exposed to the virus after testing negative. This could change the results of their test. I am glad that the uninfected passengers could be released from their quarantine on the ship; however, was it really the right decision to let them go back into the world without being retested?"
2020-02-18 16:01,I know it's not funny but I have to bitterly laugh at the fecklessness of the Chinese dictatorship.  I wouldn't be surprised if this started at the Wuhan pathogen research facility.  I certainly don'[t believe a word that comes from the dictatorship.
2020-02-18 16:34,"I haven't been a fan of using this epidemic as an excuse to throw barbs at Beijing... but Ms. Li's article points out something important. Xi's biggest promise to the Chinese people was to stamp out corruption... but corruption is alive and thriving. Yes, we have plenty of corruption in the US, with our president giving it a new aura of legitimacy, but corruption is endemic on all levels of life in China. People who migrate from China to the US often say that the thing they like most about the US is being free of the petty everyday corruption that pervades life in China. 

Xi has never made promises about 'freedom', but he has talked a great deal about ending endemic corruption. If corruption is now costing lives in this epidemic, let's see if Xi can make good on his promise. 

Thanks for your reporting Ms. Li."
2020-02-18 16:37,"The initial ideological ineffective management by CCP apparatchiks  made the Chinese governmental bureaucracy look too political to efficiently manage this crisis. But to be fair, Americans need only look to the incompetence of our own government's mis-management by political appointees. (George W.Bush's ""great job Brownie"" or Trump's FEMA responses in Texas and Puerto Rico.) Unforeseen natural disasters are always shockers even for reasonably competent administrations. When the ignorant take charge of what they know so little about the problem is usually worsened. How would Trump, this Congress, and our current bureaucracy have reacted if this virus first appeared in Houston or Washington?"
2020-02-18 16:40,"Surely if we in the US had an executive branch which had maintained alliances and had a strong, compassionate concern for the welfare of our entire planet, that President would be right now calling world leaders and organizing a worldwide response to this virus, based upon scientific information and the best practices of the WHO and CDC.

There would be calls for each nation to pledge what it could to fight the virus.  Not just on their own shores but across the world.

Such a President would ask that the UN hold a special session to deal with this.  

Such a President would pledge billions to assist other nations, especially poor nations with little healthcare infrastructure.  

Neglecting to use every tool available to the White House and Congress as well as calling on world leaders, the UN, world organizations to respond to this virus as we have responded to world catastrophes, like earthquakes and tsunamis and famines.

We have the tools.  We need to use them."
2020-02-18 16:54,"I'm not sure what to make of this article really. It brings up a lot of points but frames them with a lot more commentary than facts. Maybe the author doesn't have the resources to do any better than list random, partial facts tinged with opinion or just doesn't have to because the American public is conditioned for ideological critique? I can't say but from what I've seen of US emergency organisation I'm not convinced it's in a position to pass judgement."
2020-02-18 17:09,"extraordinary that the Chinese government, the CCP, seems to handling this as a public relations problem followed by a respond and control drill first, rather than an all hands on deck medical emergency.  That they are set up as an authoritarian dictatorship to protect themselves, rather than the Chinese people, has never been plainer."
2020-02-18 17:14,"The basic logic behind the Govt’s response to self-organised relief measures is that, there shouldn’t be more than one Chef in the kitchen. To a certain extent, it makes sense because without a central command to coordinate, there could be chaos and confusion. The only problem is that the Chef insists on doing everything by itself that it is not utilising all the help that is available. 

The other problem the author identified is that with the centralised command structure, nothing gets done at the local level without approval from higher up. That essentially paralyses the response in the face of a crisis. Xi’s centralization of power has significantly  worsened this problem."
2020-02-18 17:30,"Laurie Garrett, the former Newsday reporter who covered the SARS and Ebola outbreaks, probably knows as much about emerging virus threats as anyone. 

I heard a couple of her videos

Garrett said that the international emergency organizations performed training exercises to see what would happen if they had to deal with a new viral outbreak. 

The main lesson they learned, and the main problem they discovered, was lack of coordination. In an outbreak like this, you need a panel of experts with an overview of the entire operation, seeing problems come up and figuring out how to solve them. It's like D-Day. 

Instead, nobody was in control. In the US federal government, different agencies assumed control of different aspects of the problem -- the NSA handled ""security"" issues, the CDC handled other issues, but in general nobody knew what to do and different organizations worked at cross purposes. Shut down factories and people can't get masks. 

Who decides whether to shut down schools, workplaces, or transportation? In the training exercises, sometimes federal agencies, local agencies, mayors of towns, police chiefs. People just assumed authority. 

So the answer to this article is: Yes, there are problems with central control. But there are problems with decentralized control. The Chinese made a reasonable decision. They had problems, but that doesn't mean it  wrong."

“It is not the critic who counts; not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles, or where the doer of deeds could have done them better. The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly; who errs, who comes short again and again, because there is no effort without error and shortcoming; but who does actually strive to do the deeds; who knows great enthusiasms, the great devotions; who spends himself in a worthy cause; who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement, and who at the worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly, so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who neither know victory nor defeat.”"

Mao could handle the failures of the Great Leap Forward through sheer violence and Xiaoping could crush the student protests 1989 by running them over tanks. But I believe that Xi Jinpeng -as Gorbachev - both of them of a younger cadre than the old school die hards cadres, will find it difficult to put the genie back in the bottle when the system has exposed it weakness to a younger generation of Chineses. So maybe a good side effect of the disaster could be the collapse of the Communist rule"

2020-02-18 21:05,Why have we not heard that the virus is a US backed biological warfare attack? We have the capability. We have the motive. And it is working. And it would be an excuse to cover the Dictators poor performance. Maybe it is??
2020-02-18 21:34,"Based on press reports, the spread of COVID-19 is a major challenge to control in China.  However, the Chinese effort has actually brought the world time to develop plans and hopefully medical treatments to prevent this from becoming a full blown 
pandemic. In the short term, world governments should invest the resources needed by the Chinese to combat the virus there.

Meanwhile, the U.S. government, need to engage in a robust information campaign to ensure that the public is aware of  efforts underway to prevent the spread of the virus here; and how the 
  people can protect themseves. 

At this time, the nation does not need propoganda, misinformation or wishful thinking, but truth about what we are dealing with.  We are all able to see, through various information sources,  how bad the virus is impacting the population of China;and it is naive to have the allusion that is can not get that bad here.

We need to demand that the Trump administration reinstate the funding for the very science, including pandemic response teams, needed  keep us safe from viruses expected to emerge in the future.  Also, there should a major outcry for our government to expend the resources necessary to address the climate crisis before the world is out of time. 

 The source of COVID-19  appears to be a scientific hypothesis at best.  Science can not even make an  educated guess regarding yet unknown viruses waiting to be released as a result of melting ice caps."
2020-02-18 21:37,"No doubt, it’s fair to criticize Chinese leadership, but our own authorities allowed passengers on a cruise ship to get off in Cambodia and board planes for the U.S only to discover that one of their fellow passengers had the virus.  It is unclear at this point whether or not authorities kept any record of where these travelers were headed or what airlines they were flying or if the authorities simply sent them merrily on their way and are now scrambling to track them down.  We will see in the coming weeks how well our government handles this crisis, but given that we’re in the hands of a man who doesn’t trust experts and whose administration already suffers from chaos, it’s easy to imagine things can get out of control quickly in the U.S., too."

The article actually accurately reflects my sentiment / the reality.  Just the title doesn’t make sense.

China has been rising after it became a capitalist country with communist rule and is today the 2nd most strongest economy. China is self sufficient in food production and housing. Are there poor in China today? Yes there are but most have essentials and I never saw more than a few homeless beggars while walking along the great wall and hardly any in the 10 cities, I visited. As Bob Tonnor from Australia has commented, China has lifted millions out of poverty.  and has several millionaires. 

China is not perfect and neither is any other country in the world. The closest to perfection in my humble opinion is Switzerland. It minds its own business, it is an ideal neighbor to 7 surrounding countries and has no enemies. Every citizen serves the country in meaningful way and takes responsibility for keeping their surroundings clean and its air clean. Switzerland is a true democracy where citizens not only elect their representatives but also have a direct referendum on how the budget is divided. Imagine if we the people had an opportunity to have a say in our budget instead of representatives who play dirty politics and Kow tow to lobbyists. You don't have to be a billionaire to run for elected office or to have a fighting chance to be elected.

They have impressed their friends and families with their happy wealthy life. Now this unexpected epidemic causes them a lot of trouble and inconvenience. And once all these masks arrive in their depots, of course they must consider where to direct them: to those doctors and nurses who they may never have to deal with in their future lives, or to the local government, who will show gratitude by protecting and spoiling them in the future.

Although China is the 2nd largest economy, but it is still a developing country simply because 1.4 billion people is tough to deal with.   Just like Ohio State or U. of Michigan, which could be the biggest school in US, but it doesn't mean it is the best school.  It will take time to nurture and educate  Chinese to the level in par with the developed world.

Chinese government is doing an incredible job to lock down cities over 33 million people.  It essentially traps the Coronavirus patients in Hubei province and not let them going out and spreading the problem.

All such activities are viewed as a threat to their control of society. People outside China, especially in the USA and Europe, seem to want to delude themselves about the reality that China is a dictatorship and is therefore an enemy to all democratic nations. China does not allow a free press; does not allow minorities any freedom; are hostile to all religions; lies about anything that may cause a threat to their rule; and will do anything to take advantage over all other nations.

Part of the reasons is due to fear of Coronavirus spreading.  Another reason is due to local bureaucracy who are preoccupied with the virus.  Economy recovery is a secondary objective for them.  Sacking two top officers in Hubei province, the epicenter of Coronavirus, by Xi Jinping due to incapable of handling the crisis is not helping the economy either.  

Just learned from Hong Kong news, Xi Jinping has started demanding local officers to pay attention to economic matters, not just virus alone.

Furthermore, why are we removing people from a quarantine, known to have a large number of active infections of a highly contagious virus, without taking every precaution to ensure that removing people won’t put others at risk of infection?! Doing so completely defeats the purpose of a quarantine, and unnecessarily and recklessly puts others at risk. 

Seriously, DO THEY UNDERSTAND the concept of a QUARANTINE, or INCUBATION PERIOD?! I’m guessing they don’t because they’ve just brought a virus to America which has infected more than 70,000 and killed over 1,700...and I’m not at all confident that they’ll be able to effectively quarantine people here, since they just removed those people from a perfectly effective quarantine for no discernible, justifiable reason.

2020-02-17 14:46,"This is a dangerous time.  In today's paper, we learn that Japan, the world's third largest economy, is rapidly declining, down 6%.  The US economy economy is growing at a paltry 2.3%.  Our manufacturing sector is contracting because of the tariffs.  (Most US growth is in the service sector).  Trump wants to restrict the flow of technology into China which is a chief US export.  China, the world's second largest economy, has been slowing because of the tariffs.  Now this virus has shut them down.

The US cannot carry the global load with only a 2.3% growth.  Everything is in place for a global recession to set in.  If the world does not manage this situation properly, that will happen.

The tariffs are taking their toll.  I'm in the consumer electronics business and parts have risen 30%.  What used to cost 6 cents is now 8 cents, no big deal.  But what used to cost $3.50 is now $5, very big deal.  What used to cost $9 is now $12, what was $2.50 is now $3.25.  

This increases are destroying profit margins and we can't raise prices in a soft economy, and especially, in the face of foreign competition who can get the Chinese parts tariff free.  China supplies the entire world with electronic parts.

Trump doesn't learn nor do his supporters. The process of measuring and predicting can be applied to human populations as well. 

The economies of the world relied on cheap goods from China but the tariffs slowed that down and now the coronavirus halted a lot of purchases and trade altogether.

Why?"
2020-02-17 15:55,"It won't be contained, and it largely isn't as bad as some people suggest. They don't really know how many cases there have been and they don't know what the fatality rate is. If you look at reported deaths and cases one might think the death rate is as high as 2%. However they reported that 1700 healthcare workers have contracted the virus ( a number that is likely to be accurate since they are the ones who administer the test) and there have been 6 deaths among this group. That means a death rate of 0.35% which is far below 2% but somewhat higher than a normal influenza which has a death rate of about 0.1%.

I don't know who these folks think they are fooling. They have no way to stop it. It's too easily spread and they are not going to shut down their economy to prevent deaths in people. The only thing they care about is the economic costs. Just like in the US, the fear is economic, not that people will die."

2020-02-17 16:22,A  good lesson for Chinese authorities to learn from this medical disaster is the importance of upgrading hygienic standards and medical treatment standards in the country.

2020-02-17 16:28,"I spent 5 years working in a Chinese supply chain. Trust me. This is business as usual. We're at most a week behind schedule right now.

As a rule, we operated with an 8 week lead time for anything ordered from China. 6 weeks delivery minimum plus 2 weeks safety stock. Everything was late anyway. However, for Chinese New Years, we bumped the lead time to 16-18 weeks depending on the year and those orders were placed well in advance of the holiday. That's how business in China works.

In other words, we haven't actually seen the economic impact of the virus yet. Everything is speculation.

Will workers return to work with their usual tardy fashion? Travel delays are a perennial excuse for late 1st quarter deliveries. I'm sure we'll hear the excuse in 2020 with the word ""virus"" added to the same rambling explanation. Would you please pay for expedited shipping? That's where this story goes.

The question is when does a highly contagious, pneumonia-like virus start really interrupting manufacturing lines. The obvious answer: When employees start getting sick. Transportation isn't the issue. The problem is highly labor reliant industries. If the workforce gets sick, there's nothing China can do to replace them. More people only equals more illness.

I guess the US will begin feeling serious repercussions around July. The disease will peter off in Summer hopefully but the damage to supply chains will happen months earlier. We haven't seen the worst yet."

This is in spite of the fact that this region has several major Chinese projects which are part of the one belt one road program, with large numbers of Chinese workers, and significant Chinese expat populations.

Either this entire region has miraculously escaped unscathed, or the healthcare system there is unable to detect and isolate cases. This would mean that this infection is currently spreading widely in that region and we will see a surge in deaths from respiratory illness there in the next couple of months or so.

China and other countries with a good healthcare system may be able to contain this virus. It is Africa I am worried about."
2020-02-17 16:47,"Without trying to sound cynical, but imagine if the EU and Trump had been friends now when China is weak. I know, it is a terrible thing to say, but one thing that the Coronavirus has illuminated, apart from the fact that there will always be a new unknown that hits humanity,  is how entangled the world economy is. Not long ago there were cries about China's dominance and now many countries, and companies, are praying for China to open for business again.

To loop back to the top of my comment: A united EU and US would always be more able to adjust the balance of power together when working together and it is situations like this, when there are disturbances in the ""business as usual"", that most changes are being made."
2020-02-17 16:52,"Remember how the U.S. and E.U. credit system locked up during the 2008-2009 financial crises and banks and financial companies were afraid to lend to each other? So now it's not the fear of big companies making a bad financial transaction but the fear of nearly every Chinese citizen of sickness and death. To go from barricaded villages and apartment complexes, police threatening arrest for not wearing a mask, and general distrust of pretty much any outsider to everything is fine let's all go back to work is not going to happen till a shift in perception happens. And with human nature the way it is that can take a long time."
2020-02-17 16:54,"Manufacturing in the US will be disrupted in the short term, as even companies with relatively little China sourced components are experiencing gaps farther up supply chains. Japan, Germany and other export driven economies will be hit harder by a global slowdown. 

Global air travel and tourism will be affected more dramatically this year, especially cruises. 

Falling global demand will impact oil prices negatively, leading to lower oil prices, more fracking  bankruptcies and loss of employment in oilfield related businesses, as significant new supply comes on line in 2020. 

Eventually the epidemic will burn itself out on China, as 98% of those exposed will survive with immunity to this strain. With a million Chinese people now living and working in Africa and few constraints on flights from and to China, it is not hard to imagine a second China sized epidemic there, with fewer fatalities because of a younger population.

Trump's ""deal"" to create $200 billion in exports to China will be largely put on hold this year. 

Sectors of the stock market could experience another earnings recession, as in 2015-16, when oil prices fell. 

If Trump has taken credit for the economy in the past,  in spite of his destructive trade policies, he certainly owns whatever happens this year. His supporters will continue to chant ""just wait till next year"" to troubled agricultural, fossil energy and manufacturing dependent communities."
2020-02-17 17:00,"Happy to note that the Government of China has urged its people to give up non-veg because scientists believe that eating slaughtered animals’ flesh may be the cause of the disease. The virus is believed to have spread from animals to humans.

One research from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention shows that more than 75% of emerging diseases originate in animals. Experts believe that the dangerous virus might have originated in a market in Wuhan, China, where humans have direct contact with live animals and animal flesh. So far, many dangerous viruses have originated in animals such as the new coronavirus, SARS, bird flu etc.

In this context it will be very interesting to note that in India Brahmins may occasionally eat certain types of meat, but generally they eat a whole foods plant-based diet consisting of fruits, vegetables, beans, grains, and other plant foods. Generally they believe eating meat—involving killing an innocent animal—develops bad karma and has harmful consequences.

The vast number of urban small farms on which pigs, ducks, poultry and humans live is close proximity. The situation was improving as modern American agriculture provided pork and other meats, rapidly reducing Chinese dependence on small-farm agriculture. The Trump trade war cut a billion poeple off from thier supply of pork, prices skyrocketed, and Chinese small farmers doubled thier production, again producing the unsanitary crowding of animals and humans that is a hotbed of viral mutation. So yes, the trade war was a major cause of the epidemic."

There is nothing we can do, even with genetic engineering, to stop a virus, once unleashed.   Eventually, Homo Sapien will kill it's own but in the interim pathogens will continue to do what they do best."
2020-02-17 17:43,"It is fascinating to see that Kalitta Air, a charter firm in the Detroit area with military and other contracts, owned by Connie Kalitta, has been hired (a picture on the front page) to bring US citizens back into the country, in a converted high-capacity freight conversion B747 with no medical equipment or controls, and landing at an Air Force base in Texas.  Why would the US DoD (and State) bring almost certainly infected individuals back into the country, on a special contract charter flight, rather than quarantine them outside at dozens of optional non-continental locations?  They aren't using their own military aircraft either (they have literally over 500 hundred capable aircraft available, sitting on the ground, all over the world).  This has all the hallmarks of active virus management, not preventative virus quarantine. This may remind readers of the private charter flights between West Africa and the US with ebola infected patients, carefully protected in order to capture the virus genome.  This may sound too imaginative. Unfortunately it is too real."

This virus has not yet been contained and it could already be spreading in places where adequate public health services do not exist. And please Donald J.

Health is wealth and when that is under a deadly threat, national security is under threat and everything else becomes a low priority. Now that the sleeping giant is awakened by this nano sized virus, the economic giant has to focus on eradication of COVID-19 already a much bigger threat than the earlier SARS corona virus.

China has certainly given a stimulus of over 10 billion dollars to take control of the containment of the virus and before all is said and done that amount could be 30 billion dollars. Hospitals are coming up in China at the rate of 1 every 10 days and certain sectors of Chinese economy will receive a boost. A silver lining of this epidemic is that so far the mortality rate stands at 2% and while seniors are the worst hit and Dr Li Wenliang was martyred, 98% of those infected will survive for better days after optimal medical support. I can also say that within 6 months the highly contagious sturdy virus will be history and we will be talking about this crowned nano monster that once stepped on our planet on the most populated country in the world by the continuing evolution of species that occurs side by side with climate change. Whether our fellow human beings cause the emergence of monster viruses by consuming exotic wild animals or polluting our environment, evolution and climate change will continue its march if we ourselves fail to change."

2020-02-17 17:03,"For quite some time now, “just in time” ordering of parts has been the way for businesses to save money.

But that money-saving strategy is going to lead to huge bottlenecks in manufacturing. 

Picture it:  one type of screw or nut or strange part could hold up the manufacturing of just about anything.

And those who supply those parts are also using “just in time” strategies for metals or plastics etc.

I’m picturing a nightmare where orders are sitting for months infilled.  Not just orders for the finished product, which still would need to be shipped, quite possibly across the ocean.  But for all the zillions of parts needed to make those final products.

Because of hospitalizations and deaths, there will also be empty positions in factories, which add to the bottlenecks that will inevitably occur.

Whatever you might be needing, better to get it now.  Because there’s NO telling how long things will take to get back up and running.

Even car repairs may become a nightmare. Truck repairs.  All of this could slow down transportation, even when something is available.

How can you tell people one week that the virus is so dangerous that you need to stay in your apartment and can only leave once every two days and then the next week say “back to work”?

Chinese medicine and public health are not as sophisticated as in the West.   My gosh, a big component in epidemiology is communication and organization which is repressed over there.   Also, there is a conflict in values between public health and factory production.

A virus is an obligate intracellular parasite.   It needs a host.  And there are millions upon millions of potential hosts in close proximity of each other in China.   People in China are both a vector of transmission and a reservoir of contagion, to use terms of science.

Given the nature of their government and society, Chinese leaders  regard workers as fungible.   This norm will make the epidemic grow much larger.

Instead of a global leadership developing the kinds of intellectual environments and diplomatic tools that could combat such global threats as rising oceans, pandemics, nuclear proliferation, terrorism of all sorts, they pursue policies and plans that disparage expertise of any kind and go out of their way to offend other nations.

Further quarantines and national mobilizations could erupt in other under prepared countries. There will be future events of this nature or worse. People are quick to react to imminent threats like COV-19. Meanwhile the ever increasing worldwide threat of climate change still lingers on the back burner.

The Chinese people will come out of this crisis as both the victims and the heroes. Yet, if something isn’t done to regulate wet markets this will happen again and again. Because the international community demand it and the fact that the US had a legal frame that can address negligence, the Max 737 was grounded world-wide. This grounding and threat of legal recourse has prevented another air crash. China needs to have the right leadership and a legal system that can minimize the health hazards in China."

It will depend on how badly China is lying about how serious the virus is and how effective their efforts at containing it have been.  The fact that President Xi has felt compelled to publicly take control of the response is not a good sign.  It could indicate we are in for a long siege.

This will in turn effect the US economy as we have, perhaps unwisely, tied much of our manufacturing to Chines suppliers.  As those parts dry up it will take an increasing bite out of our economy.  This could be bad news for Trump.  His ace in the hole is a booming US economy, if that evaporates away, then more people will focus on his behavior, he could then be in trouble.

When a patient in the United States shows signs of leprosy, TB, syphilis, COVID-19, etc., your local doctors office and hospital are ill-prepared to handle the testing, and they call on the services of federal (CDC), state, and local departments of public health to combat the contagion and pandemics.

What you now have, ladies and gentlemen, is a nation with modernized urban ppl willing to support democracy but also rural and suburban ppl with devotion to the regime. Since modernized ideology came under crack down of CCP, no wonder its officials are showing such clumsiness in times of emergency.

Fortunately for Russia and the world a series of great Russian generals came to the fore and Stalin recoverd his nerve. This is the problem with communism, everything must be cleared by the people high up in the government and people below are afraid to take individual steps, because any mistake and their head will be on the chopping block and they will be the ones blamed for anything that goes wrong. The Chinese people did themselves no favors, by hoarding supplies, and fleeing Wuhan before the quarantine.
  I feel great sympathy for the Chines people, let us hope as more and more people recover and build up the antibodies that will make them immune, that things will get easier, and the virus as many do will begin to dissipate.

Avoid touching your eye,nose and mouth
wash hands often
Keep your home clean. Wash floors frequently, you and your guests bring nasty things home on your feet.

I wonder how many people in the USA would avoid seeking medical care due to the cost, until their symptoms are severe? I wonder how long it will be before the mainstream media reports upticks in viral pneumonia in US hospitals?

Another way of asking this question is, is the death rate low simply because many people are still sick and could be on their way to death? 

For instance, Dr. Li Wenliang appears to have had coronavirus for 5 weeks or so before he died. (I don’t have the exact dates here, but if someone else does, that would be helpful.)

If it can't manufacture them directly, doesn't China have the resources to buy them from other countries? And if, let's say, they don't have the resources, then how is the rest of the world helping?"
2020-02-14 21:02,"The masks needed are specialized.  I can believe that they are primarily made in China.  It clearly demonstrates the need to diversify the manufacturing of critical medical supplies.  They should be made in many countries and should become a WHO priority.  Even if it means subsidizing low profit manufacturing sites.
NOW...How do we help China?  If you don't have the Christian ethics to ""love thy neighbor as thyself"" consider it a selfish endeavor of limiting the spread of a potentially dangerous virus in a very inter-connected world.
For those laughing at China's misfortune, consider how well our medical system will fair with 20+million without health insurance and the most expensive medical on earth.  Even if our system can cope; how many will be bankrupted with high deductible medical costs?

Using a rice cooker to “dry steam” surgical masks for three minutes can have a sterilizing effect, an experiment by Chung Shan Medical University Department of Occupational Safety and Health associate professor Lai Chane-yu (賴全裕) and his team showed.

However, after dry steaming, the mask would have a lower filter efficiency compared with new masks, Lai said on Monday, adding that the method should only be considered if there is an insufficient supply of masks or they need to be reused in an emergency.

The team conducted several tests for cleaning N95 respirators, and found that a 70 percent alcohol solution, bleach, high-pressure sterilization and rice cooker were all effective sterilization methods, Lai said."

2020-02-14 21:03,"Hard to believe China is incapable of drop-shipping medical supplies from one province to another. Western Allies were able to support Berlin for 323 days with nothing but air transport and no helicopters. You're telling me China is struggling to get medical supplies from factory to hospital within their own nation due to provincial interference? I'm a bit incredulous.

Anyway, the article still doesn't answer my original question: How many medical workers are infected compared to the overall medical staff? That's our metric.

Comparing medical workers to confirmed infections is useful if you want to make comparisons to SARS. Is CONVID-19 much more dangerous to medical workers than SARS? That's useful information. However, that's not the question we're asking right now.

We're asking: How close is China's medical infrastructure to complete failure? When do medical workers start bolting for the doors? They will eventually. You can't pay someone to mop-up diseased bed pans without offering a reasonable chance of survival. They are going to quit. That or they will burnout and/or die.

Either way, you have a problem. You can't replace doctors overnight. Well, the entire ship ceases to function anyway if the Captain is the only person left on board.

I want to know employment statistics specific to medical employees in Hubei and Wuhan. How many workers are out sick? What's the turn rate? How's morale doing? And so on. You can't contain the virus if people won't go to work."

2020-02-14 21:00,"Most people you see are wearing the wrong type of mask to strongly protect against airborne viruses. One needs the so-called FFP3 Respirator Valved Mask at a minimum to ward off most viruses to 99%. These typical surgical masks one always sees are not good enough. One of the “bonuses” of the FFP3 mask is it’s harder to breathe through them. During the day you’ll get by but at night, example, on a ship—where you wear it all the time, even when sleeping, its difficult. Add to that, one has to change the mask often and not touch the outer fabric which could be contaminated. That, my newspaper friends, is a hardship!

I had some similar experience with the U.S. Army Pro  Gas Mask of the 1990s. Trying to sleep during a Saudi Arabian dust storm was pretty near impossible because the human resting breathing rate is not acclimated to the extra breathing effort required.

So, if masks are sent, they need to be good ones."

I am an American RN and I also have an RN license in an Asian country where I teach nursing. This is very typical of hospital construction in that region. Just because the place where the put the patients in China is called a hospital does not mean that they follow the same standards as American hospitals do."

But what if the virus was just allowed to run its course throughout the world, with continual detailed information to everyone about preventive self-protection and about self care at home if someone becomes ill. 

The world is NOT going to be able to isolate and quarantine everyone, as has been done with cruise ships, for example. There seems to be a reliance on ""putting people away"" somewhere rather than describing to everyone the best way to handle this.

Hospitals would not be able to manage everyone coming in with symptoms.

I understand there will/would be deaths but would money and time be better spent educating people with stories and ads on how to prevent and self treat this illness?

The problem now is that China is the country that makes medical supplies. Diversification of manufacturing is the lesson. Maybe supplies could be air dropped in? The patients need help but the helpers are becoming patients. The Chinese people are paying the price for having an authoritarian government that is skewed by corruption."
2020-02-14 21:11,"China is remarkably efficient in production, but its distribution systems are crippled by draconian communist policy.  

Imagine being so close to water, but unable to drink because there is a red barrier in front of it.  

The communist party do not seem to understand that the barrier that is making them fail at this and their economic endeavours is their control over the voices of its people.  

Free communication will open up networks that allow for local and national actors to release the bottle necks stopping medical professionals from receiving masks.

It will be messy, opening up communications networks, which is probably the most intolerable aspect of the process.  But, it does not mean the country would lose cohesion.  It does not mean the government would no longer be centralised either; as clearly parts of the centralised system work well for China.

The communist party no doubt want China to be successful and prosperous, but they are at a bottleneck in its development, and the next step is freedom of speech.  That's the reality that they will have to face.

But, until then, many of their citizens and medical professionals will die needlessly."

It also does not allow you to touch your face with your hands. The only downside is that it requires batteries but lithium ion batteries last a long time and could be carried with the user.

If the crew on the ship wore these while distributing the food then no one would have caught the virus. They are expensive and used in welding and other manufacturing processes but should be readily available.

3M should be sending these to the infected areas for people to use."

Then I went into the lobby and queued up in a line of 10 people waiting to check in while five different intake receptionists registered patients. Eventually I registered and was called back into the exam room, where I waited a half an hour before my physician came in. 
Mind you, this was a 10am morning appointment, and she was already running behind by a half hour. During my appointment, she disclosed to me that she's been working until 8pm each evening just to keep up with patient follow up and medical notes.
All of this is just a very roundabout way for me to illustrate that if we snicker at and look down upon the Chinese for their equipment shortages during this crisis, do not - for an instant - assume that we can do it so much better here in the United States. 
If this virus gets a toehold here and begins to spread widely, rest assured that we will confront the same dire (and embarrassing?) problems here. Especially under this dysfunctional administration. China is a cautionary tale and we'd all do well to show some empathy and learn."

2020-02-14 23:32,"It's human nature to ignore risks that seem distant, but in a risk analysis you assess not just the likeliness of an event but also the impact.   In my opinion the likelihood of a pandemic that either starts or reaches the U.S. fall somewhere around 4 on a scale with 5 being  Never.   The numeric value for impact would depend wholly on our ability to respond.  I used to think that we would probably never fall below the medium in such an event but now I'm not so sure.  

The CDC needs to be well funded and we need a wholesale review of our process and resources. We have to have ready masks, testing kits, methods of communication, quarantine  spaces, and most importantly, adequate personnel.

While unlikely, we have to be prepared.  The result of what would happen if we are not is unthinkable."
2020-02-14 23:42,"If the newly-christened COVID-19 virus becomes more virulent, spreads rapidly in the United States and makes hundreds of thousands of people critically ill, few cities would have sufficient in-patient facilities to care for them.

He was in fact telling all GP Doctors not to send people with mild symptoms to them hospital.

Donald Milton, MD, a professor of environmental health at the University of Maryland, helped prove via the use of his Gesundheit machine that influenza could be spread via aerosol transmission. He said he is in contact with colleagues in Singapore who are attempting to study the transmission of the COVID-19 viruses, which are often called nCoV, for novel coronavirus.

Though Chinese officials said earlier this week that they believe the coronavirus is transmitted only via droplets, implying they do not believe airborne or contact transmission plays a role...

""To me this sounds like someone trying to deal with panic, because people panic when they hear airborne transmission and long-distance transmission,"" he said. He said there has been scientific evidence of aerosol transmission of MERS-CoV (Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus), so it is likely possible for this novel coronavirus, as well.

""You cannot tell the difference epidemiologically between something aerosol transmitted by weak sources and large droplet spray,"" said Milton. ""They behave so similar, it's very hard to pick up the difference.""

When times are good, things perk along ok, those in power raking in their ill-earned gains, while the general populace is so preoccupied with the apparently genuine possibility of making a decent living, it's unable to take note of what the government is really all about.
Come a crunch (pandemic, stock market tank, etc.), we suddenly realize that current governments are totally unequipped to deal with crises on such a scale. They've failed to allow them as possibilities, hence have no strategic plans in place. (It's a debatable question whether the CDC would have done a better job containing a rather infectious virus than PRC has done to date.)  
The PRC government has always been driven by the imperative to look good. It demands ""hearts and minds"" in order to ensure its own life, as against (what it claims would be) undesirable ""social upheaval"". (Perhaps some members of the GOP are now close to claiming that as the alternative to their own re-election?)
When the CPC fumbles, as now, it just kind of looks, roughly, like Boeing, which, thank goodness, is not a polity, but simply a huge business concern.

Today's doctors in this crisis are working the same way: countless hours under extreme duress. Sooner or later a respirator will slip, a nurse might take hers off, finder coated with infectious detritus, and a health care worker will die. 
They need all the support they can get."
2020-02-15 5:07,"There was a piece in the NYT recenty that said people might be worrying too much because of human nature: wrong. 

The death rate is probably about 16%. The only recent figures that I could find said that about 7100 people had recovered and about 1300 people had died. There is no point comparing the number who have died to the number who have been infected because you don't know how the infected cases will pan out. 

COVID19 is more infectious than cold or flu. It has a long incubation period (Ebola is only three days) at 14 days (some people say up to 28 days), and it can be infectious before there are symptoms. All that is bad. 

The NYT said that the death rate in China is only so high because their health system has been overwhelmed. Overwhelmed - that word should be a clue. That does not happen with flu. If 60% of the US gets COVID19, and 20% of them die, then that is about 36 000 000 dead Americans. At least if that happens we won't have to listen to people being smart and saying not to worry because flu kills 40 000 each year."
2020-02-15 2:48,I’m hoping that public health planners and others in this country are keeping a close eye on things in China and have a plan for what we would do if an outbreak occurs. It’s lazy to suggest that America would never reach the level of chaos in China today due to our more open society/better handling of such things. Nobody knows how dangerous this virus really is. If China can’t even keep up (where everything is made these days) how will we be sure everyone has enough masks and suits?
