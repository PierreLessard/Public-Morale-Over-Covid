2020-09-29 15:13,"We’ve always known that being overweight poses significant health risks. Logically, it would lower one’s immune system. This isn’t rocket science. In another time in America, it was called, common sense!"
2020-09-29 15:19,"We have failed so much it’s harrowing. Our country should have immediately taken a hard lined pro health initiative. We should have had mass unity for going outside getting vitamin d group home zoom workouts and created a full campaign to combat obesity in a positive and constructive way. We could attack the farm Bill and encouraged a way to get fresh produce in poor neighborhoods. We could have had White House cooking classes. There’s so many unifying things we could have done with care and compassion in mine but we don’t and just won’t. We protect feelings over mortality. It’s not about beauty it’s about life, human life. If we tackle obesity we could have affordable healthcare but we refuse. Well it’s going to cost us the economy and the loss of people we love."
2020-09-29 15:26,"Right now I am eating like crazy due to stress.  I understand maintaining a reasonable weight is difficult for people who live under economic  stress.   But, we do ultimately control what goes in our mouths.   We don’t all live near places where you can buy fresh produce.   But, with some exceptions, the vast majority of Americans do not live in food deserts.  And, I would like to remind people that frozen vegetables have the same, or even more, nutritional value.  Quick freezing maintains the vitamins that can be lost in transit on the way to the grocery store.   Also, labeling reading is a helpful practice which avoids excess fat and sugar, even when shopping at Walmart, which I do routinely.  It’s rare that I buy in to the old Republican saw of “personal responsibility” but people of all economic strata can and should take more control of what they put in their mouths."
2020-09-29 15:29,"I was so scared of COVID, I lost 20 lbs with 15 to go.  I could not have lost this weight if I were not working from home and doing so many things remotely.  It takes time to create a healthier eating plan and exercise - all that time used to go into driving myself and others around.  I really wish our entire culture could be transformed and all didn't have to make sacrifices to hang on to our health insurance."
2020-09-29 15:33,"I'm obese. I'm not proud of it and even if I try to lose weight, it will take a long time before it will make a difference. So I do other things that have shown to help. I wear a mask. I rarely go out, don't socialize especially in crowds and never indoors. 

Only my grandchildren come into my house and then, only rarely. I wash my hands frequently. I took the Senior flu shot last week. 

I'm still debating the COVID-10 vaccine. From this article, it sounds that it won't help me too much. I wish others would step up to the plate and follow recommendations of Dr. Fauci and others like him. If everyone did all these things, the virus would be under control quickly."
2020-09-29 15:33,"lots of folks gained weight during the shutdown with popular places to exercise like the gym, trails, parks, beaches closed.  
Food deliveries from grocery stores often did not have meat and produce choices available, so deliveries included  carbs and packaged goods only.
A lot of the ""covid"" pre shutdown buying was shelf stable items purchased in  large quantities like flour and baking items.
All of these caused increase in obesity.
Gyms in California are still closed.
A survey of pre covid and current weight would be useful"
2020-09-29 15:43,"I am slim and believe obesity leads to all kinds of health problems, and am in no way advocating putting on more weight in a country with an obesity epidemic, but I have also noticed that my sister-in-law has been overweight (hard to say whether she tips into obese, very close) for as long as I’ve known her; she has boundless energy even though she barely gets enough sleep, and never gets sick despite being exposed to every germ as a schoolteacher and being often cold in the winter.

She wasn’t even eating well (hence the weight problems), though she has finally decided to change her habits, more to lose weight rather than improve her health.

Whereas I am increasingly getting sick in the winter, and severely, even with the flu shot.

So I wonder whether there are other factors contributing to her very strong immune response and overall excellent health..."
2020-09-29 15:45,"This has been known for months.  That public figures (Doctor Fauci, anyone?) haven't been urging diet and exercise as much if not more than masks and social distancing has me completely flummoxed.  Can it be because our culture has become SO sensitive to this, that or the other ""victim"" that we can't even speak the truth anymore?

Sadly, I see this in arenas far beyond the Covid one."
2020-09-29 15:45,Aren't there still healthy vegetable options that come in a can?
2020-09-29 15:47,"When COVID=19 forced me to work from home, I started making cookies and cake. Seeing the pounds add on, I finally stopped. In the last two weeks I've lost 9 1/4 inches and 10 lbs with 40 lbs. to go. Whatever vegetables I can't eat I freeze them. Also, I pre- chop cucumbers, carrots, red onions, etc. to add to my salads later. The pandemic is frightening enough, but as a senior, I need to do everything I can to stay healthy."
2020-09-29 15:57,"More Americans need to be educated on food and nutrition, it's a shame that these things are not taught in schools. At 23 I am learning more about macro and miconutrients, how they effect the body, how sugar, refined carbs, unrefined carbs, etc. effect the body. All from Google. I've changed my eating and exercise habits, don't drink soda regularly (have you seen the amount of sugar in ONE can?), always try to eat a vegetable and fruit with every meal, etc. I have been healthy throughout this pandemic and have seen positive body composition changes. I also go to the gym regularly, and have been going since my state lifted the ban. Earlier this year NYT ran an article about people returning to a gym, and the amount of hate in the comments was really saddening especially when we have had an obesity epidemic for years in this country and it's only projected to get worse. Taking care of your body, mentally and physically, has so many wonderful returns. Is it hard? yes. Does it require some extra planning and thinking and effort? yes. But it has been so worth it to me. 

Oh, and I have to drive at least 45 minutes to get to a Walmart. I buy fresh, frozen, and canned fruits and vegetables. Don't know if my area is considered a ""food desert"" but it's definitely not like I can walk down the street to get food. What Americans really need is EDUCATION about what we should put in our bodies and why. The countries leadership has failed us in this for decades."
2020-09-29 15:57,"""When asked if they were testing the effects of weight on vaccine effectiveness, ... [vaccine makers] said there were no public plans to investigate the issue.""
More than 1 out of 5 US adults are obese (with many more overweight). And drug-makers ""don't plan to investigate"" whether the vaccine will work for them? I'm sorry - WHAT?"
2020-09-29 15:57,"Overeating is a condition that can be avoided by carefully cultivating habits to eat only to satisfy hunger that reflects need for nutrition. There are many communities of people who because of various purposes do have fewer members who are over weight. They agree to follow certain principles which promote carefully considered dietaries or constraints. But it’s not easy and it does not prevent all from eating problems. 

Humans developed under conditions of uncertainty about nutrition and to work vigorously for many hours without having to eat. The result is an organism that stores and uses energy as needed rather that as it uses it, so fat storage is essential. But if more is stored than is used over an extended time there can be problems. Fat accumulated beyond the capacity of fat cells results in fat left in between cells and over time reactions build up which can poorly affect health. 

We understand that obesity may affect anyone but it seems to occur more often among people suffering distress who gain temporary relief from eating or those with certain metabolic disorders. It also becomes a habit and habits can be very hard to change. This is where communities can help each other by encouraging and supporting habits which avoid overeating."
2020-09-29 15:58,"Perhaps if the government would stop advocating a food pyramid that is literally upside down, people might understand which foods to avoid for better weight management. Education is desperately needed for this country to make headway against the obesity epidemic. It is, of course, easier and more profitable for drug companies to just keep treating the symptoms, never addressing the cause of the obesity and/or diabetes."
2020-09-29 16:00,"Fat cells produce many immune signals that cause the immune system to be in a constant inflammatory mode. Its this that causes lots of inflammatory disease, autoimmune, heart, diabetes, arthritis etc, All related to an over active immune system. 

This compromises the immune system to be able to respond strongly to a sudden challenge. Also, obese folks have different bowel bacteria that are part of the problem. They encourage immune over activity,"
2020-09-29 16:10,"As if I needed another good reason to lose weight - there are so many.

Hopefully this will be the things that motivates those who most easily have the tools and resources they need to slim down healthfully to do so."
2020-09-29 16:14,"I suspect that the lower death rates in other countries are because of lower obesity rates. If we had a sane governance (federal, state and local), they'd be singing the mantra: loose weight, in addition to mask wearing, physical distancing and (largely irrelevant for this disease) hand washing. But no - perhaps out of a desire to avoid ""fat shaming"" - we can't have nice things."
2020-09-29 16:21,"Obesity and obsession with obesity seems to be a uniquely American disorder. In the European countries I have visited meals are eaten at mealtime and food is enjoyed. Also food shopping is done more frequently and preparing fresh vegetables and whatever main course (fish, chicken, pork or beef) is not considered such a pain in the neck. Only in America have I witnessed someone behind the wheel chomping on a sandwich while driving. We are victims of ourselves. Personally I don't find healthy eating to be so difficult."
2020-09-29 16:46,"I feel as if this article could have benefited from clearer editing to highlight its key points:
1) Obesity increases several risks associated with COVID-19, potentially leading to adverse outcomes.
2) Some aspects of these adverse outcomes are heightened by medical providers' apparent unwillingness to give obese patients the care they need, based on the stigma associated with obesity.  
3) At the same time, a person's weight is not the sole indicator of health, and doctors should take their entire medical picture into account in diagnosing and treating them."
2020-09-29 16:51,"A good review of obesity in light of the current pandemic. It’s well known that obesity exacerbates most acute disease states & increases the risk of several co-morbidities. I am more concerned about Ms.McCloud & her family being able to find healthy foods. 

A quick look at their area of the U.S. shows there are some programs available to address food insecurity, e.g. “The St. Louis Area Area on Aging (SLAAA) provides home delivered meals & congregate meals to seniors 60 yrs & older and to persons with disabilities 18- 59 years.” 

Having worked for similar programs, I can attest to the fact that the meals must meet certain nutrition guidelines, often coming with health education as well. I’m sure during the pandemic these programs have been limited, but I would hope upon discharge from the hospital Ms. McCloud was provided at minimum with a list of community resources, such as the SLAA.

It’s also worth mentioning that Medicare part B (potentially) covers behavioral therapy sessions that include a dietary assessment and counseling to help one lose weight by focusing on diet and exercise. 

It is concerning that some vaccine makers aren’t taking into account obesity and the efficacy of the vaccines. That being said, I do wonder if they are taking into account the efficacy of the vaccine on elderly patients, as the article points out that the immune systems of elderly patients also struggle to “marshal effective defenses against pathogens?”"
2020-09-29 16:52,"a lot of comments here talk about how the government is afraid  to mention weight loss due to fears of fat shaming. i don't think that's true. the problem here is corruption.

large multinational producers of beef, soy, corn, wheat, and potatoes receive subsidies from the federal government. the FDA has pushed for high carb/sugar consumption and allowed unregulated ads on unhealthy foods to penetrate the media because it helps prop up the products that they are subsidizing. 

fatness is way more profitable than health. pharma, care providers, food growers/manufacturers, fast food, fitness programs, and the banks who finance it all - benefit immensely from an unhealthy society. 

with billions of dollars in advertising, lobbying, price undercutting, and other means, individuals have no shot against this behemoth operation. 

sure, there are unhealthy foods in other countries, but their governments do more to ensure that people have access to healthy food and are fully aware of the consequences of excess fat starting at an early age. they also have guaranteed vacation, work hour limits, and family leave that give people time to be active. 

if you're saying that a single mom who has to work 3 jobs, take care of a parent, buy food to feed 2 kids on minimum wage - with no paid vacation or time to exercise - made the CHOICE to be obese, then you need to get your facts straight. the government and corporate america are absolutely to blame for this crisis."
2020-09-29 15:35,"People become fat because they can. This is embedded in DNA.

Only by using self-discipline, which is very unpopular now, can one avoid weight gain.

Blaming others or industry does not work.

Obesity is the greatest preventable cause of premature disease and death in the US."
2020-09-29 15:41,"How does obesity affect the immune system?  Well, it doesn’t, but obesity is mostly caused by the same things that alter immune responses.

Even though your lipid panel measures the triglyceride in your blood, there are no bare triglycerides there; the triglyceride is mostly contained in VLDLs, evil lipoproteins from mistreated liver cells, which meet up with CETP (cholesterol ester transfer protein) and are converted to even more evil small, dense LDL particles which are so tiny that they pierce the arterial lining (endothelium) - where the immune system attacks them, forming life-threatening arterial plaque.

Your liver generates VLDLs in response to carbs, fructose (sugar) and alcohol; which, not coincidently, are also prime causes of obesity.

While these small, dense LDLs are now widely accepted as the prime cause of arterial plaque, they are blood borne and also cause similar immune responses in asthma and other auto-immune diseases.

So then, your immune system which is intended to quietly lie in wait for malign invaders is instead chronically aroused.  Since the initial immune response is already chronically triggered, especially in the obese, it’s no surprise when it fails to attack Covid"
2020-09-29 16:05,"I've long been waiting for someone to tackle this ""elephant"" in the room.

It seems those countries with the highest rates of problems are those with the biggest investments in Industrial Foods (eh hem).

Vietnam -> 1/3 of the US of A's population and yet only:
- 11 deaths per 1 million population - 188th overall in the World
   vs
USA in tenth place with:
- 634 deaths per 1 million population

- UK 619 deaths per 1 million population
- Spain 672 deaths per 1 million population
- Italy 594 deaths per 1 million population

On the plus side, these *large* populations are well placed to survive the Great Hunger TM when it arrives :-)"
2020-09-29 16:21,"It's incredible how many people in the comments, loudly proclaiming themselves ""healthy"" (read: thin), shut off their reading comprehension and empathy in the second half of this article. I would ask those people to analyze where their knee-jerk reaction to discussions of weight come from, and why their selective reading kicked in so that they have nothing to say about the discouraging treatment of overweight people by their own doctors. 

I would guess that the majority of the people leaving these unfeeling comments are ignorant of the science as to why almost all diets fail even when the dieter has willpower of steel and all the time in the world to exercise and drive 90 minutes round-trip to a grocery store. They are likely also ignorant of the fact that having all the time in the world to exercise and drive 90 minutes round-trip to a grocery store is a level of privilege most Americans don't have, especially during this time of widespread economic devastation. 

There are real societal reasons that many Americans are overweight. It's not laziness; it's capitalism. Low-paying jobs demand long hours and don't keep up with rising costs of living and student loans; that combination leaves workers mentally and physically exhausted at the end of the day. Combine that with taking care of children or aging parents, and combine that with the stresses of disability, racism, and poverty in this country, and see if you feel like meal-prepping and spending two hours at the gym."
2020-09-29 15:51,"I am obese and had the virus and was not even hospitalized, I'm not praising obesity, but really? we already struggle with our weight, with discrimination because of our weight, among othwr complex we develop thanks to fat shaming culture, and now we have to be stigmatized too thanks to covid? I have a decent immune system (despise of my obesity) not everyone is the same, and I do really hope we get to get a vaccine once available without diealing with side looks or rolling eyes because of my weight"
2020-09-29 16:28,"I am always astounded by how fat Americans are and soon found it is not the will or intent, the whole society is geared for food capitalism, fatty, oily, salty, sweet food. A single veggie Subway for me  is stowed away for another meal, never seen bread called “6 inches” so chubby, my loaves each week are that long. A complete engineering of food, access, infrastructure has to be done... I eat maybe 8 types of beans and legumes but it is easier to get half a kilo - a day!- of meat which I don’t eat."

2020-09-29 15:03,This is the first article I have seen about obesity's link to Covid 19 complications. Why aren't Fauci and the Surgeon General encourage people to adapt healthier diets? People's lives are on the line because of excess weight. It's way past time we got obesity under control in this country.
2020-09-29 15:17,"It is all relative from what I have learned in life and reading stats and studies.

What I mean by that is that extra weight gradually causes problems over time and the amount of weight.

Somebody a few pounds over weight actually lives longer than a person who is a few pounds underweight.

A moderately overweight person will live as long as an average weight person but will have all sorts of quality of life issues like bone, ligament and muscle problems and other issues.

An obese person will have a shortened life span and be miserable."
2020-09-29 15:45,"Cue the body shaming. 

Never mind that there is proof that insulin resistance comes first, causes weight gain, then diabetes, then more weight gain from medications like artificial insulin. Weight gain that compromises the immune system and stresses body systems, exacerbating inflammation and causing pain, making you sicker and sicker. You get blamed for making yourself ill because you got fat... shame, shame. 

Illness is rarely the the fault of the victim. That narrative is is old, it needs to go. Better diagnostic testing and newer science will hopefully soon crack open the real mystery of why so many of us are having issues with hormones and metabolism. Then we can help those who struggle with illness and obesity.

Until then, can we just concentrate on being kind to each other? No matter the size or how we look?"

2020-09-29 15:04,The two wonderful close friends who died of Covid were slender and kept fit. This one sounds like a loser.
2020-09-29 15:09,"This is a new twist.  Keep the economy shut down, and people out of work and on welfare, and dependent on the left, because 40% of the country is obese, and obese people won't respond well to the vaccine, and they are obese only because of systemic racism, and the country deserves to be punished for that.  Neat."
2020-09-29 15:15,"American people are fat due to Addiction to Big Corporations. 
We need to completely rehaul
Our factory farming , ie get rid of them
Especially, livestock, Pigs, cows, chickens. Pay more for meat, support small Family farms that are sustainable.
I already do and have , by carefully shopping.
I started on organic 20 years ago. And my 3 children are thin strong healthy.
One survivor of Covid 22. Only lost sense of smell. 
It is true."
2020-09-29 15:17,"And now we’ve got the whole “healthy obese” promotional campaign to try to make being fat not only okay, but healthy!"
2020-09-29 15:35,Really good article. Thank you.
2020-09-29 16:02,"“The way they were saying it is that because you’re obese and didn’t take care of yourself, you’ll get this disease,” Ms. Franklin said. “I feel like that was unfair.”

Unfortunately, viruses really have no interest in being ""fair."""

2020-09-29 14:56,Another good reason for pretty much all of us to lose weight
2020-09-29 16:50,"It's especially brave of these folks to share their stories, given the extent of prejudice against people who are overweight or obese. I wish them well in their continued recoveries!"
2020-09-29 16:58,"Obesity is a cultural not economic thing. Some of the poorest countries in the world like India, Pakistan, sub Saharan Africa have much lower obesity than developed world."
2020-09-29 17:20,"Working from home has meant 2 hours a day NOT spent commuting, and more breaks from sitting in front of a screen- so more cooking from scratch, planning meals so one grocery load can last 2 weeks, fewer impulse junk food buys, no eating in the car or at a desk, and time to take a 30 minute walk every day instead of sitting in traffic.  Self- discipline turned out to be a lot easier when circumstances changed.  I’m not as thin as my rich friends yet, but I’m a lot healthier than when I was doing that commute to work; sit all day; squeeze in food shopping; pick up kids; cook dinner; exercise at 5 a.m. or not at all; and drink alcohol to “decompress” from it all.  You might say all of that is “self-imposed” and that’s true if you think that being willing to do what it takes in our wonderful world to put food on the table, educate the kids, afford health insurance, and support yourself in old age is a “voluntary” choice.  I hope work routines and health care financing changes as a result of this pandemic so that it’s easier for everyone to keep themselves healthy, and less expensive for us as a community to take care of each other when we fall ill."
2020-09-29 17:16,"This is just  more FAT SHAMING.

not like there has been about 300 different such studies about being too much over weight."
2020-09-29 17:19,So how do the doctors explain a person like me who is overweight but either never got the virus or was an asymptomatic carrier if I did have it?
2020-09-29 15:14,"One of the problems with obesity as a health issue is that we really don't have a good treatment for the condition.  The approach we have used -- shaming and berating obese people until they starve themselves -- is ineffective and unhealthy.  I don't know why some people accumulate fat while other people burn off their excess calories and moderate their intake, but taking a moralistic approach to a health condition isn't getting us anywhere."
2020-09-29 17:15,"As other commenters have noted, the current culture of “body acceptance” and “anti-fat shaming,” while undoubtedly begun with the best intentions, has ultimately done more harm than good.  Being overweight, let alone obese, is a serious health issue.  From personal experience—after gaining a large amount of weight after thyroid surgery, and struggling over time to lose it—being seriously overweight is not something to celebrate.  Being winded walking up a flight of stairs, having difficulty moving around comfortably, trying to squeeze into airline seats, etc.—none of that is enjoyable, no matter how much plus-size messaging tries to spin it that way.  More importantly, obesity is directly linked to a myriad of serious health problems, which have been known about and explicitly stated for years.  And now, with Covid, the warnings are even more important.  We don’t promote a culture of “diabetes acceptance” or “cancer acceptance,” yet  obesity is every bit as serious as these two conditions."
2020-09-29 16:40,"Everyone seems to have an opinion on weight and nutrition. Some valid and others in the Trump zone. Really, the issues is about more than just food and eating. We are unwilling to fund usable public transportation or build walkable neighborhoods. If you want food you need to drive to a grocery store or order it on line. Having experienced no car grocery shopping I can attest to the difficulty of trying to fit this activity into a work schedule that involved a less than efficient commute. Other issue...poor folks who can’t afford the more nutritious five dollar loaf of bread or the higher cost of boneless skinless chicken.

Obesity in the US is more than a matter of fat shaming."
2020-09-29 15:43,"Obesity is a huge factor in co-morbidity. I am obese and had been working hard to lose 13 kg weight - then quickly gained 7 kg on the severe illness of my niece and sudden death of my mother (neither from Covid - but the pandemic didn’t help either). I have no choice to get back on track though - I work in China (via zoom for now) and prefer working in academia internationally. I need the vaccine to work with me - I need to have travel health insurance - I need to get back to a new normal that includes lots of travel and community activities. We can blame many external factors (all legitimate), our bodies and or uncontrolled emotions - but I have to stick to my plans and get things under control or my obesity will limit me in ways that will destroy my quality of life."
2020-09-29 17:32,"It's interesting that the obesity boom coincides exactly with the beginning of the mass movement of hundreds of thousands of factories out of the country to places like China, Mexico, Taiwan and Japan in the late eighties and which continues right up to this very day of my comment.  People are living in fear.  When people live in fear the brain starts to tell the body to prepare for a possible starvation event.  The average American has been living in great economic fear for well over thirty years now.  The average person has been told that it is their fault these well paying and steady jobs left the country.  

But it's not their fault.  They are the victims of corporate leaders who have betrayed the unwritten contract between our fellow citizens, their neighborhoods, and the factories.  Now, there is no upward economic path for the average person without these factories.  Americans in general are overeating because of economic insecurity.  Almost every American is reminded that they are unworthy and easily replaced.  Just about everybody in this country is scared, really scared about making money.  And it will remain that way until the factories come back.  If they ever do.  Until then, everything really is hopeless.

 As a side note, bringing back the factories would reduce global greenhouse gas emissions immensely.  Shipping trillions of pounds of goods from Asia 9,000 miles across the oceans produces immense carbon emissions, but I digress."
2020-09-29 17:33,"Fast food. Processed food. Junk food. These are the products of corporate America and a major driver of obesity. Corporations helped create this enormous health problem, and they should take responsibility for it."
2020-09-29 17:35,"This past Sunday my girlfriend and I (we're middle-aged) were hanging out on a bench enjoying beautiful Lake Michigan. Three twenty-something women walked by; all three were overweight by 50 or 60 lbs.. They each had a small frame and narrow shoulders; this was clearly weight they had added over time to their otherwise slight builds.

I commented to my girlfriend that if this were 1972, they'd all be thin. Just as in the preponderance of photos you see from the '70s.

I'm not offering any theories here—all are well known—nor desiring to insult or judge anyone. It's just an observation, a cultural one."
2020-09-29 17:45,"Perhaps it is really due to poor circulation, which is common in obesity. Poor circulation would affect immune cells getting where they need to go for the body to respond quickly. If so, then exercise and deep breathing may help."
2020-09-29 17:48,"Primary care physician here.

I care for many morbidly obese patients (BMI greater than 40), and the pattern is the same.  They like eating fattening foods, and they don't care to stop.  

I do not fat shame.  I treat obesity like any medical condition.  I've tried being positive, supportive, and encouraging, and it is generally all to no avail.  

Ultimately, this is an issue of personal responsibility.  People control what they eat and how much.  It is easy to count and budget calories.  There are good free apps out there available to all, some that even include links to healthy recipes.  There's really no excuse."
2020-09-29 17:51,"I am a participant in the Pfizer vaccine trial. I have received the first (of two) injections (which have a 50% chance of being a placebo). I was weighed at the session.  Because the trial is being conducted by my health provider (Kaiser), Kaiser (and thus Pfizer?) has full access to my health records, but I don't know how much analysis of that kind of full data will be done.

I was considered a desirable participant on three grounds: age (70) and diagnoses of diabetes and hypertension. I have ""reversed"" the diabetes, meaning that my blood glucose levels have been normal for over two years without any diabetes medications (I follow a low carb diet). 

I was overweight/obese most of my life, but lost 65 pounds two years ago. I've maintained that loss, and I'm hoping that there aren't many residual risks for COVID associated with the past obesity.

Of course, I am well aware of the medical bias against obese people. Ironically, the medical profession hasn't offered much in the way of help in losing weight. Its ""eat less, move more"" and ""calories in, calories out"" mantras are abysmal failures and reinforce patient shaming. I was able to lose the weight only by consulting recent nutrition research that discards those failed models."

However, it's such a touchy subject. She feels like I'm judging her, but I'm really scared for her. Why don't doctors say, ""You must lose weight, and here's how."" I really don't understand why she's fat and I'm on the slender side. I never see her eat that much more than me. It's so unfair. I wish I could change this for her, and feel so helpless. She lost a lot of weight on WW, but didn't stick with to goal, and then gained it all back and more. So, I know it's hard. Why isn't there aa anti-fat vaccine?

Every time Congress begins to scrutinize the profession, the AMA launches a major public relations campaign, such as a ""war on smoking,"" etc. The fact is, there are fat people, and they have a right to be fat. It is natural to many, and not a result of a lack of self-discipline or some other fault. In my case, it is due to injury and damaging medications prescribed by irresponsible doctors."

Most Americans -- even heart disease patients -- are not aware that high blood pressure and diabetes are the primary causes of kidney disease.

Consider that lack of awareness in the context of Covid, and it's a recipe for disaster for those who contract the disease, especially of they are obese, have high BP and diabetes.

Even this far into the pandemic, there's a dearth of knowledge of the damage that the coronavirus can wreak on the body...most people still think it's ""only"" a respiratory disease.  

But it damages the kidneys, also. Acute kidney injury is a big risk...which can have long-term kidney damage. Some Covid patients even require dialysis.  If a patient ends up in the intensive care unit (ICU) their odds worsen—reports indicate that 20% and higher of intensive-care patients have lost kidney function.

The Covid pandemic should be a  national wake-up call for education and awareness on the importance of preventative measures."
2020-09-29 22:47,"There was a documentary in the 60s, I think, called Hunger in America, and showed the lives of impoverished communities in Texas and the Deep South. The people interviewed were thin, some very malnourished, and had nearly empty cupboards. It was unthinkable and a national shame that this,
essentially starvation, was happening in America. 

There was a follow up I think in the early 2000s.
People in the same communities were just as poor, but many were overweight and obese, with health issues. Their cupboards were now filled with unhealthy and highly processed but accessible (if you live in a food desert) and cheap food. 

Thank you, agribusiness and politicians who are too eager to reward their donors. That we can’t nourish Americans is still a national shame."
2020-09-29 21:12,"I’ve been fat and I’ve been thin. Here’s how I’ve stayed thin and, more importantly, healthy for several years: Time-restricted eating. It’s more commonly known as intermittent fasting but people freak when they hear the word “fasting”. It’s not difficult and I’m rarely hungry. Start with the 16/8. Even mainstream, traditional doctors are acknowledging its benefits. 

Every time you take a bite of food you release insulin into your bloodstream. This frequent release, without a prolonged break, leads to insulin resistance, obesity and type 2 diabetes. For more details on this, search on Dr. Jason Fung. He’s a nephrologist who specializes in obesity and type 2 diabetes.

The proof is in the pudding. At 57 I can now say I’m metabolically healthy (ideal levels of blood sugar, triglycerides, HDL cholesterol, blood pressure, and waist circumference, without using medications)."

I was once obese.  Now, I'm merely overweight so I know it can be done and my new, slimmer physique can be maintained.  I have too much excess skin that can't be lost from diet or exercise to ever be skinny, but despite this excess, I'm in the best shape of my life and I've maintained it. The key is a lasting lifestyle change.  It isn't a diet that I can ever go off of; it is a nutritious eating pattern coupled with exercise, both cardio and weight training.  
We don't do people any favors when we repeat that it can't be done or that they are doomed to fail if they even try to lose excess fat.  Crash diets fail because they aren't designed for success.  They are pointless, short-term deprivations.  Making a lasting change in your body composition means making a lasting change in the inputs to the body and the demands on it in the form of exercise.  Walk a lot.  Lift weights. Count Macronutrients.  Get sufficient rest.  Quit alcohol, cigarettes and sugar.   Access to fresh produces is overrated and not necessary.

Barring disabilities, anybody can get a fine workout in their living room by using a Theraband set. There are gobs of Youtube aerobic exercise videos - if nothing else, just do Jumping Jacks. 

Nearly 2/3 of folks never use their gym memberships, so it's hardly an excuse that the gym might be Covid-closed. The average American watches 4.5 hours of TV/day, so the ""no time"" excuse doesn't pass the smell test, either.

Same thing with eating well. If no other options are available, sodium-free canned veggies are plenty healthy and, for most of us, can be ordered online for home delivery.

Our national health crisis is no surprise. Americans, on average, consume 500 more calories/day than we did in 1970. On paper, 500 calories/day = 3500/wk = 1 lb of fat/week = 52 lbs of fat/year.

Especially worrisome is vaccines' failure to provide expected immunity.  Every unimmunized person is a hazard because no vaccine is 100% effective, even if everyone else gets it.  The fewer people that are immune will mean more chance of runaway disease and less chance of ""herd immunity"", a legitimate concept when applied to vaccination (not to be confused with the ""herd mentality"" of mass infection intended by idiots).

No one should be made to feel shamed about body weight or any other condition.  That does not mean that, like, say, addiction, it is not a condition and one that affects others.  The article mentions medical equipment that is incompatible with larger people; what about the caregivers?  How many extra hands and backs are needed to move or reposition the obese and infirm, each instance risking additional exposure and need for more PPE?

I cannot see how genetics can explain why Americans of all ages are among the fattest people in the world.  Our ancestors came from places that have far less obesity than we do.  What happened to our genes in the last 50 years?  (I still remember the name of the one overweight child in my elementary school class.)  What has changed is the amount

I have heard people argue that drug companies won't come out with an untested vaccine because they fear lawsuits but therein lies the clincher, the drug companies can't be sued if the vaccine turns out not to work or is harmful, so they have every incentive to try and come out early, because they are indemnified. 

The irony is the one thing that will hold back early use of a vaccine will be Trump himself, he has so blatently politicized this, announcing that a vaccine will be available on november 3rd, that even his own dumb cult member don't believe it, or think he would rush a vaccine out for political reasons."

There are a *lot* more young people than older groups for a similar length age bracket. If you take that fact into account, young people have an infection rate quite commensurate with our population size (20% of cases sounds like a lot, but we twentysomethings are in fact about 20% of the population!) and to the exact same degree that the 60+ age group has an infection rate commensurate with *their* population (also about 20% of people and Covid cases). But “infections are occurring evenly in a manner that suggests no demographic is doing better or worse than pure probability would predict” doesn’t make for good generational mud-slinging headlines..."

Check out the Kansas COVID counts and see how every corner of the state is being touched. Remember that the western half of the state is far less populated that the eastern half. Ellis County is one of the most populated counties in the entire western half of the state, and they have less than 30,000 people in the county. 

I’m sorry that COVID has come to the middle of the country. Those on the coasts did their best to contain it for everyone else, with great personal sacrifice. But too many people followed the “lead” of the President and decided it’s a hoax. They act like COVID is not a big deal and as if the sacrifice made by so many other Americans was stupid and pointless, like they were sheep following a dubious leader in Dr. Fauci. 

I don’t know if those in Kansas will be able to tie their impending grief to the leadership from the White House. Probably not. They are a hardy folk. They will bury their dead and move on."

     Trump’s experience with regulation is that he is forced against his will to rent to black people and called to account when he hides casino losses with gambling chips purchases by his dad.

We should also have known that there is no way to shut the world down and eliminate the spread of a disease that for the great majority of people has a trivial impact. If the elderly had been strongly advised to genuinely keep to themselves and had been given support to do so, deaths could be a fraction of the current total. Instead we have been promoting the absurd notion that we will stop the spread and we all should take the same half-measures to do so. The media regularly warns us that COVID is a deadly killer and people suffer long-lasting effects, but rare anecdotes are no replacement for real facts. Remove the elderly from the data and COVID just doesn't look very serious in the context of risks we accept each day. But what about the obese! Yes, what about the obese. They have been willingly traveling a path to chronic illness and an early death for years. Why isn't there relentless and dramatic media coverage of childhood obesity, a disease drastically more serious than COVID? Our response to this situation has been irrational and ineffective. Now we have millions in financial distress, governments deep in the red, and countless serious disruptions to life as we know it. None of this was necessary."

I'm aware that imminently qualified scientists still work diligently at the public health agencies. These career scientists certainly were alerted to the virus and issued warnings to higher-ups the moment it's presence was made public in China. However, having placed illegitimate appointees with their nefarious agendas in public health agencies, such as CDC & NIH, has made them completely untrustworthy. Until these appointees are removed, along with the purging of unqualified new hires, I will be getting my health information from accredited medical & scientific groups which still value scientific methods.

Based on that, you would then posit that the young would get covid-19 first, followed by the middle aged and last the elderly, without having the ""blame"" any generation for ""seeding"" an outbreak. It is equally plausible the elderly were passing it among themselves, just at a slower rate leading to a later increase in cases, not that cases passed from 20 somethings to the elderly."

Neighbouring Canada's Statistics Canada reported today that excess mortality (the best measure of deaths) since the SARS-Cov-2 epidemic began in January is 7,000; that compares with an estimated 200,000 to 250,000 (no one knows) excess deaths in the US. OK. The US has 10 times the population, so if America did as well as Canada has done containing the epidemic, the comparator is 70,000 deaths -- in other words, the US has 3 times the death rate from COVID-19 than Canada. If that doesn't condemn both the US government response to the epidemic AND American healthcare, nothing will. That's especially so because Canada is no leader in controlling COVID-19 and two provinces, the most populous, Ontario and especially Quebec, have worked hard to have as shambolic, confused and disastrous a response as south of the line. Americans just don't pay attention to anywhere outside the States. They are oblivious to the facts that they have the worst COVID epidemic, live in the most violent society, lock up far more of their citizens, have the most lawless police and governments, the most useless and expensive healthcare, the shortest life expectancies, by far the greatest inequality, and the worst human rights record of any developed country. Unfortunately, November won't change any of that. Republicans/Democrats, what's the difference besides the rhetoric? Venal parties and a venal Congress just roll on."

2020-09-24 17:20,"President Trump Wednesday said, "" The White House may not approve the new FDA guideline for the coronavirus vaccine "".

Vaccine is not a panacea. Eight hundreds to 1000 people are dying a day in US from the virus not because lacking of a vaccine. It is because as a country, we are not practicing equally important tools of public health measures such as mask, distancing and contact tracing. On top of that, we are sustaining the community spread with political rallies, premature business opening, holiday gatherings, inadequate planning for school opening, Sturgis events in SC etc.

Let say we are lucky with a vaccine 60% effective , 50% of the population ( recent polls )are willing to receive the vaccine. That means only 30% of the population have benefitted from the vaccine. We still have to wear mask, distancing if one can for the next 12-18 months until herd immunity is raised to a level to contain community spread. There is still no hard evidence that the coronaviurs vaccine can sterilize the airway so as to prevent community spread. What it does is to minimize or prevent covid-19 infection. 

Don't get me wrong, an effective and safe vaccine will allow us approaching close to normalcy in life. That is why Dr. Redfield said in the Senate hearing, "" Mask is more effective than the vaccine "". I believe the public health official should also inform the public the first generation vaccine may not be the one that they expected."
2020-09-24 17:26,"I’m tired of seeing the “Millennials” term thrown in so quickly in NYT articles like a Molotov cocktail of blame.  The article quickly then states the highest rates of infections are in the 20-29 age range. I’ve seen articles describing how Millennials are getting sent home to live their parents when colleges move online. 

“Millennial” is not a vague term for “young person”! Millennial is supposed to refer to people born between 1980 to 1995, generally. Most millennials I know are nearly 40 years old. Our issues with COVID isn’t a college campus closing or our local watering hole closing down, but rather balancing the difficulties of managing and reopening our businesses, updating our clinical practices for best COVID protocols, all while caring for our children and helping them learn from home (and yes, many of our children are 10 years old).

Has “Millennial” just come to mean “entitled young person without responsibilities?” Because I don’t know a single Millennial that fits that description."

What a hypocrite.  Trump is the one injecting partisan politics into the process.  The lying hypocrite accuses others of his sins to hide his own sins.  Just like lying to the public then accusing the newspapers of fake news when they report the truth, or calling the pandemic a hoax. The only hoax is his trying to show there is no pandemic.  What a snake.

"" A survey found that 51 percent of Americans would either probably or definitely take a vaccine, down from 72 percent in May""

Not only is he a hypocrite, but a stupid one.  He wants people to get the vaccine when available, yet his statements and interference make people more likely to delay or pass on getting vaccinated. Just like he wants to get the economy moving and can't understand that his actions have caused the virus to spread faster, delaying the full re-opening of the economy.  

Trump has been his own worse enemy, but it is the American people that suffer from his hypocrisy and stupidy.  And the stupidy of the people that continue to support him despite all the evidence of his injurious policies across many departments.

Worse, and more intractable, are the ways he undermined the rule of law and non-partisan Justice Department, lying to the public to deceive them, and his contempt of Congress while extending the power of the imperial presidency.

At any rate I applaud New York in standing up to Trump over the approval process of the vaccine."
2020-09-24 18:04,"As a retired professor of psychology and public health, I agree with Governor Andrew Cuomo that we cannot ""trust the federal government's opinion"" on the safety and efficacy of any coronavirus vaccine given the corruption and politicization of both the C.D.C. and the F.D.A. by the Trump administration. Hopefully, the drug manufacturers will make their data available for reanalysis to confirm the results and to insure that the randomization process was properly implemented. Even if all this done, there is still the very serious issue of the generalizability of those who participated in the trials to vulnerable population like the elderly and people of color. I would urge Cuomo's experts to see if the data can be stratified by those populations who are most in need of the vaccine."
2020-09-24 18:19,"This is one of the worst actions he could take at this point.  Confidence in institutions needs to be reinforced, not undermined.  Concern over a vaccine is a non-issue, for the following reasons:  1) the trial results will be available publicly and internationally - if it works and it's safe, we'll know it; 2) all the vaccine companies want their vaccine available globally - they're not going to fake the data or want there to be any doubt about their product.

Look at all the comments saying they won't trust the FDA.  Not a single one has a valid chain of logic.  For Cuomo to contribute to institutional distrust in this way plays right into Trump's hands, right into the Russian's hands, and contributes to the social media-fueled aberration of everyone thinking they have their own facts."
2020-09-24 17:49,Seriously. would you trust a man who deliberately slowed down the whole postal system for political reasons to approve a fast tracked vaccine also for political reason? I wouldn't trust anything Trump and the Republicans say or do. Their words mean nothing anymore. Vaccine? hah.

It’s unconscionable that Trump and his GOP enablers are willing to take a gamble on the health of the American People by releasing a rushed vaccine. It is alarming that the agencies entrusted to protect the public health don’t have the gumption to stand up for what is right.

At the risk of sounding like a broken record: this is all the fault of your Constitution! The idea that a Russian agent could assent to the Oval Office simply wasn't contemplated by Washington, Hamilton, Madison and so on. I can't blame them, I have to blame you, 2020 Americans!

But it has happened. Deal with it. Get him out, one way or another, before he can do more harm. And charge him with treason, at a minimum.

The fact that anyone takes what Donald Trump has to say (other than at the level of a malevolent threat) with any seriousness (he claims to have a ""great, stable genius brain"" because he had an uncle who worked as a professor at MIT!) is a measure of the severe level of ignorance prevalent in this country. This is coming from a man who paid a brighter lad to help him cheat his admission to college by taking his SAT exam. I never cheated on a test in my entire life.

My interest in 1930's Germany has been revitalized. How did a country with such accomplished people decline so quickly under the sword of backwardness and blind conformity?

Why did a significant portion of the population attend auctions of the belongings of their Jewish neighbors who had been boarded for trains heading to the death camps merely days before? Why does the photographic record of those auctions show people smiling and in a jovial mood?

The issue of safety had already been compromised by not insisting on a yearlong trial.  It certainly is justifiable to forgo data on long-term deleterious effects - given the severity of the disease.  However, to nix the FDA proposal that we need to wait for safety data at 2 month for at least half the participants is outrageous.  

What purpose would this rush serve?  The number of doses available before the election and infrastructure to distribute them would be minimal.  Announcement of a vaccine would immediately get people to lose up on their behavior and increase infections.  Yet it would be 3-6 months before most would be able to get a vaccination.  Lay people would refuse the vaccine because of the political interference.  Professionals would look at the pathetically underpowered safety data and refuse because they had no real idea how dangerous it might be."

2020-09-24 19:54,"""New York State will conduct its own review of any vaccines for the coronavirus that are approved by the federal government, out of concern that the process has become too politicized, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo.""

Mr. Trump's latest insults New York is naked jealousy because, frankly, the success of New York with the pandemic proves how differently the entire country could look during this pandemic with competent leadership!  Governor Coumo's distrust of this administration is warranted and Andrew Cuomo is protecting his constituents. 

You should take the lack of interest by other countries in Trump's vaccine as a warning.  This is a global pandemic that every country in the world is suffering from.

The truth is that the rest of the nation, my own country included,would welcome involvement from others with Andrew Cuomo's character, patriotism and intelligence."
2020-09-24 20:43,"""Cuomo is forming a panel to review federally authorized vaccines, citing concerns the process has become politicized.""

Cuomo is spot on. My own state should do the same, or join Cuomo's effort. Trump now tells us he is going to make the rules for approving a vaccine? Nobody in their right mind would trust such a process."

Cuomo is applauded for telling people that there was no problem with social interactions weeks after Trump sounded what many Democrats say was too weak an alarm and shut down travel. Biden says no one would have died if Trump hadn’t shut down travel. Biden never answers why, during the Obama Administration, in 2009, nearly all of the emergency stockpiles were used up and not replenished. Trump is blamed for not replacing all the materials as soon as he took office. Trump now wants people to be safely vaccinated as soon as possible. However, Cuomo wants people to panic and not get a protective vaccination and as a result get really ill and maybe die. Who will you believe? Are you feeling lucky?"
2020-09-24 21:10,"Cuomo has quite a nerve as New York is second only to NJ in its death rate. Anyone who thinks Cuomo did a good job is denying the facts you don’t have 3 to 4 percent of your citizens in NYC die, tell your  the Mayor of NYC not to panic the citizens of the city by telling the facts, begging on national TV for assistance at a hugely elevated level, and not even fully utilizing the assistance that was provided."

2020-09-24 22:57,Couldn’t an unbiased third party vet the vaccine rather than adding another layer of bureaucracy? Seems inefficient for every state (or every state governed by a Democrat) to confirm the safety and efficacy of the vaccine.

2020-09-24 22:50,"Never put it past Cuomo to believe that he is the ultimate authority on how to handle the Coronavirus. Unfortunately, his decision to sacrifice thousands upon thousands of senior citizen lives to the virus by sending them back to highly infectious nursing homes disqualifies him as a credible critic of the president. Remember, Cuomo begged Trump for ventilators, PPE, and federal help to combat the virus, despite having sold off New York's ventilator supply years ago to fill another budget gap. Trump gave new York every ventilator Cuomo demanded, and all the PPE they asked for, and more. And he sent the hospital ship Comfort to New York harbor, and outfitted the Javits' Center as a first class medical/hospital facility. Cuomo could have sent the nursing home Coronavirus positive seniors to either facility; instead he chose to send them back to their nursing homes. Then they died by the thousands. That's on Cuomo. Case closed. Cuomo will never be president, he is a liar and self-promoter of the highest order."

In what right mind would anyone think that a Pharmaceutical company would release a vaccine without the proper trials and FDA would approve. Talk about conspiracy theorists. So I guess what would happen is the rest of the United States would be getting vaccines and New York’s most vulnerable will continue to die because the emperor wants to be the one to have the say so. Unbelievable."
2020-09-24 23:17,Let’s get this straight: New York exported Covid to the rest of us.  And now it is going to second-guess us on vaccines?  Best of luck!

Everything trump does is in some way self serving to his financial interests, his inflated image, or envy/hatred/jealousy of men and women that made REAL accomplishments. 

I can not think of ONE thing he has done in the past 4-years which has been a real benefit to all of the people in the country...not one.  

His Failure to confront the deadly Covid-19 virus and the loss of over 200,00 lives, Dangerous and Divisive rhetoric, Tax Cuts for the Rich, Inhumane Immigration policy, no Healthcare plan to replace Obamacare, fanning the flames of Racism, the Destruction of the Environment, his undermining of the FDA and the CDC, and his continued attacks on the validity of the upcoming election.

The only question worth asking is why are elected republicans supporting making Russia and China great at America’s expense?"

Especially important to get a consensus of the scientific community--using  large committees of experts---rather than finding some loner who says what the president wants to hear but clashes with scientists in general.  Trump is unfortunately too certain of his own genius to be willing to let others make the necessary decisions, and we the people suffer from the increase in sickness and increase in deaths and increase in climate damage.

These types of programs do not lend themselves well to ""virtual classes"" as they often require hands-on, show-and-tell types of learning.  Given the pandemic, this kind of ""congregate"" education attendance is bound to suffer."

We have six weeks before November 3rd; why would they place their careers on the line by displeasing him? Their reputations as serious men of medicine and/or science flew out the window long ago.

We saw Dr. Redfield, last week, run over like a train when the president, after the fact, put his own words into Dr. Redfield's mouth about mask-wearing. The president's rabid base hates them and he acidly reminded his CDC director of that particular partisan political fact. Dr. Redfield's a cutout.

The president insists that his October surprise, a vaccine, will be on pharmaceutical shelves next month. Dr. Hahn, as FDA Commissioner, has no choice but to go along with the fantasy. Whether such a godsend would be safe and effective is not a serious question. Getting out the votes is. Dr. Hahn is taking a deep breath and he can't possibly exhale now.

2020-09-23 13:14,NYC is our gold standard for managing the Covid-19. The states that refuse the common sense and easy to follow guidelines have soaring cases publicly and in schools. With 4% of the world population we have 20% of the cases. City centers in many cities are closed but NYC is reopening. Restaurants innovate with sidewalk seating - the rest of the country refuses to adapt. The current set of vaccines are based on an untried technology. Suppression of testing and reporting of numbers has led to lies from the President about the reality of our tragic situation. The callousness of the Republicans is mind boggling as they plan to remove healthcare even as they refuse aid in battling the pandemic. Vote early and vote Democratic.
2020-09-23 13:16,So Trump was right. Far out the guy is a genius. Who would have thought. I just think of him as the guy from the Apprentice not the saviour of America. Truly a marvel to behold!
2020-09-23 13:15,Johnson and Johnson foisted opioids on folks and is paying out hundreds of millions in fines. They called opioids “harmless.” This marvelous company produced powder with asbestos for decades that was sprinkled on babies. I am not allowing their vaccine near my body. Their company name went from trusted to toxic in a few short years.
2020-09-23 12:41,"Biden better get out of the way, here comes the October surprise.  And the glee by which the news that millions of lives will be spared by the vaccine is sparkling clear this morning in the NYT comments to wit:

It's all about saving lives, right?"

I would never take any vaccine produced by this murderous corporation."
2020-09-23 13:53,"There's a lot of talk about cases but I couldn't find one mention of an uptick in the sick or dying. Am I missing something? Also, are these upticks in cases due to horribly inaccurate rapid tests or PCR? Also, if no one is getting sick despite positive tests, isn't that a good thing? Or, do we expect body bags imminently? I've been hearing ""wait 2 more weeks"" for going on 4 months now. How long do these 2 weeks actually last? I'm suspecting that virtue signaling and taking down Trump may be complicating all the ""science"". But then again, a discredited German ""scientist group"" predicted almost 266,000 cases and scores dead from the Sturgis Motorcycle Rally. So at least that didn't happen. But what about Herman Cain? Sorry he died. Seemed like a nice guy. But many people also die from flu too. At the end of the day, this thing is very catchy. Zillions will get it and some may even get sick. The question is how sick and how many will die? In March it was a lot, esp in nursing homes. But we've all been exposed to this thing already so it's not novel anymore. So the question is: do we keep these lockdowns going for a run of the mill virus? (Of course, if ppl start getting seriously ill and dying again we can adjust.) Something tells me all will be known on November 4."
2020-09-23 14:02,"A president who is paranoid and consider loyalty to himself as the only qualification for a high level job is going to preside over a never ending string of failures.  

A true leader put competence above all else.  That competence includes:
1. Subject competence (professional knowledge and experience in the area that they are going to make decisions about)
2. Leadership competence (the ability to inspire and get the people you are in charge of, to believe in the mission and plans)
3. Coordination competence (ability to collaborate with other people who you are not in charge of but dependent on for your mission to succeed)
4. Communication competence (the ability to explain the mission and plans to succeed in a way that convince both insiders and outsider)

Trumps biggest failure as a leader is that his personal insecurity and paranoia has left him incapable of identifying competence for what it actually is, and instead seem to think of it as disloyalty."

The Mayor has chosen the Sheriff to do the job as well as monitoring bars and restaurants. Given the manpower of the Sheriff’s department it’s an impossible task."
2020-09-23 14:00,"Trump insistence  on placing himself at the heart of the Covid 19  vaccine business is counter  productive .
 To begin with No sane person believes that  the Clown President who does not believe in Science has anything to do with the pharma companies coming up with a vaccine .
Secondly his promoting a vaccine and pushing for the FDA  to rapidly approve it will only have one result. 
People will  choose not  to get the vaccine as  we are by now painfully aware that anything Trump advocates is likely to do more harm than good .
So what will inevitably be  sold as Trumps vaccine/cure  will be seen as nothing but him selling more of his snake oil .
Personally I will take my chances and continue  to wear a mask  and social distance, and vote Blue November 3rd like my life depends on it .

That is, if you care about people’s health and all. Otherwise go on about it. Tweet it to the heavens, or wherever sits just below. 

That’s the whole point, right? You?"

2020-09-23 14:55,"The news from Johnson and Johnson is good news indeed.  But there is a potential problem: American tort lawyers.

There have been many multi-billion dollar verdicts against several major US pharmaceutical companies including Johnson and Johnson, over allegations that their (non-vaccine) products cause cancer or have unexpected side effects. In the opinions of many, these verdicts are not warranted; they seem based on junk science and sympathetic plaintiffs. The standard for ""guilt"" in civil tort suits is the preponderance of the evidences, or 50.1% of the evidence, as assessed by a jury of lay people.

During the 1970's and early 1980's, lawyers nearly shut down vaccine production in the US. Only  a last minute no-fault liability law, the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act of 1986, allowed vaccines to remain available in the US.

The same thing may happen again.  It does not take many $2 billion dollar verdicts to bankrupt a company, and literally tens of thousands of suits are pending.  

Congress needs to pass tort reform, and provide some degree of protection to companies, at least for the duration of the pandemic. To be blunt: 500 to 1000 people are dying each day from Covid in the US. Only safe and effective vaccine can end the pandemic.  Whatever you may think of ""big pharma,"" right now we need a vaccine far more than we need more lawsuits, and it's the pharmaceutical industry that has the resources to develop, test, and mass produce a vaccine."
2020-09-23 15:03,"Look out for what happens with those stricter guidelines for emergency approval that FDA scientists have developed.  This is an attempt to save the credibility of the agency with regards to release of the vaccine, by adding an independent review by experts.  Against that desperate attempt to save hundreds of thousand American lives, stands Trumps political agenda.  An independent expert review would never approve a vaccine before the election.  Now that the brave scientists at FDA have leaked the draft rules, the White House can either refuse to approve and release them (shooting Trump in the left foot), or block the approval (shooting him in the right foot)."
2020-09-23 15:19,I see one potential problem with J&Is vaccine. Generally live vaccines are not given to people who are immune suppressed by their treatments or underlying diseases. This is a high risk group most in need of a vaccine. This group will have to wait for another vaccine.

2020-09-23 16:12,"While watching today's Senate hearings on COVID, I wonder at the verbal gymnastics executed by the witnesses to keep from criticizing Trump or some appointed officials.  Its like they are walking on the edge of a glass, slip one way and lie for the President and they lose their self-respect, credibility, and maybe their careers.  If they slip the other way, responding with candor and honesty, they also risk losing their careers and the opportunity to continue working to protect the country from Trump's evil policies.

'Tis a dilemma.  Part of me hopes they can maintain their balance and continue helping the country while another part says we are way past accommodating Trump's evil actions, its time to call a fool a fool.  And that is NOT hyperbole, he is literally a fool - a deranged person lacking in common powers of understanding. But this fool is extremely dangerous and has killed over 100,000 Americans with reckless disregard and gross negligence.

The witnesses must have had to spend a lot of time preparing for the hearings to ensure they are prepared to pivot or misdirect to obfuscate answering a direct question.  What a waste of their valuable time during this pandemic!"

Rand Paul is a danger to the country. as is Trump and every other Republican in Congress and the Supreme Court."
2020-09-23 16:23,"The J&J may well  require a booster each year and that booster would likely have to be a different Corona vaccine. Because the J&J  vaccine is based on the adenovirus to which the body rapidly develops an immune response, a booster based on the adenovirus would likely be useless."
2020-09-23 15:59,"In the last couple decades, 19 of the 20 largest drug companies have been successfully prosecuted for major civil and criminal violations.  Not exactly a trustworthy record.  

For example, Johnson & Johnson has made billions on Risperdal, a second-generation antipsychotic. In the early 2000s J&J concealed its serious side effects (stroke, excessive weight gain, diabetes, pituitary tumors, breast growth in men, death), and it paid off state mental health officials to buy this new drug that cost about 45 times more than previous medications.  The drug did massive harm to many helpless patient victims.  Eventually Johnson & Johnson bought its way out of liability with multi-million dollar settlements in Texas, Pennsylvania, elsewhere.  

A small dent in the multi-billion dollar profits.  Just the cost of doing business."
2020-09-23 19:26,"This phase  3 J&J clinical trial is supposed to use a dose chosen among those studied in a previous phase 2 trial. It is to me surprising how could that choice be made when the phase 2 dose-ranging study was initiated just one week ago (I am actually a participant in the phase 2 trial). Either the phase 3 trial is using an at risk strategy (which I would expect to be described in its informed consent document for participants), or the phase 2 study is useless. J&J, the FDA and the EMA should clarify this intriguing question."
2020-09-23 19:32,"It says we won’t have to pay for the vaccine. We already paid for it since it is our tax dollars that are paying for its development. Given that, we should be charged again when receiving the vaccine."

Isn’t our current Ambassador to The Court of St James the very same Woody Johnson whose billions come from J and J?  Isn’t this the same man who lied when asked about using his office to try and get the British Open played at Trump course and who had served as Trump’s finance chair? 
If he was willing to lie for Trump about minor matters like golf, why wouldn’t he lie about vaccines to get his lord and master re-elected as well as boosting the stock price?"
2020-09-23 18:18,"Why do the health officials continually announce dates and numbers for when a vaccine will be ready? So we’re supposed to believe that no matter when a successful phase 3 trial is completed, 70mill doses will be ready by next July? What if none of them are successful? Can we still expect to see 70 million doses of the non-existent vaccine by July?

The national discourse around the virus is mind-numbingly dumb."
2020-09-23 18:13,"Data ‘might’ be available by end of the year. That probably would mean the vaccine would be generally available somewhere around summer 2021.

But hey, who are the folks actually developing the vaccine to talk. Fearless Leader says ‘just a few weeks from now.’ And he surely would know. I mean this is the guy with the crystal ball. Light inside the body. Disinfectant. Plasma. Bleach. Hydroxychloroquine. Gone by April. It will disappear, like a miracle.

And that wall. The one Mexico paid for. The beautiful health care plan that covers everybody and costs less. The millions of jobs in coal mines and factories.  This guy has all the answers; he never lies; and he keeps all of his promises.

Oh, one more thing: I’m Napoleon Bonaparte."
2020-09-23 19:18,"Given the fact that the CEO of Johnson & Johnson has a history of attacking his own employees who criticize Trump, I wonder how it is that they are at the forefront of finalizing a Covid vaccine? I also wonder if they are planning to price gouge us all when it is released, unlike Salk who wanted to help mankind. I don’t have confidence in anybody this close to Trump. I find that troubling that I am given to conspiracy mentality on this topic. Shows how badly our country has been run since 2017"
2020-09-23 19:58,"Dr. Redfield should resign. He let the political force change the CDC’s report of the Smithfield meatpacking plant inspection in SD, in April 2020 to “recommendations” instead of mandates to protect the workers and the people they then came in contact with.

Sorry, but I don't trust any official word coming out of the FDA or the CDC under this administration. And I definitely don't trust Johnson & Johnson on their word alone. 

I will wait for something akin to international peer review right now, thanks."
2020-09-23 18:10,"Good article. J&J started development back in January and is not rushing as much through the trials as the smaller companies, which inspires confidence. If I'm not mistaken they're already producing it in large quantities, ahead of trial results?

And I thought the Oxford/Astrazeneca candidate was still in the lead for first, despite a small hiccup? That one also just needs a fridge."
2020-09-23 19:54,The reputations of both the FDA and CDC are damaged beyond immediate repair.  The W.H.O. is a much more reliable source of information than either the Trump controlled FDA or CDC.
2020-09-23 20:00,"Make sure you read this NYT op-ed by 2 doctors. 

To simplify: In order to be approved, the FDA requires a vaccine reduce covid-19 by 50%. The problem is that most cases are mild cases, in young people, who may not be hospitalized (or even know it unless they're tested). There are fewer severe cases, in elderly people, who frequently die. 

Suppose the vaccine reduces the mild cases, to meet their 50% threshold, but doesn't reduce the severe cases or deaths. It could still be approved, even though it wouldn't save any lives. (In the protocol, ""death"" is not a primary endpoint.)

A discredited, not to say beaten, man Hahn's word is worthless, as is his agency.  To make political sport of 200,000 needless deaths he put the nation and all its people at greater risk.

Once I hear these scientists and include Canadian Scientists then I know we are good, the one plus I give PM Trudeau and my Premier is they both refer COVID questions and treatments to our physicians.
Here in Canada, we are seeing an increase in COVID infections, we are able to trace it to the re-opening of businesses, schools, but most disturbing the gathering of too many without social distancing and masks. The main offenders seem to be the younger generation who tend to follow the Trump philosophies so there is more than just the US at stake when it comes to the selfishness and recklessness of this failed leader.
 In most of Canada, heavy fines are being placed on organizers of these gatherings, Police are also following thru with visitors and those that have been mandated to isolate. 
The Premier of Ontario did not follow thru on some stage reopenings and has decreased the limit of people allowed to gather, regardless of the event, some areas that are considered high risk will be facing further restrictions.

Inaccurate and misleading articles by Trump appointees have been falsely posted as scientific reports on the CDC site. Under severe pressure, they changed the testing guidelines but the changes which were universally condemned by virtually all of the outside experts subsequently had to be walked back. They have recently hired for the pandemic team a fervidly pro-Trump doctor. Problem is, his colleagues universally say isn't qualified and is wrong on every thing he has said about the pandemic science. Hahn, Fauci, Redfield, Giroir, and Birx have shamelessly tiptoed around His Highness when what they should have been doing was giving the nation clear and unambiguous advice. America simply doesn't trust this administration and for good reason. Political appointees are permitted to override the scientists when it comes to approving or rejecting vaccines.

So clearly, the vaccine temperature must be moderated before injection. To what temperature is the vaccine brought before injection and how do we avoid degradation in warming the vaccine up?

That is codified in administrative law.  For Trump to try to eliminate that committee, he would need to present an emergency finding for justification.  Otherwise, he cannot take such unilateral action to change the process, because changes must be presented in the Federal Register and given a period of public commentary.  All of this is in the Administrative Procedures Act.  He has tried to circumvent the APA requirements in the past, and he has universally failed, even to the point where the Supreme Court has turned down his arguments.  

How can he argue for an emergency need for a vaccine, when he has denigrated the core basic guidelines:  distancing, masks.  He does not have medical or scientific justification to ""cherry pick"" the treatment protocols.  

One can only wish that some member of his cabinet or office of legal counsel would tell him the truth.  Not that he would listen.

Fortunately, even with his potential decree, the group of vaccine manufacturers has already gone on record that they will not release a vaccine that is not properly vetted.  They cannot allow for serious adverse events to cast a pall on the mass vaccination program that this country needs.

And yet the president is obsessed with the notion that the release of a vaccine before election day will benefit his chance of being reelected.
Trump is also fixated on “sweeping the forest floor” to avoid the conflagrations caused by “exploding fallen trees.” Like they do in Europe.    ????
I myself am astounded by the alarming frequency of newspaper headlines which contain the word “science” and the name “Trump.” Somehow these two terms seem to dangerously and invariably contradict one another.

Trump doesn't need an actual valid vaccine approval. He just needs a sham approval or, more likely, the victimhood that comes from 'partisan' scientists thwarting his will. 

Regardless, I guarantee Trump won't care at all once the election is over, particularly if he loses. Remember, in 2018 all talk of immigrant caravans and invasion ceased immediately after the polls closed. His attention immediately shifted to worrying about House investigations and impeachment.

The article stirs the pot implying disparity for the disadvantaged. I am a family doctor, and we work hard against disparity. We measure, and have goals to get for instance our African American patients blood pressure down, our Hispanic patients diabetes in control and our young ones vaccinated. But believe me for the first 4 months everyone was afraid to walk into a medical building. 
NYT - you are in a position of trust. Be careful what you imply."
2020-09-24 3:22,"Trump is a master troll. 
How to react to trolls?
My recommendation, watch ""Hacking Your Mind"" on PBS."
2020-09-24 3:04,Just love how Trump accuses others of playing politics when he is one doing it.
2020-09-24 3:05,"Trump sounds like a broken record by continuing to denigrate the work of the C.D.C. and the FDA.  Since he is our leader maybe he would prefer we follow his lead.  Skip all the data and all the advice. Follow Trump's lead and don't wear a mask. Don't do any social-distancing. Is that what he wants us to do? 

Just a word of warning;  Since he doesn't take any responsibility for anything related to this pandemic, he  will feel no sympathy if you or your loved  become infected or die."
2020-09-24 3:24,I certainly will not be getting the Trump Vaccine.
2020-09-24 4:01,"Vaccine before election, after election, doesn’t matter. Having a 6-3 court to decide election, that’s the ticket."
2020-09-24 4:45,"We have forgot what reasonable discourse is like. Instead the public discussion always begins with some assertion that frames the issue as the speaker wishes, without any effort to support it, and defies anyone to disprove it, if anyone does, the response is to evade. Nobody is convinced of anything but instead just disagree without any efforts to find common ground because the perception is that discussion will not be reasonable."
2020-09-24 4:09,Trump can personally stab his quick-fix vaccine to every single one of his supporters. I will have no objection to that.
2020-09-24 4:34,"It’s time to call out President Bonespurs on his rush for a vaccine. His entire family, from oldest to youngest, all children, spouses, grandchildren and anyone else even remotely related should be the first inoculated on national television, with no exceptions. Fat chance."
2020-09-24 3:44,"Yes, why can't scientists be more like Donald, driven by pure science ?"
2020-09-24 3:57,Trump is fine as long as his message is taken in and trusted even if it’s utterly false. Trump knows that he who is heard first will be believed before anyone afterwards. Facts that contradict beliefs are not respected.
2020-09-24 6:19,Just release all vaccines now with a warning label that we have no idea what this vaccine may do and a release of liability including waiver of any benefits under any and all health plans of Medicaid or Medicare for adverse effects. I’ll wait for the one approved under the old process. Others now have a choice be an early adopted or wait.
2020-09-24 9:27,"When other elected officials, courts, and governmental agencies change facts to appease a leader, that’s authoritarianism. If you think any industrial leaders will effectively counter this moment, think again. Business is only effective at adapting to governmental regimes to make profit. They are not in business to promote democracy or freedom. Our corporations adapt to every government and political system on the planet no matter the human cost and make money. That’s it. Exxon, Google, Facebook, GM, and Chase have not changed any political system to improve freedom or human rights. Business is not patriotic, but parasitic or symbiotic. The checks and balances of power only exist within the constitutional system. When they fail, that’s it, the authoritarian wins. We are standing on one of the last checks of power, vote while it still counts."
2020-09-24 8:31,"Trump stated he would not allow a peaceful transfer of power after the Nov election. And the US Media, NYT included, loyally parroted Trump’s criminal intent. Clearly US Media has abandoned its role for as the 4th pillar of US Democracy. The peoples of the World are seeing that the fraudster, liar, assaulter of women & criminal who would be Jailed without fail in any other democracy is the preferred choice of the American people as President."
2020-09-24 9:41,"I will die eventually but I will not die ahead of my time because of Trump's failures. Take that to the bank. Like most Americans, I am strong enough to resist arbitrary political pressure to risk myself and my family to appease a demagogue and his sycophants."
2020-09-24 12:26,"Unfortunately, law makers themselves will have to succumb to this virus before anything is done.  Americans have allowed a ruling class of GOP kleptocrats to affect their well-being and security.  No one ever wins in three card monte, except the shill, working with the dealer.  Yet, a line of folks will continue to play and lose, because they are told they are Special.  Not like those other losers.  If its for a few bucks; its a game.  If its your life and the lives of your family, it is delusion.  And the suckers keep lining up."
2020-09-24 6:39,"The guidelines have to be approved by the White House??
Why??  Does  America have no institutions which are staffed by professionals and independent of politicians."
2020-09-24 8:18,Trumpian projection again.  It's so obvious I feel embarrassed for him.
2020-09-24 9:07,"Trump stands alone among world leaders in downplaying the virus. Even Putin looks at it from a medical standpoint. 

But with Trump it's purely political. He surrounds himself with bit players who push his false narrative, and pushes out those who disagree.

It's like the dead aren't real for him. They're numbers on a screen. He can't relate to them as people, parents, brothers, sisters..."
2020-09-24 6:04,"Worried Trump will declare himself a premature, invalid winner? Up to Fox really. Ask them how they plan to announce election night? All networks/platforms should agree not to release until a clear winner is known definitely....maybe next day or even days."
2020-09-24 5:53,"In the interest of building public confidence in their vaccines, the four companies with stage three trials in progress in the U.S. should announce now that November 4, 2020 is the earliest date they would apply for an emergency use authorization in the United States.  This would sideline the labradoodle guy and the radiologist in the White House as well as not-Dr. Donald Trump.  The four years that I attended the Wharton School included the two years that Trump was there.  He was not taking any medical school classes at Penn.

November 4 appears far too early for the Johnson & Johnson vaccine in any event, and the logistics of the cold-storage dependent vaccines are a work in progress."
2020-09-24 13:34,Viewed against Trump's anti-science crusade and disastrous covid response it was not unusual if Trump tries to undercut FDA's regulatory effort to ensure safe vaccine development or the guidelines to ensure public health.
2020-09-24 11:09,"Is no-one else picking up on the fact this is Trump's buddy whom he appointed as US ambassador to the UK! 
Quote: Robert Wood ""Woody"" Johnson IV is an American businessman and, since 2017, the United States Ambassador to the United Kingdom. He is a great-grandson of Robert Wood Johnson I, and a billionaire heir to the Johnson & Johnson pharmaceutical fortune"
2020-09-24 8:19,"Yep. Trump insures that politics will dictate  what the FDA does about vaccines, ensuring that only moves designed to get him re-elected will be tolerated.   Anything that helps America will have to be vetted as to whether it gets Trump re-elected.  If it does not, it will have to take second fiddle."
2020-09-24 9:31,"Politics aside, from a public health stand point a timely vaccine against Coronavirus 2 that could drastically alter the course of the pandemic and significantly contain the spread is highly desirable. Only 2 viral diseases out of the many have been eradicated to-date, smallpox and Rinderpest. Do we need a vaccine with the urgency of now or warpspeed? Yes. Then what are we splitting hair for? We know that the FDA red tape is well known and a massive hurdle to developing drugs and vaccine. The intention is to be methodical and stringent which is fine in normal circumstances but these are not normal circumstances. People are dying and the virus is spreading the impatience is fully justified. The Trump administration has poured billions of tax payer monies on the vaccine enterprise and expecting some accountability is not unfair but in order. 

On the other side of the world, the red square in Moscow, the seat of the Russian government cut the red tape and boldly has introduced its Sputnik vaccine and is hoping to not only immunize millions in Russia but also around the world starting with the BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa) nations which includes 3 of the most populated countries in the world. I have in the past collaborated with Russian scientists and I respect their creativity and innovative spirit. Multi-million dollar deals have been made by Russia with Indian companies to supply 300 million doses in India. Patience is running thin and rightly so."
2020-09-24 14:22,"Again, accusing others of what he is doing.  Trump is accusing the CDC of politicizing the vaccine response.  Because he is, and has been from day one."
2020-09-24 6:42,"How does a country come out of this? 

This ultra-super-hyper politicization of everything and everybody? Government is supposed to be run by bureaucrats. We may not like them, because they are bureaucratic, but that just means they follow the laws.

Now imagine that your local bureaucrat is driven by party politics. You come to the DMV to get your car re-licensed, he sees a Biden bumper sticker and fails you for that. Or you want to get the Covid-19 vaccine, but you have to certify on a form that you voted for Donald Trump.

Fantasy? Not after today! Not after suggesting to ""throw out the ballots"".

And it's the same with the CDC and the FDA. Can you still trust them? We know that the CDC website is actively controlled and changed by the HHS and therefor the WH. What does Alex Azar know about airborne pathogens? Nothing!

Trump wants, Trump NEEDS - in his mind - the FDA to release a vaccine in the next 30 days or so. He thinks that will divert from the 200.000+ dead Americans - it won't. He also wants and needs a conservative SCOTUS to legitimize the Second Civil War that he again plainly announced today.

How can a country recover from that level of evil? It can't. Goodbye ""United States of America"", it was nice knowing you. Hello ""Fourth Reich"", ""Trumplandia"" or ""North American Empire"" or whatever will come out on the other side.

If you voted for Trump in 2016 based on ""...let's give him a chance..."" you now know that _YOU_ gave THAT chance - and he took it!"
2020-09-24 0:13,"So trump thinks the FDA will hold up a vaccine to make a political point. 

First of all, if they were to do it for that reason, one could argue they were just trying to get a little even with trump for all his meddling over the last few months. 

But more likely they are just being safe. Remember Jerry Ford approved a vaccine too quickly and it led to many case of Guillain  Barre syndrome and deaths. 

Trump’s meddling with the doctors and scientists after his inactions caused a large percentage of our 200,000 deaths, is just one more reason to have trump lose by a landslide. 

Remember what trump has done and vote."
2020-09-24 0:03,"The President's destruction of every institution - every aspect - of our society has grown from a bonfire...to a conflagration. 

His scorched earth attitude applies to everyone and everything...nothing and no one is sacred.

His management of the virus is a complete and total failure and thousands of of our fellow American's lives might have been saved...that's the reality.

And part of the responsibility is on us...for our passivity and our pretending to be asleep.

More frightening than the President...is the millions and millions of Americans who are following him right over the cliff.

Without our humanity, we will possess nothing of value...no matter what else we possess we believe is of value.

And our acquiescence to Trump and the Republican Senators is  stripping away everything we value...including our humanity."
2020-09-24 1:43,"I spent the last twenty years of my life developing medicines and vaccines for approval by FDA, Europe, and Japan for Sanofi, Pfizer, and others. Now retired in Mexico, I look forward to taking a vaccine with EU approval because I can’t be sure a vaccine approved by the FDA is safe or effective enough. I can’t believe iIm writing this"
2020-09-24 3:54,"I can’t believe it still sounds crazy to me, but it is. That a person can be so outrageously reckless that every single chance they get to address an issue correctly is crushed. Trump has had so many opportunities to address the pandemic and every single time he undermines the very people who are trying to get us past it. It is the most ridiculous self-sabotage I have ever seen."
2020-09-24 0:35,"For someone who wants to re-energize the American economy, Mr. Trump is going about it all wrong.  Fifty percent of American do not trust a potential coronavirus vaccine since they do not trust the efficacy and safety data.  It will take well performed and transparent clinical trials monitored by an independent Data Safety Monitoring Board to obtain supporting data for any vaccine.  The information will need to be vetted by career FDA scientists and a scientific Advisory Committee.  At that time, and only at that time, should a vaccine be approved.
Once the the vetted data are made public, American physicians will feel more comfortable recommending the approved vaccine for their patients.  Patients will more likely listen and comply.  Nothing Trump can say, or do, will change these facts."
2020-09-24 18:20,"Is a vaccine even necessary? We are so focused on antibodies. Even if you don't have antibodies you've still been exposed to this thing. It is no longer a novel virus. That's why when there are people who now do contract it they are either asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic. True, like most coronaviruses immunity will wane. But more and more it becomes just a run of the mill virus.  Eventually even the worst hurricanes Peter out as thunderstorms. Indeed for everyone under 80 it already is. Anecdotal cases aside, just look at the hospitalization, ICU, ventilator, and mortality rates. Oh right, we can't until November 4th. Then all will magically start to improve using data we've had for months."
2020-09-24 18:11,"This is yet another distraction on top of  a distraction to control the narrative of the day. Trump states what may be the most dangerous threat to our democracy by calling, ""ballots a disaster"" and ""get rid of the ballots and there won't be a transfer [of power] , frankly there will be a continuation"",  and he pivots in attacking yet another U.S. institution to keep the media and the electorate in the fog of chaos. He cunningly and masterfully creates so much overwhelming turmoil, that it prevents anyone or any lawful institution to hold him accountable for the abundance of threatening statements he makes."
2020-09-24 15:31,"""Hahn says F.D.A. decisions are based on science and the agency would 'not permit any pressure from anyone to change that.' ""

Any of us can list out for ourselves without really trying three or four ways that this bunch has politicized the FDA, CDC, etc. Their dishonesty is unprecedented. We would need much more than a ""Hahn says,"" before we would ever trust them."
2020-09-22 18:20,"Hospitals, nursing homes and care facilities still struggle to get the gear they need.  Kushner put a team of inexperienced volunteers in charge of securing supplies - we know how well that worked.  Testing issues are still rampant and colleges are having testing supplies commandeered  by the Feds.   

We're the richest country in the world and the most basic needs aren't being met.    If Trump had been in charge during WWII we'd be a province of another nation now."
2020-09-22 18:38,"Why didn't Trump use the DPA where and when it was needed -- for providing PPE for first-responders and deploying a nationwide strategic program for testing, tracing, and isolating the virus? That could have and should have been done in January and February, when so many pandemic experts across the country and around the world were publicly calling for it. We still don't have those essential tools, thanks to Trump's inaction.

The reason this president has been such a dismal failure is he fails to do what is necessary WHEN it is necessary. He's all vague campaign rhetoric and half-measures, like the loophole-riddled ""China travel ban"" that came weeks after the virus had already been detected in America and tested no one coming into the country. Even after it was announced, more than 40,000 travelers came in from China. 

We are never going to be able to manage this pandemic, or the economic disaster the federal government's indifference and ineptitude has inflicted on the country, as long as Donald Trump remains in office. Forging fake medical ""guidance"" and presenting unreliable, incomplete casualty/infection numbers as though they came from the CDC will not ""re-open"" the economy or save a single life."
2020-09-22 20:37,It was used when needed.  Most corporations stood up and did what the task force asked.
2020-09-22 20:48,"That military contractors had been ""financially weakened by virus-related disruptions"" doesn't negate the fact that those funds were allocated by Congress for emergency use to obtain needed medical supplies but instead was blown on military contractors. 

Corporations are where Republican priorities will ALways be, and never ever with the well-being of every day Americans. 

The financial well-being of military contractors over the health, safety, and well-being of health care workers during a pandemic. Take all the time you need to think about that. Then vote like the life of a loved one depends on it."
2020-09-22 20:52,"The problem with using the DPA is simple: we simply don't have the on-shore manufacturing capacity any more.  Thanks to globalization, we've shut down most of our factories, and outsourced production to foreign lands, most notably China.  For example, most medicine consumed in the US is from China.

Globalization has benefited the economy by lowering the costs of products, often dramatically.  But there's been a heavy price that we all have paid.  Even today we don't have enough masks, PPE, tests, and many other essential goods to meet the needs of the pandemic.  One cannot use the DPA to order a factory that makes automobile transmissions to turn on a dime and start making ventilators instead.

Going forward, we need to rethink how globalization will be managed.  I'm a strong advocate of regulated, market-based capitalism.  But consideration of national security should be much more important in the future than it has been in the recent past."
2020-09-22 20:59,"After spending a career in the Public Health Service, I believe that the missions of the military, private-for-profit corporations and public health have gaps that cannot be bridged with current levels of corruption, ineptness and selfishness. If only the nation had been prepared with enough n95 masks and wise, compassionate leadership, then the US would not be so exceptional in it's standing as number one for covid morbidity & mortality."
2020-09-22 21:28,"3M, a major manufacturer of N95 masks in Minnesota, could have built another plant and hired those needed to make them by now if Trump had used the Defense Protection Act to fund it at the beginning of this pandemic. These masks are less complicated then the respirators built in the GM plants. Why wouldn't Trump, or the Republicans, fund such a simple, yet life saving mask? The only possible answers might be: They really do not care about U.S. citizens; They do not wear masks and thereby keep the U.S. #1 with the most deaths; There is a profit to be made by some Republican from not funding this effort. Money has always been more important then Pro-life and saving lives with the Republican Party."
2020-09-22 18:47,"Wouldn't it have been   more convincing  simply to append  a third column to the table on page 2 of the WH report (whose link is in the article) that made clear to the reader  what each  authorization of DPA amounted to in dollars and what it was actually intending  to accomplish,  rather than have to wade through  this discussion in which one can
easily get lost following the different allocations? 

This would have made the assertion ""Yet all but six of the 
examples cited..."" much more damning."
2020-09-22 20:30,"I like comparing Trump's approach in the early months with that of Israel's Netanyahu during the early months. An article I found at- <a href=""https://www.timesofisrael.com/why-trump-and-netanyahu-handle-the-coronavirus-outbreak-in-very-different-ways"" target=""_blank"">https://www.timesofisrael.com/why-trump-and-netanyahu-handle-the-coronavirus-outbreak-in-very-different-ways</a>/   does that and I did a post on my blog about it at- <a href=""https://theblackandthegreen2.blogspot.com/2020/04/trump-netanyahu-and-covid-19-coronavirus.html"" target=""_blank"">https://theblackandthegreen2.blogspot.com/2020/04/trump-netanyahu-and-covid-19-coronavirus.html</a> . The blog post has a lot of information not included in the TOI article, including about how Netanyahu did a better job producing ventilators by mostly using the public sector than Trump did using the private sector (that's in paragraph 5). Also, if you do a little math, it turns out that if Netanyahu were in the White House there'd be only about 17,000 deaths here and we just passed 200,000. 

I don't do this comparison because I like Netanyahu, I don't like him. But it might be a good way to attack Trump because he's not going to dismiss Netanyahu as a socialist or weak or something like that, they're best friends. He might have nothing to say in response. In the spring I  said “I think it might help if people start pointing out that it's okay for a ""tough-guy,"" right-wing, capitalist, racist idiot to take Coronavirus seriously.”

2020-09-22 20:20,"Of course Putin favors and is helping Trump get re-elected. He obviously knows stuff about trump, both criminal and embarrassing personal stuff. Trump is his free chicken, and he can benefit a lot by having someone in the WH who cannot do a thing about him."
2020-09-22 21:24,Oh yeah? Where are all the N95 masks then?
2020-09-22 19:03,"The news cycle is such that even after Trump is heard on tape for the entire nation to listen to, acknowledging the airborne transmissibility there appears to be little outrage. 
 This is what ensues when enough of the uneducated and undereducated elect an incompetent, sadistic megalomaniac.  Trump's hubris will not allow for any introspection to realize he is morally culpable for the extreme suffering, 200,000 souls gone and the relegation of the elderly to live as shut-ins to increase survivability.  His arrogance and blind ignorance or repudiation of science to facilitate his re-election is rewarded by the GOP minions."
2020-09-22 20:24,"""But ventilators!! We made ventilators."""
2020-09-22 19:32,"In order to use the DPA, Donald Trump would have to  engage in the detail of the matter to a level sufficient to enable him to understand what is going on and then make decisions informed by that understanding.   And he’d have to interrupt his busy schedule of Twitter, Fox & Friends and golf!  

Or he could of course make it up as he goes along, just as he is doing with TikTok.  At least in that example people aren’t dying in their thousands."
2020-09-22 19:42,"Every American should have been given an n95 mask by now. Trump is not interested in saving lives. He is more interested in reinforcing and spinning to his base that only watches and hears the lies on Fox news and listens to right wing radio. Trump and the GOP only deliver for the very rich donors and they  could care less if Trump is killing the rest of us.

A used car salesman has more morals than Trump."
2020-09-22 19:02,"Yes... really is time for the Federal government and the Federal Reserve Board both to get out of bed with Wall Street.  (I am particularly anti Jerome Powell's various actions -- buying junque bonds with tax payer $$ and promising zero interest rates until 2023.)  We don't have a democracy in as much as we have the electoral college.  Lobbyist have written a law or two (or three?) and Boeing did its own safety checks on the  737 Max if I am correct.

Right now, BTW we really don't know a lot about Covid.  We know something about prevention -- keep your nose and mouth  behind three layers of mask - (i wear four layers just to be sure), get enough rest and exercise and eat things that are relatively wholesome and maintain a reasonable weight in terms of your BMI -- you want to stay in the normal range if possible- not too much carb (starch or sugar) which raises your blood sugar level and-- all of this causes inflammation which is what seems to make us more susceptible to whatever is going around.  Avoid large indoor gatherings and crowded outdoor ones where people are unmasked.  

We don't know much about how the therapeutics work -- when in the cycle of the disease are they most effective and exactly how effective are they!  

It's handy to rail at Trump  but it does NADA.    I know commonsense isn't taught in school, but supposedly choice and personal responsibility are part of elementary school social studies units.  ""Ask not what your country can do for you..!"""
2020-09-22 20:58,"No amount of gaslighting can hide the brutal truth. The Trump administration utterly failed this country by not approaching Covid19 from a national level in early March. Leaving the decisions up to governors served two purposes.
1. All blame could be placed on states, not the White House.
2. Corporations would not be burdened.
Result? 50 states=50 plans=chaos.
There is still no national strategy from the White House, only blame and lies."
2020-09-22 18:48,"Trump does not have the mental fitness to be a war-time President, to put in charge of artillery Jared Kushner or have Wilbur Ross as appropriations to National Defense, please, the one thing that has been learned is that the US is being governed by ineptness and arrogance, unfortunately, this does not simply pertain to Trump.
Every hour of every day not only is the US subjected to the antics of Donald Trump but so is the international community and frankly, we find him too childish to pay attention to his briefings, his rallies, and his ramblings, yet we wonder where are the caretakers to this stable genius who seems to know more than generals, scientists, economists, yet his incompetency is so upfront that you can't ignore it, nor can you ignore the derogatory comments coming thru regarding those who oppose him, he is certainly delusional to think that he could survive a war, he can't even manage a pandemic while the majority of the G7 have gotten a good handle on things, most countries have made certain that the US needs to isolate should they enter a country that has relatively controlled COVID, that is provided there is justification in order to do entry. Most countries have learned how to share COVID information and how to help each other during the worst times, most countries learn while they study those that have managed this crippling deadly disease, not the US after all everything is America First, no, it should be Teamwork such as has been in military wars"

Only when that segment of the population is affected ... does Trump take any substantive action."
2020-09-22 20:16,"N-95s are one of the greatest failures in this sorry mess.  If Trump had done the simple math to figure out what medical workers needed and then how to make enough available to the public, you'd have lots of people (like me) wearing them and helping to limit the spread of the virus.

Conservatives constantly rant about government mandates.  In this case, govt could have ENABLED individuals to help the situation.  Trump decided they weren't going to do that."

2020-09-22 22:22,The Defense Production Act is not anti-business. It addresses an old flaw in markets and the conflicts which business executives and managers have when public need opposes fiduciary responsibilities. The businesses get the compensation they request which does not greatly exceed what they normally charge but allows for having to produce what the government requests on time. The business executives and managers are relieved of responsibility to equity holders. Everybody wins.
2020-09-22 22:31,I always am astounded how Trump is like a child who either gets caught in the cookie jar and then lies about it or failure to address  an assigned household chore and then lies again. The Nation does not deserve this continuous complicity.

Oh yes, the boy wonder (i.e., Jared Kushner) can also share the blame as he was supposedly charged with overseeing supply chains. Shameful and tragic but entirely preventable, just look at South Korea for example."

With a death toll rapidly approaching  200,000 innocent Americans, the trump administration is still criminally negligent in meeting basic needs of citizens.
Business is complicit in doing very little while enriching the 1%.

 It doesn't take a mind reader to see it."
2020-09-22 22:16,"Trump misrepresents what he has done with regards the Defense Production Act. I am shocked, shocked! 

When he announced that he was going to use it business executives convinced him not to do so, they would produce all that was needed. They lied but Trump was okay with that as long as they considered him, their guy.

Trump has the conscience of a crocodile, he doesn’t have a conscience."
2020-09-22 21:59,"Most affected groups they thought would be:blacks, browns and elderly...none of which they care about. Trump, miller, all are racist and the elderly cannot help them much..so nothing to lose by letting them die.
Not the America we all love!"
2020-09-22 23:29,"If the President has done everything he can to ramp up production of PPE, why are medical professionals -- and the general public -- still unable to secure all the anti-viral surgical masks and the n95 respirators they need to stay safe? 

It's been more than six months!  How much time does American manufacturing need to produce these relatively simple technologies?  Is this country really in such terrible shape that it cannot even produce a simple life-saving mask for all Americans?

If this is all the president has to brag about, the president is in more serious trouble than even I thought."
2020-09-22 23:43,The article has a good point about Kodak.  The use of the people's money somehow caused a meteoric rise in stock that benefited insiders... and has Kodak actually made any chemicals?  Moderna again had the insiders selling at peak.  Other money was evidently used to reward supporters of el presidente via Kushner.  The takeaway is that covid is an opportunity for enrichment.  I wonder what karma will have to say.

2020-09-22 23:24,"I volunteered to work in a Covid unit in the beginning, and I'll do it again when it comes back to Massachusetts. All of my healthcare colleagues feel the same way. We will do whatever it takes.

To my dying day, I will never understand why masks became political in the US, as it is simply stupid. I know, it's rude to call fellow citizens stupid, but not wearing masks during a respiratory virus pandemic IS stupid. It's the definition of stupid.

And I will never understand why the US did not take control of our PPE supply. Instead, Trump implied that healthcare workers were stealing PPE. We laughed about that in the Covid unit, as we were putting on our gear.

We are better than this."

-Donald Trump, March 18, 2020

Under Trump's ""wartime"" leadership, more Americans have died on American soil, from Covid 19, than the  combined wartime American deaths in World War I, Korea, Vietnam, Afghanistan and Iraq. 

And not a single shot has been fired."
2020-09-23 15:25,"Interesting that this article makes no mention of Jared Kushner being in charge of the Covid19 Task Force and famously telling Governors that the states are entirely on their own for securing supplies; this was in March.

It is interesting to know the Defense Production Act is routinely invoked by the Defense Department itself; the president is disengenous when he claims he invoked it but in fact has not deployed it where it is really needed: on testing supplies and PPE."
2020-09-23 14:44,"300,000 uses of DPA by the defense department in one year? It's grossly unreal. No decisive national action ensuring safe equipment for healthcare workers just means they and the PPE companies are simply not lobbying and lining enough pockets at Kushner and Trump Inc. The term transactional simply doesn't describe the situation fairly, it's more like illegal."
2020-09-17 11:51,"CDC Redfield is a two timer.  

One minute he’s like a pup dog bowing to Trump’s non mask wearing mindset, then he tries to tell us wearing masks might be better than vaccine.  

Another minute Trump tells us a vaccine is right around the corner and then Redfield maybe tries to tell the truth - safe vaccine maybe not until 2021 third quarter for millions.  

Then - Trump declares Redfield misunderstood questions regarding COVID protocol and later Redfield goes along with it.

Birx is taking her scarves on the road trying to convince college kids to behave and wear masks to keep safe.  We don’t see her these days.  Fauci appears on talk shows and intermittently we see him on TV and hear a bit of truth, far from The Donald. 

Redfield, it seems, wants to tell the truth, maybe, but he just can’t whole heartedly let the truth slip from his lips totally without pulling back.  He’s obeying the “heel, sit, stay” commands of that Trump dog leash."
2020-09-17 11:23,"At this point I will not trust any American developed COVID-19 vaccine because of Herr Trump's pressuring of both federal approval agencies and his pressuring of pharmaceutical companies to minimize testing and release a product so Herr Trump has a feather in his cap for the election.  I also do not trust Big Pharma because of the billions of dollars involved and the one who is first will see stock prices soar.

Because of all this, the resulting vaccine will at best be minimally effective and at worse out right dangerous to some.  Basically more lives will be put in jeopardy in the name of profits, stock prices, and egos!"
2020-09-17 12:20,"Scientists repeatedly tell us that masks mainly protect others-not the wearer. Now Redfield tells Congress wearing a mask protects him even more than a vaccine could. No wonder folks are skeptical of our ""medical professionals"""
2020-09-17 12:09,"I'm with Joe Biden: I won't sign on to receive any vaccine being pushed by a president desperate to maintain his fantasy that everything is peachy keen with the pandemic.

Unless it's vetted by a  cadre of trusted scientists, many of whom are still speaking out so at least we hear their guidance, common sense dictates whom to believe.

It's a sorry state of affairs when the only truth we hear is from a CDC director under oath, afraid to even look a the camera, and hours away from a slap-down from a devious president.

Dr. Redfield is a weak man, the sort the president loves because he can always count on forcing him to eat his words.  My rule of thumb?  If the president attacks a public official, said official is probably worth trusting."
2020-09-17 12:29,"Our public healthcare officials seem useless to face Trump's cross examination.  They lost their confidence and became incapable to speak the truth. One minute they talk about the reality.  In another minute they try to patch and mend the difference between their statements and Trump's statements.  

Where is honesty and integrity when we need them the most.  They think they still provide a good service to the people.  In fact, they just enable Trump to keep telling unchecked and untrue statements to the public. It is a disaster in the making.  

The worst thing is that our healthcare officials seem to give up fighting to stop the virus and just stay afloat to wait for the vaccine."
2020-09-17 12:29,"Let all the Trumpers be the guinea pigs for a vaccine.  I’m getting through the pandemic just fine right now and I’m not going to see all of my precautions to date upset by some noxious Election Day potion.

2020-09-17 11:49,"Back in February/March all the leading scientists told us that an optimistic assumption for a vaccine was around 12-18 months. Moderna seems to be proving them right.

2020-09-17 11:18,"This article should be required reading for all NYTimes readers - "" ""Drugmaker Shares Details of Its Vaccine Trial""
This particular article is about the drug company Moderna.Moderna has its own researchers, scientists, and doctors working on a vaccine. So does JNJ, AstraZeneca, and Pfizer. 
Point being, its not Donald Trump in a board room in the White house developing these treatments or vaccines. So proclaiming that you cant trust any vaccine touted by President Trump is not only ridiculous, its dangerous. Sowing doubt when we need to get this virus eradicated puts a lot of lives at risk. 
And Im sure you would all like to see Biden win the election, and if the vaccines come out afterwards, he gets all the credit, because they ""came out on his watch"", but if they come out before, Trump gets the credit, and he'll win the election.
Small price to pay for saving lives right? Or is it?"
2020-09-17 12:47,"I don't spend my days thinking about a vaccine. I don't even expect one to come although there will likely be a vaccine or vaccines sooner or later. When one is developed it will be a relief to all of us. When it comes, it comes. It won't be a miracle and it won't return the world back to where it was before Covid 19. Some people will make a ton of money from it. Many people will not get vaccinated. Many people will be unable to afford it.  So I wear a mask and gloves. I was my hands a lot and I keep my distance from others. Otherwise, I stopped thinking about the virus months ago."
2020-09-17 12:59,"I'm glad that Moderna, at least, is releasing details of it's study.  All other companies working on a vaccine as part of Trump's Warp Speed program must the same.  The timing aligns with initial estimates of when a vaccine would be ready for use and is far beyond election day so it appears that the company is relying on science, rather than government pressure for their timeline.

I am not an anti-vaxxer.  I get a flu shot every year and believe that vaccines are vital for public safety, however I will not take any vaccine that doesn't release details of their vaccine trials."
2020-09-17 13:01,"I fully expect to that Trump will announce later today that Moderna is confused and mistaken and that the trial will be finished very soon, probably before that important date.

I will never vote for a Republican again."

Trump says a vaccine will be distributed to the general public within weeks, before Nov. 3.

Which of the above do you believe? The drug company and scientists, or the guy who professes to be a cheerleader?

There is no danger if you believe the first group, but tremendous danger if you believe the cheerleader. You pick."

Even then, I might wait 6 months or so to see if any unsuspected side effects developed."
2020-09-17 13:16,"My wife and I have been preparing for this lengthy wait since March 25th.  We have self isolated primarily because the President has downplayed the deadliness of this virus, and he has millions of followers that accept his judgement.  Which is tragic.

We cannot go out because so many others ignore the science and medical community, no different than climate change.

I expect that this time next year we will still be self isolated, even with a President Biden, millions will still be listening to ex-President Trump's rhetoric and lies."

To be still on the job, no matter how prestigious the post (does he really need the salary to make hard ends meet?) after having his scientific observations questioned by a quack is beyond unsettling. He “misunderstood?” No; he acquiesced to this T-Rex of a boss who was out hunting prey: the truth.

Is this an effect of being holed up for 6 months?"
2020-09-17 13:34,"Since the Reagan era, greed has consumed america including the healthcare/medical community.  The constant shifting of care that people get is in large part based on profit.  Just look at any private hospital in any major metropolitan area.  Mt Sinai is a giant not because of altruism but to raid smaller less profitable hospitals and turn them into money makers.  It is why MD practices are being bought up by equity firms while turning doctors into cash. 
The same is true of drug companies but maybe more so.  Think about Vioxx.  A very effective pain medication for osteoarthritis was taken off the market because it was way overprescribed.  The company, Merck, knew it was dangerous for patients with heart conditions but made a business calculus, what is the potential profit from massive use vs the liability of getting sued for causing some deaths.  
The opiod crisis was based on the same thinking from the Sackler family and look where we are now.  Suing the family for all the deaths while trying to find the money they hid away to shield themselves from monetary damages.
If anyone thinks those manufacturers fighting for the vaccine money, and there is a lot of it, are doing it for the good of mankind or womankind they are living in days long past when patents were for business and not medicine.  When doctors shared information to help patients and did it for free.
Now the healthcare system is about money because it is run by capitalists.
Beware any vaccine coming out too quickly"

2020-09-17 14:04,The vaccine will be rolled out on Trump’s orders. No one with any sense will take it this early in the game. This would be the first RNA vaccine - it’s not a proven technique. The cells are supposed to  produce proteins to induce immunity.  How much will be produced and will the body clear them before immunization? A fifty percent effectiveness rate is not encouraging. How will Moderna know if it immunizes? The only way is to expose the subject to the virus themselves - certainly a risky procedure and if the NYT article is correct vaccine recipients are supposed to expose themselves. Too many variables to say if this is an effective vaccine. Perfect as a Trump prop and Moderna makes millions if not billions.
2020-09-17 14:12,I am glad that moderna is releasing it. But they should be prepared to face with all sorts of doubts and challenges in a highly charged political environment where even science is being used and doubted by both sides. I won’t be surprised if Democrats create doubts about this or any potential treatment that is released before elections. No matter how effective it may be Dems don’t want it to be released before elections . They would rather let people suffer than miss an opportunity to blame Trump.

You can't respect nor trust any of these people to do the humble humane empathetic right thing regarding COVID-19 aka novel coronavirus-19 aka SARS-2 aka COV-SARS-2.

I declined to participate in a COVID-19 clinical trial after receiving an unsolicited written invitation letter. Because of my age, Black African male age color aka race ethnic national origin and multiple chronic underlying health medical maladies.

That is what the Democrats should accept, half a loaf or nothing.

The economy is depressed in a way that it has not been in any time in memory. There will be no more jobs and people employed until the economy has recovered and letting people go hungry and homeless is just going to make the recovery longer. The loss of wealth is as inescapable as that from a hurricane. The only path left is assuring a faster recovery by keeping people able to consume and to resume work as soon as they may. That means supporting people until the pandemic is past."

2020-09-17 21:20,"It is immensely frustrating to read article after article on pandemic relief that speak of the cost of such a bill. Yes, there will be a certain amount of spending, but there is no cost.

Let's look at the Democrat's $3.4 TRILLION pandemic relief bill. The way it works, as soon as the President signs the bill, someone at the Fed goes over to a keyboard, hits a few keys, and the funds immediately appear in the Treasury's account at the Fed. 

There are no new taxes, no new borrowing, no cost at all. 

It has to work this way because we cannot wait for a tax bill to be passed and the money collected or for the Treasury to arrange for a sale of bonds and the bonds to be sold. We needed the money immediately. In fact, this is the way it works for ALL appropriations bills. 

In normal times, there might be some indirect costs, because dropping that much money into the economy might cause excess inflation, but in today's pandemic economy in which money is in short supply, inflation is 1% or less and the trend line is DOWN. We could probably send $10 TRILLION to the people who need it without significant inflation. 

The budget of the federal government is very, very different from your household budget (unless you have a printing press in your basement)."

Meet them halfway? No, they couldn’t even bring their 1T plan to a vote as even Republicans balked at that. So they dropped their bill to 0.6T and that of course failed as well. 

I believe the 1.5 T compromise by the bipartisan group in the House is a good starting point for negotiations. Pelosi should get stuck on a number but maintain the basic Democratic priorities (aid to the unemployed, families, children, healthcare and The states) to get help to people now.

This is holding the people hostage for politicians’ gain when almost the entire nation and it’s businesses need financial help and leadership. I had some hope at the start of the crisis the congress would get together and step up: that hope has burned up like the forests in my state.

2020-09-17 19:14,"The Democrats need to accept the inadequate amounts that Republicans are offering. Any money is better than none. 

The Democrats know that the Republicans are not trying to keep this country from sinking into a long and difficult economic crisis because they want to think that by avoiding spending borrowed money they can assure continued prosperity. They think that those with the most wealth are those who produce wealth and all others are just dependent upon them. Reactionary thinking that was reintroduced by Republicans after the 1970’s.

The Republicans are still incapable of accepting realities which they do not wish to accept. Our economy depends upon continuous growth which depends upon continuous increasing consumption and production which requires all to prosper not just the wealthy. We cannot avoid losing tremendous amounts of existing wealth under the circumstances but we must work to recover as soon as we can and that means keeping all able to participate which means keeping them from slipping into poverty.

The Republicans offer is penny wise but dollar stupid. But it is the best that be had, for now."

Allowing Trump and Meadows, the woebegone Mitch, a gaggle of spineless acolytes to apply ugly labels, use misleading names and characterizations, to harangue about ""the end of capitalism"" is to fail to fight the fight.

I'm glad Nancy is sticking to her guns, kind of, but I'd be gladder if she was fighting as if she feels some urgency to win.

Since late February and early March, much of the Department of State has been vacant.  Most people are telecommuting, and even those who must come in to read sensitive cables that can only be seen on highly classified computer systems can come in 2 to 3 times a week.￼

The cafeteria, which was once a bustling center of activity with thousands of people seated every day, is now a ghost town, with one cashier, and all food pre-prepared in boxes.

My colleagues tell me that in their particular bureau, regular staffing will not return to normal levels until sometime early next year.

Yet with one of the most important federal bureaucracies operating on such minimal staffing, it’s difficult for me to imagine that a new Trump administration will not eviscerate both the civil and foreign service — at State, but also throughout the government.￼￼￼￼"

Even larger donors than lobbyists in fossil fuel industries and wealthy corporations. So it's no surprise that politicians feel like they need to cater to teachers unions selfish demands. I'm a left wing voter and supporter of private employer unions. But the craven and opportunistic teachers unions here in the US need to be abolished.

I am a physician who was a pediatric practitioner, worked as a clinical reviewer at the FDA and in the pharmaceutical industry in clinical drug development.

I am waiting to read the conclusions, benefit-risk assessment and recommendations for regulatory action (for or against approval) that is part of the clinical review of a vaccine candidate, before I take any of these vaccines.   By federal regulation, the efficacy and safety data have to be made available promptly at approval.  These documents are available online for many approved vaccines on the FDA website.

However, if the FDA Commissioner allows rapid ""emergency use authorizations"" for COVID-19 vaccines, these reviews will NOT be completed before the vaccines are pushed into the CDC's recommended immunization schedule, leading to wide distribution to health departments, pharmacies and physicians.

October 22, FDA's Vaccines and Related Biologics Advisory Group, an collection of independent experts, is to meet to discuss issues involving COVID-19 vaccines.  I plan to try to listen to that meeting.  It will be interesting to hear how many of those experts (at least those without close ties to vaccine manufacturers) are comfortable with the status of the various vaccine candidates and the plans (seemingly) to rush them into wide clinical use."

Hardly anyone wears a mask outdoors now.  Perhaps folks are convinced the virus is an indoor pet and doesn't go outside and spread via airborne droplets?

The feeling seems to be that Covid is like that clueless party guest who just doesn't realize it's time to go so if you ignore him he'll eventually leave!

Meanwhile, much of the country seems to share the same sentiment even as one reads increasing alarms both here and abroad.  Just today the WHO (remember those ""losers""?) warned Europe of rising contagion numbers.  Similarly, Canada's Health Minister is ringing alarms.

Meanwhile our own Clueless-in-Chief is still holding his mask-less rallies and telling us all there's nothing to worry about.  After all, he's got a magic Trump-tonic Vaccine that will be ready for us next month.

Heck, he's so concerned about mail-in voting that he's only going to let those good Republicans who stand in-line at the polling places to get a shot!

I see all this and don't know whether to be filled with despair or just laugh at it all.

But it took years to develop other vaccines. I can’t think that researchers really know enough about this virus to really be able to thwart it with a vaccine next month, or even next year.  What they would have to do to reassure me that the vaccine is safe, I do not know. I’m not really sure why there’s a poll about the vaccine, or why anybody would be surprised that that results are surprising.  What is the point of trying to get people to decide on something even before it exists... except to stir up some unnecessary conflict?  “Even if there is a vaccine most people won’t take it” is just weird speculation... unnecessary, and potentially damaging... hardening people’s views even before such a thing as a vaccine exists."

3) Every interview with every Republican, including in my fantasy Trump included, should ask the question “What is the point of the presidency? What are the responsibilities and expectations of the role?” Followed maybe by a question on how can they consider Donald Trump suitable for that role. But I think the first question would yield some interesting enough answers - ranging from “doesn’t matter” (otherwise how can they accept him as president, 90 percent of the time they just pretend he’s not there) to “king”.

how deep is the collapse, how rapid is the spiraling downward, how corrupting is the desperation to keep power at any

Silence reflects an abject level of moral degeneracy  by far too  many people whose response to this HHS dictate to CDC  is  to think it is all   unfortunate but largely irrelevant to their own lives. They are willing to accept/tolerate this form of 
interference either because they don't care, or they don't want to think of the larger implications for basing public health recommendations upon something purely
political of the basest, most primitive sort. 

The fact that gross lies have been  imposed upon CDC by HHS (did caputo have anything to do with this?) feeds into the 
paranoia that nothing and nobody can be trusted (other than ogre 45 of course), which makes democratic governing impossible. Democracy cannot function when paranoia and fantasy  are too widespread, and lies and truth are so indiscriminately and purposefully mixed that rational decisions by each individual are impossible. 

It is this morass that awaits us to an even   greater extent if ogre 45 is ""reelected"". Don't people realize this and the

I get that this is more evidence of DJT's staggering ineptitude and craven corruption. But what in the world was the CDC thinking? Why wasn't there a stampede to the nearest podium to denounce the falsified reports?

All summer I raised here my growing discomfort with the CDC's inability to make bold claims, stakeout clearcut ground, have consistent messaging, and stand up to the bully in the WH. Schools like mine made the decision, in part, not to test anyone before opening school based on the malign manipulation of the data.

 I still remember the night we were told you didn't need to be tested even if you had been direct, sustained contact with an infected person, and the mass confusion on the evening news as journalists tried to sort out how this could be possible. Now we know why...it wasn't (of course!). 

There is no excuse for those who did not make known earlier what they knew. The lack of proper testing, of knowing when to test and how often is killing us. This was not benign neglect; the fallout from not blowing the whistle earlier that the WH was falsifying the data was deadly.

Redfield should resign tomorrow."

The article names these scientists as involved in the editing: Giroir, Redfield, Fauci, Birx and Atlas. In a separate sentence the article states CDC scientists were not consulted. This is confusing. Redfield is the director of the CDC. And all the others named in the article have medical degrees, but they are not CDC scientists. Are they different in knowledge, integrity or ethics? 

I've come to lump the WH Task Force with the CDC in terms of poor communication of information on the virus and the pandemic and in terms of failing to provide clear, consistent guidance and recommendations. I don't know what Fauci and Birx do when they're not standing with Trump on TV, but I do know the US is in with third world countries in our suffering.

I've followed past epidemics in my training in Epidemiology and Medicine. I took it for granted that whenever there was an epidemic, the CDC director kept us informed with regular TV announcements.

Surprised it's so many.  

During a visit to Little Rock, reported by Eldorado News-Times, Dr. Birx stated:

“‘I’ve been so struck by the number of Americans across the country that have just had it, ‘Mortality decreases’ have also complicated matters …  When people start to realize that 99 percent of us are going to be fine, it becomes more and more difficult to get people to comply.”

She was talking about masks but could just as well have been talking about the Vaccine. 

It's not so easy to catch this Virus, and after that, it's not so easy to also die of it.

Especially since the CDC says the pandemic is over, and that excess deaths are below the epidemic threshold.  Quite a bit below too, likely due to the majority of C19 deaths (94%) occurring with comorbidities, so these people have died earlier than normal.

<a href=""https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/covid19/excess_deaths.htm"" target=""_blank"">https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/covid19/excess_deaths.htm</a>

Consider the Sturgis ""superspreader"" event.  460,000 bikers attended, no one wore masks or did any distancing.  I've seen pictures and every biker was obese and likely had the other comorbidities.  Academics predicted 266,796 infections.

So what happened according to Politifact?  300 new infections and one death.

That's why I'm surprised half of Americans say they'll get an experimental fast-tracked vaccine from manufacturers made immune from lawsuits by Congress.

2020-09-18 4:18,"I do not believe for one moment that the Task Force, as a group, signed off on the absurd advice that a symptomatic people should not be tested.  Tonight on MSNBC with Chris Hayes Dr. Fauci, in a masterful interview, once again stated emphatically that testing was critical and we still were not testing enough. No, this guidance was the brainchild of those in the White House who deny science, do not understand science, are not infection disease specialists, and are more concerned with maintaining their power than saving lives."
2020-09-18 4:28,"The day Trump and his  cronies are ousted should be declared an annual holiday to be sure all of America remembers how close we've come to tyranny.

2020-09-18 4:41,"The CDC has been corrupted and politicized by the Trump administration. This once again demonstrates
Trump’s disdain for science and  his disregard for the need to maintain the highest level of integrity and independence in public health institutions so they can fulfill their mission of protecting the public health. Trump is on a mission to destroy our prosperity, our scientific leadership in the world, and our democracy just to hold onto power and win an election. He wants the CDC to be part of his propaganda campaign and to support his belief that he has done a tremendous job in fighting the pandemic.
That lie is so hard to swallow that it is truly delusional."
2020-09-18 4:42,"How horrible is that?-- Trump political appointees were writing stuff, sticking it on the CDC web site, and trying to pass it off as the work of CDC scientists.

2020-09-18 4:49,"That is so criminal of Trump but what else is new?People have always trusted the CDC. Now what? What's next for our country? Falsifying government documents is not enough to get rid of him? Trying and lying to hurt and kill the American people is not enough to get rid of him?Didn't he take an oath to honor the Constitution? He really is a very very sick man. Sicko, psycho. Soon he will start a war. He's so desperate to win he will do anything. It's all about him all the time."

All he cares about is getting re-elected no matter how many of us die or how many lies he has to tell.   Today Trump illegally made harmful changes to new CDC policy guidelines.   Trump knows he has failed so badly on this virus and he’s busy covering up his massive failures by trying to convince us the virus is nothing to worry about.   No masks, no distancing, crowded bars, schools, workplaces all OK!

Trump believes we are stupid and wants to ignore that already 200,000 Americans have died painful unnecessary deaths.   But we know Trump cannot lie his way out of his massive failure to protect us from this pandemic.   Trump will go down as the worst negligent president ever in America’s history!"

Furthermore, the number of doses of this and the other (locally developed) vaccine ordered exceeds the number needed for our own population, by millions of doses. The excess is intended for small Pacific countries."

Two areas in particular were not supplied, but Mr. Trump had the national-emergency power to compel their production had he wanted to--the N95 masks, the far superior mask used by doctors that is now hard to get and very expensive, and the tests for the Virus, especially rapid-result tests.  Had we been prepared with these two items, and the president not spoiled by his mania that masks are against freedom and should be discouraged, we would be in a far healthier  position today and not overwhelmed by Covid-19, which seems to have gained the upper hand under the Trump administration."

Those may have been assessed elsewhere when they were developing the proprietary component(s) of it, but IMHO, things like using a 2 compartment modeling system, and fleshing out the long term effects using PK <-> PD, are essential to the public health impact of new drugs. Let’s hope they don’t cave to political pressure from above, like what’s being revealed by the NYT with regard to CDC testing guidelines."
2020-09-18 9:49,It makes sense for Joe Biden to focus on the pandemic when it is the central fact of American life.  How does Donald Trump expect to convince us that it isn't?  It's like trying to convince starving people that they're actually well-fed.

The CDC is not there to “message” it is there to inform, and the science says what the science says. If it is contrary to what the president wants it to say that is just too bad, he aught to be following the doctors’ advice based on the latest information available instead of trying to lead things in a direction that he thinks helps his re-election chances.

Instead he regularly proves he will always look out for himself first, second, and third.

All of the agencies that provide information from research, control our financial sector, protect public goods, and enforce our laws and regulation should be completely independent of partisan influence.

Trump is under the impression that less testing will create better statistics which will make him look better. Actually less testing creates more infections and Deaths because asymptomatic  infected people are the bigger danger.
2020-09-18 6:13,"That testing and school reopening guidelines were dumped onto the CDC website by HHS over the strong objection of CDC scientists once again shows how Trump has politicized the worst public health crisis in 100 years.

In 2017 Republicans passed a 2 trillion tax cut for the rich FOR NO REASON. There was no emergency. Now that we face economic collapse and a once in a 100 years health crisis they suddenly care about the deficit?? Why don’t they repeal that tax cut and use the money to pay for Pelosi’s bill? For decades they have cut taxes then cried there’s no money to pay for services. Enough."

What most middle class Americans don’t realize is that the money you pour into your 401k retirement plan is invested in companies like Corrections Corporation of America. It is actually a publicly traded company that profits from contracts with the US government to detain migrants and forces them to endure procedures like hysterectomies to prevent them from having children. This company also profits from imprisoning as many people of color as law enforcement can arrest. So, arresting and imprisoning, as many people as they can. Mostly people of color. Why? It is profitable. Check out your own 401k. There is a reason why the USA has the highest number of incarcerated people in the world. Why? It is profitable for shareholders. Capitalism at its worst."
2020-09-18 8:29,"Republicans have been attacking the public school system for decades. They've mobilized support from the religious right and from the Catholic and Protestant church leadership in particular, disparaging public education as a devious leftist system of anti-religious indoctrination while they lobby for the support of religious schools with tax dollars. Many go so far as to call public schools satanic.

The deeper concern underlying their cynical attack on public schools is to reduce taxes for the rich by privatizing education in America. 

Even subsidized religious education will save them money, because partial subsidization will cost them less than public schools fully funded by tax dollars. Their own kids will go to well-funded schools, of course, and they won't have to pay for other people's kids to get an education -- especially the poor non-white children whom they despise. 

The added benefit to the right-wingers of undermining public education is manifest in the current state of affairs. Millions of anti-science Americans touting ignorance as a virtue are being manipulated with crackbrained conspiracy theories, magical thinking and a simple-minded, shallow and belligerent nationalism. And these form the most reliable and manipulable core of Trump's base. 

Unfortunately, they also bear a disturbing resemblance to populations in Europe in the 1930's whose enthusiasm for strongman governments issued in the most destructive war in human history."

Anyone watching the town hall can see that, while Mr. Biden is old just as is Trump, he is highly capable, had a coherent and common sense vision of what our country needs, is light years more articulate and competent than Trump, and demonstrably more fit - he stood the entire time while Trump sat.  The press does the American people a disservice when it fails to give Mr. Biden his due and give the people all the information they need to cast informed ballots."

Joe embraced climate change and had a plan to slowly get us off of fossil fuel and adjust the economy while doing so while trump has the opposite.

Now that they have revised their guideline on testing, just how readily available will this testing be?

I continue to have less than stellar confidence in this agency these days.  They were once considered the gold standard in their field.  Now, which ever way the wind blows is how they decide which and what guideline to  follow and when.

The top priority for testing should be for those who show any of the many symptoms of CoV-2 or are exposed to  confirmed positive case/s. Getting timely test results is like pulling teeth especially if the test results are negative. Testing is far more complex to understand if one is not savvy or knowledgeable about basics of viral diagnosis. 

I dreaded being quarantined and when I planned travel half way across the world, I did not want to spend the limited days after reaching my destination, locked up for a week or two. Luckily the world is coming to its senses. I was relived when I found out that if I get tested and the test is negative if done within 96 hours of reaching my destination than no quarantine. The question then was who will provide test results within 24 hours after providing a nasal swab so that a 48 hour journey following the test will be without any problem. Luckily in Louisville there is a diagnostic lab BioTap in downtown Louisville, KY run by a former doctoral student I mentored and the results were back in less than 6 hours. 

Being tested 4 times within the past 4 months, I am quite satisfied that I could be tested on demand without any symptoms or suspicion of exposure. But then I am very proactive about my health as we all should be. I rely on CDC for immunization schedule and prevalence of disease."

There is no price on these things. To see this country-and the world-lied to, its' citizens thrown under the bus like excess baggage, its' agencies excised and refilled with untruths and propaganda makes me sick.

The very people who are the heart of the engine that runs our economies, the laborers, domestic workers, wage workers, front line workers, have been blatantly disregarded during this pandemic. They matter. For us to have a healthy society, they have to count. And for us to function as a healthy society, we need the truth, not illusions."

We still have problems getting the tests, facilities and personnel needed to test the numbers of persons sufficient to curtail this pandemic.

We still have problems setting up the infrastructure to get test results to the patients in time for them to quarantine.

And we don't have the extensive contract tracing and mobile phone apps to inform those who have been exposed to covid cases. So how would all those exposed to a case know to get tested?

So I'm not impressed that CDC has now been able to change one small handicap to controlling the virus. There are many more road blocks to pandemic control they need to remove."
2020-09-18 18:54,"For all of those people wringing their hands over how Joe Biden is campaigning, I suggest you consider a few simple ideas:

1. We have three debates coming up, the first on September 29.  Let's see how Biden handles himself at that one before we panic.

2. Trump continues to say and do things that repel voters, other than the members of his personality cult.

3. Even losers by a landslide have typically received about 40% of the popular vote.  Here is the data:
1932 - Hoover 39.7%  (won 6 states)
1936 - Landon 36.5%  (won 2 states)
1956 - Stevenson 42.0%  (won 7 states)
1964 - Goldwater 38.5%  (won 6 states)
1972 - McGovern 37.5%  (won 1 state + DC)
1984 - Mondale 40.6%  (won 1 state + DC)
1992 - Bush 41 37.4%  (won 16 states) ( 3rd party Perot 18.9% won 0 states) 
1996 - Dole 40.7%  (won 19 states)

Biden is doing his campaigning.

Bloomberg says he will spend $100 million advertising for Biden and against Trump in Florida.  If Trump loses Florida and its 29 EC votes, he is unlikely to win the election.

Just keep working, and MAKE SURE YOU VOTE.

I am rooting for Cadet Bone Spurs to get less popular vote than did Alf Landon in 1936.  That would go a long way toward making America a democracy (and great, as if it ever was) again."

2020-09-18 19:09,"""A shipment of some 20,400 counterfeit N95 respirator masks was intercepted by U.S. Customs and Border Protection agents""

They should release these.  So what if they don't work - no other masks work either.  

Masks have been rigorously tested with RCTs and meta analyses and not one study has found any of the masks protect you from this tiny aerosolized Virus.  

That should be obvious because all the masks breathe in and out from the top, bottom, and sides.  Consider that the researchers in BSL4 labs do not wear these masks, instead they choose to working with unwieldy negative pressure containment fields.  Could they know something the passionate mask-everyone-now people do not?

The only benefit mask research has found is they make people feel better while providing a false sense of security.  So they're good for that and that's all most people want.

Both CDC and WHO rigorously tested masks and found they did nothing at all, but they reversed their original negative guidance for the stated reason: ""masks - useless though they are - make people feel better."" 

I've read that only 26% of people know how to properly fit and wear an N95 mask.  (Not that it matters)

But here's my suggestion; You need to super-glue it in place.  After that you need to not touch it, and cycle, wash, and sterilize it every day.  That should really give you a false sense of security."

I mean an honest, qualified, decent investigator who can look the American people in the eye with the facts and not lie. 
Of course, Trump is at the bottom of this sink hole but just how did we get here? 
Security sources reported that our government was notified of a contagion in China in November 2019. What did the CDC know and when did they know it?

All were telling the White House in February that it (the pandemic) would not be a serious thing here. They were all wrong.  The President believed the scientists and, avoiding panic, did downplay the virulence of corona. The president nevertheless instituted a ban on travel from China in January and on Europe in February and began Operation Warp Speed which is producing a vaccine in record time and produced ventilators which left no one without a ventilator. To say the President is responsible for 180,000 deaths is a blood libel and I have no doubt it will be accepted by Trump haters, deaths in Germany and elsewhere notwithstanding. His record on the coronavirus is as good as can be expected given the advice he received and the actions he took."

On Covid-19 the CDC has lost Reputation within its professional peer group as well as with the public, this at the hands of an attack by the White House.  Any public safety information relevant to CDC Covid-19 critical mission data is now damaged goods and should be treated as such. 

In my humble opinion key public safety information related to Covid-19 coming from the CDC needs to be set aside in favor of expert, peer-reviewed data coming from the likes of Johns-Hopkins, Harvard, et al. 

Until the hostile internal attack on the CDC by the White House is resolved the CDC’s reputation on Covid-19 is shattered.

Twenty years from now when the history is written about this crisis, it will be the exact example of all the things not to do during a global pandemic.

Oh but you can bet they’ll manage to pass a bill to help out the airlines & other greedy corporations with our money.

Singapore, a nation state of six million lost just 30 souls this year to COVID.  CDC sourced and distributed millions of flawed and faulty tests. These tests were prone to false negatives, the worst possible scenario. The CDC praised their Chinese communist colleagues early on; now we know the Chinese hid the ball and permitted international flights to continue. Particularly the daily flights between Wuhan and Milan from whence the most virulent strains reached the US. The CDC advised strongly against masks. They had one job.

There is no teleprompter in the Situation Room. No question will be permitted asking him why he voted for the Iraq war, why he opposed the raid that killed OBL, why he believes in science but is questioning vaccines that cannot be released unless developed by scientists and approved by scientists or why Obama told him not to run in 2016 or 2020 and why, again, he will not submit to a mental status test to judge his cognition.

Including ones with furin cleavage sites which is what makes SARSCov 2 so dangerous for humans. Whether the sites arose through propagation in mice, or whether deliberate manipulations resulted in this site, we now have potential access to such mutants in laboratories here in the US. Disregarding the useless sensationalism of the young Chinese scientist who seems eager to cause more fear and panic, this might be a very good situation. Surely, if these SARS cov 2 like versions are available, we have hope to think scientists might be working to uncover their Achilles heel.

The only thing that will restore public confidence in the CDC et. al. will be a change in Administration.  Whether that comes on 01/20/21 or 01/20/25 is the only remaining question.

The simple reality is that often we'll never know if we've been in close contact with someone who has Covid and thus exposed us.  Getting a test shouldn't be based on such constructive knowledge.  We should be able to get tested regularly whenever we have legitimate but unknown concerns.

I divide my time b/w NY and LA.  I'm presently in CA and so glad it's been removed from NYS's quarantine list.  It means I won't have to quarantine when I return home to NY in a couple of weeks.

“Next the scientists determined that antibody’s genetic sequence and inserted DNA with that sequence into hamster ovary cells, turning them into tiny antibody factories. The bacteria were grown in huge stainless steel vats under aseptic conditions in a sterile room; the bacterial soup must be constantly monitored to ensure that it has not been contaminated by other microbes.

Once the vat is teeming with bacteria and brimming with antibodies, workers remove the soup and concentrate the antibodies for use as a drug.”

If the antibodies are being produced in hamster ovary cells, then there should be no bacteria involved, either in the vats or in the soup, unless there were contamination. Note that some recombinant protein types can be produced in bacteria, but I believe that is not the case here due to the wording on the first sentence in this quote."

1. It increases the likelihood that there is a vaccine.
2. It provides a therapy for less than critically ill patients. It therefore raises the potential that, if used appropriately, it will reduce hospitalizations, offloading critical ICU rooms, ventilators and frontline medical staff.

But... as new cases are currently rising, especially in the midwest, it is still critically important to minimize new cases of COVID because this therapy, since it is so difficult to produce, will be in short supply for the foreseeable future. Every additional new case will consume precious amounts of the few therapies we have. Any shortages will mean additional serious illness and inevitably death.

The way it is currently phrased makes it sounds like COVID-19 has killed more people than those other viruses or illnesses, since they began, which is untrue.

In other words, COVID-19 has not killed more people than malaria or HIV, but has only killed more people than malaria or HIV have in the year 2020, or over the past year, or whatever time frame is being used (which is unclear). Without this qualification, simply stating that COVID-19 has killed more people than HIV or malaria, full stop, makes it sound like it has killed more people than those diseases ever have.

It does though have one of the highest populations of above 55, compared to India which boasts of a high percent of younger population. Add to our aging population vulnerable to CoV-2, the percent of over weight, diabetic and immunodeficient population is high too, we have a lot of lessons to learn to survive viral pandemics and be healthier. Our coastal cities are some of the most traveled to, cities in the world and trans Atlantic and trans Pacific flights from across oceans were the major carriers of the CoV-2. Days before outbreak in NY, there were according to Dr. Rand Paul, senator from KY some 125,000+ travelers from Italy, which later became the epicenter of Europe. One valuable lesson we did not learn from the Chinese experience following 2003 CoV-2 out break was to screen incoming travelers whether by air, land or sea for temperature (temp) elevation. I landed in China in 2004 and I was not checked for weapons or explosives or scanned inside my underwear, but they checked my temp and my passport. Every time I went subsequently my temp was checked.

Choosing the wrong one based on insufficient, preliminary data could have literally fatal consequences - and also waste billions of dollars.

To just review the timeline described: The trial started end of July. Even with the accelerated schedule, the earliest a ""case"", i.e., a Covid19 infection causing symptoms, can be counted is  beginning of September. 
How rapidly did they manage to enroll? AstraZeneca was about half way to the enrollment goal when they shut down temporarily a few weeks ago.
It likely took Pfizer a few weeks to get sizable numbers going - so most are only now even becoming eligible to count as cases.
And the 32 cases are only going to mean anything if the distribution between trial group is extremely lopsided, which is unlikely since the vaccine is designed to only achieve a 50% reduction in cases. Anything else will require much larger numbers of cases to reach significance, or indeed miss the goal entirely."

And a vaccine before the end of 2020 will not have been tested for a long enough time, no matter what Trump says, to say that it will be as effective as it should be. Benefits of a possible safe and effective vaccine must be weighed against the possibility of lower than predicted effectiveness or as yet undiscovered danger, like enhancement of virus susceptibility or virulence for certain populations as yet untested.

just a few days ago,j ohnson & johnson, which also has a vaccine in phase 3 trials, said it could have results at the end of the year.

 pfizer's vaccine is a messenger RNA (mRNA) type and it is a new approach compared to traditional attenuated virus vaccines.  mRNA vaccines trick the body into making antibodies.

virus vector vaccines use another type of virus to get into cells, drop off a gene that can't reproduce and inactivates covid-19.

i don't trust trump to tell the truth - i want the trials completed and get advice from my own doctor - an infectious disease expert who once worked for dr. fauci - to tell me it's ok to get vaccinated and which vaccine to use. i am fine social distancing and staying home until then. it has already been about 7 months - what's a few more months to have an approved safety determination rather than risk the possibility of as-yet unknown side effects?

Operation warp speed will likely  turn out to be one of the largest waste of funds ever authorized by any government given how it has been managed by individuals with only very short term political agendas and motivations. Pfizer's CEO embarrasses himself, his company, the integrity of the vaccine creation process, medicine, and science by pandering to Trump.

Others were lured by the gov'ts Covid-19 money. Pfizer sees the disease as a way to restore its industry primacy. Others avoid politics. Machiavellian Pfizer wants to engage in politics, because that's where power lies.

In 2014 Pfizer tried to negotiate buying AstraZeneca. When that didn't happen, they tried a hostile take-over. It's about politics, baby. Pfizer wanted the effort to fuel stock rise: buying AZ would lower taxes. But the 2014 US Treasury blocked its proposed tax inversion, damping the fizzle, and dousing the take-over.

Big institutional investors - Black Rock, Vanguard - own 70% of shares. Virtual silent partners, they demand more. Bourla’s public antics are aimed at them, as much as the Trump administration. He'll get in the mud pit, because he knows where the power is.

To clarify, she thinks they may have a good impression of how well the vaccine works on October.  HOWEVER, safety is much harder to prove than efficacy, so she's really not claiming it will be ready for approval for the general population."

Keep in mind that they have a lot of incentive to push the vaccine early, and legal protection if at some point it is shown to have unexpected side effects or toxicities.  
If trumps ""October surprise"" is a vaccine before Nov 3rd, it is a hollow promise. And even I might refuse to take the vaccine."

The triumph, if and when it arrives, will be that of the scientists that Trump is so eager to discount and disparage when the facts don't comport with his re-election goals. Don't let this be spun into some great achievement by Trump, whose only goal is to save himself."

As a biochemist, two months seems to me to be a very reasonable amount of time for any immune-related side effects to present.  And vaccines as a class are one of the safest medical interventions we have.  Of course we will have to wait and see what the data show, but if side effects are no worse than fever and injection site soreness, you have the risk to benefit determination skewed by not taking this during a pandemic.  As much as Trump is trying to take credit for this, I truly don't believe things would be progressing any slower under, say, a president Obama, and I don't think people would be pushing back as much at these timelines.  Of course, Trump should keep his mouth closed and not try to make this about him, but I think the idea that he can force government scientists to approve something that is not ready is much overstated.  Let's not give him any more credit or prejudge the outcome just yet."

Sort of like coffeehousing other poker players with an announcement that they will have all the cards, to drive others to fold early. It is also partly to curry favor with the White House, and to reduce bothersome regulatory oversight of safety and effectiveness determinations.

In a world of informed consumers of health care, I can easily find out who makes my drugs, and specify if I wish whose drugs I will not use. The upshot here is that I will decline this COVID vaccine and any other Pfizer product, now and forever, period. The gamble Pfizer is taking is that the no-maskers and hoax theorists, Trumpistas all, will decide in sufficient numbers that it isn’t a hoax after all, and go for the vaccine. But of course, why would they. I think that, ultimately, Pfizer will be stuck with a bunch of vaccine that smart folk won’t use because they don’t trust the Pfizer/Trump connection, and the rubes won’t use because they have been convinced it isn’t necessary. Doesn’t Pfizer have a board that is smart enough to see this for the disaster that it may become?"
2020-09-30 18:13,"We have never cured any disease, not even the common cold - most certainly not the flu (of which Covid is a variety)."
2020-09-30 18:02,"""Around 15 percent of vaccines in late-stage trials do not make it to approval."" Read the reference - it says 15% DO make it to approval."
2020-09-30 18:42,"It is unlikely.  The need for emergency procedures in vetting vaccines was recognized decades ago.  The emergency procedures for Covid-19 were established months ago.  Everything was fine, but only until it looked like a vaccine might be available before the election.  Then people complained about safety.  It's not safety, it's politics.  Politics that are more important than people's lives to those playing the game."
2020-09-30 19:14,"Prediction:  The reality is that, best case scenario, the coronavirus vaccine will be similar to the flu vaccine.  It will be between 50-70% effective, and maybe 50-60% of the country will be willing to take it (unless it is mandated by schools and workplaces).  This will prevent outbreaks that necessitate lockdowns and social distancing, and allow us to mostly return to normalcy, but the coronavirus will always be lurking just like influenza, with limited community transmission every winter and spring.  People will still have a chance to catch it, whether they get the shot or not.  So for those ""I'm not doing anything until a vaccine comes and I'm petrified about long-term symptoms"" people, they will be wearing masks and isolating themselves for years to come.  There will be some people who will be too afraid to send their kids to school even 5 years from now, even though the mortality risk to young children is no worse than influenza.  It is going to take maybe a decade to undo the panic, misinformation, and sensationalism perpetuated by the liberal media whose primary goal has been to make Covid as big and bad as possible in people's minds in order to unseat Trump.  Maybe this gambit will be worth it if Trump is truly as bad for the country as some think he is.  But those people who cannot escape this trance post-vaccine will have their quality of life degraded over time (refusal to attend weddings, attend in-person school, travel, eat indoors, etc)."
2020-09-30 20:34,I worked for Pfizer for over a decade. I don't trust them at all. This is a completely marketing-driven company.
2020-09-30 20:12,"All Trump had to do was follow the NSC Playbook that was developed under Obama.  (Wonder why Biden didn't bring THAT up last night!).  But that was an Obama product, so he destroyed it, just like he's trying to destroy the ACA.

That playbook should have been followed early on, and coordinated with the efforts of many other countries.

Now, with the current pandemic mess, nobody I know is going to jump on the bandwagon and sign up for an early vaccination.  We'll wait for the full trials and analyses as conducted by real scientists, thank you.  Fauci said last week that he didn't expect any semblance of normality until the end of next year, with a lot of ""ifs"" preceding that statement!

Hang on, hunker down, ask for help if you need it (because it is not coming from Republicans), and ride it out as best you can."

2020-09-30 21:41,Why are you rooting for a late vaccine? Neither Trump nor Biden can do anything about it. If it works - use it -  whenever. Your creepy dislike of anything Trump is not helpful. Sometimes he is overly optimistic. Why do you root for pessimism? You live in a very dark world.
2020-09-30 23:26,"Wait.  This is America.

If Pfizer announces a vaccine too early and turns out to be a hoax - the lawyers will rush to the courts so fast as to create a traffic jam. 

Pfizer could even go bankruot.

So, I expect their lawyers are playing a decisive role in these discussions.

But this race to a vaccine - is a good thing.

Drs Crick and Watson with their Double Helix come to mind about this race to announce a discovery.  

When they realized a rival chemist was about to make an announcement, they rushed theirs forward.

And I have said this before - when POTUS announces a successful vaccine -  Biden protesting - the Dow Jones will race past 30,000 to make your head spin."
2020-09-30 23:58,"I can understand how companies can show efficacy pretty quickly. 

I don’t know how they can show safety.  For instance, how many women will be vaccinated, get pregnant, and give birth during the trial period?  If none, how will we know if a vaccine causes an increase in birth defects?  (A more minor issue: how will we know how long the vaccine works?)

So, my guess is that the contracts that trump signed with the drug companies must give those companies liability protection."

2020-10-01 1:42,One aspect not mentioned is which companies are stockpiling the vaccine before we know the result. If Pfizer is already sitting on 50 million doses they could move quickly if provisionally approved. The same is true for Moderna and AstraZeneca.

2020-09-30 18:01,"""He also said that the group’s other recommendations, such as allowing fewer passengers, enforcing mask wearing and installing improved air filtration systems, aim to limit the spread of the virus on a ship should an infected passenger board.""

""Recommendations"" are gratifying, but lack teeth. The CDC's only tooth is the no-sail order. Who polices the cruise lines to be sure they have upgraded their HVAC and will ensure passengers wear masks? 

I speak as someone who loves cruising, and had two cruises canceled this year. Still, I am not confident about returning to the sea, if only mere ""recommendations"" are in play."

2020-09-30 18:21,Anyone who chooses to take the risk and sail in the midst of a pandemic should be required to sign a waiver of liability. If there is an outbreak of COVID on their ship they will be required to sit out at sea for 14 days and quarantine. Are some people so desperate to travel on a cruise ship during a pandemic??

2020-09-30 18:32,"Mandatory c19 tests before boarding for each passenger, no exceptions, is a good start.   Masks and  social distancing aboard the ships will be difficult to enforce.

We don't care who relieves what restructions: you couldn't get us on a cruise liner if you paid for the entire voyage.  We've stayed home since early March, and we're not going anywhere before next summer, at best.  Even then, the thought of doing anything social with a lot of people in a confined space---airplane, bus, train, or ship--is not on the list, perhaps forever.  We're grateful for the trips we've been able to make, and that's enough."
2020-09-30 18:40,"It does appear that Redfield has decided to challenge
his bosses publicly and frontally when deemed appropriate.  

The conclusion will be inevitable even if politically damaging.  

Presumably, Redfield believes that he is in a stronger position since his firing would not go down well with the public that is still capable of paying attention. So he's playing tough and looking for effective payback given the recent incursions on CDC's turf by political appointees in HHS or WH who insist upon interfering with CDC recommendations.

But belief in such institutional insularity and strength  is contingent upon his position being within a normally functioning democratic government. 

Anyone paying the slightest attention surely must realize that this is surely not what we are living in at present. 

So, it is also just as  likely that Redfield will soon be joining the ranks of former government employees, leaving behind

Who I feel terrible for are the inhabitants of the Caribbean islands where these ships dock. They inevitably lack the resources to deal with the effects of the diseased Americans who will now come to their shores."
2020-09-30 18:01,"Gee what could go wrong??!! 

 Do you suppose we could send the Florida governor and the US President (and family) on such a cruise.  SOON?!  

Might solve a lot of problems  if the GOP picks Pence as the presidential candidate and Florida gets to elect a new governor.   

Otherwise, people who take these cruises deserve what they catch (and may not be able to get medical care for in any timely way)."
2020-09-30 18:08,How nice the US government will allow cruise ships to set sail empty.  I doubt they will be able to get many people to volunteer for confinement on floating petri dishes.
2020-09-30 18:17,"You’d have to be nuts to take a cruise right now. In the best of times there are outbreaks of norovirus, but who would want to risk getting such a deadly disease like Covid. Also why do these potential passengers think they would be able to even disembark anywhere. Americans aren’t welcome to fly into most country. Why do they think countries would welcome us from a cruise ship, a virtual incubator of germs. Don’t people remember what happen to the ship in Japan, where passengers were stranded in the harbor for at least 2 weeks, since authorities wouldn’t let them get off the ship. Meanwhile more and more got infected. Trump himself wouldn’t let a ship with mostly American passengers dock in San Francisco in March, because a few passengers were sick and Trump didn’t want to “ruin his numbers.” He’d do the same thing to any new passengers.

What a joke that Trump’s cronies said the passengers would wear masks and practice social distancing when one of them do any of that while on land. The ship when it set sail would really be A “ship of fools.l"

Dr. Redfield, if you cared more about the American people, whom you are supposed to protect, and less about keeping your job, you'd resign.

2020-09-30 18:18,"It seems Trump's every action regarding the coronavirus is aimed at allowing it to spread faster.  How could that be, for any sane person?

It only makes sense that it is a way to discourage people from voting in person.  Then he fights to get mail-in votes discarded as invalid, declares voting as old-fashioned and outdated, and himself president (king) by fiat.  At least a crown would cover up that hair."
2020-09-30 18:12,"To appeal to Florida swing state voters, Trump wants to make their shorelines the destination of choice for thousands of infected virus vectors just like the Diamond Princess passengers and crew.

I didn't realize the suicidal demographic was considered an important one to court in Florida. Trump knows the senior citizens along the southern coast are the people with the most to lose from this proposition, yes? 

Meanwhile, thanks to the lack of a competent  national response to suppress the virus and enable a test and trace protocol, Orlando's theme parks are no longer economically viable. Disney's layoffs, long in coming, have made sure another 28,000 people or so have nothing better to do on election day than vote. While Republicans try to minimize their unemployment insurance.

I guess the politically suicidal demographic is running the Trump campaign in Florida. Wow, all of a sudden Brad Parscale's trajectory makes perfect sense."
2020-09-30 18:13,"Clearly, it's time for Dr. Redfield to (finally) take sides--does he serve science and public health and the American people, or does he serve political masters who actively undermine science and endanger Americans' lives over and over?  Stand up to the White House, or resign.  He's trying to play a lose-lose-lose game.  He's tearing apart the CDC and professionalism he presumably cares about by caving in to unhinged White House and HHS political appointees.  He can't please them, regardless of how much he compromises himself.  He's also lost all credibility and his professional reputation.  Remember C.

2020-09-30 18:13,When is Redfield resigning?  And when will he reveal what has really gone on in those meetings?
2020-09-30 18:42,"This is a disaster waiting to happen.  It will be a Petri Dish.  All it takes is one infected crewmember or passenger to start the process.  Why not insist that the ship make no port calls for two days before debarkation in Florida?  That way any infected individuals will be detectable by a rapid COVID test which must be administered to every passenger and crewmember before anyone disembarks.  If someone fails then a quarantine is required for the entire ship until the health department is satisfied that the risk is mitigated.  

I think it’s fine if people want to risk a cruise.  It is not OK to come back and infect innocent citizens.  Then again, they're coming back to a state where everything, including bars and restaurants, is operating at full capacity.  Maybe it doesn't matter."
2020-09-30 18:48,When will the CDC learn to stop making health and safety pronouncements when President Trump will do it for them and make certain his message comes through loud and strong no matter how much laughter it provokes?  The President believes  in his special wisdom no matter how great the risk is to the rest of us.  We need a trusted group outside of the government and the President's direction to give reliable information to us.
2020-09-30 19:09,"My husband and I retired to Florida.  What a mistake.  DeSantis last week fully opened restaurants and bars and since his announcement, there has been a significant decrease in shoppers wearing face masks.  

By opening the ports, the cruise traffic will add a significant layer of danger to the residents of Florida.  This state has a large population of the most vulnerable.  We will soon again lead the nation in Covid cases.  DeSantis, Rubio, and Scott have no concern for the average Floridian."
2020-09-30 19:23,"Sure, put more people at risk in the misguided hope of inspiring a more robust economic reopening when the science predicts and our experience has so far shown the likely outcome to be at the expense of a higher positivity rate, more infections, linger illnesses and death; and in the end without true feeling and being safe we really cannot have a robust economic resurgence that goes beyond the ups and downs of Wall Street.  But this administration persists in undermining the credibility of its experts.  Its own credibility, of course, is and has long been in tatters."

2020-09-30 19:51,"The cruiselines were already planning on not sailing in October so this does not change much for them operationally at least. What is surprising to me is why there would be a no-sail order for cruiselines and not a comparable no-fly order for airlines? I personally do not plan to cruise or fly until there is a vaccine but it is rather surprising frankly.  I agree that the Princess ship in Japan was a debacle but that was when COVID 19 was not on anyone's radar - and we can't know how that is unfolding in planes either - since we have no thorough contact tracing mechanism in place. In any case, even if the order is lifted - the issue is going to be one of demand really."
2020-09-30 19:57,"Newspaper readers were warned long ago about norovirus outbreaks on cruise ships.  Then we read about the Diamond Princess outbreak of the coronavirus, and the scores of ships circling aimlessly with no port willing to let them dock.  I conclude that the only people willing to get back on these plague ships are those who oblivious to all news of their dangers.  Bon voyage."
2020-09-30 19:59,"My thought? Just go for it. If this is how the Trump Administration and Florida Republicans want to handle the pandemic and the reopening of the cruise ship industry, just do it. But be ready to accept the consequences of more outbreaks, although it’s something neither the administration nor Florida Republicans will ultimately do. And to those who take a cruise, be sure to totally understand the risks and read the fine print."

The cruise ships are not built in the United States.  The crews are at least 95 percent non American.  All the ships are registered in foreign countries.  Most cruise lines are owned by foreign entities.  And most all money that cruise lines earn go into foreign banks.

How does the cruise industry help the United States economy?"
2020-09-30 20:02,"I like to go on cruises, but it is 100% guaranteed that I will not even look at itineraries until there is a vaccine and/or infection rates less than 1% for several weeks.  The cruise industry can send their floating petri dishes out to see if they want, but they should expect a very bad outcome."
2020-09-30 20:06,"There's a difference between personal health and public health. Your doctor can urge you to quit smoking, quit eating sugar, get more exercise, or whatever it is that will improve your chances against the disease you have or might acquire -- but it is ultimately up to you, even though your death may grieve those near to you. Public health, on the other hand, pays attention to risks to the public as a whole. Let those who want to go on cruises take their lives in their own hands? As a matter of public health, that's unacceptable -- because those people travel from all over the country to get on board that cruise, and disperse to all over the country when it is over. And, it should go without saying, public health should always be guided by the best scientific and medical information available, and never by politics or special interests."
2020-09-30 20:09,"This is one of the reasons that Governor DeSantis has been so busy pandering to Trump. Although I don't see how Florida makes that much money from cruise ship passengers. They sometimes spend a night before their cruise in a hotel or maybe the ship stops in Key West. But the cruise companies make all the money, and they are not even registered in the US. 
We have the best infectious disease doctors in the world and we are not even listening to them."
2020-09-30 20:11,Good luck with that. Cruise ships were a Petrie dish way before Covid happened. I wouldn’t take a cruise if it was free.
2020-09-30 18:45,"The key to opening up, whether it's cruise ships or bars and nightclubs, is getting the pandemic under control. DeSantis is a bigger threat to the tourism industry in Florida than federal regulations. 

 An immediate issue is what happens to the passengers when a ship is at sea for a few days and a passenger tests positive. Do they get quarantined on their ""floating petri dish?"" That prospect would sure deter me from cruising. 

There were a number of instances of diseases breaking out on cruise ships before COVID-19 came along. It's not enough to get ships sailing. They have to be carrying enough passengers that it makes economic sense to put out to sea rather than to park them and wait out the pandemic. Rebuilding passenger confidence is going to be a heck of a job."
2020-09-30 19:03,"Potential votes trump health and life. 

The Vice-President and Mrs Pence can demonstrate leadership and go on the first cruise, without the special protections against Covid-19 that they receive because of his office, and interact extensively with crew and passengers.   If one or both contract Covid-19, that's progress toward herd immunity.   Come to think about it, the more crew and passengers that contract Civid-19, the more progress there is toward herd immunity."

Redfield might exert far more influence on the nation's health by speaking out than being shut out."
2020-09-30 19:54,"Two things - is everybody now off the ships that were quarantined? I hear no because no country would take them.
Second, the cruise ships should add a guaranteed $500,000 compensation package to anyone who contracts Covid while cruising."
2020-09-30 20:07,"My wife and I have really enjoyed cruising, but there is absolutely NO WAY we are going on a cruise until 2022 (most likely 2023 or never.)  You'd have to be nuts to go on a cruise this year or early next year.  I predict if that happens we'll be reading all about a re-visit of the Diamond Princess mess.  Will Florida be happy to welcome back returning cruise ships with infected passengers and crew on board?
No thanks to cruising.  We'll miss it, but at least we did get to go on a few B4 the whole cruise industry circled the drain."
2020-09-30 19:15,"Even a small, bare-bones cruise ship sailing the remote Norwegian fjords this summer had a C-19 outbreak.  Norway has done an exemplary job in containing the virus.  If Norwegians couldn’t manage to keep cruises safe, then in no way do I trust the floating casinos to do so."
2020-09-30 19:24,"""Republican politicians in Florida and cruise industry lobbyists have called for ending the no-sail order.""

Well, there you have it -- lobbyists and politicians from FL writing the CDC guidelines for allowing cruise ships to sail again.
Of course it will be quite funny if various ports in other countries decide to not allow passenger ships from the US to dock because they don't want the virus to spread to their population."
2020-09-30 19:30,"The undermining of the CDC has got to stop. Republicans leaders (Grassley, Alexander, Bush, etc) must speak out to protect our institutions’ reputation and credibility. Otherwise we devolve into the Wild West.

Having taken lots of cruises (we get an in-state discount; I could ride my bike to the port), you won’t catch me sailing on one of the incubators. Hallways too narrow, stairways too crowded, passengers too selfish to follow rules. 

We’ll miss the revenue, but not the further extension of the lockdown restrictions."
2020-09-30 19:39,"What this Administration does not understand is that ordering (or allowing) businesses to open is secondary to controlling the virus and restoring confidence.  If customers do not believe a business is safe, it really doesn't matter what the Administration does.  Stunts like this only reinforce the perception that the responsible government agencies are being controlled/corrupted by craven politicians."
2020-09-30 19:43,"Just because you allow cruises to sail doesn’t mean customers will hurry to get on board. See what happened to Disney yesterday being forced to layoff a substantial part of their workforce because people still weren’t coming in droves to Orlando.

So unless one has been living under a rock and didn’t hear about the horrific cruise infections, lack of health measures for both staff and passengers, refusal by various countries, inc the US, for infected ships to dock, the last place you want to be is on a cruise ship.

But hey, since there are still people who believe in the Donald, refuse to wear masks. think it’s a hoax or they’re now immune, I suppose there may be a few fools willing to shell out money to risk their lives."
2020-09-30 19:50,"It sounds to me like Dr. Redfield better update his resume.
And the cruise industry is going to be in the same pickle as the airlines.  That would be closing operations probably after the first cruises."
2020-09-30 19:51,"The government is out of control with nobody at the helm. This is surreal and, frankly, scary that Trump can do this by fiat."
2020-09-30 20:10,"I will be first in line for a cruise. I have 5 booked in the next 6 months and have plans on booking 2 more. A cruise will be the safest place to be. I love to hear ALL of you say you won't cruise because the less people on the ship, the better. Hope my November cruise is a go !!!"
2020-09-30 18:27,I enjoy cruising but now is not the time to restart.
2020-09-30 18:29,Another reason you can't trust the cdc and the GOP. Money before health. Cruise if you want but stay out of NY.
2020-09-30 19:31,"Cruise ships are floating pestilences. They are heavy contributors to climate change pollutants and are poison to the health of every living organism at sea which are the primary source of oxygen to our planet along with our forests.

It is a crime to allow these toxic floating hotels to pollute our seas.   This industry should not exist."
2020-09-30 19:56,"You'd have to have a ""death wish"" to leave on a cruise from a florida port any time before we have a safe and effective vaccine with a majority of the population accepting a vaccine.  And where will cruise ships from the US be allowed to dock?  Probably only the Carribbean and some South American countries where the virus continues to rage."
2020-09-30 20:11,"The cruise industry does not pay taxes to the US and this should be ended immediately if Biden wins. 
They also do not fully investigate their workers health and past criminal records. Women who are raped on cruises are not protected by US law. The cruise industry launders money through their casinos which are not properly regulated. The cruise industry should be ended the way it is set up."
2020-09-30 18:29,Is there a fund I can contribute to that will encourage Trump supporters to take cruises by helping to subsidize their tickets?
2020-09-30 18:36,"Oh gosh, I can't think of anything more enjoyable than spending a week (or more, maybe MUCH more if there's a virus breakout) on a tightly packed ship, passing each other in the narrow passageways, singing drunken karaoke together, eating and drinking together (no masks worn in the dining areas, because you can't eat and drink with a mask on), exercise classes together, sharing teensy pools with kids screaming ""Marco Polo"" every three seconds, and let's not forget the shore excursions cheek-by-jowl on buses! 

Of course, passengers can take extra precautions and drink a little bleach or Lysol before boarding, and they'll be fully protected! 

Cruise ships were, and still are, floating virus factories. Shutting them down until late 2021 is what would have been appropriate."
2020-09-30 19:04,"Gosh, is it possible that cruise ships are perfect petri dishes for spreading Covid-19? How can CDC say such a thing? Aren't they as safe as aircraft carriers?

I mean, has there been a single outbreak on one since, June? They can't make a profit at 1/3 full, so just fill 'em up and let 'em sail. Let the passengers wander through all those ports and then come right back to the good old USA! No risk there. Remember, mask and distancing rules do not apply past 12 miles off-shore, so have fun at dinner, the discos, and the casinos. 

And we'll have fun, fun, fun hoping magic keeps the covid away."
2020-09-30 19:05,"“It's going to disappear. One day, it's like a miracle, it will disappear.”

2020-09-30 19:11,"Trump is missing out on an important fact. Just because you open the economy, schools, and now cruise ships doesn' mean everyone's going to feel safe coming back. 

What will he do when there are countries that won't allow a curise ship to dock? Declare war?"
2020-09-30 19:22,"Let them go on a cruise, as long as anybody coming back to shore stays for 14 days locked in a hotel (not of his choice) and pays for food and lodging. This is how people can travel to Australia or Malaysia these days. Compulsory quarantine upon arrival."
2020-09-30 19:48,"By refusing to do an actual national lockdown, the USA has turned itself into a Covid incubator, constantly feeding the virus new hosts so it can reproduce.
The more virus we make, the more opportunities it has to mutate into more deadly or more easily transmitted forms.

More virus and more strains of the virus is not the way to reopen the economy.

Trump said nine months ago that we would go from fifteen cases to zero, even though he know full well he was lying.

If the USA doesn't get serious about controlling Covid this will get worse before it gets better. Ideal is now in a second lock down.

Trump supporters are putting Altoona lives at risk, because they would rather repeat lies in support of their anti-constitutional president than actually save the USA from danger."
2020-09-30 20:05,But of course it comes down to Florida. I hope to god that Bloomberg's money can flip the state blue. It's the only good thing he will have done since he ruined New York City.
2020-09-30 18:50,"We are cruisers but concerned  about cruising during the pandemic.  We got a promotional brochure for Holland America cruises offering terrific discounts on Caribbean cruises this winter and spring, so we called for details, ready to book if we could get a March or April cruise with assurances we could cancel if the virus was still a problem.  Our consultant told us in so many words that the discounts weren't worth the health risk and we would have to pre-pay everything upfront for the discounts.  Clearly the cruise lines are hurting and need some cash now.  We didn't schedule and were thankful that the consultant was honest about the risks."
2020-09-30 19:31,"The White House says forcing the CDC to allow ships to sail is not a political act, please no one believes that!  Trump is even or behind Vice President Biden and he is desperate to win there his ""home state"", its all political.  Shame on Rubio and Scott they are listening to a man who has no respect for his experts or the science and show the same disrespect for their constituency that the president does.  At some point down the line there will be deaths on the cruise ships and the finger should point directly at Scott and Rubio for siding with the president and not the citizens of Florida."
2020-09-30 19:32,Dr. Redfield seems more interested in keeping his job than doing his job.
2020-09-30 19:32,"Not shocked at all. The cruise lines have put off officially until end of October but many ships are not scheduled to launch until next April as it is.

Trump knows his base though. Don't get in between them and an all you can eat buffet."
2020-09-30 20:00,"It's obvious people are going to die from this decision, because cruise ships have always been petri dishes for diseases, such as Norwalk, another virus. Can you imagine being trapped with 4,000 other people aboard a ship, and told when you can leave? When I visit relatives in Miami Beach, we can see the cruise ship customers, people from all over the country, milling around downtown with their backpacks, doing last-minute shopping before boarding these monstrous ships. Governor ""Mini-Me"" DeSantis and his (hoped for) future boss Trump will do anything to make the country appear normal, just before election day. They do. not. care. about new casualties from the pandemic."
2020-09-30 20:23,"My husband and I were very frequent cruisers, very frequent.  We are in our late 80's and really miss cruising, not only the cruise, but the planning and excitement of figuring out where we want to go next or just stay on the ship and cruise.    
However, at this time we will not plan for or go on a cruise until we are absolutely sure of their safety.  We will wait until there is a safe vaccine and then reconsider.  
Meanwhile I wish good health and safety to all the crew member who always took good care of us."
2020-09-30 20:28,"Who is going to be foolish enough to book a trip on a cruise ship.  Cruise ships have already been proven to be incubators for Covid-19. In the unlikely event that every single asymptomatic passenger did not have Covid-19 and the ship was completely safe when it first sailed, what about the first stop when tourists disembark.  Will none of them come into contact with a Covid carrier while ashore.  Repeat this by the number of spots the ship is expected to make and the reality of the danger becomes apparent. And when the ship does return with several cases on board, will Trump allow them to disembark? He didn't last time."
2020-09-30 20:41,"To do cruise ships safely they have to (rapid) test crew and passengers, just before they enter isolation for 2 weeks in individual (land based) cabins (preferably on an island).  Do another rapid test before they can board the ship.  Then you can sail them around, but NOT allow them to get off the ship at any place.  Finally after whatever number of days at sea, they can be allowed to get back to land."
2020-09-30 20:41,"The Governor of Florida did not call his state to be God's Waiting Room in jest. Working with the DeSantis in the White House, he is making sure that it is so in every possible way.

They all are quite deadly serious with this reopening thing, without paying a fraction of the attention needed  to actually mitigate the virus. Have a plan to control the virus, control it, and it would naturally lead to freer movement of people and the reopening of businesses."
2020-09-30 20:43,"Aside from being cosmically dangerous to overrule the scientists, it's also fairly pointless because no countries are willing to accept the ships in their ports, especially from the country that account for 20% of the cases but only 4% of the population."
2020-09-30 20:52,"The cruise lines are incorporated overseas, which means that these cruise companies pay little to no taxes in the US. But it is the US that will be left to pick up the healthcare bill for everyone who gets COVID-19. So US taxpayers will be on the hook for Trump's cronies once again.

Oh, but that's OK for a President who thinks it's OK for him and his friends to avoid taxes."
2020-09-30 20:53,I'm not really concerned with the CDC says because no one that I know of is getting on a cruise ship in the next 6 months. furthermore who wants to say a lot of Miami. so the cruise ships will go round trip from Miami into the Caribbean without being able to stop at any of the islands sounds like a great trip to me. and then the people come back to Miami and hopefully the states are from will quarantine them upon arrival for 14 days. or in best case because they're on the water for six to eight days anybody that comes down with a virus requires a ship to be quarantined and everybody tested and those that are negative can get off the ship and those that are positive gets down the ship for an indefinite period of time at the expense of the cruise line. Good luck
2020-09-30 21:10,"A reputation-saving resignation from Redfield should have occurred months ago when Trump was blathering about miracle cures and resisting mask wearing, social distancing, increased testing, quarantine and contact tracing. Both he and Dr. Fauci were too meek when it mattered most. Their eventual contradictions of Trump should have occurred earlier and with more urgency given their influential positions."
2020-09-30 19:04,"A POTUS, no matter how ignorant, no matter how corrupt, no matter how misguided, yields an incredible amount of power. In this case, all of it is being used for evil and WE, the people, will continue to go down the toilet with each of trump’s flushes!

Every government worker should take heed because this POTUS will find a way to unlawfully and erroneously wield his corruption and ignorance in your lane one day. You will be surprised how far his reach has gone in 4 years.

But, regarding the cruise industry ... it is just another example of trump’s use of power to manipulate truth for his own purposes. 

And, the seniors that will surely buy their tickets, will — predictably — be the first to squeak and take no responsibility for their foolishness when people start getting sick and no country comes to their rescue.

And, other private sector businesses,  like the cruise industry, will make excuses for their misjudgment in valuing the almighty dollar over human life. 

But, in trump’s GREAT America, humans are sacrificial lambs to slaughter."
2020-09-30 19:37,"At this point in time who, exactly, would want to join the line in a cruise ship salad bar? Cough, cough, it's all you can eat! Hard-boiled eggs and chicken wings well picked over by hundreds? Next up, Karaoke sing alongs and table tennis? No thank you."
2020-09-30 20:20,Not a surprise: Trump has been lying and gaslighting about the pandemic from the start – and he doesn't care how many people die so long as he winds reelection.
2020-09-30 18:28,"The CDC ought to publish every COVID recommendation with the following statement: “This is what we recommend, this is what the Trump Administration wants us to recommend. You choose, but follow Trump’s recommendations at your own peril.”"
2020-09-30 19:10,"This is starting to feel like worse than Total Incompetence and deep into Deliberate Action to make Covid worse on the part of Donald Trump. 

It's not even in his Political Self Interest to bungle this so badly and do everything he can to make matters worse.

Starting to wonder if the people who hold those massive debts coming due over his head are exerting leverage to make Covid as terrible as possible in America. 

Smells like Russia to me via Duesche Bank."
2020-09-30 18:35,Why would anyone risk being stranded and isolated on a ship loaded with Covid cases? Cruises should be banned until a Vaccine or treatment is found. I suppose there will be those who are stupid enough to take the risk.

To assure Floridians that it’s safe to cruise I suggest Mike Pence, Dr. Scott Atlas and Governor DeSantis, their spouses and their extended families board and sail for a fun filled week of cruising.  Thrills galore!

Especially bring along the grandchildren since the “young” according to COVID-19 expert Trump, the “young” don’t get it.  

They can put their actions, advice and alleged knowledge about  about COVID-19 to the test.  The alleged knowledge that has been constantly streaming from their compromised forced misinformation upon the National Health Services.  

Let the accompanying passengers be a plethora of Republican political and Celebrity Covid-19 naysayers.  Film it.  It can be like revisiting an episode of “The Love Boat.”  Kid Rock could be the musical entertainment.

After all, a lot of deaths benefit the funeral industry, the health care industry profits, hospital stocks, etc, and lessen the strain on the American way of life in general?  With a mindset that considers the stock market the total sum of the economy and profit the bottom line of everything Americans can/should want, why continue to support those who cannot contribute to the profits?  After all, they’ve rigged the tax laws to maximize their own intake already.  Seriously, I am serious, this IS the Republican plan.

As to cruise ships. Gross! As to US cruise passengers...some of the worst tourists to travel. When I lived in the Caribbean, the worst days were when the ships shuttled their passengers for their day excursion to the island I lived on. Sun burnt, obnoxious oafs, waddling around the sights, uninformed about the basic history (slave trade) who only wanted burgers and fries and soda, instead of the delicious local fare. Insulting to the local culture, and downright slobs! Endured every season because of the silly amount of money they would spend on cr/p.

We should only allow American flagged cruise ships with American crews to operate in our country.   This would these ships to the liability laws and regulations which allow us to be safe.

2020-09-30 21:49,"It is rumored that the cruise lines will start out by only visiting their private islands.  I don't think many typical ports of call will allow these passengers in, anyway, no matter how badly they could use the tourist dollars because they understand the risks that are unique to cruise ships.  

If they sail only to those islands and back, I suppose they mitigate *some* of the risk but you still have thousands of people (even if sailing at reduced capacity, as is proposed) coming from all over the U.S., with many opportunities to pick up the virus along the way, who will be able to share it with others, who will then take it back home, with more stops along the way. 

Meanwhile, the crew members stay on board and act like human incubators for the virus.  No matter how often they test the crew, they aren't going to catch it before it has spread. And then what?

A dozen ships with a mix of those vaccinated and control group.  No stops along the way, just  a 4-6 week cruise, I'm certain big pharma can optimize the timing and quantity of ships.  Off on the SS ""Petri Dish"" all and give those vaccines a run for the money.  Satellite datalink data to shore, beef up the medical bays, and we'll have a working vaccine before Christmas!"

I can delay such gratification to a time when it is safe for us. The second part of the equation is that the cruises industry and this administration is putting the need for profit over the lives of those who will travel. They are essentially saying it is okay to risk the lives of some of you who want to take a cruise and get sick with coronavirus. Will you have to sign a waiver? I think I'll pass. Bon voyage."

Dr. Redfield, who has been scolded by President Trump for promoting mask wearing and cautioning that vaccines won’t be widely available until next year, worried before the Tuesday decision that he might get fired, and had considered resigning if he were required to oversee a policy that compromised public health, according to a senior administration official as well as a person close to Dr. Redfield.

But if passengers and crew go off ship, the virus is quite likely to come back on board with some of them.

The last one was about three yeas ago. This was long before the covid crisis.

Even then the cruise lines were aware pf the danger of onboard disease. 

The Disney line even provided antibiotic safety fluids at the entry to every eating venue. Since many activities were on deck exposed, while at sea, there was another layer of protection. 

The fact that many passengers on our cruises [TCM Classics] were older adults was a danger of which neither we, nor the cruise lines, were aware.

Proof of how little he cares Today in the Washington Post:

Trump plans to hold large campaign rallies in Wisconsin this weekend despite warnings from his own White House Coronavirus Task Force. The state is suffering some of the most severe covid-19 spread in the country, and the task force has flagged the metro areas of La Crosse and Green Bay as particularly dangerous “red zones.” Trump's campaign nevertheless plans to gather thousands of supporters in both locations Saturday.

Wisconsin is listed as the state with the third-highest rate of new cases in the country, with 243 new cases per 100,000 people over the previous week, ... its hospital in that city is at 94 percent capacity as covid-19 continues to spike in the community.

How anyone can believe he cares about his supporters, staff or anyone else simply baffles me.

He also has other rallies scheduled in high spiking states in spite of the administrations in the states asking him to re-consider. 

If you go to his rallies and you get sick, how will you re-elect him?  I don't think they think about that.  Or perhaps they just can't get past the fact that this entire thing is a hoax /s"

I don't know that this country is ever truly going to be rid of this virus, as it mutates quickly and we can't wrap our heads around the basic precautions of not spreading mostly eradicated diseases like measles, much less the extreme measures needed to stop this new Coronavirus.  If Cheeto-dust Voldemort's goal was isolationism, he may well achieve it with his virus mismanagement.  I'm curious how many countries will let Americans disembark and wander around freely? And how long that will last? Many countries require a two week quarantine upon arrival followed by a negative test result, so how does that work with a cruise?

Royal Caribbean, and others, put together a group of medical and organizational professions to create and submit a detailed safe sailing plan to the CDC before the no sail was set to expire.  These public opinions and the industry safe sailing plans seemed to fall on Redfield's deaf ears. What at least half, if not more, of the people submitting public opinions pointed out is that airlines (as well as theme parks etc.) are in operation despite an extremely high likelihood of close proximity and risky contact.  All the cruise industry is for asking is the same consideration.  With respect to all the epidemiologists on here stating cruise ships are ""death traps"" and ""petri dishes"", these are clearly knee jerk emotional responses.  These professional assessments notwithstanding, and what is supposed to be unbiased professional risk analysis from the CDC,  the fact remains that it could not be more unfair to allow these other industries to continue operating and not allow the cruise industry a chance to show they can do the same."

The thrust of the lecture’s argument was that “ our ancient immune systems have not evolved quickly “ enough in relation to the rapid rise of modern daily assaults on our immune systems from rapid population growth, the rise of settled populations, the domestication of animals, proximity to certain animals in the case of food supplies... e.g. bats, cows, pigs etc. increasing population densities, rapid industrialization etc. These and other variables have in inevitably led to the rise of many modern day maladies in which we must try to endure.

Some how going to a store, grocery, Home Depot, where you encounter a large group of people, is less likely to contact someone with virus than a health club because people breath?
It is selfish to require one group of citizens to give up their livelihoods for another.  If you feel that it is dangerous to leave your home than don't but don't require me to go broke for you.  
It is time for people to resume their lives, with the knowledge on how to interact with others.

This has cost the hospitality and travel industries a lot.  People don't like the restrictions,  But everyone wants to stay alive despite the inconvenience. 

Now, Europe's Covid cases are skyrocketing again.  Brazil and Mexico are hotspots, Mexico being a favored cruise ship destination.

Sept 5 they reported 3013 infections On Sept 26 they reported 104 deaths .   That is a  fatality Rate of 3.4%   

Wow that is a huge increase in the Case fatality rate that can only be explained if they are fudging the numbers on infections, or poisoning patients."
2020-10-01 12:01,Need there be any more said about the response to Covid-19? Anyone willing to go on a cruise ship at this time is playing Russian Roulette (pun intended). Wishful thinking and politics trumps (pun again) the CDC.
2020-10-01 12:18,"I would like to see Mr. & Mrs. Mike Pence and Mr. & Mrs. Donald Trump all take a cruise as an example to us all. If they do it, and test negative after quarantining for 14 days, then we'll know it's safe."

Of couse, the Republicans are intent still to starve literally and to cast out of shelter anyone who is out of work without income because we have a deficit. On the other hand, billions are spent on foreign aid, military enhancements, and governmental perks like rides around the country to rallies by the president. Who are we kidding, if not ourselves, that an administration and its party have mishandled the pandemic and now the economy and surely more lives per capita than any other nation!"
2020-10-01 10:07,"I guess there is now a highly functioning case tracking g system throughout Florida and the rest of the country along with a good supply of patient beds, ER capabilities, infection control and treatment supplies in hospitals so, yeah, get on that cruise liner.  

That the WH is saying they “follow the science” is odd.  The “ science” is what CDC does.  They (used to) collect and analyze real life data to make evidence based decisions.  

Please note the driver described for this decision is not that communities are healthier, but that the cruise lines are politically powerful.

I can't imagine a worse place to start a cruise than in the coronavirus hotspot of Florida with a governor who has just opened everything up and pretends the virus doesn't exist. And yet, the White House (speaking for the CDC) says that this is a great time to start cruising because Florida needs the tourism dollars and Trump needs the Florida votes. No wonder no one believes the CDC!"

2020-10-01 10:18,"To show their true allegiance and patriotism the anti-mask folks and trump supporters should be rewarded with a cruise out of Florida. No masks and hand sanitizing stations please!

Trump always has a conflict of interest in everything he has done as a president. Today is all about open tourism so Donald can fill his Florida hotels and golf courses. 

Public service is not his interest, it never is  on the side of “making America great” empty slogan. Its about “make Donald trump money again”.   As if we are not still in the middle of the public health crisis."
2020-10-01 10:58,"Right now, the HVAC systems of the cruise ships are perfect means of being super spreaders! At the very least, these systems need to be reworked before these ships can even be considered for return to commercial system. I will not even consider booking any trips on these at t;his time. The horrors of customers trapped without a country for days to week at a time are still too fresh! Trump has proven to be no caring friend of adding to their misery!"

2020-10-01 3:40,"Given what happened this year with cruise and cargo ships, with passengers and crew trapped on board for weeks, it is surprising anyone would want to cruise. 

Florida cruises, with more asymptomatic children and anyone willing to cruise right now, seems like a perfect storm for infection. 

As demonstrated by the Sturgis Motorcycle Rally (SMR), it is hard to assign responsibility for specific events but the empirical evidence for SMR super spreading in midwestern states is pretty overwhelmingright now.

Florida cruises will be the next super spreader event."

2020-10-01 4:36,If anything we should ban cruise ships.  The Covid epidemic has rendered these behmoths useless.  Cruise ships are a cesspool of microbes and a point of high stress from too big of a crowd that is subjected to uncessant entertainment and drinking.
2020-10-01 12:25,How likely is it that insurance will cover passengers?
2020-10-01 12:39,Ignorance is bliss I suppose.
2020-10-01 13:25,"Even if we believed that the unholy coalition of Trump and DeSantis we’re doing this for the economic health of the industry, it is useful to think about where that money goes. These ships, for the most part, are not flagged in the U.S., nor, are they headquartered here in anyway that sends their fair share of taxes into American coffers ( kind of like the president himself). The vast majority of all people employed on the ships are not Americans, or American based workers, and very few of them are paid well anyway so that their contribution in earning power going back into our economy even when they are docked here is minimal. Furthermore, the design of most cruise terminals with their fake local themed shops are all paying rent to the cruise companies, and except for low paying temporary work, little money actually ever goes to local small businesses. And, then there is the pollution problem. Not simply restricted to the dirtiest of dirty oil, bunker fuel, pollutes the oceans at a cost to local fisherman and other less invasive tourist activities. And let’s not even get started on the amount of garbage and food waste. And as far a local economies, Disney, for example, in Orlando, does everything it can to make certain that passengers on their ships do not spend a single cent outside of their corporate control by delivering their passengers to and from their cruise ships, with their coach buses, to their themes parks. Local businesses see very, very little benefit."
2020-10-01 13:39,"To which countries do these cruise lines wish to export the virus? 

The idea that healthy countries will accept visitors from the most infected country on earth -- the U.S. -- is absurd. 

Americans who want to visit countries where Covid is soaring are potential Darwin Award winners.

Countries outside the U.S. have had far better success at controlling Covid with strict travel, social distsncing and masking measures, enforced by fines. 

Hospitality and travel industries have lost revenue. People chafe at the restrictions. 

Now, Europe's Covid cases are skyrocketing again, due to illness from August vacationers and schools re-opening. 

Brazil and Mexico are hotspots.  Mexico is a favored cruise ship destination. 

Travel from the U.S. to Europe is banned. Many Americans flaunt simple protections, like masks, and their presence is unwanted. 

Where do the cruise lines propose shipping Covid vectors?  It's clear wealth trumps health for them."
2020-10-01 13:01,Isn’t this discussion moot? Where would they cruise to? Out in a circle and back? No country would admit them.

I have read and heard many fairy tales and outright lies from the abomination of an administration of Trump’s, but, this lie is over the top.

Trump and his court jesters possibly have more belief in snake oil as a cure for cancer than believing that science has a better cure.

Well, let those who wish to cruise go for it.  But, I ask, please do not be a burden on the already overworked health care providers.  Instead, set a cot up on the lawns of the White House."

I only hope potential cruise goers have more brains than he gives them credit for. Why would anyone in his right mind board a cruise ship before the pandemic is brought under control! As they say, such ships are floating petri dishes!!!!!"
2020-10-01 12:57,"Redfield should stand up for, and publicly say, what he believes.  If Trump fires him, he should continue publicly saying what he believes (there are plenty of reporters out there).  He has hurt the country, and people have died, while he has dithered about, trying to please Trump.  He should do the right thing, and tell the truth, so that lives may be saved."
2020-10-01 13:48,"To those of you who are calling cruise ships ""floating petri dishes,"" I'd ask if you've ever cruised? Cruise ships are far cleaner than most land based establishments and they have been working for years to curb the spread of various types of infections on board. 

And to those complaining of pollution, know that new ships are very clean. 99% of what comes out of the smokestack on the new Celebrity Edge, for instance, is steam. The pollutants are scrubbed out and offloaded as solid waste.

The White House has not restarted cruising, yet. In fact, my understanding from an article in Axios is that their plan is to take a month-to-month look at restarting cruising rather than simply stopping it for another 1/4 year. 

Ships are flagged overseas, but these are US corporations and their stock is traded on the US stock exchanges. Workers are largely from other, poorer countries; those workers and their families have been economically devastated by the shutdown. Also devastated are the economies of many of the port cities in impoverished nations that depend on the tourism brought by the cruise ships.

Before you completely demonize the industry, remember that cruise lines were on the front line of delivering relief to Caribbean nations impacted by horrific hurricanes over the past few years. They brought critical supplies and even donated cash to reconstruction efforts. 

Please do a little deeper dive before judging this industry. It isn't as awful as many want to believe it is."
2020-10-01 14:03,"I've never been on a cruise and am not claiming to know whether a cruise is or is not safe at this point in time. But I have seen enough from the Trump administration to know that any decision it makes is based on politics, profits, or both. 

This latest decision to block the new CDC order is quite consistent with the MAGA death cult. Specifically, anyone defending the cleanliness of ships is missing the point - even if evidence were shown that ships were dangerous, the White House wouldn't care."

Talk about contaminated surfaces, no two people can pass each other without ceding right of way in the halls to the other. During this pandemic people must think for themselves. thrump will be making decisions for money makers not lives."
2020-10-01 14:21,Let them sail if they want.  Pretty sure they would not be able to line up enough passengers to make it worthwhile however.   Also nice to know Karma is at work since these companies are all incorporated overseas as tax dodges.
2020-10-01 14:31,"I think the cruise industry is concerned about the health of their passengers more  than Trump or the republicans. 

Even if Trump allows the ships to sail into a pandemic horror story, the cruise operators will not let it happen because it will be suicide.

However look for Trump and the republicans to bail out the cruise industry monetarily even though they pay little federal tax like airlines and hotels and others do since the cruise operators are registered in foreign countries."
2020-10-01 14:22,"We now know from Donald's taxes that he is in hock up to his eyeballs and desperately needs to keep hotels open, hospital ships aren't attractive and don't pull in the kind of clientele his establishments can serve. It is a conflict of interest, similar to the Russians controlling most of the $421 million that he owes, he can be and IS BEING manipulated.

Trump's self interest has already cost 200,000 lives with his call to the proud boys to ""stand by and be ready"" he is clearly demonstrating that he'll start another civil war with still more dead to follow. 

Dump Trump AND his sycophants wherever located in our government."
2020-10-01 15:21,"Busses are crowded and people standing close to each other, Schools are opened, people when revolting are crowded in thousands, so why is that only Sailing and Flying soo risky. Sailing is supposed to be more safe than living on land. If the CDC can impose ban on Sailing and Flying, they must also impose ban on travelling by bus and taxies, risk is same in all mode of transport. We need smart and intellectual people in these positions not stupid's."
2020-10-01 15:00,"I used to be a frequent cruiser, until now.  I now know better than to entrap myself onto a floating petri dish.  In the many times I've cruised, I fell ill or came off the vessel in a less healthy state then I embarked.  In one of these health encounters, both my wife and I became violently ill, self isolated ourselves into our cabin for no other reason than we couldn't stand upright for prolonged periods, and stayed so for the following four weeks.

I somewhat agree that ship operators do their very best to provide a clean and safe environment for their passengers.  But all it takes is one sick person to spread a contagion.  Touch places for transmission are unlimited.  Passengers are packed in like sardines in a can.  The capacity for the spread of illness is limitless.  Medical staff are ill equipped to deal with outbreaks, resorting to cabin quarantine as a last resort.  Finally, I'll use one phrase to capture the danger of the spread of illness on board ships, along with the hopelessness faced by passengers.  Diamond Princess.  

So if you think Diamond Princess is fake news, go right ahead and sail, enjoy yourself, and possibly the time you left before you meet your maker."
2020-10-01 15:20,"Good to know these various task forces are postulating what a safe re-opening of the industry will require, and what new protocols must be implemented to do so.

But why not also look toward those companies, like MSC, who have successfully re-opened their mega ships in the mediterranean, following scrupulous regimens to assure the health safety of their guests and employees.

I am dismayed that the press, in general, has vilified the cruise industry, faulting any negative news they can find.  As enclosed spaces with high traffic (like a cruise ship) can typically act like a petri dish for any infectious pathogens, the cruise lines have in the past and will in the future, face this challenge (not just in the time of Covid) and have been largely mindful of and compliant with USPH and other regulations governing the safety of those aboard.

On Monday, October 8th, the Seatrade Cruise Virtual Expo will be held, and many topics of discussion will include a safe return to a new normal, and what is being done by the cruise lines and their partners to facilitate this.  I suggest some coverage of that event to both inform your readership and balance the negativity that has pervaded the press."

2020-10-01 12:05,"Trump doesn't care if 200K die, why would he care if Grandma and Grandpa bites it on a cruise ship? Love that sweet taste of freedom.

Temperature checks are the new version of TSA. People dose with Motrin and Tylenol before hand. Put a wet cloth on your forehead and wrist for a minute. Hell, I had COVID-19, and never ran a temperature above 99.1F.  To me, it's meaningless aggravation.

People lie to save face. My doctor friends tell me how people are not telling all their symptoms to get cleared for work. You bet, if someone has a 99.2F temp, and a $8K cruise on the line, they'll be hitting the fever reducers, decongestants and antihistamines to get on board.

Hard pass until 2022."
2020-10-01 16:06,"The explanation for ignoring CDC recommendations is simple political calculation.

2020-09-30 18:01,"""He also said that the group’s other recommendations, such as allowing fewer passengers, enforcing mask wearing and installing improved air filtration systems, aim to limit the spread of the virus on a ship should an infected passenger board.""

""Recommendations"" are gratifying, but lack teeth. The CDC's only tooth is the no-sail order. Who polices the cruise lines to be sure they have upgraded their HVAC and will ensure passengers wear masks? 

I speak as someone who loves cruising, and had two cruises canceled this year. Still, I am not confident about returning to the sea, if only mere ""recommendations"" are in play."

2020-09-30 18:21,Anyone who chooses to take the risk and sail in the midst of a pandemic should be required to sign a waiver of liability.

2020-09-30 18:32,"Mandatory c19 tests before boarding for each passenger, no exceptions, is a good start.   Masks and  social distancing aboard the ships will be difficult to enforce.

We don't care who relieves what restructions: you couldn't get us on a cruise liner if you paid for the entire voyage.  We've stayed home since early March, and we're not going anywhere before next summer, at best.  Even then, the thought of doing anything social with a lot of people in a confined space---airplane, bus, train, or ship--is not on the list, perhaps forever.  We're grateful for the trips we've been able to make, and that's enough."
2020-09-30 18:40,"It does appear that Redfield has decided to challenge
his bosses publicly and frontally when deemed appropriate.  

The conclusion will be inevitable even if politically damaging.  

Presumably, Redfield believes that he is in a stronger position since his firing would not go down well with the public that is still capable of paying attention. So he's playing tough and looking for effective payback given the recent incursions on CDC's turf by political appointees in HHS or WH who insist upon interfering with CDC recommendations.

But belief in such institutional insularity and strength  is contingent upon his position being within a normally functioning democratic government. 

Anyone paying the slightest attention surely must realize that this is surely not what we are living in at present. 

So, it is also just as  likely that Redfield will soon be joining the ranks of former government employees, leaving behind

Otherwise, people who take these cruises deserve what they catch (and may not be able to get medical care for in any timely way)."

2020-09-30 18:17,"You’d have to be nuts to take a cruise right now. In the best of times there are outbreaks of norovirus, but who would want to risk getting such a deadly disease like Covid. Also why do these potential passengers think they would be able to even disembark anywhere. Americans aren’t welcome to fly into most country. Why do they think countries would welcome us from a cruise ship, a virtual incubator of germs. Don’t people remember what happen to the ship in Japan, where passengers were stranded in the harbor for at least 2 weeks, since authorities wouldn’t let them get off the ship. Meanwhile more and more got infected. Trump himself wouldn’t let a ship with mostly American passengers dock in San Francisco in March, because a few passengers were sick and Trump didn’t want to “ruin his numbers.” He’d do the same thing to any new passengers.

What a joke that Trump’s cronies said the passengers would wear masks and practice social distancing when one of them do any of that while on land. The ship when it set sail would really be A “ship of fools.l"

2020-09-30 18:12,"To appeal to Florida swing state voters, Trump wants to make their shorelines the destination of choice for thousands of infected virus vectors just like the Diamond Princess passengers and crew.

I didn't realize the suicidal demographic was considered an important one to court in Florida. Trump knows the senior citizens along the southern coast are the people with the most to lose from this proposition, yes? 

Meanwhile, thanks to the lack of a competent  national response to suppress the virus and enable a test and trace protocol, Orlando's theme parks are no longer economically viable. Disney's layoffs, long in coming, have made sure another 28,000 people or so have nothing better to do on election day than vote. While Republicans try to minimize their unemployment insurance.

I guess the politically suicidal demographic is running the Trump campaign in Florida. Wow, all of a sudden Brad Parscale's trajectory makes perfect sense."
2020-09-30 18:13,"Clearly, it's time for Dr. Redfield to (finally) take sides--does he serve science and public health and the American people, or does he serve political masters who actively undermine science and endanger Americans' lives over and over?  Stand up to the White House, or resign.  He's trying to play a lose-lose-lose game.  He's tearing apart the CDC and professionalism he presumably cares about by caving in to unhinged White House and HHS political appointees.  He can't please them, regardless of how much he compromises himself.  He's also lost all credibility and his professional reputation.  Remember C. Everett Koop and his decision to stand up to the Reagan Administration and help fight AIDS?  Redfield is no C. Everett Koop, at least not yet."
2020-09-30 18:13,When is Redfield resigning?  And when will he reveal what has really gone on in those meetings?
2020-09-30 18:42,"This is a disaster waiting to happen.  It will be a Petri Dish.  All it takes is one infected crewmember or passenger to start the process.  Why not insist that the ship make no port calls for two days before debarkation in Florida?  That way any infected individuals will be detectable by a rapid COVID test which must be administered to every passenger and crewmember before anyone disembarks.  If someone fails then a quarantine is required for the entire ship until the health department is satisfied that the risk is mitigated.  

I think it’s fine if people want to risk a cruise.  It is not OK to come back and infect innocent citizens.  Then again, they're coming back to a state where everything, including bars and restaurants, is operating at full capacity.  Maybe it doesn't matter."
2020-09-30 18:48,When will the CDC learn to stop making health and safety pronouncements when President Trump will do it for them and make certain his message comes through loud and strong no matter how much laughter it provokes?  The President believes  in his special wisdom no matter how great the risk is to the rest of us.  We need a trusted group outside of the government and the President's direction to give reliable information to us.
2020-09-30 19:09,"My husband and I retired to Florida.  What a mistake.  DeSantis last week fully opened restaurants and bars and since his announcement, there has been a significant decrease in shoppers wearing face masks.  

By opening the ports, the cruise traffic will add a significant layer of danger to the residents of Florida.  This state has a large population of the most vulnerable.  We will soon again lead the nation in Covid cases.  DeSantis, Rubio, and Scott have no concern for the average Floridian."
2020-09-30 19:23,"Sure, put more people at risk in the misguided hope of inspiring a more robust economic reopening when the science predicts and our experience has so far shown the likely outcome to be at the expense of a higher positivity rate, more infections, linger illnesses and death; and in the end without true feeling and being safe we really cannot have a robust economic resurgence that goes beyond the ups and downs of Wall Street.  But this administration persists in undermining the credibility of its experts.  Its own credibility, of course, is and has long been in tatters."
2020-09-30 19:39,"I want to say, ""Who would step onto a cruise ship today?"" But I won't say that, because I've already read the stories about people lining up for flights to nowhere. 

Think I'll stay home. Now, that was an easy decision."
2020-09-30 19:41,"I agree let them sail, BUT it even one person tests positive during the cruise 
crew or passengers all must stay on board for 14 day quarantine after last positive test. Yes it is POLITICAL when politicians overrule doctors and scientists where PROFIT out weighs HEALTH."
2020-09-30 19:51,"The cruiselines were already planning on not sailing in October so this does not change much for them operationally at least. What is surprising to me is why there would be a no-sail order for cruiselines and not a comparable no-fly order for airlines? I personally do not plan to cruise or fly until there is a vaccine but it is rather surprising frankly.  I agree that the Princess ship in Japan was a debacle but that was when COVID 19 was not on anyone's radar - and we can't know how that is unfolding in planes either - since we have no thorough contact tracing mechanism in place. In any case, even if the order is lifted - the issue is going to be one of demand really."
2020-09-30 19:57,"Newspaper readers were warned long ago about norovirus outbreaks on cruise ships.  Then we read about the Diamond Princess outbreak of the coronavirus, and the scores of ships circling aimlessly with no port willing to let them dock.  I conclude that the only people willing to get back on these plague ships are those who oblivious to all news of their dangers.  Bon voyage."
2020-09-30 19:59,"My thought? Just go for it. If this is how the Trump Administration and Florida Republicans want to handle the pandemic and the reopening of the cruise ship industry, just do it. But be ready to accept the consequences of more outbreaks, although it’s something neither the administration nor Florida Republicans will ultimately do. And to those who take a cruise, be sure to totally understand the risks and read the fine print."
2020-09-30 19:59,"Who exactly are they going to get to staff those floating ships of death?  What liability will the lines take for their employee health? None, just like the taxes they don't pay in the US."
2020-09-30 20:00,"I don’t see how the Cruise Ship Industry generates $53 billion dollars for the U S economy.

The cruise ships are not built in the United States.  The crews are at least 95 percent non American.  All the ships are registered in foreign countries.  Most cruise lines are owned by foreign entities.  And most all money that cruise lines earn go into foreign banks.

How does the cruise industry help the United States economy?"
2020-09-30 20:02,"I like to go on cruises, but it is 100% guaranteed that I will not even look at itineraries until there is a vaccine and/or infection rates less than 1% for several weeks.  The cruise industry can send their floating petri dishes out to see if they want, but they should expect a very bad outcome."
2020-09-30 20:06,"There's a difference between personal health and public health. Your doctor can urge you to quit smoking, quit eating sugar, get more exercise, or whatever it is that will improve your chances against the disease you have or might acquire -- but it is ultimately up to you, even though your death may grieve those near to you. Public health, on the other hand, pays attention to risks to the public as a whole. Let those who want to go on cruises take their lives in their own hands? As a matter of public health, that's unacceptable -- because those people travel from all over the country to get on board that cruise, and disperse to all over the country when it is over. And, it should go without saying, public health should always be guided by the best scientific and medical information available, and never by politics or special interests."
2020-09-30 20:09,"This is one of the reasons that Governor DeSantis has been so busy pandering to Trump. Although I don't see how Florida makes that much money from cruise ship passengers. They sometimes spend a night before their cruise in a hotel or maybe the ship stops in Key West. But the cruise companies make all the money, and they are not even registered in the US. 
We have the best infectious disease doctors in the world and we are not even listening to them."
2020-09-30 20:11,Good luck with that. Cruise ships were a Petrie dish way before Covid happened. I wouldn’t take a cruise if it was free.
2020-09-30 18:45,"The key to opening up, whether it's cruise ships or bars and nightclubs, is getting the pandemic under control. DeSantis is a bigger threat to the tourism industry in Florida than federal regulations. 

 An immediate issue is what happens to the passengers when a ship is at sea for a few days and a passenger tests positive. Do they get quarantined on their ""floating petri dish?"" That prospect would sure deter me from cruising. 

There were a number of instances of diseases breaking out on cruise ships before COVID-19 came along. It's not enough to get ships sailing. They have to be carrying enough passengers that it makes economic sense to put out to sea rather than to park them and wait out the pandemic. Rebuilding passenger confidence is going to be a heck of a job."
2020-09-30 19:03,"Potential votes trump health and life. 

The Vice-President and Mrs Pence can demonstrate leadership and go on the first cruise, without the special protections against Covid-19 that they receive because of his office, and interact extensively with crew and passengers.   If one or both contract Covid-19, that's progress toward herd immunity.   Come to think about it, the more crew and passengers that contract Civid-19, the more progress there is toward herd immunity."
2020-09-30 19:39,"This decision will pose a health hazard for the entire country.  

Why is it that C.D.C. orders don't trump (so to speak) political considerations?  And where are all the U-boats when you need one?"
2020-09-30 19:47,"At age 69, Dr. Redfield is worried about being fired? I wonder which is more important to him; going out voluntarily with his head held high or remaining in his position and, for all practical purposes, silenced by this president who prefers to accept guidance from a radiologist?

Redfield might exert far more influence on the nation's health by speaking out than being shut out."
2020-09-30 19:54,"Two things - is everybody now off the ships that were quarantined? I hear no because no country would take them.
Second, the cruise ships should add a guaranteed $500,000 compensation package to anyone who contracts Covid while cruising."
2020-09-30 20:07,"My wife and I have really enjoyed cruising, but there is absolutely NO WAY we are going on a cruise until 2022 (most likely 2023 or never.)  You'd have to be nuts to go on a cruise this year or early next year.  I predict if that happens we'll be reading all about a re-visit of the Diamond Princess mess.  Will Florida be happy to welcome back returning cruise ships with infected passengers and crew on board?
No thanks to cruising.  We'll miss it, but at least we did get to go on a few B4 the whole cruise industry circled the drain."
2020-09-30 19:15,"Even a small, bare-bones cruise ship sailing the remote Norwegian fjords this summer had a C-19 outbreak.  Norway has done an exemplary job in containing the virus.  If Norwegians couldn’t manage to keep cruises safe, then in no way do I trust the floating casinos to do so."
2020-09-30 19:24,"""Republican politicians in Florida and cruise industry lobbyists have called for ending the no-sail order.""

Well, there you have it -- lobbyists and politicians from FL writing the CDC guidelines for allowing cruise ships to sail again.
Of course it will be quite funny if various ports in other countries decide to not allow passenger ships from the US to dock because they don't want the virus to spread to their population."
2020-09-30 19:30,"The undermining of the CDC has got to stop. Republicans leaders (Grassley, Alexander, Bush, etc) must speak out to protect our institutions’ reputation and credibility. Otherwise we devolve into the Wild West.

Having taken lots of cruises (we get an in-state discount; I could ride my bike to the port), you won’t catch me sailing on one of the incubators. Hallways too narrow, stairways too crowded, passengers too selfish to follow rules. 

We’ll miss the revenue, but not the further extension of the lockdown restrictions."
2020-09-30 19:39,"What this Administration does not understand is that ordering (or allowing) businesses to open is secondary to controlling the virus and restoring confidence.  If customers do not believe a business is safe, it really doesn't matter what the Administration does.  Stunts like this only reinforce the perception that the responsible government agencies are being controlled/corrupted by craven politicians."
2020-09-30 19:43,"Just because you allow cruises to sail doesn’t mean customers will hurry to get on board. See what happened to Disney yesterday being forced to layoff a substantial part of their workforce because people still weren’t coming in droves to Orlando.

So unless one has been living under a rock and didn’t hear about the horrific cruise infections, lack of health measures for both staff and passengers, refusal by various countries, inc the US, for infected ships to dock, the last place you want to be is on a cruise ship.

But hey, since there are still people who believe in the Donald, refuse to wear masks. think it’s a hoax or they’re now immune, I suppose there may be a few fools willing to shell out money to risk their lives."
2020-09-30 19:50,"It sounds to me like Dr. Redfield better update his resume.
And the cruise industry is going to be in the same pickle as the airlines.  That would be closing operations probably after the first cruises."
2020-09-30 19:51,"The government is out of control with nobody at the helm. This is surreal and, frankly, scary that Trump can do this by fiat."
2020-09-30 20:10,"I will be first in line for a cruise. I have 5 booked in the next 6 months and have plans on booking 2 more. A cruise will be the safest place to be. I love to hear ALL of you say you won't cruise because the less people on the ship, the better. Hope my November cruise is a go !!!"
2020-09-30 18:27,I enjoy cruising but now is not the time to restart.
2020-09-30 18:29,Another reason you can't trust the cdc and the GOP. Money before health. Cruise if you want but stay out of NY.
2020-09-30 19:31,"Cruise ships are floating pestilences. They are heavy contributors to climate change pollutants and are poison to the health of every living organism at sea which are the primary source of oxygen to our planet along with our forests.

It is a crime to allow these toxic floating hotels to pollute our seas.   This industry should not exist."
2020-09-30 19:56,"You'd have to have a ""death wish"" to leave on a cruise from a florida port any time before we have a safe and effective vaccine with a majority of the population accepting a vaccine.  And where will cruise ships from the US be allowed to dock?  Probably only the Carribbean and some South American countries where the virus continues to rage."
2020-09-30 20:11,"The cruise industry does not pay taxes to the US and this should be ended immediately if Biden wins. 
They also do not fully investigate their workers health and past criminal records. Women who are raped on cruises are not protected by US law. The cruise industry launders money through their casinos which are not properly regulated. The cruise industry should be ended the way it is set up."
2020-09-30 18:29,Is there a fund I can contribute to that will encourage Trump supporters to take cruises by helping to subsidize their tickets?
2020-09-30 18:36,"Oh gosh, I can't think of anything more enjoyable than spending a week (or more, maybe MUCH more if there's a virus breakout) on a tightly packed ship, passing each other in the narrow passageways, singing drunken karaoke together, eating and drinking together (no masks worn in the dining areas, because you can't eat and drink with a mask on), exercise classes together, sharing teensy pools with kids screaming ""Marco Polo"" every three seconds, and let's not forget the shore excursions cheek-by-jowl on buses! 

Of course, passengers can take extra precautions and drink a little bleach or Lysol before boarding, and they'll be fully protected! 

Cruise ships were, and still are, floating virus factories. Shutting them down until late 2021 is what would have been appropriate."
2020-09-30 19:04,"Gosh, is it possible that cruise ships are perfect petri dishes for spreading Covid-19? How can CDC say such a thing? Aren't they as safe as aircraft carriers?

I mean, has there been a single outbreak on one since, June? They can't make a profit at 1/3 full, so just fill 'em up and let 'em sail. Let the passengers wander through all those ports and then come right back to the good old USA! No risk there. Remember, mask and distancing rules do not apply past 12 miles off-shore, so have fun at dinner, the discos, and the casinos. 

And we'll have fun, fun, fun hoping magic keeps the covid away."
2020-09-30 19:05,"“It's going to disappear. One day, it's like a miracle, it will disappear.”

“And it will go away. Just stay calm. It will go away.”

“I'll be right eventually.  It's going to disappear, and I'll be right.”

2020-09-30 19:11,"Trump is missing out on an important fact. Just because you open the economy, schools, and now cruise ships doesn' mean everyone's going to feel safe coming back. 

What will he do when there are countries that won't allow a curise ship to dock? Declare war?"
2020-09-30 19:22,"Let them go on a cruise, as long as anybody coming back to shore stays for 14 days locked in a hotel (not of his choice) and pays for food and lodging. This is how people can travel to Australia or Malaysia these days. Compulsory quarantine upon arrival."
2020-09-30 19:48,"By refusing to do an actual national lockdown, the USA has turned itself into a Covid incubator, constantly feeding the virus new hosts so it can reproduce.
The more virus we make, the more opportunities it has to mutate into more deadly or more easily transmitted forms.

More virus and more strains of the virus is not the way to reopen the economy.

Trump said nine months ago that we would go from fifteen cases to zero, even though he know full well he was lying.

If the USA doesn't get serious about controlling Covid this will get worse before it gets better. Ideal is now in a second lock down.

Trump supporters are putting Altoona lives at risk, because they would rather repeat lies in support of their anti-constitutional president than actually save the USA from danger."
2020-09-30 20:05,But of course it comes down to Florida. I hope to god that Bloomberg's money can flip the state blue. It's the only good thing he will have done since he ruined New York City.
2020-09-30 18:50,"We are cruisers but concerned  about cruising during the pandemic.  We got a promotional brochure for Holland America cruises offering terrific discounts on Caribbean cruises this winter and spring, so we called for details, ready to book if we could get a March or April cruise with assurances we could cancel if the virus was still a problem.  Our consultant told us in so many words that the discounts weren't worth the health risk and we would have to pre-pay everything upfront for the discounts.  Clearly the cruise lines are hurting and need some cash now.  We didn't schedule and were thankful that the consultant was honest about the risks."
2020-09-30 19:31,"The White House says forcing the CDC to allow ships to sail is not a political act, please no one believes that!  Trump is even or behind Vice President Biden and he is desperate to win there his ""home state"", its all political.  Shame on Rubio and Scott they are listening to a man who has no respect for his experts or the science and show the same disrespect for their constituency that the president does.  At some point down the line there will be deaths on the cruise ships and the finger should point directly at Scott and Rubio for siding with the president and not the citizens of Florida."
2020-09-30 19:32,Dr. Redfield seems more interested in keeping his job than doing his job.
2020-09-30 19:32,"Not shocked at all. The cruise lines have put off officially until end of October but many ships are not scheduled to launch until next April as it is.

Trump knows his base though. Don't get in between them and an all you can eat buffet."
2020-09-30 20:00,"It's obvious people are going to die from this decision, because cruise ships have always been petri dishes for diseases, such as Norwalk, another virus. Can you imagine being trapped with 4,000 other people aboard a ship, and told when you can leave? When I visit relatives in Miami Beach, we can see the cruise ship customers, people from all over the country, milling around downtown with their backpacks, doing last-minute shopping before boarding these monstrous ships. Governor ""Mini-Me"" DeSantis and his (hoped for) future boss Trump will do anything to make the country appear normal, just before election day. They do. not. care. about new casualties from the pandemic."
2020-09-30 20:23,"My husband and I were very frequent cruisers, very frequent.  We are in our late 80's and really miss cruising, not only the cruise, but the planning and excitement of figuring out where we want to go next or just stay on the ship and cruise.    
However, at this time we will not plan for or go on a cruise until we are absolutely sure of their safety.  We will wait until there is a safe vaccine and then reconsider.  
Meanwhile I wish good health and safety to all the crew member who always took good care of us."
2020-09-30 20:28,"Who is going to be foolish enough to book a trip on a cruise ship.  Cruise ships have already been proven to be incubators for Covid-19. In the unlikely event that every single asymptomatic passenger did not have Covid-19 and the ship was completely safe when it first sailed, what about the first stop when tourists disembark.  Will none of them come into contact with a Covid carrier while ashore.  Repeat this by the number of spots the ship is expected to make and the reality of the danger becomes apparent. And when the ship does return with several cases on board, will Trump allow them to disembark? He didn't last time."
2020-09-30 20:41,"To do cruise ships safely they have to (rapid) test crew and passengers, just before they enter isolation for 2 weeks in individual (land based) cabins (preferably on an island).  Do another rapid test before they can board the ship.  Then you can sail them around, but NOT allow them to get off the ship at any place.  Finally after whatever number of days at sea, they can be allowed to get back to land."
2020-09-30 20:41,"The Governor of Florida did not call his state to be God's Waiting Room in jest. Working with the DeSantis in the White House, he is making sure that it is so in every possible way.

They all are quite deadly serious with this reopening thing, without paying a fraction of the attention needed  to actually mitigate the virus. Have a plan to control the virus, control it, and it would naturally lead to freer movement of people and the reopening of businesses."
2020-09-30 20:43,"Aside from being cosmically dangerous to overrule the scientists, it's also fairly pointless because no countries are willing to accept the ships in their ports, especially from the country that account for 20% of the cases but only 4% of the population."
2020-09-30 20:52,"The cruise lines are incorporated overseas, which means that these cruise companies pay little to no taxes in the US. But it is the US that will be left to pick up the healthcare bill for everyone who gets COVID-19. So US taxpayers will be on the hook for Trump's cronies once again.

Oh, but that's OK for a President who thinks it's OK for him and his friends to avoid taxes."
2020-09-30 20:53,I'm not really concerned with the CDC says because no one that I know of is getting on a cruise ship in the next 6 months. furthermore who wants to say a lot of Miami. so the cruise ships will go round trip from Miami into the Caribbean without being able to stop at any of the islands sounds like a great trip to me. and then the people come back to Miami and hopefully the states are from will quarantine them upon arrival for 14 days. or in best case because they're on the water for six to eight days anybody that comes down with a virus requires a ship to be quarantined and everybody tested and those that are negative can get off the ship and those that are positive gets down the ship for an indefinite period of time at the expense of the cruise line. Good luck
2020-09-30 21:10,"A reputation-saving resignation from Redfield should have occurred months ago when Trump was blathering about miracle cures and resisting mask wearing, social distancing, increased testing, quarantine and contact tracing.

2020-09-30 19:04,"A POTUS, no matter how ignorant, no matter how corrupt, no matter how misguided, yields an incredible amount of power. In this case, all of it is being used for evil and WE, the people, will continue to go down the toilet with each of trump’s flushes!

Every government worker should take heed because this POTUS will find a way to unlawfully and erroneously wield his corruption and ignorance in your lane one day. You will be surprised how far his reach has gone in 4 years.

But, regarding the cruise industry ... it is just another example of trump’s use of power to manipulate truth for his own purposes. 

And, the seniors that will surely buy their tickets, will — predictably — be the first to squeak and take no responsibility for their foolishness when people start getting sick and no country comes to their rescue.

And, other private sector businesses,  like the cruise industry, will make excuses for their misjudgment in valuing the almighty dollar over human life. 

But, in trump’s GREAT America, humans are sacrificial lambs to slaughter."

2020-09-30 20:33,Is anyone surprised that the White House puts Trump's political interests above the interests of the American people?  When will people finally admit that Trump doesn't care about them?  He cares only about his own financial and political interests.  This egregious action points clearly to this conclusion.
2020-09-30 20:36,"""Dr. Robert R. Redfield, the director of the C.D.C., had recommended the extension, worried that cruise ships could become viral hot spots, as they did at the beginning of the pandemic.""

2020-09-30 21:01,"When are the American people going to wake up to realize that the Republican plan to deal with the coronavirus and health care in general is to let the old and/or medically fragile die?  After all, a lot of deaths benefit the funeral industry, the health care industry profits, hospital stocks, etc, and lessen the strain on the American way of life in general?  With a mindset that considers the stock market the total sum of the economy and profit the bottom line of everything Americans can/should want, why continue to support those who cannot contribute to the profits?  After all, they’ve rigged the tax laws to maximize their own intake already.  Seriously, I am serious, this IS the Republican plan.  Open the schools since kids are expendable, teachers likewise, and why take care of all those retirees milking the Social Security and Medicare plans?  The callousness, the greed, are plain to see."

Trump and the white house can open cruises up but it is inevitable there will be a cruise that goes bad and no port of call will take them in..... then what happens?"

As to cruise ships. Gross! As to US cruise passengers...some of the worst tourists to travel. When I lived in the Caribbean, the worst days were when the ships shuttled their passengers for their day excursion to the island I lived on. Sun burnt, obnoxious oafs, waddling around the sights, uninformed about the basic history (slave trade) who only wanted burgers and fries and soda, instead of the delicious local fare. Insulting to the local culture, and downright slobs! Endured every season because of the silly amount of money they would spend on cr/p.

If you wanted to conduct a subversive campaign of germ warfare;then using cruise ships would be perfect way.   We should only allow American flagged cruise ships with American crews to operate in our country.   This would these ships to the liability laws and regulations which allow us to be safe.   I remember the first cruise ship to be quarantined off of California.

Keep them at anchor somewhere in the mid ocean in a high spot for the next 4 months. Air drop food and booze.  Do not let them disembark anywhere on this planet save maybe the TRUMP TOWER. I haven't figured out how that would work but the genius in the white house, being the smartest being on the planet probable could. 

Or, we do need to test some new anti ship weapons to meet the threat that the Chinese are posing to Taiwan. This might be a two birds with one stone approach."

2020-09-30 21:31,"Dr. Redfield should resign and then have an open discussion as a free citizen about the crazy politically motivated and mistaken decisions that are driving the COVID response.

With regards to the cruise industry --- these ships travel under the flag of another country even though they're american companies. Their short term tax avoidance scheme should not entitle them to US aid or consideration. Let them fail or reincorporate in the US and pay their fair share of taxes."

Caveat emptor those who buy a ticket"
2020-09-30 21:49,"It is rumored that the cruise lines will start out by only visiting their private islands.  I don't think many typical ports of call will allow these passengers in, anyway, no matter how badly they could use the tourist dollars because they understand the risks that are unique to cruise ships.  

If they sail only to those islands and back, I suppose they mitigate *some* of the risk but you still have thousands of people (even if sailing at reduced capacity, as is proposed) coming from all over the U.S., with many opportunities to pick up the virus along the way, who will be able to share it with others, who will then take it back home, with more stops along the way. 

Meanwhile, the crew members stay on board and act like human incubators for the virus.  No matter how often they test the crew, they aren't going to catch it before it has spread. And then what?  These workers, who are nearly all from foreign countries, will have to leave the ship for medical care.  Likely to the U.S.  Can we handle that additional strain on our health care system?"
2020-09-30 22:21,"Because of this issue and so many others, by far the best thing Dr. Redfield could do for public health is to resign and make clear the many ways in which Trump is contributing to tens of thousands of American deaths."
2020-09-30 22:27,"Knowing how easily the norovirus can sweep through the contained environment of a ship, despite ship companies’ often Herculean efforts to contain such outbreaks, why would any rational person take the substantial risk of contracting the potentially much more harmful coronavirus just to go on a short vacation? I’m sure a distinct minority of science deniers will sail at the first opportunity, but I don’t think most people -even Trump supporters - will start sailing again until there’s a safe, reliable vaccine."
2020-09-30 22:31,"What a fantastic opportunity to get a vaccine early!  Vaccine volunteers are doing their civic duty, but why not give them an all-expenses paid cruise as well!  A dozen ships with a mix of those vaccinated and control group.  No stops along the way, just  a 4-6 week cruise, I'm certain big pharma can optimize the timing and quantity of ships.  Off on the SS ""Petri Dish"" all and give those vaccines a run for the money.  Satellite datalink data to shore, beef up the medical bays, and we'll have a working vaccine before Christmas!"
2020-09-30 22:38,"Question: who besides a Trump supporter who thinks the pandemic is a hoax would buy a ticket in the foreseeable future? with no new interventions and the ongoing lack of adherence to mask wearing by those who call the pandemic a hoax the ability for cruise ships to successfully sail is in serious doubt. while I am getting a bit stir crazy for a vacation, I value my health and life as well as those of loved ones who would travel with me on such a trip. I can delay such gratification to a time when it is safe for us. The second part of the equation is that the cruises industry and this administration is putting the need for profit over the lives of those who will travel. They are essentially saying it is okay to risk the lives of some of you who want to take a cruise and get sick with coronavirus. Will you have to sign a waiver? I think I'll pass. Bon voyage."
2020-09-30 22:44,"This is confusing: 

Dr. Redfield, who has been scolded by President Trump for promoting mask wearing and cautioning that vaccines won’t be widely available until next year, worried before the Tuesday decision that he might get fired, and had considered resigning if he were required to oversee a policy that compromised public health, according to a senior administration official as well as a person close to Dr. Redfield.

trump has been living in lies and denial since it began and he intends on thinking that it will go away and that an emergency authorization for a vaccine is the way to go. in fact, it is the worst way to go for that kind of authorization will kill the data checking on the scale of the vaccine. also, it appears that some or all of these vaccines are focusing on mild versions of covid and will not help in strong or serious cases.

That would seem the only safe way to cruise, and that would not be a satisfactory vacation for most tourists. ""Look, you can see Venice about six miles off our starboard port."" But if passengers and crew go off ship, the virus is quite likely to come back on board with some of them. I was actually planning another cruise before COVID struck, but now you couldn't pay ME to take another cruise at my age until and unless I have been protected by a vaccine that is at least 70% effective.

His group could say they plan on testing everyone before boarding etc..but in reality it's not a variable that easy to control.   There still seems to be some unknowns.  Can we take the science more seriously.   It's innovative to try to think of a middle ground, but from other openings, it looks like even October would much too early."
2020-09-30 23:32,"I have been on seven cruses out of ports in Florida.

The last one was about three yeas ago. This was long before the covid crisis.

Even then the cruise lines were aware pf the danger of onboard disease. 

The Disney line even provided antibiotic safety fluids at the entry to every eating venue. Since many activities were on deck exposed, while at sea, there was another layer of protection. 

The fact that many passengers on our cruises [TCM Classics] were older adults was a danger of which neither we, nor the cruise lines, were aware.

These days, I believe cruises offer a suicidal, Russian Roulette,  choice.

Now they are responsible for the spread of a pandemic that has cost people so much. How is it possible that anyone but the brain dead would want to do such a thing?"

This season is going to see an increase in Covid and FL with its no holds barred attitude is going to be ground zero for cruisers.
I think it is selfish to inflict visitors to smaller Caribbean nations from a country that cannot even contain its own pandemic.
Do they not recall how difficult it was for those who'd been exposed and/or had Covid last year to get back to the US?
Or that this President wanted to refuse passengers re-entry?"
2020-09-30 23:46,"Anyone who chooses to go on a cruise ship is already putting him/herself at risk, with or without a pandemic. 
Packing many hundreds of people into a floating Petri dish provides a recipe for widespread transmission of all sorts of pathogens in the confined environment. Even without this risk, what else is there to do on a cruise besides eat, gamble, lounge around, eat, and gamble? And eat. Utter, expensive boredom. So to those who want to take the chance, I say ""Good luck and good riddance."" And eat."
2020-10-01 0:00,"Trump is losing badly in all polls.  That coupled with the fact that he doesn't care about anything but himself and staying out of jail when he loses the election have him panicked.

Proof of how little he cares Today in the Washington Post:

Trump plans to hold large campaign rallies in Wisconsin this weekend despite warnings from his own White House Coronavirus Task Force. The state is suffering some of the most severe covid-19 spread in the country, and the task force has flagged the metro areas of La Crosse and Green Bay as particularly dangerous “red zones.” Trump's campaign nevertheless plans to gather thousands of supporters in both locations Saturday.

Wisconsin is listed as the state with the third-highest rate of new cases in the country, with 243 new cases per 100,000 people over the previous week, ... its hospital in that city is at 94 percent capacity as covid-19 continues to spike in the community.

How anyone can believe he cares about his supporters, staff or anyone else simply baffles me.

He also has other rallies scheduled in high spiking states in spite of the administrations in the states asking him to re-consider. 

If you go to his rallies and you get sick, how will you re-elect him?  I don't think they think about that.  Or perhaps they just can't get past the fact that this entire thing is a hoax /s"
2020-10-01 0:39,"The cruise industry isn't ""the only industry that’s not allowed to operate at the moment,” : my husband is a REAC inspector (an independent contractor who inspects buildings with HUD loans) and almost none of them are allowed to work right now because going into a building full of people and looking around is a good way to spread the virus, just like riding around on a giant boat full of people, buffets, and pools is (and not working hurts people like us a lot more than it hurts the cruise industry or people who go on cruises).  
I don't know that this country is ever truly going to be rid of this virus, as it mutates quickly and we can't wrap our heads around the basic precautions of not spreading mostly eradicated diseases like measles, much less the extreme measures needed to stop this new Coronavirus.  If Cheeto-dust Voldemort's goal was isolationism, he may well achieve it with his virus mismanagement.  I'm curious how many countries will let Americans disembark and wander around freely? And how long that will last? Many countries require a two week quarantine upon arrival followed by a negative test result, so how does that work with a cruise?  
Maybe the boat is supposed to be the fun part?  With the food poisoning and pools with too many other people?  No thanks, by all means, if that's your thing, enjoy."
2020-10-01 0:57,"First of all the CDC invited public opinion on this issue and after reviewing hundreds of these opinions online, the great majority (90% plus) supported the restarting of cruises if implemented in a safe manner.  Royal Caribbean, and others, put together a group of medical and organizational professions to create and submit a detailed safe sailing plan to the CDC before the no sail was set to expire.  These public opinions and the industry safe sailing plans seemed to fall on Redfield's deaf ears. What at least half, if not more, of the people submitting public opinions pointed out is that airlines (as well as theme parks etc.) are in operation despite an extremely high likelihood of close proximity and risky contact.  All the cruise industry is for asking is the same consideration.  With respect to all the epidemiologists on here stating cruise ships are ""death traps"" and ""petri dishes"", these are clearly knee jerk emotional responses.  These professional assessments notwithstanding, and what is supposed to be unbiased professional risk analysis from the CDC,  the fact remains that it could not be more unfair to allow these other industries to continue operating and not allow the cruise industry a chance to show they can do the same."

The potential for contracting a wide assortment of diseases even in Non Pandemic Times is statistically heightened given the exceedingly close quarters and great numbers of passengers. In one of my undergraduate immunology courses my Professor gave a very fine lecture regarding disease, evolution and population densities. The thrust of the lecture’s argument was that “ our ancient immune systems have not evolved quickly “ enough in relation to the rapid rise of modern daily assaults on our immune systems from rapid population growth, the rise of settled populations, the domestication of animals, proximity to certain animals in the case of food supplies... e.g. bats, cows, pigs etc. increasing population densities, rapid industrialization etc. These and other variables have in inevitably led to the rise of many modern day maladies in which we must try to endure.

Done right, a cruise ship has the potential to be the safest vacation of all in these times.  The cruise industry has proposed strict requirements for both crew and passengers before sailing.

We learned that medical advise is constantly  changing ,based on laboratory studies, not how the real in the real world. And the studies done are subjective with different interruptions.  Some how going to a store, grocery, Home Depot, where you encounter a large group of people, is less likely to contact someone with virus than a health club because people breath?
It is selfish to require one group of citizens to give up their livelihoods for another.  If you feel that it is dangerous to leave your home than don't but don't require me to go broke for you.  
It is time for people to resume their lives, with the knowledge on how to interact with others. 
And for those elected officials ,health professionals, scientist et a, that the still believe in the illogic and absurdity of isolation, they must be required to give of their salaries to those that have been hurt by their advise.
What we learned is absurdity of the application of advise from the CDC.

This has cost the hospitality and travel industries a lot.  People don't like the restrictions,  But everyone wants to stay alive despite the inconvenience. 

Now, Europe's Covid cases are skyrocketing again.  Brazil and Mexico are hotspots, Mexico being a favored cruise ship destination.

These ships, for the most part, are not flagged in the U.S., nor, are they headquartered here in anyway that sends their fair share of taxes into American coffers ( kind of like the president himself). The vast majority of all people employed on the ships are not Americans, or American based workers, and very few of them are paid well anyway so that their contribution in earning power going back into our economy even when they are docked here is minimal. Furthermore, the design of most cruise terminals with their fake local themed shops are all paying rent to the cruise companies, and except for low paying temporary work, little money actually ever goes to local small businesses. And, then there is the pollution problem. Not simply restricted to the dirtiest of dirty oil, bunker fuel, pollutes the oceans at a cost to local fisherman and other less invasive tourist activities. And let’s not even get started on the amount of garbage and food waste. And as far a local economies, Disney, for example, in Orlando, does everything it can to make certain that passengers on their ships do not spend a single cent outside of their corporate control by delivering their passengers to and from their cruise ships, with their coach buses, to their themes parks. Local businesses see very, very little benefit."

And to those complaining of pollution, know that new ships are very clean. 99% of what comes out of the smokestack on the new Celebrity Edge, for instance, is steam. The pollutants are scrubbed out and offloaded as solid waste.

The White House has not restarted cruising, yet. In fact, my understanding from an article in Axios is that their plan is to take a month-to-month look at restarting cruising rather than simply stopping it for another 1/4 year. 

Ships are flagged overseas, but these are US corporations and their stock is traded on the US stock exchanges. Workers are largely from other, poorer countries; those workers and their families have been economically devastated by the shutdown. Also devastated are the economies of many of the port cities in impoverished nations that depend on the tourism brought by the cruise ships.

Before you completely demonize the industry, remember that cruise lines were on the front line of delivering relief to Caribbean nations impacted by horrific hurricanes over the past few years. They brought critical supplies and even donated cash to reconstruction efforts.

In the many times I've cruised, I fell ill or came off the vessel in a less healthy state then I embarked.  In one of these health encounters, both my wife and I became violently ill, self isolated ourselves into our cabin for no other reason than we couldn't stand upright for prolonged periods, and stayed so for the following four weeks.

I somewhat agree that ship operators do their very best to provide a clean and safe environment for their passengers.  But all it takes is one sick person to spread a contagion.  Touch places for transmission are unlimited.  Passengers are packed in like sardines in a can.  The capacity for the spread of illness is limitless.  Medical staff are ill equipped to deal with outbreaks, resorting to cabin quarantine as a last resort.  Finally, I'll use one phrase to capture the danger of the spread of illness on board ships, along with the hopelessness faced by passengers.  Diamond Princess.  

So if you think Diamond Princess is fake news, go right ahead and sail, enjoy yourself, and possibly the time you left before you meet your maker."

But why not also look toward those companies, like MSC, who have successfully re-opened their mega ships in the mediterranean, following scrupulous regimens to assure the health safety of their guests and employees.

I am dismayed that the press, in general, has vilified the cruise industry, faulting any negative news they can find.  As enclosed spaces with high traffic (like a cruise ship) can typically act like a petri dish for any infectious pathogens, the cruise lines have in the past and will in the future, face this challenge (not just in the time of Covid) and have been largely mindful of and compliant with USPH and other regulations governing the safety of those aboard.

On Monday, October 8th, the Seatrade Cruise Virtual Expo will be held, and many topics of discussion will include a safe return to a new normal, and what is being done by the cruise lines and their partners to facilitate this.

People lie to save face. My doctor friends tell me how people are not telling all their symptoms to get cleared for work. You bet, if someone has a 99.2F temp, and a $8K cruise on the line, they'll be hitting the fever reducers, decongestants and antihistamines to get on board.

This means putting that money for the so-called ""war on drugs"" that is being poured down the drain and ruining people's lives in the process -- taking that money and putting into TREATMENT and support services.  

And in the process, this new Treatment ""industry"" will give useful and positive employment to people in towns like Barret, Vt., where there is little else on offer.

2020-09-29 16:45,"My wonderful, talented, intelligent and experienced older son became addicted to drugs and alcohol about 12 years ago. Last year he ended up homeless in a very large major city where the drug trafficking is out in the open in some places. 

He had suffered from infections in the past, one of which nearly killed him and another which caused the amputation of his right thumb, a terrible loss for a man who played guitar. 

When the pandemic hit, he was unable to get any work and became very depressed. He had bipolar disorder and was unable to see a doctor who could prescribe the medications he was supposed to be taking. 

In mid-July I received a call from a hospital in the city. They told me that my son had been found unconscious on a sidewalk and taken to the hospital ER, where doctors discovered and removed an abscess on his spine. It had caused a massive infection, the cause of which they were unable to determine. 

On July 28th, my beautiful son passed away from sepsis caused by the infections, which resulted in organ failure. The official cause of death was cardiac arrest, but the real cause of his death was drug addiction. 

We need to do more as a nation to stop drugs like heroin and Fentanyl from coming into the country in the first place. We need more treatment centers where addicts can get clean and begin to rebuild their lives. And we have to do more for the large number of addicts who have ""dual diagnoses"" - addiction and mental illness."

In the case of drug/alcohol addiction, we are just offered up some other drug to be addicted to. This doesn’t solve the problem that is addiction. May I say that in my personal experience the best remedy for addiction is meditation. Yes, meditation is a sort of drug free medication. No doubt someone will come on here and call me a quack. No problem. Everyone has the freedom to choose.  However, I will say this, meditation requires a daily or near daily acceptance of one’s weaknesses and desires to feel better. If applied in a routine manner, meditation works extremely well. It’s a choice, but one that will not lead one down the road of craving for chemicals. But it’s a lifetime choice just as the choice to use is also for a lifetime, however long that life lasts."

2020-09-29 15:38,"Four out of five people in the US who try heroin today started with prescription painkillers, according to the American Society of Addiction Medicine. Alarmingly, street heroin started being secretly cut with the dangerous synthetic opioid fentanyl.

By misleading physicians about the safety of OxyContin in order to earn $35bn in sales revenue from the toxic pain drug between 1995 and 2015, addiction specialists say that Purdue Pharma owners, the Sackler family, bear the lion’s share of the responsibility for many deaths and today's opioid crisis. It was marketed to physicians, many of whom were taken on lavish junkets, given misleading information and paid to give talks on the drug . Patients were wrongly told the pills were a reliable long-term solution to chronic pain, and in some cases offered coupons for a month’s free sample. DEA data says that the US has been flooded with about 10 billion pain pills a year. DEA data has also shown that pill mill clinics were excellent OxyContin customers for the Sacklers/Purdue Pharma. 

The opioid epidemic is now burgeoning in the U.S. with millions of smashed up lives, individuals, families. Sacklers/Purdue Pharma seek to avoid legal responsibility and retreat back into their money and vast profiteering, preferring to let other people clean up and pay for the overall and inevitable long-term suffering, death and destruction they created."

Drug policy in the United States of America is irrational, immoral, counterproductive, evil, and unconstitutional.

Until we have a national drug policy that is: rational, moral, productive, good, and constitutional; we will continue to have people dying from opioid/opiate drugs or other drugs less deadly than tobacco or alcohol.

To achieve this goal, we must take one of two paths; either:

1) tobacco, alcohol, coffee, and cannabis must be classified & regulated as the schedule I, II, V, and V (not I) controlled substances these drugs are, by definition, in the Controlled Substances Act (CSA);

or

2) the CSA must be repealed and the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) must be abolished.

At its peak I was taking 5 pills/day. They started okay, masking the pain, but their efficacy wanes, then you need more. I was getting increasingly wiggy, so I decided to start tapering. 

I probably tapered too fast--at least initially--but I understand now how absolutely brutal this drug can be. It took me three months to be free of them, and some of those days were the worst in my life: weeping, borderline suicidal, feeling like I'm buried alive, breathing breathing breathing. If it wasn't for COVID, I would have admitted myself to a hospital. 

I can understand how badly one needs relief from the symptoms. Contrary to some reports I've hear, I never felt euphoric--just a sense that the pain was distant. It was the withdrawals that were so horrific.

I don't see how throwing lots of money at the problem makes it magically go away. especially with so many with inside knowledge telling us the cravings never really disappear. and with some substances, you're never really quite the same when those neurotransmitters are scrambled to anticipate the relief from your drug of choice. relative anhedonia- sober and clean, but never quite as happy as they once were. the world of color becomes replaced with black and white, gray everywhere. the sunshine never really manages to emerge again. 
what other Western society deals with this though? we are clearly a sick society in need of intensive care. 
but there's no money to deal with the issue of substance abuse. we're broke, governments at all levels from local to state, county to federal, are straining under lack of normal tax receipts due to Covid and other ills. Trump slashed the corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% while lots of companies are reporting record profits, despite or rather because of the pandemic.

2020-09-30 0:38,"Some unpopular ""truths"" on opioids, and a personal opinion (apologies for simplifications & omissions):
1. Opioids are not pleasure drugs, like alcohol, marijuana or cocaine, but medicines. Most people who experience  overwhelming opioid euphoria (very few people) might suffer from derangements in their endogenous opioid system, and use them as self-medication. 
2. Other people are attracted by the very idea of ""doing drugs"" - a psychological and sociological problem. 
3. Opioids are a quick way to put one's problems at a distance. But dependence is quite easy, and difficult to face if one doesn't know what he's doing. 
4. Under these aspects, opioids are not too different from benzodiazepines (Valium, Xanax, etc.). Dependence is quite the same, and benz. are probably more mentally impairing in the long time than opioids. But they are socially accepted, a BIG difference.
4. Pharmaceutical opioids are very safe drugs, ""surprisingly nontoxic even when used in substantial daily doses for many years"" (Cecil Txtbk of Medicine, 1996, p.52).  Countless eminent people used opioids for decades without physical or mental impairment. 
4. I am absolutely convinced that people who ""need"" opioids for their well-being should be allowed to use them (ideally under medical supervision). 
The current opioid epidemic (with all the avoidable deaths from illegal drugs, including fentanyl derivatives) is the product of pain, social discomfort, despair, loneliness, inability to cope, and ignorance."

2020-10-01 15:03,"This article and likely the research on which it reports share a major, unquestioned assumption: that a ""conspiracy"" can be identified as verifiably false and thus subject to correlation with some personality types. In fact, others who have studied conspiracies recognize that the word itself is often weaponized to discredit certain theories that are disliked by some party. If you are a secret access program such as AATIP which the NYT revealed in 2017 as the US Government's agency that studies on UFOs or any other SAP of the DoD, you have a strong vested interest in discrediting theories that reveal your work. Furthermore, such theories may and probably often do have some aspects which are true and thus a theory cannot be categorically be declared false. Often such theories requires outside-the-box thinking and can be based on sources of evidence that some call into question. One person might consider UFO cover-ups as conspiracy because they refuse to believe UFOs no matter what or they have not examined the evidence because their biases prevent them from doing so. Also conspiracies can be based on true facts that lead to a false narrative or a relatively true narrative can be based on false facts. Unfortunately the study authors likely ignored these nuances so that they could create their analysis. But if some conspiracies do have some truth but are hard to verify, then that casts a large shadow over the validity of this theory of conspiracy theories."
2020-10-01 14:31,"It's hard not to comment on the irony that these believers in the wildest fantasies can't see the actual conspiracies that rule our national lives.

2020-10-01 15:33,"“The study included participants recruited both online and in-person, at Emory. About 60 percent scored low on the scales, meaning they were resistant to such theories; the other 40 percent ranged above average or higher.”

If 60% scored low and 40% were above average or higher, how many were average? What does “average” even mean then?

“In time, perhaps some scientist or therapist will try to slap a diagnosis on believers in Big Lie conspiracies that seem wildly out of line with reality.”

Maybe it is not a personality disorder at all, just simple stupidity - a lack of basic judgment and critical thinking skills. Maybe most conspiracy theorists are people that have not learned to value reason over emotional self-gratification. Maybe their reasoning skills do not include the ability to evaluate arguments and propositions, to differentiate normative and positive statements, to separate fact from opinion, to consider and qualify sources, or to be able to admit a mistake and change an opinion when presented with better evidence.

People who believe ideas others label as conspiracy theories should take a second look at their beliefs to decide if the beliefs result not from truth but from a strong need for emotional self-gratification, stupidity and faulty reasoning, a schizotypal personality disorder, or full-blown psychosis."
2020-10-01 15:33,"If one of the signs for susceptibility to conspiracies is magical thinking, faith in a religion, be it Christianity, Islam, Buddism or any of the New Age beliefs, makes one vulnerable.

Modern men who eschew magical thinking for the wonders of today's cutting edge science are often not equipped to handle it safely.  The earth is littered with nuclear waste from the atomic age, carbon dioxide from the industrial age,  and is now facing  hazards from gene splicing and blithely sending satellites into space.

2020-10-01 14:40,There are two types of conspiracy theories. 1. those that get started without a shred of evidence. 2. Those that start with some to an overwhelming amount of evidence. Pizzagate is in the first category. There is not one shred of evidence of a cannibalistic pedophile ring being run out of a pizza place yet there are more than a few who believe it. The Trump campaign colluding with Russia to win the 2016 election and continuing to seek outside help in this election - Ukraine - is in category number two. There is more than an overwhelming amount of evidence in plain view but it's reduced to a conspiracy because of the president obstructing justice using the DoJ and dangling pardons for those who don't 'rat him out.'

2020-10-01 17:15,"I am a retired engineer.  Because of denial of AGW and the GOP's response to the mere presence of an African-American President (I was a registered Republican for 30 years), I decided to study for myself why conservatives think the way they do.  There had to be a root cause.  I made a list of conservative traits (belief in conspiracy theories was one) including their ideology and looked for a common denominator.  It was clear that every one of their traits aligned with symptoms of paranoia.  That is not to say they are paranoid, I cannot make that claim.  I just connected the dots.  The most common symptom seems to be the sense that everyone is out to get you.  We all inherited fear from evolution.  It is on a continuum and the more you have, the further right on the pollical spectrum until you reach a point where healthy fear begins to resemble symptoms of paranoia.  Recall the bumper sticker: ""If you don’t think someone is plotting against you, you’re not paying attention.""   Also, ""being on guard for hidden plots was likely a matter of personal survival"".  This is obviously from evolution which means we are predisposed to unconscious, automatic ""thinking"".  Using MRI, scientists from University College London have found that students who identify themselves as conservatives have a larger amygdala than self-described liberals.  The right amygdala is considered by some to be evolutionarily primative which means we can survive in today's world without it.  Simple isn't it?"

I witnessed many occasions where the CEO of a government agency actively sought to misdirect the citizen oversight committee and was generally successful. To think this doesn't happen on a regular basis among any number of organizations is naïve in the extreme.

Second, it should be abundantly clear that, should a powerful set of individuals wish to conspire to affect a large-scale action, anyone that questions the official story is instantly suspected of being paranoid or psychotic. This is a very powerful weapon for the conspiring individuals that can be used to misdirect any legitimate investigation.

Lastly, questioning any part of an official story, without necessarily attributing the action to any individual or group without foundation, is completely rational and intellectually required."
2020-10-01 17:41,"I personally don't care for them but many people use or look to conspiracy theories to make sense of events they do not understand. It is always healthy to be suspicious of powerful, high profile people but not to the point where they're used as an ideology or become tantamount to a religious belief. At the same time, it is also not healthy to write off or ridicule events or accusations as a ""conspiracy theory"" when the evidence for them is clear and grounded in fact.

Conspiracy theories should also not be banned or restricted and neither should the personalities (like Alex Jones) who use or conjure them up. The best way to refute conspiracy theories or undermine their credibility is to keep them out in the open. To somehow ""cancel"" them out will only make them more popular since their prohibition will only garner sympathy from others and confirm to subscribers their (albeit irrational) hypothesis is correct."

I have spent a lot of time reflecting on how an intelligent and educated person could believe the cannibal pedophile screed.   We were both raised in an extreme religion that denies the reality of illness and believes  your thought can control the world around you.   I believe this childhood indoctrination on refusing to accept what is before your eyes (illness, disease) has resulted in his susceptibility and willingness to ignore what most of us would see as reality.   I guess my point is that upbringing plays a role in who gravitates towards outlandish conspiracy theories.   Personality no doubt plays a role, since I was raised in the same religion and yet am grounded In reality, or at least I search for sources of credible information.   One more point, sometimes paranoids do have enemies.   So for example, who would imagine some of the corporate pollution released into the ground or water  knowingly “reliable” institutions?   If I had told you this was happening in the 50’s, you likely would have thought I was a nut, and yet the facts slowly came out in places like Love Canal.

If asked to put out fire it was my job to know how to put it out.   Social science has yet to advance to the point where they can make specific predictions about what course of action to take.   Social science doesn't really have an agreed upon theory of human nature.   We engineers had Newton.  Social science has yet to produce their Newton.  In this specific case, social science doesn't have an information theory so they can't really say who is paranoid delusional and who is not.  If you were to poll social science and ask if belief in Jesus is a conspiracy theory or paranoid delusion you would get booted from their quorum.  We should see  on the front page of the NYT a cornucopia of recommendations on how to improve the internet to safeguard our information,  how to hold politicians accountabe for their claims, how to restructure government to prevent global warming denial etc.  It's the complete absence of an effective response to our current political crisis from social science which is the key issue.

Secondly, their lack of professionalism which utilizes an ignorant stereotype of mentally ill people, could affect how the general public views the psychology profession in general.

2020-10-01 19:05,"For 50+ years, I debated conspiracy adherents.  Many years ago I wrote an article to summarize what  I learned from that experience.  My basic conclusion was:

""The entire purpose of most political conspiracy theories is NOT to carefully present evidence and then use reason and logic to arrive at sound, verifiable conclusions.  Instead, most political conspiracy theories are primarily an intellectual device by which individuals and organizations identify and demonize their perceived enemies whom they propose to vanquish...The substantive content of a political conspiracy theory is often completely irrelevant to the underlying purpose of the theory and, in any event, there is no possible way to refute or disprove most such theories to the satisfaction of its authors or adherents because most political conspiracy theories are constructed to be self-sealing so that contradictory data can be instantly dismissed, ignored, or de-valued.  The reason is because the theory functions as a problem-solving device but the actual “problem” has virtually nothing to do with the details regarding people and events which are part of the conspiratorial narrative...The actual “problem” which political conspiracy theories seek to address is explaining one’s sense of impotence---i.e. providing plausible reasons for why one’s values, ideas, policy preferences, and political candidates seem to be repeatedly ignored, disparaged, violated, or defeated – particularly over long periods of time."""

Trump supports Putin and asserts that China is the national security threat (as in TikTok).

<a href=""https://www.pbs.org/show/hacking-your-mind"" target=""_blank"">https://www.pbs.org/show/hacking-your-mind</a>/
I don't think the key to understanding lays so much on identifying a ""personality type"" as it does in underatnding how ANYBODY's (looking at you, ""experts"" who have studied this all your lives) mind can be influenced at unconscious levels from subtle social cues, targeted disinformation campaigns, peer pressure, and general environmental factors during your brain's development (which is not just your childhood, but most of your life).
The series shows several interesting experiments in which people are socially influenced regardless of their level of education ethnicity and background, even if they have made a career out of identifiying and combatting propaganda themselves. They too are just as sucsceptible as anyone else, it turns out.
It's not your fault - it's due to the structure of the brain and the evolutionary forces that shaped our consciousness that the mind is so easily influenced - as the experiments show - human minds are easier to influence than a dog or monkey's mind.
Especially episode 3, which deals with disinformation and politics, and episode 4, which shows how the same techniques that are used to hack your mind can be used to improve your life"

Similarly, it seems to be the case that less viral load is better than more. I really do not think you need a PHD to understand this. And if a mask can somewhat reduce viral load uptake, well perhaps people exposed will have asymptomatic or mild cases, rather than severe, especially among at risk groups.  So maybe we assign an additional 3% or 3000 people per 100k. 
What the actual percentages are, will not be known for some time. But common sense would seem to indicate that even a 5-10% reduction in transmission or severe infection is a big win from a national healthcare perspective. 
We have few tools so far to fight this virus. Is it really that big an ask for people to wear masks? Why politicize this? Or bring in conspiracy theories.

Over the weekend the New York Times ran an article about how a man recently died from eating too much licorice. The article stated that excessive licorice consumption can lead to fatally low levels of potassium in the human body.

That's fine, but the article also mentioned that the man in question had a poor diet, smoked a pack of cigarettes each day, and had a history of heroin use. While the fatality's proximate cause might have been the excessive licorice consumption, there were what the medical establishment would call ""comorbidities.""

In many cases reported in the news media of Covid-19 deaths, Covid-19 may have been the proximate cause. But the news media could do better to emphasize the comorbitity aspect of the pandemic. Much of the public understands that only a small number of human beings die solely because of Covid-19. For the average person under the age of 75, the chance of dying from Covid-19, and Covid-19 alone, is near zero. The failure to report this accurately is part of what is leading to skepticism about the disease among the general public."
2020-09-28 18:51,"Yes, there are more cases and growing skepticism, why?

The simple answer is the way policy has responded to science.

The virus is no hoax and it has contributed to the death of nearly a million people globally. But while science was trying to figure out how this virus functioned, policymakers were much too quick to assume that early reports were definitive.

When science discovered that many of those early assumptions were incomplete or wrong, our political leaders simply dug in their heels and compounded early mistakes with censorship.

There is no shortage of front line doctors and medical scientists who have pointed to:
A) better diagnostic methods than the current PCR,
B) more effective treatment methods,
C) better means of counting cases,
D) better means of establishing the infection fatality rate,
E) readily available and much less expensive treatments than mass vaccination.

And the list could go on. But instead, our policymakers have wrecked the world economy, have offered no plan for repairing it, have undermined our children's education, and have significantly curtailed our civil liberties.

Yet, the average citizen can see that other nations have done more, with less and more effectively.

Hoax is the wrong word to describe what's going on. But willful incompetence fits, as does ridged orthodoxy, lack of flexibility, unwillingness to listen, and disregard for our general wellbeing.

I believe if you fee ill and test positive for C 19 then you have it.  But if you take a test and feel fine and it comes back positive, I don't believe you have it.

Because people who have legitimate questions about masks (yes, the virus IS much smaller than bacteria for which the masks were made), or about how governments have gone about dealing with Covid-19, or who are deeply concerned about the rush for an mRNA vaccine which has never worked for previous coronaviruses -- all of these people are lumped together with QAnon, which is an embarrassment to human intelligence and sanity. 
Suddenly it's become verboten to question authority on many levels. And that includes 5G -- no, it's not the cause of the virus, no one is saying that. But how about the studies showing it's many orders of magnitude more destructive to human health than 4G? Are we supposed to be sheep passively swallowing  whatever is put in front of us?

We can nash our teeth all we want about how selfish and immoral people are, we can try to shame people, but people are who they are. 

I hope vaccines and/or good treatments are around the corner because if they’re not and the one proposed solution is repeated lockdowns and indefinite social distancing, that’s not going to happen. People will give up and take the alternative, as awful as it is. I mean, increasingly many are giving up already.

We were told that we had to make these terrible sacrifices in order to ""bend the curve"" of hospital admissions  and deaths. And that happened. But still we hear about more lockdowns. It seems like unelected ""health officials"" and experts rule our lives, intimately.

Extreme right parties are spreading conspiracy theories, especially that of Marine Le Pen and like-minded groups, who want the European Union to dissolve and let racism reign. 

They are in the minority.  But lazy people frustrated by masks and lockdowns--whiners--become unwitting soldiers for the far right, claiming hoax.

Now it seems obvious that China will be much stronger relative to the West next year. And the Western governments can blame no one else but themselves: after all, they did have 3 month warning before the virus reached their countries in large numbers. They did have role models on how to respond to the virus effectively and efficiently without hurting too much their economies with Korea, Taiwan and others. They did have all the scientific and technical expertise to tackle the epidemic. They failed. Some more so than others, I guess everybody here knows which administration failed most of all - and is actually still failing.

However, China should also take responsibility for allowing COVID to escape from its wildlife markets.  This is not the first time a virus has come out China's wildlife markets and then spread to other countries.  A million people have died now worldwide of COVID.  If China was irresponsible in allowing COVID to spread through its wildlife markets, then the praise we give China for having contained COVID within its own borders should be tempered with some criticism for allowing the virus to spread beyond bats and the wild animals they infect."

However, visiting China, the “communist dictatorship” bogeyman, was not one of the latter.

The family have found people in China to be kind to us, cordial to one another, curious about the world, energetic and industrious, and in one important aspect very different than in the US: their government officials can be independent of mind and humane on a personal level.

On one of the family’s internal flights, my 8 year-old daughter forgot to pack her favorite toy scotch tape and scissors in checked-in luggage. At the security gate, the official demanded she hand over the scissors. My kid’s innocent eyes teared up, and the security guy just stopped, gestured to wait, and went to talk to some higher up. He came back with a smile and waved that she can keep the scissors. My kiddo was clearly happy and the flight went on without incident.

Humanity, initiative, balance and proportionality are qualities that should be uniformly found in government officials that hold so much power on regular people, but how many can say that about our experiences with the TSA or any other US government officials or local police?

A) America has become anti-science. Trumpists de-fund research. Trumpists ignore/ridicule scientific findings. Fewer new, exploitable technologies will enter the economic pipeline.

(Health, disability and life insurers have long shared information about individuals’ prior claims. Any right to privacy is typically waived in the insurance application forms). 

At the very time that the health of the country requires those who are sick to get prompt treatment, we are creating strong disincentives for millions of people whose future insurability will be in jeopardy. Failure to seek early treatment will result in more serious illness at emergency rooms and inaccurately low infection counts in the hands of public health officials. 

It would be useful to know how many sick people are already avoiding treatment, as this phenomenon is only bound to grow in the face of future threats to the availability of medical insurance.

There just is not reason that we cannot have an equitable system of coverage for all.  We spend more per capita than any other country, yet our outcomes rank lower than the top 20 nations in nearly all population metrics.  Money is not the reason that we don’t have universal care.  Exclusionary politics is at the root of the problem just as it is with most of the issues that face us today.  We are a nation of exclusives not inclusive."
2020-09-28 14:56,"Perhaps they can try to work for Biden/Harris for President/Veep, or for state and local officials who support the ACA and Medicaid expansion.   Might help them, and people like them, in the long run but actually also in the short term."
2020-09-28 15:01,"Before Obamacare, there were viable individual insurance markets.  The federal portability act meant that people could get community rating if they had been continuously covered, not health rated.

Today, they can get ObamaCare policies.  Once the program is cancelled, after a one year delay, they will be able to get individual policies as the market is re-established."
2020-09-28 15:11,"Obamacare subsidy limits premiums to 9.5% of your income if your income is modest ($50K single, $103K family). But paying up to 13% of your take home pay for premiums is a burden for most in this income range.

And Obamacare could disappear by 2023 with new Supreme Court makeup, assuming a negative decision in June 2021."
2020-09-28 15:27,"This is greeeeeeeeat news!  As a union member for 40 years, I actually knew the cost and paid for my medical insurance every week.  The price tag was $18,000 for the full run of benefits- major medical, dental, eye and prescription medicine.  When the ACA, Obama care, came about I was thrilled even as it began to cost me and my fairly well compensated fellow union member more. Yet surprisingly, I read all the dissent from people who made considerably less and had little or no medical coverage and I couldn’t understand their reasoning.  Another case for poll tests to weed out the lazy voters unwilling to educate themselves before pulling the lever- they can always sell their kids for medical experiments."
2020-09-28 15:30,"The need for universal coverage is starkly evidenced by people losing jobs and health insurance. But at this point universal coverage cannot be achieved by legislative enactment of some perfect solution. We must continue to rely upon group insurance as is offered by employers, for now. Over time needed to make a rational conversion without interrupting health care, we should retain what serves our needs."
2020-09-28 15:30,"By tying Health Care to employment, it enables companies to keep wages down and keep employees who might otherwise leave. 

If the penalty for going without health insurance is poverty or worse, it gives those companies more leverage over employees....especially unionized companies. 

It’s sad that working class people don’t see this and actively cheer as Obamacare is whittled away."
2020-09-28 15:43,"It is time to do away with employer-provided coverage. Simple as that. And do away with the ridiculous ""open enrollment"" period concept. 

Either go for universal care or a completely market-based approach - where the government will provide insurance to anyone who can't afford it in the market: every single citizen should have health insurance in some form. 

What if the 10 largest employers in America said they were no longer offering employer-based health insurance because it is an unsustainable system and they were referring their employees to the exchanges. And would cover their costs for the first year or two or three during the transition period - and increase their salary based on 25-50% of the companies average costs per person to provide employer-based insurance.

IOW accelerate the ACA's healthcare exchanges potential. 

And if the health insurance companies - expand the market, allow companies like USAA to compete - have to truly compete for our business directly in the market and not through employers they will have to compete on things like price, service, coverage and transparency. 

It won't be perfect - no healthcare system will ever be perfect - but it will be a clear improvement 

The problem CAN be solved - if we have the determination to roll up our sleeves, collaborate, work hard and make hard choices."
2020-09-28 15:44,"It is baffling that the focus seems to be on boosting unemployment benefits with cash payments of highly debated amounts while I have not seen anyone promote fully subsidized COBRA (extending employer-based coverage) premiums for those who are eligible.

This combination - extra cash but not COBRA - has the perverse effect of creating a far bigger short term work incentive for those with health problems or dependents than for those with neither. This is exactly the opposite of what we, as a society, should want to happen."
2020-09-28 15:51,"One of the biggest arguments for Medicare for All is that it will help small businesses tremendously by taking away the obligation that they provide health insurance to their employees.

It’s an argument the corporate lobbyists on the right would rather not make, and the bleeding hearts on the left don’t care about.  But it’s hugely important."
2020-09-28 16:10,"Biden/Harris can make a simple statement: We thought that the Affordable Care Act would be enough but it is clearly unable to cope with this massive public health emergency. It is time to give up on half measures and implement a simple comprehensive national health insurance system. 

Unfortunately the behavior of health insurers has demonstrated that they are not part of the solution. Medicare for All."
2020-09-28 16:18,"If you are laid off, you likely qualify for Medicaid, even if collecting unemployment.  The qualification is based on monthly income now, not annual estimates or previous years.  The extra $600 is not a part of the calculation (i.e. not considered income).

So, I'm not sure who is impacted and gets no coverage."
2020-09-28 16:30,"All this makes me wonder why MOST business owners, especially those with fewer than 200 employees, don't support Single Payer. They'd pay less in taxes than they do in premiums, and if their business was closed and not making income, they wouldn't pay those taxes, yet their workers would still get medical coverage.

Why is there such a disconnect?"
2020-09-28 16:55,"I've never understood why employers, particularly large corporations with clout, are not clamoring to get health insurance off their backs.

With national insurance they could theoretically send one check to the Feds annually, perhaps based on headcount.  

No more annual open enrollment.  No more analyses weighing options and premium increases and insurer comparisons."
2020-09-28 16:57,"We need to put the final nail in the coffin for health insurance being tied to employment. Single payer systems work- the data shows that. And if you don’t believe the data, just look at who doesn’t want single payer health insurance in the US. The health insurance companies that will no longer have an oligopoly, large/low wage employers who can’t compel people to stay by hanging their family’s health over their heads and politicians who get donations from both of those groups."

Perhaps republicans can be shunned for the next 2 decades like they were after destroying the economy in the Great Depression."
2020-09-28 14:38,And just wait for Trump’s new Supreme Court to axe the ACA - and we’ll return to insurance where you or your loved ones can be denied coverage for pre-existing conditions. Trump’s $750 tax payment won’t help you!
2020-09-28 15:48,"Pathetic, pathetic that our country has not yet made life easier for the people featured in the article, and we're likely to go far backwards now with a gone ACA.

Even with the ACA, only 91% ""insured, with other problems of unaffordable copays. (1%-2% of people don't have coverage due to the 12 red states not expanding Medicaid.  Much of the rest of the gap is due to genuine unaffordability.  I calculated last year certain cases of people needing to pay 40% of income for premiums plus max out of pocket.)

Further, some of the 91% insured really don't have insurance (only a loan for medical expenses payable by their estates--I refer to people in 10-14 states like MD, NJ, MA with ACA expanded Medicaid or other Medicaids who are 55 or older).  This happens under Medicaid estate recovery laws in those states, defeating with the ACA's promise.

(If unfamiliar with the last issue, see the Wikipedia article on Medicaid estate recovery for many details.  Wikipedia is not reliable in itself--you will need to trace the references to verify.)

The ACA needs fixing.  The Republicans have prevented it.

The last Krugman column actually points to a sketch of Biden's plan to patch, in a substantial way, the ACA,  <a href=""https://www.healthcaredive.com/news/5-key-pillars-of-bidens-healthcare-plan/576656"" target=""_blank"">https://www.healthcaredive.com/news/5-key-pillars-of-bidens-healthcare-plan/576656</a>/ 

It seems, to me, to fix many (but not all) of the problems, in particular, by capping what ANY family has to pay for health insurance at 8.5% of income.  (Doing away with the ""subsidy cliff."")"

Likewise in a job market where a College Education is (as a general rule) the difference between success and poverty combined with the ability for young people barely into adulthood to borrow obscene amounts of money to acquire a degree provides no natural limits on cost.

The true financial devastation will start appearing when the government gives the okay to businesses to open again and there are significantly less left to open. Too many could not survive the shut down. Then, millions of displaced workers are out of money, health insurance and they drain unemployment benefits, which in turn causes more business closures and yet further unemployment. Once the benefits and federal aid money dries up, the rest of the discretionary-income-dependent businesses go bankrupt. Inflation becomes rampant, families end up homeless, no one can afford to medical treatment, banks go under, abandoned homes are everywhere with delinquent mortgages attached.  No one can get a loan or afford to purchase a home.

2020-09-28 16:45,"In addition to the many fine comments here about the uniquely American madness of linking health insurance to (highly volatile) employment, it's worth noting that this foolish, antiquated policy is utterly destroying US competitiveness and the entrepreneurial spirit that have long defined us. 

I've worked and conferenced in dozens of countries over my many years as an engineer and professor, and the USA is facing a dreadful competitive disadvantage compared to countries with universal healthcare. Their businesses have much less overhead and are better able to compete with American exporters on both price and quality. Their workers are healthier and less stressed, and able to be more productive. (Despite the US reputation for long hours, our productivity has plunged and we're now trailing most of our developed peers.) Their companies are less reluctant to take a chance and hire people, including older experienced workers who can inject vital knowhow, since they need not worry about shouldering healthcare costs themselves. (Again, the USA's labor force participation--a measure of real unemployment--lags badly behind our peers.) Their finances are better since national healthcare is much cheaper.

And they're more entrepreneurial and flexible than Americans since their most driven, ambitious citizens need not worry about the drag of losing health insurance. More skilled Americans are emigrating abroad in part because of this, especially those starting families and businesses."
2020-09-28 17:47,"Hot off the press from Kaiser Family Foundation: 

1)analysis of Biden's plan to help affordability (finding it helps quite a bit)

2)Plus a wonderful interactive tool to explore cost post-subsidy of premiums currently, by state, age, and income.

It's here:

<a href=""https://www.kff.org/health-reform/issue-brief/affordability-in-the-aca-marketplace-under-a-proposal-like-joe-bidens-health-plan"" target=""_blank"">https://www.kff.org/health-reform/issue-brief/affordability-in-the-aca-marketplace-under-a-proposal-like-joe-bidens-health-plan</a>/

If you can go to that interactive table, you can see that there is currently a serious problem for many people with premiums, particularly those just over the 400% of Federal Poverty Level ""subsidy cliff"".

That table gives very easy access to what I frequently have quoted, that I was seeing common cases last year where some people would be at 40% of income for premium plus out of pocket max.

(I also occasionally mention here, as I have attempted to post below, that I had placed those rates in a ""Problems"" section of the Wikipedia ACA article, and a single editor exercised a veto-option to get those numbers out.  (Later, a second editor came along, and by two to one voting, pulled the whole section out.)

i encourage people to go the the Kaiser interactive table, and experiment,  and see those high rates for SOME people.  (Other people are treated very sweetly by the current ACA. It depends on income, age, and state.)

The purpose of America's health insurance business is to make a profit, and that means means, perfecting the art of refusing to provide health care.
This is America, with its religion of Capitalism and its god, Profit.
America's healthcare spending is nearly double that of other wealthy country, and with worse results. 

If the NYT and other Establishment media portrayed medicare for all objectively, and were not hysterical about the problems relating to transition, medicare for all would happen. The majority of The People want medicare for all.

""... a single-payer, universal health-care system is likely to lead to a 13% savings in national health-care expenditure, equivalent to more than US$450 billion annually (based on the value of the US$ in 2017). The entire system could be funded with less financial outlay than is incurred by employers and households paying for health-care premiums combined with existing government allocations.""

Instead, the voices for opening bars, theme parks, and churches are much louder. In India, rich people can simply hire private tutors to educate their children while families who aren't rich have to send their children to pick garbage in dumps. 

I've seen Dickensian-style comments in the Times by readers who think US children should be sent to work while schools are closed during the pandemic.

So the goal post keeps moving and costs keep rising and if it is a small business with insufficient resources will give up. If it is a large pharma it can absorb losses and dance to the F.D.A.'s directions and keep their milestones. Luckily for big pharma, uncle Sam is pouring money into big pharma and doing everything to satisfy the whims and fancies of the F.D.A. As far as how long it will take for the F.D.A. to approve anything new, there is no urgency of now. It will take its own sweet time, it is a large bureaucratic organization that does very little of its own bench research.

With all the money that tax payers have invested for decades, it would have been better if it was the F.D.A. that ran the tests and trials did the due diligence and the leg work to determine if something is safe and effective to administer. This way the responsibility would be that of F.D.A.to do the real work and bear all the costs of those seeking an approval of their product. If the president and Americans are frustrated by F.D.A.

Each time such reopenings and easing occur -- almost immediately infection and death rates spike once again leading to calls for new shutdowns.

As but one example, why would they start playing Pac-12 and Big Ten football games again when contagions are raging on college campuses?

Does this make any sense whatsoever?

We seem simply incapable of learning that dealing effectively with  this pandemic demands that we alter our expectations and lifestyles for an extended period of time.

This is nonsense.  Air cleaners that provide six air exchanges per hour cost over $500. The low cost units are designed for home use, not for rooms with a significant number of people in them, so one or two air exchanges per hour is not adequate.  The Coway Airmega 200 from the wirecutter article has a CADR (Clean Air Delivery Rate) of around 240, which is enough for a 15""x16"" room with 10"" ceilings that are typical of classrooms.  My classroom is about four times that size and I have an air cleaner with a CADR of 950.  It did not cost less than $200.  A good rule of thumb for classrooms is that the CADR should equal the number of square feet in the floor area.  For larger classrooms it may make sense to have multiple smaller units around the edges of the classroom.  The Coway units are selling for $250 these days if you can find them. Most classrooms will need 2-4 depending on the size.   I own one of the Coway units for home and when it is running full speed (CADR of 240) it is pretty loud.

2020-09-24 19:26,"Hair IS crucial for your self-esteem tho.

About 40% of women have hair loss. The only real solutions are monoxidil (which leaves your remaining hair greasy constantly) and very pricey laser caps/treatments. For men, there's prescription medication, which actually works, but women--who experience hair loss just as often--are left in the cold. 

I have genetic hair loss. It started when I was in my 20s. By 28, it was noticeable. Now, at 50, if I don't wear a hat every second I step outside--summer and winter--my scalp gets sunburned. I've lost about 2/3 of my hair volume. I had gorgeous hair.

At first, it had horrible impact on my self-esteem. TBH, it still does. I don't permit anyone to touch my hair. For years, I wouldn't wear it out long, bc it looked so bad. Men are socially permitted to be bald, or shave their heads. WOMEN ARE NOT. To have once had beautiful hair and to lose it is incalculable. The only thing I mourned as much as losing my hair was when a family member died. 

Yes, it DID impact my health. Unhappy people are not healthy. When you can't stand to pass a mirror because of the trauma and grief it causes, and that goes on for years and years, it's not a healthy thing.

Eventually I could go another wrap around my hair with a ponytail holder and my scalp is cold in August! Five months after being sick I would say things have stabilized and I am noticing baby hairs along the hair line, so I have hope my head will recover like the rest of my body has.

Now they're about the size of a nickle or quarter. For 25 years, I've had no treatment for the hair loss because it grows back on its own (I did address the root cause of the stress).

I didn't mind the thinning because now the natural wave is more prominent and I can finally pin my hair up in a bun.  I've been trying to tell myself the hair loss looks like a lot because my hair is so long.  But I'm not convinced.  I had a medical trauma that kept me in the hospital for a month earlier this year and sent to a nursing home for another month.  By some miracle I escaped Covid that was rampant in that facility.  I did, however, have radiation treatments throughout July about the time the hair loss ramped up.  I knew about hair loss and chemo but no one said anything about  radiation.  I'll have to run this by my doctor."
2020-09-25 1:50,"Hair loss is a known symptom of beriberi, otherwise known as thiamine deficiency disease. For a while now I have been suggesting that there is a connection between the level of thiamine sufficiency or deficiency in the body and the outcome following COVID infection. If someone has a good level of thiamine, the likely outcome is that they are asymptomatic. If they are somewhat low, after fighting the virus they may end up somewhat deficient. In other words, they could have beriberi. If one compares the symptoms of the so-called COVID long-haulers with those which can result from beriberi, they are the same, including hair loss. Unfortunately this disease has largely been consigned to the past and forgotten about by most of the medical profession, but has now made a return because of a combination of a somewhat more severe virus than usual and a generally poor state of nutrition resulting from the typical western diet. Hopefully, when this is finally recognised, it will result in a more rational, less chaotic response to the pandemic."

It was liberating to replace my brush with a #3 clipper guard and I have not looked back. It's not the solution for every woman, but at 46 I finally feel like my hair--and my head--belong to me. 
That said, my heart reaches out to Mrs. Rowe and all of those dealing with hair loss--I will never forget the despair that pushed me to pick up the clippers in the first place.

2020-09-25 12:15,"In my 40 years of critical care practice I saw many cases of sometimes striking hair loss after severe trauma or illness, even childbirth. In these cases the hair does come out in clumps abruptly but grows back with recovery.  Usually the hair loss occurs about 1 month after the “shock” to the system.  Very often the hair grows back in, although it of course it takes a while.

The mechanism is thought to be a growth arrest at the hair follicle which produces a weakened segment at the base of each strand of hair and it breaks off with brushing.
Rather than go through expensive work-ups etc. I usually reassured the patient to be patient and look for signs of new short hair. The reappearance of (short! )hair was a reassuring
sign. The more severe and prolonged the critical illness, the worse the hair loss.  Good nutrition is essential to recovery. 

I hope many who are understandably distressed by sudden hair loss after severe illness will eventually see it return as thick as ever and will notice new hair growth soon.

This not to be construed as medical advice, simply a personal observation.  Any distressing or unusual sign or symptom should be managed by an expert physician."

At the same time, my lifelong acne went berserk, which makes me wonder if I am now immunocompromised  since I can't throw off the  chronic P.acnes bacteria since I was 12 and am now 64, and I am still losing my hair. 
There is so much yet to be learned about the effects of this illness, as they continue to unfold.  
What works best for hair loss ? As my doctor said -""Resignation""
The"
2020-09-25 13:46,"Just before  I turned 40 my hair started falling out -- just out of the blue.  Was diagnosed with Alopecia.  The next few months were stressful, not knowing whether I'd just have a few patches or whether it would all fall out.  Within 2 months it was 90% gone. But I had a job, 2 kids, and had to get on with my life.  So I found some wonderful wig makers, cried for a week or two, and got on with my life.  I year later, and after rounds of painful scalp injections my hair came back but it was never quite the same.  But within a year it fell out again and haven't had luck with anything since.  New treatments cost 10K per month and insurance won't cover.  So, I just continue with the wigs.  Which --honestly -- look great and are undetectible.  I read this article re covid hair loss with interest as I understand the emotional toll it takes, particularly on women.  But wigs these days are fantastic -- get one and get your life back until your hair comes back.  Hang in there!  Its awful but it gets better"
2020-09-25 13:56,"My pandemic-related stress hasn’t caused hair loss (so far), but did cause a nasty shingles outbreak on my face above my eye in April.  (My doctor noted that many cases of shingles occurred in April across the country as a result of the pandemic and shutdown).

As a side note: I take methotrexate to control rheumatoid arthritis.  This immunosuppressant medication is essentially low-dose chemo, so hair loss is a side effect.  Folic acid helps to control the hair loss, though too much folic acid can inhibit the medication’s efficacy."
2020-09-25 14:31,"Amidst the causes of hair loss mentioned in this article, one should examine the medications they have taken, not only specific to Covid-19 but for depression, infections, etc. 

I took a strong dose of a common over the counter NSAID for pain after a fall. It was within the dosage recommended on the label. A significant amount of hair fell out in clumps within hours, never to grow back. I discovered the cause when I searched online for ""medications that can cause rapid hair loss in women."" One may have to search diligently as such 'side effects' may be considered 'rare' and not listed by the pharma company."
2020-09-25 14:54,"Count me in. I looked in the mirror in my bathroom under an overhead light and for the first time in my life, was able to see straight through to my scalp. Previously my hair had been so thick that they would thin it when I got my hair cut. I had noticed a lot more hair in the shower drain and in my hairbrush but didn't snap to how thin my hair was on the top of my scalp until that day.

That was about a month ago and I am now taking a collagen supplement (I was already taking biotin) and extra iron and zinc, using Nioxin shampoo/conditioner and hair treatment, and using a scalp massager, and I am seeing baby hairs starting to grow back in. I'll use Rogaine if I have to, but hopefully it won't be necessary.

Are there bigger problems in the world than hair loss? Absolutely. But as a woman I feel like navigating the world with a near-bald head is going to be a challenge, and right now I am challenged enough. If you're also going through this - empathy."

2020-09-25 14:55,"Thank you all for your comments. Just reading them has made me feel better. I have hereditary hair loss since my late twenties (I am 72). I have dealt with it until recently, when it became worse, to include my eyebrows and lashes. All, I am sure due to numerous stressful events this year. A trip to a dermatologist proved fruitless and frustrating. She treated it, and a facial rash (stress related) as insignificant. There she sat with her thick, wild mane of hair cascading around her face. When I wistfully said I envied her her hair, she  put her head down and went on with her business. Do you think she later reflected on her inability to empathize? I hope so. She had a resident in the room with her. I hope he learned something by witnessing her total lack of empathy. I got more info from reputable medical websites, and more empathy from you all than from her. I will not be returning."
2020-09-25 14:57,I'm a psychiatrist and I've had a handful (10+) of people in the last few months complain about hair loss.  I typically only have about 2 people a year complain about this.
2020-09-25 15:33,"I have news for Dr. Hogan. If my dermatologist ever told me ""Hair is not necessary for your survival, "" I'd find myself a new doctor."
2020-09-25 15:40,"I had thinning hair and it was falling out due to enormous stress of driving in horrific traffic. Yes, we don’t need hair to survive, but as women, hair as they say is our crowning glory, and it is beyond upsetting to start losing it. I was upset all the time. Then I fought back, using good quality biotin vitamins, and Minoxidil, plus vegetables that provide support for health. I regained all my hair. Please don’t suffer, you can regain what you’ve lost, it may take a little time."
2020-09-25 14:36,I find the Trump presidency and the collapse of our democracy WAY more stressful than the pandemic.
2020-09-25 15:08,"STRESS ... everyday, with increasing horror, I have watched the news relating to Covid-19 and have been in ""Lockdown"" for seven months and counting. MY HAIR STARTED FALLING OUT! Horrified by this, and surmising the stress was the culprit, I sent a message to my doctor requesting a referral to a dermatologist. I never heard back. Knowing that we’re in an “ON OUR OWN” initiative in life now, I started researching potential solutions. I bought sulfate-free shampoo, Biotin, Hair vitamins and rejected the “hair growth” products that needed to be used for life, lest one's hair fall out again!  My HAPPY solution: beautiful wigs from a company recommended by WebMD. I am more than pleased and my husband is enchanted and supportive of this “New Me”.  When watching a movie re: Louis XIV,  a period when men wore long curly wigs, the handsome actor, playing the king himself,  visited a garden to mourn the death of his wife, the queen. He removed the long wig while in the company of a gardener. How handsome he looked with short cropped gray hair. It gave me added confidence to know there is NO STIGMA from being truthful about loss of hair, or the fact that one chooses to wear a wig.  Now I can not only make the best of a bad situation, but I can also happily look my best, even better than ever, with ease."
2020-09-25 13:25,"Inexpensive and accessible treatments (and prayer!) worked a small wonder for my alopecia: Niacinimide supplements, OTC prenatal vitamins, vitamin D, and cold pressed Castor oil applied on scalp at night, worked wonders.  

Don't take a regimen of OTC prenatal AND Niacinimide at once because it can cause acne (a side effect of too much vit. B). Instead, choose one or the other.  And no . . . prenatals don't cause weight gain (contains no hormones) --overeating, however, does.

The cherry on top to get fast results: a prescription for Clobetasol, a topical steroid solution.  Miraculous! Bald spot just about gone in 6-8 weeks time.

Good luck and don't fret.  It can be remedied."
2020-09-25 14:26,"I’ve met a few women with alopecia and I can only imagine how hard it must be.  On the other hand, I for one find women with clean shaven bald pates to be kind of an inspiration.  It’s like when Alicia Keys stopped wearing make up. Suddenly the human inside became more visible."
2020-09-25 14:48,This is my post Covid long hauler situation as well. Each time I put my hand to my hair to get it out of the way for example it’s a shock. I’m taking vitamins for hair with D and biotin.  It’s hard to be less stressed when this is stressing you out all the time.  Mine is a literary bent and I think of all the literature where women’s hair was cut off when they had a high fever and even when that was part of the plot like the Holmes story the copper beeches.  For some odd reason that cheers me up.  My literary sisters with a long braid in a drawer.
2020-09-25 15:42,"A Facebook “memory” hit me in the face last night when I realized since January I have lost a considerable amount of hair.

Changing jobs in a pandemic, moving during a pandemic, and hoping my loved ones don’t die from said pandemic might be a factor.

At least I have a historic election and the fate of our democracy to look forward to in a month or so. No stress at all."
2020-09-25 16:05,"Dr. Hogan, I believe the beloved Fleabag put it best: ""Hair is everything.  We wish that it wasn't... but it is.""  

I am guessing the doctor has not experienced hair loss herself, or she would not make such a callous and unsympathetic comment."
2020-09-25 12:09,Look up the nutrient rich foods that can help to promote hair growth and integrate them into your daily routine. Live lightfully and well.
2020-09-25 14:38,"Factor in the hair loss caused by the stress of the current political situation. Millions of Americans wake up every day wondering what else our President has said or done to impact our health, our savings or our safety. Never have a President’s actions so directly impacted the quality of our daily life."
2020-09-25 15:42,"This made me so sad: 

**When she came home from the hairdresser, she said, “my husband was just staring at me. He said, ‘I think I have a different wife.’ **

Wrong thing to say, Bub. Really thoughtless."
2020-09-25 14:42,"and for those of us with textured hair it means much more tangles, because the hair that we lose doesn't just fall out but snags on to the other hair causing us to having to rip out even more as we try to brush/comb through it. From experience,I can tell you that this is a horrible experience!"
2020-09-25 14:04,It's drug side effects. And not the worse one at all.
2020-09-25 12:51,"Sick with the Covid May 20, 17 days until I didnt have a temp. Now it’s Sept. Post Covid breathing problems, blood pressure, achy joints and legs ~ and 6 weeks ago my hair started falling out.  All of it sucks, but the hair loss is contributing to the most emotional trauma, its just so evident and can’t be avoided, every time you comb your hair the sink is full of hair and its a shocking reminder of the trauma the virus caused to my body, which was previously super fit and healthy.  Along with the horrific number of deaths caused by the virus and the ignorance with which it was handled by our incompetent government there are going to be millions of people who survive the virus and need more health care, possibly for many years, than they would have if they hadn’t gotten the virus. There will be long term consequences to this pandemic that have only started being discussed. People who get the virus and continue to suffer after they have “recovered” are called Long Haulers. If a change doesn’t occur in November and we continue having this deranged leadership, all Americans will be Long Haulers, virus or not."
2020-09-25 13:59,"STRESS ... everyday, with increasing horror, I have watched the news relating to our current “leader” who has bungled and already destroyed so many institutions, our checks and balances in government, and the safeguards to our health ... including the first line of defense, wearing a mask. MY HAIR STARTED FALLING OUT! Horrified by this, and surmising the stress was the culprit, I sent a message to my doctor requesting a referral to a dermatologist. I never heard back.

2020-09-25 13:38,"Well the media's relentless focus on alarmist and often distorted reporting designed to scare the bezeesus out of people because it generates more clicks might, just miiiight, be adding to people's stress levels LOL. Take the ""news"" with a grain of salt, especially the political distortions it's obsessed with terrifying people with, and you'll reduce your stress by a truckload."
2020-09-25 16:39,"I so appreciate this article. I, too, have come to the conclusion that I am going bald. In addition to a global pandemic and my daily anxieties about my beloved country sliding toward a fascist dictatorship, I have a whole raft of personal stresses. My husband is battling pancreatic cancer, I was forced into retirement at the end of last year due to medical issues and I had major surgery in February. I must be marinating in cortisol. But for all of my adult life, I have lovingly encouraged my male friends who are facing baldness to embrace it rather than fight it or try to hide it; shave your head and revel in the glory of it. I am now going to take my own advise."
2020-09-25 16:49,"I first suffered alopecia aged 11. My teen years were marred by the need for super short hair cuts, huge bald spots and feeling blamed for losing my hair by my parents. No treatment worked, but admittedly my parents didn't ask the doctor to do much. I remember some kind of stinging clear lotion that did nothing. 

 The doctors didn't link my autoimmune Raynaud's with the alopecia, and my eventual celiac diagnosis. I've two large permanent bald spots that I've had since my teens, and thinning. It did partially resolve during pregnancy. It's definitely worse again due to stress. I keep my hair very short and that seems to help.

 Don't give people hope hair will grow in, the stress of that hope is unbelievable. It might not, but it will be ok if it doesnt. As much as I'm sad for my newly balding sisters (and I know it's easy for me to say, as I've had decades to get used to it) but you will adjust even if it's permanent."
2020-09-25 16:49,"This is the second time recently that the Times has uncannily published a piece about a stress-related symptom right as I become aware of it in myself. First it was the article about people cracking their teeth due to stress grinding during the pandemic (I chipped a tooth in March but can't stop grinding). A few weeks ago I noticed overall thinning of my hair. I've not had Covid that I'm aware of and thankfully I've not experienced any personal bereavement. The ambient stress is enough to put people over the edge-- pandemic, the presidential election, and multiple climate disasters (I just spent 10 straight days in my house due to wildfire smoke)."
2020-09-25 16:44,"Thank you Pam Belluck for the 9/24/20 article on Losing Your Hair re: covid.  
I have been experiencing it all.  My thick long hair is now stringy, thin, and my scalp has bare spots galore. My hair strands are everywehere. I have cried, felt depressed and screamed in anguish-- another helpless situation. Yes, I take yoga, mindfulness exercises. So, I collected my hair loss each day for two weeks; got in too see a dermatologist.  I felt she spoke the memorized page from the standard medical book.   Not up-to-dte when the stress from covid. She called in the residing dermatologist-- she ordered more blood tests for vitamin and iron check.  Of course, all normal.  Their recommendation: use Rogaine for men. The excessive hair loss should subside in a year or so. I responded-- ya, by then I will not have any hair.  
I am going to send the link to your article to both dermatologists, thank You. 
~Jo McDowell, subscriber.  thank goodness for the NY Times."
2020-09-25 14:36,I have seen this reported several times as man trying to defect to North Korea. I never even suspected that this would be a possibility. That is a story I want to see reported on. Does this happen often?
2020-09-25 17:22,"This is encouraging, an act of responsibility. And by someone who has been elevated to the world’s stage by Trump and the movie, The Interview, where he plays the not-so-lovable villain, but none the less, a movie star. Now might be the time for him to get rid of the nukes, feed his people, throw off N. Korea’s Chinese shackles, and join the world’s stage in a more positive role."
2020-09-25 15:23,Do you Really think he's Sorry?
2020-09-25 18:45,"There is no evidence that the man tried to defect. The only evidence that the S. Korean government gave were the left flip-flops in the ship (and his real shoes were not found), he was wearing life-vest and floating on an object, that he had some debts and he was divorced, none of the claimed evidences could be a real evidence. North Korea claimed that he didn't defect. So the report that he tried to defect apparently was very ill-based.  The report should be corrected. 

Whether he tried to defect or not, shooting and burning an unarmed civilian is a horrible crime against humanity. Just saying sorry for that means nothing for the victim."
2020-09-24 17:19,"If the government could print goods and services, that would help a lot.   But since they can only print money, this is not really going to help the economy much.   And all the money they print goes straight to the top 10%, who invest it in the stock market and watch their net worth soar.   

Until the virus came along, the wages of service and blue-collar workers were rising, and their share of wage income was going up.   But since March, the professional class who are able to work at their office jobs from home have increased their share of income and wealth.    This is going to create even bigger imbalances in the future."
2020-09-24 17:33,"The responsible policy would be a Keynesian stimulus, but the Republicans and the Friedmanites are against this"
2020-09-24 17:34,"To Ben Casselman and Jeanna Smialek: excellent column!  Very informative!  It raises a question:

What group or individuals are resisting the use of ""fiscal policy""--federal deficit spending--despite obvious need for it in the US right now?

What is the rationale of these groups or individuals for their resistance to needed fiscal stimulus?

Is the Charles Koch political network part of the story?

Koch has extreme anti-government views that he presses on all occasions.  He's never met a government spending program he didn't want to cut--even stimulus spending in times of recession that would grow national wealth, including the wealth of people like him.

Koch's political network wields very large influence in the Republican party.  

Is the Koch political network an obstacle to continued fiscal support for our economy today?  Inquiring minds want to know."
2020-09-24 18:03,"These are not and have not been ""mistakes""; these are parts of GOP strategy to cause damage to  American  cultural and economic structure."
2020-09-24 18:07,"What mistakes? A popular Democrat, Obama, was President and Congress was firmly under Democrat control. Surely without help or advice from Republicans they did everything right."
2020-09-24 18:18,"Our economy is stalled because of the pathetic response to the pandemic. Owing to the lack of any real plan, we’re just drifting rudderless as a Nation, without a plan to face the challenge and use the rebuilding opportunity to improve ourselves.

There have now been approximately 202,000 US covid-19 fatalities with estimates of 60% of them (120,000) due to the President’s dealing with the situation. Think about this. He and his administration are responsible for 120,000 deaths due to their decisions (or lack thereof). We need a front page banner everyday making this clear.

The chaos is only going together worse up to the election with more frantic and shrill threats from the President. Stay the course and vote in November."
2020-09-24 18:20,"When you have the financial sector dictating fiscal and monetary policy you get corporate tax cuts rather than government spending on things like infrastructure to grow the economy.  
What needs to be asked is: Who does the economy serve? 
This story suggests that through tax cuts, interest rates adjustments, layoffs, and fiscal restraint, our economy serves the wealthy."
2020-09-24 18:21,"I’m so tired of this.

The entire premise is wrong.

There is NO SHORTAGE OF CASH FOR BUSINESSES!

Period. I’m an accountant. It is literally my business to understand cash flows. The fact is, the largest US corporations and banks have literally TRILLIONS of dollars in cash and cash equivalents sitting in tax shelters and escrow accounts all over the world.

At ANY moment, they could chose to repatriate those funds to support small businesses and American worker wages. The reason they choose not to do that? They don’t want to pay even $1 in taxes. They’d rather watch the country burn to the ground around them, than pay a few taxes.

They would rather watch the money they control rot away and turn to dust in the vaults of foreign central banks, than use it to help Americans.

And then, they have the gall to demand that taxpayers give them even more money so they can pay their light bills while they furlough American workers.

American CEOs and the various Boards of Directors are the most unpatriotic people on the planet. And you can’t fool me. I’ve seen the receipts."
2020-09-24 18:21,"Harry Reid recently reminded us that Moscow Mitch opposed a President Obama at every turn  - judges, healthcare, the environment, economic relief for their collapsing of the economy. He refuses to work with Democrats and allowed the travesty of the Biden witch hunt - just a election ploy but I expect he will be under the microscope when he finally leaves the Senate. There are honest Republicans but they are all frightened rabbits under Jackal Trump."
2020-09-24 18:32,Nothing new.  Republicans and conservative Democrats convinced FDR to cut back prematurely in 1937.  The terrible analogy comparing household budget to national economy still resonates for part of the American public.
2020-09-24 19:08,Nancy Pelosi is playing politics with the recovery.  She actually seems to want to delay payments.
2020-09-24 19:12,"Another botched Republican management of an economic downturn being passed off to an incoming Democratic president. For the economy's sake, the Democrats better control all the levers of government because the Republicans, with control of the Senate will torpedo everything because McConnell will go for that ""make him a one term president"" trick again."
2020-09-24 17:38,"This was sadly very predictable.  Our government is in a hurry to do not nearly enough to help people.  As soon as it looks like stimulus is starting to work, they freak about the deficit and pull back, killing all the progress we have made.   This is going to be just like 2008, only worse."
2020-09-24 19:07,"Don't count on Trump or anyone from his corrupt, criminal syndicate to help everyday Americans out of this economic catastrophe. He will show up to massage the pampered feet of billionaires and the corporate elite, but he will throw everyone else under the economic bus and laugh hysterically as we are all evicted, default on mortgages, are jettisoned from our jobs and livelihoods, and starve to death. Nothing could make him happier. ""I along can fix it, folks."" What a liar, and what a loser."
2020-09-24 19:16,"Fiscal policy can't rescue the country from the effects of Fed policy. During the past 11 years, the self-serving Fed has transferred trillions of tax dollars and lost interest on savings from the middle classes and seniors to Wall Street, suppressing spending, labor participation, and wages for all but the wealthy, while simultaneously increasing income inequality. Asking for more taxpayer spending, typically on wasteful if not corrupt projects, will only exacerbate the effects of Fed policy. In order to improve and stabilize the economy, there needs to be coordination between monetary and tax policies. For example, pre-Reagan tax rates would have helped counteract the effects of recent Fed policy."
2020-09-24 18:11,There was no “mistake”. One party limited effective stimulus because it sought to damage a truly elected President (ie popular vote and warped Electoral College) rather than help the country as a whole. This same party has turned against this nation’s own intelligence agencies in favor of misinformation campaigns launched by foreign adversaries because members of this party are afraid of mean Tweets from their con artist leader. Stop playing so nice and delicate and soft and weak with language. There was no “mistake”. There was a deliberate campaign to sabotage a President and sow division.
2020-09-24 17:22,It is the Tea Party that his hamstringing the recovery.
2020-09-24 18:35,"The article, like most in the NY Times, leaves out an international comparison of the recovery after 2008

So lets have a look back 2010.   From the leading German
Weekly's English edition

“ Trans-Atlantic Turbulence: Nobel Economist Krugman Slams German Austerity”

""Nobel prize-winning economist Paul Krugman says that Germany has begun imposing austerity measures far too soon”

                                   Der Spiegel  21.06.2010

Was Krugman right ?  No.  

 A plot of the GPP per capita for Germany and the US
shows that the Germany economy recovered faster and more completely than that of the US.   And by 2014 unemployment rate in the US was still 6.2% whereas
Germany's it had fallen to  4.98%

So why did German ""Austerity"" work ?

What matters in a recovery is less than the amount spent, but HOW it is  spent. In 2012, making use of ultra low interest rates,  Mark Zuckerberg refinanced his Palo Alto Home at 1% (less than the rate of inflation) while millions of non-credit worthy home owners with underwater mortgages lost their homes

That is NOT the way to get the economy going.   But the Fed and Congress has learned nothing.  The Fed is printing money for the rich, and Congress has yet to discover the German concept of “Kurzarbeit” that keeps workers on their jobs in a crisis.

""Zuckerberg's Loan Gives New Meaning to the 1%""

2020-09-24 17:48,"The Republicans don't see the wisdom of the economists' warning, instead focusing their attention on the appointment of a new justice as their rallying cry.

Principle is all well and good, but to quote James Carville, ""It's the economy, stupid."" In warning about the appointment of a new justice, Biden cautions us about the ACA, and that's a really good point. But there's larger and even darker side to COVID-19 (it that's possible): one can brush aside, perhaps, the deaths of 200,000 citizens and say, ""well if I get it, I get it."" But one cannot brush aside epic unemployment, the repercussions of which will ripple throughout the economy, as the unemployed cut back on purchasing and businesses declare bankruptcy. It's striking on the Magnificent Mile in Chicago (store and restaurants closing), it's striking here in South Florida, and it's striking in the agricultural hinterlands as institutions and the regular consumer buys less and farmers plow the crops under.

I hope Biden will connect these three: the pandemic,  unemployment, and the worst recession since the Great Depression. It didn't need to be this way, but for the negligence of Donald Trump and his Republican enablers, of Mitch McConnell and his Republican pinchpennies."
2020-09-24 19:05,It wasn’t a mistake in 2009. Senator McConnell wanted to ensure the first Black president had only one term and blocked any help for the American people to help rebuild the economy. Trillions in debt for Trump has been no problem at all.
2020-09-24 17:47,"My question is, does it count as a mistake if the GOP did it intentionally to hobble the Obama presidency?"
2020-09-24 18:02,The aggressive response was effective for a certain strata of society.  The NYTs reported yesterday that the top 1% of wealthy people control 44% of the economy.  That number is unsustainable in a working democracy.  Literally the country is now a plutocracy.  The political system has aided and abetted this absurd level of income disparity.  We know the Fed jumped right in to help the wealthy corporate interests.  They called it stabilizing the economy.  The Fed and the Congress unleashed untold billions of dollars to stabilize the stock market interests that Trump wants to coddle.   The rest they got a drop in the bucket as to what their needs were.  Where is the Fed in stabilizing their plight?  Well that is the Congress' job.  The GOP seems satisfied with current state of affairs.  They complain that more money would mostly go to dead beats who should be looking for a job.

2020-09-24 19:27,"In 1937, FDR became worried about how much he was spending and pulled back a bit, plunging the country  back into the Great Depression.   A classic case that informed Ben Bernanke's response in 2009."
2020-09-24 19:47,Every serious economist knows that the Great Depression would have been far less severe had more capital been injected into the economy at the time and the same for the Great Recession.
2020-09-24 19:50,"It is excruciating how tone deaf bordering on brain  dead on the economy and added stimulus Congress and the Administration truly are. J Powell has made this painfully clear over and over again. Our safety net hardly exists which the pandemic has exposed. Small businesses that have not closed have stretched their debt and drained savings. By not acting we will prolong hard times that make the current status of society seem very tame. This government continues to abandon ""We the People""!"

2020-09-24 19:57,"Throwing money at the economy in a way that generates job growth but does't pay off the debt like the Trump administration has been doing, is unsustainable.

2020-09-24 20:00,"For all their willingness to extend their largesse to the wealthy and corporations, neoliberals in the GOP and the (mercifully) fewer in Democratic Party seem to have only one solution to offer: punitive austerity for those who cannot be blamed for the country’s descent into an economic collapse of this administration’s making."
2020-09-24 20:02,"It was no coincidence the GOP's recent pretend relief package was called the ""Skinny Bill"", because it is their goal to reduce most Americans to starving wage slaves, anxious to return to work under the most horrendous of conditions. If one expendable widget dies, no problem, there's always another to replace them. It is outright sadism to withhold monies while people are lined up for blocks to get into food pantries and are on the brink of financial ruin.

What astonishes me even more, is that this is being done right before November. McConnell and Graham are both up for reelection; their states were already basket cases pre-pandemic,  and they are so supremely confident that they'll be returned to office they  won't even feign concern for the welfare of their constituents. On the other hand, the voters in these states have proven themselves so willing to accept abuse and neglect over decades, perhaps its not a miscalculation after all."
2020-09-24 20:27,"The 2009 recovery worked out just fine for the Oligarchs who caused the Great Recession, while the right-wing media bubble blamed everything on Obama.
Why would the GOP do anything different this time?"
2020-09-24 20:34,"This has got to stop. The economy of the country is being wrecked because Republicans, and indeed, most people believe in a myth. They think the budget of the federal gov is similar to their household budget. If you spend $X, you have to find the money by taxing or borrowing. This is just wrong, wrong, wrong. 

Here is the reason. 

THE FEDERAL GOV CAN CREATE AS MUCH MONEY AS IT NEEDS OUT OF THIN AIR. IT WILL NEVER RUN OUT OF DOLLARS. 

Here is the way it works. Suppose Congress were to pass the Democrats' $3 TRILLION relief bill. As soon as the President signed it, someone at the FED would wander over to a keyboard, hit a few keys, and $3 TRILLION would appear in the Treasury's account. It has to be that way. We need the money now. We cannot wait for a tax bill to be passed and the money collected. We can't wait for the Treasury to hold an auction, sell bonds and collect the money. 

This money will increase the deficit, but it is not ""debt"" in the usual sense. It is owed to nobody. It never has to be repaid. The is no cost to the taxpayer. 

Now, in normal times, we MIGHT have to worry about inflation because we might have too much money chasing not enough stuff. BUT NOT TODAY. 10's of millions are suffering from a shortage of money. Inflation is 1% and the trend line is DOWN. If anyone want to shout Wiemar, show me the figures. Point to BLS or CBO reports or reputable economists saying inflation is right around the corner. 

Stop believing in myths!"
2020-09-24 20:40,"Millions of Americans face food insecurity, uncertain housing, joblessness and underemployment.

When macroeconomic measures of human misery compare with the Great Depression, limits on public assistance amount shrugging like Marie Antoinette learning the people lack bread, 'Let them eat cupcakes.'

So you decide that you must spend no money on the internet so that Amazon may deliver you food and provisions until you can return to civilization. You lost your job and you will have to find another which may take a year due to you age and unrare skills. So you decide that you will not buy anything more until you have a job, because you will need your money, later. 

Our economy is interrupted by a natural disaster and it will not grow again until it's over. Austerity will just reduce the economy a lot more and it will not make a recovery come any sooner."

By November, 250,000 Americans will have died of COVID, in red and blue states, with no end in sight.  This performance is the worst of any major country in the world, due to Trump’s deliberate denial and stubborn incompetence.

The November election will be a referendum on Trump’s failed response to COVID.  Trump keeps trying to change the subject, but the Democrats should maintain the focus on COVID.

In a free and fair election, Trump will lose by a landslide, and his GOP enablers will also lose big.

There can be no progress in health or economics, until Trump leaves office in Jan. 2021.

That’s my point. Our politicians are sellouts to corporations and billionaires. Even the Supreme Court has been politicized. Mitch McConnell is an evil man who has no morals whatsoever. While the country suffers from no stimulus, he pushes through an illegitimate Supreme Court nomination. We can and must do better in electing our representatives."

If any other readers work at companies like mine who have taken to an almost full work-from-home position, then it is likely their companies have also realized that it is capable of working at may be looking at allowing it to become a permanent option.

Much of our economy is built around servicing the professionals who commute to work. For the forseeable future, I will not be frequenting the restaurants I used to and will likely continue to cook more for myself. My fuel consumption is down dramatically and with that the wear and tear on my car and need to plan for maintenance / potential replacement. Out of state travel has almost been completely eliminated and most hotels rely heavily on business class travelers - not leisure.

Anecdotally, every one of my friends who made a decent living before is doing just fine and their jobs are not at risk. It's my friends who worked in the service industry who are still unemployed with a questionable outlook. I can't see this changing anytime soon and I can't see how stimulus funds will help that much. The manufacture of physical goods is either done by foreigners or robots so a spike in demand of manufactured goods will have little impact on their employment prospects."
2020-09-24 21:44,"That’s what worsened the Great Depression; the lack of fiscal stimulus; same thing happened in the Great Recession and it’s going to prolong this recess too. Our economy is going to be very different post Covid 19, so it’s got to be all kinds of relief, unemployment, food stamps and retraining in the job market. Lots and lots of money for a long time.

Meanwhile Trump’s tax breaks to millionaires and corporations has now exploded our national debt and trickled down to nowhere and nothing.

Even more amazingly, the reporters claim that we should fault President Obama for ""failing to convince"" a GOP House to support the economy back in 2010.

However, we know that Mitch McConnell and Paul Ryan refused to authorize additional stimulus in order to damage Democrats politically. Then, as now, the Republican Party has shown a willingness to allow Americans to suffer in order to achieve their electoral and ideological goals.

Someone else benefited, regardless of the stated goals.  By finding who that was, you will find who legislators and administrators are talking with and acting for. Recent tax cuts and COVID unemployment legislation are clear examples.

Tightening campaign financing laws will once again reduce the ability to buy your own legislation via hidden donations.  As we now know, current rules are a bad deal for all but the very rich and wealthy corporations who buy themselves  more and more rights while the 99% get less and less.  

So ask yourself, who benefited from the last slow economic recovery.  Since the GOP orchestrated both, who are their favorite donors?  It's not surprising that the stock market is doing well, and the many without savings to purchase stock are going under."

They ""proved"" how good Trump has done by showing a bar graph of what happened under Obama's 8 years versus what Trump claims today he has done.

Well, except the bars include what President Obama inherited, and did not include the past 6 months of what has happened to Trump. And they said they were waiting for data from the Census Bureau!!!

Best as I know, the last 3 years of Obama's term looked a bit better than Trumps first 3.

Go back 6 months and go forward 6 months and... 

But THAT'S not Trump's fault right?"

2020-09-25 2:04,"I object to the authors saying ""economic theory"" tells us to spend in a Depression. Could you substitute that for decent thoughtful people? Neo-classical economics has brought austerity every time. Galbraith, Keynes - i.e. a few economists argued one cannot push a string! Many more people have, over 400 years, demanded an improvement to their starvation, despair, homelessness. As well, I'd be generous to central banks with far right governments on their backs: threats of sackings; minimising the central banks' roles etc. Their only power over governments is they are self-financing, and can't be starved of funds. Our RBA has been braver than the Fed, but Yellen now Powell defend the full employment to the HILT. Think of the politics and sociology of all this, and stop getting economics to give you ""reputations"", especially when your knowledge of central banks is so thin."

This country is in the same position as the young women of a certain age were seeking in an older wealthy mate, we as a nation have one foot in the grave and another on a banana peel. 
We’re it not for Covid 19 and the excuse to throw trillions at these zombie companies as many as twenty percent of these companies would be history and many CEOs would be looking at possible, although unlikely given white collar crime is rarely punished in The USA, prison sentences according to unbiased news sources such as the Financial Times. 
When and if we come out of this there will be the same big winners like Schwartzmans Blackstone and Peltz Trian, and there will be the same millions or more out on the street.

The congress knows it as well, but I suspect the  wealthy donors only demand tax cuts and stimulus for themselves and not for the working class. This guarantees that their fortunes do not get eroded by inflation and may push this country into a deflationary period. THis is what oligarchy looks like. By the way if the opposite were true and the wealthy wanted spending for the masses, congress would get it done lickedy split."
2020-09-25 9:11,"""But Mr. Obama was unable to win approval for further large-scale stimulus efforts, and by 2010 Congress had effectively ceded to the Federal Reserve the job of managing the still-tenuous economic recovery""
Ron Suskind in his ""Confidence Men"" states very clearly who was responsible for this.  Larry Summers was the chief villain shooting down the large stimulus while Christina Romer, the only person who was advocating something more than $1 trillion was blocked from even meeting with Obama.  The other enabler for almost criminal negligence was Rahm Immanuel, Obama's Chief of Staff.  Suskind also documents in his book the early male chauvinism that prevailed in the Obama administration starting with Obama himself that Romer suffered through.  A lot of women were chosen for the administration but they were mostly treated as window dressing and did not participate in the meetings that mattered.  Again, Larry Summers who was fired from Harvard for his sexist comments played a starring role for constantly trying to take over all economic policy decisions.  Summers and Emmanuel are still around advising Biden currently.  It is not clear why Casselman and Smialek would not name the people mainly responsible for the fiscal policy circus in the Obama White House.  Unless we name and shame the people who fail, they keep recirculating in the system and gain new leases of life in Washington."
2020-09-25 9:26,"Don't blame the Dems this time when McConnell & the GOP gang go from $1T to $500B to $300B while Speaker Pelosi is willing to go from $3.4T to $2T. 

Negotiation means you meet in the middle. So $2T including helps to states, cities and schools make sense. After all, people live and work there; and inside the beltway is an artificial address. 

Incidentally, I have no qualm the package has something to help out the airlines. Like it or not, transportations are essential services. Those who argue against it as a way to punish the airlines miss the point, it is just an act of cutting-the-nose-to-spite-the-face. In time of crisis, you need to set aside retribution first.

Like this coronavirus pandemic, this reluctance to follow through to support the wounded economy is self-inflicted"
2020-09-25 9:37,"The GOP has sunk into its eternal claim that helping the people brings out their laziness, so of course, we have to let them suffer in order to get them to work. It was the GOP obstruction which blocked the second round of relief last time. Then they blamed the slowness of the recovery on Obama. Now they obstruct again (the Dem controlled House passed a bill months ago). Meanwhile, their guy in the White House takes credit for the latter years of the recovery when things really took and gets credit from much of the public for those years even though he actually did little to deserve it. 

So, now the self-proclaimed ""deal maker"" takes a very passive role in the whole drive for a bill (or any bill, for that matter) simply saying what he will or will not sign (so much for being a deal maker). Likely, at this point, with a possibility that Trump will lose in Nov., the GOP sees a benefit in letting the economy languish. Why make the recovery good if the Democrats might get credit? Why not put their hands in their pockets and then by spring by shouting that Biden hasn't ""fixed the economy yet""?"
2020-09-25 9:40,"If the Con Man wins the election, the GOP will offer more financial relief provided there are more tax cuts for corporations and the wealthy and massive cuts to social services for the rest of us.

2020-09-25 12:25,"Disagree re Obama and the Congress not doing enough.

Obama rescued us from the greatest economic disaster since the Great Depression with careful stewardship that resulted in boring, steady, growth and low unemployment, a modern day record.

2020-09-25 12:41,"This is the typical liberal worldview of blaming problems on not doing more of something that's nonsensical. The last recession dragged on because unemployment benefits were extended, regulations were tightened, businesses were attacked and government spending ballooned. Fiscal stimulus is a temporary sugar high and does not help the economy in the medium/long term. Especially now when the only slack in the economy is in sectors where people won't spend money even if they have more of it. A lot of businesses are posting record results and would hire more workers if they could. If the government stepped out of the way and stopped paying people not to work, the economy would readjust and unemployment would be below 5% (a few pilots may have to wait it out). Funny how I never see articles arguing for reduced stimulus/spending when the economy is booming. It's always spend, spend, spend."
2020-09-25 12:49,"The lack of stimulus following the 2009 collapse was not, as you write in the headline, a mistake. It was an intentional Republican strategy. Simply look at the voting patterns and rhetoric of Republicans at that time and this time. Stimulus works and improves the well-being of the people. The Republicans put their desire to harm Obama over the good of the people."
2020-09-25 13:00,"Unfortunately, Speaker Pelosi has prioritized aid to states over aid to individual Americans.  Because of her all-or-nothing approach, individuals were deprived of the equivalent of another $1200 relief check (2 weeks of the $600 unemployment *bonus*) when they started negotiating.  It's hard to understand how that denial of aid could be justified.

The state aid should be a separate negotiation.  Speaker Pelosi should not interfere with the Trump economic team's recovery strategy.  They have demonstrated they know what they're doing.  The PPP was a smart move, which helped tens of millions of small businesses.  A second more targeted PPP would go a long way to keeping small businesses from going under."
2020-09-25 13:29,"This happened before in the First Republican Great Depression. 

By 1937, the economy had improved.  FDR gave in to Republican pressure and scaled back the amount of government spending.

2020-09-25 13:38,"""But Mr. Obama was unable to win approval for further large-scale stimulus efforts"" There you have the crux of the problem. McConnell publicly stating that nothing the President (Obama) proposes will be allowed to pass. Obstruction by the Republicans caring nothing for the American people. Pelosi stands as a window, a transparent view into the backroom conspiracy to hold power in favour of the rich and elite."
2020-09-25 13:46,"Republicans always worry about deficits when it comes to helping the common man/woman.

And yet their supporters in rural areas vote for them loyally, year after year.

After the Dems win this year, yes I am sure they will, they must come up with an easy to understand explanation of govt spending and taxing so that low income white people understand how Democratic policies benefit them economically.

I have read that in many rural towns, the whites are unwilling to vote for measures that help them because the help will also go to people of color. If hate is that strong, we may not see change until this generation dies out."

Senator Mitch McConnell has refused to pass the bill. He would rather go on vacation than face the fact that people are suffering unemployment, and loosing their homes and businesses."

2020-09-25 14:51,"The Fed and Congress failed to bail out Main Street, but they certainly took care of corporations, Wall Street, inflated assets, and protected hedge funds/vulture capitalists.

It's not just a failure to put people back to work with the employer of last resort ... the federal government. It's a failure to address the steady accumulation of imbalances over the past forty-plus years.

We have a great opportunity here to redirect the American economy in a positive direction."
2020-09-25 15:54,"Congress' focus should be on giving financial aid to people who have lost their job and small businesses who need help to survive. Don't give everybody a $1,200 check when they haven't lost employment, are retired or were not in the workforce by choice. Give aid to states and local governments so that they don't have to layoff essential workers and reimburse them for lost revenues and extra costs for fighting virus. Cover health care costs for the unemployed and Covid19 expenses for  those without health insurance."
2020-09-25 16:00,"Both parties are led and dominated by very wealthy and very corporate-connected individuals whose indifference to ordinary Americans constitute significant overlap between the two.  Both parties, to be sure, also have significant populist elements who are suppressed with equal ruthlessness by those same overlapping big money tyrants.  The only solution is destruction of the two-party system, the only material crack to which so far has been the ascendancy of Trump."

2020-09-25 16:06,"The failure in 2009 to provide sufficient stimulus to prevent the Great Recession was intentional.  Republicans in Congress did not want Obama to succeed, and preferred driving the country into the ground than improve Obama’s re-election chances.  NYT’s own Dr. Krugman sounded that alarm early and often, an he was right."

There are only a few hundred citizens of the country.  The rest of us are all serfs because the government holds up a document that approves slavery and tells us that it says that we are all created equal.

With the seminal lies that everyone in this alternate reality called the United States learns, it is no wonder that so many Americans actually feel proud to hail from this apartheid caste system of a country."

2020-09-25 17:10,"Congress needs to work together (ha!) and put together a stimulus bill that assists those that have been unable to find work (not that desire to not work, so no $600 plus unemployment), to make sure that fraud does not occur (as it did in the last stimulus), and one that provides assistance to states for coronavirus impact ONLY, and not 100%  None of us will be 100% whole coming out of this, except for the few Amazon-like companies.

I am most concerned about fraud as my Senator has sponsored a bill (a Republican, but with bipartisan support) that would forgo investigations into fraud permanently awarding those loans as free grants.  This, when many of those that committed fraud are known!  The banks are also held harmless as many, especially small banks, didn't vet the people submitting for a loan; they just took the 5% (loans under 1 million) and are never to have to answer."

In the US, the problem is Trump. But The Netherlands has a stable, liberal government and I have to say there are a lot of similarities between the corona policies of both countries. Testing has run aground, the app is still not working, the government lied about facemasks in retirement homes and top government advisers have severe conflicts of interest."

2020-09-24 22:58,"It is possible that the disease has run through the vulnerable populations already - the old, the obese, the diabetic and folks who are so extroverted they can't stay away from others.

2020-09-24 23:50,"That is totally bizarre how can they act so surprised at this ‘unexpected’ surge of infections. What did they think would happen after the restrictions were lifted before elimination of the virus? It’s been nine months since discovery of COVID. Did not we learn anything at all? There is no such thing as ‘suppression’ of COVID. It is just mathematically impossible. The only two options are (i) elimination via persistently enforced restrictive measures with eventual mass vaccination or (ii) full-blown epidemic where most people get infected and herd immunity is reached. The exponential function can either go to zero or infinity depending on the sign of the exponent. It cannot remain constant - that is simple maths. With R>1 it grows, with R<1 it decreases. And the difference between the two can be minuscule it terms of actual restrictions. It is better to gather the collective will and eliminate it once and for all as fast as possible than keep it festering for years going in and out of quarantines. The mathematics of this pandemics should be obvious to all by now. You cannot ‘save’ the economy by infecting everyone and killing millions of people. That is a complete delusion. Do the quarantine once and do it right. There is no other way."
2020-09-25 0:18,"The number of those testing positive is not the only important number. This is angering that newspapers and television news are so obsessed with case numbers. Hospitalizations are low and staying that way. Deaths are low and staying that way. It’s almost like the media is upset that parts of the world are managing the virus in a way that takes the entire picture into consideration. I’m sorry we can’t all just wreck every business like what happened in New York. An article today practically drooled over a play here in the Berkshires where they practiced extreme, unnecessary, over the top precautions and the reporter practically cried tears of joy. New Yorkers are almost proud of what their city has become this year. How embarrassing!"
2020-09-25 1:46,"For the past two weeks the news about CoVid wave has a prefix ,
-Second (wave). Scientifically and epidemiologically, a search to define the Second Wave for the Sars Covid-2 virus is an uphill task. I could read about the Fifth Wave in China.

What is the definition of Covid waves starting from number one to Five in China? Did China ,the land of Viruses explicitly reach the end of the first wave to speak about the onset of the second wave and in the same way up to the present naming of the fifth wave. 

Virus that has a breakout from the nature's  flora and fauna would naturally spread, disperse, stick  ,sink and  make its host compatible  to live with it over the time .

The wave pattern and penetration power of the virus or bacteria -natural could be controlled, mitigated and easy to develop a vaccine . But if the virus breakout is accidental in an experiment to make a recombinant virus(as few suspect)
by taking into account of the revelations of Prof,GIUSEPPE TRITTO and Dr.Yan's report, we have to learn with it for few more years.( Ref: interview to WION TV )

Proximity and a sort of agitation in its 'Covid-conducive"" environment ,it becomes active and discharge in proportion to the degree of immunity threshold of the infected. It makes the current second wave in Europe to fifth wave in china are the names to facilitate their administrative and political governance sans the significance of  the specific scientific terminology.  
Covid spread has a  brake without break."
2020-09-25 2:30,"Doctors and scientists are closing in on better treatments for the severely ill.   They've got proning and oxygenation now, and they've caught on to the cytokine and bradykinin chain reactions, and have the drugs to treat them.   A little more testing, and they can probably reduce the death rate by 90% in all but the most feeble and elderly patients - and drastically reduce the number of ""long-haulers"" as well.   

Three cheers for science and technology!   It's great to live in the 21st century."
2020-09-25 2:59,"When the studies are finally completed and the true cost of this pandemic are tabulated, the liberal politicians and health “experts” who forced the lockdowns should all be tried in a court and be jailed for life for the damage inflicted upon us all. 

The loss in QUALITY of life for the population at large far outweighs the number of deaths for patients with preexisting morbidities."
2020-09-25 3:04,"“There was no lag back in March because we only tested people who were already in the hospital. At a certain point, your I.C.U.’s are going to fill up.”

In other words, the total number of cases has always been understated since the start with only the sickest being tested and being found positive. The vast majority of infections were never diagnosed and people went about their daily lives. Essentially, this means the fatality rates are overstated by wide margins and could eventually be brought into line with the common flu. 

I wouldn’t be surprised if Trump is vindicated eventually."
2020-09-25 3:46,"Europe is in better shape than the US in one important regard: they haven't developed the antivax mindset that has spread throughout parts of the US, which threatens to delay vaccine availability in this country.  For example, the trial of the AstraZeneca candidate has resumed in the UK, but is still on hold in the US.

The available information suggests that there will be one or more safe, effective vaccines by the end of the calendar year.  Like the US, Europe has a vigorous regulatory infrastructure for medicines, and won't approve a vaccine without strong evidence of safety and efficacy.  But unlike the US, the process hasn't become heavily politicized, one example of the politicization being NY Gov. Cuomo's promise to superimpose state regulation on top of the FDA.

Thus, it seems likely Europe will be able to vaccinate, ending the pandemic, before the US.  We'll see how it plays out.  It seems that with regard to a vaccine, Europe is wiser than we are."
2020-09-25 4:32,"The number of COVID patients in the ICU at the hospital where I work have crept slowly upwards again, even though my state is among those with relatively low infection rates.
While we are nowhere yet near the worst of the first surge, winter and returning college students may indeed bring that expected second surge."
2020-09-25 6:19,"I find it grotesque that current discussion focus on whether we will do better now for instance in Europe compared to the beginning of the pandemics, when the beginning brought 100 (one hundred !) times more deaths in much of Europe than in South Korea, Taiwan, New Zealand and other civilized countries. The ""social distancing + masking but no-lockdown"" strategy brought 10 times more deaths to Sweden compared to nearby countries that went into lockdown. 

Thus, Europe is grossly at risk of a further 10X increase of deaths, and with 10X more deaths in Europe, the full potential of virus lethality will be attained (0.5-1% under full hospital capacity) ! 

In other terms, nothing will have been achieved. This prediction is very approximate and hopefully wrong, yet it is clear that what we have achieved so far in Europe is to stop the number of deaths to 5-10% of the virus potential, which is unbelievably high. The question whether this will now go further up ""fast or slow"" is important yet meaningless without context.

The situation in USA seems much worse,

Finally, deaths are a reliable parameter, but real life would require that we do not neglect the many sometimes severe long-term sequelae found in the patients who survived severe illness."
2020-09-25 6:37,"We are an American family in a red zone in France. It seems everything is focused on keeping kids in school throughout this long winter ahead of us. 

You can’t forget that Europeans have mostly free healthcare, the personal risk assessment is different. You are unlikely to lose your home due to co-pays (or job!) if hospitalized in France or Germany. 
A teacher in France doesn’t think about the financial ramifications while an American is forced to daily."
2020-09-25 9:05,"I am a practicing economist. Studied the subject. Wrote about it. Direct a Council concerned with economic matters. Yet I find my self appalled at the constant pleas in behalf of the economy...as if somehow the economy is some sort of holy Ghost. 

Society does not exist for the sake of the economy. It is the reverse. Economies are dispensable...if one doesn't serve the well being of a social order it deserves to be replaced with another. 

Now sadly, in my profession economics and its practitioners and advocates have become callous to welfare of the client. Caveat emptor has returned in another disguise. Anything that touches $$ is sacrosanct. For those who merit society for it decency and compassion take what is left over. So, open the economy and the bystanders take their licks. Hurrah for the GDP; booh for the Mortality Rate. 

But just what is that venerated economy that suffers so from lock down? Near 40 percent of it is incidental activity and response to indulgent self inflicted harms. Just why   should individual be willing to risk their health or the health of their loved ones for nonessential activities. 

What are these venerated activities in the economic sectors? Above all entertainment e.g, bars, restaurants, festivals, beauty parlors, casinos, sports, etc. Hospitals have to cancel  cosmetic surgery and other routine services. And children languish because parents have had to resume parenting...a rather dull activity. Better to work with colleagues."
2020-09-25 9:55,"'Lag' is the operative word. Let's give it another a couple of weeks and then see. Here in Lisbon we are waiting to see how things unfold in Madrid, just 500km away where it is expected some ICU units could hit peak capacity by the end of September. Schools went back only last week and people will be spending more time indoors as the weather gets colder. Hospitalisations and ICU admissions are starting to climb again here in Portugal.

One thing we notice as expats living on the Spanish/Portuguese Peninsula is that mask compliance is 100%. Everyone wears them - all of the time. Southern Europeans also have real respect for their elderly relatives and will be doing as much as possible as a family unit to shield them from the virus than they would have back in March, when it was not known how deadly this virus could be, particularly for the elderly.

I'm not an expert, these are just my anecdotal observations from living in Europe."
2020-09-25 12:27,"I'm thinking the primary reason hospitalizations are down is because we're better educated.

2020-09-25 8:34,"Why the presumption that there will be a rise in hospitalizations? The Dutch newspapers and media merely report the numbers, and we all know which website to go to see them more in detail.

2020-09-25 9:36,"We have now put higher restrictions on a county basis, starting with Dublin last week and now Donegal. Despite strong controls in public , the house parties are causing rapid spread of the virus. This has exposed the hypocrisy of people who are working remotely but then acting differently behind closed doors with dinner parties on the weekend. I’m hoping schools don’t close again, our kids need their education to be a priority."
2020-09-25 13:51,"We're not seeing deaths and hospitalisations because people aren't ill. 

Everyone knows the 'cases' numbers are meaningless and the testing is over-sensitive, and riddled with false positives.

The small increase in deaths, hospitalisations etc is of people 'with' COVID, not deaths from COVID.

I don't know anyone that's ill from COVID and neither do the people I talk to and meet. 

Let's face it - it's pretty much over in Western Europe. As Rishi said, let's 'live without fear'."
2020-09-25 11:13,"Readers here might be interested in this photo-essay from the Guardian today, providing a retrospective on the first wave and touching on the prospect now from a Welsh NHS hospital.

<a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2020/sep/25/inside-a-welsh-icu-during-the-coronavirus-pandemic-photo-essay"" target=""_blank"">https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2020/sep/25/inside-a-welsh-icu-during-the-coronavirus-pandemic-photo-essay</a>

""We were only able to care for almost three times our normal number of patients because of the extraordinary efforts of former ICU staff who returned to help and those from other wards and areas of the hospital, particularly the operating theatres, who volunteered to work in intensive care. For them, the intensity of the environment, sophisticated equipment and exposure to large numbers of deaths frequently lay far outside their normal working experience. At the peak, with beds placed between our normal beds and a number of temporary units created, many admitted to finding the experience terrifyingly overwhelming, and told of returning home after their shift exhausted and unable to stop crying.""

Even though he had a personal taste of that reality, our bumptious, dilettante Prime Minister has apparently learnt nothing and is impervious to the well-founded dread building here. Best wishes to everyone everywhere. We certainly need them here."
2020-09-25 9:43,"Possibly the soundest statement in the article is the one in the closing: “the number of hospital admissions cannot be interpreted in various ways,” Ms. Wilmès said. “It is an indisputable indicator that allows us to measure the severity of the situation.” 

This is a mean disease and we have all been taken aback. But there comes the time to gather up and think pragmatically. 
Being airborne, this disease has spread at will in every busy, densely populated city, which show pretty much identical high contagion periods (and hence, mortality over time curves). But biology stubbornly acts, and now those areas that have overcome high contagion exhibit a rather low, persistent trickle of cases. Areas that have not been widely affected will be, unless a robust and effective test-trace-isolate is in action. 

The rest is, as they say, background music."
2020-09-25 10:22,"Dr Fauci is right that it is difficult to achieve natural herd immunity  - I do enjoy his taking down troller Paul who was a Duke's trained ophthalmologist no less - without more deaths. However, SARSCoV2 is not as novel as a few months ago. While people need to keep up with their hygiene, the world goes on, in a cautious way, until validated vaccines arrive to give us greater protection. Neither extreme, i.e., total shutdown or wanton disregard, makes sense.

First, governments worldwide need to support the frontline HCWs and general populations need to exercise caution.

Then, governments worldwide need to coordinate. COVID doesn't have a border. No one is safe until everyone is safe. Ergo, take politics and human vanity out of the pandemic!

Finally, governments worldwide need to support their citizens. Don't make them choose between catching the disease or dying of starvation or being evicted"
2020-09-25 5:34,"I live in Greece. Although the numbers here started out low, they are increasing fast. The country opened up to tourism in the summer and this was a failed attempt to drive up the economy. The economy lagged and worse the Greeks got on their high horses and stopped wearing masks, and social distancing. Beaches maxed out. 

Half of this population won't wear their masks. The church is telling people wearing a mask is accepting the devil, and kids run around the school yards with no masks, no social distancing. The police even refuse to wear it. There are no role models except what you see on TV, so it must not feel like it's a fantasy to them. The adults wear it under their nose, on their head or not at all. Some wear the polyester masks that spread the disease. People are clueless. 

What is more incredible is health care workers, & airport personnel, are not provided KN95's. In fact, walking through three hospitals this week, I only saw one nurse wearing a KN95. It's not a question of supply. It's shameful and absurd.

Kids are being forced to go to school in this condition, because homeschooling is illegal. The govt. can't get the education ministry to make a proper curricula on line so we all have to put ourselves in danger.

I feel like I live in a third world country."
2020-09-25 3:23,"Liberals who say that people who get Covid are idiots who don't wear masks make me laugh. Im a queer transgender independent and no one I know wears masks anymore except when going into a place that forces you to wear a mask. When I have clients that come into my business they have their mask on but the first thing they ask is if Im cool with them taking it off. As I don't particularly believe in masks I usually say thats fine. Ive interacted with people all over the nation for weeks. Ive flown to 5 states since July. I wear masks in other people's businesses and in places that force me too but I don't really care otherwise. Ive never gotten sick. No one I know got sick in Colorado. My brother got it in the south and was fine a couple days later. I have interacted with literally hundreds of people and none of them or me has gotten even a sniffle. The shutdown cost my business literally hundreds of thousands of dollars, in fact I almost lost my livelihood that took me 10 years to build. The lock down killed thousands of small businesses. To do what? Nothing. Absolutely nothing besides increase corporate power over society by destroying the livihoods of millions of people. 200,000 people died, but most of them would have probably died of a bad case of the flu, which also kills tens of thousands of people a year to no crazy lock down or fear mongering. Open up and get back to work."
