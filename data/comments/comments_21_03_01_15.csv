Somehow I think not. It is remarkable how many folks who supported Trump as president will now reject the vaccine he brought to us via ‘warp speed’. If George Bush had brought us BushCare with affordable premiums it would have been accepted by all. But since it was a Hillary to Barack product, it was tainted indelibly."
2021-03-15 13:17:29,"The faith based communities are to be praised for their efforts which are admirable, ethical and morally correct.
 Sadly, but realistically, Trump is needed to tell his republican lemming like followers that HE was vaccinated and they should be vaccinated. Right now the statistics indicate that trumpers have some of the highest rates of not planning to be vaccinated, probably still believing the virus is a ""hoax""."
2021-03-15 13:00:06,"Yet Catholic bishops, or at least one reported individual, are telling people to refrain from J & J vaccine because of a fetal research issue.

Scientists need to form an alliance with responsible clergy in an atmosphere of honest mutual respect, to overcome fundamentalist denial--on both the left and right--of evidence.  Scientists can begin by discussing the role of uncertainty and failure in science.  Clergy can begin by demonstrating the role of lessons to be learned from religious mythos, and eschewing literal interpretation."
2021-03-15 15:45:25,"I was raised in the First United Methodist Church, but I haven't been to church in decades. I think the last time was when I was married in 1974. From the articles I've read over the years, it sounds like the concept of ""church"" has changed a lot since I went. In the church services I remember there was no talk of politics. Current events never entered the conversation. We had hymns, the minister gave a sermon usually centered on a bible verse, there were more hymns, a benediction and that was it. Now preachers apparently tell their congregations who to vote for and how to make money,  they sell vitamins and supplements, and I've heard that some even beg their congregations for new cars and airplanes. And, now they influence the health decisions of their members and tell them whether to get vaccinated or not. Church sure has changed, and from what I understand about it I've been wise to stay away all these years. I can't imagine stepping inside one of these places that sound less about Christ and religion and more about politics and telling people what ""God's plan"" is for their lives, as if ministers have some kind of inside info on that. No thanks."
2021-03-15 15:52:42,"A recently published survey shows that Republicans are far more hesitant to get get vaccinated than Democrats.  That is wonderful news.  In this initial period of vaccine scarcity, it means that Democrats have lots more vaccine available to them to get protected against the Corona virus.  

But there is also a beneficial political consequence from vaccine hesitancy among Republicans.  The failure of many Republicans to get vaccinated will undoubtedly raise the rate of sick and dead Republicans from Covid.  This will be especially significant among elderly Republicans, who are the most likely voters in every election.  The result will be self-imposed voter suppression among Republicans.  Hopefully, this will have major impact in the 2022 midterms.

It is all in God’s plan."

I settled on trusting Dr. Faucci and have not regretted this decision.  When one is a member of a marginalized group with a history of systemic abuse, there is a lack of trust.  Religious leaders are their Dr.  Faucci.  It is not my place to judge whether or not their beliefs are rational or irrational or why people put more faith in religion than science since I am not part of a marginalized, abused group.  I applaud the religious leaders in helping to overcome hesitancy and get all of our folks vaccinated."

While I am happy that these people will get vaccinated because ultimately that will protect everyone, it is very depressing that it takes irrational belief in a pastor, an imam, or swami having a telephone line to God to achieve this end. All the advances in physics, chemistry, biology, medicine over the last 1000 years are for nought. Why are we even bothering with things like the Nat'l Insts for Health, Center for Disease Control, and Natl Sci Foundation if 30-40% of the population is permanently stuck in the year 1000? And if a similar percentage of the population will never ever be able to comprehend something as simple as 17th century calculus, what hope is there for humanity to do anything meaningful with all the leisure time we will have when the Morlocks, excuse me machines, do all the menial work for us?"
2021-03-15 21:32:28,"Substitute ""vaccine"" for the boats and helicopter in this old joke: 

A storm descends on a small town, and the downpour soon turns into a flood. As the waters rise, the local preacher kneels in prayer on the church porch, surrounded by water. By and by, one of the townsfolk comes up the street in a canoe.

""Better get in, Preacher. The waters are rising fast.""

""No,"" says the preacher. ""I have faith in the Lord. He will save me.""

Still the waters rise. Now the preacher is up on the balcony, wringing his hands in supplication, when another guy zips up in a motorboat.

""Come on, Preacher. We need to get you out of here. The levee's gonna break any minute.""

Once again, the preacher is unmoved. ""I shall remain. The Lord will see me through.""

After a while the levee breaks, and the flood rushes over the church until only the steeple remains above water. The preacher is up there, clinging to the cross, when a helicopter descends out of the clouds, and a state trooper calls down to him through a megaphone.

""Grab the ladder, Preacher. This is your last chance.""

Once again, the preacher insists the Lord will deliver him.

And, predictably, he drowns.

A pious man, the preacher goes to heaven. After a while he gets an interview with God, and he asks the Almighty, ""Lord, I had unwavering faith in you. Why didn't you deliver me from that flood?""

God shakes his head. ""What did you want from me? I sent you two boats and a helicopter."""

Start preaching social responsibility and belief in science. God does not help those who do not help themselves (and I don''t mean to the contribution basket). If waiting for Godot is your thing, move to Zimbabwe or some other backward country where logic and science haven't entered the 21st Century - and leave US alone. If your God wanted us to be fools, to endanger all of humanity, she would have wiped us out long ago. This is just a test, and we're failing miserably."

“I feel no obligation to believe that the same god who endowed us with sense, reason and intellect intended us to forego their use!”

Spoken by Galileo over 500 years ago when he ran afoul of the Holy Inquisition by agreeing with Copernicus, that the (blasphemous) idea of the earth revolving around the sun rather than the opposite, as taught by the Church, was, in fact, true!! That got him years of house arrest, as the Church could not have that!

If you believe in god, then you should believe that god us a brain and the ability to use it. God also gave us great scientists and the scientific method, for a purpose!

I’m not a religious believer but that makes no difference. Critical thinking is necessary in life ( really, it is!) and it can be done by anyone with a little learning and a little practice!!"

Everyone wants to know if they are be treated for something p, if it’s okay to get the shot. Many of these people would take the shot if offered one by their doctor who told them it would be okay. It would be great to put the vaccine in the hands of more doctors. Many older folks also want the Johnson and Johnson, since it’s one shot and has fewer side effects."
2021-03-16 11:38:12,"Receiving a Covid vaccination is not an imposition or a right, it's a privilege. And vaccine supplies remain a limiting factor. Given this it might be worth considering a reverse psychology approach. Make vaccine supplies available on a first come first served basis. I expect you will have many takers...and as more people take it there will be less fear.  Sadly refusing the vaccine is basically a gene pool selection exercise. Hard to know how to overcome such fear other than leading by example."

They can die on their swords if they like, making the supreme sacrifice for a show of spite. The only drawback is that their refusal comes with potentially fatal consequences for innocent others. 

But that’s how Republicans roll: nothing for the public weal; only anger and resentment on their way to the waiting, crowded ICU unit or to the morgue, something else with which to blame Joe Biden."
2021-03-16 11:30:45,"As adamantly as I opposed ALMOST everything The Former Guy did to (not for) America, his pushing the production and purchase of vaccines does show that no one is always wrong.  

Giving him ""credit"" for this is correct, and allowing him to ""trump""et it as a mechanism to encourage his supporters and other vaccination deniers to line up for the jab is the American thing to do.  However, carefully script and control the message or he will go off message and ruin everything."
2021-03-16 11:36:20,"Conservative virtues guided the response to the virus from the very start. This was discernable at the level of the Trump WH.

OPther concepts like, why should we manufacture any PPE, because the ""free market system"" can solve supply issues such the one concerning PPE. Where is Jared Kushner now?

Since the failed Trump experiment, conservative virtues have no further value in running a government. That was proven. Trump is of no use to promote anything other than himself. In the wasted 77 days after his election loss, Trump could have covered this ground, but he didn't. Biden should enlist help elsewhere."

On the other hand, MS (along with MA) has the highest rate of child vaccination compliance in the country. So there must be some trust, and there must be a public health infrastructure to handle it."

Conspiracies hinted at.  Motivations questioned. Never mind that the mystery can be solved definitively with a Google search. The entire hour was designed to seed and nourish doubt about the safety and efficacy of the vaccines.  And to question the intentions of the Biden administration in pushing the vaccines.  To what good purpose, you ask?  Seems a tad dishonorable and more than a little misanthropic at this stage of the game.

And as a matter of fact, Mr. Carlson's owner... excuse me... his employer, Rupert Murdoch, received the Pfizer injection literally the day it was first available to him.  Does that answer your question as to the effectiveness and safety of the vaccines, Tucker?"

My question is this .....why haven't they been sued for the endangerment of life that they have pushed?  The Republicans in Congress pushed for their own vaccinations but heaven forbid they encourage their constituents to get vaccinated.     The great Fox in the sky might trash them on nightly TV.

I know many a die hard Trump Republican who,while still outwardly calling COVID a hoax and overblown are willing to jump the line to get a vaccine. Short story long, the more we 'urge' Republicans to get the vaccine the more likely some won't for spite. Kinda like masks.

Yesterday my new-ish neighbor asked me if my wife and I, 68 and 69 were finally going to stop sequestering ourselves and get out more. I replied with a smile that, yes, we were getting our second shot on Saturday and were looking forward to it. He told me that he, his wife, and his teenage kids were immune because they already had COVID (big surprise with all the parties they had last year). Then he told me of about a few of his upcoming trips.

In more direct terms it comes to failings in education and cognition. Instead of polling people (which provides a readout of what they say about their attitudes) ask hospitals/medical research centers for anonymized data about educational attainment and job description of people who received the vaccines vs those who refused (""hesitate""). You will find without fail that research staff (PhDs) vaccination is the highest (90+%), followed closely by those of MDs. Nurses are being vaccinated at 40-60% despite the pressure for compliance, with support staff vaccination rates circling the low thirties. That's your educational readout. As far as religion is concerned, the degree of orthodoxy serves as a useful readout of the degree of underlying cognitive dysfunction (magical thinking, failure of conflict recognition, etc). That's why in Israel the most Orthodox Jews and the fundamentalist Muslims are united in their vehement rejection of Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine (which doesn't use fetus-derived cell lines but is made using plasmid DNA produced in E. coli and bacteriophage T7 RNA polymerase). Trump did muddle messaging on pandemic response, but his most injurious effect on society was to normalize being dumb in public."
2021-03-16 12:14:05,"Joe passed 40 plus executive orders in his first 2 weeks of office, why not one or 5 that uses the power of the federal government for public health? Such as, your passport is only good if you get a vaccine? Or, to travel on federally funded roads you have to be vaccinated to protect our police as well as our first responders. Then there is the TSA rule, in order to go through airport security you need to be vaccinated. Tougher? Sure, how about, if you can be and don't get vaccinated Medicare and Medicaid won't cover your medical costs as it relates to Covid. (why should ""we the people"" pay for that?). The regulations will be endless on global warming,  how about some real action on vaccines? What Joe is doing is abdicating his responsibility as the leader of the free world, when it comes to vaccines, to the media and advertising. It's really shameful."
2021-03-16 12:04:08,"As I see it, there is no need to ""enlist"" Trump.  The fact is that Trump and his family were vaccinated in January.  It seems to me that a PSA blitz can be built around that fact, imploring his vaccine-reluctant supporters to ""go out and get yourself and your families vaccinated, like Donald Trump did!"""
2021-03-16 11:51:52,"I predicted this would be an issue last year when vaccine talks were beginning in the spring. With how big of a mess this has been, some people have mentally hunkered down as a protective mechanism in response to the chaos that COVID has inflicted. Unfortunately, that also means they're shutting themselves off from help in the form of vaccines"
2021-03-16 11:53:02,The vaccine hesitant should get out of the left lane and let the rest of us pass and get vaccinated. Once they realize they can’t travel or go to a concert without proof of vaccination they will come around.
2021-03-16 12:17:21,"Some things are not ever going to change or worth expending needless time in trying  to make it happen - to wit, convincing these recalcitrant people to shift gears and follow CDC guidelines and recommendations. And to enlist former guy's help... a bad joke. He never helped anyone and isn't about to start now. So vaccinate, vaccinate, vaccinate and hopefully enough people will get the shot/s and the country can reach herd immunity despite the obstreperous naysayers and anti-vaccinators who are not going to ever change."
2021-03-16 12:16:31,"I don't think the former guy has an altruistic bone in his body, and i don't think any argument would persuade him to do  public service work promoting vaccinations."

In today's world of the internet, this skepticism is only going to continue to grow and not only about the vaccines but about everything."
2021-03-16 12:28:12,"Although I am on the list to get a shot (J&J), too many view this as a binary decision (life or death).  There is much not understood about both the virus and the ""vaccines"", plus, we have those who think (assume) that since they have received the ""vaccine"", they are perfectly safe (declining to read about effects of obesity, diabetes, etc.).  Be not quick to condemn those who have questions & concerns as I would remind everyone that long term effects of these ""vaccines"" are still unknown."
2021-03-16 12:28:26,"I think Biden's point is well taken:  it's far more likely that folks reticent about the vaccines will listen to the stories of their their local community/friends than they will to those of a political leader.  My suspicion is that messages from major sports figures, and other media sorts would be even more effective, especially as they could be more easily directed towards target audiences."
2021-03-16 11:47:07,"Republicans have become the party of ignorance and fear.  Refusing the covid-19 vaccine on ""principle"" is amazingly foolish and a deathly decision for our nation.  The virus mutates and will infect more people killing as it moves through this paradise of the unvaccinated.  I cannot understand."
2021-03-16 12:27:39,"Interesting that the party of the ignorant and gullible is claiming the right to refuse to have themselves vaccinated. 
Maybe this will open their eyes to the idea of women having the right to choose what to do with their bodies. 
Irony can be amusing."
2021-03-16 12:29:29,"Anyone refusing a vaccine should be entered into a database, which is shared with every insurance company and Medicare. Should that person contract coronavirus, insurance companies should refuse to cover their medical expenses. It won’t protect others in their midst, but it may dissuade them from refusing to be inoculated against the virus."
2021-03-16 12:24:12,"I'm already fully vaccinated. Do not confuse ideology with vaccine reticence. My cleaners are a lovely young Black couple, who run their own cleaning service. They asked me what getting the vaccine was like and I told them just like getting a flu shot. They told me, and I'll quote here-""Black people do not get flu shots."" I'm not sure if that's accurate or not, but if there's truth to it that will be a bigger issue. Because here in our senior community there were plenty of Trump signs and plenty of Biden signs and all are quite vocal about having been vaccinated."
2021-03-16 11:51:01,"Biden's success so far is because he did the right things during this crisis. He should continue to focus on doing the right things and not be distracted by petty politics. Personally, I want him to remain laser focused on saving lives from Covid 19 and providing financial relief to our struggling fellow citizens. Equally important is protecting the nation from enemies domestic and foreign. As for immigration policy, it will be a Herculean task to cope with issues caused by former Presidential and congressional inactions and missteps at our southern border. Biden can start with DACA (Dreamers Act) and also strongly enforcing E-verify.  And of course we can be humane with children - but we must be firm in our protections of our own citizens by keeping out and/or sequestering those infected by the novel coronavirus. Biden can be one of our best leaders if he doesn't try to be perfect and stays focused."
2021-03-16 12:02:01,"President Biden has the right approach. Let the local officials and experts try and convince the public because he will not get any help from Trump or the Republican leadership. It obvious that Trump and the Republican leadership is doing everything they can to tarnish Biden with the hope of him failing. The American public's health is secondary to Trump regaining power. If not in the presidency then in complete control of the Republican party. Unfortunately the Trump followers cannot see how they are being used and what's best for them. If it were not for the fact that they will keep the covid virus alive I would say go ahead and skip the vaccine at your own peril, but as usual what the Republicans do affects innocent people that are not playing politics."
2021-03-16 12:16:56,"I had to terminate nearly all my normal activities during most of the epidemic . I wore my mask, kept my social distances and mostly stayed inside my home. I had personal risk factors and I did not want to infect my friends and family. I did my part to an extreme.I was angry about the people who would not follow any rules because of ""personal freedom"". I am fully vaccinated now thank heavens. 
When there is excess vaccine and multiple appointments are unfilled, I will express my personal freedom quite rapidly return to normal life without the mask etc. with little concern for people who get their medical information from facebook and refuse the vaccine.You still a have a right to be misinformed in this country. People make bad choices their entire life and they will have to live with the consequences. I'm beginning to tire of stories who refuse the vaccine. How about a few stories about the real freedom of not having to worry about having to be admitted to a  hospital with covid after a vaccination. Older people or people with pre-existing conditions with vaccinations who can now live near normally. Hopefully the only part of covid for me to deal with will be a yearly booster shot for variants which I will take as soon as available."
2021-03-16 12:26:55,"I have this perception that for some conservatives, anything embraced by democrats, no matter how sensible, is a potential political issue which they feel must be countered. The thinking might be that a successful vaccination program will look good for Biden, who for some stole the election, so why be a part of its possible success? As with masks and the election for these people, there was first the decision to believe something followed by the creation of unsupported reasoning. Might this reluctance on the part of Trump supporters to get vaccinated be a replay of the idea that anything supported by the democrats must be inherently wrong￼? If Trump might influence this thinking, could it be best for our entire country to put politics aside and seek his help?"
2021-03-16 12:30:36,"trump touts credit for ""warp speed"" vaccine effort, but does not support or promote its distribution.

Kind of a two-faced philosophy that continues to hinder our battle against the pandemic.

I would like to think trump can't have it both ways, but evidently he does."
2021-03-16 11:46:07,"It amazes me that the Republican leadership won't lift a finger to help their own constituencies.  From stimulus, to vaccinations, to expanding Medicaid in their own states - they deny their own voters the very stuff of life that they take for granted back in Washington D.C."

2021-03-16 12:33:20,"Haven’t Republicans caused enough COVID problems and damage?  

For crying out loud, stop threatening the rest of us!  We want to get on with our lives and need cooperation.  That’s not too much to ask.  

So sick of looking at Republican no maskers who could care less if this old lady or anyone gets sick, dies, or whatever.  So tired of making life better for them by playing by the rules, and having them scorn.  We’re worn out with begging and pleading with those who call “hoax” to just make this a safer America by doing very simple humane things.  

So sick of the divide that costs lives!"

They would have to stand in line with other people. Probably have to wear a mask. Dum!

 The shot may hurt. who needs pain. There could be pain and chills the next day. Especially after the second shot. Who needs that. More wasted time recovering.
And, a second line to get the second shot. No way!
So, ""smarter"" to let the ""libs"" have all this pain and nonsense and wait for herd immunity.

2021-03-16 12:40:35,"Talk about politicizing the vaccine.  Pre-election, Kamala Harris stated she would not take a vaccine if Trump recommended it - regardless of what public health officials recommend.  Cuomo would not let any vaccine approved during Trump's administration used in his state until his oh so capable public health experts (nursing homes, homes for the developmentally disabled all being forced to take in COVID patients) studied it first.
Now you have an administration that states they are starting with nothing - no vaccine, no plan - despite the millions already vaccinated before Biden took office (Biden included); absolute refusal to credit the Trump administration for the steps they took to facilitate development and now conservatives are being blamed for vaccine hesitancy?  Sure, this is the unity president.
I live in a pretty conservative community and one of the hottest topics on its Facebook page is where and how is the best place to get an appointment for the vaccine."

Is it simply that to get people to believe in Trump's BIg Lie and all the other lies, and that government is oppressive and evil, is worth the lives of thousands of innocents? 

Spoke to my brother yesterday, who is a Republican that buys into all of the above. Facts, objectivity, global view, common sense... nothing penetrates. The call ended with me being sick to my stomach. It is as if he had joined the Taliban. That he represents at  least 30% of our country frightens me. 

Trump is not going to be a stand-up guy by the way. He will remain small, mean, and nasty. That most Republicans still think he is the best ever, and is right now our rightful president, frightens me. These newly-minted Taliban want to take over our country."
2021-03-16 11:30:47,"Trump has always been a self-serving coward. I will remember his legacy for how many people he killed and the complicity of the republican representatives, their constituency, and the lying right-wing media.

The Dam has bust on using logic with the followers of Trump. People who still believe Biden stole the election are going to swayed by logic to get Vaccinated? Trump and his wife got the vaccine in the shadows and cannot bring himself to tell his followers to do likewise. School kids are required to get vaccinated to go to school. There are travel destinations that require vaccinations. You are not allowed to drive a vehicle without wearing a seat belt and having a drivers license. After everyone is offered the vaccine there should be requirements to travel ,attend school and such. No shot card No Play. Really not rocket science. Save us all the violating your rights rhetoric you can think of. You have to right to get sick but you and yours don't have the right to make me and mine sick.

At some point the rest of the country needs to move on. We can’t keep begging Republicans to do the right thing. It’s like having a self-destructive family member. You never stop loving them but there comes a point when you cut them off. For me that point was on January 6th, which was the equivalent of an addicted nephew forcibly stealing money from grandma.

That last one was a rhetorical question, of course. We have some clues why: 1) He downplayed the virus during his term so it would not reflect badly on him. 2) He likes to promote a macho image (remember his stance on masks?) 3) He plays into his supporters anti-science and anti-expertise beliefs and skepticism, and doesn't want to appear to change course. 4) If he wanted to promote vaccination, he wouldn't have taken one in secret, without his usual fanfare and publicity at promoting causes he likes. 5) Seriously, who thinks he would want to do anything to make Biden's job easier, even if it means his supporters remaining in harm's way?"

As a healthy 54-year-old who is not obese, doesn't smoke, doesn't have any underlying health conditions and doesn't work in any of the ""essential worker"" fields, I still don't qualify. Very frustrating since there are plenty of people who fit all of the above categories who don't want to get the vaccine.

First, you can keep your job but will not be allowed to interact with other people in person and if you do you have to wear PPE, forever.

If we have learned anything about the Trump Republican party base, it is that they lie to pollsters about their support of Trump. Likewise, I think it likely they are lying about the vaccine, believing an admission of support for the vaccine being a tacit admission of the lies and and incompetence of the Trump administration in mitigating the pandemic. But the Trump Republican party will vote against the Covid relief bill and be first in line to put their hand out for the money, and the Trump Republican party faithful will lie about the vaccine and be first in line to get a shot when their turn comes."

2021-03-16 12:48:48,"Just one of many examples of the alternate universe Trump promoted either actively, or with his silence. He knows getting vaccinated is the right answer. But he also knows many of his supporters don't think so. No different than telling the people attacking the Capital on January 6th to be peaceful but he loved them. Biden shouldn't give Trump the satisfaction of being asked for help. Let him sit out there and do nothing."
2021-03-16 12:49:25,"Some people do not like to take vaccine based on their religious and personal views. Leave them alone, it is their freedom of choice.  You don't need everybody to take the vaccine to have herd immunity. If some people do not take it, it put them at risk, not others who who took the vaccine."
2021-03-16 12:52:38,"1. People who believe COVID is a hoax also believe they don’t need a vaccination for something that’s not real - except for Trump, of course. 

2. People who believe the vaccinations were rushed are relying on “the way we’ve always done it” thinking.  Change does not equal progress to some; to them, change equals we’re doing something wrong otherwise why do we have to change. 

Same group that questions or denies science. Fear is driven by not understanding, which is the common thread of both groups. 

At this point, I think vaccinations should be offered to all, first come first served.  A way to get numbers as high as possible in the fastest way. 

My and others experiences showed the system for receiving the shot is smooth and efficient. They could handle it."
2021-03-16 12:45:12,"If Republicans aren't willing to get the vaccine, then why is Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis bending over backward to send the vaccine into GOP strongholds? Oh, they're taking it, but just aren't willing to admit it. Like their fearless leader Mr. Trump."
2021-03-16 12:56:03,I'm dumbfounded by anyone refusing the vaccine.  Whether it's Trump supporters or Black folks - I give neither a pass for ignoring the science.

2021-03-16 12:57:12,"Seven cases of blood clotting were reported in Germany following the administration of 1.6M AstraZeneca doses in the country. Even though the number is extremely small, that's precisely the fuel the ""deniers"" have been waiting for to justify their ignorance towards the vaccine. Trump is a toxin so any involvement is sure to backfire. Neville Chamberlain thought he could persuade the Third Reich to join the world community and we saw how well that worked out.

Unfortunately, the republican party has been taken over by narcissists whose only goal is power and campaign contributions. Enlightenment is coming thru churches which are advocating vaccine so families can reunite.

But involving Trump is the worst possible idea. Remember the slogan, ""everything Trump touches turns to ....."". Four years of Trump was four years too many. Hopefully, the prosecutions headed his way will weaken his chokehold on the republican party."
2021-03-16 12:51:50,"This situation is spinning out of control!  Everyday I hear reports that vaccine injections are going up.  Where? No one I know can get an appointment.  As a high risk patient, I struggle daily, trying to get an appointment.  My physicians are at Northwestern Hospital.  Yesterday I contacted them again, inquiring about when and where I could get a vaccine.  They told me I should wait for my “invitation” to receive a vaccine.  

Last night my friend, who is COMPLETELY healthy, under 65, and a business executive called to tell me has has received an invitation from the hospital to be vaccinated.  This is insane!!! I get 7 hour IVIG Infusions from them every three weeks to help my immune system function properly, I’m a multiple sclerosis for 20yrs and they will not give me an “invitation” to be vaccinated.  This system has been a complete failure.   I feel completely  abandoned by the  very people who freely charge my insurance $12,000 every three weeks for my care,  their website says they hv vaccinated 51,493 patient/employees and issued 202,198 “invitations”.  What are they doing with all of the extra doses?  Because they sure aren’t going to their high risk patients.  They claim they are distributing in a fair and equitable way.  I don’t see that happening ANYWHERE in Chicago.   I hv accepted that I won’t get a vaccine.  I’m sick of trying and I’m exhausted by this whole thing."
2021-03-16 12:58:51,"Oppositional Defiant Disorder seems to be a way to define GOP behaviors. Their refusal to see their racism, evidenced by Johnson's latest gaslight that white privilege styled insurrection, violence and death of police is not really a riot but would be if Blacks were the perpetrators.  Also, other evidence of this Republican mental health disorder is their refusal to look at the science or listen to our very smart, educated and experienced public health officials as they promote Covid vaccinations that would get us all to herd immunity sooner so that we can return to our more normal lives.

There is no rational basis for this group behavior. Their racism is now overt along with their refusal to follow the science that can potentially harm the rest of us.

Voting them out of office can show them that racism of any kind will not be tolerated.  As for the vaccination, the use of a Covid inoculation passport that will give those inoculated access to air travel, hotels, restaurants, schools and other public gathering locations may be the only way to reinforce the importance of getting the Covid vaccine.  The GOP refuses to examine what they are doing so the rest of us must take action to make sure that their gaslighting is minimized as we move forward to a better future."
2021-03-16 12:59:22,Reality Check why people so quick to point to those who represent us deplorables for our problems? Alot can be done to improve health of people in general an all of wild life of planet. Vaccinating people an not correcting whats enabling the covid huge mistake. Whole list of good things can be done like getting all fossile fuel cars an trucks off road an end the burning of bio fuels. Build hyperloop an end use fossile fuels in air planes. List goes on an on with little no action in washinton. We can kick can down road but covid will just keep mutating  choice is ours we have techolgy question is will we use it now

2021-03-16 12:53:56,"Again there's no accountability for lying and disinformation by Trumpets. Lying seems to be the Republican way. Employers should require their workers to be vaccinated by June 1. Certainly anyone who works for the public, like the police, should be vaccinated or goodbye. When it's possible for children to be vaccinated, if you refuse, you can homeschool your children. As for the Fox liars for hire, vaccine makers should sue and Congress should invite Rupert Murdoch and the other liars-for-dollars in for hearings and the DOJ should start investigating their holdings and methods. We should publicize all the Republican liars, like Trump, who got their vaccines in secret. Democrats need to start sharpening their knives instead of  playing nice with wolves. The American people paid for the vaccine and will pay for the rescue plan. We don't need reality deniers and people who would rather trust their Facebook friends rather than any evidence based on fact."

2021-03-16 12:58:50,"So here is the really bad news — a few facts mean that the virus and vaccine cycle is here to stay:

1. The USA will never get to 85 or 90 percent vaccination, between reluctance to get inoculated and logistical challenges, 70 percent is a realistic goal in a year.

2. The virus mutates and the vaccines need to be tweaked.

3. The virus is global, even at 100 percent vaccination in the US new strains will keep coming at us.

This all adds up to one thing, your annual COVID shot is here to stay and so is COVID."
2021-03-16 12:58:25,"So we are supposed to be concern with people who don't want to be vaccinated? Have at it. To paraphrase Mencken ""nobody ever went broke underestimating the intelligence of the American public"".  Easy to see why."
2021-03-16 12:57:16,"It’s difficult to imagine the ignorance that exists amongst us. It’s not just Trump’s influence, because these very conservative groups and thoughts existed long before he was born. Of course, the fact that he was vaccinated secretly and now does absolutely nothing to help the cause shows tacit complicity with the deniers, and this will go a long way towards prolonging the pandemic, keeping our economy down, keeping unemployment high, and thinning their ranks through virus-related deaths. If they don’t fear dying from what is now a preventable illness, then they will get what they’re asking for. As for the majority of Americans, vaccination rates are improving, and the long term picture is good. Maybe a cemetery plot should be included with every MAGA cap sold."
2021-03-16 12:56:16,"Probably a good decision to simply call on Trump to make a PSA, which would be a controlled message.  He won't do it, but that is as far as I would go in trying to ""enlist"" him.

Beyond that it is risking far more political and public-health damage for Biden to give an opening to Trump -- who finished his presidency by inciting a riot -- to get any further back into the national conversation."
2021-03-16 13:00:21,"Campaign that if some Republicans don’t believe in vaccinations, then fine, it’s just another way for Progressives to gain an advantage at the ballot box. I’d be curious if this would be persuasive!"

2021-03-16 13:11:41,"Biden must be bold enough to shame all republicans including President Trump. Most of conservatives are supporting Biden's plan secretly but  they promote different things publicly. For example, Trump family was vaccinated secretly in WH but never  said anything publicly. is not thing to be shamed boldly? Senator R. Johnson is another example. He hides Capitol riot culprit buy promotes slogans against MLM and Antifa though there is no proof of any kind. Senator McConnell is another example saying something in the senate floor but voting the opposite. In my opinion, Democrats must find a way to shame them all. Republicans did not keep any room to show empathy and gentlemen ship."
2021-03-16 13:11:21,Thank the GOPers for not getting vaccinates and go the spring breaks and other breaks and experience the virus and oxygen treatment so there will be fewer of  them in the House and Senate sessions making it easier getting his agenda passed!
2021-03-16 13:12:13,"I suspect that Biden, et al, have run the numbers and figured out they can get to their goals without Trump: thus, the exercise is a win-win for them if they don't use him. The great irony to me is that Biden's ""work across the aisle"" moniker would become both real and lasting if he TRIED to get Trump on board: either way, Biden would be in a win-win situation. If Trump says no, Biden gets to say 'I tried'; if Trump agrees, Biden is the great political healer. Oh, BTW, America would get a win, too!"
2021-03-16 13:19:57,"I don't understand this obsession with people who choose to abstain from vaccination.  They pose a threat to all the rest of us.  If citizens had the individual freedom to protect themselves from those who are not vaccinated, then most of the threat could be eliminated.

If people had the freedom to protect themselves, then companies like airlines, restaurants, amusement parks, hotels, and a myriad of other kinds of businesses would be forced by the marketplace to refuse service to customers who were not vaccinated.  And, a great many companies would be forced by the marketplace to refuse to hire or continue employing any employee who was not vaccinated.

That would solve about 80% of the problem.  The remaining 20% of the problem are the government employees since politicians have long embraced the philosophy that their rights to lifetime jobs and their selfish financial interests are more important than the public interest."
2021-03-16 13:16:53,"Trump played down the threat of this virus while getting the best medical care for himself.  He lied about the dangers of the virus early on because he didn't want to admit what a bad idea it was to decimate our pandemic response team.   Now he tried to keep his vaccinations private.   If he cared about his supporters he would tell them to get vaccinated, but he knows that would put him at odds with the fake not fact world of QAnon. 
President Biden should continue to work for the country, and eventually make vaccines a requirement for air travel and other public transportation.  Let insurance companies charge extra for those who refuse vaccination. 
There is no reason for President Biden to reach out to Trump who already skipped one opportunity after another to help."
2021-03-16 13:03:36,"Once again the rudderless party of chaos and division is playing a role of complicity through silence.  Where is the voice of Congressional Republicans?

It's a wonderful opportunity to mute their culpability in enabling Trump to ignore the pandemic and  club the Democrats over their heads in the 2022 mid-term elections if Biden's efforts should fall short and a fourth surge take place with possibly more lethal mutations of the coronavirus.  

It’s as though Gracchus from the movie, “Gladiator” said:

“… [Republicans are] the mob. Conjure magic for them and they'll be distracted. Take away their freedom and still they'll roar. The beating heart of Rome is not the marble of the senate; it's the sand of the coliseum. [Republicans will] bring them death - and they will love them for it.”

Unfortunately, the GOP doesn’t ‘believe’ in the vaccine, because it hurts their messaging about COVID19 being a hoax.

So much for all the unity."
2021-03-16 13:31:38,"Several points. It hard to believe that the Biden administration would want Trump to promote vaccinations. It would give him notoriety and a platform that would increase his visibility. Something Biden would not want. The messaging of side effects of the vaccine has been front and center of the MSM. There is a reason drug manufacturers put untoward effects of their products in small print. Israel to their credit has put individuals who’ve had Covid-19 at the back of the line, and haven’t vaccinated them yet believing they are an important segment with natural immunity. It would be interesting to know what the vaccine hesitancy is in the over 65 age group"

Review the question put to Harris near the end of the VP debate.  Also, there is a significant percentage of Blacks that don’t trust the vaccine and they, by and large, are not Republicans.  This is a problem Biden helped create."
2021-03-16 13:11:56,I speculate that acceptance of the vaccine is high among independents who left the Republican party over Iraq (like myself) and over Trump.
2021-03-16 13:04:19,"I am going to go with Dr. Fauci on this issue. He has put his ego aside and tolerated Trump's insults time after time to advance the public good. The administration should reach out to Trump and his associates to promote the vaccine. If Trump declines, nothing has been lost; we tried. Although Trump's administration fell far short in the COVID response, they were in power when the vaccine program was developed and deserve some credit. 
The US should follow the example of Israel and create a ""Green Pass"" system which allows persons with proven immunity from documented COVID infection or immunization to go to gyms, concerts and bars. This is not punishment for those not immunized but prudent public health policy. How about favored seating on the airlines. Although I know that there has been very little COVID transmission on planes, wouldn't you rather sit next to someone who has been immunized? And should those who refuse the vaccine still get those stimulus checks? 
Those who are refusing immunization are not taking the action needed to protect their friends and community from illness, death and the economic consequences of COVID. And these COVID refuseniks are freeloading off of our immunity. ""If everyone else is immune, why should I take the vaccine?"""
2021-03-16 13:22:01,"As in 1918, people are emotionally hijacked and their resulting behavior is irrational.  Rational arguments won't convince hijacked people to get vaccinated.  They simply can't hear them.  We need to find the adult equivalent of Mr Rogers' Neighborhood to give people like this the emotional space they need to calm themselves and settle down and come back to their senses.  It would help if Fox News and other conservative propaganda outlets would stop broadcasting lies about the vaccines.  Perhaps Congress could direct the FCC could help by declaring such speech harmful and not protected by the First Amendment, or if that is unconstitutional, maybe we could sue them for all they're worth.  That seemed to work with the voting machine lies."
2021-03-16 13:38:17,President Biden does not need an ounce of help from Donald Trump. He is doing an excellent job so far with the help of trusted advisors and Anthony Fauci. And why would he need any help from Trump? Look at the disasterous way Trump mishandled the onset of the virus and pretty much until the end of his time in office he created chaos and misunderstandings. All he wants is credit for Operation Warp Speed. He didn't even care enough about his supporters to publicly get vaccinated by instead he and Melania did it in private. Trump is someone who just needs to go away. No need to reach out to him for anything. Period.
2021-03-16 13:06:24,"Interesting, my personal experience suggests that a lot of the anti-vaxxers are progressives living in wealthy enclaves who let their personal unsubstantiated opinions that vaccines cause autism etc cloud any scientific facts.

Not so much for my protection but for the protection of others."
2021-03-16 13:26:16,Interesting to note that those who refuse to be vaccinated because of distrust of government seem to have no problem with accepting their economic stimulus checks.
2021-03-16 13:06:23,"Have we learned yet that polls are wholly unreliable?!
Here's my anecdotal rebuttal: I live in Harris County (Houston). I spent weeks and weeks trying to find an appointment for my 80 year old father to get his first shot. He was on every waiting list I could find. Even as local grocery and pharmacy chains got the vaccine, appointments were snapped up in an instant. CVS's site went down a more than a few times because of traffic. Finally our county had another mega event at several stadiums across the county and we finally got him his vaccine 6 weeks after they started becoming available.
There are democrats in Texas of course, despite the broad red brush we're all painted with, but I highly doubt all of those qualifying so far- the over 65, now 50, the preexisting condition qualifiers, the frontline workers (and this is very broadly defined under the state guidelines) are democrats.  For both CVS and H‑E‑B websites, they show you location in the state and availability should you want to drive. Appointments were always full booked too in the Panhandle, the West, in the Valley, and in East Texas-all areas typically deeply deeply red. 

Maybe we should just have exit polls at the vaccination sites instead?"
2021-03-16 13:26:16,"""Mr. Trump got his vaccine in secret before leaving office . . .  during Mr. Biden’s inauguration, he had not yet disclosed that he had been vaccinated.""

I do not find the former president receiving the vaccine strange or bizarre, but keeping it a secret, especially from his fellow GOP pals is weird.

I find President Biden's efforts in pushing all Americans to receive this vaccine as part of his due diligence as this country's leader.  He said he was going to be a president for ALL Americans, not Red ones or Blue ones.  At least this is a president trying to push an agenda that would be more beneficial to people than not.

I think one of the many problems lies with perception.  How many Americans still don't believe in ANY vaccinations, especially for their children?  

I don't think it's so much only Republicans who are dead set against the COVID vaccination, but a lot of people across the board.

Heck, I never received the flu shot until last year, and that's only because I came down with the flu the prior year and was sicker than I have ever been.  Getting such a severe case of the flu made me a true believer in the flu shot.

If people don't believe in getting the flu shot or any other vaccination, good luck trying to persuade or convince them otherwise.  These are probably many of the same individuals who don't believe in wearing face masks or keeping a healthy social distance either."
2021-03-16 13:26:48,"Grassroots messaging is the way to go. Church and local community leaders have the most pull here as they are usually trusted in small communities. If Trump truly cared about people he would have spent some of the money he recently raised on his own commercial. He has zero interest in improving people's lives right now because his power thrives in chaos. If anything, republican officials who have sided with Trump in the past should be reaching out to their districts to improve vaccine rates."
2021-03-16 13:22:09,"How about past a certain date when everyone has had the vaccine available to them, no more federal financial aid to those being hospitalized for Covid who cannot prove they have been previously vaccinated.  If Republicans want the freedom to put the rest of the population at risk by flaunting masks and refusing the vaccine, then they can have the freedom to pay their own way when they end up in the hospital."
2021-03-16 13:04:56,"Receiving the vaccine is the least anyone can do for themselves and for the more vulnerable in their family and community. For any politician or political group to be associated with an anti vaccination cause during a pandemic is self-destructive. Particularly when the available vaccines have been thoroughly tested. The CDC numbers indicate that 71.1 Million people have received at least one dose. It is well known by now that the more and the faster people are vaccinated, the better the chance of cornering the virus and of preventing it from mutating. As if the death count is not shocking enough, experts assert that long after the health effects of the virus are forgotten, the economic impact will be remembered. The rational question is: does all of this leave any room for partisan disagreement on the need for rapid vaccination? Politicians, pundits, experts, etc who publicly discourage covid vaccination should also commit publicly to never receive a vaccine and to never allow people under their care to be vaccinated."

2021-03-16 13:30:23,"I have long felt that President Biden would need the enlisted help of respected Republicans to help with the divisiveness gridlock in America. I think George and Laura Bush would be perfect for the job. The extremist republicans will never be convinced to follow ""Democrat science"", but that leaves many millions who may be persuaded by their last non Trump leader. As defeating covid-19 is the number one challenge in the country today, I suggest a task force led by former president Bush to target Republican communities all across the country and stage pro-vaccination events, perhaps with vaccinators right there on site."
2021-03-16 13:39:20,"How about publishing a list of prominent conservative politicians and religious leaders who have accepted the vaccine? I think when rank and file Republicans see that their leaders have had the vaccine, they will follow their leaders. They are good at that."

Many of the narratives favored by Democrats and their media champions have been proved false: that lockdowns are effective, that blue states managed better than red states, that masks mandates are the key preventive measure (over good communication, distance, ventilation and personal responsibility), that the US death rate was all Trump's fault and is far worse than all other countries (actually, similar to other large, complex, diverse and open countries), that Florida is reckless and Cuomo prescient, that motorcycle rallies were spread events but not the summer protests, that much of the recent stimulus bill favored blue states and traditionally Democratic constituencies was passed under the guise of being Covid relief, etc.

Now, Democrats and the media ask why do we have challenges in communicating about vaccines?

In terms of the survey itself, it would be far more meaningful to conduct a survey after someone is vaccinated, similar to an exit poll, asking about political affiliation: what are the percentages by political affiliation or other beliefs and is there bias from the overall population of the locality/state. This would actually be accurate and useful for policy making, especially as age eligibility is expanded. Likely there are localized issues, like rural vs. city, but less purely political dynamic as reported here."
2021-03-16 13:59:05,"The only reason the anti-vaccination movement enjoys any traction is that we have been spoiled.  It seems that as the living memory of smallpox, pertussis, polio, measles, tetanus and a whole host of other communicable diseases fade, the anti-vaccination movement becomes stronger.  This is not a coincidence.

In my darker moments, I contemplate a study where one takes a sampling of people from the anti-vaccination movement,  isolate them on some desert island, and then use one of those frozen vials stored in Atlanta or Moscow to turn smallpox loose.  It would be interesting to learn if their views on the evils of vaccination changed under those circumstances."
2021-03-16 13:40:08,"Why was the vaccine good for Trump and his family, but not for anyone else?"
2021-03-16 13:35:46,"It strikes me there's a certain degree of Darwinian karma in members of the disgraced former president's cult not taking vaccination seriously. Unfortunately, they infect not only themselves but the rest of the world as well."
2021-03-16 13:58:11,Is it bad that I sort of hope these anti-vaccination types just die of the disease already?

2021-03-16 13:26:56,This is Biden's problem as the title of this piece  proclaims only as far as he cares about themselves.  For some people stupidity is as prevalent as the virus its self and well intentioned people will not fix what others choose to do to themselves or others unless we pass laws that require the vaccination which we are not about to do.  But at some point society must decide whether it will pay for hospitalizations for those who put themselves and others in such peril.   Thank goodness that there is probably enough people in this world who will choose to do the right thing and choose the vaccination.
2021-03-16 13:42:31,"President Biden stayed in the press conference, have these no vac talk to family and doctors.  He is saying what we all know, Trump does not care about anyone else but Donald Trump.  If he can raise the amount of Covid by maga not getting vaccinated.  He wins.   They die, they get sick, and it will be a financial hardship for his followers.  When they get Covid maga people will blame dem, immigrates, black and brown people.  This is the GOP membership now.  

Giving Trump air is a waste of time and energy.   Please stop thinking he has some grip on people, it is just a blame circle that has no facts and is just gossip."
2021-03-16 14:06:37,"How about this: If you don't get vaccinated, insurance won't cover costs for treatment if you get Covid-19. You will need proof of vaccination to board a plane, a cruise ship, to get a government job. Obviously, there would be exceptions for people with medically diagnosed immune problems or other medical reasons why they shouldn't be vaccinated."
2021-03-16 14:09:01,"As a senior, I've been eligible for a vaccine for two months but have not been able to schedule one at a location acceptable to me.   More groups are eligible every month, yet few appointments are available period.  Do we even know if all those 75+ who are homebound, single, with maybe just a landline, have been inoculated before we open the gates to everyone else?

My point is the anti-vaccine sentiment is not the only problem.  The poor rollout to date has been underreported.  I'm tempted to join the anti-vaccine camp out of sheer frustration--as an act of protest against a system that is neglecting to serve its most vulnerable citizens."
2021-03-16 14:19:22,"How about actively promoting the data that clearly show a relatively small number of Covid in a population of people already vaccinated. Probably this data exists, but I haven't seen it actively promoted by the press or gov't. The lack of such data may strongly suggest that vaccine's efficiency is a myth."
2021-03-16 13:25:42,"I've been thinking  that we should divide our statistics for those who die from this virus into two categories, those who tried but lost the battle and those who are ""refuseniks"", no maskers and 'smarter' than vaccines."
2021-03-16 14:14:47,Message to Biden: Don’t hand Trump a bullhorn for any reason. It will not go well. Trump is an inveterate demagogue and reactionary. Public interest is the further thing from his mind.
2021-03-16 13:40:03,"Biden should seek the means that he can to get to the proportions vaccinated as he can. If Trump can be enlisted, great. But Trump cannot focus on the public service angle without drifting into his incessant whining and denigration of other people for long."
2021-03-16 13:26:46,"I figure the same people who don't want to believe the data on covid-19 vaccine effectiveness also are likely to think the covid-19 virus is just like the flu. So...Given the efforts in this country to mitigate the spread of the covid-19 virus we find that 1 out of every 600 Americans died from the virus and at a minimum 30 million were infected and yet those interventions resulted in a ""minimal"" amount of flu cases.
<a href=""https://www.cdc.gov/flu/weekly/usmap.htm"" target=""_blank"">https://www.cdc.gov/flu/weekly/usmap.htm</a>
 This should dispel the argument that covid-19 is just like the flu because the data demonstrate that it was much more virulent and contagious."
2021-03-16 13:35:27,"What a contradiction the Republicans are. How may Republicans Senators and Representatives have actually gotten the vaccine ? A lot have, a majority. Then their followers do not get the vaccine because they don't trust their government but they trust their representatives enough to follow them down the rabbit hole of mistrust, lies and conspiracies. My relatives say if they get sick with Covid and die then its Gods will. But they never think for a minute that maybe God made the vaccine, mask and guidelines to prevent them from getting sick and dying. What primitive thinking."
2021-03-16 13:13:07,The ultimate conflict for trump; promote the vaccine to get credit or cater to his ignorant MAGA base. Tipping the scale is that there is no money to be made by the former.

2021-03-16 13:45:55,"Accountability
￼Regardless of President Clinton’s apology to the survivors of the syphilis study and their descendants in 1997, and the apologies from the scientific community about the disrespect and unethical treatment of African-Americans in science for decades, I think very little of substance has been done to communicate sincere ownership of the harm that has been done. 
I think it’s time for another authentic apology and perhaps reparations in order to make it clear that mostly white science and government get it and are willing to take responsibility for the harm that has been done.￼￼
Underneath the concerns that are being voiced in the African-American community about the safety of the Covid vaccine I hear a degree of resentment about the betrayal of their trust and vulnerability by the white establishment. Makes sense to me.￼ 
It might also be useful to take a look at the racial and gender composition of institutional review boards￼ at every level of government and in the medical community, especially at the national institutes for health.￼"

Imagine a public service announcement by Trump, Pence, McCarthy, Hannity, and Carlson promoting the COVID-19 vaccine to the millions of loyal (sycophantic, in reality) followers.

Unfortunately, when pigs fly."

The fact is, one of the few times he has addressed the public since leaving office, and where it was covered by some of the press (the CPAC convention), he urged people to get the vaccine."
2021-03-16 14:18:58,Diehard Trump supporters have presented a danger to the democratic principles and proper functioning of our government.  Now those of them who refuse to get vaccinated present a danger to our physical health as well.  All in the name of FREEDOM.  Deplorable(s).

2021-03-16 14:01:54,"Trump owes his life to the best drugs, treatment and an army of doctors; resources his followers don't have. The fact that he is willing to throw them under the bus to promote his conspiracy base tells you all you need to know about enlisting him."
2021-03-16 14:07:34,"Many commenters are basically saying, ""let those who refuse to get  vaccinated live with the consequences of their decision.""

That sentiment is just as ignorant and damaging as refusing the vaccine.  We are a year into the pandemic, and it is clear that we are all in this together.  Those refusing vaccinations, to mask-up, etc. are not just damaging themselves, but all of us.

By infecting others, by delaying/undermining the day herd immunity will arrive, and by spurring and spreading new variants that will render the current vaccine less and less effective.

A ""return to normalcy"" is not guaranteed under the best of circumstances and, if it were, the anti-vaxers, the anti-maskers and others are  pushing it further and further into the future."
2021-03-16 13:37:18,"The ""one-time president' should be ignored as much as possible.  He lives on publicity of any kind.  His record is that of a consistent liar and there is no evidence of his ever acting in the interests of anything but himself and his ""brand"".

2021-03-16 14:04:33,This hesitancy won’t help me get the shot because only 4 people in my precinct voted for Trump.  I should go to a deep red area if the state.  Let GOPers sit it out until the end.
2021-03-16 13:56:17,"Of course if we can’t barbecue together on July 4th it’ll be Trump’s fault. Everything bad for the next 4 years is. Never mind the VP’s prior screed about not trusting any Trump vaccine and the potential resultant effect on the fact that a number of people of color don’t want the vaccine. Biden’s talks a good game about unity and personal responsibility. He and his gang are quick to take credit for things he has not had a real hand in, but fails to take responsibility for his and his administration’s mistakes. Compassionate hypocrisy."
2021-03-16 13:57:08,"A lot of people are being really just plain stupid about refusing to be vaccinated for Covid and other diseases. Let me pose a simple question. If you were bitten by a stray dog that could not be located or a bat that could not be caught and tested, would you forego the rabies vaccine? Probably not unless you are truly foolish and want to risk dying in a really horrible manner from a disease that is usually fatal. There are less serious diseases like shingles for which effective vaccines are available. Ask someone who has suffered from the months of pain and discomfort of shingles if they would have traded a couple of pinpricks from getting that vaccine for the misery of this sickness. Really – the only people who should not receive the Covid vaccine are those who have a true medical condition that might cause the vaccine to do more harm than good. BTW – back in 2006 I was bat bitten and went for the post exposure rabies inoculation. That was a series of five shots in the arm over a couple of weeks and was not the big deal that it used to be (a series of very painful shots in the belly but still better than the alternative)."

2021-03-16 13:59:59,I have a trumpian friend who is going to be 75 years old and will not get the vaccine. He believes that the attack on the capitol was by leftists posing as trump supporters to make them look bad. He believes that the current hike in gasoline prices is caused by the cancellation of the Keystone pipe line. And on and on. Any attempt at a fact based discussion on virtually any topic is met with outsized anger. There is absolutely no effort made to even evaluate any possible alternative. Today’s republiklan party is dependent upon the willful ignorance of its followers and a blind devotion to the cause. It’s cult like indoctrination convinces its members to continually vote and act against their own interests. I’m at a total loss as to how to break the spell before the country is lost.
2021-03-16 14:11:04,"Trump got his vaccine before the vaccines were available to anyone including essential workers. I imagine he kept it secret because he clearly used his influence to access life saving science before anyone else. 

Trump is a contrarian. He won’t join anyone to amplify a message. When Trump does anything “good” it is to look magnanimous while secretly holding someone in debt to his favor."
2021-03-16 13:47:28,"Trump will never recommended, promote or endorse vaccination. He'd have to admit that there is a deadly pandemic and that it would serve the greater good during an administration which he believes should be his. 

Should all those folks who refuse to be vaccinated eventually be convinced to get one we would reach herd immunity which would reflect positively on the current administration, another reason preventing Trump from advising his supporters to be vaccinated. 

Altruism and selflessness do not seem to be traits of the former one term, twice impeached narcissistic so-called leader of the free world."

2021-03-16 14:06:53,"Trump made at least one incredible political blunder and that was not advancing his administrations role in the vaccine development. They called it warp speed. Trumps dilemma was in fact a self inflected wound that may have cost him in Nov.

After months of telling the world that Covid was fake and then it would just go away made accepting a cure for something that didn't exist seem untenable to the MAGA crowd. Instead, Trump went with the ""stolen"" election scam as early as last Aug.  

So why should he do the right thing now and speak up for a shot?  Has the man ever been right ?"
2021-03-16 14:03:46,"I think this is nonsense and a concerted effort to demonize Republicans for strictly political advantage.  I find widespread acceptance of the vaccine everywhere I look, both in the liberal urban areas (Democrat) and the rural conservative (Republican) areas between which I divide my time.  FWIW, the only people I have encountered who expressed opposition to the vaccine are young (20s) and liberal.  I wouldn’t make any sweeping generalizations out of that and neither should you."

Since the business requires employees and subcontractors to enter other people’s homes, we are requiring proof of vaccination from his employee’s and anyone with whom my husband contracts, and any of their workers who enter a client’s home. 

We cannot guarantee that anyone who comes in contact with a contractor is vaccinated, but we are guaranteeing our clients that anyone who enters their homes will be vaccinated. We are demanding proof of vaccination.

And yes, we can do this legally. We are a private organization and are hiring private contractors or employees. So if you bozos continue to fly your flag of freedom, you can do so unemployed, because more employers are on our side of the fence than on yours."

I have come to the conclusion, if Republicans and Trump followers don't want the vaccine let them not get it and face getting Covid.  Most of the others will be vaccinated by then, and will be at a lower risk.  Those who don't listen, they will be pariahs amongst us, and even among some Republicans."

2021-03-16 14:14:33,"NO. Biden does not need to have his predecessor involved.  He must not go begging or offering incentives as bargaining chips to get Trump’s support.  Those moves will only embolden Trump and give him more credibility with his conspiracy ridden base.  The new Republican base has others of influence to listen to.  There are religious leaders and other politicians locally who can be influencers.  There are celebrities who are on the Right with influence.  It will take another viral surge, unfortunately to convince these people what the rest of us know.  Science is real and outcomes are predictable.  There are also negative behavioral tactics which can be used such as so-called green cards to allow vaccinated people more access to events and travel.  We don’t need to invoke the fake blessings of a demagogue."
2021-03-16 14:07:00,"Trump never had compassion for those families who suffered from Covid.  Yes, there were a few words (most likely written by aides) which he delivered but the pattern has been that even after suffering from Covid he gave little thought of others in that predicament.   Thing of the good that he could do if he made a public announcement via television that he urges people to be vaccinated as he had his wife had.  But since he doesn't want to anger any who have supported him he hasn't come forward."
2021-03-16 14:04:28,"The facts are clearly presented in paragraph four:  ex-President Trump was vaccinated despite having been hospitalized for COVID-19, and he urged his supporters to get vaccinated.  Why blast Republicans as a whole because a poll, which may be of dubious authenticity, concluded that 30% will refuse to do so.  Just because the lunatic fringe of the party refuses it does not prove that all those of us who voted conservative in 2020 are included.  Furthermore it seems decidedly political for President Biden to make the inane comment that enlisting Trump's support for a presidential level promotion of vaccination isn't important, all the more when he believes that Trump had enough sway over his followers to have caused the incursion into the Capitol.  

We have a relatively high mortality rate compared to other countries known for reliable reporting of health-related matters, but there is nothing that correlates this to the political party of any state governor.  The pandemic touched everyone in the country, and trying to play politics in a nation-wide effort to bring contagion under control is pointless and counterproductive."

Give it to those who want it, and as the resistors see all their neighbors vaccinated, their number will gradually shrink. And when vaccination is finally available to all, make it a requirement for participating in society. Within a year it will be available for children, and, as for other communicable diseases, they won’t be allowed to sit in a classroom if unvaccinated. Similarly, I don’t see why legislation is needed for private businesses, airlines, etc., to require vaccination for their employees and customers. I see signs saying: “NO MASK, NO SERVICE.”  Why not “No Vaccination?”"
2021-03-16 13:45:33,"There should be penalties for refusing the vaccine when you can get it.

About 17 million people in the EU and the UK have received a dose of the vaccine, with fewer than 40 cases of blood clots reported as of last week. This is no more than would be expected in the normal course of events. In fact a number of world leading health agencies are standing behind the AZ jabs, including WHO, the highly respected MHRA of the UK, as well as our own CDC (expected soon). 

Examining more closely also suggests a political motive in some EU members’ pause on AZ. Recall that Pfizer, the first to gain EU approval is manufactured for that region, is manufactured in Belgium, while the AZ is manufactured in the UK. The EU had blocked exports of Pfizer to the UK fearing inadequate allocation for its own members.  This the biggest modern test of the EU’s ability to act collectively and it’s failing.  European governments are blaming vaccine hoarding, manufacturing delays and side effects. But opinion polls suggest that most Europeans believe the EU is doing poorly in getting jabs in arms. The virus is mutating aggressively so it’s a race to get populations vaccinated fast to achieve herd immunity. 

The EU is shooting itself in the foot by sowing doubt - that’s the problem in a loose confederation of 27 different nations, a pandemic exposes its weaknesses."

Why can't we have a system where a restaurant owner (I pick restaurants because that segment of business has been hurt the most) can certify that all of their employees have been vaccinated, and all that have a valid medical reason not to can get a pass. But not like a medical reason to use medical marijuana, a valid reason!

It’s time to unleash ad agencies to create a persuasive campaign to change petulant hearts and minds. That’s how you counter-program. Secondly, disseminators of false information that harm people, and by extension, America at large, should be fined and sued. If you can’t yell, ""Fire!"" in a crowded theater, then how does anti-vaccine propaganda go unchallenged? If a media outlet is knowingly spreading false information that harms the public, make them prove their claims in court. Put conspiracy theory on trial."

One “ad” in particular sticks out in my memory- a young man says he doesn’t want to wear a seat belt because it constrains his movements, and in the next shot (after a car accident) he’s shown in the hospital in practically a full body cast. Very effective messaging.

Perhaps we need similar ads now- a man or woman is shown saying that they don’t want the vaccine because, for example,  they’ve heard about possible side effects, and in the next shot they are shown in hospital with Covid, hooked up to a ventilator with doctors or nurses hovering over them trying to save their lives. Refusing the vaccine for any number of spurious reasons is like playing Russian roulette with your life and the lives of others."

Instead, publicize  facts . DJT and Melania, Rupert Murdoch and other prominent GOP got the vaccine at the earliest opportunity.  Also, another fact not often mentioned in the antivac debate is that the mRNA research had been going on for a couple years before COVID hit, so the vaccines were not conjured up in a couple months."

Anyone with the responsibility to persuade vaccination skeptics that themselves continue to describe COVID-19 vaccines as “rushed”, “experimental,” “opportunistic” and “government manipulation"" will simply fail in the crucial global task of vaccinating the largest fraction of people as possible.  If it is indeed true conservatives leaders learned for the first time on Mr. Lutz's call, five facts about the virus, including, “The more we vaccinate, the faster we can get to growing the economy and getting jobs.” then find another group because this collection of conservatives have not paid, and likely will never pay, close enough attention to be helpful in the challenge of expanding vaccinations."

We may be on a downward trend now, but this is a critical time. The more pressure we put on killing the virus without actually killing it, the more likely it will evolve to evade our solutions.

There should be one plan . Distribute the vaccine to every state in a week . Governors distribute the vaccine to injection sites .

They also think that Biden's cancellation of the Keystone XL pipeline is the reason that gasoline prices have gone up.  They are completely clueless about just about every issue.

The first would involve the ex president staring into the camera, and in a very dry, bland monotone, reading some script provided to him by the CDC on a teleprompter with little enthusiasm. 

The other scenario, much more likely, would involve him improvising, and quickly burying the message about the need to be vaccinated, while he then turns the subject to himself, and talks about the vaccine being the ""greatest achievement the world has ever known"", and for which he deserves all the credit!

The party's obstinance and rejection of ideas that don't emerge from the narrow world views of their preferred religions or cultures, their yearning for social, scientific, and, obsessively, sexual ideals of the past is increasingly shrill and, quite frankly, sad (has been for a long while, but it's grown exponentially over the last decade and, exponentially upon that, during the Trump years)."

At least it was a start and more press releases by him encouraged by his strategists it are  in the wings  prompted by the reporting revealing that he got his shot in January.

Enough of the identity politics. People are right to question the efficacy and safety of the vaccine. In the interest of public health, it is important to answer their questions.

The fewer people vaccinated the more opportunity the virus has to mutate. As we've already seen, it's mutating into more contagious and deadlier strains. Pockets of vaccine deniers are a perfect breeding ground for the virus, which in turn affects us all.

It sure sounds like people of color in NYC have overcome  fears that sounded to this white person like insanity - ""Will the vaccine *WE* get be designed to kill us, track us, sterilize us?""

Somehow - probably by intelligent staffing and placement of vaccination sites and the like - NYC has, I think, moved the needle on that thinking.

But I'm reminded of a post I saw months back where a nurse in ND referenced what was once more than a slogan -

""North Dakota nice.""

She said that - before vaccinations were available and Covid was sky high out there - people would go ballistic when she insisted that they wear masks properly as hospital visitors or patients.

Obviously, that was ""politics"" talking. True, Trump seems to have been muzzled (mad dog style, really) for now, but it may take months or years for people to go back to anything like rational thinking.

But the information IS getting out there - comparing States, countries, etc. - as to what works. We're nearing a point where 2 maps colored red-yellow&green, one for % vaccinated, one for cases per thousand residents should be compelling for the not insane.

2021-03-16 16:12:18,"Is it unkind of me to suggest that if certain people can't see the wisdom of taking a safe and extremely effective vaccine in order to protect themselves against a deadly pandemic, then perhaps we should just allow them to make that choice and accept the consequences? You know, ""more vaccines for the rest of us""?

It would be wonderful to think that we could vaccinate enough people to eradicate this virus. But that's not a realistic possibility. Covid-19 has reached even the most remote corners of the world, and it will continue to flare up periodically for the rest of our lives. The fact that some percentage of people in the US refuse to take the vaccine when it is available to them does not change that.

For those of us willing to be vaccinated, Covid will soon cease to be a deadly threat, and will in coming years be nothing more than a minor inconvenience as we require additional shots to guard against new variants. For those who refuse, the results will sometimes be tragic.

There are many Republicans who claimed that wearing masks and social distancing were personal choices, and that mandating these measures took away their personal freedom. Well, in freedom begins responsibility. If you choose not to vaccinate, you have to accept responsibility if you or a loved one gets seriously ill or dies. Fair enough?"

Because of the way we all fell in the vaccine roll-out, most all the adults in my immediate family have been vaccinated including myself, and it’s a marvelous thing.  We can all get together again, and we are planning a family getaway to Cape Cod this summer.  Significantly more than a half a million of our fellow citizens have been killed by this virus in the past year and many thousands more are suffering long term medical problems as a result of being infected.  Why someone would not want to protect themselves and their loved ones from that fate by getting a shot is something I am completely unable to comprehend."

Why are ""Conservative Republicans"" so  willfully ignorant of science and so afraid of scientific truths yet believe the fantasies told them by the Bible and the lies told them by Trump and his many lying followers?

As more rational folks get vaccinated, the chances of an irrational Trump supporter contracting the disease decreases, so they will feel right in making their decision not to vaccinate.  Of course, a relative few will contract the virus, most of those will recover intact, further supporting their decision.  It's rather funny, from a certain point of view.  But if the variants take over, and they're more transmissible, things could change."

The insurance companies should have an out on paying for the hospital bills associated with covid in these cases. Again, not thrilled with the bailout of the financial services and insurance companies in 2008, but this nonsense of conspiracy theories giving people unprecedented rights to spread disease, run around with guns and live their deplorable lives under the constant fear of the corruption of their precious bodily fluids has to stop.

He was backed by a powerful media machine. He was backed by celebrities and wealthy conservatives. He was backed by powerful religions and other ideological cults. He was backed by world leaders. And he lost by a landslide. Trump himself made certain that he wouldn't be re-elected. It had nothing to do with a pandemic. People just aren't great at math. If the Republicans stick with the same game they are playing they should lose the next election be an even greater margin.

We just put the dots together and rode the virus out at home like many in our community. The CDC has no idea how many people actually had covid.

Have them sign an affidavit stating that do not believe that the virus is real, and if they get sick they only will go to the store to buy something over the counter, and sweat it at home!

Goodness gracious!"

For example, the latest Gallup poll shows that 25% of Americans identify as Republicans (I assume this is adults.) So if 1/3 of Republicans say that won't take the vaccine, that's about 8-9% of the adult population at-large.

That's not great, and yes, that number has to be added to the other populations that are vaccine-hesitant. But it's not as catastrophic as a context-free statement: ""1/3 of Republicans"" won't take the vaccine.

With a highly personalized campaign, relying on personal doctors, clergy, and friends/family, I'm confident that proportion will come down. Eliminated? No. But surely reduced."

If the vaccines prove to be effective along with continued facemask use and following guidelines we will see continued decline in infection amongst those people. The vaccine and facemask resisters, who have not already been infected, will sadly learn the hard way--that Covid 19 is real and not to be messed with."

The health and BIG pharma complex says there is no need for concern.  However, they - like the military in wars - expect a certain percentage of ""casualties"".  I will not be one of them.

Anyone who is healthy and wants to be vaccinated should be.  Meantime, any call to refuse service to the unvaccinated, in my opinion, is just to make bigger profits.  VERY sad but true.

OUR elected (hired) lawmakers MUST rein in, break up, tax and regulate BIG pharma NOW so people can regain trust in OUR medical system.  Start with ending the tax break for BIG pharma direct-to-consumer advertising on television and other media.  Let us decide if our DOCTORS should prescribe OUR medicines without industry pressure."

Similar ""rejectionists"" were legion in 1918 when the influenza pandemic started (although vaccines weren't available then, anti-maskers were a problem).  We should have learned the lessons of leadership timidity then, but alas not.

The nations that have handled the pandemic well are cohesive societies, bound by a sense of shared responsibility and social order.  Even Australia has done well, powered by a sense of unity that shared difficulties for a short period will lead to freedom from disease after.  Such unity is sorely lacking in the US.  Our leaders - governmental, scientific, entertainment and spiritual - must come out forcefully to call for a spirit of shared sacrifice and duty now.  If not, we are in for another dark winter."

And perhaps one of the first places the Biden Administration may want to seek public/ private cooperation, is seeking a mandatory Coviod-19 vaccination stipulation for every medical facility in the US that accepts publicly funded Medicare or Medicaid  (as is similar to the current flu vaccination stipulations many individual States already insists on for all healthcare personnel who practice in their respective States).

Finally, with a focus on vaccination education, why couldn't the Biden Administration also begin to sponsor citizen panels of survivors of Covid-19 victims to give their testimony at public meetings held throughout the US, as to the impact of losing a loved one to the Covid virus on their families and the communities?"

Leaving two percent of such people to perish of political stupidity seems like a net plus for democracy and the future of America, and a beneficial medication for the cancer of Republican white supremicist racism.  

If only there were a fiscally conservative, socially and culturally progressive American political party like Republicans were before Richard Nixon (when I was young the slave states of the South were solidly Democratic).  In my nostalgic view, it's Donald Trump, Mitch McConnell, Ted Cruz and Lindsay Graham who are the real RINOs.

Once that trust is gone, I listen but do not believe -- and, more often than naught, I do not even listen.

There are consequences to decisions.  The Democratic Party -- and far too many liberals -- have lost the trust of the right. 

To now expect that trust will bloom is foolish. 

Better is to seriously consider why and how that trust was broken, instead of denying it as the behavior of uneducated, old people.  As a former faculty member, I am neither.

Unless and until I can safely assume that that hypothetical man has been vaccinated, I'll assume, of course, that he hasn't been vaccinated and, therefore, poses a danger to me and to you -- just as I routinely assumed in the pre-vaccine days.

But the other 2 vaccination opponents are about as left-wing as they come, even though they give the very same reasons as the right-winger gives for the decision to forgo vaccination (the vaccines haven't been tested enough; we shouldn't let the government tell usbwhat to do, etc. -- all of the standard ""reasons"" you've undoubtedly heard).

In short,  2 out of the 3 anti-vaxxers I know are left-wing, not right-wing. In addition, most ""front line"" nurses oppose vaccination, as this article makes clear. Are those front-line nurses mostly right-wingers? I doubt it -- I suspect that most of them are left-leaning.

Frankly, it never occurred to me that so many people would refuse to be vaccinated. But that is what's happening. Should we conclude that all of those people are Republicans (even though I know they're not). Should we assume we can isolate them, so that they infect only one another but not you or me?

The current administration and its revitalized CDC will keep up with virus surveillance and modify the vaccine(s) accordingly. As long as the vaccinated keep up with the reformulated vaccines, we should be fine.

If Confederate state whites don’t want vaccines and are willing to take their chances, so be it.

Health care providers know that tender, reactive lymph nodes are extremely common, usually self-resolve, and are very rarely a sign of a serious problem. Most people receiving a Covid vaccine, however, do not. And, unfortunately, it seems that few people are being informed about this not uncommon side effect at the time of their vaccination. 
This article acknowledges, but also minimizes, the emotional trauma such a finding can engender and the unnecessary, uncomfortable, expensive and sometimes invasive testing that often gets done to reassure the patient and the clinician. 
I'd like to think I'm wrong but I wonder if researchers' findings had been a bit different* (see below) this information would have appeared on the front page (not buried in the ""Science & Technology"" section).  
*The ""different"" version: A clinician discussing a lump their male patient discovered:
""I can assure you that the lump you found is very unlikely to be testicular or penile cancer.""
""Since this is, in all likelihood, nothing serious and will probably go away on its own, I think it's reasonable to ""watch and wait"" and follow-up in 2 - 3 months if it hasn't resolved.""

I then found creditble data that 16% of those who has the shot had lymph edema in their arm and neck indicating false positives for breast cancer.  Also there were a very small number of participants with cancer or beating treated for cancer. 

I was a few days out from my MRI and since the 16% who got lympho edema had to wait between 4-9 days for swelling to go down, and worse several of them were taking to mammography and ultrasound and received false positives for Breast Cancer.  

I can't imagine if I'd kept my vaccine appointment and then was one of the 16% (with my luck) so I cancelled it.

But why aren't they telling MD's about this side effect, like they did the PEG and anaphylactic shot?  My surgeon has not been informed (that  I know of; or I'm positive he'd have his patients do it after surgery.  One of the primary things they look at is if the seminal lymph node under the arm to look for spread.  (If all of you nodes are swelling under your arm and in your neck and they don't know that this is a side effect of the vaccine; it could easily be construed as something more serious!

2021-03-02 22:53:38,"The Moderna vaccine may be highly effective; but it isn’t a walk in the park. Dose 1 left me with painful swelling up and down the arm that received the injection - I could barely lift my arm to wash my hair or maneuver it to put on or take off a shirt for two days; and I was physically exhausted for days after the swelling resolved.

Dose 2 is the real doozy. Within hours, in addition to the expected swelling up and down my injected arm, I broke out in a cold sweat, with body aches, swollen lymph nodes and fever pushing 102 F that pretty well remained there despite use of Tylenol. This lasted for about two days; a couple of days of dead tired followed after the fever finally broke. 

We’re told this is just proof the vaccine has stimulated a robust immune response and that we’re getting the full measure of protection against serious illness, hospitalization and death from the covid-19 virus. After having weathered two rounds of pretty unpleasant ‘side effects,’ I certainly hope that’s true; and I plan to start changing my lifestyle assuming that it is."

I'm thankful to have majored in microbiology in college because all this info from my immunology course came rushing in from some deep, dark crevice in my brain-- it makes sense that my lymph node is in hyperdrive right now because the lymph node is where the passive immune system (read: immune cells find a weird thing and they try to destroy it) passes the football off to the active immune system (read: specialized immune cells that take a more ~nuanced~ approach). It's dendritic cells presenting the spike protein to T cell to find the right match, kind of like speed dating. While it feels like I'm being jabbed really hard in the armpit, it's a nice reminder to me that my immune system is working hard to learn what this virus looks like so it can fortify itself against it.

2021-03-08 15:12:10,"So the P1 variant can spread after herd immunity is reached with the first form of the virus.    

I see that 'variant' can encompass more than one mutation in the virus.   The P1 variant has 17 unique mutations, including three in the receptor binding domain of the spike protein.  

Variants are a classification of a given set or location of mutations.    Now variants have mutations that cross classifications.   I wouldn't call that a recombination yet.    In some ways we've been incredibly lucky.     We may see a third wave of pandemic that's worse than what we have seen so far, but I doubt it will be any worse than twice as bad.

Keep distance of this bigot and sociopath called, Jair Bolsonaro, the president of Brazil. 
Thanks to Jair Bolsonaro's bigotry and hate of science, here in Brazil, there's no vaccines and coronavirus is killing more than 1,500 Brazilian lifes, on each day. 
Don't think that Jair Bolsonaro is a follower of God. The only gods that Jair Bolsonaro really follows are: Power and Money. Jair Bolsonaro is also a follower of the astrologer and warlock Olavo de Carvalho. In fact, the absurds believes of Jair Bolsonaro in the mumbo-jumbo of chloroquine as a ""miraculous"" drug against coornavirus comes from the astrologer Olavo de Carvalho.

P.2? P.3? P.4? P.5?  What’s wrong?  “The Law of Large Numbers” is what’s wrong. It’s in play here.

“The Law of Large Numbers” is a statistical observation. It means that it has too many opportunities to infect your cells. Too many millions of ordinary people are there for possible infection; think of them as targets.  Each one intent on going about his or her business.  Each one with their own private hopes, fears and cares.  Each and every one has maybe 31 trillion nucleotides in his or her body. As well as all the scofflaws and careless people out there who simply don’t, or won’t, observe any precautions. Any.  Too many anti-vaxxers and holdouts. Too many “libertarians”, although personal liberty isn’t an issue here except in their own minds.

All of these scientific facts and recalcitrant attitudes translate into affording the virus too many chances to copy itself erroneously.  Which means its random outliers — things we call “P.2”, “P.3”,  “P.4” — will become its salvation.  

It means that you really can’t contain it no matter what you do.  It will slowly roll around your established defenses no matter how big and stout they are. Perfection simply can’t be obtained no matter what you do.  It will come in its own time, and in its own way. Your only hope is that it becomes less lethal as it spreads far and wide, uncontained and uncontainable."

All quickly hit the carrying capacity of the environment and fall back down to their natural equilibrium.  Flu does that, as does the cold coronavirus.  This latest coronavirus is doing the same.  

A vaccine effectively lowers the carrying capacity of the environment by making viral transmission more difficult.  That's what the flu vaccine does.  Although it's only about 50% effective it makes it difficult for the flu virus to infect.

Viruses continually work to avoid vaccine roadblocks by trial and error.  They keep trying whereas the vaccine does not adapt, so the Virus has the upper hand.  It will always win.  

What does not kill the Virus makes it stronger.  Vaccines make the Virus stronger.  Every year we get a new Flu vaccine for the latest iteration.  

Since vaccines do not adapt like the virus does, we have to continually pay pharma for a new temporary solution.   

But our immune systems do adapt and are more than a match for most viruses.  There are trillions of virus inside us right now kept in check by the immune system.

The permanent solution is to beef up your immune system and let the Virus attain environmental equilibrium.  

This Virus is no more deadly than the Flu or the Cold.  But if you are 80 with comorbidities and compromised immunity all three are equally deadly.  

The problem is compromised immunity - not the Virus."

We have not yet understood as a nation that paying attention to this saying goes before understanding the pathophysiology of the virus comes mainly from its activation of NF-kB, a transcription factor that when activated migrates to the nucleus, binds to gene promotor regions and causes ""crosstaking"" oxidative stress and cytokine storms.

Once we understand this lession for which David Baltimore won the Nobel Prize and once we read his 2006 paper on NF-kB that David Baltimore showed that proinflammatory proteins as Tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha can activate NF-kB and that ""antioxidants"" can inhibit this activation, we will come to understand the valuable role anti-oxidants can play along with vaccines in a dual one two punch on even the Brazilian variansts.

We can and we will do comparative effectiveness studies on the value of comparative effectiveness studies that pit vaccines alone versus vaccine _ antioxidants as those that deactivate NF-kB and activate Nrf2, the ""good actor"" in this drama to kill the virus before its kills us.

2021-03-09 03:12:28,"This is an erroneous take on the latest literature.

Dr. Faria et al. didn’t measure a single reinfection, but rather used a model that assumed their prior estimates from a serosurvey were correct. 

This is a house of cards: the serosurvey in Manaus, for example, was collected by convenience sampling advertising blood tests for COVID antibodies, plausibly disproportionately sampling people who were recently ill (for comparison with the 52% seroprevalence in the serosurvey, a blood bank in Manaus, far more representative, had a 12% seroprevalence). To scale up from 52% to 76% the authors assumed some waning seropositivity. Because the authors assumed such a high cumulative incidence, the *only* way *their model* of P1 would allow rising cases is if it had some ability to evade immunity. However, we have yet to see immunoevasive strains that properly evade the T-cell response (indisputably the more important and less measured arm of the immune system - in UK nurses, for every seropositive patient there was one seronegative pt with T-cells recognizing SARS-CoV-2).

House of cards - the authors have not documented reinfections and this the excessively alarming title and obsequious coverage in this article isn’t warranted at this point."

Where is the study that can tell us how an enterprise funded largely by Medicare and Medicaid payments can turn a profit while providing excellent medical care?  How on earth could a profit result from practices other than limiting costs — such as facilities maintenance, operations, administrators’ salaries, and above all, labor?"

I chose the only one with a 5-star rating, believing it would be more than satisfactory. After a week, my wife suffered an injury to her arm and was left unattended for most of the day. She literally begged me to shorten her prescribed two-week stay, and when they could not produce the necessary documents for an official ""release,"" I removed her under protest.

Someday I hope you will do the same deep dive for how tough it is for families and individuals to access the non-institutional support needed to take care of someone at home - the main reason people end up relying on these vile places. We can and need to do better to protect the vulnerable members of our society."

In one facility, they only sporadically fed the patients. In another, they force-fed the patients. In yet another, they lacked the nursing capacity to properly administer needed painkillers. All three of them, for-profit institutions, were chronically understaffed (or poorly staffed with the wrong workers). The food was bad in all of them. The so-called enrichment programs were an insult to the residents (what is the point in a nostalgic music appreciation gathering where the music played was a half century older than anything these residents had ever cared to listen to in their own lives? Utterly demoralizing. And over the course of nine years for one relative, and two and a half years for another, the financial cost exceeded a million dollars.

2021-03-13 17:27:39,"As a physician who has served nursing home residents, I wish to share my 2 cents in this important conversation.

First, let pursuit of excellence not be enemy of perfection.

Secondly, not many physicians in my community wish to see patients in nursing homes simply because of amount of litigation involved related to residents for alleged abuse and neglect wherein even when the allegations are against a corporate running nursing home chain, a physician is dragged for depositions and name brought up in newspapers with impression created as if physician is  codefendant in the suit.

Thirdly, turnover rate in nurses and nurses aids is very high because of low morale in current environment.

Yes, we need better care for our seniors.
But we need to be thankful that there are nurses and physicians who are willing to care for the elderly who are sick and dependent even for basic needs as going to bathroom. It is easy to sit at home and make allegations and difficult to do the job that an elderly expected a younger family member to do, just as a parent took care of his child when child was dependent on parent."
2021-03-13 17:28:14,"I am on the board for a non profit Skilled Nursing Facility. Over the years we have found it incredulous at the star ratings for the nearby for profit homes. When we would visit, they were relative ghost towns compared to ours. Yet somehow they always managed to have 4 and 5 star staffing ratings. 

When the pandemic hit, we had a spike in deaths from COVID. But compared to the other homes in the area, we lost a lot fewer residents than our counterparts. In the early days - April 2020 in particular - many residents who died were not reported as COVID due to there not being testing available. To understand the true impact of COVID you need to look at the spike in deaths compared to the natural rate. 

Families make the decision to have their loved one enter a home with a heavy heart and often with a need many of us do not understand. This can be done in a caring, humane manner. Not for Profits typically strive for this in their mission."

They will lie in your records and there are no protection in place for people. Simple things they can do aren't done, like requiring that patient have real time access to all the data in the records, rather than only the limited information hospitals want us to see on their terms. And giving the patient the ability to record progress notes in the record or add data to the visit and documents. As it is now, the patient is the only one not allowed to write in our records yet is the main stakeholder in the transaction. And who creates the rules of the electronic records? The government!

That survey you get after your hospital stay with useless questions that have nothing to do with the quality of your care? The government created those too!

This amounts to human rights abuses, and we need real solutions to these problems. Hospitals and institutions who engage in corruption should get no government handouts as they are now.

At approximately $10,000 dollars a month, I witnessed my husband who has advanced Parkinson's sustain a broken rib, deep gashes to his lower leg, unsanitary conditions, and sub-par and at times not fully cooked food, including chicken and pork.  Make no mistake, owners are in this ""business"" for the money; that is the bottom line.  They will hire unqualified caregivers who are underpaid.  They will get by with the minimum of staff.  That brings me to the next unforgivable problem.  Our state legislatures set the bar so low that ""snakes"" can slither over rather than under it.  The buck stops with our capitals.

And even supplement the income of the working adult who cannot afford to quit their job.
For all of our technological innovations, high degree of education, we are primitive and even barbarian when it comes to caring for people or animals who are dependent upon us for most of their elementary needs.  
We allow ridiculous profits and incomes to be made in the business world.  Oh, we have the ""best system there can be, capitalism, even with its flaws"" but we never admit that people and animals become commodities.  Animals are ""livestock"" and ""cattle"".  People are considered a burden unless taken off the shelf for the pleasure of the young, health adults, quite often. Do I sound harsh? No, I am not. 50 years ago I worked as a medical social worker in an affluent Boston area hospital.  Part of my job was discharge planning.  From the hospital staff it was ""get them out!

In the intervening years, my siblings and I took a ""soft"" approach to having them make a cl move to assisted living. Some of my siblings (I'm the oldest of seven) wanted to be more demanding that they move. Some, like me, had too much respect for them as independent adults to force a decision on them. However, we all agreed a change sooner or later was better than the status quo.

Once Covid-19 hit, and assisted care centers became de facto prisons, I was very happy that my parents resisted.

All hospitals and nursing homes try to game their statistics, and this is driven by the leadership and owners. It’s a poorly kept secret across the system. It is very hard to truly grade and evaluate the quality of health care, so whatever silly scoring system is created will be circumvented and fudged. The real problem with these facilities is that caring for these patients is expensive, challenging and laborious, and no one, not insurance carriers, the government, patients, nor their families want to pay for it. High quality cares costs a lot of money, plain and simple. Also, many people expect the same level of care as a hospital, and it just doesn’t happen. There are no easy solutions, and nobody has an extra 100 billion to throw at this problem. Of course the trend at the NYT is to blame the evil businesspeople and venture capitalists, but I know for a fact that most government-run (veterans or otherwise) facilities are just as bad if not worse. Difficult problem, few easy solutions."

Even in the best of cases, they are pitiful places. Residents needs are not attended to in timely fashion. Some require extra care, because of dementia, but instead are left screaming in the hallways while the other residents are trying to get some rest. The staff is overworked, and underpaid. 
In the short term units, inpatients and their families, in a coordinated fashion from the social worker, rehab director, and admin, are sold the idea that they are not better yet, that they need to stay longer in order to go home safely. Yet there is usually little evidence to support this, and many patients who stay longer and up getting ill, oftentimes from catching something in the facility itself. 
Piece of advice, unless your loved one is in truly dire straights, unable to do anything despite having loved ones at home and access to covered home care services, avoid a nursing facility or SNF at all cost, even if they are 5 star rated. 
If you must go, ignore the aesthetics and ask the following questions:
How many CNAs per unit during the day and during the night? 
How often does your doctor round in the facility? 
Are patients placed in a private room? 
Does the facility use an electronic medical record system? 
and is there an independent wound care team (not just the facility nurses) that round during the week to manage wounds. 
There’s more, but I’m space Ltd."
2021-03-13 18:01:48,"The states are complicit in both the substandard level of care and the papering over of incidents of primarily neglect and error, as opposed to abuse. Most occurrences of neglectful care eminate from a single cause: understaffing. Being the root of most evils, a short staffed nursing home can’t meet the needs of residents relying enhanced care (despite common perception that nursing homes are populated by the elderly, many residents suffer from severe disabilities and are unable to be cared for at home); the remaining staff are thus over worked, resulting in unintentional but real neglect; some of the overworked and underpaid staff develop resentment particularly at residents who may require greater attention or who suffer from cognitive deficiencies. This is my observation as serving a year as a long term care ombudsman.
The responsible government agencies, particularly the states, are complicit in permitting this situation to continue. Legislation requiring specific staff to resident ratios routinely sit on the desks of legislators. But increasing the number of critical staff members, certified aides and nurses, would require the for-profit nursing industry to increase wages and payroll; increased Medicaid reimbursement rates would be demanded to meet the financial requirements. And so the inspectors, health department officials, legislators and governors overlook the “routine” deficiencies that in fact cause most of the harm, and focus on the most egregious violations."
2021-03-13 18:04:02,Many facilities require families to sign contracts.  Many contracts contain non-disclosure agreements.  Many non-disclosure agreements include provision which preclude families from speaking out about conditions at the facilities.   Further exploration of these provisions  would make for a welcome follow-up to this piece.
2021-03-13 18:05:04,"The state of our senior care deeply saddens me.  Staffing ratios, for hands on care, desperately needs to be increased.  You can not  expect one nursing assistant to give quality care to 15 patients. You can not expect therapists to meet productivity levels that are truly unmanageable. Human beings have unexpected needs and wants. These do not fit into a profitable equation for the bean counters. Please let us give the care we strive for. The fancy foyer, with a chandelier, is unable to provide care to our frail seniors."
2021-03-13 18:05:11,"I’ve lived in the independent living quarters of a nursing facility in California since September 2020. I was one of 3 persons housed here in a separate building who contracted COVID from a worker. One of us, a wonderful woman age 87, was admitted to the ER with symptoms much more severe then my neighbor and I and was hospitalized more than three months, having to be transferred four times during that period. She survived, thank goodness as have the other resident and myself. Others over in the assisted living building were not as fortunate, with at least 8 deaths. 
I must say that care here is reasonable, the staff are friendly and helpful but, (I’m astounded this isn’t mentioned in the article) the food provided is; and I’m being kind here- atrocious at best- inedible at it’s worst- sugary, starchy & highly processed. I love my dog, which I’m allowed to keep, but wouldn’t feed her a bite of the stuff. 
I would beg to differ that this business operates on thin margins though, admittedly I don’t have access to the books, the place is quite expensive. Without the long term care insurance I’ve carried for 24 years I could not afford to live here. I suppose I’m one of the lucky ones."
2021-03-13 18:06:08,"After a seizure that left me unable to walk, I was a resident in a nursing home for three months. There were a few nurses’ assistants who actually paid attention and were helpful but on the weekends the facility was a ghost town. I fought every day to have my two physical therapy sessions because it was the only part of being a resident that actually worked and I got out in three months - and walked out. One of my roommates was mentally unstable (pre-COVID so I shared a room) and almost every night he got out of bed when he was told to call for a nurse if he needed the bathroom. A few nights, usually around 3am, he fell and then the room was full of staff who then had to fill out accident reports. The man should have been in a private room close to the nurses’ station. The reason I fought to get out was I discovered that after 90 days it would cost me $500 a day to stay in the facility. The system is broken and I can confirm that from friends who have known people in the same facility I was in. The government must step in and protect the most vulnerable in our society ASAP. This article will hopefully create a demand across the country that the elderly be treated with respect and care until the day they die and not allowed to die so some company can profit off their death. Let’s stop blaming the staff and start holding the management and owners up to an oath of “do no harm.” Laws are being broken and lives are being lost. Let’s start criminalizing those responsible."
2021-03-13 18:08:12,"A similar story could be written by The Times about how CMS awards stars to Medicare Part D providers for prescription drugs.  
A few years ago, during open enrollment, I switched insurance companies based in large part on CMS awarding five stars to this new plan.
I take over 10 medications, many without a generic equivalent.  While the plan still receives the highest rating, they deny coverage for 8 of 10 of my medications.  This results in wasted precious time for my physicians, who then must submit overrides.
Invariably, my plan receives its annual five star rating, which leads me to wonder whether this rating system is equally as flawed as CMS’ nursing facility ratings method."
2021-03-13 18:08:41,"Most states have laws against elder abuse and mandatory reporting of it. However, the worst instigators of this abuse, nursing homes, are rewarded with stars, which translate into profits. How can we keep corrupt investigators in check? The problem occurs in most industries where investigators are common. Restaurants in California somehow have gotten it right, if I’m not mistaken. What do they do to ensure accurate reporting of results?"
2021-03-13 18:09:12,"About 15 years ago I had to find a nursing home in Manhattan for the ""sub acute rehab"" my mother needed following a serious hospital stay. The ""social workers"" at her ""#1 in Manhattan"" upper east side teaching hospital were useless.

Somehow or another I found out about a nonprofit here that collects and shares data and comments about such places. They can't recommend or rate them, but they will tell you over the phone what kind of comments they have.

For instance,  on one place they said something like ""we understand the medical director there has a reputation for over medicating."" For another they said ""they also have younger patients there who can be aggressive about demanding more than their share of therapists' time."" On another they said ""the medical staff there are timid and will send the patient back to the hospital at the first sign of trouble.""(something we were desperately trying to avoid). I found their input invaluable.

On staffing,  don't believe any of that. What they report tends to be how many are ""scheduled,"" not how many are actually showing up. Also, many satisfy requirements by hiring agency temps, so they are not permanent employees. Many of these are from other countries, are not mother tongue English speakers and don't communicate well with patients who speak only English.

I highly recommend doing your research this way, and visiting, not using someone's star system."
2021-03-13 18:14:07,"For many years many nursing homes have been run by their owners as profit centers, not as facilities to actually help the residents from a medical or therapeutic point of view. These residents are viewed as dollars or statistics, not human beings. When people are viewed like this you have the problems described in this article. Much stronger oversight and much stronger penalties, including criminal, for non-compliance, are required. As many lawsuits as there are the nursing home owners view them as just another cost of doing business. These residents deserve to be treated properly with dignity and respect, nothing less."
2021-03-13 18:19:02,"I'm a retired RN. I worked in acute care hospitals, beginning in 1968 in direct patient care and ending in the chief nursing officer role, all in California. After 2004 I worked in nonprofit organizations in CA to increase awareness of and find solutions for the RN shortage. After moving to Iowa, I worked in Faith-Based Nursing (AKA Parish Nursing) and in remote medical record review, until 2016 retirement. 

I too believe this has a great deal to do with for-profit healthcare at all levels. When shareholders or corporate profits come first, that is how the administration of the facility is evaluated. Is it any wonder that they do all they can to hold costs down and quality ""reports"" up? There are also issues that, with all due respect to the authors, data analysis and patient or family interviews will never really inform readers about healthcare. 

Our society has made death something to be avoided, helped along by direct consumer advertising about pharmaceuticals and ""advances"". Everyone tends to want the best of everything with minimal personal cost or risk. Providers want to minimize risk too, but if I'm an orthopedic surgeon and you have really bad knees, should I turn your knee replacement opportunity down because you weigh 400 lbs and that's going to make nursing care difficult for your 3 days in acute care and 2 weeks in rehab? Do you know how many of the nursing staff are required to move a 400 lb patient? 

It's more complicated than metrics."
2021-03-13 18:21:38,"Anyone who chooses to take care of their parents who are suffering from physical or mental disabilities is punished for it. Caregiving, whether for your own children, spouse or parents, is not considered working. You are not paid for it and your are not paying into Social Security or Medicare if you are working at taking care of parents.

My mother suffered from Lewy Body dementia and nobody could stand to be around her. I meant to take a few months from work but ended up taking care of my parents for four years. That's four years without a salary or payments into Social Security and Medicare. Afterwards, nobody would hire me because I was now old and had been out of the work force since caregiving is not considered work.

Is it any wonder that desperate people put their parents into horrible nursing homes? We are punished by society if we take care of our own parents."
2021-03-13 18:23:45,"My mother was in assisted living dementia care. They were supposed to have a nurse on staff all the time. Unfortunately, this wasn't true. Mom fell in the night trying to get to her bathroom, broke a thigh and dislocated a hip one. No one knew about it. She was in pain and wanted to stay in bed all the time. No one informed me that she was worse.I came to visit and got her into her wheelchair but after a short period she wanted to get back into bed. Not usual. I called the Hospice nurse who was looking in on her who had been trying to get in touch with me as well. She brought in an x-ray machine the next day and found the problems. Mom went into hospice care and was dead in 10 days. 
  
The place was beautiful. The people were nice. The care was minimal. These places should not be for profit. They skimp on care in order to send better returns to the stockholders. They look nice, but care is minimal. The nurse was fired after Mom died. She was a good nurse but she was the only nurse,  working in 3 units and definitely not on duty 24/7."

I get it there is overhead costs, insurance, food, nurses on staff, actual housing.  But if I have $10k a month to spend, I will stay in my house, with a nurses aide that drives, can take me to Dr. Appt park, senior center if my marbles are all there.  Nursing home is a scam."

2021-03-13 18:00:40,"My heart aches for all those for whom nursing homes are the only option. At 94, my mother required 24/7 care, which she first received in her own home. But a time came when she needed skilled care we could not provide. She went to a “5-star” nursing home. 

While there, we formally reported two incidents, one which placed her in the hospital. Both State investigations said nursing home records showed staff followed correct procedures. But the records were incomplete or inaccurate–contrary to our personal observations and notes we kept. 

Personnel shortages, exceedingly long response times, untimely medication were common. We discussed relocation to other “5-star” rated facilities–but my mother knew each through the experience of friends and relatives and they all had similar problems. She thought the devil you knew was better than the devil you didn’t.  

A fall led to my mother's death. The home blamed the accident on my mother’s actions. Aides told us staff actions were the cause. My mother never recovered enough to tell us what happened.

We visited and advocated for my mother every day she was in care. Sometimes we advocated for other residents who had no one else. We are thankful she was not in the nursing home this past year. Although that facility had no  COVID cases among the residents, my mother would have deteriorated without our daily visits and advocacy. 

Stay as healthy as you can and try to avoid nursing homes at all costs because they will cost you dearly!"

2021-03-13 18:25:38,"It is astounding that as a society we think it is ethical, or even possible, to make an honest profit from properly caring for the most vulnerable and oldest in our society. Are we surprised that a society that has allowed private companies to value nothing other than shareholder profits, has allowed the companies owning these facilities to game the ratings systems in pursuit of that profit? The potential for something to go wrong in such a system is so obvious. Are we all so delusional that we think we can honestly, and I stress honestly, accumulate enough savings over a lifetime of work that it won't happen to us or our relatives? When are we going to start voting for a financial structure for healthcare that takes common sense into account?"
2021-03-13 18:26:24,"Both the feds and the state agencies responsible for oversight and monitoring of nursing homes have failed spectacularly at protecting the elderly. It isn’t rocket science; frequent surprise inspections, interviews with the patients and their families if they have them and then close follow up once problems are identified. Those homes with serious issues should have their admissions frozen and their license to operate placed on a temporary hold. Regulators need to do their job, citizens should not tolerate this continued neglect of the elderly."
2021-03-13 18:26:48,"Comments from a current state nursing home inspector:

Nursing home inspections are unannounced and facilities are absolutely not given advance notice. What happens is the comprehensive annual inspections (the ones that weight most heavily on the CMS rating) occur on a schedule. so based on the date of the previous inspection, facilities can sort of predict and time the next one. 

During our inspections facilities bring in ton of additional staff to simulate compliance with staffing levels. This is not evidence that facilities are tipped about the inspections. Because nursing homes are part of chains, once administrators see the inspectors pulling up on the driveway, they simply phone their sister facilities nearby and ask them to send staff. This augmentation of staff is legal and there is nothing inspectors can do about it.

About the infection control deficiencies being categorized as causing no harm.  In order to bump the deficiency for the next category of harm level (having caused harm to a resident), inspectors have to prove that infection control problems - like improper hand hygiene - directly resulted in a specific infection to a specific resident. This is almost impossible with the resources inspector have.

Best is to seek treatment and care at home. But if you have no choice: (1) non-profit is usually better; (2) stand alone is usually better than chains; (3) smaller (fewer total beds - think around 50-60) usually better."
2021-03-13 18:27:28,"A couple of years ago my wife was in a five star rehab facility. They were very good at responding to patient calls, but I found that most of the time it was an LPN who answered the call, turned the call button off, said everyone was busy but would come when they could. Usually it was twenty minutes or more before anyone came. This is yet another way to game the system."
2021-03-13 18:28:22,"The list of inadequacies is daunting, considering the wave of people soon destined for these facilities.  The buildings are designed for people who die in their seventies, not late eighties or nineties when mobility is almost non-existent.  These conditions make it miserable to work in, and that trickles down to those who live there.  Secondly, if it is to be funded by state aid, it should be state run...period.  The idea that a large percentage of money earmarked for elder care has to go to some superfluous executives is insane.  I don’t say outlaw private nursing homes, but when it has to compete with the no frills of state funded and run, they might actually provide the care one expects in a competitive market.  I always knew when my parents place was getting an inspection...it was full of employees!  Then 5 stars and back to a ghost town.  The are factories that keep people pumping to extract billing, I have seen them and it is reprehensible. My parents were a resource to be exploited, and soon you will be too, only with fewer frills.


How pathetic is it that people would rather say “I’d rather be dead than be in one of those places” rather than try and fix a problem that can be fixed?"
2021-03-13 18:29:14,"Nursing and Long term care facilities are long known for their abuses, mistreatment of workers, and corrupt management. COVID-19 has forced everyone to reckon with these issues. The problem is not just the facilities or management. Organizations are by definition greedy and morally bankrupt. However, the issue is one of the systemic social values that just dont exist. Helping each other, being kind, valuing our elders, protecting those most vulnerable are considered as weak, and communist values. Unfortunately, it is each individual for themselves at this time. At no time in history has this this been more evident."
2021-03-13 18:31:26,"Nursing homes and rehab facilities are vastly under-monitored. Insurance plans choose the least expensive places they can get by with when sending patients to nursing homes or rehab facilities.  My mother had a Medicare advantage plan. Her doctor ordered her to rehab after surgery. The advantage plan offered only one rehab facility. She had no choice even though there were several other rehab facilities near her home. The one she went to had electrical outlets that had black smoke marks around the receptacle plates. The AC wasn’t working very well so I brought her a small fan but she was not allowed to use because of “electrical problems.”  The patient in the bed next to her was there for rehab after hip surgery.  When she asked for ice packs to relieve pain, she was told there were none. The food (frozen pizza, burgers, etc) was not suited to the elderly. I ended up taking meals to my mom and her roommate. I tried to have my mom moved to another facility but was told by the Medicare advantage plan representative that if we moved her it would pay for nothing. I discovered that those advantage plans have complete control over Medicare benefits: advantage plan companies can make a profit by directly collecting Medicare payments for rehab care and then putting the patients in places that charge less than what Medicare pays.  

Biden should order investigations into and unannounced inspections of these facilities."

2021-03-13 18:35:21,"I live in a non-profit continuing care retirement community which has the highest rating from the private Commission on Accreditation of Rehabilitation Facilities, CARF. I know that it deserves it. Facilities chose whether or not to be evaluated and to go though their evaluation and onsite inspection process. It is very thorough. Not only are mission statements, financials, and other basics reviewed but  line staff and residents are interviewed. Service provision is observed. 

The inspectors are all from similar facilities around the country. Our own top managers have been selected to be inspectors in similar facilities in other states.

If there are deficits noted the facility gets a quality improvement plan to remedy them.
 
Obviously the government run star rating has been a dismal failure and resulted in unnecessary deaths. It seems to be highly advisable that when looking for a nursing home due diligence from the patient or family is essential, and a facility being for-profit should raise red flags."

No accountability as my mom was declining. I had no home for her myself, as I was living and working in a home. There were so many situations that were handled by a 'system' of under trained care people who were overworked. State inspectors were 'in bed' with nursing home admins. No truth.

This is not to mention the amount of time it took to get someone to help her to the bathroom when she could not walk or coordinate medical issues among the various staff. It was not their fault but the management who took the $8000/month and did not deliver to expectations, and, at that price, there are expectations. I am not the biggest fan of regulation, but can’t we get to some minimum-standard level of care for minimum price and move up to higher-standard care and enforce and provide families with a way to hold these companies more accountable?"

But in 2 different facilities in 2 different parts of the U.S., on 2 different occasions, when my mother fell, she lay on the floor for 8-10 hours pressing the call button on a necklace provided by the facility.

Despite the fact that several of the problematic facilities mentioned in the article are non-profits, this is still true.  B.) no matter who runs the facilities, the only way to assure that care is being administered in a competent and compassionate way is for relatives to friends to visit regularly.

With this big money comes great power & this power is efficiently & expeditiously deployed to protect profits & preclude care progress in two ways: 
1.Top Lobbyists – for Legislation & Enforcement Control:  Big money hires the top lobbyists to work the system quietly and without notice. No excellent care standards are legislated, nor enforced. Legislative baby steps give the appearance of change to placate the naïve nation.
2.Top Lawyers – for Facility Resident and Family Control:  Top law firms work for these owner/operators.  Residents and families have legislated rights but these rights are overridden/shut down with threatening letters from hired top lawyers…including “cease and desist” phrasing which scares the heck out of Americans.  Residents and families can barely afford the expense of the facility.  They cannot take care of their loved one at home and the threat of that loved one being thrown out of a facility silences them.  Top law firms are deployed to protect facility owner/operators, many big corporate owned.  Resident and/or family shut down is swift, powerful, assured."

2021-03-13 18:47:27,We had to put my grandmother in a facility when she reached 94. It was a small home in a suburb outside of Portland. My brother visited almost daily for the two years she was there. I visited twice a week and my mother visited once a week. We learned the names of the staff and made a point to visit with the director of the facility on a regular basis to say hello and ask a few questions. We all made it quite clear that the care advertised had better be the care given. The elderly need advocates. We need non-profit groups to help the elderly that can't help themselves.
2021-03-13 18:48:18,"After working in the health insurance system, nothing surprises me.  They all strive to 'cook the books' to make themselves more appealing to keep up their profits.  For one I'm glad Oregon has the death with dignity act  as for me I do not want to be in a nursing home ever."
2021-03-13 18:49:34,"And the moral of this story is that nursing home owners and operators have better and more effective lobbyists than their patients and staff.

The oldest member of my family to have COVID-19 caught it in her nursing home.  After she was sent to the hospital for health problems related to her multiple maladies they tested her for COVID-19 in the emergency room.

She spent 3 1/2 weeks sedated receiving oxygen on the verge of being put on a ventilator. We were told that she was doomed and to say our farewells via the phone.

She recovered and they sent her right back to her nursing home.

My experience with nursing homes involving other family members is irregular family visits by time and day. 

I had an uncle with dementia who had his hip broken in a nursing home.  He was in pain but couldn't tell us what happened to him. We sued and they settled."
2021-03-13 18:52:52,"What caught my eye was the photo of Carrie Johnson and the hoard of medications at her bedside. Was she supposed to self administer her medications?  
As an RN who has 40 years of experience in hospital, nursing home and private home care I know that medication administration is handled by a licensed nurse; RN or LPN. Unless there was a doctor's order for each and every medication; prescription or OTC on the patient's chart that the patient may keep those medications at her bedside and self administer, then this is inappropriate. 

I will say that most facilities try very hard to provide good care but when they pay so poorly it's nearly impossible to attract and retain the best staff. It's all about the bottom line."
2021-03-13 18:54:16,"As an insider let me give you a clue. The public barely knows the tip of the iceberg. Their elected representatives, over the past 15 years have allowed private equity companies and entities whose only priority is maximizing profit to control their doctors medical decisions based on cost....its laughable how dysfunctional the government is in watching out for the public who put them their. But in this time of everyone doing what is best for them, and only them, this is what you end up with and the best part is that it's almost impossible to be reversed or dismantled because of ownership rights. Some industries, like fire departments and healthcare need to be protected from for profit private ownership...and they were....until this last generation of politicians and the media which does their bidding. My advice, have someone in your family go to medical school so they can watch out for you no one else will."
2021-03-13 18:55:48,"Nursing homes are for profit businesses.

As a schoolboy in the 1950’s I remember being taught about the American Dream, the heartfelt hopes of Europeans fleeing tyranny, seeking a fairer life in the USA. In time, it woulf became the dream of immigrants from every country in the world.
I was taught how courageous, hard-working immigrants hugged one another, and wept and laughed. How they sang the beautiful hymns of their homelands as they approached the American coast.

The American Dream, as taught then, consisted of two noble, closely-related goals.
1. Complete religious freedom. Including the freedom to have no religion. In this, the individual decides. The government has no say.
2. Equal justice under the law. Class, wealth, religion, ethnicity do not matter. Justice is blind. In America, justice is fairly applied to all.

I mention the post-WWII American Dream in relation to this disturbing article about “for profit” nursing homes because the American Dream has changed.
Listen to politicians and radio talk shows. Pay attention to the parade of speakers at the Republican National Convention.
“And the pushcart peddlar’s son opened his own small store. And his son became a policeman. And the cop’s daughter — a high school teacher. Then an engineer. A scientist. And finally, a Silicon Valley billionaire. 
“That’s the dream! Americans growing ever wealthier.”

So long as the American Dream is of money, we will be reading of for-profit nightmares.
No goodness comes from GREED."
2021-03-13 18:57:22,"No surprise here.  When my father was in rehab facility (he had to be in one twice) the first things that were done were to give him medication to keep him quiet and docile.  This was not done for his safety or well being.  It was done for the convenience of the staff.  When my mother was in rehab at a well known facility they left her alone for 2-3 hours after her admission.  She needed to use the toilet.  They yelled at her for going by herself.  Of course she did ring the bell but no one came.  She didn't want to soil herself so she risked re-fracturing her hip in order to use the toilet.  When I visited her I overheard the staff making nasty comments about her.  And this was at a good facility.

As with the rest of the wealth care industry the for profit motive gets in the way of giving patients decent care or, to be honest, halfway decent care.  We treat our pets better and that's sad.  rich.  Medicare and insurance do not cover the real costs of caring for anyone who is elderly and in need of more than one or two hours of help. This will, at some point be most of us.

Sadly enough this is typical of every rating system in America.  We don't get to see the real results until it's too late. Every person deserves to be treated with dignity.  And every nursing home that skimps on care and underpays employees to keep profits high should be put out of business."

2021-03-13 17:47:16,"I affirm what is written here and long before COVID19. I had to put an elderly aunt into Assisted Living (after several hospitalizations for falls, rehab etc.). It was a nightmare. She paid $$$$ to stay in a ""5 star"" facility that was a joke. 

I reported them numerous times to the State Ombudsman, State Board of Health, BBB, even State Attorney General to little or not effect. Whenever they sent a representative... amazingly the facility found out a few days in advance, and ran around to ""correct the problems"" (in this case, unclean rooms, missing smoke detectors, no light bulbs (!), patient not being bathed and their toenail not cut for months on end, dirty clothing, missed meals, etc.) and I was made out to look like an interfering fool.

By the time my aunt passed, the facility was subtly (or NOT SO subtly) implying they would get lawyers to take POA away from me, because ""only they knew what was in my 93 year old, senile aunt's best interest"" -- i.e., lots of drugs, unnecessary doctor visits, big bills.

I witness the most awful stuff -- bedbugs run rampant -- crying patients overlooked for meals -- patients left in bed all day without food -- medications spilled and laying on the floor -- filthy furniture and carpets -- with no power to do anything about it. I reported and reported and reported. 

You can't have any effect over a billion dollar corporations. This is not health care. This is a vast, powerful scam for ""wealth extraction"" from seniors."

That said, we have a tacit understanding that death within our own home, surrounded by familiar loved ones and the environment we know, is light years more appropriate and desirable to languishing in a nursing home.

They are run by a system of equity investors who set up a Byzantine layer of corporations that bill each other for maximum profits . Most all medical records , activity records are fake . We have a posted calendar of amazing activities none of which ever take place . The food is basically industrial minimum security prison . We had three spreader covid events in our facility. All of which were handled with criminal neglect . At one point last year the staff and residents were forbidden from wearing masks . The major hospitals continued to dump covid patients into our facility for months . The company will take anyone with a check .

Not only that, but it was better for my grandma to effectively go bankrupt than keep paying her medical bills.  Luckily my mom was able to help her, but many nursing home residents are not so lucky.

2021-03-13 19:15:18,"""Nursing homes have manipulated the influential star system in ways that have masked deep problems""

Similar to how the food industry freely manipulates definitions of such wordings as ""cage free,"" ""open range,"" ""natural"" and a host of other words that essentially have no meaning these days so far as what is printed on the packaging of food items.

In the Reagan administration they tried to foist on us the insanity that ketchup counted as a vegetable in school lunches.

2021-03-13 19:16:31,"When we placed my father in an assisted living facility replete with fancy furniture, drapes and chandeliers to please the children, management insisted we pay more for extra care.  While he was not doing so well physically, he was still mentally very sharp.  When we asked him if the two paid-for aides helped him out of bed and dress in the morning or help him open other ways, his consistent answer was that only one aide was present.  The night before he passed away, I arrived at the facility to find him slumped in a wheelchair in the corner of the lobby with absolutely no one paying attention.  We heard similar stories from many others with elderly parents in different facilities.

If you want to know why the elder care industry in America is so broken, it’s because the players have bribed politicians at every level to look the other way.  Pick any state with elder care issues and then look at the list of contributors to the governor and state legislators.  It’s not rocket science."
2021-03-13 19:16:38,"The most comprehensive investigative reporting I’ve seen to date on the all too frequently misleading and deceptive “5-Star” rating system in U.S. nursing homes.

The star rating system has value for residents and their families but only as a crude indicator of the quality of care and safety in each of the over 15,000 nursing homes nationwide. It consists of many gaps and it’s prone to manipulation. With this largely self-report rating system, nursing homes basically “oversee” and rate themselves.

The article has various implications for residents and families limited ability to make “informed choice” when selecting a nursing home. 

It includes compelling examples of “understatement” (severity ratings lower than they should be) and chronic underreporting of neglect, falls, pressure ulcers, etc.

It also has concerning implications on researchers’ ability (or the lack of there of) to conduct research studies using the (frequently unreliable) 5-star rating system...

CMS shouldn’t have allowed nursing homes to get away with so much strategic deception for so many years... In many cases, it should be considered outright fraud.

It begs the question: Who, if any, regulates the regulators?

I call it “Nested Neglect.”

When CMS neglects its responsibility, it creates the fertile conditions for neglect, abuse, and financial exploitation of vulnerable and frail residents most with dementia to occur but remain invisible, literally, in nursing homes."
2021-03-13 19:21:06,"Data is important and thanks to those that did the research about nursing homes to write this article. The problem is that anyone who has had the misfortune of having to choose a nursing home for someone, has worked in a nursing  home, or even knows someone that was in a nursing home already knows that the rating system is bogus.   Basically, the data proves what we already know, many if not most nursing homes are a disgrace. 
Sadly, the same is more or less true about hospital rating systems too. The article states that many nursing homes are aware of when site visits are scheduled and prepare, temporarily, accordingly.  Hospitals do the same thing. Weeks and months are spent in prep for site visits: cleaning, organization, getting rid of expired meds and supplies, etc, etc., only to revert to many of the old practices after the inspection. 
Now what?  Do we have the societal wherewithal to address this?   
Oh, and using Cuomo as the scapegoat?  Well, his hands are dirty for sure, but he is just a drop in the ocean with respect to how we got to where we are today."
2021-03-13 19:22:57,"Now please do a story on the quality of care provided in assisted living facilities. They are not regulated by the federal government and there are ten of them for every nursing home and five times as many residents. Here in Wisconsin despite dramatic improvements in state-level oversight they are still not required to report staffing levels or report on the condition of residents. Residents supposedly have fewer care needs and less complex medical conditions, but the incentive to fill beds  inevitably leads to the admission of people the facilities are simply not qualified to care for. Moral: Before you reject the nursing home be sure you are clear-eyed about the alternatives."
2021-03-13 19:23:56,"There are loving, underpaid and overworked medical assistants performing the bulk of the bedside care at rehab, assisted living and long-term care facilities.  Many are immigrants from countries that honor their elderly.  Unfortunately, these assistants are limited in the critical thinking skills required to assess if a resident is acutely ill to report this to a licensed staff member who also may be lacking critical thinking skills to assess acuity to determine if primary or emergency care is needed.  Strict infection control protocol prior to the pandemic was most likely unknown and the rapid spread of COVID-19 in long-term care facilities revealed this.  

Many decades ago, I was a nursing assistant in a long-term care facility (prior to becoming an RN), and the cases of fist-deep, decubiti ulcers, contractures, malnutrition and other preventable issues due to inappropriate care, lack of care and neglect due to insufficient staffing was shocking.  What is truly shocking is these issues still occur in long-term care. Families of loved ones in these facilities are justifiably  unable to manage the 24 hour 7 days a week care of debilitation, and have an expectation that these places will provide the care needed to keep their loved ones safe.

If these atrocious issues were exposed in an animal shelter, it would make headline news, cause an uproar and be corrected.  How the rich business managers of these ""human care"" facilities  sleep at night is unfathomable."

2021-03-13 19:27:09,"The nursing home industry, like insurance, prescription drug and other healthcare industries, is utterly broken because profit margins and cost avoidance are prioritized above everything else. These industries are broken because the companies who operate within them are built on a for-profit model. When care decisions are made via corporate board members’ votes, executive annual bonus incentive structures and keeping shareholders happy and invested, is it any wonder that the human beings in their care suffer? Corporations are people now, but they don’t see us as people anymore, they see us as beasts of burden, like oxen or carriage horses. We are made to work our entire lives to stuff their pockets, then they neglect us at the very end while leaving most of us with nothing thanks to the criminally absurd cost of nursing home care.

2021-03-13 19:29:24,"Last Thanksgiving, my 88 year old father got COVID. He spent a month at the Cleveland Clinic. His second month was at a 5 star rated rehabilitation center, Broadview Multi-Care Center in Parma, Ohio. It is a for profit facility and a wholly owned subsidiary of Legacy Health Services.

My Dad kept pulling out his feeding tube. They finally called me and said that they would have to cut a hole in his stomach and put a feeding tube through his abdomen. I said, “No way.” They told me he would die of aspiration pneumonia if I didn’t do it. I reiterated that they weren’t cutting a hole in his stomach. They told me I had to take him home and put him in hospice. Evidently the corporate bottom line doesn’t allow for the time intensive spoon feeding that is required to recover from Covid related dysphagia.

Now he is under the hospice care of St. Augustine Health Ministries, a non profit, faith based, end of life care community. He may be slowly dying, but he is comfortable and happy, and he is receiving better care now than he has ever had in his life, and that includes his 40 year stint as a patient of the Cleveland Clinic Factory for Industrialized Medicine.

So if we can dump a few trillion dollars into the economy to recover from Covid, can’t we also direct that aid to support institutions like St. Augustine and put places like Legacy Health Services out of business?

I worked in a tertiary care hospital. I could talk for hours about nursing homes with their games, two faced marketing, lies, cover ups, money grubbing ways and unethical behavior.

If we paid these workers a living wage and cut the wages of administrators and shady behind the scene for profit corporations, I guarantee we would see better outcomes for patients. 

I worked briefly as a CNA at a nursing home while going to nursing school. I was so tired, so scared with how much responsibility I had (taking care of 7-10 patients, the majority of them requiring total care), and thought every day about resigning.

2021-03-13 19:40:47,"This is a great collection of data on nursing ""homes"". 

California has tried and then a governor, Jerry Brown, moved to repeal, veto or unilaterally changed a public policy in California which gave disabled people, young adults to older adults to right to live at home and not in a nursing facility.  It allowed the disabled to live on a modicum of aid directed at their cost of living (rent/utilities/care/medicine).  The costs, the disabled argued are far less than the State's funding of   these horrible places.  

Without going into some facts, such as the overall smell of human urine in the best of nursing homes in the hallways, * 1 having a patient in a home environment is infinitely better. 

Families, state and county governments, and the medical insurers need to work on home-care as a solution to this wretched problem. 

Governor Brown changed funding of in-home care to nursing home care, I believe, because doing so balanced the State Budget.  He also threw the disabled under the bus.  The most vulnerable of our society are always sacrificed in government budgets."

Medicare daily reimbursement much higher than Medicaid, which is why many long term beds being converted to short term. However, for people who have been discharged from hospital with serious issues, like open wound Ms Johnson had, you have to be VERY careful where you go, as only a tiny percentage of these places has medical sophistication to deal with something like that. May have been gross negligence on part of BOTH hospital and nursing home for her to go there if they knew was likely facility couldn't deal with that type of issue, no matter how many stars it had."

2021-03-13 19:45:11,"The problem is that private equity firms are buying up healthcare institutions and the personnel within them. Most healthcare personnel have to have at least a 4 year degree, which means they are not covered by labor laws, hence their work day can be as long as 24 hours.  My longest “day” working was 32 hours straight for which I was paid 16 hours (2 days x 8 hours per day). Private equity is purchasing physicians practices, Dental practices, EEG technicians practices, laboratory services and their personnel, scrub techs, physical therapy practices, you name it. The only way to cut costs is to make people work longer hours but pay them for an 8-hour-per-day salary; or cut staff. Often, medical personnel are 1099’d.  It’s everywhere, not just nursing homes.  Healthcare administrators are presented with proposals to cut their costs by employing these contract firms and the contract firms are willing to underbid each other to get the contract.  Nursing homes, dental practices, nursing services usually start out with somebody in the business providing the service. Eventually their business merges or is acquired by private equity and salaries or staff are reduced. That’s the future."

It does not take a law professor (which I am) to figure that out. One month before she died, I brought her home to  pass in her familiar surrounding (with round the clock care for a few weeks). It was a decision I am more than happy I made. 

For curiosity , I just checked the rating of one of those homes. It is five stars. But in reading the details one can see that that figure does not reflect reality . Staffing is only ""average"" and some of the factors listed are above the state averages. I fail to see how it could be five stars."
2021-03-13 18:17:01,"I’ve worked in 8 nursing homes. The worst hell hole was in Brooklyn NY.  It was a fraud factory.  People kept in wheel chairs who were able to walk, medicare billed for therapy that was never done, feeding tubes shoved into people to allow the facility to make more money, and short term rehab patients who were ready and able to go home being told they had to stay 100 days so the facility could get every medicare penny out of them. Nobody gave a damn about these people.  They asked me every day to find out when they could go. They got the run around. Social workers threatened them with losing any transition services if they left.  It was horrible. And it was a Medicare Rated 5 Star Facility."

Talking about her lunch, she accidentally said ""peanut butter and belly"" and we both laughed. Then we both laughed even harder when I told her that, by coincidence, I was also having peanut butter and belly for lunch! She explained that due to the decline in Covid cases the residents are now allowed (after many months) to eat together in the dining room, but with plastic shields separating people from each other. She sounded quite happy this  morning. That is not always the case, but she was not always happy when she was living with  us, either.

My mother is very fortunate to be in that particular nursing home, but it should be understood that some of these places are really not that bad.

No-so-good angle: My mother's care is very, very expensive. However, if we were unable to pay, Medicaid would be picking that up, after she had spent down all her assets. That may yet happen."

The bottom line is the bottom line: if you want good care, it costs a huge amount of money residents can't pay and society is unwilling to, starting with far better training, compensating, and regulation of employees. I've known a lot of people in nursing and assisted care, and the for-profits, whether old ones or fancy new ones in exclusive suburbs, are almost all horrible--the places with ethical traditions derived from mainline denominations (e.g. a presbyterian home) are the only ones I've see that have an ethic of good care, and not all of them do.

2021-03-13 20:10:52,"I worked as a CNA in a luxury nursing home in CT and this article hit far too close to home. All I can say is - the only differences between the five-star facilities and the ones with lower ratings are the décor and the price tag.  

My facility was constantly understaffed and I often found myself taking care of 15+ residents on 16 hour shifts. I wanted more than anything to be able to spend more time with my patients and be more thorough with my care, but there was simply too much to be done and I was always rushing off to get to the next person in time. Staff turnover was ridiculously high given the amount of work and the abysmal pay (not to mention that there were rarely raises or any sort of incentives to encourage people to stay).  We were told that the facility couldn't afford to pay us more - and all the while, the executives spent hundreds of thousands on parties, decorated the place to look like a resort hotel, and generously padded their own salaries.  

As for the inspections...we always knew when they were coming, and we were told to go out of our way to make things look better than normal. It was the same whenever a potential new resident was coming to visit, especially the sales rep knew they had money to spend. Extra staff were scheduled to work, special activities were scheduled, better food was served, etc. The theatrics were utterly ridiculous.  

I'm not in the industry anymore, but it still breaks my heart to think about. It needs to change, and soon."

The nursing staff has to be more engaged in direct patient care. When that happens, nursing assistance generally responds positively because they are viewed as part of a team, not just them doing the lion's share of the work while nurses appear to be only interested in administrative duties. Treating staff as equals regardless of rank goes a very long way. A reasonable schedule can also make the difference in getting everyone to cooperate; every other weekend off is doable if presented in a way that all are responsible for maintaining adequate staffing and if that fails, the burden reverts back to a less appealing work schedule. I was fortunate to have been successful in initiating such a plan. Simply, treat people how you yourself want to be treated."

2021-03-13 20:48:04,"I had spinal fusion surgery in September, after which I was sent to a 5-star rehab hospital. Previously I had been in the same facility after a knee replacement and it was OK on the rehab unit and physical therapy was first rate. Covid changed everything--many of the older, experienced nurses aids had left, and the facility was left short staffed. In addition, many of the staff had been replaced by 18-19 year old aids, who were not practicing safe PPE, and there was no compliance person on the floor to monitor them. As the result, I ended up getting MRSA while in the facility. I was transferred back to hospital where I underwent an additional 2 surgeries, and have still not completed wound treatment. 

While I was there I heard from one of the RN's that the facility had underreported their Covid deaths by Cuomo math--29 patients died, and only 19 were reported. Additionally, I am not able to take legal action against the facility because of a release I didn't know I had signed guaranteeing the facility from any legal action on my part.

Where I used to work in a related industry, staff were paid at or just above the minimum wage. They started off at about 8 dollars and were promised about 50 cents extra after 6 months etc. Imagine working at minimum wage or even 10 an hour, bathing another human being, cooking for them, feeding them etc, for 10 or less an hour. They have to work overtime just to make ends meet. Without overtime I made roughly about 500 in two weeks. Every time I read or hear about these problems I don’t see any mention of how much the staff are so underpaid! It’s as if the staff aren’t human beings or don’t exist! If we want great care, we sure don’t show it by how much we pay!! We love to complain about the care, but we never mention how much we pay the carers! We seem to love pretending that we’ve paid for better care! We want five star service while paying for 1 star or less service! You find immigrants, or minorities etc in this field. If I were looking for a good indicator of quality, I’d ask how much the carers get paid! It’s sad, but we get what we pay for! If we want to have better care, we have to pay for it. And, please, let’s not say the usual excuse “we can’t solve the problem by ‘throwing’ money at it!” The pay matters! A great deal!! If our carers are treated like slaves, we can’t expect them to care for our loved ones like royals!!!"

2021-03-13 20:56:43,"I’d like to offer another perspective to this discussion. I am a physician currently working solely in a long term care facility with a short term rehab unit. I love this work- our patients are absolutely delightful people with rich histories and complex and challenging medical problems. For years I’ve spent far more time providing care for these patients (hands on, collecting information, and documenting) than I am compensated for, because that’s what the job requires- the histories are long, the issues are completely, and records are hard to obtain (so much for the online “medical information super-highway”). 
I am fortunate that I can afford to do this - the majority of the health care work force can’t. Medicare and Medicaid (and most other insurances follow their lead) continue to systematically chisel down compensation for services across the board, resulting in less time, thought, and diligent care provided to all patients in offices, emergency departments, and hospitals. Sadly, the short-changing of patients is system wide. That being said, I have resigned from for-profit facilities for ethically-suspicious actions when facing a financial loss. In my experience, a well run nonprofit facility is the far better option."
2021-03-13 20:57:38,"The nursing home horror story is a genre as old as institutional care for the elderly is, a thing we should interpret in light of the overwhelmingly complex needs and poor prognoses often seen in this population. Issues with quality can affect nonprofits as well as commercial facilities; two employees at Holyoke Soldiers’ Home in Massachusetts faced charges after 80 Covid deaths among residents there. Truth here is while most homes provide decent care, lapses occur at nearly all of them, and some of them really are bad.

AARP tells us the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services “stars” rating is only a place to start, for which U.S. News & World Report magazine offers an annual list covering 15000 homes as a convenience to readers. But they’re no substitute for a thorough, in-person visit, best conducted well in advance of need. Meeting with a social worker who does elder care placements to get recommendations is also wise; these workers may be attached to hospitals or state agencies on aging, or in private practice.

One sad thing in all this is that so many of our seniors lacking the ability to investigate homes for themselves also have no family or friends to rely on. I suspect the American isolation of old age encourages abuses."

I had my sister in 4 different rehab facilities over a two year period in 2 states and the reality is dismal, enraging, and boarders on criminal. If you have a loved one in a care facility, you have a new full time job! Daily scrutiny is the only way to ensure even a minimal level of care. Active micromanagement is required to get nursing or physicians attention at all. And the biggest issue is meals .. they are BAD! Nutrition is so vital to the elderly for maintenance and recovery that the only way to make that happen is to bring in at least 2 of the daily meals. Scrutinize drugs and dosage and be sure your familiar with the staff that administers them. They almost killed my sister because I was not involved enough since I believed in the quality ratings. She now lives with me and if we need help, it will be provided in home. I am sure the same fictional ratings is also the standard for hospitals, although their care is exceptional in comparison."
2021-03-13 21:00:11,"This article literally brought me to tears for many reasons. First, thanks to the amazing and wonderful care provided by my younger sister, my mother never spent a single day in a nursing home, which we knew was just a place old people were sent to die when relatives were unable or unwilling to provide care for their aged loved ones. However, my mom did spend many days in facilities such as these for short-term rehab, and because of that, I'm quite familiar with the terrible conditions described throughout this article. My sister and I worked diligently to remove my mother from her stints in rehab as quickly as was medically possible--and for that effort, I hope, my mother suffered much less. My experience with the rehab facilities, which also function as long-term facilities, was similar to the experiences of many described in this article.  Evidence of under-staffing, administrative indifference, lack of equipment, was obvious. And it's just as obvious that these awful conditions are due to the for-profit scheme of these institutions. But what's not addressed in this article is what allows these institutions to flourish in the first place. Our own inability to care for our aging/dying relatives, whether due to financial, medical, or moral deficiencies, along with a medical industry that tries to extend our lives for as long as we remain financially valuable to them, are the culprits. We have no idea what to do with ourselves, or our relatives, once we become old and infirm."

It was around the time they were being conglomerized...it was so sick...  it turns my stomach to this day.

Looking online one day for a way to seek relief, improvement, I came across some corporate websites describing what a great investment that was... no wonder, staff were continually shrinking, after a 5-hour course, teenagers were licensed to dispense medication (you should have seen their glazed eyes), upkeep, maintenance, forget it...I won't go on.

2021-03-13 21:09:43,"Thank you New York Times for this eye opening report.
In my experience dealing with two different facilities, I have a few of observations.

Firstly, for the most part, the nurses and aides were some of the warmest, most caring people one could ever want to meet.  Obviously, from the article, this isn't always the case given the horrific incidents described.  But most of the staff I met were genuinely loving and caring people who treated residents well.

Secondly, my complaints were with the administrators who seemed incentivized to push up the monthly charges.  At  successively higher levels of care costing substantially more on a monthly basis, residents didn't seem to receive any more staff time.  In particular, moving from AL to LTC can cost about three-fold and yet the amount of care seemed to decrease.  Furthermore, the administrators pushed for establishing hospice care (probably warranted), only to drop their own in-house staffing levels once hospice was on board.  I bring this up only because the NYT article focused much attention on this metric.  My own experience made me wonder how hospice involvement is taken into consideration in assessing staffing levels at a facility.

Thirdly, in addition to greater oversight of these facilities, it seems some changes to Medicare are also warranted.  There is a 100 day annual limit for physical therapy and a requirement to show 'progress'.  However, routinely patients seem limited to only about 30 days of therapy."

My wife said she was very concerned she could lose her nursing license if protocol did not change. A week later her supervisor came to her and said NYC was not going to offer any help. She was on her own. She resigned and moved into a similar position at a large local hospital. The group of nursing homes she left have been under scrutiny by inspectors ever since. I talk with family members of the residents and not one has had a good word to say. There was an incident recently where  a woman/client fell at the facility where my wife had her office.

When asked whether their numbers were adjusted to reflect staffers out sick on any given day, there was no response. Getting no satisfaction from the site director, I thought I’d reach out to higher ups, only to discover the company was owned by a private equity firm listed as a PO Box in the Bahamas.

Top top things off, it is not required of LTC workers to get the covid vaccine, after LTC facilities have been a battleground for this virus. So, the places will continue to go on lockdown until this happens, and the residents are the ones who pay the price. There needs to be regulation for these facilities, and laws that protect them, us. the greater good."
2021-03-13 21:21:23,Capitalism at its worse. This is a for profit venture. This means the cheapest overhead with the least employees. The staff is a revolving door of underpaid and overworked individuals. I worked as an aide over 40 years ago and then witnessed a family member in a facility. Things have not changed one bit regardless of regulations and fines. The solution is higher pay for the staff so facilities can attract and retain trained people and enough staff to meet the needs of the residents. Of course this cuts into profits.
2021-03-13 21:26:29,"Not sure if any commenters have talked about the campaign donations by long-term-care owners (esp. the for-profit ones) to state legislators & administrators.

The “regulators” are told in one way or another to go easy on these places.


My parent had issues similar to Ms. Johnson’s in his 3 years in one of the for-profit places in suburban Northeast Ohio.  The industry is a shameful reflection on our priorities as a nation."

2021-03-13 21:40:41,"I was in a car accident when I was 65; breaking both legs and an arm.  After surgery I was released to a rehab center for  weeks to recuperate.  I was placed in a room with a comatose person.

although bedridden, I was able to use a bedpan and feed myself.  There was no assistance offered so I could bathe.  There seemed to be no schedule for when they attended to the other person in the room.  ,  

Prior to discharge they started coming to my room demanding money.  First they claimed I missed the bill they sent.  I asked how that was possible since I was transported there from the hospital after the accident.  

A few days later they sent someone with a 27-page contract demanding that I sign. I read enough to understand that I would be waiving all rights and agreeing to pay anything they wanted to charge.  Because I had insurance, I declined.  They let me know they were unhappy with me.

Next, someone called me and said they needed $5,000 immediately.  I asked where I would get $5,000.  They told me they didn't care.  Borrow it.  Whatever.  They told me it was against their policy to allow me to receive physical therapy if I didn't pay it.  Since I had a private orthopedic surgeon and knew I was being discharged shortly, I let it go.

I went home and started outpatient 5X a week P.T. to regain my mobility.  5+ yrs later I'm still walking to stay strong.  

These places prey on people if they can't take care of themselves; and isn't that why most people are there?"
2021-03-13 21:41:20,"What’s been happening in these facilities is immoral, heartbreaking, unacceptable. So many nursing homes are dangerously understaffed, and at the same time, have too many residents. 
Our seniors see nursing homes nowadays not as places where they can spend the rest of their lives comfortably when living independently is no longer an option, or have good physical therapy in order to eventually return home, but instead as places where their health problems will worsen and their limited life expectancy will be cut short. Of course, there are exceptions and some places are better than others.
Nursing homes have a very important role to play in the near future, with an aging population, increasing cancer survival, and the fact that families are less equipped today to take care of their elders. To complicate matters even more, social security is expected to become insolvent by 2030, and Medicare will face a similar problem around 2026; oh, and the US has a low birth rate, so we are going to have to figure something out if we want to not only fund long term care for our seniors, but also to appropriately staff the facilities. 
How can we fix the nursing home care mess? Congress needs to act. Why isn’t anyone considering federally-owned nursing homes? They are likely to lead to way better outcomes and potentially save millions. As long as most nursing homes here in the US are profit-oriented, the problems will continue and become worse in the near future."
2021-03-13 21:42:58,This is another perfect example of why essential services should not be delivered by the private sector.  The profit motive and greed are just too strong and will overwhelm the need to provide adequate care.  Business and entrepreneurs are great at execution but cannot and should not be expected to set and adhere to public policy.  Competent and independent oversight is essential to make sure that the rules are followed.  But a better solution is to take these life and death matters out of their hands.
2021-03-13 21:44:23,"It’s the system we live in. Private equities bought up properties in the last crash and rented them out sometimes to the same people who lost them (hooray for the Kushners). Private equity companies run prisons and charter schools. They sell food and telephone time at exorbitant rates while paying prisoners pennies per hour for their labor. They buy up the land under trailer parks running up monthly rental rates. The family farm is a myth. Huge companies control farming and the dangerous, disgusting practices used to raise and slaughter animals. We’ve just seen what happened to the privately run power system in Texas. We’ve seen the end of the private doctor’s office. Practices have been bought up by huge hospital systems. Why should nursing homes be exempt? We’re all only as important as the amount of money we can make for someone else. What’s worse is the complicity of government in enabling these practices. We’re now getting an inkling of how that works in New York."
2021-03-13 21:47:26,"Four years ago, my mom unexpectedly went to the hospital, then to short-term rehab, then to a long-term facility. After 6 weeks at the short-term, I knew enough to move her to a different long-term place. The first place was nice looking and had great ads, but was terrible. The second place, although not as nicely looking, had great staff that genuinely cared. They were both short staffed, but the second place had Catholic sisters, who volunteered at the place, who supplemented spending time with the residents. 

At both places, I went every single day for a total of 6 months to check on my mom. That’s how I knew how good/bad the place was. My general observation was that my mom didn’t really need to be in a facility. I ended up buying a house so I could have a place to bring my mom home to. I’m single and still maintain a full-time corporate career. Care-at-home aids were not good either, so I switched to hiring college girls to come by to hang out with my mom for a couple hours a day. That was pre-COVID. I’ve been working from home since and taking care of mom, who has dementia and uses a walker. 

None of this has been easy, but I read stuff like this, and I am thank God that my mom isn’t in a nursing home. As it gets harder, I pray I won’t have to put her in one again, either."
2021-03-13 21:50:54,"I could share horror stories of what I've seen when family members were in LTC or AL, like everyone else commenting here. Everything in this article is true. One facility my brother was in actually put up signs saying inspectors were coming, reminding staff and visitors to spiff up the place! And the medical director, the only doctor the residents were allowed to see unless they got sent to the hospital, had a full-time medical practice during the day and ONLY visited the LTC/AL facility in the middle of the night, and rarely at that. And he was a part-owner of the facility, which to me feels like a conflict of interest. I dread the day I can't take care of my physical needs or lose mental capacity. No amount of $ guarantees you good care in these places."
2021-03-13 21:53:16,"thank you NYT for delving deeply into what go stories that wees on behind these closed doors.
My mother had brain damage due to surgery from an aneurysm and was a resident in nursing homes for 16 years before she died. a couple of them were such true horror stories, that we rescued her as soon as we discovered the situations she was in.
It was already devastating enough to loose the mother i had known before the surgery and then to  have to put her in a facility that didn't care about her welfare...whew.
not to mention lack of dental care.
if i had the option to go back and have a do-over, i would only choose a not-for-profit nursing home.  NOT a for-profit home.  there should not be nursing businesses that care first and foremost about their bottom line.

2021-03-13 21:54:48,"Unfortunately, I had the experience of dealing with several different nursing homes in Brooklyn and Manhattan before my mother passed away. Each place was just terrible. The short term rehab is maybe a total of 30 minutes a day with the rest of the day sitting in a wheelchair. It’s a joke. If you have no money and no family to take care of you, this is where you end up as a long term care patient."

Please everyone, the other message is that if your parent or loved one must go into a nursing home, you have to be there. EVERY day. As much of the day as possible.

Get exercise everyday, it doesn't have to be horrible, just walk 10-20 minutes or more if you are fit enough.  Do some chair exercises to strengthen the thigh muscles so you can get up and down out of a chair.  Do some stretching, a little in the morning and a little at night before bed.  Visualize pleasant places or memories, avoid negative or violent ""entertainment"" TV and movies. Be grateful for whatever you have, a good cup of tea, peace and quiet.  Other things are good friends, pets, Sudoku or crossword puzzles, etc.  Challenge yourself every day to accomplish something, even if it's just to wash your hair or change your bedsheets.  You don't have to overdo, gauge your efforts to YOUR life, not somebody else's and don't judge yourself or put yourself down.  You're at where you're at, it's OK.

2021-03-13 21:45:38,"Great work, NYT! I have a few more questions for you.

So if nursing homes cheated on their data that they reported to CMS to keep their star rating, how do we know they didn’t also misreport their COVID-19 death data to the NY Department of Health (DOH) last year? 

Why did some nursing homes increase their Covid death data numbers later, and only when the OAG asked for that same data months later? Is it because the Office of the Attorney General is the ONLY law enforcement agency in the state specifically mandated to investigate and prosecute abuse and neglect of residents in nursing homes? 

In the Jan. 28 OAG preliminary report on Nursing Home Response to COVID-19 Pandemic, the report notes that preliminary data reflects apparent underreporting TO the DOH by some nursing homes of resident deaths occurring in nursing homes. This needs further investigation, and I look forward to the final report from the OAG. Cuomo’s people were right to question the NH data, and to delay reporting questionable numbers until they were properly audited. 

With so few nurses on staff, even before the pandemic, perhaps it is time we stop referring to them as “Nursing Homes.”"
2021-03-13 22:11:55,"Thank you for this expose.  We put my mom into a nursing home near us about 18 months ago. She had dementia and could no longer care for herself. 

The facility was beautiful and it seemed well staffed. The nurses and assistants were polite and patient. Mom was there for about 6 months and she had no complaints. (My wife and/ or I visited her several times a week.) After she had a stroke (at age 92), we had to move her to hospice, next to Mayo Clinic in Florida. In both places my mom was treated extremely well. (My wife and I got to know the staff in both places.)

When mom died at hospice, the undertaker came to the facility to lift her from her bed and place her on the rolling table to bring her outside. As we exited the facility together, each staff member rose from their seat and stood up respectfully and silently, as my mom wheeled past them, out to the hearse. It was very touching. 

The facility has a 4-star rating on the Medicare site. It cost about $6,000 a month. I would give it five stars."

2021-03-13 22:16:46,"The purpose of nursing homes is to funnel money from whoever pays for care (mainly Uncle Sam and the taxpayer dollars raised from the general public) to investors in the private equity firms that increasingly own them.  These firms knew or learned from other firms that the star system could be manipulated to increase profits so that the homes would be good investments.  Part of these profits would be used to buy these manipulations and conceal them.  

Private equity firms are run by people who see and measure only money.  They know that their profiteering must be concealed, but the history of Purdue Pharma shows how easy and profitable this is.  They must also not kill so many residents that they cannot keep their beds occupied, but there are enough elderly people incapable of living on their own that this has not yet become a problem.

If these firms are made less profitable, they will take their money and their ethics somewhere else and bring about a nursing home crisis that they can and will blame on government regulation and anti-business prejudice.  No level of government wants this mess uncovered because it makes them look bad.  It does not make the nursing home owners and managers look bad, at least to conservatives, because they are just acting like normal businesses.  If the homes must take in people who cannot pay for their own care out of their own pockets, at least some of the money is going into the pockets of investors where it belongs."

Most often licensed staff as regulated by the state is limited to 1 RN who supervises 2-3 LPNs per 100-125 resident patients while bedside care is provided by non-licensed staff. This is especially true on nights and weekends when even unlicensed staff is at a minimal level and why their charges lie wet and soiled for hours and never get turned. The nurses sit at the station and document leaving to pass meds and check on situations that they rather not know about. While there are homes that are exemplary; most are not with huge staff turnover and poor morale. Those who stay are highly dedicated, paid below par, and for many reasons cannot leave for greener pastures as are older and lack the credentials and stamina that hospital bedside nursing demands."

My mother was in a short-term rehab unit for a few weeks following an emergency hip replacement surgery 8 years ago. At the time, her primary care doctor told me the non-profit facilities tended to be better than the for-profit nursing homes. So I scrambled to research the best local option in the area, with backup choices in case my first choice was full. 

She was right. I was able to get her into the NH we wanted, and her doctor did make in-person visits with her on a weekly basis. But after spending hours there daily, every day during her stay, I was convinced the best solution for her longer term care was to stay at home for as long as possible. So we bought a stairlift, added grab bars and a few small other pieces of equipment, and back home we went. 

With the help of a home-care agency, and some limited help from my family, we were able to cobble together a flexible schedule solution that kept her safe, happy and as healthy as possible for her four remaining years. Had she lived through 2020, I shudder to think of what care decisions I would have had to face during this pandemic."
2021-03-13 20:50:52,"RN here,
Unfortunately, health care has become a business. This is a true statement, 70% of nursing homes are now owned by private equities and that these Goliath businesses are allowed to put money before the welfare of the vulnerable elderly is not kosher. Are we going to forget what happened in a NJ nursing home during the Covid-19 crisis in April 2020–– with bodies stacked one on top of the other? This NJ home was run by private equity. Did they get a slap on the hand? What happened here? As a nurse, I would like to know. 

Another biggie: Private equity is in hospitals as well. HCA and Tenet are leaders.These hospitals put profits over patients. It is about greed. The largest government fraud settlement I know about in history was HCA–––Hospital Corporation of America. Read this if interested about HCA: The health care company & Subsidiaries to pay $840 million in criminal Fines and civil damages and Penalties. www.usdoj.gov, and dated Dec 14,2000. In healthcare we have gone downhill since this criminal act. The CEO at the helm of this conglomerate at the time was Rick Scott. He is now a US senator in Florida, and a former governor of Florida. How do we allow this to continue? All this fraud should be public knowledge. The fraudulent CEO's are now in government? What does this mean for US citizens?

2021-03-13 22:22:07,"The nursing home my mother attended was expensive, offered tiny rooms, and very little one on one time.  As I recall, back then it was about $400/day.  She had taken out a NYS nursing home insurance policy and as a result she had to pay more than those using government funding.   I would love to understand where all that money went.  I would love to understand why she had so little space and one on one time.

I expect regulations may make it impossible to provide care at 
much more of an affordable rate.  If it was a free market industry, I can't imagine it costing that much for a tiny room, meals, and little one on one time.  Many of the people who do non medical tasks like change bedding are very low paid.  So where does the money go.  I would love to see a cost breakdown starting with the living space and utilities.  The rental cost of a tiny room outside of a big city should be well under $1000 a month.  The meals, perhaps another 1800.  So where does the other $300 plus dollars a day go? 

I'm sure there is something I am missing.  I am also pretty sure regulations probably explain why it is so costly.

The system is glad to take any family assets that remain.

Near the end she got palliative / hospice type care.  It you gave up on living and did that, they would have a volunteer visit and offer a higher level of pain treatment."

2021-03-13 22:17:08,"It beggars belief that Gov Cuomo in NY is under more pressure for being a control freak creep (which was never news, although abuse should of course be investigated) than for caving to pressure from GNYHA (Greater New York Hospital Association) and LTCs to protect facilities from Covid liability. In NY the reason these places had such a high death rate was first due to greed and political power - not the fact they had to take infectious parents back from hospitals. Many if not most CNAs work at more than one facility in NYC. But PPE and proper infection control were NEVER the priority for staff or clients."
2021-03-13 22:19:40,"I’m sure I’m not the only NYT reader eager to hear how the care facilities with the least losses to covid managed to achieve that, and more about the indicators (besides race and location as the article depressingly points out) and management that made that possible."
2021-03-13 22:07:42,"Adding to all the difficulties noted in the article, changes in management at individual facilities can make dramatic differences in very short times, in either direction.  I know from personal experience.  No rating system for anything can account for that.  

It is almost impossible for an ordinary family to make a decision, no matter what Joan Lunden says.  

It seems to me having care homes owned by hedge funds is the absolutely dumbest way to run the system. When we add the pure profit motive to the lack of oversight; the priorities are truly out of whack."

2021-03-13 17:39:34,"I'm a retired occupational therapist. I immigrated to this country from Spain in 1994, with a job in a SNF (skilled nursing facility) often simply called a nursing home. SNFs are required to offer OT, PT and ST (speech therapy). At that time, almost 100% of the OTs and PTs were recruited (as was I) from overseas. This, presumably, because American trained therapists did not want to work in nursing homes, despite the fact that the pay is usually better than in an acute care hospital. 
I worked at about 6 different SNFs in TN, between 1994 and 2000 (the year I finally got my Green Card and was able to get a job in a hospital). Obviously, my experience was 20 years ago, and things may have changed, but I can tell you from my experience in the SNFs that they were all, without exception, very bad in many ways: patients left lying in urine or feces for hours; patients who needed the bathroom were told ""you're wearing a diaper, just go in your diaper""; uncaring and lazy CNAs (not all of them, obviously); not enough linens (try asking an old lady to wash herself with a bath towel because there are no wash cloths); wrong food (solid food for someone on a puréed diet); no thickener in the room (for someone on thickened liquids) etc. And the way in which the SNFs wanted to get therapists to do therapy for a whole hour on a person who was practically comatose and clearly not benefitting or able to participate, just so they could bill Medicare, was horrifying to me."
2021-03-13 22:25:15,"What?  False reports? Jiggered data? Understaffing? Absence of meaningful inspections? Poor safety? Incompetent medical regime? Neglect? Discrimination? Glowing or false narratives? Irrelevant evaluations? These have become normative in many industries including transportation, occupational safety, education,  health care, defense contracting, and on and on. There is little heart for even modest rigor and minimum competency.  And while we talk about pay incentives for the performance of executives, and returns for rich investors, we are paying less in minimum wages today than a quarter century ago (inadequate then) for the real work, 

The push for deregulation often hurts the most vulnerable, but advantages political, executive, and financial elites. Inflating the number of stars in ratings, gerrymandering voting districts, distorting or falsifying votes, rigging news stories, exaggerating the outcomes of medical trials - how are most people even capable of making judgments in the pervasive miasma of falsehood and distortion. What do we as individuals contribute to these systemic dishonesties?"
2021-03-13 22:21:53,"Way back in 2008-- in the middle of the housing catastrophe, Wall Street ""lobbied"" Congress and Barack Obama into  passing the 2008 Real Estate ReInvestment Act. 
This allowed many nursing homes to separate their operating companies from their asset and property companies in an effort to shield parent companies from liability and reduce regulatory oversight. They started buying up nursing homes and could not have cared less about the quality of care or patients--- and in fact they slashed staffing, cut costs, cut staff benefits and extracted all cash.

They created ""Real estate investment companies (REITs)"" which have dramatically expanded their ownership since the Housing and Economic Recovery Act  (2008) which precisely allowed REITs to buy health care facilities. 
These companies lease their facilities and property to ""nursing home operating companies"" at sometimes exorbitant rents-- which unleashed private equity firms to buy up nursing homes, hide the their profits in LLC's which would then contract out the ""care"" .
It's a shining example of predatory capitalism, lack of regulation, and 40 years of Reagan Revolution --- aided and abetted by corporate-supported/centrist  Democrats---on full display."
2021-03-13 22:26:26,"This is old news Nursing Homes have been gaming the system for decades 
and I might add very successfuly."
2021-03-13 22:33:26,"My wife had hip replacement a few years ago. We checked out a place in the North Bronx for rehab. When we went on the tour the person giving the tour said: we are very generous here, and allow you to keep $18,000, but sell your house. When I saw what they were charging to stay as a resident, I said to myself this place must be pretty good. The care my wife received there was abominable! The place was severely understaffed, and quality in care there was nonexistent. One day while waiting to enter to visit with my car I was asked to allow the Administrators through. I saw a procession of late model luxury cars, and suddenly understood where the money was going. After seeing a number of these places I was left feeling that I would rather have someone come up behind me and put one in the back of my head before I would go into one of those miserable facilities. From a young age we are taught to save our money for retirement. Now we find ourselves in a position where they will take it away in exchange for meager care. SMH"
2021-03-13 22:35:55,"I've seen enough first hand to conclude that we need to close all the nursing homes. Provide people care in their own homes, be they houses, apartments, or senior living communities. Let seniors and their family be in charge of hiring and firing licensed care givers, and yes, it needs to be covered by Medicare."
2021-03-13 22:38:48,"I would love to see this newspaper put outt an article on this subject every week until our lawmakers actually see fit to do something about it. This is epic and widespread malfeasance impacting (end sometimes ending) the lives of many, many people. It is an emergency, and we should all be treating it like one."
2021-03-13 22:40:59,"We can be fairly certain that these ""job-creating"" speculists (21 st Century corporations):

a) have their own lobby which works to make regulations ""more suitable""

b) work hard to get friends on any regulatory commissions

c) do their advertising best to game any unfavorable audits

d) charge more than it costs them to provide the service

e) encourage families and friends to be hands off (we've got this under control

The above are good business practices.  Perhaps we should be moving to a more cooperative, dare I say socialistic nursing home care."
2021-03-13 22:43:49,"Most nursing homes are just horrible places to be.  When we moved my mother down to as assisted living place close to us, they had recently been bought out by one of the large, well-known chains.  They were always understaffed, even though the women working there did seem to care.  I honestly don't know how anyone could stay in any of these places without a family member close by to check on them almost daily.  It's a ""business"" and they handle it exactly the way you would expect a ""business"" to handle it."
2021-03-13 22:45:08,"I had to put my mother in a nursing home many years ago and it gave me nightmares at what was at stake for her vulnerability. Even though we researched it from all the angles we were vigilant at being alert. It cost a small fortune. The staff were kept at a limited amount and most were devoted to their poorly paid job. As I’ve learned, it is all about big business and making a profit. The consumer and the employees are sacrificed for the profit at the top."
2021-03-13 22:47:13,"Thank you for this important story.  My mother died after a short stay in a five star rated nursing home in Georgia.  From the website, you'd think the place was an upscale resort, but inside the patients were heavily sedated to keep them quiet.  The worst part, however, was how long it took the nursing home to start doing the paperwork to get morphine on the last day of her life."
2021-03-13 22:48:58,"Congregant senior housing and nursing homes, whether private or non-profit, represent the perfect storm of what it means to be vulnerable and old in America. Staffed primarily by low wage healthcare aids, nursing assistants, and leveraged by greedy corporate interests is a shame upon our country.  Time for rigorous inspections and accountability!"
2021-03-13 22:49:11,"If the data is not checked and validated and if there are no official government inspections or government inspections that are serious and that not biased for the nursing home or inspections that are pre-announced  then what you end up with is potentially WORSE than knowing nothing -- because those that are the most dishonest and most powerful and most profitable with get the greatest boost in ratings.

And, what you have, in the end, is more LIES from the very same parties who are committed to supposedly telling you the truth and working for your welfare."
2021-03-13 22:53:03,"While this article makes several excellent points, the metric of minutes of nursing care per resident per day makes me suspect that some of the authors, like the general public, may not appreciate a core fact: most care at nursing homes is not delivered by nurses.

Instead, most direct care employees at nursing homes are nursing assistants, whose training and certification requirements vary widely from facility to facility and state to state. While most facilities hire certified nursing assistants (who have had basic direct care and safety training and passed a certification exam) some assisted living and home health companies hire “resident aides” or other meaningless terms—these are people with no standard training, hired off the street and trained in house.

Registered nurses, in nursing homes, handle medication administration for (often) dozens of patients, in addition to more complex tasks like wound care, health assessments and care coordination with other healthcare disciplines. In short, if your loved one is in a nursing home and puts on their call light, it is extremely unlikely that an RN will come to their assistance."
2021-03-13 22:54:00,"A 5-star home in MA has not had an update to it's data since 2019. They violate their patient's rights, deny and/or delay services, delay responses, ""lockdown"" patients when they have an offsite physician visit, provide supervision by making the patients stay in their rooms, not in the halls, disallow socializing between patients, even related patients and they count on family members not knowing the laws, rules and policies in licensing and accrediting organizations. It's a travesty. I can't verify the staffing numbers from the Medicare/Medicaid data, but it seems very high for what the residents themselves are reporting. Obviously, Medicare/Medicaid are too overwhelmed to follow through on detailed inspections. This leaves our loved ones imprisoned in facilities that do not care for them, or focus on doing the least for the many. There needs to be a better way to track care, no matter if it's a 1 Star or a 5 Star facility. The current excuse these facilities use is Covid, but I bet their care will not change once Covid is under control."
2021-03-13 22:55:33,"had looked at this rating system when considering placement for in law ..but we avoided... have now quit my job to take care of my parents....fortunately I get insurance through my husband and mortgage is paid, otherwise...this makes me glad I quit but sad this is the alternative. So many do not have that option  and for those extremely overworked and underpaid home healthcare staffers who helped before I quit, you are society's unsung heroes."
2021-03-13 22:57:26,"Thirty years ago, I was working on a report on the nursing home industry when a colleague said, “The nursing homes you want to be in rarely, if ever, have vacancies.” 

It is a terribly challenging profession, made more so by low wages, high stress, and both too few  and too many regulations.  It needs to be rethought with investment and operation for the public good."
2021-03-13 23:00:49,"There should be no star system. Period!  

All nursing homes must be run at the highest standards.  Period!

Anything less is wrong. 

There is a conflict of interest in allowing the privatization of Vital Industries. The health industry is the most glaring example, where the owner/insurer tries to collect as Much as Possible and deliver as Little as Possible. 

Until private industry is banned from controlling our healthcare industry this abominable situation will continue."
2021-03-13 23:03:52,"I worked at a SNF in 2014 as a nurse on the rehab floor. During my brief 6 month stint there, I was expected to manage the care for 18 people all of whom had multiple complicated diseases and conditions. My multiple duties included administering medications (some people had over 30 meds in an 8 hour period), provide wound care, analyze and report lab results, toilet and provide hygiene. Needless to say the task load was overwhelming and endless. It was not made easier by my administrative overlords. For example they were to cheap to hire a secretary. Every time a family member called, I had to stop what I was doing and try to track a resident down so they could talk to their loved one. This often took 10-15 minutes. There was only one server for several of the companies facilities. The internet was so slow, it often took several minutes for me to complete a simple charting task because I kept on getting kicked off the internet. One day the oxygen tanks did not arrive on time and residents on supplemental oxygen were unable to be showered. I charted this and was then told that I was not allowed to chart this because it made administration look bad. The dementia ward had 30 residents and was only staffed by one nurse. The list goes on and on. Thankfully I found another job. The only way that these places survive is that there is a small number of people who truly care about the elderly and work unpaid time to assure that things get done."
2021-03-13 23:05:43,"Nursing homes became an incredible scandal in the late 1960s after the new Medicaid and Medicare programs were enacted and created great financial incentives for investors, tax-exempt and taxable.

Politicians create welfare programs for seniors, the mentally ill and poor. They buy votes with new programs. But they don't win many votes with increased funding.

So these programs go unfunded and the patients suffer until the next scandal gets the politicians' attention. 

They've got to ""do something."" And they do with great fanfare and a lot of new benefits for providers, lawyers and lobbyists. Patients seldom benefit much from ""health care reforms"".

What to do?

1. Increase payments to nursing homes and make it profitable for taxable and tax-exempt organizations to staff up, clean up and provide quality care.

2. Pay states more to inspect, regulate and punish the bad actors. If inspectors are well paid, they'll be less likely to take bribes or be nice to their future employers, the nursing homes.

3. Shrink the number of people eligible for Medicaid and certain Medicare benefits so there is enough government money available to ensure quality care.

4. Sharply increase civil and criminal penalties for the bad actors.

5. Get J.D. Powers or some other credible agency (not the Joint Commission) to survey patients, their families and and other stakeholders to determine who is delivering quality care.

6. Make the owners and CEOs of big chains publicly accountable."
2021-03-13 23:10:13,"*** News flash: Inspections at hospitals are meaningless too. We also know when inspectors are coming and the entire staff get daily email reminders of the things the inspector will be looking for and the boxes they need to check.

Real evaluations need to look at real outcomes. Hospital admits, cause of death. You want to know staffing, look at payroll. Inspections have to be true surprises. Inspectors can't be subjected to production pressure for closing cases. And stop relying on facilities self reported information."
2021-03-13 23:14:52,"I have worked at a SNF for 8-9 years as a therapist and have always been shocked at how wonderful the facility runs when a ""surprise"" inspection occurs. Suddenly, there is hand sanitizer and wipes everywhere, call buttons are answered promptly, and meals improve. I am sad to say that it is not like that normally."
2021-03-13 23:15:25,"My praise to the NYT reporters (and researchers who shared their data) for this sobering and disturbing article. This is data-based reporting at its finest.  The  COVID pandemic has shed light on a form of vital care that receives too little attention from the public and from the government. I realize that nursing homes are difficult places to work in and thousands upon thousands of dedicated nurses, nursing aides and other therapists strive to provide high quality and loving care, but the system remains shrouded in mystery.  Last year, under the Trump Administration, CMS set up a special panel to make recommendations for improvement, but closed the meetings and filled it with industry representatives.  We need better oversight for a better system."
2021-03-13 23:16:43,"Nursing homes are where we warehouse our elderly so they can be out of sight and mind until they die. I would rather die 5 to 10 years earlier in my own home and spend a second of those five or 10 years in a nursing home. We have absolutely no respect for our elderly, no gratitude for the richness their lives brought to the world and abuse and neglect is rampant even in the most highly rated ones. If I ever get to the point where I need to give up my home and go to a nursing home, do me a favor and slip me something painlessly lethal and just let me go already."
2021-03-13 23:17:45,Thank you for this investigation! Its heart wrenching and stomach churning. My relative was in rehab at a 5 star facility prior to the pandemic. >$700 a day for a shared room was the rack rate. Staff were sick and coughing even then with no regard for the frailty of the residents. 1 month later 23 people there had died of Covid. But you would never know from they way the state tallied disease stats. Flu deaths in nursing have also been historically  lethal but under the radar. Software companies managing health data for insurance companies aid nursing homes in attaining 5 star ratings btw.
2021-03-13 23:19:14,Would have been nice for a report like this to have come out last year. Governors across the country are being called murderers for the deaths in nursing homes. A lot of us have known for years that a lot of these homes are a mess. I lost a family member to COVID in one last year because they were not keeping their residents safe. He got it from a nurse in the home. And I know of people who have gotten it from patients. A friend who did would come home from work almost in tears every day last year because of the conditions in the home she works in. I suspect COVID just made things even worse in a lot of them.
2021-03-13 23:22:29,"A big part of the blame is low Medicare reimbursement rates, Managed care companies that don’t pay in 120 days if at all, Medicaid that don’t pay, private patients that never pay, penalties and fines non stop.  You get what you pay for!"
2021-03-13 23:23:22,"Always all talk and no action. Who are the inspectors, where are they and how do I become one too. For all this long-winded articles does it might as well be fiction."
2021-03-13 23:28:41,"Interesting information, but how do I search for the facility my mother is currently in?"
2021-03-13 23:31:35,"Magnificent research and reporting.  I am a former journalist and I applaud the New York Times for the thoroughness, objectivity,  and wisdom put into creating this article. Bravo!"
2021-03-13 23:37:26,"The baby monitors which allow parents to see how their little ones are doing (and also how they are cared for by a babysitter) might also be useful in the room of an elderly resident to provide a basic check on how they are doing, and if and how they are being cared for. 
We now have body cameras for police, why not use cameras to protect our elderly? If the elderly person does not want to be on camera, they can simply turn it off, and the nursing home need not be any the wiser."
2021-03-13 23:53:24,"This article is much the same as the last NYT’s investigative  article re nursing homes.  The comments are similar too.
I am an RN (now retired) who worked for 40 years mostly in hospitals ( where you can make a decent living wage), but also in hospice and LTC facilities.
Everything said here is true of course. Although what part of the country you live in also determines QoC.
The one thing that is not being discussed is that modern medicine has made it possible to live far beyond our years of usefulness and productivity - prerequisites for most people to feel that life still has meaning and purpose .  If I had a dollar for every elderly patient who told me “I am ready to die now” I would be a rich woman.
Until rich countries start facing the question of letting people die with dignity, which requires withholding treatment and making euthanasia possible - on a voluntary basis, we will not be able to give people the choices they need to control the last years of their lives.
Everyone who has a relative in, or visits a nursing home, has to ask themselves if this is the way THEY want to exist in their last years or months."
2021-03-13 23:53:47,I appreciate that this article mentioned a solution to the problem- more staff per resident.  In NY there is no mandatory staffing ratio in nursing homes. These for-profit companies make the staff do more with less. It’s not right. It would also help if the staff was paid for their hard work. I briefly worked at a nursing home and made just over minimum wage.
2021-03-13 23:57:24,"Having lived in a SNF for 4 yrs I can say it is run by and for the equity firms.  I was in a privately owned facility that unbeknownst to me was for sale and in hindsight I see the financial, quality control and service reductions made to cheat the new investors!  Having cooked the books and gamed the California state inspectors, the new owners forced the manager, with a Masters degree in Healthcare Administration, to cut staff, care and services to meet the false financial profits that were expected.  The problems are the administration MHA is not licensed by the state as a Healthcare worker who can have his license lifted and is only answerable to the investors, the state ombudsman is overworked, the state inspectors are being gamed eg administration preselects files to be reviewed, patients to be intervand 'spot' inspections are preannounced between SNF administrators because the inspectors check into a local motel and do an entire district area and the first one telephones his local peers with a warning as much as 30 in advance.  How do I know?  Staff gets called to inspection prep meetings, call button are no longer hidden by demonstrably repeatedly put in plain access, food is dramatically improved, walls are painted, facets, showers and toilets fixed, grounds groomed and flowers planted, increase in staff hours, polished floors.  When the inspection is over - grilled cheese sandwiches for dinner, flowers not watered, staff hour reduction to recover prior expendatures,"
2021-03-14 00:02:00,"Don't ever trust an institution's self report or the way it appears on its website or even in person tours. A lobby with a hotel feel is not necessarily conducive to good quality of care and adequate staffing. Seek out the facilities that are not-for-profit. Always check the state's survey results (surveys are done annually) to see where the facility might have deficiencies and if there have been ""stop placements"" due to dangerous situations. Facilities also have a timeline in which to make the improvements or else face more serious consequences. I would also advise (and of course this has not been possible during time of COVID) frequent visits by family and friends and involvement in the loved one's care - as well as calling the state ombudsperson hotline if there are concerns of neglect and/or abuse."
2021-03-14 00:04:20,"As a former senior executive for private and public long term care (nursing home) companies in the 80's and 90's and an administrator and regional director before then, we revolutionized quality of care and peer review standards. We literally took run down and poorly operated properties and renovated and staffed them with highly educated and experienced staff and management. Our standards led the way back then to a long term care and rehabilitation facility revolution. The properties were renovated from the roof down to the landscape and everything in between; we remodeled the interiors, added new call systems and safety devices. Our facilities which we acquired and had been places where state investigators even hated to inspect were turned into bright, lively, active communities where residents were offered menu dining, full range of daily activities, community outings, pets and children visits, and cleanliness, respect, strict adherence and beyond any and all regulations yet were profitable and fully occupied. I took great pride as did my management team in inviting families, community leaders, and even celebrities to visit and tell us what we could do better.
Then our boards of director became greedy and those of us who spent 15 + years operating these beautiful properties refused to give them any more profit if it were at the expense of quality and we all resigned and went elsewhere. Some of us became startup and investor operators, others start their own."
2021-03-14 00:11:24,"The Long-Term Care Ombudsman Program was formed to help states establish an investigative unit which would respond to complaints in long-term care facilities.
1972.
No mention in the piece.
Must not be doing their job. . .I guess.
The Missouri LTC Ombudsman was helpful to our family.
Many seniors have no one.
Many seniors have families that would rather ignore them."
2021-03-14 00:21:07,"There is a reason why we have long referred to the ""nursing home industry.""  Old and frail adults are treated as commodities, like cattle, and chickens. In the case of nursing homes, corporations are bent on squeezing every last Medicare and Medicaid tax dollars into profits for shareholders. This requires exploiting both direct care staff and residents.
For many years, I worked with nursing homes, both in investigating complaints and in programs for staff training.  The bottom line is accountability, as the New York Times, has so clearly demonstrated in this heartbreaking expose.
Most corporations will only do the right thing when it costs more to not do so."
2021-03-14 00:21:55,"My father was in the nursing home assisted living  system for 10 years. If we were not there to be his constant advocates, he would have died an early death. Multiple unexplained falls, constant pressure for permission to medicate. We tried the for profits and the non profits. In the end the not for profits with well paid staff were the best facility. For the last years of his life, we were fortunate that he lived in a vermont veterans old age home where he received excellent compassionate care. Staff was well paid and had job security. That was the key. For profit care for seniors is a failure!"
2021-03-14 00:22:51,"Never do I see the term “retirement community” in this article. An elderly friend went into a VERY expensive retirement home. Cocktails on Fridays. Movies on Wednesday nights and Saturday nights. It was lovely. 

Then she fell ill from a fall and went into the “medical” (nursing home) wing/building. The care was atrocious. Her sister (87) felt that it was so poorly managed it must surely be a different state agency that overseas it. 

End of life care is a challenge now, and will be a challenge for those of us reading this article!

Thank you NyT for this expose. Thank you."
2021-03-14 00:25:09,"I am SO grateful for this reporting.  I am just one of three daughters who worked tirelessly to manage my Mon's situation at Our Lady of Mercy, Guilderland, NY.  We used all of the tools in the world to help get my Mom the right level of care at this ""gold star, private, Catholic"" nursing home; who charged $20K per month.  Meetings with staff, contacting St. Peter's Hospital Corp. who owns them.  One sister visited twice a day daily, the other every weekend from Westchester.  I managed spreadsheets of complaints/concerns; etc. set up meeting with the Head of Nursing (twice monthly).  Yet nothing changed, things continued to get worse!  Pictures of my Mom who was dropped and resulted in a Hospital stay still haunt me.  Things that were discovered about her health while in Hospital ""that should have NEVER been missed"" almost cost her her life and keep me away six years later.  SHe is now gone and I only hope that she knows and forgives us that we did all we could, extraordinarily, and still we failed her.  God forgive me."
2021-03-14 00:26:05,"There’s no substitute for being at home with family & assisted by outside care. Unfortunately, the geographic size of the US, our mobility & family breakdowns forbid this in many cases. My dad was in a high-end community that included a nursing facility. When he needed to move into the nursing home, the #1 question was: do you have a DNR?  If not, why not?  Says it all."
2021-03-14 00:28:36,"My grandmother died in a nursing home because of negligence.  Her son was a Judge high up in the Utah court system and refused to either hold them accountable or to prosecute for fear of reprisals, as is the Utah way.  Many more cover ups occurred but the extended family was unsuccessful.


This is mot just about Covid but America’s throw away culture when it comes to our elderly.  That is the real story here and I hope the NYT’s stays on this."
2021-03-14 00:29:40,"Thank you for this valuable reporting. I promised myself I would write to NY State authorities in 2004 when my Mother in Law landed in a facility (Woodmere Rehab?) on Franklin Ave.in Woodmere, NY. The lack of staff and lack of care were horrifying. My mother in law spent hours abandoned. I never wrote the letter.

I note the facility has a new name. Hopefully that means improvements were made but your article indicates this remains a shameful stain on how we treat our senior citizens. Especially those of color."
2021-03-14 00:30:38,"The stories are appalling. 
We need to find a way to ensure these facilities are properly managed and staffed and the residents kept well, safe and cared for."
2021-03-14 00:34:55,"Until American society starts to better value the elderly and demand the needed resources to care for the frail elderly and disabled - this same thing will continue.  Our medical system is focused on curing diseases - not caring for the frail and elderly who will not improve according to various ""rating scales.""    
The current five star system is designed to rate only what CMS wants rated and treated not what the person actually needs. Facilities admit patients based on how the person's needs met the CMS payments guidelines.  ( MDS data  in nursing homes or OASIS  data in home health). he facility will be paid a high rate for patient A and a low rate for patient B- based on these scores. Dementia is not usually considered with these ratings.  - although it causes many problems. 

I have worked in this industry for 26 years - non-profit,  private and government facilities.  All facilities can pick what patients  they admit. This is unlike an acute care hospital who has to stabilize all patients who come to the ER. The more ethical government facilities did admit almost every persons referred for care. Care was focused on patient needs and how to meet the needs. About the time of the 2009 recession, even the non-profit, government facilities started to focus more on revenue producing patients."

2021-03-14 00:43:56,"Pardon me, please, if I'm bursting your bubble that believes that non-profits are essentially free of greed.  Many simply drain off huge sums in salaries and benefits for the people who run the organization. And non-profits usually avoid taxes that others pay.  

The bottom line is no profit or benefits for anyone--except those in charge. Residents may still be regarded only as a source of income and treated as such. This is not true of all non-profits. But the notion that non-profits will always take better care of their residents is false."
2021-03-14 00:45:28,"Even in the country with the worst overall healthcare scores in the developed world, this is appalling. But this is just one large problem in a world of problems. The key word in this article is ""industry,"" a word used interchangeably with ""market,"" another overused term in the executive suites of healthcare institutions. When healthcare changed from a mission to a market, everything changed along with it; including our assumptions about what health care should be, how it should be delivered and how much the financial element should be regulated. In Oregon, utilities are regulated. Much of the financial oversight is under the purview of the state. When the electric company wants a raise, it has to apply for approval and to demonstrate a reason. It's certainly not a perfect system, but it's way ahead of healthcare. The American people in should look to the Nordic countries for a model of how to deliver quality care at a reasonable cost. A good place to start would be to question the assumption that healthcare should be a for-profit undertaking."

Every time I went to see her, she had strange bruises. She would follow me to the elevator begging me to take her home, crying. It was gut wrenching. As the months went by, her mind started to fail and she talked often of physical abuse. We thought it was dementia. After she died, we found out another patient had been fed intravenously with little more than water before she passed. 

I reported the home to the state and covered the story locally. I see little has changed and those visits with her haunt me still. So naive and trusting we were."

It was about 8 months of the worst period of her life -- and she was in what is still considered the ""gold standard"" of nursing homes, if there is such a thing.  She went in at the age of 84, completely ambulatory, walked on her own (had early dementia, but fed herself, walked, and enjoyed reading -- and still did the NYT puzzle.  When I kidnapped her, she'd been wheel-chaired because it was easier for the staff to push her around, rather than accompany her on foot.  As a result, she experienced atrophied muscles and even though I visited (only once a week as I myself was recuperating from surgery and could not walk) it wasn't enough.  I hired a day nurse for her, but that wasn't enough either.  

Additionally, when they dressed her, they used talcum powder which fell on the floor, and as you may or may not know, on uncarpeted floors, it's a lubricant.  She fell the first week she was there, having slipped on it, and needed to visit the hospital for the abrasions on her face. 

Nursing homes.  Should all be closed.  Keep your loved ones home with you.  I got her home as soon as I was recuperated.  She never walked again, but was able, at least to rise up out of the chair and transport herself to the toilet with assistance.  I tore my heart out."

2021-03-14 01:17:20,"My parents were both in a nursing home in NJ.
They both contracted MRSA and the Nursing home covered that up.  It was not mentioned on the death certificates. My mother had severe bed sores. Many staff at the nursing home did not provide “care” for the patients.  What I mean by this is that most of those that attended to the patients did not care.
If a patient did not eat or complained, they didn’t encourage them.  Perhaps there wasn’t enough staff.
When my mother passed away, I received a phone call from the hospital administrator who said: “You are not going to cause trouble are you?

Governor Cuomo should not be blamed for the high death rates in the Nursing homes. They are enclosed environments and disease rapidly spreads.
I really think Cuomo worked tirelessly over many consecutive  days.  He really did care.  Quite different than our former president."

We spent months at a time in lockdown for norovirus outbreaks. We were constantly understaffed, with frequent turnover among nurses and poorly paid, overworked CNAs. I witnessed and my patients told about truly horrible living conditions. I reported abuse to the Ombudsman on multiple occasions, including patients being slapped by staff and being punished for using the call light too frequently by having the heat in the room turned off. Meanwhile, staff knew about upcoming inspections and the facility ""staffed up"" and provided extra trainings in advance, then received the best rating. I left that job as soon as I could. Last I checked dozens of residents in the SNF have died of Covid-19."
2021-03-14 01:31:14,"My father died this summer in a nursing home ravaged by Covid. While his nursing home wasn't the worst compared to some I've seen, there were still problems:

There is ZERO accurate public information on how many patients currently reside in that nursing home. Published info says there are 350 ""beds,"" but I only counted about 150 patients on a patient roster I got my hands on, and I know that dozens of rooms were empty. When we were doing the placement, we were told that there was a ""waiting list"" but this turned out to be completely false. 

My father also received endless assessments billed to Medicare. I'd see a doctor pop by his room, check some boxes on a list and pop out. Every month assessment after assessment billed to Medicare. Fall assessments, physical therapy assessments. (He was bedridden.) I never saw anyone actually evaluate him for any period of time.

My father's nursing home cost $14,000 a month. When he eventually went on Medicaid he paid less. I was told the amount reimbursed to the nursing home by Medicaid was about $5,500 per month, and there was no change in the quality of his care from private-pay patient to Medicaid patient. In reality, those who pay the full cost are providing the profit but not receiving better care. 

By the way, this was a non-profit nursing home. As I say, it was far from the worst and I'm thankful for that, but this industry really needs an overhaul."

You cannot imagine a more disgusting and frustrating job than being a CNA as my brother very well knows. It is making him an excellent doctor, but I pity the people that do that for their whole lives. When you pay exorbitant amounts to live in a nursing home, that money isn’t going to the employees doing hands on work, it’s lining pockets of the filthy people at the top.

The covid pandemic is worse in some nursing’s homes than others, and that’s because of both a lack of state health dept advice but also ineptitude (for decades) by nursing home administrators to improve their business because the public honestly doesn’t care that much and they often don’t have the option to.

To this day, I can hear her screaming in pain begging Hearthstone’s “team” to call a doctor.  Yes, she was hospitalized, and a few days later, rather than allow her to return from hospital to a familiar place with end of life hospice care, Heathstone, together Amy Stern, then director of United Hospice of Rockland, just said "" we will not allow her to return” engineering my mother’s unfortunate  end of life in a totally unfamiliar place.  Not a good story then and it would be a worse story in the age of Covid.

2021-03-14 01:34:04,"It’s not only that the 5-Star Quality Rating system conceals abuse. CMS doesn’t even track “abuse perpetrator type” in nursing homes nationwide. That is, CMS doesn’t require 50 State Survey Agencies to track whether it was a care employee abusing a resident vs. whether it was a resident-to-resident incident. 

Resident-to-resident incidents can result in injuries and deaths as Shinoda-Tagawa et al. reported in their study in JAMA in 2004 and as I reported in my study on 105 fatal resident-to-resident incidents (Journal of Elder Abuse & Neglect).

This major gap in oversight was reported in a 2019 GAO investigation report: Nursing Homes: Improved Oversight Needed to Better Protect Residents from Abuse (June 13, 2019).

I’ve identified this gap a couple of years earlier in my article in the above journal.

Caspi, E. (2017). A federal survey deficiency citation is needed for resident-to-resident aggression in U.S. nursing homes.

The Times article reported on a fatal resident-to-resident strangulation in a nursing home in Florida. Yet another tragic death that won’t be tracked.

If you don’t track this phenomenon, it doesn’t exist. If it doesn’t exist, you don’t have to learn from it to prevent future incidents. 

It’s a Pandora Box CMS must open.

It has been over 18 months since GAO  “priority” recommendation to track “abuse perpetrator type” was made and despite HHS concurring with it, it is still not implemented.

I call it “Nested Neglect.”

So in most cases, someone in the family could manage to care for the sick person for a few months. Now, due to advances in medical science, people may require constant care but they can live many years after a terminal diagnosis. Our social, economic and medical systems are not able to cope with this situation. But on the other hand, our ""moral"" values will not allow people to choose to live at their own homes if that's what they want to do. Nor can they choose to end their lives, either. Catch 22 all around if you ask me."
2021-03-14 02:06:19,"I have 25 years experience as a medical advocate for elderly people.  This study is consistent with my experience in all healthcare institutions: nursing homes, rehabs, and hospitals. 

These are very difficult organizations to manage even with ample resources.  And there has been increasing federal pressure from to squeeze their budgets as all stakeholders in the healthcare system, including investors, vie for a bigger share of the national healthcare pie. Yet our national healthcare expenditures continue to increase as they have for 40 years, without improving the health outcomes of Americans compared to other countries, who spend much less per capita. 

The new systems to incentivize and control the quality of medical care in all our medical institutions are just band aids compared to the complexities and depth of the problems, including the culture of lying throughout.  

A nursing student recently told me that she was taught that lying on medical records to cover up problems was the ethical thing to do as hospitals were community organization which were more valuable than any patient. I recall that Sissela Bok in her seminal book on Lying states that medical students are taught to lie to patients, though what patients want is to be told the truth.

My advice is to stay out of these institutions, and rely on outpatient and home care as nuch as possible."

This allows for many people who need assistance to be able to live in the community rather than nursing homes. This model has existed in the US since the 1970s.  These programs are only in 31 states reaching  55,000 people yearly. Only 4% of the PACE population ends up living in a nursing home yet all are eligible. 
There have been studies that show the outcomes are much better (lower hospitalizations, lower Emergency visits, lower fall rates, lower pressure ulcer and less social isolation. 
There have been 1/3 less deaths and hospitalizations in this group of older adults compared to nursing home groups
Preliminary reports from the Altarum Policy group indicate that PACE, the Program for All-Inclusive Care for the Elderly, responded swiftly to the Covid-19 pandemic to keep its participants safe and well cared for—without leaving them lonely or isolated. 
Please let your community know about PACE and if you do not have it available in your community or state, please ask your state officials why not? All of us should have the right to live in the community in our later years with a nursing home being the last resort when no other options exist."
2021-03-14 02:20:47,"This is what happens when health care is privatized and made into a profit making machine rather than getting actual health care. I'm a licensed social worker who has worked in two different nursing homes - one had just been taken by National Healthcare (NHC), the one mentioned in the article. What ensued after that was a purging of the staff, including me, eventually, because they wouldn't. for some reason, fire the social worker who took my place. She had been demoted once when they took over from a nursing home administrator to just the assisted living portion of the facility, and demoted again into my spot. Perhaps it was because she had been with the previous, family-owned facilities (the family owned three - one in another town and one in my city), I'll never really know.

They second nursing home had a really sketchy reputation, but I needed a job. Three weeks later, I literally packed my stuff and turned in my resignation letter. The state had come in the night before to do a pop inspection and let's juts say that it didn't go well.

Her assisted-living residence, Lester Senior Housing, in Whippany, NJ, was beyond 5 stars. I'd give it 10 - that's how immaculate and well-run it was. Families were not allowed any indoor visits, only outdoors. All visiting nurses had their temperatures taken before entering. So how did my mother die? Where did her system fail her? She contracted it from her visiting aid, who confided to my mother that she was feeling some symptoms that day - runny nose, slight fever - yet knowingly proceeded to visit her anyway. The aid made it through security because oft times familiarity breeds lethargy: Security may or may not have been at their desk at the time. If they were, why go through the motions when you already know someone? My mother and her aid were together without wearing masks - and therein lies the second failure: The Jewish organization working in conjunction with Lester, subcontracting out to a 3rd party agency whose candidates hadn't been thoroughly vetted. My mother complained to her best friend during several phone calls prior to any diagnosis, about the aid's nonchalance in visiting her when not feeling up to par. Two days after her visit, the aid tested positive for Covid-19. Three days later, so did my mother. A week after that, my mother was gone.

I discovered many horrors in her facilities (and removed her) and others when I toured NY and Florida. State run facilities were horror shows (back in 2007 when she was no longer able to care for herself). For example, when walking into a facility, I learned that the smell of popcorn in the lobby was intended to hide the smell of urine).

2021-03-14 03:51:34,"Bravo for exposing the dirty little lie that nursing homes and rehabs are safe. I cared for my mom until she passed at 99, and three rehabs she was in were ticking time bombs i.e. no doctors on site, incorrect medication doses, theft and more. Rife for investigation next is the home health aide business. The aides my mom had, except for 4 out of 30, were untrained in positioning, denture care, and were scary rude. They pretended they couldn’t cook, had ear buds in listening to music or on cell phones, slept on the night shift while my mother, who was blind, stumbled around looking for the bathroom. They destroyed our furniture, spilled food on the carpeting, broke the AC, stole jewelry, steak knives and rice. The agency’s insurance carrier did a bogus investigation and didn’t pay our claim, My mom was hospitalized after an aide left her the bathroom and she fell and cracked her head.Why did we stay with them? Because there was no other agency that could provide coverage 24/7. The home health aide business needs reform and more regulation, more stringent  licensing requirements for each aide. I never knew the real, full, names of the aides sent into our home, “Kelly,” I discovered, was really Lakisha. The agencies must be required to provide clients with a copy of the aides license or similar ID just as any employer would be entitled to see. We’re a graying population. Now is the time to reform the home health aide business:
more regulation and more stringent qualifications."
2021-03-14 03:59:31,"Insufficient staffing leads to killer bed sores-I have seen many in my years of nursing, but one was so bad, down to the bone, and this person died of sepsis. No idea why it got to that point, and I wonder if this person was moved from facility to facility to avoid scrutiny.
Aside from the Covid 19 deaths, and no family allowed to visit all this time, those who fare best are patients with family members visiting frequently. It puts managers on alert. 
It's been mentioned before, but low pay draws the wrong kind of workers. I may not believe in the minimum wage of $15 across the board, but it's not enough pay for the good workers who do their best job caring for the elderly.
AARP has written much about the nursing home inadequacies, and the best suggestion I've seen is to regulate all of them (sorry, but some NFP homes stink, too) like utility companies. Nobody, and I mean nobody, goes into nursing home ownership to help the elderly. The business was created to spawn its abuse; it's a federally sponsored entitlement system that rewards those who can figure out how to game the system to their financial advantage. Even some NFP homes have management who learn to pocket $ meant to improve care.
The bribes not uncovered are the source of unsurprising ""surprise"" inspections; been going on for 50 years or more. How naive are we to think this isn't systemic."
2021-03-13 17:21:41,"A good friend of mine and fellow nurse worked in a nursing home briefly after graduating from nursing school. Her patient to nurse assignment ratio was 22 to one. She quit after only two weeks on the job because she felt the environment was unsafe. Even for an experienced nurse, I don’t know how you provide excellent care for 22 individuals without cutting corners."
2021-03-14 02:01:19,"Dear New York Times, 

Please continue to report on all these abuses. Someone must educate Americans and get us all, to face the truth! Nothing will change unless WE demand and expect better!"
2021-03-13 23:36:25,"We are idealistic when speaking of nursing homes.  For starters the elderly are abandoned there.   Yes some use it as rehab and then discharged back home, but for the most part they are abandoned.  Unless you want to sign up for work cleaning feces and urine and other fluids, you cannot criticize workers.  You leave family members there to die because you chose not to make the sacrifice to care for them."
2021-03-14 01:08:21,Shocking and frightening.  Can NYT tell us how this problem is managed in countries that do it well?
2021-03-13 17:45:40,"My mother died at a nursing home last year, before the Covid outbreak.

We did a lot of research to find the best facility, close to all her children.

It was highly-rated, and it cost a beautiful dollar to buy into CCRC and pay the monthly fee, as well.

And it turned out to be a filthy horror show, not for lack of dedicated staff, but because resources weren’t forthcoming by the owners.

My siblings and I visited constantly to be sure she got proper care. I said, “Can you imagine the patients who don’t have family nearby? They are really at their mercy.”"
2021-03-13 17:22:53,"Nursing Homes and assisted living facilities in this country are a travesty. For the most part they are run by for-profit corporations mainly concerned with profit not quality care. They pay staff poorly, train poorly, have exceedingly high turnover rates. The facility my mother was in consistently recieved high state rankings. However her care was abominable and when looking for other facilities, the same complaints were found.  For example, often doctor orders were overlooked or lost, strange doctors given access to her care without consent, medications and tests missed, cleanliness a continual problem, hearing aids often broken,etc, etc. Elder care in this country is basically criminal and horrendously expensive. There is medicaid, but in the facility mentioned above, four elderly medicaid folks shared one small bathroom, had small rooms and had to have roommates. And  I can't imagine the low quality of their care.  We desperately need a national health care system that pays for respectful, high quality living conditions for our loved elderly people whether in a facility or home."
2021-03-14 03:06:05,"It's called lobbying and the nursing home industry has spent a lot of money in DC and in the various states. They get meaningless fines and are always cutting costs and personnel. They also separate the facilities, the real estate and the operations so they are hard to sue. Unless the laws get some teeth in them it will continue to go on as ever. The corporate owners are virtually torturing the patients to death as they bleed them of their assets."
2021-03-14 03:52:13,"This is sick, I’m so glad I moved out of the US to an actual developed nation where old people are treated with the respect and dignity that any human being deserves. 
Why there are no criminal charges filed against any of these homes? The owners should be facing not only corruption and criminal charges but also jail time."
2021-03-14 03:08:17,"My mother, a spry 94-year-old Holocaust survivor from Russia, died in December from Covid-19. Her assisted-living residence in NJ was beyond reproach. I'd give it 10 stars: Immaculate. Well run. Great facilities. No family visits except outdoors. All staff's temperatures taken before entry. So how could my mother have died? By contracting it from her visiting aide, who had confided to my mother of feeling symptoms that day - runny nose, slight fever - yet knowingly proceeded to visit her anyway. The aide made it through security due to lethargy mixed with familiarity: Why go through the motions checking someone when you already know them? My mother and her aide spent their time together without wearing masks - and therein lies the second failure: subcontracting out to a 3rd party agency whose candidates hadn't been thoroughly vetted. My mother complained to her best friend during several phone calls prior to any diagnosis, about the aide's indifference to not feeling up to par. Two days after her visit, the aide tested positive for Covid-19. Three days later, so did my mother. A week after that, my mother was gone. Yet the aide survived and continues to work, as does the aide personnel agency that failed everyone."
2021-03-14 03:14:49,"And this is news to whom?

It's about time the Media started looking at the real criminals in this nasty business with the Nursing Homes.

All that talk about who to blame for the deaths of seniors in those ""rat traps"" just so we would look the other way.

Hope they will be doing a detailed investigation on all the money that was paid out in campaign donations,  to you know who, by all those hedge fund and equity capital investors to ""deregulated"" the Nursing House Industry just so a bunch of criminals could make a buck while they treated our seniors like trash.

It's about time the Media got down to the real story in this criminal activity."
2021-03-13 18:03:41,I worked in health care for years and friends will ask for a recommendation for a place for their parents.   My primary criteria is always “nonprofit” as there is no room for a profit motive AND high quality care of residents.  My second criteria is that is be unionized so there are eyes watching at all times.
2021-03-14 02:48:39,"""Private equity firms were buying many nursing homes..."" 

Wall Street is a huge parasite, squeezing the last drops of profit from our elderly before they die. I've worked in so many of these places and its just disgusting."
2021-03-14 01:15:31,"Ask the low wage staff who work in these places! They’ll tell you a better metric that predicts the quality of care in these places!! Its such a good metric, thats why they avoid using it! Cause it’s accurate!! It will show most of them to be poor!! 
Just ask the staff: 
-how much are you paid? 
-is it enough for you to live on?
-do you work anywhere else apart from this job? 
These questions will tell you whether it’s a good home or not!! 
I’ve worked in the care industry, I’ve cleaned and bathed people etc etc!
The way the staff are treated and compensated reflects the quality of care!!!! 
You get what you pay for!!  
Governments need to ask how much these owners of these places pay their staff. These owners take most of the profit and don’t pay their staff well! 
And then they claim Medicare or government reimbursement rates are low!!!! That’s what they claim at places I’ve worked!! Yet the owner is apparently flying in a private plane!! 
Governments know this, they know how poorly those workers are paid! Those business owners fund these politicians! So they know exactly what’s going on and why the care is poor: poorly compensated staff!! Those rich owners of these places are exploiting the staff and taking most of the profit for themselves!! 
We need to ask how well the staff are being paid, among other questions!! Otherwise, the care industry will continue to be like this!!"
2021-03-13 19:04:17,"Pulling the heartstrings in this article a little. Let’s not forget about protecting shareholder value.

Investors put money into these facilities and they have an obligation to maintain profitability. Adding more regulations and staff will prevent a maximum return on investment.

Nursing homes are a business not a charity."
2021-03-13 17:25:00,"Thank you.  I believe the problems in nursing homes exposed by the covid virus have been under- reported.  My experience with elder care in general- from home care to assisted living to nursing home has been depressing.  At worst it was awful and at best barely adequate.  Most problems stem from staff shortages, staff turn over and low pay. Because my siblings and I could visit our parents frequently we were able to keep an eye on any irregularities. God help anyone who gets into one of these systems without an advocate on the outside."
2021-03-14 04:26:46,"If you have a loved one in a nursing home, you simply have to visit frequently and closely monitor your loved one's care.  Ask lots of questions, and if you don't get a satisfactory answer, keep going up the food chain.  At least they'll know your family member has someone who is paying attention and advocating for their care. Be friendly, but persistent.  It will be a lot harder if your person has dementia or some other condition that prevents your loved one from speaking to you about their care and about incidents that may have happened. Be vigilant.  You will have to personally fill in a lot of the gaps in care.  Watch the medication closely.  It's not just over-administration of drugs that aren't called for, sometimes staff don't administer the medications that are prescribed and truly needed.  And be appreciative of the many very hard-working and kind aides and other staff you will encounter.  Their jobs are low-paid and very difficult."
2021-03-14 04:30:53,"I have yet to be to a nursing home I would want to stay in for 1 day much less till I die.  You need to have a private nurse to help with care on top of the money spent.  The care is awful and not because of the people working there, but because of the lack of staff needed.  I had a family member  that I needed to move out after 2 days.  I wasn't able to stay the smell would give me migraines.
There needs to be an oversite and I would start by talking to the people in there and then their  family members."
2021-03-14 04:37:38,"Excellent and very sobering article. With the demographics in this country the profit motive will grow and the care will likely decline further unless the federal government gets in with strong regulations, which I would support. At 76 and in good health, I am still terrified that I will end up in one of these facilities someday.

Business decries regulation, but thanks to the excellent work of the New York Times, we can certainly make a case that it is sorely needed in this industry. Who thinks it is ethical to list administrators as those who care for patients? Who thinks it is the least bit humane to let an elderly, helpless person lie in his or her own waste? Go hours or days without medical attention?  

I hope that the New York Times will follow up with highly specific recommendations for health industry should be regulated."
2021-03-14 04:42:56,"The larger operators have learned to game the system. This is the secret playbook. 

Nursing homes are highly regulated by the government as elder abuse is easy. If you go to a restaurant and order a 12 oz steak and get a 6 oz steak, you’ll send it back. An 80 year old doesn’t do that. In fact, you can give him a frank and he won’t create problems. To fight this, the government wisely put controls in that distributions to owners are strictly limited so that the money paid stays in the home to service the residents. 

But they left a gaping hole. Nursing homes are not prevented from hiring related companies to service the homes. So the operators open a related company, as 40 percent on to the bill and make a fortune. In fact, the money siphoned out through related entities is far more then the profit of running the home. Practically every large vendor is related. The pharmacy, (it’s child’s play to add 40-70 percent up charge on prescriptions) staffing services, all medical goods from wheelchairs to bedpans. Sheets, linen cleaning, all laundry, landscaping etc. Because if this, there’s little money left in the home to care for the elderly. The government is giving enough, it’s just siphoned off 

A simple directive from health department making it a crime to use any related parties would solve 75 percent of the problems."
2021-03-14 04:45:08,"If the New York Times can investigate these nursing homes accurately, why can’t state and federal regulators? The obvious answer is that regulators are either understaffed and underfunded or complicit, or both. This summer will mark the 10th anniversary of my father’s death in a state-run veteran center. He had been mentally and physically able to stay in his own home until he was 95, but then a fall meant that he needed care. We found a place in a nearby veterans center that had a very good reputation, but almost immediately I could tell that he was a different person from the one I had known. He and the other residents were docile, almost catatonic, and I suspected that the residents were given meds to make them more compliant. He died one year after admission. Since that time, I have learned that the center did not fare well in the past year, with several dozen COVID-related deaths. 

I’d like to say that private for-profit firms be banned from this sector, but my experience with this state-run entity suggests that by itself that will not improve care. End-of-life care is enormously expensive, and to do it right demands much higher staff-patient ratios. We have a long-term care policy, but it has limitations on how many years of care can be covered. At this point, I hope I die in my sleep before having to draw on the policy."
2021-03-14 04:57:16,We reward least those to whom we entrust the care of our most vulnerable - the very young and the very old. And we are surprised at poor outcomes.
2021-03-14 05:02:35,"New York Times provided part of the solution. Daily staffing  from pay roll should be available to the public to compare.  Staffing report should list salaried vs hourly, full time vs part time, agency vs own staff. Staff hourly rate at every dollar or five dollar category should separate out the administrative staff just from payroll data.  Hospital side list of admissions by category.  The number of reports to police and state authorities. Staff turnover ratios, CNA vs LPN vs RN.   There is a lot of data if they really wanted to give you full picture."
2021-03-14 05:18:17,"Fair warning, do not be fooled by the winsome facility names or the activity calendars. These places are not going to meet your expectations. The financial structure is all wrong. My father suffered through two nursing homes in the last two years of his dementia. I did extensive research into these star rating inspection reports, I visited facilities. In the end I picked the one closest to my house so that I could visit a lot. The sad truth was that if you don’t have upwards of $10k/month (in Kansas City!) you are at the mercy of this archaic broken system that has been bypassed by modern practices in all ways. I visited, I advocated, I tried everything. It was a horrible experience for my dear dad and all of us. Google my TED talk if you want to hear our family’s story."
2021-03-14 05:40:12,"The microbiome of the elderly is weakened with age and a large number of insults imposed by man. List on request. It's long. Damien Carrington of The Guardian has reported extensively. The Guardian is free. We are in our 80s. A leading illness for the elderly in homes is UTI, or urinary tract infection. Fecal matter finds its way. Antibiotic by mouth is used; it makes matters worse, risking the gut microbiome or the patient's immune system, opening the door for H. Pylori and C. Difficile - and, yes, COVID-19.. Any weakening of the gut microbe that defend us opens the door for bacterial or viral illness. Parenteral is rarely found on charts. Oral only is rarer. However, subcutaneous works well. By needle. And you do not need much. Subcutaneous works in tandem with the healthy microbiome we all have - or we would die. Our immune system is the gate keeper. Swallowing lands on the mtDNA impregnated microbiome that comprise our immunity. These little guys can die off with antibiotics drenching the area. Livestock bathed in tetracycline to address anaplasmosis gain weight fast, become obese. Those that consume the meet gain weight. Strictly grass fed offers strength to the microbiome, and healthy weight gain. With tetracycline, beef need 11 months to harvest; on organic grass, it's 28. Taste is trashed with antibiotic. Few notice: primitive peoples are not suffering with C19 as we are. They are not over medicated. Our elderly are the canary in the mineshaft."
2021-03-14 05:49:55,"My mother was 93 when she fell at home. A severely broken hip led to  post surgery rehab at this “5 star” Florida facility. This was the place to be, highly recommended if you needed such care. There were presentations at her condo and some intermingling of condo residents and Board members of the facility. Condo residents in need of long term term care or assisted living were a pipeline of clients for the nursing facility. I arrived to find my mothers’ health deteriorating after a few weeks at the home. She had increased difficulty eating that required adjustments to her food. I spoke with social worker then dietitian, first  by phone, no easy feat, ultimately in person, stressing the urgency to change the food she was served, adjust portions, preparation, etc. It still distresses me to remember that none of this happened. Her internist said she was not progressing as he hoped but a review of her medications indicated one or two of the medications he prescribed were contraindicated because she was diabetic. We decided to take my mother home and bring in hospice. The facility was incapable of providing my mother care she required, deserved, perhaps hastening her demise. Dying comes when it comes but to cause harm and suffering through ineptitude is tragic. By reporting distorted data these institutions trivialize the essential services they should provide for the very real needs of vulnerable, predominantly elderly people. It truly is criminal in intent."
2021-03-14 06:35:46,There needed to be strict regulations on how many staff on floor as in actually working on patient care.Too many false staff on hand reports done with creative writing instead of facts.The number of people who need assistance with food can be staggering at lunch with not enough staff to get hot meals on time.These facilities are untrusted to take care of the elderly in society and its past time for them to do a better job and all of society should demand it and help get that care in place.
2021-03-14 06:54:23,"As one who works as an Aging Life Care® Advocate for my clients who have the misfortune to need a nursing home, I have certainly seen that the 5 Star system is indeed a joke! 
 As soon as you see that the facility has more than 10 citations in their recent Survey AND they are self-reporting on issues as serious as falls and such...you know those who still have 5 Stars are misrepresenting themselves in some way, and have figured out the 'math' behind the Stars.  To see that facilities can 'count' administrative nurses who I have never seen in my almost 20 years in this business out on the floor EVER -  unless there was an Earthquake...seems certainly another flaw in the 'math.'  That CMS allows it to be counted - shame on you!  
If this pandemic ACTUALLY teaches CMS some hard lessons on how to actually rate these places, that would be a Miracle!  NOTHING substitutes for one having a visit there (unannounced of course! - pre-COVID, I know!) and smelling the whole unit, looking at the trays of food an hour AFTER the meal is served (for food quality), and listening to some of the residents talking..complaining or just visiting...and then seeing their showering areas...mildew?? and counting the active staff on the floor...I take a few visits before I am confident to refer anyone!  Good luck to all!"
2021-03-14 07:57:13,"Hospital ratings, outside the nursing home industry also give pause for questioning. I have a rare medical condition, which I believe would be easy to cure. I live near well regarded medical facilities. Yet, Basically there is no reward for innovative cures, for conditions outside medical conditions, which draw ratings, and rankings.  Criteria which contribute to earning high positions, on ratings lists. Hospitals in the U.S., need to be rated well, in criteria like preventing people from dying from heart attack's, strokes, and cancer treatment.  Heart surgery is way up there in importance, as is Cancer treatment, for placement on the rating system. Oversight is badly needed, & important, in order to have top notch well rounded health care. Other countries, are making strides, in research and treatment for my rare condition."
2021-03-14 08:36:03,Is there nothing that private equity can’t make worse?
2021-03-14 09:58:10,"It is exceedingly difficult for the general public to evaluate homes. I visited a couple a few years ago trying to help friends who needed a place for an elderly relative being discharged from the hospital. As a pastor, I was somewhat familiar with both of them. In my previous nursing career I had worked in a nursing home in another state. I knew what questions to ask. Still, I was well aware that there was so very much I could not see and could not know.

 A member of the general public without my experience and knowledge, someone stressed by the need to find a place for a relative, is even less likely to be able to do any kind of worthwhile evaluation of the facility. We NEED good government oversight. We need a ratings system we can count on - and adequate discipline for facilities which do not comply."
2021-03-14 10:51:05,"The issue is much bigger than the star rating. All societies have to decide what meaningful role and what place elderly people should have in society. In other cultures they actually have a place in everyday life and aren't parked away in a stifling home to vegetate in front of TVs and without meaningful occupation.

Also, we have to confront the issue that it's OK for people to die when that time comes. Keeping people alive is immoral if they don't have 1) the will to live, 2) a chance to live a meaningful life without being enslaved medical treatment (umpteen medicines, respirator etc) or 3) just may simply feel that it's time."
2021-03-14 11:26:52,"As with everything in life, the severity of punishment for bad behavior to a great extent determines how much bad behavior there is.  Maybe giving the government false information should be a crime -- and if it already is, maybe there should be more resources put into prosecutions?  Maybe the state inspector who got $500,000  (and the people who paid him) should have gotten more time in prison?"
2021-03-14 11:35:18,"Like so many aspects of the health care system in the US, it's profits before people. Hopefully Americans will finally wake up to the insanity of turning our collective health care over to a system that incentives poor care. 

Law suits just might be the best remedy for these heartless, shameless abuses that so often occur. Only when these corporations suffer genuine financial loss will they make the required improvements. How sad is that? 

But we cannot rely entirely on the courts to right these wrongs. Hopefully one major change in our nation's priorities under this new administration will be to abandon the fiction that the profit incentive produces high quality health care. As is clear in this case, as in so many others, the opposite is true."
2021-03-14 11:39:11,"There will prove to be far too many of us with similar stories about our elderly loved ones. 

My most fervent hope is that this reporting does not stop as the country nears a state of normalcy with the virus. The problem of unscrupulous and uncaring nursing home facilities has been with us far longer than Covid has."
2021-03-14 12:16:48,"I'm an RN in a RI nursing home.  Whatever the shortcomings in our state, I can assure you we never know exactly when state inspectors are coming.  Our facility is not perfect, but a lot of effort goes into providing safe care.  Electronic medical records are harder to fake, so make sure any facility you consider uses them.  I work in a family-run home, and as a nurse who sees many different departments, from wound care to administration, I know our records are accurate reflections of what actually happens.   Covid was a true nightmare.  I won't minimize that.  But when a dementia resident falls victim, aggressive treatment is not always appropriate.  Hard to hydrate someone who rips out all the tubing repeatedly.  And if the family declines hospitalization, there is little else to offer.  When COVID makes it in to a wing with dementia residents, there is no such thing as infection control - some of them are in everyone else's rooms on a daily basis, and there's no way to keep a mask on them.  Not that I blame families for declining hospitalization or invasive care for critically ill dementia residents.  Dementia is a horrible thing - letting the victim go is often a kindness.  If you don't believe me, you need to spend time caring for someone with end-stage dementia."
2021-03-14 12:22:55,"Nursing homes are congregate settings where residents live in 1, 2, 3, and 4-bedded rooms. The average nursing home is 120 beds so approximately 150 people come in and out every day. No one and I mean no one understood the assymptomatic nature of how this virus spread in the 1st few months. PPE was scarce in the world and every health care setting had to implement extended use of PPEs which is not a good infection control practice but was the only option. Nursing homes were not prioritized in the healthcare continuum. In fact, FEMA was confiscating PPE from the shipping ports and distributing them to hospitals even though they were bought and paid for by nursing home providers. Testing was
beyond scarce for the 1st few months when a majority of deaths occurred. State governors made ill advised decisions to force nursing homes to accept Covid+ pts into their centers so hospitals could have enough beds. And lastly, the public should know that states have refused to fund the long term care sector properly and have underfunded nursing homes an average of $40-50 per patient day for decades. That is the accurate picture of what happened so reading reports like this that paint nursing homes in this way make me sick. No one should forget what really happened and change should come in the form of appropriate funding and prioritizing the long term care sector as a valued part of the health care continuum."
2021-03-14 12:26:42,"It's time that public assistance becomes available for families that take care of their elderly, whether by attending to them personally or hiring qualified assistance in the home."
2021-03-14 12:32:51,"My 98 year old healthy vibrant father fell, was sent to the hospital and determined he had a fractured pelvis and ribs.  They recommended ""rehab,"" was sent to Alliance Health at Marina Bay Quincy and somehow developed ""Acute Dementia"" from which he died 3 weeks later.  I can't even find this facility on any government website and after reading this article and frightened to imagine how many of these facilities exist without any oversight."
2021-03-14 12:41:37,"I am 75 and hopefully I will never need a nursing facility I know of a facility in Roslyn Heights that I would gladly pay for as it is more like a retreat than an elder residence  but I get the feeling  that is the exception rather than the rule The rose colored glasses that  recent nursing graduates have on I am sure, quickly dissipate when the real world of  caring for elderly people hits them. My own mother was in a NYC run home and received good care I never had a feeling that she was over medicated or deprived"
2021-03-14 12:44:46,"I work in a nursing home, as a Social Worker, and though I agree with much of what has been reported here, I want to defend nursing homes in general. The one for which I work
has a truly gifted rehabilitation team, and I've seen people regain strength and the ability to walk after strokes and accidents.  The nurses, who dispense medications, are conscientious, and most of the C.N.A.'s, who deliver the personal care, are outstanding. 
And, once we recognized that COVID was so contagious, we quickly shut down the building to visitors. We had many cases, and some deaths, early on, but none after May, 2020. 
One piece of advice I have for anyone going into rehab themselves, or looking for care for an elderly person, is to look for a non-profit facility. Try to avoid the for-profit entities, as their focus is less likely to be on patient care."
2021-03-14 13:00:20,"Nothing surprising here, but this article at this time could cause a reexamination of the whole notion of self reporting, and not just with respect to private equity owned elder care facilities. Long before the CMS rating system, the health care industry was gaming HEDIS reports. Depending on the flavor of the day, word would go out to staff at a prominent managed care organization to ramp up efforts to look good for HEDIS. As a result of this constant focus on HEDIS measures, problems that  were not captured by HEDIS would get few resources. While I never observed the organization falsify data, their bias was more toward marketing the HEDIS scores than toward truth. Given the extreme incentives of private equity, the imagination is not overworked thinking of ways self reporting could go wrong without frequent surprise government audits in situations where the customers are often nearly unable to advocate for themselves."
2021-03-14 13:08:46,"I worked in long-term facilities and adult day programs for over 30 years, retired now. It's past time that the problems in nursing homes come to light. Staffing is inadequate which leads to problems including falls,  poor care, hospitalizations. When questioned a facility will say that is meets the state regs in staffing. Time to improve the state regs! Meals that are healthy and appropriate to a resident's ethnic background, recreation programs that are vital to quality of life can prevent falls by keeping residents active and engaged and give meaning to life. I've seen the difference this can make. The whole issue of staffing. Poor staffing weekends and evenings, lack of supervision for residents, falls, staff turnover. So much change for people who have experienced so many losses and changes  in their lives. I've worked with many staff that care, that work hard and are doing their best for the residents. Most people, unless they have worked in or placed a family member in a facility are unaware of these problems. 
People would say to me, isn't working in a nursing home depressing? It never was. A smile from a resident, a wave, a touch a positive word from a family, I always knew how much good I was doing. Care should be more important than profit.

Thank you to The Times for this article."
2021-03-14 13:15:23,"As long as shareholder value is the imperative, care will be substandard. Simple principle: for a net profit of around 5%, there has to be a gross profit of 10-20%. That means 10 to 20% less care for the residents."
2021-03-14 13:17:01,"self-regulating -- what could possibly go wrong

first of all, the government should be held accountable because they put a system in place which has misled vulnerable individuals but then did not provide the resources to make sure the ratings meant anything
secondly there should be criminal investigations and prosecutions for this utter disregard and neglect of human beings
thirdly do not think that some non-profit are necessarily more likely to provide good care -- especially government-run facilities although benevolent run or religious organizations will most likely be at the top of the list in caring for their residents"
2021-03-14 13:39:06,"This is the most accurate reporting on the state of nursing homes I have found after being responsible for four elderly family members. Filing complaints through a broken system has proven useless.  I also suggest investigating the linkage between the skilled nursing facilities and assisted living facilities. Please keep bringing these abuses to public attention. We need to protect our seniors rather than leave them to corrupt and often criminal for profit enterprises. These are not isolated incidents but a larger pattern of abuse - profit without accountability.   Private ownership must be held accountable.   Keep doing the important work you do, please."
2021-03-14 13:58:05,"Great reporting. There's a big clue to the problem in this brief parenthesis: ""(Today, for-profit companies own about 70 percent of all U.S. nursing homes.)"" No one should profit from healthcare. Fair compensation, yes. Corporate greed, no."

2021-03-14 14:35:40,"Sounds about like restaurant health inspections. Owners and managers usually know well in advance, schedule intense cleaning sessions that don’t at all reflect the daily maintenance that one would expect to find on any given day. Often times they buddy up to the inspectors, maybe even buy them drinks/gifts. More serious infractions get downplayed or ignored."
2021-03-14 15:04:43,"In my state of Pennsylvania (and I think in most states) nursing homes/assisted care facilities are licensed and regulated by the state government. In my experience there are at least annual inspections, mandatory reports of injuries, such as falls or bed sores, and most complaints by family are followed up aggressively. The CMA ratings are certainly considered, and everybody tries to increase their ratings, but are an add-on to the state supervision."
2021-03-14 15:28:50,"As others have commented, family members must make it a priority to ensure that their loved one is taken care of.  I found that it was important to let it be known that I expected a certain level of care and if was not being given, I would make sure I would seek and notify any authority I could to make sure that that my mother would have the care she needed.  It also meant that I had to move her out of a facility when I did not see any changes.  Additionally, I made it clear that if the staff assigned to care for my mother were not doing their job, then they needed to be re-trained or substituted with other more capable staff.   If you do not show up for your loved one, then they will not get the care they deserve.  If they get the impression the family does not care, they will not care.  Yes this is disturbing, but it is also the reality of this type of care.  Even the nursing home staff that do care are burdened with having to heed management's goals of profit. 
There are local or state agencies responsible for assisting the family with these type of issues - use them as your advocate."
2021-03-14 16:21:53,"How could there possibly be a problem using a 5 star book rating scheme to ""measure"" nursing homes?  

Point being... there is ZERO real world consequence for a book to get either a 1 or 5 star rating.  Zero.

2021-03-14 16:32:49,"Tomorrow I plan to call the office of Senator Susan Collins, Chair of the Senate Committee on Aging to be sure she is aware of the issues of the Medicare rating system and to demand an investigation and change.  I encourage everyone to do the same.
It was very upsetting to read this as I relied heavily on these ratings when making choices for my parents and have recommended that cousins, friends etc do the same. 
Of course nothing takes the place of constantly visiting and monitoring the care and environment where your loved ones reside. This article shows that how imperative this is for accountability.  The government is failing our seniors. This must be addressed."
2021-03-14 16:43:29,"It's obvious as the nose on your face: the nursing home and assisted living industry donates many millions to legislators to make sure regulations are kept as weak as possible and that for laws and regulations in place that funding for enforcement is kept underfunded. Also, when fines are assessed, they routinely are able to have them reduced or voided all together.   Seniors and their families are routinely ripped off. The industry is far better at messaging than in delivering the quality care they advertise."

2021-03-14 17:11:33,"Shall we ever admit the truth to ourselves, or each other?

If these nursing homes are for-profit, their sole responsibility & purpose for existing is NOT to care for patients.  

Their sole legal obligation is to enrich their shareholders to the maximum degree possible.  It's part of U.S. Corporate Law (as interpreted by SCOTUS back in the 70s, I think.) 

This entails constant cost-cutting, among other profit-producing measures. 

A for-profit nursing-home  is liable to their shareholders for every nurse they hire, every Depends they buy.  But not for suffering or death unless they get sued.

After all, their product is NOT healthcare, which is only a means to an end. It is the same product as all corporations: profit.

This is why all products & services in the private sector are getting worse by the day, it seems, & why no matter how rich or huge corporations get, or how productive the workforce, pay gets worse, jobs get fewer, working conditions get worse, products get absurdly worse but still cost ever more, consumer choice shrinks, but anti-consumer lobbying never stops -- Big Business can never have enough because that's what Maximization of Profit means.

If leaching all human productivity dry to pile up in ever fewer & ever more massive coffers is the be-all & end-all of business activity in the world -- moving in all things in the *opposite direction* to the*spread* of prosperity -- how can any society EVER function decently?"
2021-03-14 17:14:11,"When my mother was in a nursing home, I looked at Nursing Home Compare and found the same inaccuracies and limitations you note.  I found it most useful to read the state surveys of the nursing home.  Those conduct detailed reviews of samples of residents and often reveal real problems beneath the 5-star NHC ratings."
2021-03-14 17:26:30,"My daughter is a dedicated CNA and has worked in many rehab centers and a couple of nursing homes.  She knows first hand the corruption and crime that takes place in them by administrators/owners and staff.  She now works as a private in-home caregiver.

It is absolutely criminal that BIG investors were allowed to buy up hospitals, rehab centers and nursing homes without serious regulation and taxation.  Their profit-uber-alles is killing OUR senior citizens - thanks to Medicare and medicaid funding being stolen by BIG business.

It is time to SERIOUSLY  break up, regulate and tax the entire complex."
2021-03-14 17:30:46,"Horrible article. 
What's needed is data on the percentage of nursing home patients that die in any given year. Most folks go into a nursing home mainly because they're not doing so well and probably don't have a decade left to live. If family is nearby their medical needs are more than the relatives can handle. 
If that number is more than 10%, which I suspect it is, it wouldn't be surprising that Covid has killed 1/10 nursing home residents. William Osler, the father of modern medicine, called pneumonia the old man's friend. Viral or bacterial, it's always been a significant route the Grim Reaper sends old folks to the morgue. Happens every year with flu season only difference is Covid is much worse than the typical influenza virus. 
Would be interesting to see data for nursing homes that are non-profit. As usual, the culprits in this story are ""for-profit"" along with shareholders expecting a ROI."
2021-03-14 17:37:07,In October is 2020 my aunt went into a rehab/and in Westchester after a hospitalization where she became quite deconditoned. The care was terrible and her medical conditioned deteriorated. When I spoke to the physician who cared for he told me I had no right to question him as he is the doctor and he knows what he is doing. My uncle was called at 6 o’clock on a Friday night to tell him he was now responsible for the bill since her insurance had denied her stay. There was issue after another. It was rare if you ever got to speak with anyone without calling back more than a half dozen times. She gradually became more and more edematous but was never sent to the hospital. Her doctor “knew what he was doing”. She was discharged to home completely inappropriately. A very unsafe plan. Her conditioned worsened and she died a week later in the hospital. This was all compounded by covid and my uncle never got to see her while she was there. We were told this was a 5 star facility. I looked it up after and Medicare CMS did rate it 5 stars. I could go on and on. I am a nurse practitioner and in reality terrified to get into such a situation. Our health care is seriously failing us.

2021-03-14 17:48:08,"This article brought a flood of emotion. 
Several years ago, my brother-in-law was admitted to a nursing home in San Diego. He was dying of kidney failure, and had to be admitted because my husband and I could no longer look after him. 
When I went to visit him one day, I got to see first hand how indifferent these places really are. My brother was complaining about being ignored and neglected and about the medicine he took to control a wracking cough. He told me that one of the care workers had switched his prescription drug, which was a red color, to a far less effective clear drug. Inquiries into the matter went nowhere. The care manager insisted we were wrong, but we believed that his prescription-strength drug was stolen by an employee to be sold on the streets.
When I visited at another time, the staff was serving lunch. My brother was given a starvation ration of low-quality food; when I complained, the staff retreated, leaving us high and dry. I was furious, and walked the floors, demanding help. The only response I got was from a medical supply saleswoman who happened to be making a call that day. She very kindly brought me some better food from the kitchen.
Unbelievable! 
My husband and I got brother out ASAP, and took him home to a combination of hospice and hospital care until his passing."
2021-03-14 17:54:42,"It's the same story in Australia. Private equity moved into nursing homes, executed huge takeovers and looked for ways to cut costs. They replaced nurses with care assistants, dumped ill residents in hospital emergency wards, and the band played on. Standards of care were not met but the Government agency supposed to monitor care quality was totally captured by the private operators.  All of this was exposed in a commission of inquiry the Government was forced to hold, but I'm not holding my breath for real change. As a nation,  we tend to be so afraid of advanced old age that we ignore the realities."

Yes, CMS star system is flawed but did you know nursing homes are more highly regulated than nuclear power plants? And most of them rely on government funding so the direct care workers get paid nothing! Also, why should homes be penalized by staff or residents acting out randomly? As long as proper background checks were completed, rape or murder can’t be predicted. Where is your criticism of hospitals who often send patients to nursing homes without consulting family, before the patient is clinically ready and with new pressure sores? Hospitals get away with much shadier stuff. There’s also a national nursing shortage and why would anyone want to work for nursing home wiping butts for $13 and then read about their home in a wonderful article like this? I hope you have the luxury to never need a nursing home because that’s not the case for many. Maybe you could provide solutions instead of criticism for something you don’t understand."

The care for residents is sub par and the treatment of staff is often  worse no matter how fancy the lobby is and how warm and fuzzy their advertising may appear.  

In any case, do your homework ahead of time if you care about your elders.  Making a selection during a crisis is the worst possible method and looking into home care companies should be on your agenda as well. 

Do everything you can to stay sound and out of their clutches."

People might find it interesting  to look at the UK site of the government care quality commission cqc.org.uk which is the government oversight survey of nursing homes.   Nursing home scandals definitely do occur in the UK (just as scandals in homes for people with disabling conditions).  Still  when you wonder if you want your care or that of people you love to be in a ""nanny state"" you might think that sometimes a nanny is just what you need.   Especially if the nanny is overseen by an independent group  who are conscientious and brave enough to speak truth to power."

Momentary tsk-tsk's will never repair a shameful  template ...proposed 'band-aids' suddenly and virtuously heralded now fly in the face of reality for baked-in systemic failures to ethically protect the most vulnerable.

I worked in health care.  I have witnessed that the souls that require  much needed care, both physical and emotional  are treated as a profitable commodity. Personal hygiene , a clean environment, a healthy diet, addressing  emotional needs  and, adequate staffing with qualified employees  was not on the top of the list. The primary objective is  profit share, the '5 star rating.' 

What I witnessed was a population of souls that were viewed as  lives who were  no longer of any use, any value  to society . Expendable souls who live for the profit of others. 

Unionize employees who will be protected and able to speak the truth about the care offered and employee more inspectors. This  is the only way to stop the horrendous and heartless life experiences far too many souls  are living."

The “cleaner” slept and watched TV in the room across the hall where a non verbal patient slept. Staff refused to clean the room. I refused to allow Dad to be removed from the stretcher. The RN supervisor said they didn’t have the staff or time to clean after the previous occupant died. (It’s called Terminal Disinfection, a requirement). CMS gave this dump 4 stars. I cleaned with supplies I scavenged for then remained with him until his transfer 12 hours later. The next place had 5 stars. He died there after a month, bedsores all over.

I saw a new co worker making up data for his clients because he and his staff had forgotten to document working on their clients' goals. And his paperwork was due tothe social workers that day. A manager helped him do it. I'm not a BIT surprised that inspections were few and far between. And if you don't think the business caring for your loved one hides information from family members you are very,very naive.
 I took a co workers client for a Dr's visit.He was severely underweight. I raised hell and they moved him to a different home.The one nursing home I worked in for a very brief time was clean, and the staff were certified CNA's, who were rock stars. But they worked at a RUN.People haven't wanted this information, EVER. The people who REALLY care for our loved ones are making $11-12 an hour. The most senior, if they are a certified CNA, may be making $15 or $16. I live in what is considered an urban area in my state. $9,$10,or MAYBE $11 an hour is a starting wage. Some,god help them, pay less. Looking at YOU WalMart,and any gas station worker--I made $12 as a supervisor of a DD adult home 15 years ago!

This past week, thousands of families across 17 states, in a coordinated national campaign (www.isolationkills.org), have been petitioning their officials to let us back into facilities. Many of us have witnessed exactly what you have illuminated in this article, protected our loved ones from it, and then were locked out for over a year (as of this writing, my family is still not receiving visitation with my father). Yesterday at a rally in Los Angeles  a woman stopped me and asked, ""But isn't it over? Didn't they let you back in?"". We need to educate people on what is really going on. No, we aren't actually ""back in"". Some states are still holding to their own guidelines and ignoring CMS. And Hell no this isn't over. We need a federally designated essential caregiver so that this will never happen again. That is just the tip of this very sharp and formidable iceberg. Thank you for this article. We, the families, have been shouting into what has felt like a well for too long.

I would recommend that the Times focus next on the low-rated, Medicaid nursing homes, which are a disaster.  We have the perfect storm in this country of underfunded Medicaid payments, to a privatized nursing home industry, without sufficient random auditing, and without meaningful consequence for facilities with multiple, endless repeating citations and failures.  What do we think is going to happen with that combination?  It's not just the big problems of poor health care, lack of responsiveness and attention, and overuse of anti-depressants, it's also the common humanity things like food.  Is it too much to ask that we as a society provide the funds and oversight to require nursing homes to provide actually edible, healthy foods with a variety that meets the different eating needs and preferences of residences?  They say you can judge a society by how it treats its prisoners, true, and you can also judge the compassion and commitment of a society by how it treats its elders.  Sadly, Covid has exposed a crisis that was already there, swept under our collective rug."

If such licenses were required of people in advertising, marketing, and public relations, these industries as we know them now would cease to exist.  Enough high-paying jobs would be eliminated that the economy would crash."

The doctor's PA saw him 48 hours later, casually glanced at my husband for all of 5 seconds, while standing at the foot of the bed, and prescribed an antibiotic.

It would also be interesting to me to see a system wide assessment.  The post acute care architecture always looked like a dumping ground to get patients out of hospital beds ASAP.  

Private equity doesn't move in unless there are ways to suck the profits out of the system.  And they would want cover from Congress, which appears to be offered by both Republicans and Democrats.  

Multiple federal administrations have reviewed the potential for pandemics to occur.  And yet the focus on health care has been to  optimize for profits and high salaries for executives.  

It's a shame because there are some great activities like the Green Houses which were going in a better direction.  

More power in the hands of consumers might help, so the 'system' is designed to discourage that possibility.  Maybe NYT reporting and the terrible death rates will start to change that."

When she left due to health reasons, the new director was never interviewed by staff, residents, or family members.  The decision came from corporate.  This was my mother's home!  And I was paying a lot in ""rent."" I contacted the corporate offices and recommended that there be a council made up of cognitively intact residents and family members who would have a role in how the place was run and decisions were made. As a nurse and my parents' caregiver for years, I would have been happy to serve on a ""tenants"" council. I received a form letter in reply.

Every corporate board for nursing care facilities should have a percentage of ""consumers"" as members.  Every facility should have a similar council.  Not as tokens, but as decision makers who can review finances and management decisions."
2021-03-14 20:30:50,"As usual, a process that simply is/was too corruption work. Now that this problem is getting the attention it so clearly deserved, let's see exactly how these misguided, illiterate managers and administrators are held accountable.

This is just another example of how bureaucracy works. No accountability, no reason, no need for concern.  

The infrastructure of this country that needs to be repaired aren't the bridges and highways, it's the corruption and inefficiency that permeate every single recipient of a federal or state dollar engaged in a funded program."

2021-03-14 21:09:38,"Some hospitals use a “five star” ranking which is puzzling to patients, including me."
2021-03-14 21:01:59,"Clearly the “star” system of ratings is terminally broken, and other than a trial-and-error placement carrousel, has any reader here actually found a reliable method of ascertaining the worthiness or desirability of any one particular elder-care facility in one’s community?  There is only so much one can discover during a typical pre-admittance “tours”, which usually occur during the day and between meals, with only a perfunctory assessment of “care” visible to visitors.  Some even discourage speaking to residents if not related, or otherwise known to staff.  So, what is one to do, given the all-round sad state of affairs?"
2021-03-14 21:18:15,"As many have commented,  “for profit” and “equity owned” nursing homes are treating seniors akin to chickens warehoused in factory coops.  Any one with a loved one who was in one of these places knows. They know how staff uses wheelchairs as restraint. Overmedicates patients so they are zombies. Physical therapy is a joke. Staff sits behind a desk and patients are left to go to the bathroom in a diaper. Will congress stop Medicare & Medicaid payments to these institutions? Will they outlaw ownership of these homes by out of state entities?  Will they buck up and refuse campaign donations from these places and put a stop to this? Will you call your congressperson tomorrow and demand action? Will not for profit community minded homes replace these atrocities.  Staff needs to be paid attractively.  We clamor about teacher salaries for children but no one gives voice to the elderly and infirm. Most nursing homes are unattractive not modern and the food terrible."
2021-03-14 21:27:22,"Nursing homes are the place no one wants to go. Imagine what it's like for people who have no family or friends who can advocate for them. Better to be in prison, truly. But what is being done to change this revolting picture. Why are none of these institutions being shut down or their administrative staff not being actively prosecuted in court? They are killing our most vulnerable people and at best, leaving them to spend their final days in hell. We need a medical system that incentivizes non-profits with strong unions for the nurses and aides."
2021-03-14 21:34:15,"I worked in senior living for 8 years. It was a 5-star environment, and earned every one of those stars. But of course, the three facilities were not-for-profit. It makes a huge difference, and any time someone asks for my help in choosing a placement for a loved one, I always put that as #1 on the list.

However, about that ""knowing when the inspectors will arrive..."" Very often you have an excellent idea. Every residence has a ""window"" when their inspection is due. Leading up to that window, if you have any brains or pride, you go over your records to make sure they are in order, go over your training with your staff to make sure they are doing things properly, get on the maintenance staff to be sure every lightbulb is clean or replaced, every call light is working, every toilet is flushing, etc. In other words, you prep for the queen's visit. And you don't stop. As the window gets closer, you do it more often. As your window starts to close, if the state hasn't shown up yet, you get even closer into the details. You talk to others in your area whose windows are near yours. They share information on how rigid their inspections were, or how easy, or on new inspectors that showed up. You know how many days an inspection takes, so you can guess how long it will be before they get to you. So, yes, it is possible to be ready and waiting when, bright and early one day, they show up at the front door and paste that sticker on the entry that says they are there."

DO NOT send your loved one to a skilled nursing facility (SNF) unless you plan to be there frequently, on a varying schedule and observe carefully. Have the Ombudsman on speed dial. Get to know the admin, the nurses and the aides. Become their worst nightmare if they don't take good care of your loved one. Tell them you are going to report them to the county and/or the state, and do it if they don't improve. Make sure they know that you mean business.  Look in the corners for dirt. Look at your loved ones skin, any bony prominence that would rub against their bed or wheelchair ( heels, ankles, elbows, shoulder blades, and their buttocks . A pressure ulcer can start in 2 hours and if left untreated is life threatening.  Personally, I would rather die before going to any of these places."
2021-03-14 22:03:22,"My mother was an RN who had once briefly worked in a nursing home, and she was adamant about insisting she never wanted to be put in one. She got vascular dementia as she got older, and I wanted her to live with me and my family, but she insisted on living in her own home. 

At one point I tried to pressure her into moving into an assisted living center near me - it appeared to be a resort-like place where she could make friends, have her independence, and I could see her every day. 

I thought her ideas about nursing homes were outdated. But although at that point her cognitive abilities were impaired, she politely but firmly refused. After reading this article as well as others on the horrors of nursing homes that have been revealed during the pandemic, I realize that even while incapacitated, she was far wiser than me. 

She stayed in her home and one of our relatives was paid to live with her and be her caretaker. She had two devoted little dogs she took for walks around the block every day, just as she had done for so many years. She was a really good person, and I am so glad she was able to live out her days without being subjected to the indignities, neglect and even abuse suffered by the residents of these nursing homes."

2021-03-12 18:53:47,"My wife and I are both family doctors, and, over the years, we have really come to hate family medicine as it is currently structured in the US.

It isn't the patients or the long hours.  We signed up for that. It's the administrative nonsense and the fact that doctors are now underlings to business types.  Being forced by the system to spend three hours per day after clinic hours typing medically pointless data into soul-crushing electronic medical records pushed me into early retirement.

Needless to say, our kids won't be going to med school. Too smart for that.  I advise wise medical parents to discuss these issues with any children who might be considering family medicine."
2021-03-12 19:12:17,"It truly has been one wild, stressful, unpredictable, and erratic year for physicians, nurses, and anyone else who plays a part in the health care system at all. 

Working in criminal defense, I can usually be counted on to generally have the most interesting, wild, and anxiety-inducing, work related experiences and stories. Yet this year, I found most of mine tame in comparison to my girlfriend's, who works at an urgent care. 

It is difficult enough to be the person everyone else relies on and turns to in a time of such unmitigated pandemonium. To consider the added burden of having to contend against your own loss at the same time is profoundly more challenging. These are the true heroes of this era."
2021-03-12 19:16:27,"As a front line health care provider - an Emergency Medicine physician - I was among the first group to be vaccinated here in LA County. My concern is that my partner, at home, has not been vaccinated because she does not meet any of the established criteria. However I am taking care of highly contagious Covid-19 patients day after day, significantly increasing her risk of infection. 

I think family members of health care providers should be eligible for the vaccine sooner. While I am vaccinated, we still don't know what the likelihood of having an asymptomatic infection is - consequently our families are still at much higher risk than average despite exercising the utmost precaution.  

Somehow this significantly increased risk isn't recognized by the vaccine decision makers, creating additional stress on front line providers.  

We hear and read about rich people or favored people or people with ""ins"" getting vaccinated ahead of their appropriate slot.

Now that the most vulnerable elderly and their caregivers have been vaccinated, it is time to recognize the sacrifice made by family members of front line providers - and their higher risk for getting Covid-19.  

My partner has supported me every day, every shift, and has put her fears aside as best as she can.  She deserves to be protected."
2021-03-12 19:31:10,"My sincere condolences to all the medical professionals who lost family members in this article.  It is helpful to have family members who you can relate to and debrief with when coming off a difficult shift. COVID brought a new level of fear for healthcare workers and family members who have been exposed at work and have been afraid of getting or giving the people you love this infection.  

I was very lucky. In the last year, my exposure was not as frequent as others and I mostly had access to PPE.  As far as I know, I wasn’t infected. Despite laws in place and multiple exposures, my workplace NEVER tested me or other coworkers.  The only way people I worked with discovered they were infected was to go through their private insurance and physicians after they were symptomatic.  I know many coworkers whose exposure was greater and more frequent than mine, they were never tested either.  I will give credit to our hospital for vaccinating employees very early and making vaccines readily available to most all employees.  However, it seems like they never really wanted to know if we had the virus to start with, despite our exposure and families to care for when we went home after work.

I’ve since been vaccinated, but I thank my lucky stars every day my partner nor I ever got sick."
2021-03-12 19:12:51,"What puzzles me most is why haven’t we seen more health care workers walk outs? Done strategically, these could have forced politicians to face the reality that their actions and lack of action directly caused thousands of deaths. When the hospitals were bursting, heart attacks and femur fractures took Covid home and had suboptimal care. As a society, we tolerated causing moral and physical injury to our precious health care workers, we will all suffer as a result."
2021-03-12 19:53:24,"There is a risk of being a health care worker that all health care workers are aware of and accept willingly in order to care for our countrymen.

2021-03-12 20:28:28,"These deaths could have been prevented had the federal and state governments offered massive assistance to health care workers and demanded nationwide conformity with preventive measures. Instead, many elected officials were more concerned about corporate profits while almost half the country was paranoid about ""rights"" being stripped away.

Those politicians and members of the public bear direct moral responsibility for the excessive death toll."
2021-03-12 20:32:24,"I appreciate that the physicians and nurses pictured are all people of color. Minorities, especially african americans, are vastly underrepresented in medicine. Imagine the healthcare disparities that could be addressed if only more healthcare workers and leaders more closely represented the people we serve. It is important for medical schools and residencies to increase representation, by recruiting minorities into medicine. 

In addition, the federal government needs to increase funded residency positions. There are plenty of physicians in the pipeline who cannot find residency spots, exacerbating the shortage of primary care in the US and, compounded with increasing administrative burdens, leads to increased burnout among physicians."

I was struck  by the term ""intubation team"".  This said in capital letters that the situation was so dire that there was a group devoted entirely to airway management, the ""A"" if you will, in resuscitation.   

I also burned out. The workload, chronic lack of sleep, hurry, and sense of futility of what I was doing were all contributory.  But I never had to deal with the worry of becoming infected myself or infecting others in my family. I did not push myself to work long hours at high risk, often with inadequate PPE, to help others, Medal of Honor behavior had they been in the military.  I did not have to deal with a country where far too many not only refused to accept the situation but actively tried to make it worse. 

I also had the then-luxury of practicing in an era where the president didn't accuse me of faking diagnoses to increase billing, and where many in Congress outright denying there was an issue.

Banging pots and ""hero"" are fluff.  Change in human behavior, PPE, less bickering would have been far more welcome."
2021-03-12 22:28:32,"The pandemic brought to light how poorly prepared hospitals and healthcare workers were to deal with the crisis. This was further magnified by lack of proper supplies and gear needed to safely and adequately manage the rolling avalanche. But, the hospitals expected things to remain the same when it came to extensive documentation . So it was double or treble the load for the frontline workers. Save lives and stick to hospital and health insurance company protocols (by spending countless hours just in charting stuff). Now would be the ideal time to overhaul the system where redundant documentation and duplication of work( especially in the EMR)are thrown away for good. May we all see a new normal and do away with the old and inefficient ways of doing things which led to increasing burnout of doctors( much before this pandemic)."

( important to address LGBTQ inequality- but comes across as deaf to what is going on with covid and treatment option for the disease)"
2021-03-12 23:32:56,"Agree with the author’s thoughts and appreciate the attention to the topic.

But I think the biggest issue for me has been the sense of betrayal and abandonment — by my government throughout last year and by the administrators of some facilities.

No prep, PPE, ventilators — to start. Indeed the pandemic book had been shredded. Procure equipment? Great opportunity for inept guidance by friends, family grift and faulty equipment. Organize equipment yourself? Find it stolen by your govt. Or escalated to astronomical prices. Evtl garbage bags are being used, etc.

Suggest quack cures on national TV from the highest government level? Whatever. And evtl — govt decides the topic is boring — and bails. Etc.

Science experts? Respected internationally in the field? Ignore them. Silence them. Isolate them.  T h r e a t e n  them.

I thank you for the wonderful writing and for introducing me to colleagues who soldier on, suffering silently, some bereft through loss, others feeling unsupported, all under stress. I understand why some are retiring and also advising their children not to follow them into their professions. 

I am a neurosurgeon towards the end of my career. My son is following me into medical school and I couldn’t be more proud of him. I still love and am proud what I do, I love my patients, and feel great satisfaction knowing that I can make a profound difference in my patient’s lives. 

But this year, I have felt tested, almost to the breaking point. Without the social compact valuing my profession’s commitment to our patients and my society (I include all healthcare workers), I have been tempted to walk away. No PPE, no mask wearing, people who refuse to exercise empathy for those they call “heroes.” Shared sacrifice only makes sense if it is truly shared. When health systems leverage the good will of their workers without a concomitant and passionate commitment to them and to their well-being, practitioners are forced to choose self-preservation over self-sacrifice, and again are tempted to leave. 

But, in the end, I have chosen to double down on my commitment and stay. I have learned the one thing that matters most is the compassionate care of my fellow humans; empathy remains the core, sustaining value, and will outlast the pandemic. Thanks."

Meanwhile I'm a type 1 diabetic who was at the time pregnant. At first I felt like a military spouse saying goodbye every time he left, wondering if my toddler and I would see him again. We did the hotel quarantine thing. We stayed away from everyone. We felt like typhoid marys with our family. We acclimated to the fear. We had the baby, no visitors. She's healthy. We're grateful. Finally, he got vaccinated in December. And as a diabetic I was due for mine tomorrow. 
Freedom at last. No more fear when he came home that he was carrying the virus to me and the family. And then yesterday I and then my toddler tested positive for covid. My husband was sick first, a mild cold, but he was tested last because he's long fully vaccinated. It turns out he has it. He saw 40 patients the day he was likely exposed. My toddler has recovered. My whole body hurts. This is being part of medicine, I guess."

Daddy died March 25th in the Dominican Republic. I got the call the same day I got my first fever in New York after catching the virus at the nursing home I worked in.
I had spoken with him the night before, unaware that anything was different.  He didn’t say much except “I love you” repeatedly.  As a retired doctor, I am sure he knew what was coming and said nothing as he was stuck in that first lock-down on the little island. As a doctor, I was so preoccupied with the pandemic coming to sweep through my nursing home floor that I failed to notice that he was saying good-bye.

There would be no family gathering to grieve and see him off. He had a lonely little burial as I wondered between fevers if I would be leaving my daughter orphaned as well."
2021-03-12 23:10:49,"I am an ER doctor. For those of us in medicine (and this means ALL staff, not just doctors), this year has been truly horrific at times. Even pre-pandemic, there were many experiences- pronouncing the death of a child, informing a patient of a terminal illness, witnessing terrible elder or child abuse, trying but failing to save a dying person, etc- that we would bottle up and not share with our friends and families, because they didn’t ask for this misery and shouldn’t have to bear the burden of a job they didn’t choose. This kind of works, if you have other outlets to release your stress (and for most of us, counseling isn’t one of them, because state medical boards will investigate physicians who are in counseling). This year, though, those coping mechanisms have been stretched very thin. 
I anticipate a lot of early retirements, undiagnosed PTSD, and years of nightmares ahead for America’s medical staff."
2021-03-12 19:51:35,"Covid was the last straw. I retired after 35 years as a physician. It was an extremely difficult decision. Seeing patients dying of Covid and then seeing my community refusing to mask up and my state of Missouri refusing to mandate masks made my choice less difficult. My fellow citizens refuse to wear a mask and then expect others to risk their LIFE to save them. The risk to my family was just too high. I signed up to devote my time and expertise to improve the health of others. I did not sign up to risk my family's life.
I am fortunate I could leave medicine and sad that I had to make this choice. I feel deeply for those who must stay and am extremely grateful for all who do so."
2021-03-13 10:37:31,"It looks like most of the people writing comments are doctors! Me too. I work in an ICU, and sat with my dad in our own ICU as he died of COVID. I had the surreal experience of talking with him about goals of care, the same conversation I have had with so many patients. 

Ultimately, medicine is calling not a job. I've been given a lot of things I am pretty sure I don't deserve -- a comfortable and secure life, a lot of respect merely for what I do, an incredible amount of trust, the priviledge to help people is some of the hardest moments of their lives. And because of this, a lot is expected of us, including the stuff we have had to do in the last year."

2021-03-15 17:09:59,"All the money has ended up inflating the price of financial assets.   As soon as it is spent, it goes into the financial system and makes its way to the well-off who have more income than they spend.    This was especially true during the pandemic, when millions of well-off people were stuck at home and couldn't spend like they usually do.   

The result can be seen in stock prices, house prices, art prices - every thing that might be considered a store of value.   The well-off top 20% now have even more assets, along with undiminished income.   

So in the long run, these policies may prove to have negative consequences.   Sure, the well-off people will go travelling and go out to restaurants when the pandemic recedes, and service workers will be very busy and make lots of money.   But in terms of assets, there has been a further shift of wealth towards the upper middle class and higher."

""Millions of laid-off workers waited weeks or months to begin receiving help, often with lasting financial consequences. Aid to hundreds of thousands of small businesses dried up long before they could welcome back customers; many will never reopen. Long lines at food banks and desperate pleas for help on social media reflected the number of people who slipped through the cracks.""

I expect that things will bounce back much more quickly this time because the government responded faster with economic rescues during this crisis.  The government just responded with the 3rd economic rescue, which has helped keep the economy going while also helping out many individuals and businesses that have been suffering.  Those politicians who supported the three stimulus packages should be commended."
2021-03-15 17:42:09,"It's good the government acted, but even the recent American Rescue plan is very temporary. It doesn't make structural changes that would put us on a smoother glide path to consistent growth or lower inequality. The $1.9 trillion is largely a collection of one-time payments without a mechanism to extend them or pay for them...hopefully they help us out of the COVID hole but then we'll be back where we started with an economy that works well for some but not most. 

Raising the min wage was the one item that could have provided long-term structural change to our economy and it was stripped. I hope Congress and Biden are able to re-introduce it and then pass longer-term legislation that helps the vast majority of Americans (green & upgraded infrastructure, health care reform, tax changes so investment income isn't taxed at a lower rate than wage income, etc.)."

2021-03-15 17:39:07,"Getting back our economy to pre-pandemic would still be a nightmare.

Here's a summary of an evaluation of our pre-pandemic economy from a highly skilled UN observer:

""June 22 (UPI) -- A study for the U.N. Human Rights Council has concluded 40 million people in the United States live in poverty -- and more than half of those live in ""extreme"" or ""absolute"" poverty.

The 20-page report by Philip Alston, U.N. special rapporteur on extreme poverty and human rights, says U.S. policies benefit the rich and exacerbate poverty.""

But we should all read the full report; it's an unabashed look at us, as only an outside observer can do. Here's the link:

Our death rate per capita has been far, far higher than almost all our peers in northern Europe. 

Describing the partial list of steps that the U.S. took, out of the far larger list that were taken by Germany (where the state of human knowledge is no better than in the U.S.) actually shows that our policy makers got it wrong.  And even those partial steps were taken with inadequate magnitude.

Listen. Pfizer is merely distributing a vaccine invented by German scientists whose names the media fail to honor. (It's ""the Pfizer vaccine""?)

Extremely few German businesses went bankrupt, never to open again, because the government here really truly supported them fully. 

Zero people were evicted.  Relatively few people employed at any large companies lost their jobs (very few, compared with the U.S.) and even those who did suffered hardly at all compared with Americans:  their were unemployment benefits are extremely generous and lifestyle-sustaini ng, and last at full (much larger) size for 4 times as long as in the U.S. 

Freelancers received $6,000 govt checks eight months ago, for crissake.

Don't worry about German government debt (consequences of which are grossly exaggerated by U.S. politicians):  Germany's debt per GDP is anyway far lower than in the U.S., because it doesn't give ludicrous, corruption-fueled tax breaks to the unneedy rich."

A phenomenon where unemployed workers are forced to take jobs well below their experience and former pay grade due to anemic and short lived unemployment benefits. 

Sure, they are technically no longer unemployed. However, their longer term economic stability is severely compromised when forced to take a step backwards. Generous aid to these relatively affluent workers allowed them to hold out for more prosperous employment.

The figure I heard was a month searching for every $10,000 in salary earned. You’re not going to earn very much at your next job living off pre-pandemic unemployment benefits. The difference is made up by savings or not at all."

2021-03-15 20:25:48,"Whenever I read one of these articles, usually in the NYT, I wounder whether the hard workers and successful should feel ashamed of their success. Whether they should berate themselves for having worked hard, and saved . Because  according to this author, by their hard work and saving they unfairly fared better than others. Should these successful people have not worked so hard so they gained no advantage?  It used to be that working hard, saving and succeeding were desirable, the American Dream. Now, according to most liberal publications, such success is scorned and disparaged and those who achieve success are not worthy of their achievements.  They explicitly suggest that hard work, saving and success should not prepare you for life's more difficult moments better than anyone else. That hard work should not grant you any advantage. This view expressed here and in almost every economic article in the NYT is the polar opposite of everything I believe and  it is hard for me to communicate just how despicable and destructive this viewpoint is. In a world without success, there is only failure. Perhaps this is the world the NYT aspires to."
2021-03-15 20:30:38,"This overstates the weakness of the response back in 2008-10. TARP and the American Recovery Act totalled about $1.6 trillion. While one certainly wouldn't argue that more was needed but it was not negligible and it did rescue the financial system and key areas of the economy like autos and produced the longest continuous period of job and economic growth in US history. 

It also has to be recognized that the nature of the crisis was different. Basically the financial system and individual Americans were over leveraged. This is not the current situation."

Now it looks to me like we're going to start taking care of those, like in this article, left far far behind. Filling loopholes and preventing any more corporate trillion dollar ""relief"" - as the Tax Cut and ""Jobs"" Act bestowed on the vastly unneedy  - is a good starting point."

As result, stock market especially those companies benefited from the economic shutdown, most of them are technology companies hit the all time while the bottom half are struggling to bring food home. Biden new 1.9 trillion-dollar package was passed without discussion of its long term effect on the US overall economy in the future.

2021-03-15 22:50:05,"There are two parts to this, they need to be understood and discussed in different parts of the conversation, and they need different approaches.  The crisis, the economic heart attack that occurred last April needed an emergency response.  This response to the acute condition is easy, satisfying, and effective: pour money on it.

The chronic part, the intolerable inequality of economic diabetes, is a completely different problem.  The response to this chronic condition is hard, painful, and dreary:  diagnose, modify behaviors, provide medication, monitor progress.

We need personal financial management education in our schools from late elementary school at least through high school.  We need to elevate the status of skilled workers and encourage students toward vocational and technical training.  We need to properly frame a four-year undergraduate college education for what it is rather than what it used to be with some hard-nosed information on expected income versus student loan burden.  We need to encourage savings and investment in every possible way.

The government can't fix the chronic problem of inequality and lack of disaster preparedness using the money spigot alone."
2021-03-15 22:51:52,"Broad aid is popular, narrow aid is not. 

One of the Republicans' grievances is that they pay to support themselves and then pay taxes to support the unemployed and those on welfare.  They think people receiving benefits are undeserving and that makes them angry at government.  That idea can apply to all targeted aid programs like Obamacare or aid to families with dependent children or school lunches, etc.

What we have found with the Biden plan is that giving money broadly to 70% or 80% of people is perceived as a benefit that is Reagan like in that it lifts all boats.  People support aid given broadly. 

Broad aid is popular, narrow aid is not. This is the new approach.  Stop targeted aid and provide uniform benefits for all.  

So how could that change things?  How about the Federal Government paying for school breakfast and lunch for all children in all schools.  Boom, no welfare stigma, everyone is equal under the law.  I like that.

Now apply that logic to other aid programs."
2021-03-15 22:53:17,"Pay cheap, ignore a decline in education for job skills, jack up rent and turn everything into a culture war and you get The United States.

Millions of retires on Social Security are facing ruin as rents go up and inflation begins to cut purchasing power. Republicans angry at 'Socialists' say 'No' to everything as if that will make it all go away. The stimulus payments are like candy a cheap thrill. A general feeling the system is rigged will  do much damage as 2022 approaches. The federal debt will not go away and the destitution of millions of workers won't go away either.

2021-03-15 23:59:00,"I can only ask a question, probably key to the economic recovery.  A million or more citizens have been protected from an inability to pay bills and protected against eviction. Yet the protections have not been to forgive the accumulating debt; that is certainly unfair to the landlords and creditors.

So far all I've heard is that the $1.9T aid bill is to cover current expenses, not a backlog of debt.

What happens when that debt comes due? Many of the poor and middle class workers were spending every cent that they earned simply to survive.  People who finally may get their jobs back will be back in the hand to mouth situation that persisted before the pandemic. Where does that extra cash come from to pay off the mountains of debt.

Will there be a tsunami of evictions? Why not? It doesn't look like anyone has thought about it that deeply."

The big problem with many government statistics, not just unemployment, is that the government shouldn't be the source for these statistics given that the government stands to benefit based on the outcome of the numbers.

Inflation, unemployment numbers, etc. should be collected & calculated by a politically independent body that doesn't have a stake in the magnitude of the number, one way or the other.  Only then will we get honest numbers that reflect the real world."

Also, in what world is ""giving"" people money so that they will not rob your home and peddle drugs to your kids to stay fed a ""gift?"" Why do we never speak of ""gifts"" to defense contractors? To Goldman Sachs?"
2021-03-15 19:14:49,"Yes! That’s me!
I worked little jobs, part time, temporary, the whole 22 years I was home raising my one children. And now I am not qualified for the special programs for people who lost their employment because is the pandemic, and I haven’t been able to find anything. Two masters degrees, years of experience, understanding that my skills are rusty so am absolutely willing to take an entry level or part time or minimum wage job... but I never get even the courtesy of a “we received your application”, let alone an interview or a job offer.
There are programs for people coming out of prison. But for me, nothing."

It is the fault of mangers, etc.  It works on paper perfectly, but in reality it is flawed."

2021-03-15 19:51:12,"Many Americans had jobs which could be done by young immigrants.

Well over 300,000 unaccompanied minors requested asylum between 2012 and 2019.  Most do not qualify for asylum, but remain here anyway.  While photos of unaccompanied minors are almost always of young children, only 13% are age 12 and under.  75% of the unaccompanied minors say they are between 15 and 17. 

A PBS Newshour had a segment on 3/8/11 titled “In Guatemala, Family Planning Clashes with Religion, Tradition” said 46 percent of children are stunted.  I wonder if a significant portion of those who claim to be minors are actually older.  And even of those who are actually minors, most of them are here not for asylum, but to work.

 A 2/17 Inter-American Dialogue report titled ""Educational Challenges in Honduras and Consequences for Human Capital and Development"" said the average Honduran, age 15 and above, had a 4th grade education. It also said that Hondurans who have attended school for more years perform poorly on international tests for their grade levels, and that El Salvador and Guatemala have higher rates of illiteracy than Honduras.

Most of the unaccompanied “minors” have poor educational backgrounds.  No researchers seem to be looking at the percentage who, once here, go back to school until they graduate.  It is likely most are here not to attend school, but to work.

These young people are taking jobs which our own citizens need."

The Covid vaccine only reduces the possibility that you will develop a serious illness that might require hospitalization.

The reality is that finding a job -- ANY JOB -- is like fighting the battle of Armageddon every day with absolute zero results or feedback to make you feel like you are at least getting close to a goal.

Unless there is a jobs guarantee where the government hires people without grueling interviews or ""Miss America Pageant"" contestant type questions geared to find out how congenial you are, I know I will never get hired.

That is not to say I would mind getting tested to prove how much smarter I am than the pageant contestants, but that is another story entirely. NO OLDER WOMEN NEED APPLY.

Why won't anyone ever do a story about said women who possess exceptional tech skills who still cannot get hired. What I would like to see are the results of a general computer skills test by age group and an explanation for there is not a single job on this planet for someonewho is literate, knowledgeable, and good with technology?

When the government is giving $300 to $600 more in unemployment benefits who can blame them. No wonder the unemployment rate is staying high.

That is what we need to start to heal and recover as a nation, and not only us but our children, grand children, and great grand children will be better for it. Finally we are seeing a President who understands that the U.S. isn't just a country, we're an idea; and puts that basic belief to work in powerfully progressive ways.

A quarter million Americans are both mentally ill and homeless. Our veterans owe 1.6 trillion in student debt. Approximately 10 percent of active service military families are using SNAP and/or food pantries.

Have we ever thought before that, had we all participated actively in this democracy (we, the people, were supposed to be the government, they the politicians just our 'servants we elect as administrators to do our bidding), how the current odious inequities could have been taken care of, and poverty eliminated long ago? I repeat, had we contributed, and foremost elected real leaders, when due?"
2021-03-13 20:43:09,"It’s good news indeed that government is now being seen once again as a force for good in society. Ever since Reagan uttered those words in 1980 (government is not the solution but the problem) income inequality has grown. While this has occurred for many reasons, including globalization and automation, the lack of active government policies to fight inequality have contributed. 

The one major problem I see on the horizon with massive additional spending is that taxes will need to rise at some point. Biden is already alluding to this for the infrastructure bill. I am not in the camp that says deficits no longer matter. While the return of inflation seems far off, it will happen eventually. Once interest rates rise, financing the deficit will become unaffordable."

2021-03-13 21:16:54,"I would be all for taxing the rich to the extent that such taxes could be collected before the rich flee or successfully find ways to hide their money. Our policy makers need to be realistic about how much they could actually collect.

A better solution is Value Added Tax (VAT) which has long been used in Europe. Sure, it adds to the cost of goods, but it does so regardless of where they were made and whether human or automated labor created them. So offshoring and automation cannot be used to hide from this tax.

In the old days when America was thriving, the prices of all products included a large margin for the labor involved in making those products. May as well add that margin back as a VAT tax and use it to pay the people whose labor has been cheapened or replaced."

2021-03-13 21:36:06,"What changed to energize the fight against poverty is that while Biden won the presidency as the lever needed to oust Trump, Sanders won the battle of ideas. 
Without Sanders unwavering ideas, values and vision, Biden's relief bill would likely have been business as usual.

 A poll released a week ago, by The Economist/YouGov, found that Sanders has a higher favorability rating than Biden: Sanders 10, Biden 8, Harris 5.
There is a real movement for change that could make American society better than its current dumpsterfire status.
There is HOPE!
But please do not fall into the sweet trap of a guaranteed income for families with children.
Despite America's love affair with money, it is not the whole answer to child and generational poverty.

To begin to create some equality of opportunity, we need to intervene in the early lives of families, with
affordable housing for ALL
free healthcare for all, with easily accessible mental healthcare and addiction treatment,
paid parental and sick leave for ALL,
free/affordable QUALITY child care for ALL,
QUALITY early childhood education through grade twelve for ALL,
and then, tuition free continuing public education, trade schools and university, throughout a citizens

In a generation America would have a more thriving, and probably, less violent society."
2021-03-13 20:11:03,"I'm delighted to see new thinking about poverty and applaud the new child payments.  However, I really hope that someone in the Administration is thinking about how to gear up to avoid the check-cashing companies from landing a windfall from these checks.  Living in Chicago for many years, I saw the way that check-cashing companies sucked money out of poor families.  At the time, local banks wouldn't open checking accounts without a $500 deposit, which was far too rich for many families.  We need an immediate effort by responsible banks to offer free checking accounts to poor families.  Let them repost the checks without a high fee, and let them keep the money in a bank rather than in their pockets.  This will help to reduce unfair fees and cut down on theft."

The international Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development predicted Biden's Rescue Act will help the U.S. economy grow at a 6.5 percent rate, the fastest since the 1980s.

Compare Biden's Rescue Plan to Trump's Tax Cuts of 2017 which was mostly a gift  for the wealthy and corporate America at the expense of working- and middle-class families. President Trump’s tax gift will cost $1.9 trillion from 2018 to 2027, according to the Congressional Budget Office (CBO). Large corporations received a massive tax cut, running up federal deficits that had little positive effect on the economy, according to the Congressional Research Service.

 Trump lowered the corporate income tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent, reducing corporate taxes $200 billion a year, or $2 trillion over 10 years. Trump's plan was a gift to wealthy investors and himself and foreign investors who own 40 percent of US stock market. China has $1.5 trillion in U.S. Stocks.  Trump, his wealthy friends and China made out like bandits with your money. Biden's plans are not perfect but they will mostly benefit the average American instead of the wealthy."

Although many Great Society programs aimed at poverty survive today (Medicaid, Foodstamps, Headstart, etc.) , the Vietnam war drained the budget and prevented continued expansion of the Great Society.  I believe Biden should worry more about looming problems, like Yemen, the border and voter suppression and less about selling a program which has already been enacted.

2021-03-14 00:31:44,"Force the middle class to pay for anti-poverty programs that they are not allowed to benefit from will cause the middle class to vote against these programs.

When you write of a “long history of white voters souring on spending they perceive to be targeted to racial minorities,” you need to mention that those middle class white voters usually never benefited from these programs. Aside from racism, there was a pretty good economic reason for white voters to be sour on these programs.

Means testing is a recipe for killing programs. If Biden and the Democrats are smart, they will ensure that most, if not all, Americans benefit from the programs that pay for. Otherwise, prepare for a backlash from the middle class."
2021-03-14 00:41:01,"All this has to be paid for. The question is how.

Cut payments in other areas? Increase taxes? Increase the debt?-- to be paid for by those now young, into middle age?

What will sink this is if some people have more kids to get more payments and with other help (housing subsidies, Medicaid, etc) end up doing better than couples where both work and they can only afford one or two kids.

If this can benefit the middle as well, it will succeed."
2021-03-14 00:42:12,"Yes, couldn’t agree more. 

I recently worked as a caseworker, administering SNAP/food stamps.

There are already too of us.  Overpopulation is harming the environment and hastening climate change.

The human population did not reach a billion until the 1800's.  In the past 221 years, we have multiplied to 7.8 billion.  Every one of us is contributing to climate change.

As the party that recognizes that the climate is changing and that people are hastening the change, Democrats would be hypocritical to pay people to have more children than is necessary to replace them.  One child per person (or 2 per couple) is enough to replace our current population. 

I would support financially helping a parent to raise one child and a couple to raise 2.   It would be bad for the environment and our future, if parents decide to have more children.  To discourage parents from having extra children, we could give them the current allowance of $2,000/child for these extra children instead of the enhanced amount.

If current welfare programs such as food stamps and Medicaid are combined with Biden’s plans to provide free child care and government subsidized housing for every poor family, then enhanced allowances for every child would encourage many poor parents to have more children.  We must be careful to limit the enhanced payments to what the natural environment can support."

It is hard to be hopeful in a nation that seems determined to foster divisiveness and wallow in the hatred it engenders.  There is indeed no real sense of community in America.  We have so elevated the concept of individualism that it is almost dangerous to express empathy and caring any longer.

It recognizes that the barriers to opportunity  are not framed by political party, but by the needs and rights of everyone to share in the promise of America.

The Democratic Party has always tried to be a big tent which included everyone.  And now with this vast inclusive program really many programs Democrats will become that vision.

2021-03-14 03:40:27,"The goal of conservatives and liberals overlaps in that both want to retire the kinds of economic expansion that abruptly stopped in the mid-1970’s. The conservatives insist that markets and capital should be free to act without government interference so that the economy can come roaring back. The liberals insist that government should spend public funds on public business to pump the economy back into expansion. Conservatives believe that supporting people who are unable to support themselves is counterproductive. People supported have no need to work and the money which could go into investments in expanding businesses is wasted.  The liberals insist that there is a moral imperative to help those who need it and that general prosperity contributes to economic expansion. 

The conservative policies were accelerated and reducing public support came to be seen as a counterproductive activity. The attempt to rely upon capital and less interference of businesses was undertaken. The wealthy took far more of the new wealth than all others and the overall result was indebted government and most people gaining a far smaller share of new wealth, and fewer opportunities for investors to invest in domestic economic expansion. Do the conservative strategy did not serve the country but greatly served the wealthy."

Look at what they did last year when the benefits added to the normal unemployment checks ran out.  They sat on their hands and refused to do anything to help the citizens they claim to care about.  Why?  Because most of them aren't rich, don't have lobbyists in DC to speak for them, and because they prefer poor Americans who have no energy to object to GOP plans to ditch the social safety net completely despite the damage it would do.  

Every unemployed person I've encountered has wanted to work.  They've searched actively for jobs, reapplied where they'd been turned down, applied for jobs they weren't qualified for, and been willing to take minimum wage jobs just to have some money coming in.  They didn't regard unemployment benefits as a hammock to rest in.  Only the wealthiest can do that.  

There's something peculiar in American society that leaves us hesitant to create programs that do a decent job of helping people.  Part of that is the legacy of slavery.  Every program created after slavery was meant to help white people.  Even social security excluded the jobs most Blacks had at that time.  Why?  Racism.  And racism is behind the GOPs rhetoric to keep the social safety net as  skimpy as it is.  

This past year has shown us that all of us, no matter what our skin color is, need a REAL social safety net."

When the IMF pushed austerity down countries’ throats, it lost the vast majority of its influence. When the EU forced it upon member states after 2008, it lost the GDP equivalent of the Spanish economy and led eventually to Brexit and the rise of authoritarian regimes in the region. And finally, when the US failed to go big enough in its   2008 stimulus and later budget sequestration episodes, it prevented the economy from recovering like it should have, leading eventually to where we are today; an insanely unequal society that has just barely survived a bout with authoritarianism."

Human rights accrue to us all as our civilization becomes more sophisticated and productive.  It's time to declare that food security is a birthright of all Americans.

In the same way that the federal gov't issues social security cards, the gov't should issue a food security card with a monthly credit limit of, say, $200 to every American.  It doesn't matter if you're unemployed or Jeff Bezos.  You would be entitled to spend up to $200 per month on groceries at any supermarket in America.  No more sitting in a queue of cars a mile long to collect a box of free food.  And no more going hungry.

These food purchases would be treated by the IRS as income.  If you make a lot of money but insist on using your food security card, the IRS will know where to find you and you're going to have to reimburse the gov't when you pay your income taxes.  But if your income falls below a certain threshold, then your groceries are on the house.

It is good healthcare has been made more available.  And foreclosure forbearance is critical.  But many will not qualify for assistance because they have managed to keep current or relatively current with rent or mortgage payments but have fallen far behind on real estate taxes.

Dems can simply ditch the filibuster and do what’s popular, then watch the Republicans squirm while trying to explain their votes against very popular ideas. Now that Democrats have had a taste of success, let’s hope they ditch the filibuster, whether by reform or abolition, and become aggressive legislators with the creed, “Help people, do what is already popular, and ignore Republican whining.” Oh how transformational that would be!"

So far there is no indication from the electorate that they want the country to move sharply to the left of center. This is quite contrary to what the authors of this article are suggesting,"

Because there isn't! And Americans have had plenty of time to sit and think about it during the last year. 

What is the middle class anymore? We aren't building capital, that's for sure – we're drowning in debt. Most of us who own houses and new vehicles don't actually own them at all; we're buying them on ""lay-away"" and splitting our paychecks between two or three different banks and loan services each month.

Of course this idea of ""big government"" is anathema to Republicans, who nevertheless were delighted to give a $1.8 trillion or so tax cut  to the wealthy in 2018.

Housing the homeless, who are denied the basic human right of shelter, is possible.  A Green New Deal, which seeks to slow down or stop the undeniable affects of climate change (97 percent of climate scientists worldwide agree that climate change is real and driven by human activity), is possible.  Universal health care, which is our best chance at stopping run away medical spending (The government controls the prices through negotiation and regulation) and ensuring that the public is healthy, is possible.  If we start with these policies, we will prove to the nation and the world that we live up to the ideals of our declaration of independence:  ""We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men (people) are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness."""

The Republicans traditionally offer balance and imbalance in the capitalism direction and the Democrats offer the same in the government direction. So where is the balance? 

Finding the balance is a constant struggle that only works if at least the majority of those who agree and disagree on policy, share the same belief of country over party. The Republicans used to be a part of this balance but no more. They belong to the self perpetuating gaslight culture now. They have managed to balloon the deficit and watch the infrastructure crumble while bellyaching about Mr. and Mrs. Potato Head's changing identity in the toy world. 

Lest we forget the Republicans took a balanced budget and replaced it with the war in Iraq and the financial crisis of 2008. Then they mishandled the pandemic so that although the US has 5% of the world's population, we have over 20% of the deaths.

Same with capitalism. 

Government is that control. It is the only way to assure that capitalism is used for good and not the evil that is caused by  rapacious greed.

I’m not sure what’s to be done about it. The structural advantage Republicans enjoy consists not so much in the Electoral College or Senate outweighing progressive coastal voters as in the fact that the minority of voters they do command include those who will have to pay for any comprehensive social welfare program, and this is a permanent factor in the equation. It won’t go away even if we abolish geographic representation altogether. It seems nationalizing income support, healthcare and housing depends on wartime conditions or rapid economic growth, the backgrounds in front of which the measures passed in Europe—they had Communism breathing down their necks.

Therefore, I fully support these stimulus payments and hope they will dramatically reduce child poverty.  But I have my doubts.  Some of the recent articles in the Times describing people struggling to pay rent or buy food and other necessities have as examples a 39 year old mother of 6 and grandmother of 1, or a 19 year old mother of 2. There needs to be cultural changes so that unwed teenagers with little education and no job skills are encouraged to stop having babies they cannot afford and fathers are encouraged to stay with their children.  Parents reading to their babies before they are old enough for nursery school or Pre-k is what nurtures the development of  babies' curiosity and the growth of their brains.  A single teenage mother cannot reasonably be expected to provide that stimulus to her newborn.

I grew up poor, but became a successful lawyer and am about to retire at 70.  My college educated wife and I were able to nurture our three sons and they are  now all successful.  If we had 6 kids, or if my wife had to raise the kids herself, it would have been far more difficult."

Oh, sure , it will feel like a boom later this year and next as the vaccines take hold and the Economy reawakens post-covid but that will be analogous to a terminally ill patient having a burst of energy on the odd good day......prognosis doesn’t change.

Social Security has lost over thirty percent of it's purchasing power since 2000 and this must be addressed.  That being said, every month when we receive our benefits I thank FDR and the Democrats because without this modest income we would be sheltering under a bridge somewhere.

I feel the same about Medicare.  Yes, the deductibles, monthly premiums and copays are hard on us; but like Social Security, every month I thank LBJ and the Democrats because without this program we would be bankrupt.  We had to use COBRA twice for a total of less than two years.  We paid out nearly $24,000 in premiums to stay covered.  Now; in our retirement, I think of how helpful having that $24,000 in our modest savings account to supplement our income would be.

 We both worked hard for fifty years and the replacement of the defined pension plans with 401Ks was a huge hit for workers. Today's 401K plans have a median annual contribution of $7,200 (keep in mind, that means half of working people are putting less than this away) and 25% of workers not participating at all.

We, the working middle class were once a majority. President Biden is correct for he now:
 ""has blurred the lines between the poor and the middle class, treating them less as distinct groups with separate problems than as overlapping and shifting populations of people who were struggling with economic insecurity even before the pandemic."" 
 
Yes,  many of us are now experiencing the financial insecurities of those that have lived in poverty far too long.    We the People, are the working gears that are needed to bring all products and services from paper to fruition to market.

Others will reflexively point to modern Europe, but that only reinforces by assertion.  In modern Europe, to  finance their welfare state, EVERY working person pays over 50% of their income in taxes, EVERYONE.   And they as a society except this (via elections) as a cost of the government they want.   If you do not believe this, pick your model country and Wiki their taxation rates and system.   There are always three significant taxes for ALL workers.  1. An income tax, that starts at very low earnings (unlike current America), and at median income levels the top rate or very near the top rate is paid (totally unlike America).  2  An employer withheld and paid Social Tax, which is typically 25% or more, 3.  A VAT tax on every euro spent of at least 15%.    Thus if you make even just $10.000 euros a year, you pay $5,000 in taxes.   If you make 70,000 euro, you will pay close to 40,000 in taxes.

I can tell you as a millennial, no one is expecting a free ride. But many MANY of my peers did everything that we were told- we got good grades, went to college and were left in 2007 with no job market. We never recovered. We were left with staggering student loans that often our boomer parent encouraged. We finally got our footing, maybe we’re able to get a job, no guarantee that it would pay enough for a life (a house, a family, health insurance). Keep in mind I am not talking about fast food employees (though work is work) I’m talking about people with masters degrees working as law clerks and admissions officers at wealthy institutions who have no sick time or benefits and are paid $15/hr. 

Perhaps had we not had our Starbucks and avocado toast we would have a country that would care for its sick, it’s poor, it’s hungry? Its the handouts that are the problem? It’s funny as people spout off on trillion dollar debt they forget that tax cuts for the oligarchs that bought our democracy actually got us here. 

Trickle down economics don’t work. Millennials were handed those participation trophies and not much else. Power to the hardworking young people who will take this country forward not to the corporations that run it now. 

To all the people who want to deem this a handout- it’s about time the government did something for US. They work for US. People have forgotten this democracy is FOR THE PEOPLE."

2021-03-14 13:23:54,"Thanks for this excellent report. The New York Times at its best.

As sorely needed as the Biden Stimulus plan is, you cannot call it “progressive.” Until permanent social and economic policies are enacted to remedy structural social and economic inequality, it is simply another bailout.

We have an economic divide that mirrors the class divide: as social poverty grows, so do massive pools of hoarded, untaxed individual and corporate wealth. The Biden Bailout has already ballooned this wealth even further in the markets, before the checks have not even been mailed out. Long after the stimulus has fizzled and people are again broke, this hoarded wealth will only continue to compound, just as it has since the Obama bailout of the banks.

We need Medicare for all, free state universities, and big investments in our nearly third-world infrastructure. Until we increase corporate taxes (especially on the big tech companies who literally vacuum money from society while giving virtually nothing back to anyone but their shareholders), tax the largest private university and church endowments like the corporations that they truly are, and add hefty estate and capital gains taxes on individual wealth... well...

We’ve watched the last four years in horror, so I think we already know what to expect."

That is why the US does not have mandated paid family leave, paid sick leave, paid vacation, pre-k, universal healthcare, subsidized childcare or tuition-free higher education.  The 100% taxpayer funded military gets all those benefits, but not tax payers.

If the only consequence of a global pandemic is to throw some money at people instead of trying to lower the cost of programs and services, it is safe to say that it will not last and if the US hasn't been able to get any fundamental work/life benefits over the past 50 years it is because Americans don't want them -proven by the fact that they vote for people who are opposed to those benefits."

2021-03-14 13:47:15,"America faces many challenges but too many of them are self-inflicted.

Wilkinson and Pickett’s work in “The Spirit Level” finds there is a strong link in developed countries between quality of life measures and how much inequality there is in a given country. The greater the gap between those on top and those on the bottom, the worse everyone does - including those at the top.

We’re talking about things like crime, drug abuse, teen pregnancy, life expectancy, infant mortality, mental health, and more. Since the 1970s the rich have been getting richer and the rest of us have been left behind. 

The GOP war on unions, the social safety net, government itself, coupled with tax cuts for the rich - if America seems broken and divided, the decades-long GOP effort to shove wealth upwards explains much, including the ‘economic uncertainty’ blamed for the rise of Trumpism. 

The long-overdue pushback by Democrats does not come a moment too soon. Keep it up, please! 

They say a rising tide lifts all boats - but it does nothing to help people trade up from rafts to yachts. Efforts to restart the economy are expected to lead to a boom, but it will all be for naught if inequality continues to grow. This is why increased help for families with children in poverty matters. This is why raising the minimum wage and canceling student debt is vital.

All of this threatens the Republican Party’s grip on a base driven by grievance and resentment.

Instead, we are talking about paying people to have children.

When something totally irrational like this is happening, and you can't see the motivator, it's generally money. That's what's going on here.

They were above 90%. So, how could a company still under the control of its founder, like Ford Motor Company, be so successful at that time? Well, back then, those rich executives did not take even 10% of the corporate earnings unlike so many today and the corporations would simply reinvest in themselves to a greater degree than they do today. Today some of the rich executives are raking in more each year than Henry Ford took in his entire life while at the same time using their available cash not only to increase their personal wealth but to buy back stock where they could realize even more power and control. Most business executives today care far less about this nation than their predecessors ever cared, and you wonder why the distances between the well off and those at the lower rungs of the economic ladder are growing?

Populist leaders like  Trump and other Republicans are simply hypocrites  and people are put into deep sleep through obfuscation and lies. First issue is the minimum wage. By keeping the jobs low wage, we have ensured that a large number will remain in perpetual poverty. Providing governmental assistance, we are really subsidizing the employer's payroll. Second issue is the health care. Affordable Care Act helped to tackle it, though Republicans want to abolish it. Third issue is our fiscal policies. With the rapid changes in technology and global trade, corporate income is very unequally distributed among a few stockholders and senior executives while workers see increasingly diminished share of the pie. This has fueled the Dow Jones and many are lulled into false euphoria. The last point was the clarion call of Trump who just wanted to see Dow Jones to soar, while people died, evicted and were doomed. Don't expect Mitch, Lindsey to change soon.

And now we’re going to throw in some cash. 

On what level do parents have a responsibility to provide for their own kids? I understand the benefits to me of educating children in my community, but since when did having children become the biggest graft and tax dodge in the country? Especially in times of climate change, which is driven pretty much directly by population size. Shouldn’t I get a benefit for NOT burdening society?

In truth, as born out by history and evidence, a major role of government is to assist those who are in need when they need it.  It is not those with the most wealth who build or care for the less fortunate, they are the ones who have kept to middle and lower classes from getting ahead.  The wealth is actually built by the working class.  Those who have been systematically held back from advancing in society through no fault of their own, but by prejudice and bias, must be assisted to achieve equality.  Those who are unable to work because of illness or other issues must also be aided.  Wonderful experiments are ongoing in this and other countries which demonstrate the effectiveness of giving financial independence and help to those in need actually increase employment.  People want to be able to work and be self sufficient.  They don’t want to be slaves or live in ghettos.  Blaming the unfortunate for their position is not only wrong, but contributes to keeping those individuals in positions of suffering."

This laid the path for supply-side, reward-the-already-successful economics to take over, and it is what gave us Reagan and 40 years of right-wing paradigms.

2021-03-14 15:21:25,First we should get rid of state governments. We don’t need them anymore and in places like California they are bloated so dysfunctional that they are beyond redemption.  This alone would save every person living in California a significant amount of money by not having to pay state income taxes on top of federal.  And taxes on things like gas or goods shouldn’t exist at all because be pay income taxes. I remember a friend from Europe visiting and they were so confused that a price listed on something they buy wasn’t the price when they went to pay for it.
2021-03-14 15:22:15,"The entire scheme of Republican small government took off under Reagan is forever exposed as bankrupt by the pandemic. Another story recently in the NYT highlighted today’s student debt crisis. Another Reagan/Republican innovation to make the 1% richer by state tax cuts, thereby shifting the tuition burden to students. After all, they explained, education is a private good and it should be paid for privately. Inflation didn’t raise tuition rates. It was withdrawal of state tuition support.

We in higher education said then that this is madness. You’ll cripple young people with debt. Geez, that’s precisely what happened. Republicans learned nothing about the public success of the GI Bill after WWII.

Perhaps we can call them the “Better deal” seeing as how Biden frequently says he wants to “build back better.” We are witnessing the end of the Reagan era and it’s ridiculous “trickle down” voodoo economics. It’s long past time that we take the opposite approach and fund the lower and middle classes rather than the wealthy and corporations.

2021-03-14 15:38:07,It is US government policy to keep somewhere around 5% of US workers *officially* on the unemployment rolls.  Add to that the number of workers who are not counted but just as jobless and you have a significant segment of the workforce without a pay check as a result not of their actions but by force of government.  And yet neoliberal policy makers want to add work requirements to any and seemingly all aid available and blame those affected for their poor choices.  Sheesh.
2021-03-14 15:44:03,"What changed to energize the fight against poverty is that while Biden won the presidency as the lever needed to oust Trump, Sanders won the battle of ideas. 
Without Sanders unwavering ideas, values and vision, Biden's relief bill would likely have been business as usual.

 A poll released a week ago, by The Economist/YouGov, found that Sanders has a higher favorability rating than Biden: Sanders 10, Biden 8, Harris 5.
There is a real movement for change that could make American society better than its current dumpsterfire status.
There is HOPE!
But please do not fall into the sweet trap of a guaranteed income for families with children.
Despite America's love affair with money, it is not the whole answer to child and generational poverty.

To begin to create some equality of opportunity, we need to intervene in the early lives of families, with
affordable housing for ALL
free healthcare for all, with easily accessible mental healthcare and addiction treatment,
paid parental and sick leave for ALL,
free/affordable QUALITY child care for ALL,
QUALITY early childhood education through grade twelve for ALL,
and then, tuition free continuing public education, trade schools and university, throughout a citizens
life.
In a generation America would have a more thriving, and probably, less violent society."

The gop cannot hide the good that can come to red states from relief and attempts to lessen poverty in the US.

The greatest expansions in Medicare under the ACA came to states whose republican congressional representatives voted against the bill.

Nothing is perfect but you cannot keep good legislation from seeing the light of day forever."

Let those 10 or more Republican Senators whose votes could be crowbared out of the No column and into the Yes column take credit for that modest shift toward helping low wage workers, and let the Dems take credit for acting bipartisan. Win-win, right? Worth a try?"
2021-03-14 15:55:17,"The article mentions the expansion of healthcare in the COVID bill.  It's an ACA fix -- but note that it is only one of many badly needed fixes, and is only for 2 years at the moment.

Let's not kid ourselves: the Democrats lack both sufficient power and will to fix the rest of the problems at the moment, and who knows what the future will bring.

That temporary fix  was the two year removal of the 400% of Fed. Pov. Lev. (FPL) ""subsidy cliff.""

That was a really serious affordability problem.  A recent Times Upshot graphic (or alternatively healthcare.gov) shows that some people just over that cliff are saving $1,000 a month per person on premium because of the premium reduction to 8.5% of income.

If you do the math and look up the FPL cutpoints, it means some people over the cliff before were paying 28% of income (most extreme case 50%) for ACA premiums.  They now pay, for 2 years, just 8.5%.
 
The ""subsidy cliff"" fix is temporary only. 

And there are other problems, like out-of-pocket maxes commonly $7000 a person / $14,000 a family, which is unaffordable for many.

And, in about 12 states (including blue MA, NJ, MD), people 55-64 under 138% FPL get no insurance--just a loan, until death, for medical expenses, due to the state-chosen Medicaid estate recovery policy to recover on on ACA expanded Medicaid.

That's a lot of things.  Let's hope for the miracle that Dems can get done.

(On the latter issue, see the Wikipedia article on Medicaid estate recovery and its refs.)"
2021-03-14 15:57:56,"Nowhere in this otherwise excellent and accurate piece is the actual problem described: Our obscene and out-of-control wealth (not income) concentration.

Various scholars (such as Lazlo Baribasi) have articulated the mathematics that drive this -- an unregulated wealth network (such as an economy) will ALWAYS evolve to a ""scale-free"" node distribution. In plain English, a handful of people will have enormous wealth while an enormous number of people will have but a handful of wealth.

This is MUCH more pronounced than the pretty and familiar ""normal"" probability distributions that almost always accompany attempts to popularize these concepts.

The GOP dogma that an unregulated free market is the most fair way to distribute wealth -- especially newly created wealth -- is anathema to a nation that alleges to value human life and seek to end unnecessary human suffering.

We have taken the very first baby steps of a long and arduous journey out of the wilderness of the draconian dystopia that actually results from the voodoo economics of Ronald Reagan -- and virtually every Republican since."

The traditional Democratic Party concentrating on quality of life issues that effect all Americans, the Party of progressive social domestic policy. An agenda the Democrats operationally relinquished after its years of activity and constructive accomplishment with the 1960s Johnson administration. 

The detoured road the Democratic Party traveled exemplified by the Clinton administration. When legislation was passed that restructured government assistance for impoverished parent and dependent child with the 1996 passage of Temporary Aid For Needy Families, TANF, which replaced Aid To Families With Dependent Children, AFDC. This new legislation TANF signified by stringent rules and a stressful process centered around an aid recipient finding a job. While at the same time rewarding employers of TANF recipients with tax breaks. A demonstration of an operational system where those that need the most get the least."

The holes in healthcare, education and infrastructure are problems, but the real big bogey of them all is the huge disparity of income, wealth and (because of these) opportunity. Our previous lack of attention to this came back to savage us in the form of Donald Trump -- although, he was just a bad captain of a ship already taking water. 

We do have to pay for this new social platform however, if we wish it to remain in place. The setting now may be perfect for that evil pair of capitalism and socialism to be stripped of animosities and take to the dance floor. A real loving embrace, where the partners perform their roles unhindered by the other and move in harmony to sweep the floor. A deal, if you like, between letting loose on unprecedented trade in exchange for a solid economic platform for ALL Americans to do their best. Where extraordinary profits, through the liberalization of markets, are invested in the enormous quantities of untapped talent to provide the next round of prosperity -- and perhaps, a happier nation.

Now we have a ""universal child income"" program for working families, more affordable healthcare and other programs to make life a bit easier for families at the lower end of the income scale.  Perhaps, at last, the US will join the rest of the developed world in creating a strong and comprehensive safety net and services for human needs.  There's still a lot that needs to be enacted: child care subsidies, tuition-free higher education, guaranteed healthcare for all, better options for seniors.

If we don't get those things, I don't see the point, because we're spending $1.45 trillion over the $500 billion that economists agree is the damage done by Covid-19 to the economy."

1-That when the ten words: ""I'm from the government, and I'm NOT here to help"" are national credo— taxes do not go down, only services are cut, and benefits flow to the pathologically greedy and corporations.
2- NOT throwing money at problems also does not seem to solve them, and in fact may make them worse.
3-The dangers of the deficit, overheating the economy, and inflation, apply only when the incomes of the poor and middle class rise, and not when we give trillions to businesses in tax breaks, holidays, subsidies and decreased regulations, and not when CEO salaries rise to such levels that take us to the brink of seeing the world's first trillionaire."

Without e-verify, Biden is not doing enough to protect jobs, better wages and benefits for America's poor. 

Absent e-verify, the expanding underground economy remains unchecked, as higher wages displace more Americans for undocumented workers. 

End result:  America's poor remain, poor, while the country absorbs ever increasing numbers of unskilled migrants to create more poverty and an expanding underclass. 

It's almost like he's doing it intentionally, as he surely is savvy enough to understand that increasing minimum wage levels without e-verify.

While those efforts of the Clinton era to ""End Welfare"" brought some valuable initiatives, especially at both community (CDFI) and individual levels (or ""small groups"" via micro credit), it was the War on Poverty of Kennedy and LBJ which seriously proposed an end to welfare as it focused specifically upon the poor and poor communities through directly funding the poor and, especially, launching efforts at control of their communities in the Community Action Program.  It is still widely misunderstood as having been the exact opposite of what it was."

Does it take 30 years to figure out that the ClintonGingrich economic programs Made China great again and the average American worker poorer?

Welfare to work was named aptly, education was removed as an option. The policy literally removes any possibility of obtaining the American dream and creates a whole subclass of indentured servants. It works exceptionally well at keeping women and people of color down."

The billions for rental assistance  is about bailing out the landlords, the real estate crowd, and other Washington connected groups.  The same can be said for most of the stimulus money --- the $110B in tax credits for children provides only an additional $1000 or $1600 bucks a year per child ---  In the meantime, low interest rates allow Wall Street and new SPAC/IPO Ponzi schemes to coin new billionaires in that amount in matter of months.  

What’s going to happen when the stimulus funds dries up… The day of reckoning will appear.  Hopefully, someone in government will realize the printing money inevitably ends up in the coffers of the rich and connected in America and return to the tax rates of the Roosevelt administration."

Taxes are a negative connotation indicating a burden, so in instead of calling it the ""Internal Revenue Service"" it should be  the ""American Investment Fund"".  If there is one thing Americans respond to,  IS their Americaness.  Millions of people are convinced to pay into Ponzi  schemes and casino type investments through employers, why not a  reasonable investment for a reasonable return on your money with a plan for everyone? Andrew Yang was the only candidate that thought out of the box on many of these subjects, but even in 2020, he was pushed aside as ""unrealistic"".  Well, a Democratic Republic in 1789 was also  an unrealistic idea to the people of the world, let alone Colonials. That's  WHY they called it ""The New World"" for so long. It only became ""let's go to America after the Civil War.  We are far removed from the 19th century and honestly, at 69,  I already feel removed from the 20th century.  I only warn that ""conservatives' would keep America years behind the time  it's actually in if you let them. Don't.

No, that's highly unlikely. The Tea Party came about because Obama was black. It was about race, using the economy as a cover story.

Especially, since -
a) They're often prompted by ""paying back"" for votes; and
b) They often have a nasty aftertaste - i.e., the smallish number of even occasionally independent voters pushing back BIGTIME 2 years after a Presidential election.

Obviously, I think both apply to this.... Yes, it's a nasty era in which the very wealthy - some of them ARE charitable - are ""killing it,"" while almost everyone else is either being killed or - at best - treading water.

But ""doing an end around"" - we won't raise taxes in too visible a way, but we'll tweak costs & benefits of Federal spending & taxation is like teeing up the ball for Republican Congresspeople wannabes. I hardly have to tell anyone that millions of white voters got lost because they ""misunderstood"" many Dem. planks.

Politicians are held in low esteem by many, but 95% of the population revile the single mothers with many kids. PhD's can write about how irrational it is to think in terms of ""my benefits will increase,"" but voters go ballistic when they think that they're paying $20/month to people who have kids they can't afford and/or raise properly.

Again, I recognize that those same people (AND I) may be paying $200/month to benefit underserving rich people, but I KNOW which one might tip Congress control in 2022."

My father lost everything in the great depression and my mother, whose father abandoned his family, lived in fear waiting for the next stone to fall upon them. My father worked hard, but his earning were meager and the welfare checks allowed them to pretend they were not poor. The checks were paid for by their fear of discovery. We celebrate the idle rich, condemn the idle poor and are taught to lust after what George Carlin perfectly described as ""stuff"". Perhaps the pandemic has taught at least a few that ""time and chance happeneth to us all"",  but a lot more to some than others."

It hates spending money on the poor but sees lots of working class people buying some of its message and is not sure what to do. Reaganism had an ideological appeal to it but has been unpicked by the inconsistency between a small state and its flag-waving.

Reagan's cruelty in implementing Social Security's 1983 Windfall Elimination Provision and inability for most Student Loan debt to be discharged like most other debt, has haunted several generations of Americans. Reagan's 1988 Anti-Drug Abuse Act and the 1998 Drug-Free Student Loan Provision - signed by Clinton ensured that even misdemeanor drug convictions prohibited  individuals from numerous student aid resources;last year Congress finally revoked that provision. Now,  Congress must also work to end the WEP devastating millions of low-wage workers who worked under nominal public pensions and Social Security. House Republicans and Democrats have tried since 2015 to get a bill passed but the Senate hasn't budged.

Democrats fortunately have little choice now. They could go all out Trumpist and Victim Blame or work to stop the hemorrhaging and to heal the patient by eliminating and changing laws and regulations that brought us to this point.

I'd like to think they'd do this out of moral and ethical considerations combined with our economic necessity, and perhaps there is a flavor of that.

At its core there are still people in this country who believe they are superior to others based on race and are allowed to tell their truth as voters and as government officials who serve locally and nationally.  With all our laws and this constitution the powerful still answer to no one.  The disparities in housing and health care are much deeper and vast then anyone could have imagined.

2021-03-12 14:10:06,"According to a phrase reputedly coined by Mark Twain, ""History doesn't repeat itself but it often rhymes.""

It was rather disheartening to see our country repeat the same mistakes we made during the 1918 pandemic and worse yet, once the nature of what we were dealing with was clear to anyone who cared to see, actually doubling down on these mistakes.  

Here are some of the lessons I hope that we've learned from this disaster.  

Spending a large part of our national wealth, far more than any nation on earth, on ""defense"" did not keep us from being brought low by a microbe any more than it prevented Americans from dying at the hands of a small group of religious fanatics armed with boxcutters.  We need to broaden our vision as to what constitutes a threat and be more prepared.

Globalization and outsourcing production may have made some already rich people even richer (and a  whole bunch of Americans much poorer) but when the entire world is scrambling to buy, say, medical grade masks, it might be a good idea to have these essential supplies manufactured here.

When scary things are happening, it is better to level with the people.  Phony optimism, sugar coating and outright denial of the reality that people are living is not a good strategy.  It can also turn a once high riding president into ""Former Guy"".

Finally, we need to get back to the idea that government matters.  Competence matters.  Experience matters.  Let's hope we remember that in the future."

Similar to FDR. He did not cure the depression but he tried and gave millions of people hope and support until WW2 ended it."

That was a lie fostered by Reagan, his aides and abetters, and the many acolytes that followed. As someone who has worked as both an employee of the federal government and for for-profit companies, neither has a lock on good, efficient, humane performance, and both have a share of incompetents, time-servers, and self-servers. Any sanctimonious claims of inherent moral superiority of one or the other deserve our universal derisive laughter. Each has a place where fit-for-purpose, and both deserve the regular, critical scrutiny of us all to ensure the public welfare."

Without the government’s support, more people would have been unable to eat. 
Without the government’s support, we would never have begun to recover from last year’s devastation. 

The GOP will never learn this lesson, nor do they care to. Representative McCarthy went so far as to call the American Recovery Act a wish list for liberals that doesn’t help the American people. 

Really?

He’ll pass a bill that gives two trillion dollars to millionaires, billionaires and corporations without blinking an eye, but won’t help Americans suffering from the pandemic three hundred dollars a week.

When we stake our ""reality"" with ""non-reality"" the funhouse effect become the norm; the glass walked into is unseen, dangerous; our head bump reminding us all too painfully of our inadequate perceptual apparatus. Children learn the sun rises and sets as if that were normal! (For those who don't know, our planet spins and our planet revolves around the sun which doesn't move as taught.) But in this example we see: A) accepted norms (incl. repeated fallacies) are easily swallowed and perceived and B) challenging norms may be appropriate when the challenge is driven by facts, logic and compassion. The US COVID-19 pandemic has shaken us to these concerns and realizations. The deniers will continue promoting untrue gospel, and evade any attempt at becoming informed because of adherence to past myths. That cannot be changed easily. What CAN be changed is what we are doing now—a pro-active stance making assistance available with a projected timetable encouraging welfare of the populace. I am open to thinking of life w/o the virus."
2021-03-12 13:24:07,It is difficult to imagine anything worse than the job Trump did handling the pandemic over the past year.  It makes Biden look absolutely brilliant over the last two months.
2021-03-12 12:59:32,"I voted for Trump.  Twice.  And I will flat-out own that President Biden is a MUCH BETTER leader in the effort against the pandemic.  But NOT because he put in place any particular details or tactics or strategies against the pandemic--for most of those were already in place--but because he is warm and caring, and the American people needed that.  

Trump couldn't keep his mouth shut.  If Fauci said something, Trump had to jumble it all up with reiterating it incorrectly or throwing out something he heard anecdotally, or acting as if it was no big deal.

Now, I ""get"" that in the latter matter (hey!), Trump was trying to inspire calm and provide assurances.  But he wasn't really doing that by acting like it was as insignificant as a cold.  

In retrospect, I don't think it much mattered what way we handled COVID-19.  Whether a state locked down or didn't, it didn't seem make much difference:  COVID was coming, it was going to take some people, and that was that.

At the same time, though, Trump (even if only for reelection purposes) did understand that a national lockdown might have made it such that, even if fully effective, might have had the terrible consequence of having us reemerge to an utterly broken economy.  For Trump, I think part of the issue was that he didn't want an ""out of the frying pan, into the fire"" future.  

But kudos for Biden for following through and, most importantly, exhibiting the warm, calm, caring leadership that was missing with Trump."
2021-03-12 12:21:59,"I am so grateful for President Biden and his team. Let’s understand that the world was in a race for the vaccine so don’t overplay Trumps involvement.

Unfortunately some of my relatives are still Neanderthal and give the vindictive former guy more credit than he deserves.

We can begin by eliminating labels. We should not be referred to as Irish Americans, Cuban Americans, African Americans, etc. Rather, we are AMERICANS, of Irish decent, Cuban decent, African decent.

Framing it as a ""both sides"" issue perpetuates this problem.  There is truth, and there is falsehood.  The part of this country that believed the lies, and the leaders and media outlets that perpetuated falsehoods, are responsible in large part for the loss of life.

We put people who had coronavirus into nursing homes 
We traveled during our holidays spreading it far and wide 
We made wearing masks political
   And so many more mistakes. But even now , even with 520,000 dead in one years to a totally containable virus ( just go ask Japan or Australia if it’s containable) after all that we continue to make tragic mistakes. Trump gets plenty of blame but he’s been out of office for 2 months.
  Biden asked for a national mask mandate, but there are no penalties for not wearing masks, so guess what happened? The people who were not wearing masks continued to not wear them. Masks stop the spread of the virus but they only work perfectly when there is one hundred percent mask compliance, Biden looks feeble and ineffectual here, with people simply ignoring his mandate,
   We gave the shots to retired seniors and left the workforce unprotected. What we did was change the demographics on who is dying, we lowered the age, you will see less 85 year olds dying and more 60 year olds. People between 50 and 65 who are in the workforce were put in danger so 80 year olds could see their grandchildren. How sweet.
  People are allowed to travel for spring break, a super spreader , but it’s totally allowed. Japan and Australia would never allow it.
  It’s time to stop blaming the Presidents and blame the people themselves."

There are still people who believe the virus is a hoax, even among those who have had it. There are far too many people who believe mask wearing is an effort by the government to control people instead of save them. There is a huge segment of the population who believes the vaccine will either harm them because it has not been sufficiently investigated or is some plot by the deep state to rewrite our DNA.

It's hard to underestimate the gross negligence such deliberate inaction cost this nation.  But Dr. Fauci is right:  it takes real brass to turn a deadly virus into a political war, and mask wearing a symbol of our endless divisions.

Recognizing people only by their eyes and body stature.  Worrying about elderly widowed neighbors. Busy mailman deliveries, numbers never before visited.  Scurrying through store to get groceries - the only outing.  Cancelled theater tickets lying on a dresser.  Pets who have not seen visitors entering the house, for months.

The only thing they were worried about was their political future.  And, unbelievably, they continue to value power over Nation.  The price has been over a half-million dead.  More to come, with the loyal governors and legislatures busy trying to suppress the vote in the next primaries,  and , worse, ignoring all precautions issued by the CDC to head off another surge.

Are we a nation guided by a guise of a constitution which is nothing but  a worthless paper document to many poor and underserved communities? Is this the nation where the greatest generation would still proud of?

NYT, you really need to step up your game.  You seem to be analyzing the coronavirus pandemic in a knowledge vacuum.  In 1918, when the influenza virus was spreading in the U.S., President Woodrow Wilson made the command decision to completely stifle the press on this subject because we were at war with Germany, and Wilson did not want to compromise our war effort by letting Germany know the extent to which our troops were being horribly impacted by the pathogen. 

John M. Barry's brilliant 2009 book, ""The Great Influenza,"" should be required reading for your reporters and editors working on coronavirus articles and opinions.  The book is essential for putting today's coronavirus pandemic in proper perspective.  It clearly explains how viral pathogens work, and demonstrates convincingly that the U.S. knew, or should have known, how to prepare for the 2020-2021 pandemic."

The goal of Operation Warp Speed was to make Trump look good for the 2020 election.  Once he lost, the air went out of its balloon.  Operation Warp Speed was a profile in incompetence, not least because it put incompetent people at its head, utterly failed to adequately address the critical issue of vaccine distribution, and failed to purchase a sufficient number of vaccine doses to cover the U.S. population.

Hillary would have put Obama in charge of the worlds pandemic response.

The Hillary WH would be in communication with countries like Japan and South Korea, countries that had dealt with a coronavirus before. The US would begin to make the tests necessary to test for coronavirus.

When the coronavirus hit, the WH would immediately tackle the problem looking to contain the virus, stopping flights in and out of the city affected.

Hillary would take the steps that Japan was taking at the very same time. Locking down the city or state involved, urging all Americans to wear a mask and being honest with the American people. 

Hillary would start her second term by commemorating the 30,000 dead due to coronavirus and urging all Americans to be vaccinated and would be leading the world in the effort to eradicate the virus.

So the easiest thing to do is compare the United States with Japan since both have a similar form of government and are technically sophisticated.

Everyone in Japan wears a face mask and woe to anyone who doesn’t, someone walking around without a face mask in Japan would be considered a murderer and might be attacked. In the United States you can to this very day walk down the streets of fifth ave without a face mask, nobody will bother you, not even the police, you could have a serious cough and could be actively spreading coronavirus and nobody will stop you. This in itself is the number one reason we have 70 times the deaths of Japan, this lax policing or self policing. 

Japan also restricted all inbound travel into their country, and if you return from abroad you must quarantine, break a quarantine and the consequences are dire.

The tragic fact is at least 480,000 Americans died and just a few simple proactive steps would have saved them. It’s not just sad, it’s criminal."

2021-03-12 15:35:48,"The difference between the former president and the current one could not be more unambiguous. Trump was motivated by self aggrandizement. This lead him to lie and obfuscate and ultimately to throw away the opportunity to show leadership in a time of crisis. You can't get blood from a stone, as they say, and you can't get compassion from a Trump. And the irony is that this tragic personality flaw lead directly to a golden opportunity for his successor. Trump's titanic failure was ultimately an underhanded toss right over the plate for president Biden. And naturally, Joe knocked it out of the park. I wish the price had not been so terribly high, but am I ever glad to have real leadership back in the White House."
2021-03-12 14:39:28,"About Operation Warp Speed....it should always be remembered that other countries developed vaccines just as fast (or faster than we did); they did so largely without the massive devastation we saw here (although we did see plenty of mini-trumps like Bolsinaro and Boris the Blonde destroy their countries with their donald-like denialism and incompetence); and although we like to call it the ""Pfizer"" vaccine its actually the BioNtech vaccine.

The best way to get re-elected is to get rid of the filibuster (the Ds rarely use it) and allow the average citizen to get the governmental help s/he needs, like strengthening union rights, raising the minimum wage, stopping the Republican (party of the working class) efforts to restrict voting and toughening the anti-pollution laws."

He was and is incompetent to lead; his bullying and bluster are mistaken for strength, and his handling of the pandemic will be remembered for its politicizing a disease, blaming others, and lack of empathy.

We watched him turn wearing a mask, the very simplest thing we could do, into a political issue.  We saw our wealth care system overwhelmed by the cases and we watched as people died because of a lack of access to medical care, the lack of coordination, and the non-existent cooperation from the federal government because Trump said that Cvoid-19 would one day ""poof, vanish"".  

We heard Jared Kushner say that the national stockpile was for the federal government not the states.  In short we witnessed a melt down of our government and then a complete absence after the 2020 presidential election.  If the task was destruction of America yes, we rose to it through our ex-president and his sycophants.  We rose to it with the lack of readiness on January 6, 2021.  The GOP is still rising to the challenge of destroying America for all but the richest.  

All in all, the Trump presidency rose quite well to the occasion of ruining America for 99% of its citizenry.  Let's hope that Biden can persuade us that government of, by, and for the people is still possible."

2021-03-12 16:25:54,"‘President Donald J. Trump lost his job in large part for mishandling a crisis he at first denied.’

I don’t know. I think Trump deservedly lost his job because he was an incompetent, misogynistic, racist xenophobe hated by a majority of the population. 

He tried to take away healthcare from tens of millions with no viable replacement. 

He antagonized every Democratic voter and many independents. 

He lied and cheated and colluded at every opportunity. 

He was worse than a national embarrassment. He’s a permanent stain on our international reputation. 

And he did a horrible job at managing the worst pandemic in a hundred years, killing hundreds of thousands of our fellows unnecessarily. 

His last year crystallized almost everything that was reprehensible about his reign of error, simultaneously driving the deepest wedge in our country since the Civil War and nearly destroying our democracy."

Truth matters, facts matter, honesty matters and competency too; Joe has all of these qualities."
2021-03-12 15:15:04,"Last night, I watched and heard our real president, not a demagogue. President Biden spoke with both kindness and strength, and yes, he spoke; he didn’t shout, whine, wheedle or feel sorry for anyone but the victims of The Former Guy’s abdication of his responsibility to get in front of what he knew was happening and chose to ignore. I saw and heard a president of all Americans, even those who won’t acknowledge they have one, even those who didn’t vote for him but many of whom polls show have discovered they like his plans anyway. I heard hope for our nation’s future, based on an understanding of our past and how to use its lessons to make us a better country. I heard the promise of America come back into focus.

Will it be enough? Will the hardcore doubters and objectors scuttle our pandemic recovery for political points as they have been trying to do? Or will they be willing to give this far-more-trustworthy administration a chance? It may be a bitter pill for them to swallow - Democrats did this alone with zero Republican help - but enough seem to be swallowing that pill, at least for now. This bill is a huge start, but it is only a start; more will be needed. But let’s remember this when we get frustrated: it takes an instant to blow things up, as The Former Guy did, but a long time to rebuild. Have patience, faith, and the willingness to work to make it work, and we’ll come out much better on the other side, which is coming into view."

When Biden assumed office, and when all of us learned that absolutely no vaccines were “on the shelf,” the true horror of the Trump Administration sank in.

Never once did I think The Supreme Narcissist would come through...even partially. Trump cares only for himself. Even his family is not important to him. How can such an individual be a public servant?

Been watching “The Crown” on Netflix and it’s fascinating. Edward VIII and Wallis Simpson...unbelievable.

Trump thought it best to hide the approaching pandemic from the public domain because he ""didn't want to create a panic""...How thoughtful of him...Nonsense! He, in realtity, instead elected to dump the problem on the backs of the Governors of the 50 States and, in the process, enabled the virus to consume the country as a whole in a very short period of time. Trump's lifetime aversion to ""work"" spelled real danger. 

Tragically, the result of his laziness, along with his crass disregard for the health and wellbeing of the people he was elected to serve, and the utter stupidity in his mishandling of this crisis resulted in the deaths of over 500,000 American lives in just 1 year! That's more lives lost than than the total combined lives lost in WW1, WW2, and Vietnam (an unpopular war he managed to escape by virtue of his phony ""bone spur""! This pathetic record is Trump's ""legacy"".

The situation in our country disgusts me.  I look to the past at the war effort where the nation came together to beat the enemy.  We need to treat the virus as the enemy.  I know about human kindness.  I live in Houston TX blessed with the most disasters of any city in the US.  Things like the Cajun Navy,  the grass roots efforts of people to try and save others.  Some who died doing this.  The young mom with kids who spent days with no sleep who joined the volunteer effort and fielded calls and dispatched rescuers. 

I have hope that with President Biden we may be able to pull us together.   It is so sad that our state government, who mismanaged our power grid, opened up the state and rescinded the mask order.  Back to business as usual.   So sad"

I have lived like a hermit all year and when in public, hazmat gear. The vaccine is my only hope for some semblance of normalcy and being able to see friends again who are also getting vaccinated.
We do need to do a better job of tracking and isolating those returning from international travel. We should ban all travel to hot spots like Brazil and South Africa, because those virus variants can undermine the effectiveness of the vaccines we currently have."

The nightmare thought of  continued denialism, no federal response would have resulted in a catastrophe  well exceeding the present death count.

More credit, and coverage in the press, should be given to science - without the development of CRISPR gene editing, our death toll from the virus surely would be in the millions.

NIH, a government basic research institution that was directly responsible for the basic science research that allowed new vaccines to be rapidly produced.

Nor the fact that Republican Party refuses to recognize the importance of risky government spending in all the basic sciences that has allowed our country to flourish.  Republican Party refusal to fund basic science research by the FEDERAL government that ALLOWS industry to make profits.   These industrial companies DEPEND on this basic research and that is NOT reported.

I also did not see much said about more American deaths in one year than 8 years of war in WW I, WWII, Korea, and Vietnam COMBINED.  The Republican administration did NOT use the war production act to mobilize private industry.

The shame of the Republican Party was NOT in this piece.

No mention of Republican refusal to vote for Covid-19 relief in March of 2021.

To which I could have replied, thank you, Mr. Trump, for sparing me the anxiety which would have overtaken me had I been forced to face the brutal truth about the Covid-19 and its potentially devastating effects on our citizens.

But I'd also go on to say that I would have been willing to suffer any degree of psychological distress in exchange for the tens of thousands of lives which could have been spared had you been honest about the virus in the first place.

He received treatments unavailable to the public. Extra does of those medications were requested, which he gave to his wife, his family and close associates.  In actuality his only real success as a president was initiating  ""Operation Warp Speed."" To this day he has failed to realize that.  He failed to understand what was happening before his very eyes with the hundreds of thousands of Americans dying.   Instead he focused his attention on every slight, real or perceived. At the end of his presidency he had fired anyone who questioned any of his actions, replacing them with sycophants, who had no problem repeating lies. Donald Trump is not a natural born leader. He has lead a life of privilege, and never been held accountable for his mistakes.  He was so out-of-touch with reality that he couldn't even recognize that ""Operation Warp Speed,"" could have saved him.  Thankfully he did not.  President Biden has done more for the average American in less than 60 days, than Donald Trump did in 4 years.

It is almost jolting when we stop to think of all this nation has been through this past year, more than half a million lives lost to a microscopic enemy, and millions of jobs and livelihoods gone, too.  And in not even 100 days, President Biden has placed us and our democracy on a road  toward full recovery.

Personally and by two degrees of separation I know of a dozen who’ve perished.  To find real meaning in the statistics (which are, after all, merely cold markers of tragedy) I self-challenge to review my own life.  Among the fortunate, I’m healthy, get a monthly pension check, have medical coverage, live in our payed-off home, have terrific kids, young grandchildren who still delight in tumbling on me, etc..  These are the kinds of things numbers don’t talk about - the loss of life as the loss of the “stuff of living.”

I  lost my own very close sister to multiple myeloma this past June.  As I “clean-up” her Estate I’ve become even more aware of the person she was: her extensive music collection - with genres I’d never suspect (like hard rock), videos of her singing at summer adult music camps (attesting to a life filled with song), a collection of joyful miniature wind up toys (think flipping frogs), photo albums of her travels, collection of brass menorahs and most importantly, a collection of over seventy friends (who endowed a bench in her memory at Wave Hill Gardens). All of these painting a picture of a full life well lived.

The real tragedy with Covid is the that so much of the richness, joy and even pathos of life has been lost needlessly. It didn’t have to be like this!"
2021-03-12 18:07:56,"As a nation, we've learned many things about ourselves, from great courage and coping with despair, to the persistent frequency of police violence against Blacks, to the dregs of political chicanery.

Covid was a huge, nasty wound to the body, not a gun shot, but lonely suffering, isolated death, and unrequited grieving. Many will no doubt never fully recover from the thought of those lost.

But we are moving ahead, as we always are, this time with a seasoned, experienced, empathetic leader who knows first hand the many ways in which suffering and loss can bring purpose, focus, and a renewed regard to the plight of others. Perhaps, with luck, we will draw closer over time, and heal.

This, I think, is a big deal.  A very big deal, in the narrative of the American dream."

Amen to that. And victory over the virus depends on it. It depends on whether Republicans can put aside politics and instead pay attention to science and wear masks and get vaccinated.
Biden set a goal of backyard barbecues on the Fourth of July, but whether we reach it remains to be seen. It depends far more on us than it does on him."
2021-03-12 15:34:16,"I am very reluctant to praise the Trump Administration for Operation Warp Speed. It is similar to giving a President credit for nominating a Supreme Court Justice (or3). It is their job and in the latter case a matter of fate.

""We are in this together"" is Biden's message, and the Fauci footnote says that ""all"" means the whole globe.  We must work across borders to quash the pandemic.  We cannot isolate behind closed borders forever, and hope to remain free of rampaging diseases.  We will have to deal with friends and foes alike, our European economic allies and our historic trade nemeses, our anti-terrorist partners and our anti-democracy opponents. Covid and its future descendants do not have national barriers.  The Biden presidency starts on a totally different premise than the Trump presidency. Biden has given me optimism to displace the despair of the covid past."

I like and respect Biden, and voted for him, but in my view his legacy will lie in  his ATTEMPTS to bring the catastrophe to the earliest conclusion possible. 

He can do everything in his power. 

But if Americans assume that vaccinations mean they can engage in reckless behavior, such as mixing freely with unvaccinated family and friends, we may see a downward trend ascend.

Biden will do everything possible to give the country the tools. But as with the mask wars, vaccine wars are not improbable. What will OUR legacy be?

My second dose is tomorrow and I am completely grateful for those scientists who brought this to fruition. I will live more freely but will remain aware that my better status will not mean 100 %."

It leads to vast inequality, waste of human resources, and cripples our response to challenges like the pandemic, climate change, and the destruction of our environment. 

We have a chance to change that, and so far, Joe Biden appears to be the leader we need to make a start."

Covid still has a tight grip on America and beyond. The threat of mutation and variants is real and very dangerous.

Too many of us are still in pandemic denial and disregarding the critical need to not throw needed cautions to the wind.

Beyond all of this America remains profoundly and doggedly divided — the alpha affliction that may well yet destroy our prosperity and our democracy."

Yes, President Trump early-on denied the magnitude of the covid epidemic, but so did his top science advisor, Dr. Fauci, who pooh-poohed the covid-19 threat and declared a year ago that ""[t]here's no reason to be walking around with a mask."" 

Presidents get too much blame, and too much credit, for outcomes largely out of their control.  

Trump's CDC did mess up the initial testing rollout, but he then put together a startlingly successful vaccine development program on a scale not seen since the New Deal.  Trillions of federal dollars flowed to Americans through bipartisan measures, and the Fed kept the economy simmering.

Biden's vaccine rollout has also been fraught with confusion and delays, but is now gaining steam, and he should be credited with keeping his foot on the gas.  Let's wait to see how successful this latest partisan stimulus package is before we hand out any laurels."

He certainly mentioned the attack on the capitol on January 6.  Seems like the violence in the cities is at least worth a sentence or two."
2021-03-12 19:53:56,"Irresponsible blame of Trump by the Democrats for the severity of the pandemic in the U.S. unifies his supporters.

Trump minimized the threat of the pandemic. Yes, but so did Gov. Cuomo. He was quoted in the April 8th edition of this newspaper saying that New York had the best healthcare system, so

“'...we don’t even think it’s going to be as bad as it was in other countries.'” 

In the same article Thomas Frieden, head of the CDC under Obama, said lockdown a week earlier in New York might have saved 50% to 80% of lives.

I doubt it, but nearly all agree that lockdown and social distancing were most effective and Trump did not have the power or respect to dictate to the states.

If Trump erred early in the year, explain California, which suffered 40,000 deaths in the winter. Governor Hanscom had a year to see what every government had done.

California calls into question the harm of Mr. Trump's foolish opposition to masks. Early New York deaths when masks were voluntary; late California deaths when masks required. The NAS admits that no gold standard randomized, controlled studies exist. 

Trump's major success was in producing vaccines that worked by the end of the year. It would take a miracle, said science. But skepticism faded fast when two such vaccines were introduced after the election. Replaced by complaints of confusion over distribution. This happened everywhere except Israel. Soon we were vaccinating almost a million a day when Biden took office."
2021-03-12 19:34:09,"The New Deal was enabled by the complete loss of credibility of the Republicans.  But the Republicans are still executing a set of strategies to signal the New Deal was bad for poor white Americans.  Nixon's Southern strategy then leveraged the LBJ years and transformed the base of the Republican Party voters into the old Southern Democrats.  Bill Clinton, who acted like a Southern Democrat some of the time left the poor whites with no place to go apart from to Trump after his admission of their abandonment.  

Biden can try to turn this all around.  Hope he succeeds but he will need to get rid of the Clinton strategies that prove, to much of the 74 million Trump voters, that the major parties are aligned and working for the 1% ... In my opinion"
2021-03-12 20:04:39,"So Donald Trump mishandled the virus crisis, and Joe Biden has to do better to end the catastrophe? This is one way to look at it. 

But I look at it differently. As far as I can tell, the president has little to do with how a viral epidemic plays out.

 Whether it's to blame him or to credit him, attributing power to the president to lessen the virus's toll in lives or economic costs is magical thinking, far from reality."

Some things are out of his control, like people using their heads and thinking about others when deciding whether or not to wear masks in public or get vaccinated. But by and large Biden is doing the right thing, the smart and humane thing. 
I fault Trump for having caused a lot of cavalier attitudes  by his “minimizing” the virus destructiveness in most of the world and our communities. He will have to answer some day for the deaths he caused. All of  his bad behavior, from cheating on his wife to disrespecting veterans and women, pales compared to the damage he has done with regards to his handling of the pandemic and the lives that cost!"

2021-03-13 00:01:03,"As far as warp speed goes, true credit for swift development of covid19 vaccines goes to scientists and technologists like Bill Gates, who invested heavily in the promise of messengerRNA 10 years ago. mRNA was foreseen as a promising way to leverage gene sequencing and editing to quickly isolate specific strands of RNA to generate a targeted immune response. Thereafter it would take venture funding of firms like Moderna and BioNTech to stand up factories to produce these fragile mRNA, a process still fraught with glitches. 

Further credit goes to global health experts and forward thinkers like Gates, Ron Klain and WHO scientists. In 2014 with Ebola raging in Africa and threatening as a pandemic, they unfolded a plan to quickly fund firms to parallel-process the development of new vaccines while simultaneously standing up factories to mass produce them, even at the risk of failure in the labs. Papers were published on this back in 2015, including one by Gates in the NEJM. 

Trump gets some cred for this production funding, which mRNA startups and other pharmas availed of. But then he squandered this advantage by virus and public health denial, kleptocratic grabs of the money, and pitting Americans against each other and the world. 

Biden deserves massive credit for winning the election to sweep away criminal incompetence, cronies and virus deniers, and getting shots in arms at rates approaching 3 million per day.  Go Joe!"

Honestly we shouldn't have shut down the economy or schools completely. There was a better way. Suicide and domestic abuse 
are  through the roof in school aged children and above.  One example is the poor child that died last weekend from being beaten to death by the mother's boyfriend. He had nowhere to go. No teachers to notice the burns or bruises. Being left in a cramped apartment for months with a raging adult man was like being locked up with a caged animal.  He didn't have a chance. And he's not the only one. We're losing a generation of children to abuse, drugs, gangs, crime, depression, and poor educations.  Kids in poverty are especially falling through the cracks.

The humanity that you displayed was what America should always be about.

I’m trying not to cry, Mr. President, because you are being an American president, something that we haven’t had in four years. You jus told us that the primary job of the government is to protect us. 

We’ve had too many presidents who told us that the government’s only responsibility was to the wealthy, the privileged, because to Republicans, the only ones worthy of government protection  were those who had no interest in the rest of us. We are on a wartime footing, as you admitted, and “national unity” will get us through this.

You told us that we cannot forfeit caution ad common sense; that we’ve lost so much that with glimmers of hope on the horizon, now is not the time to yield, to give up and to heed the summons of those who would have us believe that blithely going unmasked is the easy, quick way out.

Godspeed, sir, and countless thanks and prayers for your and our success as we move forward. You “seized the moment” because you are a true leader and patriot."
2021-03-12 04:13:08,"President Biden spoke this evening of a woman who, when asked what she needed most, said: ""I just want the truth. The truth. Just tell me the truth."" 

The President himself spoke of hunger, evictions, anxiety over job loss, the thousands of dead souls, and the time lost among family and friends. 

But he has understood that, of the many challenges we face, epistemic harm is not least significant. His overall message was clear: truthfulness will be the final arbiter of whether we are a free nation or not."

2021-03-12 04:29:28,"I appreciate honesty.  Some of Biden's comments were familiar, to not let our guard down, but it's true.  If we hang on for another few months, infections and deaths will continue their downward trajectory.

It was nice to hear the Fourth of July as a goal.  If we think of the US collectively and act like a team, the team will meet this goal.  Though we need to remain cautious and safe, we can still celebrate wisely.  July 4th, 2021 will be a holiday to celebrate."
2021-03-12 04:34:01,"I like it that he has set a few specific goals that seem achievable... to make the vaccine open to everyone by May 1, and for the nation to hopefully be able to celebrate a happy 4th of July. 

I still remember when the shutdown happened, and how everyone said that ""these next 2 weeks"" would be critical. All I can say is, this is the longest 2 weeks I've ever seen. 

I process this year as a retired person of 63 (not yet 65 and eligible that way) who lives with my 2 adult sons who both lost their jobs with the shutdown. One of them was eligible for unemployment for several months, although that stopped a long time ago now, so that part of the stimulus won't help us. The other wasn't even eligible the way it fell out. I've received my first shot of the Moderna vaccination, but their opportunity for vaccination isn't in sight yet. 

But the scary part to me is that I am now reluctant at the thought of re-entering into a life where we engage with the world in what we previously considered a normal fashion. And I don't mean reluctant in the sense of protecting our health. 

I'm changed and want to continue to hide, somehow -- emotionally -- from all the anger that has shuddered across our nation month after month as extremism from both sides has pulled us away from one another. 

But July 4th. That gives me some time to gather my courage. That gives me something specific I can look forward to. 

May it be a day of peace and unity across the nation. May it be so."

2021-03-12 04:36:54,"This was an outstanding speech.  We now have a real leader as president.  He took great pains to tell the public what they needed to hear, which was the truth.  The last guy only talked to his base and told them what they wanted to hear.  Truth telling should not be a political issue, but after the last four years, it is.  

There were a few subtle, but well deserved political digs.  But by and large, the speech was devoid of politics and focused on the issues.   

President Biden presented a plan to get us out of this Covid mess.  That's called problem solving.  That's what real leaders do.  He never once talked himself up.  He acted like a manager, as any president should.

We are now vaccinating over 2000 people a day.  If we can get that number up to 3000, this thing will be over by summer.

The way back to normalcy is then a massive get the shot campaign.  We need a huge advertising campaign to get people motivated to get vaccinated.  One big push, and we could get to over 200 million vaccinated by June 1.  That would be incredible.  

The science isn't quite there yet, but getting all the children immunized by fall would really be phenomenal.  Now that we have competent leadership, this too could happen.  Round 1- Biden."
2021-03-12 05:15:53,"Joe Biden does give the appearance of trying his best. It does look like he’s making an honest effort to address America's problems, with pandemic alleviation holding top priority. 
It's refreshing that he didn't declare his candidacy on day one and isn’t making re-election his number one priority.
It’s also refreshing he isn’t blatantly using alternative facts to cloak the true intentions of his administration.
With his vigorous pledge for truth and science, hopefully all Americans jump on that bandwagon and rebel against lies, pseudo-science and falsehoods.
For all intents and purposes, he makes me believe he is going to lead by example, with integrity as a pillar of his actions. 
I’m glad enough patriots came through to enable a fair election, thus allowing this new change for the better."

Just one criticism of President Biden's address: Some states are already wide open, ignoring masks and other restrictions, so his promise of small groups gathering by July 4th should have included the word SAFELY.  We could be hit with a devastating surge from mindless carelessness now."
2021-03-12 05:37:31,Reading this as I shiver and shake after receiving the vaccine this morning.  I am so grateful; I feel terrible but know it's working--unpleasant but eventually we'll all be safe.  It's a minor inconvenience compared to the alternative.

2021-03-12 06:01:27,For me this is what a bipartisan America should be. Help for all of us. It is also what a president should be. Calm reassuring soft spoken where actions speak louder than words ever can.
2021-03-12 06:04:44,"After the last 4 years, I finally feel a sense of relief there is a presidential president in the WhiteHouse. There was an unconscious level of stress I sustained daily with Trump.
By, the way, I live in Texas, the educational institutions in and around Dallas are maintaining vigilance with wearing masks.  Please understand a lot of people in Texas do not support the governors position on easing restrictions at this point."
2021-03-12 06:10:30,"""July 4th Gatherings with Close Family"" - That doesn't sound like much fun."
2021-03-12 05:17:49,"A year ago, the former guy was trying to pack the churches for Easter with no vaccine.

Thank goodness we have a real President this year."
2021-03-12 06:20:49,"Biden's tone was perfect. condemning the racist
attacsk on Asian Americans was needed

The righties do not know how to attack Biden."
2021-03-12 06:22:49,"This is a very smart course of action. Yes, support for pandemic aid is likely to be popular and exist in individual districts and they fan fan its flames with appearances, speeches and engaging the public. That is gracious and courageous leadership AND smart and savvy politics: a tough combination that will be hard to beat next time a national election rolls around: Trump-loyalists and reactionaries of all kinds, take note, this man knows what he is doing and is moreover, really, really good at it. What a win for our democracy and our country."
2021-03-12 06:26:41,"BUT looking beyond this emergency $1.9 trillion, to the Senate filibuster pickle we are in regarding new legislation—

We see Joe Manchin (of red red West Virginia) and Kyrsten Sinema (whose idol is maverick Republican John McCain—she even mimics him on the Senate floor). 

And the sad fact is that the Democratic Party machine well-knew that if they ran a has-been out-of-touch Joe Biden who has difficulty in speaking and no charisma (witness his poorly attended campaign stops in Iowa)—

That they risked little or no ""coattails"", even running against a disaster like Trump. And that's precisely where we are, with significant loss of House seats and a hair's breadth advantage in the Senate (and that thanks to the hapless Trump in Georgia).

And finally, no one wants to mention that it's walking on eggshells with Manchin and Sinema—if one of them defected to the GOP that would be it."
2021-03-12 06:41:09,"Like a third string quarterback, coming out of nowhere, to wow the crowd with his competence, his durability and his understanding of the game, I wouldn’t bet against Biden. It wouldn’t be any fun."
2021-03-12 06:46:00,"Opening up to all May 1 is a betrayal of those who are already eligible and incapable of finding an appointment to get vaccinated! Over 65 and completely locked out of appointments to get vaccinated in NJ. Two months of incessantly clicking on poorly designed and completely uncoordinated appointment web sites with no results. Any appointments that open up are gone in seconds, before you can fill out the 2 pages of incredibly repetitive questions. Signed up to be notified of available appointments with no response from anyone in 2 months"
2021-03-12 06:48:52,"President Biden has impressed me time and again with his acute understanding of the urgency for action. His humanity is a salve for a nation traumatized by the toxicity and wild ugliness of Trumpism. Biden's decency and call for unity will fall on some willfully deaf ears but he is saying the right things and I, for one, am most grateful for that."
2021-03-12 07:02:28,"Speech was part lecture, part wakeupcall, and completely boring.  Utterly boring.  Total snoozefest.  

I loved it."
2021-03-12 08:13:37,"Americans are lucky regarding the vaccine and how quickly the Biden administration has acted to manufacture doses and distribute them at record speed. Here in Europe we are plagued by incompetent leaders who, despite the most serious health crises in a hundred years, act as if we treating the common cold. As a result, Europe will take at least 6-9 months longer than the US to recover from covid 19, leaving its economy even in more of a shambles. I have never seen so many people in despair as now."
2021-03-12 09:10:17,"Americans must never, ever, ever forget that not one single Republican voted to support this historic relief bill.   Those Republicans must be made to pay in the mid term elections."
2021-03-12 07:53:08,"At last, some common sense regarding opening up. It cannot be done overnight. Please take heed of what happened here, in the UK. We opened too quickly, and the wrong places, and ended up back to square one. We made mistakes, don't repeat them, use them for your own benefit."
2021-03-12 08:03:01,"It's like a breath of fresh air!   Competence and willingness to work to improve things, instead of self-serving lies, laziness, accusations, and whining.  Even with many problems to solve, it feels like spring is here, opportunity abounds!   And with any luck our republican brethren will find the strength to abandon their focus on imagined grievances and contribute positively.  The clear majority of the United States has chosen a leader who appeals to our 'better angels', we now have the opportunity to get our act together and re-establish a positive role and future for our own citizens and the world!"
2021-03-12 07:10:37,"While I applaud President Biden's fabulous relief package, he seems a bit out of touch re Seniors, African Americans on the vaccine: he proclaimed tonight that 65 percent of over 65s have been vaccinated. The more important figure is that 35 percent of us have not been vaccinated, while less vulnerable tens of millions have. Here's that story:

After failing to secure a vaccine appointment despite being in a high priority group – mid-70s with other vulnerabilities – my wife and I drove last week to a vaccine mega site in Edison, N.J, to plead our case face to face. That too did not work, but what astounded us was seeing streams of much younger people going in to receive jabs. At most 10 percent were over 65 or African American.

As a NYT article yesterday indicated, states have moved on to vaccinate other groups, continuing the severe endangerment of these two disadvantaged communities.

Two months ago, The Times criticized New Jersey’s vaccination plan, which “opened the floodgates of vaccine eligibility to about 4.5 million additional residents"" when priority groups continued to have trouble making appointments. But no action was taken to correct the plan’s deadly failures.   

The greatest challenge facing the nation in 2021 was ensuring the most vulnerable would be vaccinated first. 
New Jersey is a liberal state with a caring, capable governor. Its failure on this overwhelming national priority does not bode well for the multiple US struggles ahead."
2021-03-12 09:14:24,"How refreshing to hear integrity instead of dishonesty and division, if Biden was a hundred and ten he would come across as more  statesmanlike than Trump. Just what were Trump's supporters thinking when they blindly followed the con man."
2021-03-12 08:38:40,"In the 1960s, the national goal was to put a man on the Moon by the end of the decade.    

In 2021, the national goal is to have a 4th of July cookout with friends and family.

How humbling.

2021-03-12 07:29:01,I am so pleased to see that photo! I had wondered what the Biden White House would do about the previous Administration's developed addiction to a sea of U.S. flags on all possible occasions. And thank goodness they are returned to hanging naturally instead of being braced and turned into stiff posters.
2021-03-12 08:06:20,"Wow!  To be cared for by a president simply because we are Americans, no other strings attached!  We almost forgot what that feels like.  

This is supposed to be how we should feel.  How we almost forgot.  How we almost gave up on sanity.  How we almost gave up on hope.  How we lost so much in a pandemic we never imagined.  How we have endured so much pain.  

Joe Biden is a president for the people, all people, whether they voted for him or not.  He’s not trying to manipulate, or use, or sneak.  He’s trying to make us heal.  Like a real president should.  

We’re on our way to being “back”.  And boy, does it feel good."
2021-03-12 10:06:50,I will try to enjoy the non normalcy until then.  Traffic is bearable now and I’ve enjoyed visiting several less crowded cities to include NYC.
2021-03-12 10:48:00,"What a difference! Finally it is about us-all of us. We now need the infrastructure bill and more. So, if the filibuster must go then it must go."
2021-03-12 11:01:33,"So this is what I remember about presidential leadership. Tell it like it is.  And Oooo what a relief it is. 

Now we will see evaporation theory. Thats were we give the poor and middle money to spend and let it evaporate to the top. Instead of trickle down theory were it seems to stop trickling some were around the upper middle."
2021-03-12 10:22:52,"President Biden originally promised a 100M doses of COVID vaccine for the first 100 days but he has upped it from 1.5M/day to 1.7M/day to now 2.0M/day. This is how government - and anyone, personal or corporate, for that matter - should operate: under promise and over deliver. This is daylight as opposed to Trump's darkness.

The prior admin is about photo-ops and self-dealings. The Biden admin is about giving everyone a chance to breath and to recuperate from the bruising pandemic, made worse by Trump and his money and power grabbing cronies.

Mr Biden and his team are making Americans proud to be American without vainglory or selfish pride"
2021-03-12 10:57:02,"I just wish Joe would bring his can-do attitude and competency to us just outside his front door.

Here in Washington DC (which absurdly wants to become the 51st state) cannot even get a website working for appointments.  It’s mid March and the DC government is finally pre-registering resident meanwhile reserving 10 percent of doses for non residents.

Everyone’s as know since May that a vaccine was coming and no one in local government bothered to plan for it until just recently?  And Washington wants to become a state???  The elected mayor and council can’t even run a city!"
2021-03-12 04:32:37,"It's nice to have a President who is genuinely empathetic to those who have lost loved ones and those who are struggling to pay the rent or find a job, a President who doesn't lie and who is honest about the challenges we still face, a President who is working on behalf of all of us, especially those most in need, and a President who doesn't talk about himself ad nauseum.   The GOP voted against the stimulus package and seem to genuinely believe they can win back the House in 2022 by beating the Dr. Seuss / cancel culture drum, by going on and on about repealing an estate tax that effects only the richest among us, but they are delusional; their public response has mostly been tepid, because they know their constituents are finally wising up and wondering what the government can do for them, are about to see how it can make their lives better when the government is run by a President who cares about all of us.  Thank you Joe Biden and Kamala Harris."
2021-03-12 05:20:25,"The Money part of this plan in two words: Trickle UP.  Finally.
   Republicans, ask a Democrat to explain this concept to you. Slowly, and using small words.
    Thanks, Democrats. The Party Of Real People."
2021-03-12 05:20:44,"I'm feeling better now about things than I have in a long time. It's so very strange to see the U.S. government spending massive amounts of money on something other than banks or the military. This is driving Republican politicians crazy. Tells me all I need to know about them. 

This current crisis is fundamentally different from the post-9/11 period (when trillions of dollars eventually went to the military) and also post-financial crisis in 2008 and 2009 (when the banks shook down the government for eventually trillions of dollars and thus caused many to become disillusioned with President Obama). 

The economic depression of the 1930s, as terrible as it was, discredited once and for all the idea that the United States could ever go back to the mythical limited government of the Gilded Age. It wasn't really limited government but rather a government that treated workers like trash and privileged the interests of robber barons. Calvin Coolidge turned out to be the last U.S. president who ever seriously tried to bring about a restoration of the 19th century. The boom-bust cycle finally produced a bust so awful in 1929 that the government had to step in like it never had before. 

Will the pandemic have a similar effect by discrediting once and for all the idea that the reins of government should be handed over to private sector grifters like Donald Trump and treated like a business (or more accurately an ailing company being bled dry by a private equity firm)? I hope so."
2021-03-12 05:51:37,"Remember, a year ago today, the former guy said:  

“It’s just one person coming in from ‘Gina. Everything is under control.”

The former guy then gifted Biden with over 470, 000 American corpses on American soil."
2021-03-12 06:17:28,"The promise of July 4th with family is incredibly uplifting. However, I am already worried about how the GOP will use this to their advantage. They know that denying Democrats wins, even if it harms the country  -and, disproportionately, their own voters- is recipe for electoral success. 

President Biden acknowledged how important it is that we all keep following the rules for July 4th to be a reality. Defying mask mandates and reopening states is already a political issue; now the Republicans have even more incentive to refuse to cooperate with the federal government. Even if more people die, even (especially?) if those are mostly ""their"" people, it can all be blamed on the Democrats. ""They promised you a July 4th with your family!"" ""Look at those liberals on the coasts party while Real Americans are still struggling!"" ""Joe Biden has already forgotten you!"" 

It'd be the regressive, self-harming economic and social policies of the last 40 years in microcosm: a engine of grievance and bitterness that only powers the careers of the people who fuel it. 

I'd like to believe this crisis would never be exploited in such a cruel way. But every single Republican in the House and Senate showed us they would rather let Americans starve, sicken, and die than help the Democrats pass a law to help those same Americans. Why wouldn't a group with that moral calculus blame Democrats for the escalating tragedy of their own making?"
2021-03-12 10:41:43,"Lets remember people...goals are not set in stone. Especially when it involves millions of disparate people, thousands of disparate organizations and delivery systems.  

This July 4th goal...is not set in any stone. But are written on paper, with erasble ink. Should a certain demographic decide to muck up the works, on purpose to serve their self righteousness, and absurd beliefs...that goal could be undermined ..."
2021-03-12 10:09:59,"“Sleepy Joe” is more woke than any of the Trump regime’s leaders, enablers, and cult followers. Thanks to Democrats for providing solutions — and hope — instead of lies, corruption, ineptitude, and despair."
2021-03-12 10:32:59,President Biden - the right man in the right place at the right time
2021-03-12 09:56:18,"“July 4th with your loved ones is the goal,” he said. This is exactly what we all need  forward thinking and decent hope overcoming the pandemic together."
2021-03-12 11:09:50,"A refreshing outlook in comparison to the old guy. Broader horizons are in the near future. I worry though, who will have the funds to travel for July 4th celebrations?
If healthy means wealthy, then vaccinations are going to be the stimulus."
2021-03-12 11:03:42,"The July 4th ""goal"" is fine, but hard to take seriously. Even if we achieve mass immunity, we'll still have a variant issue.

We'll likely be wearing masks for a long time. Are we dumb enough to risk our lives (yet again) because we want to watch fireworks?"
2021-03-12 11:00:52,I keep hearing about vaccines everywhere but I cannot find one place that has them and will let me get one. Am I the only one who is fed up with this awful set up? I swear I cannot figure what or where I need to register for the vaccine and I'm not going to anymore shoddy badly worded website either.
2021-03-12 11:00:50,"Sub-Headline. Language means something. My recollection is that the President did not use the non-word ""normalcy""."
2021-03-12 10:13:51,"Thank you, President Trump for the success of Operation Warp Speed."
2021-03-12 11:32:49,"Biden has exceeded all my expectations, especially in his support of the poor and the middle classes, at which his relief (it is not a ""stimulus"" plan) is aimed. This has been a natural disaster, like a hurricane that has covered the whole U.S., and he aims to alleviate suffering and hardship. And he has just the right approach when he says we're on a wartime footing against the virus.

That said, I think the goal in a highly vaccinated America is large gatherings. Here the scientists just really don't know how the disease will unfold. Cases of COVID-19 or something in that family will never fall to zero. If that's our goal, we'll never go to the theater, to a crowded restaurant, to a ballgame with a full stadium again. Let's wait to see what the statistics say before we foreclose the option of returning the pre-pandemic normal."
2021-03-12 11:38:45,"Mr Biden ran for president twice and failed. But here he is, Joe Biden, 46th President of the United States. That somehow, once again, the right person has come to lead us through what may be the most critical year in our lifetimes. Where we can either recover and grow strong or stumble and descend further. Not just in lives lost, but in our values.

It seems providential with only our two latest presidents, we see the worst and the best of us. That we made a choice this past election but you couldn't tell which would prevail until nearly the end. How one side resists becoming irrelevant, using formidable powers to influence masses of people, while the other stands fast, confident they won.

The 530,000 lives lost seem an abstraction because I don't know anyone who died or contracted the virus. This large number isn't even one percent of our population. I know the loss is tragic but I don't feel it. They suffer and die out of sight, making them easy to minimize in favor of getting back to normal 

Red states take advantage, imposing dangerous disregard of safety to bring back the economy, make Democrats look bad, and take credit for the recovery. They're confident no matter how many die, most won't see or feel it. President Biden's determined we not forget every life and livelihood lost, and only working together will make it stop. 

He reminds us we're in darkness but finding the light is the most American thing we do."
2021-03-12 11:47:02,"Why did the Progressives only give $1.9 Trillion in the stimulus?  Why only $600 Billion of direct and indirect transfers to the lower 50% of Americans?   With the vast barrowing power of the US Treasury, and the printing power of the Fed,  and firm control of both Houses of Congress and the Presidency,  why not transfer ten times that amount, or $6 Trillion to the lower half of Americans?   Why not $6 Trillion every year?   The current time limited small transfers are just a band aid.  Go big or go home."
2021-03-12 11:34:46,"I'm sorry, but this article is contradictory. The President did NOT say that there would be a return to normalcy by July 4, as in the first paragraph. In fact, he said that lockdowns would have to continue after July 4. All we could do by July 4 would be to have small gatherings of a limited family and a couple of guests in a back yard. Nothing more. And, he said that if there was another flare-up of the virus, even that would have to be stopped. That may be normalcy to the author, but it isn't normalcy to me. I am an Independent, but all of my Democratic friends are planning to go on trips via airplanes after their second shots, and are already going to ignore the President's prediction, whether he likes it or not. On the other hand, I am going to stay put, and invite nobody to my home, and take no vacation. I have no idea what Republicans will do, but I think that they will follow the example of my Democratic friends. And, by the way, contrary to what the President said, there have been no reports in Arizona of attacks on Asian-Americans. None. Maybe the reports he is referring to were in Delaware."
2021-03-12 12:01:14,"America has fared badly with coronavirus.
A President who should have taken the reins when the pandemic started was instead nursing his personal grievances.
Even with the vaccination programme running and new treatments accessed to alleviate some of the symptoms, we must be aware that we are dealing with a deadly virus that will always be one step ahead of us.
I was therefore slightly bemused by the gatherings though to be planned for Independence Day. Of course celebrate this day, but remember there will be one unwanted guest present who will stop at nothing to survive."
2021-03-12 11:25:15,"Joe Biden appears to be channeling Franklin Roosevelt.  It would seem to me that he is on his way to a historic presidency.  That something I never would have thought likely or possible a little more than year ago. Remember, at the time of the Nevada Democratic primary in February 2020 Biden was being written off as a doddering old man decades after his prime.  He had no chance against the likes of Bernie Sanders or the decabillionaire Michael Bloomberg.  All of that changed almost overnight with the endorsement of James Clyburn before the South Carolina primary.  

Almost miraculously, Biden went from sure loser to the apparent nominee just before the declaration of a national emergency over COVID.  Biden would have faced a brutal convention fight if not for COVID.  Instead, he patiently followed a conservative campaign strategy to hold his coalition together until the November election.  He won, although just barely in the electoral college and to fight a virtual coup attempt by Trump and his acolytes.

Now, as the leader of a narrow majority in Congress and head of the executive branch he is forging a bold and consequential presidency.  In six weeks he has literally transformed the American government and he is on his way.  Progressivism has not been muted by him, it has grown with initiatives that have broad popular support beyond his Democratic base.  

Not only is he not a doddering old man he is just the right leader for the formidable tasks that he is handling."
2021-03-12 11:26:16,"Sincere, persuasive, honest, empathetic and calm describes President Biden's address to our nation Thursday, March 11, 2021. Joe Biden may not be the president all of us want but he is the president we need now."
2021-03-12 11:58:38,I hate to tell him - we have been doing this for months.  Nobody is paying attention to the government on this topic anymore.
2021-03-12 11:26:17,"I'm happy for this legislation, because it's good policy.  We need to stop focusing on vague platitudes about Biden's character and keep our eye on the ball, ie passing more progressive policy like this.  

Character is ultimately just an act, when it comes to politics.  Trump was horrible, but so were George W Bush and Reagan. It's not enough to look like a nice person on the surface. 

I'll take a jerk who votes the right way over a nice person who does not."
2021-03-12 11:31:36,"After four years of chaos, confusion, and senseless loss of life, we finally have a real president who cares!
May 45 just keep out of politics and keep his mouth closed. The man is up to no good."
2021-03-12 13:00:39,"President Biden's address to the nation was just what we all needed to hear. It was soothing and compassionate, hopeful and sincere. His message to the American people was strong. ""I need you to help me."" He does. It's going to take solid unity across the entire country to help him and us win this war against the virus. Continuing to do the right thing by wearing a mask, keeping hands clean and distancing ourselves from too much closeness will continue to help. But what will really help us win is getting a vaccination, and states need to work as hard as possible to make sure there is enough to go around in good time. Joe Biden is doing an amazing job in his first 50 days. We're beginning to breathe easier. Let's unify from sea to shining sea to keep the momentum going. Let's help our president win this battle that has caused so much suffering and pain in the past year. Can you hear me, Governor Abbott? Can you hear me, Governor Reeves? Help your president."
2021-03-12 12:23:49,"It was so striking to me that President Biden ended by saying he ""looks forward to seeing"" us.  The Former Guy never, ever came out among regular citizens--except that once at the ballpark when he got booed out of the joint.  Joe's one of us.  He spoke with us, not at us.  It was just so wonderful."
2021-03-12 12:07:49,"I love the smell of sanity in the morning.
Things really are getting better.

Quiet, experienced, competent, compassionate leadership has returned. 
Thank you, President Biden.

As more people get vaccinated, we get closer to normal.
I saw Dr. Fauci on the Rachel Maddow Show last night and it was so good to hear him speak freely, in detail on progress and risks ahead. 
Science and facts matter more than ego again.

Congress is working for the people. Democrats press forward. Much work to do.
Republicans sulk, they hate it when Democrats do the same things they do. How dare we exercise our majority position!
Our government is beginning to do what the GOP fears most, help people. 
  
Merrick Garland was confirmed as Attorney General.
Sweet. (I hope Obama smiled at that!)

Optimism and hope.
The beginning of the end.
Feels better and better every day."
2021-03-12 12:54:31,"I did not vote for Biden because I wanted to hear what I wanted to hear. 
I didn't vote for Biden because I expected perfection.
I only wanted honesty and decency.
And  experience.
I am so glad I voted for him.
When he won, I won."
2021-03-12 13:24:15,"At this point, we have already vaccinated many of the elderly, at-risk people. Therefore, I support opening the vaccines to everyone. We need to get as many people vaccinated as soon as possible so that we can get our schools open. 
I know that up to 40% of the population will decline the vaccine. I am not looking forward to reading articles about people who refused the vaccine, refused to wear masks, became infected with COVID-19, were hospitalized, and have subsequent medical debt they can't pay. I will have problems mustering up any sympathy for that group."
2021-03-12 12:35:57,"Brilliant speech! 

A big challenge, concrete program and implementation plan, metrics and goals to meet.  Shared responsibility for success and, most importantly, strength and optimism. In a word, leadership!

Heartfelt thanks to President Biden!"
2021-03-12 12:40:33,"Leadership is a real thing, and  without it a country withers as the rich and greedy line their pockets.
In this speech President Biden showed the compassion and courage of FDR. The next years will provide many opportunities for uniting the US to strengthen our country and its alliances.
I so wish him luck and I so hope that the new Voting Rights Bill passes, so vote by mail doesn't go away."
2021-03-12 13:00:54,"President Joe is a welcome reminder of something we've missed over the last 4 or 5 years: real true honest to gosh decency.  I watched him last night; something I would not normally do, but am glad I did.
His laser focus on controlling the virus quickly and fairly will set the tenor of the next four years.  A president for all of us; one who has empathy as well as a logical plan to give hope to those who struggle for every bite of bread, never mind that piece of the pie. I thank him for that.
The way to end the ""us vs. them"" war is to give the have nots a helping hand while reminding the haves that reaching out a hand to help doesn't cost them.
We're going to get feet and feet of snow in my neighborhood starting today, and in the spirit of President Joe and his empathy,  when I put out extra food for the birds I'm going to add extra on the ground for the squirrels so they can stock up.   For me, that's detente, for sure.
Maybe we can just all get along. What a beautiful concept."
2021-03-12 12:40:09,"Don't promise something you can't guarantee.

If there is an uptick in deaths or even not as much progress by July 4, the republicans will use it against Biden.

He should have said best case scenario and probably not instead of possible."
2021-03-12 12:34:15,"Oh how I wish Joe Biden was President in January 2020. While there would still have been deaths from the virus, I know for sure it would not have been over 525,000!  He never forgets to mention those we’ve lost, and last night included those we lost to other causes who also had to die alone. His empathy is endless. What a huge difference he makes."
2021-03-12 13:15:14,"Nancy Pelosi hit it right on the head.  Republicans can vote ""No"" and still endear themselves with their constituents and avoid incurring the wrath of their benefactors:  corporations and the wealthy,   It's the same tactic used by McConnell:  Condemn Trump for this actions to incite insurrection after voting to exonerate him from impeachment."
2021-03-12 13:02:04,He wasn't my top choice in the primaries. But he is delivering for the American people. Not looking so sleepy after all.
2021-03-12 12:14:39,"How refreshing it is to view our president acting... well, presidential!  He might not be superb in his presentation skills, but he certainly conveys a sense of earnestness, compassion and honesty, attributes we haven’t heard from the White House in the past four years.  If I had any criticism of last night’s event it would be directed at the press.  No doubt it was made clear in advance that the president would not be taking questions following his speech.  For a few members of the press in attendance to shout out questions was inappropriate, impolite and disrespectful.  It’s time for you to clean up your act!"
2021-03-12 13:59:37,"It amazes me that tens of millions of American voters watched Biden speak - maybe, if it aired on Fox - and wrote him off as somehow deficient to Trump.  How can we see and hear the exact same things and come to such completely different conclusions?  Makes wonder if the sky is really blue."
2021-03-12 13:29:10,Talk about low to zero expectations. We expect more from our leaders.
2021-03-12 13:54:32,"A prolonged shutdown would have been unnecessary if everyone masked up last March and the defense production act was used to produce and distribute PPE

The Trump war on masking and the republicans who supported his war on masking is why we are here today.  

It’s patriotic to wear a mask and any other opinion is just selfish, wrong and hurtful. Sometimes there aren’t two sides to a story - just the facts and the truth."
2021-03-12 13:15:18,"Biden can try to give people hope by saying we can gather by the Fourth of July, but what he didn't say is that 70 percent of Americans need to be fully vaccinated before we can gather.  I know how badly he wants to give us hope that the end is in sight, but it depends on a very specific goal, which is also going to depend on vaccinating Americans under 16.

70 percent is the goal, Mr. President.  Never forget that."
2021-03-12 14:05:03,"Truth over lies and empathy over bombast. This is what stood out to me listening to President Biden last evening.

To hear him speak of all Americans and to all Americans -- not ""us vs them"" ""red vs blue"" -- is the restoration to sanity and unity we desperately needed!

Thank you, President Biden!

Now to the Senate where the filibuster must go so we can protect voting rights."
2021-03-12 14:02:41,"To paraphrase lyrics from Paul Simon's ""Mrs. Robinson"": ""Joe, our nation turns its lonely eyes to you"". Mr. President you are the man for this moment. Thanks for truly making America great again."
2021-03-12 14:00:23,"My family is burying my mom today. We missed her last year because of Covid. She spent it largely alone, and she was a very social person. I feel robbed of something I could never replace.  She got her first vaccine, but was already too sick for her second.

Leaves me suffering an intangible regret and sense of helplessness that I have no control over. Feels a lot like anger I guess.

Hopeful this summer we can finally do a proper remembrance."
2021-03-12 12:40:15,"Let us face it, folks, 'Operation Warpspeed,' a program enacted under the Trump Administration, was the obvious and correct course of action given the impending Pandemic.  It was not a mental feat or intellectual enterprise worthy of praising Trump's leadership or a defining moment of his Presidency.  The clear choice, and quite frankly elementary and obvious, was creating vaccines for the nation and mobilizing the private sector. There was no choice or decision to deliberate. 

I see people getting tripped up opining whether President Trump or Biden should get credit for combating this virus. Let's be honest giving Trump credit for doing what is expected is like giving participation awards to children in sports.  No, the recognition Trump should have received but didn't is for being a leader when the nation needed unity.  Instead, he made mask-wearing political.  Right versus left, effectively pitting Americans against each other.  Had Trump united the country and told everyone to wear a mask, it is patriotic in times of war, and he may very well be the President today.  It is improbable any President is ever going to be respected by every American citizen. At least Joe Biden is acting and speaking to the American people with whole sentences, frankly, and as an uniter,  and addressing the entire nation."
2021-03-12 13:27:07,"President Biden's speech continued to shed light and hope during these very dim days.

He has only been in office for 65 days and continues to make a larger, positive impact than I thought possible.

He is not merely talking the talk, he is actually walking the walk. It feels wonderful to finally have a consistently restful night's sleep. It feels incredible to not go to bed nor wake up every day afraid, angry or anxious. 

I didn't think he could top his victory speech on November 7th, but he did.

Thank you President Biden for being a strong beacon of leadership and promise."
2021-03-12 13:37:05,"If only we had some leadership and systems in place here in PA.  We know vaccines are available, but no one can get an appointment even if they are eligible.  I applaud the hopeful message of Biden, but we are still in the middle of a complete failure by federal, state, and local government and corporate America.  In fact, the leaders through out the pandemic after one year seem to be the NBA stars and other athletes that showed us what leadership and sacrifice could be in 2020.  There was no doubting science.  They heard the facts and put in plans that allowed them to keep playing and competing safely.  No other industry was able to achieve this sort of solidarity in America.  Congrats to our athletes.  Rising above politics and failings by governments and business.  Embracing the game and love for one another."
2021-03-12 13:49:22,"I found his talk with the American Public to be informative with empathy and a kind gentle tone. He has now on several occasions spoke to us to let us know it has not been perfect, but they are working on that.  He admitted he can do better.  He did not blame someone else - he took responsibility for the difficulties in getting the vaccine.   It is about time relief is being given to those who have lost so much because of covid not their doing.  The think I will remember about this stimulus is that NO REPUBLICAN voted for it.  They left regular Americans to keep seeking help from food banks, charity organizations.  Imagine if they had to find rent money, food money, insurance money, mortgage money.  It is apparent that they after doing some negotiations decided it was not a good thing.  If they are what DJT created, we are in trouble."
2021-03-12 14:09:20,"Always  wondered how it must have felt listening to a FDR fireside chat as Americans struggled to emerge from the Great Depression. Now after Biden's comforting message of hope as we emerge from the great pandemic, I know."
2021-03-12 14:10:30,I am sincerely grateful and proud to have a President who speaks to ALL Americans.
2021-03-12 11:18:17,"Joe Biden is already becoming tiresome. And we’re only 50 days in to what may prove to be the sleepiest - and most destructive - presidency in the post WW II era. 

Biden’s speeches are overwrought, repetitive and full of schlocky sentiment. His delivery is so canned and always trying for a home run yet barely ever hitting a single. And while we don’t have Biden perhaps boldfaced lying like Trump, he definitely is rather slippery with the facts. His graceless disregard for the work done under Trump on vaccines and his assertion that nothing had been done to fight the pandemic last spring was shameful. 

Worst of all - and most dangerous - Biden’s somnolent manner is lulling an inordinate number of Americans to unwittingly acquiesce to the biggest expansion of the administrative state since the 1960’s. Biden and the cadre of statist around him mouth a lot of platitudes about community and neighborhoods, yet they are on the path to further gutting our Constitution and turning this country completely over to the oligarchs, the elite and the meritocracy while the rest of us are left further behind. 

We can only pray that 2022 will be a reckoning akin to 2010."
2021-03-12 04:23:59,"I'm a progressive. Every time I get mildly annoyed at Biden, the next thing he does moves me to his corner again. His decency and steady optimism is profoundly appropriate to this time in the history of the nation. I'm proud of him and proud to be an American again."
2021-03-12 04:36:38,That speech was a home run.  He spoke to the people with tremendous empathy and understanding.  How we've longed to have that decency back in our White House.
2021-03-12 13:16:44,Biden is the best thing since sliced bread.
2021-03-12 13:06:25,Is there a better leader right now for our country? The last paragraph/Biden’s quote says it all. For the nation and the world.
2021-03-12 15:18:14,Biden and all news outlets are touting the fact that 'vaccine supplies have risen' since Biden took office. Of course they have.  All supply chains take time to ramp up- there is a word for this phenomenon-it is called math.
2021-03-12 12:53:42,"According to Washington post the former guy told 30,573 lies during his presidency, averaging 21 per day. I challenge anyone to list 21 lies that Biden has spoken in the last 10 years. The collective blood pressure of the nation is falling. That alone will have a profound effect on the nations health. Joe and Kamala are  indeed the best we could have hoped for at this time in history."
2021-03-12 13:13:41,"I liked his emphasis on working seriously and together. The announcement that J & J is working with Merck to produce vaccines as quickly as possible was a strong example of putting aside our differences for the common good.  It's like something you'd expect during a war effort and we ARE at war-- with Covid.

The Dems had a big victory yesterday and I'm glad he didn't focus on that partisan angle.  He focused on cooperating and working together."
2021-03-12 15:04:32,"What a difference a year makes. On the one year  anniversary of the WHO declaring a pandemic, it was fitting  to see a competent leader who holds promise and a strategy  for America.
No gimmicks, chants, tweets. Just a man with a plan. A real person, speaking  complete  sentences with a cohesive theme. 
Way to go, Joe!"
2021-03-12 15:27:44,"Now that we've had the canned speech, would it be too much to demand a news conference where the President takes questions from the press. Does the fawning, yawning press even remember how to do that?"
2021-03-12 14:57:29,"Biden’s speech was terrific. He talks like a regular Joe, no pun intended. He gave us all hope that our lives can return to normal sometime this year, perhaps by July somewhat. He has done so much more for us than Trump could have ever done."
2021-03-12 15:38:03,"Biden, in his 80’s never did a thing in congress except take honors for what Trump accomplished."
2021-03-12 15:12:55,Phase 3 is tracking for mid-2024 for vaccine availability in Missouri. It's surreal seeing all the hype telling people get the shot when it's not reasonably available.
2021-03-12 14:36:21,"Wow. President Biden seems like a good person. The second coming of FDR or LBJ. A little early for that. 
His admin seem like hyperpartisans who want to keep us divided. And they seem to have high praise for themselves when what they have done has not had any effect so far, because it is too early. Their refusal to credit The Trump admin with anything good is telling. They are like the guys who grab the football from the player who scored the touchdown so they can spike it and dance around."
2021-03-12 14:55:13,"Making ""small gatherings"" of ""close family"" for outdoor barbecues on 4 July a reality is a highly unambitious goal.  Nearly any activity outdoors, particularly in the Summer, is extremely safe.  Plenty of these activities were occurring on 4 July a year ago, with little to no observed surges in infections and hospitalizations.

On July 4, 2021, America will be in vastly better position than it was a year go, on the same day, due to the large fraction of the population that will be protected against infection and/or sickness.  President Biden should recognize this and describe a return to normal that goes far beyond small outdoor gatherings."
2021-03-12 15:51:24,"Every once in a while, I switch to FOX after a speech to hear their spin on it.This time I was immediately taken aback at the terrible anger on person's face and his attempt to raise the ire of his viewers by indignantly chastising  Biden for having the nerve to  tell Americans how they can celebrate the 4th of July and get together because Americans have the right to be with whomever they want and celebrate as they wish. Needless to say, I changed the station immediately. Obviously the person missed the message of the speech."
2021-03-12 14:40:18,"I mean, even in locked down Mass we had small bbqs for the 4th last summer. 

Frankly, it's getting a little irritating how Biden is setting these milestones we've already achieved or is setting the bar just a tad higher than his predecessor. Then when we've met the conditions he outlined, it's this great victory of his administration. You want most of the schools open? Could've told the teacher's unions to take a hike ages ago. And plenty of states had their schools open last year because they had governors telling the teachers to get to work, since there's no proven significant risk. Vaccines? Don't get me wrong- I'm thrilled we're doing more. But you also set the goal as slightly above the capacity of what we were hitting on Inauguration Day. And even under Trump, the governors and vaccine makers were doing this independently enough that there would've been a ramp up anyways.

I'll give credit where credit is due. The stimulus package was in fact a feat (I say that as we still don't completely know its effects, even as I believe they'll be positive). A tad of freedom by July 4th though? Honestly, the biggest impediment to that is government restrictions and people's paranoia. Now I'd be impressed if we were being promised huge parades then... not everyone having two people in their backyard with masks on like last year"
2021-03-12 14:27:39,"What?  A president who says he'll walk with us during these difficult times?  
I almost forgot what that was like.  Thank you President Biden for bringing some sense of normalcy back so quickly."
2021-03-12 16:32:07,"Thank you, Mr President. Your steady hand, firm and swift action has brought a relief to American citizens that is immeasurable. From the minute you declared your run, I believed and stated often that you were the only
one who can fix this mess. Your service is much appreciated."
2021-03-12 14:36:44,July 4th and you have to only have small groups outside.  It seems that he thinks the vaccine is not effective.  Where is the science in that if everyone around you is vaccinated you still can't socialize.
2021-03-12 14:13:22,"Joe said a lot of comforting things in this speech. He understands the difficulty the pandemic has caused ordinary Americans, and I feel like I can trust the competence of his team to provide relief. He's not the kind of speaker who makes me hang on every word, like Obama, or be revulsed by every word like Trump. 
He is, however, marvelously mundane. His sign off in this speech, after all the sincere and holy benedictions: ""Thanks for taking the time to listen. Look forward to seeing you."" Slap the lectern, put on the mask and walk away. I'm not sure why, but that right there made me feel all right."
2021-03-12 14:10:02,Nice goal for those who have been cocooned in their house. I do know any people who have not met in groups and done stuff. I live in a resort area where 6 bedrooms is slumming and 10  is the norm. Biggest year ever for occupancy tax.
2021-03-12 15:25:51,"President Biden’s prime time address to the nation was a hit out of the ball Park on so many levels.

Competency: Joe knows how to lead, set realistic targets and deliver or beat those targets. I believe him when he says by the 4th of July we will be free from this pandemic.

Presidential: His address was very statesmanlike. He spoke eloquently, did not disparage anyone, and applauded the progress made to date. He is setting a new standard for future presidents to emulate.

Can-Do-Attitude: I’m constantly marveling at his ability to rally his government and get things through congress. Further proof will be when/if he can get the rest of his agenda passed too.

Diplomacy: I believe he has personally called or communicated with most world leaders, setting the stage for making America great again.

I am very optimistic and hopeful today knowing Joe is in charge."
2021-03-12 15:33:58,"Democrats are the reason we cannot have unity.  If Democrats would just accept the minority party's agenda of limited voting rights and the consequences that follow, revisionist mythology and call it history and reality, we could have unity.  If Democrats would accept that unity means bowing to the myriad toxins of the republican ideology, we could have unity.  But they stubbornly insist on this ""we the people"" idealism, and have a mistaken faith that good government will attract voters in the republican party."
2021-03-12 15:39:52,"President Biden’s address to the nation was a ray of light in our darkness.  His empathy and sincerity was in stark contrast with his predecessor. While he spoke to the entire nation, I doubt that the diehard Trump supporters even tuned in. Those who did not vote for President Biden and did watch him, probably came away with a totally different perspective.  It is likely Trump supporters were enraged that President Biden had the gumption to suggest when Americans can celebrate with family.  When First Lady Michelle Obama was promoting healthier eating, I had a colleague who was incensed that the government was telling families what to feed their children.  I found it baffling then, and I find the Trump 2020 flags that still fly in my neighborhood equally puzzling.  President Biden needs to continue forward quickly and boldly before the 2022 elections. Godspeed, President Biden!"
2021-03-12 15:37:06,"The moment the president leaned toward the camera and implored “I need you,” I felt the emotional tug of true hope. He got to me. He nailed it. This is all hands on deck, and the bright shore is within view."
2021-03-12 14:12:40,Nice to see competence and Leadership in charge in Washington. It's been sorely missed these last few years.
2021-03-12 15:16:23,"""President Barack Obama never succeeded in building durable popular support for a similar stimulus bill and allowed Republicans to define it on their terms, fueling a partisan backlash and the rise of the Tea Party movement.""

I hope we can now all learn the lesson that nominating an inexperienced newbie over a seasoned professional, no matter how hopeful, intelligent, and oratorically gifted, was not the best move."
2021-03-12 15:53:12,"""Government"" has always been an impediment to Republicans and a source of accomplishment for Democrats. e.g. During 4 years of Trump/McConnell despite calls for ""Repeal and Replace"" they did absolutely nothing to make health care for all Americans an affordable part of everyone's life. Republicans talk about what's wrong with government. But when they have the political power they do nothing of value for the citizens who gave them their political power."
2021-03-12 14:48:30,"Refreshing to hear a POTUS not mention or praise himself for a change. This speech was about us, the American people, and what we can do together as a country. It was not a speech that sowed division, lambasted opponents, or spoke of how great he was. No, it was a speech given by an adult, for adults.

In 23 minutes, President Biden did more to help stop the pandemic than the former POTUS did(n't) do in 18 months. The world has seen what true leadership is. What character is all about. The world now knows that America is on its way back from the darkness that enveloped us for 4 years.

I cannot tell how proud I am to call President Biden my president."
2021-03-12 15:17:09,"If Biden wanted to step up a notch, he would have given a slight nod to the previous administration for prioritizing and funding vaccine development.  

The Biden administration also seems to gloss over small businesses, favoring big spending through government and institutional apparatus.  It’s easier to send employees checks than buoy small businesses...which ultimately gives Amazon and other big companies another boost."
2021-03-12 14:54:53,"Yes, he tells us there is hope IF citizens will help to avoid another surge by adhering to the CDC guidelines.  There is a sizeable group, led by certain politicians, that will defy them either through Party loyalty or selfishness.  I am not talking about those who have to work unvaccinated.  It is a BIG if."
2021-03-12 14:36:25,"This is what hope feels like. This is what decency and respect look like. This what leadership is.

President Biden won't get everything right, and it's guaranteed that he'll anger some of the people, some of the time. But forward motion, attending to the needs of the many instead of the pocketbooks of the few, and understanding that the vast majority of people in the country want little more than to be able to live their lives in peace with dignity... these are the things we want from our leaders."
2021-03-12 14:53:30,"My goal:
Everyone takes heed and our band finally gets to perform in front of about 25,000 good folks at Moondance Jam in Minnesota, on a wonderful Summer's Eve.
Like we were set to do last year.
Rock On!"
2021-03-12 16:22:50,"President Biden's speech was more than soothing words for the nation.  Yesterday, I witnessed the President's words in action.  I had my first vaccination at the United Center Mass Vaccination Site in Chicago.  The operation was being run flawlessly by the U.S. Army’s 101st Airborne Division, composed of 200 soldiers from the light infantry division known commonly as the “Screaming Eagles.""   I felt immense pride and gratitude in seeing these soldiers defending the nation against COVID with such dedication and respect. I also saw what the President has brought to bear in the fight against the pandemic.   I didn't expect to feel such strong emotions about getting vaccinated, but the experience reminded me what can be achieved when we have a qualified President with a good heart in office."
2021-03-12 14:39:52,"I have to confess that I'm slightly bemused to be receiving the stimulus payments (while very grateful) since my I've also thankfully kept my job (50K/year), and been granted two months' free rent (unasked!) as an inducement not to desert my building, as many have. I don't ""need more"" (although I limit my aspirations to supporting myself and a cat, and have roommates at 36 . . .). I'm trying to make free with spending locally--without making habits I can't afford in the long run!"
2021-03-12 14:51:31,"We thank the Lord for enabling our country to reverse course and move in the right direction after this most catastrophic year. And in retrospect it all mostly comes down to leadership; at the scientific level and the political level. The time wasted at the beginning of the crises blaming others and grandstanding at every turn, only prolonged the pain and increased the death of Americans."
2021-03-12 14:26:56,"Trump's plan was to provide vaccine to everybody and bring normalcy by April. It will happen whether Biden wants it or not.  In states like FL and TX, it has already happened. He may want to keep American people gloomy and masked, but we are not following him. ""Super"" leaders like Cuomo and Newsom who have been exposed and in trouble now may want to follow Biden, and may want to keep their people gloom and doom for a while. 

Republicans are opening their states, as a result, economy and jobs are improving. Biden calls them Neanderthal, but takes credit for improved economy and employment. Biden and Kamala created mistrust in people for the covid vaccine, but they are taking credit for the vaccine. NYT pundits are working overtime to depict Biden as the savior, though Biden is asking ""where am I""? and ""what am I doing here""?"
2021-03-12 14:40:22,"So normalcy returns July 4 in the form or celebrating with close family Independence Day.  I assume that means shooting backyard fireworks too.  That’s great unless you’re the one cooking and cleaning up afterwards.  A year of lockdown just so that now I have to go clean the barbecue?  Thanks, Joe."
2021-03-12 14:40:53,"Biden also told the nation that the pandemic ""was met by silence"" from the Trump administration, which is a lie. 

Trump announced the formation of a corona virus task force during the state of the union address on Feb. 4, 2020, before most Americans had even heard of the corona virus. The Democratic response? Pelosi tore up Trump's speech and told people to ignore warnings about the pandemic and visit Chinatown in San Francisco. 

Trump banned travel from China on January 31, 2020 in an effort to stop the virus from spreading to the US. Trump banned travel from Europe at the beginning of March 2020. 

On February 26, 2020 Trump appointed Vice President Mike Pence to lead the corona virus task force, which held daily press briefings with Dr. Anthony Fauci and Dr. Deborah Birx, and often with Trump. In March 2020 Trump agreed to shut down much of the economy at the urging of Fauci and Birx, to ""flatten the curve"" of the virus spread. The economy was shut down for several months, with some states opting to continue shutdowns indefinitely. 

Trump also authorized use of hospital ships in New York and Los Angeles to help with treatment of patients, and he ordered the Army Corps of Engineers to construct makeshift hospitals in New York to treat more patients. Trump  authorized the Defense Production Act to force companies to manufacture ventilators. And Trump launched ""Operation Warp Speed"" to accelerate production of the vaccines that are now saving millions of lives. 

Silence?"
2021-03-12 15:20:13,"I was driving home when President Biden delivered his speech &  stayed in my car until he was finished. I wanted to hear him. I trust him and found his speech to be honest and straightforward. Unlike trump, who I couldn't stand watching or listening, I always turned off his lies."
2021-03-12 14:58:27,Someone needs to tell him he's not the National Pastor.
2021-03-12 14:36:38,"It's a brilliant idea if his administration and the nation can hit this deadline.  Everyone at every celebration will say or think a word of thanks to our president on that day.  It will be Biden's Fourth of July, acknowledged by a grateful nation."
2021-03-12 14:08:34,"Finally! A real leader who is compassion, honest, and humble. He’s the Trump anti-dope. Unfortunately, I fear that with all the “Neanderthal thinking” by Southern, red state governors like Greg Abbott in Texas unwilling to wait until July 4 to unmask and reopen, and with one of the nation’s lowest vaccination rates that we’ll see another deadly surge of COVID-19 variant. Too bad we don’t have a vaccine against such reckless endangerment of the public health. We do have a law against it, however, and perhaps new Attorney General, Merrick Garland, should sue Abbott and others for their criminal reckless endangerment of federal employees and U.S. military personnel stationed in those states. After one of the worst and certainly the most deadly years in American history, there should be “zero tolerance” for such criminal negligence."
2021-03-12 14:23:33,"In the past 50 days President Biden has been working hard for all Americans, not just his base, as 45 had done throughout his one term. NO Republicans voted for this bill, but have returned to their home states where they are telling small business owners this stimulus is a win for them. But then they appear of Faux news to claim this bill is a return to feeding the liberal swamp. One would have to be deaf, dumb and blind to not clearly comprehend Republican hypocrisy of: when Democrats pass a stimulus it's swamp activity, but when Republicans had done it it was patriotism. Now Republicans are telling Americans in their state not to get vaccinated from Covid. Those Republicans are playing their self serving partisanship at the cost of all American's wellbeing and the country's future. Deplorable? You betcha!"
2021-03-12 16:37:11,"Well after a couple of months of COMMON SENSE and TRUTH telling in the White House again; it is Amazing how things have all of a sudden gotten a lot better for All Americans under Joe Biden`s stewardship; after 4 miserable years of BOZO the Clown. The last year alone should cement the FAILED legacy of Trump; after the ""Devastating Year"" affixed to this title. It has been devastating; NOT that they would admit to failures of Republicans across the board who did cartwheels trying to distract from their sorry pathetic failures. NOW they want everyone to ""just forget"" all that. They can NOW fix things. YEAH RIGHT. Meanwhile Joe Biden looks like a latter day F.D.R. in producing the kind of  bold new program that conservatives go running to the hills to avoid. F.D.R. would approve hands down. Neanderthals not so much. So Biden continues to move forward with confidence and optimism. Two traits completely missing from the Trump years. Amazing how the G.O.P. on the one hand fight against ANY HELP; but then break an arm patting themselves on the back for benefits they had nothing to do with?! But then again hypocrisy and Republicans go hand in hand these days. Another 2 years of Biden undoing the horrible damage inflicted by Trump; and one wonders if the Republican (DO NOTHING) Party will even exist anymore. Hopefully NOT."
2021-03-12 12:12:19,I ain't waiting 'til the Fourth of July to celebrate! I plan to celebrate March 17th in the back room of my local Irish bar !
2021-03-12 13:03:15,Truly grateful and relieved that Biden is in charge.
2021-03-12 13:09:14,I loved Biden’s “I need you” line. It reminded me of that I Want You Uncle Sam poster. Very powerful message.
2021-03-12 12:04:34,"I don’t always agree with some of President Biden’s ideas and policies. Yet, I believe that he thinks things through and that his heart is in the right place. This article brings that home to me. The guy is doing whatever he can to get all of us on the right footing again, especially with respect to Covid. Biden seems to understand the physical and emotional destruction that the pandemic has wrought.
The other guy, the former guy had no clue about such things. If he did, he simply didn’t give a darn."
2021-03-12 12:50:43,It’s just plain nice to have a real president back in the White House. These￼￼￼ disastrous￼ past four years will serve as a reminder that you get what you vote for. As well as how the republicans are party players only and do not care of the American people.
2021-03-12 14:34:10,"FINALLY - once again there is a president in the White House who's words, actions, and decisions can be trusted."
2021-03-12 13:19:10,"That speech was nothing to write home about.  As Biden harnessed all his mental acuity to read the teleprompter, he seemed to be talking about a different universe.  Who is waiting until July 4th to meet friends in their backyard?  75% of the country, if not more, are already doing this as cases and hospitalizations have plummeted.  The CDC has already advised on the safety of outdoor gatherings for some time now.  Even Biden's vaunted yet toothless 100 day mask mandate expires in April.  All his comments on Covid were out of touch, and his ""empty chair at the table and lost relatives"" empathy routine has gone stale."
2021-03-12 14:08:31,"Dear America,

Please pay attention to what President Biden is doing for you. Then recall what President Trump didn't do for you.  

We in Canada were very happy to see that sufficient numbers of you decided to elect a sane, rational and caring president.  With  President Biden and Vice-President Harris, and their team of actual professionals, you will likely come out of the darkness spread by Trump.  You will get vaccinated and be able to return to normal.  

Trump was doing nothing to help you. His only plan was to let COVID run rampant and then whoever survived he would ask them to contribute to his re-election and defence fund.  What a guy!  

So, continue to listen to President Biden and Vice-President Harris and the highly competent experts that they have working with them and do what they ask. They are actually working to save lives.  Unlike that other guy who did nothing."
2021-03-12 12:27:50,"Of course there's hope because Trump lost, but let's let him squirm awhile."
2021-03-12 14:11:39,I wish I like most everyone else could say what I will do the day we return to normalcy but Covid and cancer took my wife and there is nothing I could do on normalcy day that will take away that great sorrow for the emptiness of my life will not change and all I can do that day is lament her loss.
2021-03-12 13:42:26,"So maybe, if we’re really good, the government will allow us to meet in small groups by the 4th of July?  Is this really America in 2021. This guy has no clue, people have been doing that all along. What is happening in this country?"
2021-03-12 15:27:15,I suddenly have this sense of being cared for as Donald Trump gets further and further away in my mind.
2021-03-12 12:23:20,"Lol This is already happening for so many people. The CDC essentially said it’s okay to meet in small settings outdoors, 

You are not going to stop people from living their lives once we have mass vaccination. It’s just not going to happen."
2021-03-12 13:32:13,"If Biden wanted to inspire confidence in the American people, he would answer questions in an open press conference. Much of his speech was a repeat of the address that he gave on recognizing the 500,000 that had died from COVID-19. Admonishing his audience to wear masks while allowing open access through the southern boarder rings hollow. Remember, the numbers that you see on the crossings represent apprehensions...we have no idea how many are coming in who are not apprehended."
2021-03-12 13:26:21,A little candor gets a long way.
2021-03-12 15:27:20,"The single most important lesson for Biden from Obama’s presidency right now is that when you do manage to do something big like Obamacare or this relief bill, even if it’s somewhat flawed — especially when it’s somewhat flawed! — you cannot then sit back and wait for people to figure out whom to credit. You must go out there and sell it, own the narrative, barnstorm the nation. Obama never had the stomach for those sorts of politics and I don’t blame him, it’s a sordid business, but it’s the only game in town. 

Otherwise the same Republican hypocrites who voted against the bill will be back in their districts claiming credit for those checks, and no one will so much as bat an eye. Trump has conditioned their voters to accept almost any amount of mendacity. Biden has to somehow grab their eyes and ears, then make it count."
2021-03-12 14:32:14,Democrats have to keep reminding voters that no Republicans voted for this bill.
2021-03-12 16:32:37,"51 days and no press conference from Joe Biden. Why not?  I thought last night he was going to answer questions from the press but when a reporter asked him one he quickly walked away.￼ Is it going to be a typical Biden presidency where he avoids the press entirely?  

I guess it is a way to play it safe but it is really unfair to the American people who want to hear directly from the president through the press.￼  President Trump held many press conferences and never hesitated taking the reporters questions. This is where President Trump shined.￼ 

This is typical of the way Joe Biden conducted his campaign and it worked then but it will not work now. He can only avoid the press for so long and sooner or later he will have to face them and answer questions. Why is he afraid?  The questions will be of an easy nature but maybe any question at this moment is too difficult for Joe Biden to tackle.￼ ￼￼"
2021-03-12 13:07:11,"I’d forgotten what presidential leadership looks like after four years of ineptitude at the hands of the creepy ‘former guy.’ President Biden has instilled a sense of dignity to the office again, an understanding of the issues confronting America in the time of pandemic, and has seemingly made all the right decisions in marshaling the resources of the federal government to vanquish the virus and vaccinate all Americans.

Regardless of what political persuasion anyone aligns with, you have to admit: Joe Biden is the right president for these times. We’re so fortunate to have him!"
2021-03-12 14:03:16,"He can still read from a teleprompter. That's great.
When will he start answering questions from the press?"
2021-03-12 14:25:52,The speech was a yawn.  I am still trying to figure out why anyone voted for this man.  47 years and nothing to show for it.  Bragging about a $1.9 TRILLION Blue State bailout dubbed as Covid relief is dishonest.  History will look back on this as a dark day in America.  The 9% Covid relief in the new law I support...the 91% bailout...ridiculous.
2021-03-12 14:39:56,Let me know when they take down the razor fencing around DC.  Let me know when the thousands of armed troops go home.  It's almost like they don't believe in their own legitimacy.
2021-03-12 14:42:41,We don’t need Biden’s permission to gather and the veiled threats to shutdown society.
2021-03-12 16:31:34,With Trump’s vaccine. LOL still trying to dismantle Trump’s band wagon.
2021-03-12 12:49:10,"Joe Biden is a human being. He is fallible. He has done and will continue to do stupid things, just as we all have, but dear God in heaven I thank him for this:

“We need to remember the government isn’t some foreign force in a distant capital. It’s us, all of us.”"
2021-03-12 13:00:50,Polling Schmolling! Joe needs to do what is right for America. The big lobby money will keep the GQP from supporting anything that benefits anybody but the wealthy.
2021-03-12 14:12:20,"After the speech, in which the President told us the hopeful news that we could be with family on the 4th of July, I flipped over to Fox, where Tucker Carlson was saying ... How DARE he tell me who I can and cannot celebrate Independence Day with. ... 
So it goes."
2021-03-12 12:07:30,Scientists are giving dire warnings about variants yet Biden is painting rosy pictures of schools reopening and large gatherings in just a few months. Turns out liberals don’t believe in science they just want someone who makes them feel good
2021-03-12 15:14:38,Hooray BIPARTISAN President who is an ADULT. Thank you heavens!! It feels good not to have someone who wants you to hate your neighbor. It’s beautiful!
2021-03-12 12:55:52,"But what if one's close family are a pack of Lawn Guyland Covid-denying Trumpists? Didn't think of that, didja, Joe?"
2021-03-12 13:50:32,I've missed having a president who can speak in complete sentences and be able to pronounce multi-syllabic words!
2021-03-12 14:28:18,'Hope' was the operative word in President Biden's address last evening. It's a term that never crossed my mind during the regime of 'the former guy.'
2021-03-12 12:18:46,@Common Sense (??). I’ll take sleepy speeches over calls for overthrowing the government. I’ll take schlocky sentiment over hate speech. I’ll take an experienced and empathetic leader over a narcissistic grifter. Anyday. And even though you’ll benefit from this bill - either directly or indirectly - you’d rather choke on it. This is the problem with the GOP.
2021-03-12 13:48:35,"After 4 years of a raving lunatic, we get Joe Biden.  My husband's hands stopped trembling.  And my jaw was no longer clenched tight like it's been for 4 years.  Listening to Joe Biden last night was beyond hopeful.  It felt like America has been lost and finally found its way home.  What a relief."
2021-03-12 14:12:51,"Notice how no reporters had to ruin their credibility with stories about how President Biden ""just became presidential"" in his speech, because he has been presidential from even before January 20?"
2021-03-12 17:13:59,"I hope to see many re-runs of McConnell saying ""not a single Republican voted for this bill"" in the run up to the 2020 midterm election.  The add for Democratic house and senate candidates practically writes itself.  ""The Republicans don't care about you, the little guy,  they only care about tax cuts for the rich"""
2021-03-12 17:12:38,Compare two signature legislative initiatives: Trump's tax cuts and Biden's rescue bill. Trump's tax cut overwhelmingly benefited the top 20 percent; The biggest benefits of the Biden bill go to the bottom 40 percent of income earners. Biden not only delivered on his promise but gained the support of 63 percent of lower income Republican voters. That could be very significant in further splintering the Republican party.
2021-03-12 18:05:28,"And Texas sues Austin for being safe. GOP looking at big tent, lotsa empty seats."
2021-03-12 19:21:54,"the dementia really seems to be advancing quite rapidly, President Harris by summer."
2021-03-12 19:56:34,"One good side effect listening to Biden speak, instant drowsiness, asleep while he still dishes out his Schmalz about uniting while he has done everything except that. The southern border is a disaster quickly becoming a catastrophe for the American people."
2021-03-12 20:23:44,"Yes, there is hope that the Republicans will sweep the midterms!"
2021-03-12 21:21:27,"We can only hope. We've been lied to so much. It sure sounds like we're on the right track. 

Having so many vaccines with a far more equitable distribution available than we have had in Florida will be a game changer. Imagine, soon 80 year olds may be able to call up their doctor or pharmacist and make an appointment, instead of registering for dozens of lotteries, playing fastest finger hunger games with websites while competing against seniors from the whole state....public health departments will have a predictable amount available....just like a civilized country again. 

And the Governor of Florida will have to smile and get out of the way and claim credit. Instead, he now complains and blusters and threatens. 

Justice is coming. Fairness is coming."
2021-03-12 20:37:43,"One of the most moving things President Biden said last night was his reminder that our government is an extension of us. With this bill, we members of the public are helping each other. We have to take the same approach to mask wearing and social distancing and mutual support, in this, the final stretch of our painful marathon, when we need each other more than ever.

Meanwhile, Mitch McConnell treats the American public like a bunch of dopes to be scammed. Last night on the PBS Newshour he said that 100% Republican votes against the economic rescue bill was proof that it's no good. Even putting aside that 70 percent of Americans think the opposite, the truth is that 100 percent Republican votes against the bill proves only that their bloc has become a mindless engine of political destruction. Mr. McConnell and his drones crush all national interest in their driving quest to score points in inter-party tug-of-war. 

In Kentucky,  for God's sake, ONE QUARTER of all children live in poverty. This bill will propel huge numbers of them out of that hole in order to give them the footing, post-pandemic, for sustainable futures. And their senior senator voted No."
2021-03-12 22:27:20,"The nation is more than just exhausted from living for a year with the pandemic. We are reeling from 4 years of pain and devastation inflicted by a sociopath and supported by his obsequious legislators and misdirected base. You do not survive that malady without lingering effects. 

I have believed from the onset that President Biden is the perfect person to lead our country out from behind the assault on our democracy. He is the antithesis of the Vexatious One, (I refuse to reference that guy by name). Fortunately, President Biden is devoid of the perpetual self-absorbed ego that was on full display by the “I tweet daily” guy.  

President Biden has a laser focus on the tasks at hand. He hit the ground running which also displayed a level of preparation that has finally returned to the White House. It is also appropriate to applaud his administration who comprise a competency that has also been MIA for four years. 
 
Assuming the success of the vaccine rollout and the relief package, the next hurdle is equally formidable, the GOP's assault on voting rights.  

The GOP’s flagrant efforts to restrict voting are as anti-American as it gets. The passing of H.R. 1 is critical. Even if it means we must get rid of the filibuster.

If I could, I would like to sell the GOP a marketing jingle that would fit their behavior and accurately convey their message: “When all else fails…cheat.” I would throw in another word (lie) for an additional, albeit modest, fee."
2021-03-12 18:32:57,"How nice to hear a president talk about hope and unity instead of hate and division. I think the American Rescue Plan really is a huge win for lower and middle-income Americans, especially the expanded child tax credit and expanded health insurance subsidies. I'm glad to hear Biden and others plan to promote it. And extra kudos to Biden for urging Americans to stop scapegoating Asian-Americans."
2021-03-12 21:15:42,"I'm glad to hear that. Then states must have ready enough supply of all the approved vaccines to vaccinate all the people who want a vaccine. Some people want or need a particular vaccine. Others will take any vaccine but can't navigate the Internet or drive to a faraway site. Others can't spend all day every day clicking on multiple websites in the hopes of getting an appointment. Waiting lists, websites with more information about type of vaccine, and perhaps  some kind of centralized call center would help. Right now, if my best options are to join a social media platform and ask for help, or search across countless sites myself in the middle of the night, my chances of finding an appointment are not optimal. Biden didn't cause this mess. He inherited it, and he's doing the best he can to fix it. But there is still work to be done. Hopefully he is right, and May will be the turning point."
2021-03-12 23:30:34,"Curious if the President ever looks out of the window. All over America people are attending sporting events, dining in groups indoors, visiting loved ones, going to work and in general trying to get their lives back. And Mr Biden believes we may be able to meet outdoors in small groups by July?"
2021-03-11 12:16:35,"A whole new way of viewing work time and place was introduced last March, when many of us started working remotely.

To be fair, I've worked in the same place for 19 years now, and there are many in the hierarchy whose names are familiar, but I've never met in person.

I particularly liked how the Times used examples of employees experiencing first-hand some of the weather events we've all been following. Somehow, it is reassuring to know members of this administration are right there in the thick of it."
2021-03-11 12:23:35,"Re: When Your West Wing Job Is Really, Really Far From the Oval Office
A pandemic plus is evident in this article about a remote West Wing.
Spreading the top observers and decision advisors out among us provides a double duty benefit; we the public can see and provide living data as input to the administration and the administration has tangible, even emotional, experience to influence them and guide policy.
I suggest if the system works, don’t break it."
2021-03-11 12:38:48,"I think it’s a major silver lining that so many people making policy and implementing decisions that affect us all are living among the rest of us while they take on those roles. Ironically, that harks back to the original 18th century concept of the people’s representatives having lives that were independent of the capital. The Biden administration has a huge opportunity here to “get to know the neighbors” and the neighborhoods before returning to the DC bubble — living the local experience, building local community relationships, and taking the case for their policies directly to the people when it’s safe to do so. I hope they make the most of it."
2021-03-11 12:57:40,It seems to me this type of work scenario should remain in place. It's far too easy to move to Washington and be completely out of touch with what's really going on around the country.
2021-03-11 13:31:11,"This is a very cool article and good to see.  Our single daughter works remotely and has a 8 month old baby.  We are her ""covid"" childcare and have been since her daughter was born in July.  It is an adjustment to our lives but we feel that this is the safest and best way for our daughter and granddaughter to live right now.  Hopefully with Biden in the White House we will see the light at the end of the tunnel sooner rather than later but we are glad to be able to help her and spend time with our granddaughter."
2021-03-11 13:16:29,"I’m glad Biden and his staff understand that it is the virus who sets the timeline. 

As a public servant myself, I’m still not comfortable going back to the office, and I won’t be until vaccination rates increase substantially."
2021-03-11 14:08:44,"By working outside the Wshington/NYC bubble, hopefully more staff will work with a far better sense of reality for the rest of the country."
2021-03-11 14:27:05,Very creative and appears effective. Trump basically required everyone to be present so they can fawn over him and he could catch them doing anything he doesn’t like. Just sayin’
2021-03-11 14:33:45,"I like this remote working model. Hope it stays. It could be seen as a more efficient way to know exactly what’s going on in our neighborhoods but allow a faster, more direct way to Washington, D.C.

Get rid of the hubris, get stuff done!"
2021-03-11 14:54:18,"The flip side of this is that, without face-to-face encounters with legislators, especially GOP ones, Biden administration personnel may not benefit from the nuanced relationships that come from personal contact. These particular employees are probably not in schmooze-type positions, but others are. Bipartisanship may be a lost cause, but maybe behind closed doors, there can be a bit of cooperation."
2021-03-11 15:16:12,"The technology and capabilities to work remotely have been in place in the Business segment for 20 years. It's about time the government caught up with it for day to day operations!

Remote working will likely save the taxpayers gazillions of dollars in travel and hotel fees alone.  Using secure remote internet connections and encrypted delivery mechanisms sensitive information is probably more secure simultaneously (think stolen laptops, lazily discarded documents, overheard airport conversations, etc).

Remote working is one example of how the business sector has been using technology to SAVE themselves money, not waste it with travel. I have worked remotely for almost 20 years and it is great!"
2021-03-11 14:59:40,"Not to sound paranoid, but that home office set up does not appear very secure. Given the number of foreign powers trying to hack into the top branches of our government, I would have hoped to see some more secure a network than wifi and two cellphones."
2021-03-11 14:44:16,"If anyone's workplace tries to force them to come back in, you can point to this article as proof as to why you don't need to. If the President is allowing his staff to WFH, so should your boss."
2021-03-11 14:56:20,This Administration is amazing.
2021-03-11 15:17:29,"Adaptability is key. One does what is necessary in extraordinary times. Yes the remote staffers may be missing out of some face to face relationships in DC, but have found a way to get the job done for now. Being outside the Bubble can reap benefits too. Connecting with the real world keeps their Boss better connected as well. It's early days. Commonsense will dictate if and when a move is needed."
2021-03-11 15:58:20,I have felt the need to disseminate Washington DC for years. Representatives and even government officials should live with those that they represent. There are ways of securing communication lines and offices. If the goal is a representative government knowing the people would be a great step: living amongst them is crucial.
2021-03-11 15:59:43,"For all the misery and death this virus has caused, we have been learning and adapting. There will be more epidemics in the future and we will be - or ought to be - far better prepared. 

This story illustrates the transformative effect technology is going to have. And what we are using now - like Zoom - is primitive compared to what will be done with virtual reality and 5G speed. The experience of doing office work remotely will become more and more like being there.

But the big changes ahead won't just affect knowledge workers. 

Each week a truck stops at the curb beside my house. The driver operates a device that picks up the trash bin and empties it into the truck. That used to require a second worker. How long before the truck arrives without a human driver?

A couple of weeks ago I watched a Boston Dynamics video of robots doing a dance routine, including backflips. 7 or 8 years back, getting one to climb a few steps and turn a doorknob was a really big deal. It's hard to anticipate the effect automation will have, even on physical work that today requires a human on site. 

We seem to be at a tipping point for technology and how we work. Only business leaders and politicians who are ready to adapt to reality, rather than wasting their time on fantasy and culture wars will be of any use."
2021-03-11 17:04:16,"Finally visited Mexico City a couple of years ago. Went up to Chapultepec and beheld the glorious Valley of Mexico from the ramparts, and imagined what it would have been like for high government officials like Porfirio Diaz to behold that view for years. And I wondered as I stood there whether that expansive but still limited view played an indirect role over time in sowing the seeds of eventual revolution.

Having some relatively high government officials working remotely from around the country sounds like a good idea to me so long as they keep information and communications secure from hackers."

The unemployment results not being materially different from the national average I think demonstrate that there were no perfect economic outcomes, but if they're going to be similar, choosing the one with fewer dead people is the right one."
2021-03-11 14:21:10,"Notes to the country from Seattle:
1. Science works.
2. Experts are experts for a reason.
3. Do it for others, not yourself.
4. Be safe."
2021-03-11 14:17:40,It boils down to human decency. Something we are truly lacking in Florida. Congratulations Seattle. I miss you.
2021-03-11 14:23:24,"It's a shame that more communities didn't follow the Seattle metro area's path. The potential saving of 300,000 lives is to me, a worthy goal. Even if following the example would have saved 30,000 lives rather than 300,000 it would have been worth the sacrifices."
2021-03-11 14:33:50,"I’m so proud of my city and all of my neighbors, near and far. I’ve never loved you more, Seattle, and I’m here to help re-build better and stronger, for all of us."
2021-03-11 14:44:30,"Seattle has a few demographic anomalies compared to other major metro areas that likely contributed to its outcome, outside of any lockdown decisions.  It's among the whitest, healthiest (most active, least obese) and most highly educated of major cities.  It has a lower percentage of >65 year olds than the country.  It's not known for density and multi-generational housing in cramped quarters (75% of the city is single family homes).  There is little public transit where large populations mix on a daily basis.  A substantial portion of the workforce in the city are tech workers who can and have easily worked from home.  

So I think the question if Seattle's outcome would have been similar, even without such a severe lockdown, that seems almost excessive relative to number of cases/deaths (e.g. schools have been 100% remote for over a year, even for the  youngest kids/most-at-risk - the most restricted in the country)."
2021-03-11 14:52:16,It has been a long and dreary year. But yesterday I hugged my fully vaccinated mother-in-law. I can’t even imagine our kids having to endure their grandmother be alone in the hospital—or worse. It’s been worth it. We grieve for the many who were lost and their loved ones.
2021-03-11 14:54:55,"Not mentioned is that there has also been very little pushback about mask wearing here, in the metro area, at least. People have been serious about at least doing their best at complying with public health recommendations and it shows."
2021-03-11 14:55:26,"One might add that Seattleites are not the most social of persons and they are often very comfortable interacting with their computers.  That said, the forced isolation of the pandemic may have produced, even in them, a strong desire to interact in person with friends and family.   The pandemic has been devastating for the downtown.  Homelessness has escalated to unprecedented heights, and tents are a common sight on the sidewalks.  It is very sad to see a city, once so vibrant and bustling, this devoid of people.  I have no rosy prognostications, but perhaps the giant stimulus bill will help the city to revive."
2021-03-11 14:57:29,"Have to say that throughout the pandemic, there’s been nowhere else in America is rather have been than here in Seattle.

I still think we could have acted earlier, as the virus was circulating well before our lockdowns started, but compared to other places, folks have been cooperative and government has been rational, and that helps a lot."
2021-03-11 14:58:25,"I am pleased to see the coverage of a city I love so much. But reading this article today is bittersweet, as this date marks the one year anniversary of Seattle public school lockdowns due to the pandemic. As I write, plans to send the youngest students back into the classroom keep getting delayed, and there are no plans publicly available about the District’s efforts to get grades 2-12 back in the classrooms. Many are concerned that those ages will not see the inside of a physical classroom until September—a total of 18 months without in-person education. The looming mental health crisis for children and young people so long denied in-person contact with teachers and peers worries me deeply."
2021-03-11 14:58:21,"Last year on this day my daughter's schools closed for ""2 weeks"" and they are still closed for most students in her age group. Her siblings' colleges went remote and have stayed that way. I am so thankful that we live in Washington and were able to save lives and I support these school closures. Let the mass vaccinations begin so we life can open up again! We are ready to do it if it can be done SAFELY."
2021-03-11 14:59:04,"This was a great article with one major missing component. Despite all of this success, Seattle Public Schools are still indefinitely closed. There is no plan for reopening for the vast majority of children in grades K-12, and most parents assume that schools will not be open full-time in the fall. We did a great job at averting deaths - which is clearly the primary goal - but we are now neglecting tens of thousands of children indefinitely."
2021-03-11 15:00:36,"Seattle public schools were one of the earliest to close and still aren’t open, despite some of the lowest COVID numbers in the country.  Today is the one year anniversary of schools closing.  The governor prioritized staff and teachers for vaccinations and yet the teachers’ union still refuses to return to in-person teaching.  So science may carry the day in some aspects of local governance, but fear is currently winning in local schools.  And our kids are suffering."
2021-03-11 15:08:48,"Great that Seattle is a case study that highlights how good protective strategies can work.  But wow,  Inslee doesn't get much credit here.  Throughout this pandemic, he pushed very hard to keep things safe, including masks, social distancing and closures of restaurants and other large gatherings.   Many people in the red areas of WA as well as the scant but vocal numbers of Republicans in the Seattle area gave him a lot of grief.  This article makes it sound like all he did was listen to some health experts who I have never heard of.  Inslee deserves a lot of credit for this success and for standing tough in the face of the strange opposition we have seen to masks and protective measures.  The article ends with quotes from Mayor Durkin, who none of us living in the PNW have heard from in months since the failed efforts to bring an end to the riots and the disastrous negotiations with the police chief.  Perhaps a follow up article is in order."
2021-03-11 15:10:00,"The lockdown made it obvious how much pollution cars contribute. The air has been so clean, and you can see the mountains so much more frequently. The lower traffic has been lovely.  
Seattle has a reputation for being ""unfriendly,"" mostly among people who've moved here from elsewhere. However, this area has complied with mask wearing, social distancing, etc. very well, so we're just ""friendly at a distance."""
2021-03-11 15:10:41,"A large number of us in Seattle disliked our mayor; we even had a recall campaign this summer. But when she announced restrictions we mostly all complied, because we knew the restrictions did not come from her. Our government simply followed the textbook, none of our politicians used the pandemic as an opportunity to grandstand and get more media coverage for themselves. They let public health officials do their jobs. Consequently we got consistent messaging, which all the research shows increases compliance. For Thanksgiving, I heard a public service announcement telling me to not gather multiple times per day on every kind media I consume - podcasts, YouTube, TV. It is not just “personal responsibility” or some special magic that led to fewer super spreader Thanksgiving dinners. People outside or inside looking for reasons that Seattleites are somehow better or somehow different or special are looking in vain. The difference was simply our leaders just did what any pandemic playbook would tell you to: be consistent, be realistic, and don’t be the face of it."
2021-03-11 14:59:14,"A lot of politicians argued that the economy, and the opportunity to work and make money, were more important than public health.  
Well, if someone you know died during the pandemic, they lost everything they ever had, and everything they were ever going to have. 
We should have been focused on keeping people alive, not on ignoring science for the sake of individual liberty."
2021-03-11 14:45:48,"A good hard national lockdown following the Washington state model would have been the way to go. Look at China. Even if you think they created this virus, what they did afterwards is just right. It is political death for any politician or business to praise them for anything no matter how small. Because of this, we don't talk about it, not even in the pages of this paper.

Kudos to the Washingtonians."
2021-03-11 15:03:44,"The San Francisco Bay Area and Seattle have taken the same precautions and have nearly the same low death rates. That is reflected in the chart. Yet the article treats California as a single place and does not call out the Bay Area's success. The Bay Area and Seattle have similar workforces with relatively higher numbers of people working from home. The article also slights the mayor of San Francisco, which seems gratuitous. The Times should clarify whether there are regional differences in California."
2021-03-11 15:11:36,"Even so, the NYT reports that King County is high risk for Covid-19 today. I know that King County is more than Seattle, as I live on an island in Puget Sound and it is part of unincorporated King County. Here, on Vashon Island, a population of around 11,000, we have 108 total cases since last year and as of today, 97% of our seniors (Vashon's population is mostly 55+) have been vaccinated. We are all doing our part and I'm grateful I live in a place where people actually care about each other."
2021-03-11 15:06:16,"Now that teachers are being vaccinated let’s get schools open, keep them open this summer, and be number one in educating our kids."
2021-03-11 14:46:51,A lot of causality issues that need to be examined before this conclusion is reached.   And quoting the experts whose recommendations were followed does little to prove the thesis.
2021-03-11 14:56:59,"These types of ""what could have been"" conclusions are unhelpful speculation.  NY and NYC were under very intrusive restrictions for a long time and we did worse than Florida."
2021-03-11 14:31:02,"This is difficult to say but those in power who were irresponsible regarding this pandemic are, in affect, guilty of manslaughter. The article suggested that 300,000 people might not have died if a unified message has been sent from the President and from State  leaders. The manslaughter continues in some states."
2021-03-11 15:00:52,"One thing you briefly touched on that probably deserves more investigation is that the three metro areas with the lowest death rates were Seattle, Portland, and San Francisco. Three different metros in three different states but with similar underlying demographic, political, and socioeconomic characteristics."
2021-03-11 15:05:28,"“We have so many lessons we have learned here. Unfortunately, not many people were listening.”   -  Ali Mokdad, a professor of health metrics sciences at the Seattle-based Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation

In the U.S., there is a plethora of brilliant people at medical schools, foundations, and other medical institutions.   I was stunned how feckless and silent they were during the pandemic.

Seattle had a big problem.  They did a job, reacting scientifically to the epidemiological numbers in their population.

As the article states, every metropolitan area is different as far as population demographics, the dynamics of industry, etc.

But could not have the Seattle mode been used as a template to better fight the virus in big cities along the coasts, and all the U.S.?

Did not the CDC, other government agencies, and other states monitor the Seattle numbers, and say, ""Hey, these people in the Northwest have had some efficacy.""

I really thought in the middle of last year, some academic medicine person would do two things, 1) Stand up and say, ""Here are the numbers, this is the path forward;  and 2) Deliver that message in a way that the great majority of Americans would buy into it.

The Trump administration had little coordination.  There was bluster and intimidation. Trump's animus toward Washington Governor Jay Inslee was well known.

Nobody had the insight, courage and prudence to deliver the Seattle message on a national level.  I am dumbfounded."
2021-03-11 15:20:49,The San Francisco area comes very close to Seattle's success and the schools are still closed in both areas. Several commenters have suggested that this is flying in the face of science. I wonder if keeping schools closed has contributed to the low death rates. Local health officials are warning us to expect another surge in 4-6 weeks at the same time as demands for in person schools are at a peak. The tradeoffs for a low death rate have included economic pain for small businesses and service workers. Maybe distance schooling is also part of the price.
2021-03-11 15:29:04,"One of the most ironic and cruel twists of fate we had here in Seattle, was the fact that the outbreak started in a single Care Facility in Kirkland. Had the numbers been spread out over a larger area and many counties and hospitals, it might well have escaped early detection. The fact that it was so deadly in one location, immediately raised suspicion, and ultimately the correct diagnosis. Also, again by a cruel twist of fate, it garnered almost immediate buy-in by the public as it was so obvious that this disease was literally so deadly.
Not mentioned in the article was a history here in Seattle. Supposedly, the response to the deadly Flu pandemic of 1918 was also widely praised, so perhaps there was some collective memory at work as well, but clearly not as obvious as the first point."
2021-03-11 15:29:05,"In the first few weeks when testing was scarce I remember frequently talking to people with mild symptoms about why they cannot get their COVID to ease their mind because we needed to save it for someone a lot sicker. People listened and understood. 

Seattle has strong integrated family medicine model which helped us not flood our urgent care and emergency room facilities. We had drive up testing open fairly early, positives were followed up remotely and triaging the once who needed to be seen. We also were early to start telemedicine.

Some of my patients in long term care facilities had to endure months and months of strict lockdowns. It certainly has not been easy. Everyday I see the physical decline and how it had affected their mental health. But the important thing is their still here with us and now receiving vaccines and life slowly returning to some semblance of normalcy. 

In my practice I am yet to see a single person refusing to wear a mask or complain about their rights taken away.

The last year has left a toll on all of us. Shattered businesses, growing number homeless, increasing number of people with depression and anxiety tell that story. However Seattle as a community have come together by watching out for their neighbors, following the advice from public health community despite the inconveniences, believing in science and wanting to get vaccinated. That has been the silver lining."
2021-03-11 15:29:21,"It’s true, our state government and health officials did many things right and we are grateful, lucky.

But let’s not ignore some missteps.

Seattle public schools may not open this year. Families with the resources have fled the public schools in droves for private schools, where kids are getting excellent educations - in-person.  I have heard of households where both parents must work, and a 9 year old is left home alone all day with nothing but a laptop for childcare.  The full and devastating impact on poor families will not be evident for a while.

I volunteered many shifts at a mass vaccination clinic downtown this winter, entering demographics and addresses of patients who have managed to secure coveted appointments. They are almost all white and live in affluent zip codes in North Seattle, Mercer Island, the East side...

History may not be so kind."
2021-03-11 15:33:20,"I am proud to live in a city and state that has handled the pandemic so very well. I am; however, deeply troubled by the extreme resistance in our city to get our kids back into the classroom. It seems the district and more so the teachers union have forgotten those they claim to serve. Families and struggling, kids are suffering and our school board would rather spend hours talking about renaming school buildings that at this rate will likely remain empty indefinitely!  Truly a failure"
2021-03-11 15:48:42,"I too am another proud Washingtonian. As an Italian used to hugging everyone, and one who's job depended on international travel, 2020 was a massive re-adjustment, but worth it. Like many others, I found other outlets for my time, including now being part of a local project that provides homemade bread to local food pantries. Called Community Loaves (and recently featured on the Today Show), our last donation was for nearly 2,000 loaves of bread.

Rather than whine and complain about restrictions, we found outlets to help others in need. I also started a hyperlocal sourdough baking group and personally gave starter to over 20 people in my neighborhood (we did all the transfers outside, people brought their own containers). 

Everyone we know is looking forward to resuming ""normal"" life, but also willing to wait just a touch longer, as we seem now to be seeing light at the end of the tunnel."
2021-03-11 15:50:59,"Demographics, demographics, demographics. Without wanting to belittle the success and the leadership of the various political players in WA and Seattle in particular, this is a lot easier to achieve if you are dealing with a highly educated, young(ish) and rather homogenous population. Wouldn't (and didn't) work the same way in L.A., sadly."
2021-03-11 15:55:35,"This is a fine article but it only briefly mentions one crucial factor for Seattle's success. About 70% of the city is zoned for single family homes. Urbanists--including the politicians quoted in this article--have long wanted to rezone these neighborhoods, destroying their character to build more density. But having so many single family homes is one important reason why Seattle's record is so much better than other cities in the nation. There's no place like home."
2021-03-11 15:56:11,"I applaud the efforts of our citizens and the decisive action of our leadership. One glaring omission: in spite of our hard work and obvious success with keeping numbers low, our public schools are still not open, and the school district and union seem to be spending more time blaming each other than coming up with plans. It’s with a heavy heart that I realize it has been a year since schools closed here, and every day I hear more stories about the effects on the mental health of our youth. Huge cities like New York and Chicago have figured out how to open....what makes Seattle’s circumstances so special that we haven’t even agreed on a plan? Enough of kicking the can down the road."
2021-03-11 16:04:23,"Beyond responsible leadership here in Seattle we believe in science but I attribute our containment success to the fact that the vast majority of people wear masks. It is not seen as a political statement but a health issue. We have also resisted reopening large venues that are nothing more than super spreader events. Stores are well stocked with masks, gloves and disinfectant a their entry doors and abide by the ""No mask, no entry"" policy. Wear masks people, it is simple and effective."
2021-03-11 16:04:56,"The article discusses metropolitan regions, not municipalities. Does the Seattle metropolitan region have actual regional governance so that the public health measures are imposed across both the city itself and its dependent counties?

This is an important question because epidemics spread via social networks within cities and via spatial diffusion determined by travel patterns across metropolitan regions (city and counties)."
2021-03-11 16:06:01,"I find these high-level analyses of lockdowns very frustrating. I live 150 miles north of Seattle. My 3 kids have not missed a day of in person learning, businesses are open (with masking and capacity restrictions.   My family went swimming at the community centre last weekend.  

Our restrictions essentially amount to a strict limit on unmasked, indoor gatherings - basically you can’t have them with people outside your household. 

The net result has been deaths and hospitalization well below what has been experienced in Seattle. 

I don’t know why the difference, but surely it is not because we had a less stringent lockdown! It seems to me that severity of lockdown is just one of many things to consider, but it seems to be the primary focus on all the reporting. 

I hope that the final conclusions drawn by public health officials is far more nuanced than the current discussion concerning the impact of restrictions."
2021-03-11 16:08:37,"We retired to the Pacific Northwest right before the pandemic hit and are grateful to have been here.   I mostly applaud the work of Gov. Inslee.  It should be noted that at least part of the reason why downtown Seattle is still pretty ghost-like is that we had a summer and fall of destructive protests there and in the nearby Capital Hill area.    Lots of the boarded up windows and devastated small businesses and restaurants can be attributed to that.  In turn, there may be correlation between the unemployed, disengaged youth and the persistent mini-riots here in Seattle and Portland."
2021-03-11 16:09:44,"I live in downtown Seattle. It's been a hard year. Yet, I feel relatively safe. My neighbors all wear masks. Most  people out on the park paths and sidewalks wear masks or pull them up when you approach each other. People in stores all wear masks. The only place I see less compliance is at Pike Place Market - tourists from other parts of the country who think they are exempt."
2021-03-11 16:10:24,"Kudos to public officials in Seattle and Washington State for promptly taking the actions necessary to reduce the spread of COVID-19.

Would that other state officials showed equal restraint.  Here in the DC region, Maryland’s governor, Larry Hogan, has just announced the lifting of occupancy restrictions on restaurants, bars and retail establishments, although masking and social distancing requirements will remain in force and local officials may impose more stringent requirements.

I fear that the premature easing of COVID restrictions could increase community spread, even as vaccine availability increases."
2021-03-11 16:12:19,"I feel incredibly fortunate to be a resident of Seattle throughout the pandemic. We are not without problems but there are incredible resources here: a world class university and medical school, research and health care facilities, strong leaders in Gov. Inslee, Mayor Durkan and Exec. Constantine., a culture of scientific and technological advancement and literacy, and a population willing to put the community first. We have pulled together as a city and community, and saved lives. Now we have to get our downtown going again, put the same energy into helping our homeless and mentally ill, and our kids back in school. With vaccinations well under way, Seattle is on its way back."
2021-03-11 16:18:04,"So nice to see my city highlighted positively in the news. It has been a really hard year, for everyone. As many are, I’m reinventing myself after having to close a business due to the pandemic. There is opportunity here so I’m confident. We had good leadership, easily accessible and clear, consistent information from reputable sources, then followed through with shared sacrifices. It’s not been easy but I feel very fortunate living here."
2021-03-11 16:19:28,"The table shows a death rate for San Francisco (67) very similar to Seattle (64). Given the greater urban density and socio-economic and demographic diversity of San Francisco, and the complex political messaging across CA (which the article does mention), SF's experience may have been a more interesting, though perhaps more complicated, story.   Why tell Seattle's story as a kind of outlier, when San Francisco's numbers are near equal?  A comparative story of how these two metropolises shared and differed in their responses would perhaps have been more insightful."
2021-03-11 16:19:31,"I feel exactly what Michele from Seattle described. I would add that being a rather politically correct community in some respects, that quality has been a huge benefit in this big instance. Our public officials did the right thing for the right reasons."
2021-03-11 16:22:35,"Note that the numbers in the San Francisco Metro Area are close to that of Seattle’s, and we’ve had similar restrictions to theirs with mostly excellent levels of compliance. The biggest outliers I have noticed are the trades, many of whom won’t wear masks on the job."
2021-03-11 16:29:24,"Our island county north of Seattle has consistently had the lowest COVID rate in NW Washington State.  The single entry point, our ferry system, into a 15,000 person county has helped, as has the already existing culture of 'we're going to have to take care of one another, ourselves' born of the isolation and unique challenges inherent to island life.
  
And by keeping the rates low, our county's rigorous contact tracing efforts have been able to actually work.   Just recently a cluster of cases showed up but were quickly controlled by rigorous and rapid tracing along with a willingness of folks to self-isolate.  Our county-wide caseload today, knock on wood, is zero.   

While we are fully aware of the privilege and unique advantages our island community has provided us, we hope  what we've learned and have been able to do can be of inspiration to others."
2021-03-11 16:02:17,"Seattleites are very rule-following people.   I have been yelled at by fellow pedestrians for choosing to jay-walk.   (Part of why it was hilarious we were designated an ""anarchist jurisdiction"" by the previous administration. )  Sometimes this trait is very useful."
2021-03-11 16:19:40,In Seattle civil disobedience was displayed last summer at the BLM protests where the vast majority were masked.  Both wearing masks and fighting social injustice shows concern for one's neighbors and society.
2021-03-11 16:08:18,To tens of thousands of Seattle Public Schools kids who still have no idea when they'll see the inside of a classroom: thank you for your sacrifice.
2021-03-11 15:45:35,"California and the PNW did not have to deal with the D614G strain until July 2020. When that strain of the virus arrived, their experience was the same as the other East Coast states, perhaps slightly worse. The CDC's failure to detect D614G arriving from Europe in February 2020 doomed New York and was a mistake that can never be forgiven."
2021-03-11 15:55:21,"A lot of credit needs to go to our big tech citizens. Microsoft, Amazon, Google etc..... all kept their employees home early and, the local media gave those moves quite a bit of attention . This gave a lot of political cover to Jay Inslee and co. to make strict/sensible  stay at home rules. We should applaud them all."
2021-03-11 16:23:41,"I believe Chicago’s numbers were impacted by the Trump administration’s decision to ban flights from certain countries without planning for the crush of travelers coming in before the deadline. O’Hare was a mess with people crushed together, unmasked, many infected who just left the airport unrestricted. Also, O’Hare had lots of people who came in from China early on in the first few months. There wasn’t  adequate testing or screening. I believe there were restrictions on non-US citizens coming in but not on US nationals. Not sure a virus distinguishes ."
2021-03-11 16:02:46,"This article needs a shout out to Helen Chu, the Seattle flu researcher who went rogue in the best possible way and found the first case of community COVID spread. Also to Governor Inslee whose consistent messaging and thoughtful decisions were an example of top notch leadership."
2021-03-11 16:04:45,"Leadership matters.  Competence matters.  Honesty matters.  

If we’d had those three qualities present in our national government last year, rather than the abject disaster of Trump, hundreds of thousands more Americans would be alive today."
2021-03-11 16:06:48,Your Metro death rate list shows Seattle at 64 and San Francisco at 67. Both much lower than any other Metro ares. Why? You have discussed only Seattle. Why? Did both areas take similar measures? Why are they so different from all the rest?
2021-03-11 15:32:35,"I think one glaring difference between the Seattle area and East of the Mountains where the virus soared is that a critical mass of Seattle workers got to work from home. In the hard-hit Yakima Valley people had to labor in the fields and fruit packing plants. In Walla Walla, people got sick working in the meat packing plants. And they spread it around. Same old story. The situation favored the better off."
2021-03-11 16:04:39,It comes down to politics. Those states with minimalist governments had to keep businesses open as there were no alternative support services. Washington and it's Canadian neighbour British Columbia have both allowed decisions based on science to sway their actions rather than pander to the anti mask crowd.
2021-03-11 15:57:50,"Go Wa! So nice to hear that all the hardship over this last year was worth it! And I feel like we have observed a minor miracle in this day and age: politicians who made decisions based on science, and subverted their egos to present a united front. Let's get WA kids back in schools, and keep the vaccines flowing."
2021-03-11 15:59:50,"Seattle, Portland, San Francisco and Oakland combined under the umbrella of “Pacific Northwest” had the lowest death rate in the contiguous United States. Healthier populations per capita, generally well-run public programs, mostly progressive approaches to problem solving, wet weather, and a trend toward “love thy neighbor” all made the difference. It will be interesting to see how this region fares during the upcoming roaring 20s and into the future.

If only Idaho would ditch the Oath Keepers and get on board.

Plus, we have all the water."
2021-03-11 16:12:31,"""and residents who repeatedly indicated a willingness to upend their lives to save others."" Yes, that says everything about this place I call home. I love all of you."
2021-03-11 16:04:43,It’s amazing what belief in science and good leadership at the top can do! Washingtonians owe their lives to Jay Inslee and their neighbors who understood from the beginning we are all in this together.
2021-03-11 16:21:43,Seattle. Highly educated city. Steady in democratic leadership. Perhaps those characteristics also influence the low transmission rates?
2021-03-11 16:17:39,"While Seattle's measures no doubt helped, just looking at the list of other metro areas shows that other cities had significantly fewer deaths - what protocols did they follow? Or was it just the unpredictable actions of the virus? We need a better understanding of what has happened.

What IS clear is that Trump completely botched the response up, from delaying the warnings (while his cronies could take measures to save their stock portfolios), to delayed responses to the shortages of supplies and equipment, to the downplaying of the severity of the crisis, to the naysaying of scientific and medical experts. Hundreds of thousands of deaths and millions of sick people can be directly laid on the head of the Denier In Chief.

This is truly Trump's Pandemic."
2021-03-11 16:16:38,"What a difference a year makes. I experienced the pandemic both in Seattle, where I had lived for 22 years,  and in South Carolina, where I moved this year to take care of my Mom.   Last spring there was so much arrogance in the places the virus had not yet hit, so much derision of places like New York and Seattle. Now S. Carolina has some of the worst numbers, due to terrible leadership and stubborn refusal to follow public health recommendations.  No place was perfect and we've all suffered, but there will be much to learn. Kudos Seattlelites."
2021-03-11 16:05:10,"I am glad we saved lives.  Unfortunately we missed opportunities in Seattle to prevent future losses and impacts to mental health.  Some of Seattle’s and Washington State’s missteps will contribute to inequity for years if not decades to come.

I’m proud of our city.   However we must address the areas that are hurting with intelligence, problem solving and speed.

Despite claiming that shutting down schools saved lives, kids were crammed into noisy community centers and day cares with unequipped, non protected staff trying to help teach them.  

Special Ed and vulnerable kids remain home trying to learn remotely.

Teachers were not considered “essential” so they weren’t vaccinated, and are not able to return to school.   We need focused teacher vaccination efforts to get them back.

Some single parents did not receive their unemployment checks for months.  

Working parents are no longer given the grace they received in the early days.  More of them will lose their jobs.   Paid COVID leave has run out.

It’s time to take these issues seriously in Seattle.  I recommend starting with the kids that are hurting the most."
2021-03-11 16:11:00,"In the “cons” column of this exercise: my middle schoolers have been remote schooling for an entire year now. Academic losses are one impact, but more importantly they are depressed and disengaging from school. The teachers union has seized upon safety as a reason to stay remote indefinitely  in spite of access to vaccines now - it seems the goalposts keep moving. There is no end in sight."
2021-03-11 15:45:23,"Schools have been closed to in person attendance for a year, as has been the case in much of Oregon. So yes these areas have done well in terms of COVID, but tell that to the kids who have born the brunt of this epidemic. Time will tell if it was worth it in terms of impact on lives of children."
2021-03-11 16:02:29,"As a Seattle resident, his story would have been more believable if it matched the state of Washington's ethnic demographics with that of New York's. It was glossed over and should have been explored. Some groups of people were more susceptible to the disease than others."
2021-03-11 16:22:40,"Besides having a low Covid19 score, Seattle scores high in politeness.  Does the politeness factor make a difference?  I think it does.  We are a citizenry of polite people who stop for pedestrians crossing the street, we donate generously to our local food banks, we say please and thank you a lot and we all wear masks in public.  Yes, we are known for street protests and occasionally our downtown area gets smashed up but those events are driven by the very small percentage of individuals who are extremely impolite no matter what the issue is.  Other than the protestors, the rest of us are polite, mask wearing rule followers."
2021-03-11 14:32:39,"There are so many factors, and we have no right to be smug. On balance our population is highly educated and can afford to live in low density housing so I'd guess we had minimal household transmission compared to NYC or LA. But it's also absolutely true that our public health messaging has been clear, consistent, and guided by science; and that the population has been highly compliant with the guidelines. Amazingly enough: it has worked.

Family from Texas came to visit in January (they had already had covid and I'm vaccinated). They were absolutely shocked by the near 100% mask compliance. It made them want to move here;  it made them feel safe."
2021-03-11 14:39:02,"Speaking from experience having lived in Seattle for 17 years, I am sure a higher level of income and access to a car instead of having to use public transportation to get to and from work also played a part as well having a less dense population as compared to NYC played a part in the success."
2021-03-11 16:14:11,"I'm confused why there's no mention of number of cases. Isn't that the true measure of the efficacy of lockdown measures? That would control more for the ""younger, thinner, healthier population"" factor. I'm very happy our deaths are so low but think this article is making too large of a leap in implying causality."
2021-03-11 14:56:12,"Seattle has a few demographic attributes that may explain this outcome:
1.) Seattle is very highly educated, with over 60% of the population having a bachelor's degree; they are more likely to have jobs that allow for social distancing.
2.) Seattle has a median age that is three years younger than the US average.
3.) Seattle has a lower than average proportion of historically marginalized groups which have been disproportionately impacted from Covid-19. Less than 20% of Seattle's population is Black or Hispanic. 
In comparison, about 50% of NYC's population is Black or Hispanic. The mortality risk from Coivd-19 is approximately twice as high for Black and Hispanic people, so demographics likely explain some of the differences in mortality between metro regions."
2021-03-11 16:19:43,"Since the pandemic started, Portland, OR has had the lowest Covid counts for a major metro area!  Seattle and Portland are similar to one another in population size.  Oregon as a state, as well, has had the lowest counts amongst other states.  This is something that we should be commended for as a city. It’s frustrating that newsfeeds never mention our city amongst other major US cities, unless it’s to negatively depict us as rioting anarchists. My elderly father even comments that the weather reporter always skips over Portland (the entire state of Oregon) when mentioning the forecast. I am giving Portland, OR a much needed applause and positive “shout-out” for doing a wonderful job keeping Covid numbers down during this past year!"
2021-03-11 16:25:03,"I'm so proud of my fellow Seattleites. I was watching the sun set over the Olympics last night in a popular city park, and - even though we were all outside and our COVID infection rates are low - 99% of people (young, old, all ethnicities) in the park were wearing masks. Not only is this a sign that we still respect medical science, it shows that we respect and care for each other. We're now a year in to our lock down, many of us are getting vaccinated and we're about to open a massive vaccination site at Lumen Field, we're clearly still working hard at keeping our neighbors healthy and alive. 

It is absolutely heartbreaking to think about the 300,000+ people that would still be alive if others had learned from our First In experience, and so tragic that all the COVID long-termers will have to deal with the repercussions of poor leadership for an unknown period of time. All the disruptions to families, all the loss, all the remote goodbyes, all the grief that could have been avoided if Truth was respected. And in the bigger picture, if humans had respected nature and not caused this pandemic to begin with.

I hope we never make that same mistake again."
2021-03-11 15:32:19,"I’m a Seattleite and I’ve largely supported these measures, but there have been perfectly absurd policies at work here too. In Summer 2020, the parking lots at local parks were literally blocked by the police and people were discouraged from congregating there. This only pushed cars into nearby neighborhoods and disadvantaged those with disabilities. At the same time, the city deployed minders to the parks to remind people not to stand or sit too close to each other. Indeed, there are still play structures closed in some locations, like Seattle Center. 

During the exact same period, the city literally ceded blocks of Capitol Hill to protestors for weeks on end. No enforcement of public health measure there. It was easier to park next to the CHOP and sit within six feet of friends in Cal Anderson than it was to do the same thing at Volunteer Park just a few blocks away.

Let’s be clear: our community did the right thing, but our leaders were not crystal clear in their messaging. Denying people access to outdoor recreation while enabling others to take over public space for political purposes was a glaring mistake and very frustrating experience for many."
2021-03-11 15:40:36,"San Francisco has about the same, in the 60s per 100,000. What was San Francisco's path? What did they do similarly and differently? Do they represent two different successful options? Or variations of the same?"
2021-03-11 15:36:37,"And we’re not done yet.... Seattleites are also reportedly showing less vaccine hesitancy than other areas and what is planned to become the highest capacity civilian run mass vaccination site (when supplies are fully available and can keep up with demand) will opening this weekend. The goal is to reach 20,000 vaccinations/day at that single site."
2021-03-11 15:38:00,"And yet...our Seattle kids are not even close to being back in school buildings. I’d write more about this travesty, but gotta go convince my kid to log onto yet another meeting."
2021-03-11 14:29:45,"I've lived in NY, NJ, PA, OH and now WA in my adult life and I am very happy we were in WA during this pandemic. I know Jay Inslee didn't make a splash during the presidential election, but the calm, measured decisions he made here I wish he could have made for the rest of the country. Businesses are opening now in part because I haven't seen a single person fighting the mask mandate since it began and people to do so. Thank you, WA!"
2021-03-11 16:36:52,"I do have to agree - the big glaring flaw here is that children in Seattle have not been returned to schools (which we know can be done safely) and there is no plans to do so.

Unlike our county public Heath officer says, I think keeping kids out of school for a year to plus isn’t something that can be mitigated."
2021-03-11 16:37:02,"I’m glad to hear that the Seattle area has performed well.  Most people walking in the park are wearing masks.  Runners who aren’t wearing masks will often turn and run the other way rather than run by someone.  This didn’t happen immediately at the beginning of the pandemic, but conscientiousness did happen pretty early into the pandemic."
2021-03-11 16:40:17,"I lived in Seattle for 13 years. During that time I saw many new people come  to work in tech, and many long-time residents fade away. Ballard used to be full of little old Norwegian ladies, now it's full of $800,000 condos and hip bars. Formerly low-income neighborhoods all around the city were quickly gentrified. 

What I'm getting at is, Seattle's low virus death rate may be at least partly due to demographics. The city has a small footprint - just 730,000 residents. Many of the most vulnerable to covid -  older, lower-income, or minority residents were priced out into the suburbs in recent years."
2021-03-11 16:38:57,"What’s missing from this article? Anything about Washington’s slow and inequitable vaccine rollout. We’ve done well in many areas, some due to chance and some due to planning, but we’re lagging at vaccines and have huge racial disparities in whose been vaccinated so far."
2021-03-11 16:33:21,"Proud to be a Seattle today. It has been a long struggle, but we collectively did the right thing."
2021-03-11 16:38:01,"300,000 dead would be alive today in the US, if the rest of the country had reacted like Seattle, with resolve as if human lives matter. 

Metropolitan places around the world did a lot worse than the entire country. So it is a real anomaly to have Seattle with such great success saving lives when the rest of the US had turned into COVID-19 killing fields by the misguided belief, human life loss is acceptable to benefit the economy. What a trumpian folly in his desperate attempt to win a second term. 

Greece like Seattle reacted with huge speed and prevented COVID-19 deaths by shutting down and enforcing mask mandate with a $175 fine, more than speeding because COVID-19 is more lethal than speeding. When summer came and the cat was left out of the bag with tourists and lax behavior the mask fine was doubled to $350 and second wave was brought under control. 

Coincidentally today Greece with exactly at 64 per 100,000 COVID-19 deaths, also proved that 300,000 Americans did not need to die (will anyone go to jail for homicidal negligence?). By the way the early success in Greece during  the spring time was so dramatic that schools had opened in May, before the summer second wave hit. 

Thoughtful and responsible response  to the pandemic even with some mistakes, not only saved lives but caused less damage to the economy."
2021-03-11 16:31:20,"That's because here in Seattle, we take science seriously, listen to experts, and care about our neighbors. 

I live in Lake Forest Park, a suburb of roughly 14,000 people just north of Seattle, and so far we've had a TOTAL of 17 hospitalizations and 4 deaths since the pandemic began."
2021-03-11 15:56:22,"These numbers are backed up by world numbers showing that we could have easily cut the death count in half.

These deaths are at the feet of right wing propagandists, the republican politicians and those who supported them.

Did republicans actively pursue this path to cause death in democrat communities?  Seems likely so go get them investigative reporters."
2021-03-11 15:42:18,"When corporations and plutocrats call the shots, it's all about the bottom line.  They really don't care who dies; it's the profits that count."
2021-03-11 16:31:22,"We ALL wear masks, to not wear one is to commit a social sin. Even the homeless wear masks here."
2021-03-11 14:49:39,The state has relatively one of the lowest death rates and yet right wingers still complain about Inslee and the restrictions. We're dealing with a pandemic. It's not all Inslee's fault.
2021-03-11 15:08:46,"It’s really pretty simple. I live in Oregon where mask use is widespread. South Dakota has even less population density, but no mask mandate. South Dakota has a death rate four times greater than Oregon. I’m sure all those extra dead people and their families sure are happy that the communist yoke of a mask mandates didn’t reach their state.  It’s really sad that those who claim the “freedom” mantle most don’t understand that with freedom comes responsibility."
2021-03-11 16:29:55,"Remember this is the same city that conservative local outlets like KOMO news and Sinclair - and even the Seattle Times like to portray as completely mismanaged. Locally we are bombarded with messages about how the city has become like Mogadishu, businesses gone forever, crime rampant, Antifa protesters on every corner stealing our rights and leftist voters getting everyone to vote by Mail. What is the world coming too? 

It’s not perfect but it better living somewhere leaders prioritize profits for the wealthy over the lives of its citizens. 

Thanks Mayor Durkan, King County Executive Dow Constantine, Governor Inslee and my community"
2021-03-11 16:23:10,"My family moved to Seattle from various locations in the Midwest over the last decade. I suspect this move saved our lives. None of us have contracted COVID. All of us have taken extreme precautions for the last year.

There is a culture here of respecting science and caring for others.  

There are outliers of course. I ended a friendship with someone who saw the holiday pandemic peak as the ideal time to plan multiple plane trips to San Francisco to race cars.  His “joy” from racing cars in California over Christmas (3rd trip in 30 days) was more important than obeying public health orders re: non-essential travel.

Hard times reveal who we are. Outliers aside, I’m damn proud to call Seattle home."
2021-03-11 16:10:15,Not bad for an anarchist city!

2021-03-11 15:05:34,"Seattleites wear masks, and they wear them properly."
2021-03-11 16:46:21,"According to the data table, San Francisco where I live has done approximately as well.  I'd say that in both cases, this, ""... may have benefited from its demographics: a healthy population living in small households and a lot of workers able to do their jobs from home."" has played a larger role than any particular virtue.

I'd rather not use this type of perspective to further divide us against each other and stigmatize those who had not the good fortune to host Microsoft or Salesforce."
2021-03-11 16:30:21,"Signs of intelligence in the USA.

A rare and breathtaking sight.

C'mon, America....lift your heads up, mask up and save lives."
2021-03-11 14:37:30,"I’m so proud of the City of my heart.  For all it’s reputation as a crunchy granola nirvana, Seattle works.  Why ???  Very few Republicans, people actually care about the welfare of others. 
  It’s that simple."
2021-03-11 14:45:54,"We followed Seattle and San Francisco's example over in the Portland area.  And our numbers and Portland's numbers a super low.  The bad numbers that is.

The worst counties in Oregon now by the numbers are Coos and Douglas who are somewhat belligerent to our Governor.  She is an evil communist in many of their minds.  They are low population counties now paying the price.

I've traveled to both Portland and Seattle during the pandemic and they are very similar in public participation of precautions still and although it is striking and eerie it is also peaceful and one feel safe that, let's say,  getting a hamburger at Dick's Drive-In on Capitol Hill in Seattle isn't going to be an end of life decision.

Texas, be careful.  You can't bring Aunt Esther and your already ailing Uncle Joe back if you make the wrong choice.  You don't want to look at their picture you have of them on the wall wondering if you brought the thing that killed them into their life."
2021-03-11 14:47:40,"Thanks, also, to having a governor who followed the advice of scientists, instead of listening to inept and corrupt politicians."
2021-03-11 15:48:19,Good luck finding a vaccine if you live outside of Seattle. Vaccines are just now beginning to trickle in to the north end of the state forcing the elderly here to drive to Seattle.
2021-03-11 15:12:07,19 nursing home deaths is not a “rampage”. Tens of thousands of children and adolescents who still  lack access to in-person education is a “rampage”.
2021-03-11 16:38:19,"I think a lot of our success comes from the simple fact that most people here didn't get suckered into the ridiculous notion that wearing a mask is somehow an assault on personal freedom (""First they make you wear a mask, and next thing you know they are coming for your guns!"").  It feels good to be surrounded by rational and smart people who simply want to do the right thing."
2021-03-11 16:10:22,"""In part, public health experts said, Seattle may have benefited from its demographics: a healthy population...""

and there it is - America refuses to talk about it's obesity problem and how it is a main factor in Covid related deaths because, well I can't continue, the Twitter Mob is already getting outraged...."
2021-03-11 16:05:06,"This is a sad commentary on the depths to which the Republican-Fidesz Party has fallen.  Not only are they an authoritarian supporting party with no morals, the immoral minority, they have become a party that cares nothing about killing their own citizens.

Their negligence and backward, self-serving, profit oriented thinking is directly responsible for these excess 300,000 deaths in the US.

The entire US public MUST be made aware of this piece while at the same time contrasting their tax cuts for the rich to President Biden's legislation that targets the average and below average Americans.

See you in 2022."
2021-03-11 16:46:08,"Seattle has nothing to be proud of. America has nothing to be proud of. The myopic view of life in which nothing exists outside of the country and no comparison can be made except for other states is pathetic and deadly. Hong Kong, with its population of 7.5 million people and a population density that is incomparable to anything in the US, has 203 deaths. That should be the standard! Taiwan and Korea should be the standard! The USA has absolutely FAILED in covid, and even with the worst death on the planet, Americans cannot accept reality. It reminds me of studies showing that American students had terrible scholastic outcomes but were also the most confident. Ignorance is deadly. I wish America would learn from its failures, but it seems that’s not possible."
2021-03-11 15:24:31,"Nice to hear about our success. I have to say I’m ready for this to be over. I have 3 kids doing online learning at home. Libraries, community centers and swimming pools have been closed all year. No one in my family or extended family has been ill. I’m a physician and very few of my patients were ill. Sometimes it seems like all our measures are too much given how little illness we had in this community. It’s nice to know it was worth it"
2021-03-11 16:49:22,"Donald Trump received about 20% of the popular vote in King County (the Seattle metropolitan area). That pretty much tells you all you need to know.

And by the way, we have universal vote by mail — a system set up and managed by our Republican Secretary of State, who is overwhelmingly popular on both sides of the aisle. King County has 1.4 million registered voters; 1.2 million ballots were counted in November 2020.

This is how grownups do things."
2021-03-11 16:50:40,"I applaud the wisdom and COURAGE that the leaders of Washington State displayed, and I believe that folks in that State owe their lives to their leaders.  I live in Phoenix, AZ where (except for a few mayors like our Phoenix Mayor, Kate Gallego) our leaders are spineless Trump followers and our dismal COVID statistics should haunt them for the rest of their lives."
2021-03-11 16:48:46,"It comes as no surprise to me that the mayor, gov, and both senators are democrats.

The contrast to Texas is all the more appalling knowing the solution to our health care, energy and voting problems are easily solved by ridding the state of republicans."
2021-03-11 16:47:41,"The flip side of our coronavirus victory is the impact on downtown Seattle. Major pre-pandemic homelessness issues hurt retail. Then BLM damage boarded up more stores. Then travel restrictions hit the convention business and Alaska cruise tourism. Then a majority of downtown's 500,000 workers learned they could skip the commute and work from home.

We're building a huge light rail system to the heart of nowhere. Downtown Seattle is a ghost town that's never going to come back without some radical changes.

Our covid response showed our city's dedication to larger causes. Rebuilding and reimagining downtown is our next challenge."
2021-03-11 16:49:16,"I felt taken care of during this pandemic by Inslee and his team. But when I go into Seattle to do business with other galleries I am shocked and depressed by the hoards of impoverished and mentally ill living in their doorways and filling the sidewalks with their make shift shelters. The galleries are still selling individual art work in the tens of thousands as this cast off population increases outside their doors. It seems to grow exponentially as the prices go up. Could there be a correlation?
I would like my state and local government take just as good care of these folks as they did of me or we are all failing."
2021-03-11 16:52:54,"As a Seattle resident, I commend my community for taking the pandemic seriously and doing a great job masking up and staying socially distant (for the most part).  It's been a long, hard road but we have collectively saved lives!  We've watched in horror as other parts of the country have pushed back on mask wearing and lock downs, only to experience higher death rates.  Our sense of freedom comes with responsibility to our neighbors; we are free not to get sick or to impose the illness on others.  Take that as a blueprint, America."
2021-03-11 16:55:58,"One thing not mentioned in this story that we've noticed on our occasional pandemic trips to social-distance visit with a family member who lives in Seattle: nearly everyone wears a mask there, even when walking around outside. It still seems strange, even after all of this time, but it also gives me a warm and fuzzy feeling. The people of Seattle really seem to care about their fellow citizens."
2021-03-11 16:57:46,"I've been visiting in Seattle for the last 4 months, from London. I have been astonished, and grateful, at the 100% mask and distancing compliance. Not at all so in the UK. Seattle's success is due in no small part to its people."
2021-03-11 16:58:18,"Kudos to Kitsap County too. The information and government responsiveness have been excellent. However, mask wearing is not as prevalent as it is in Seattle. Not sure why, but demographics, education and political affiliation probably help define those who do not comply."
2021-03-11 16:58:21,"This hit me in the gut hard: ""If the rest of the United States had kept pace with Seattle, the nation could have avoided more than 300,000 coronavirus deaths.""

Here in Seattle we took things very seriously quickly. I believe Governor Inslee called up the area's biggest companies' CEOs and asked them to send all employees to work from home (Microsoft, Starbucks, Amazon, etc.). That made a huge impact quickly, and as the article mentioned, many of these positions/roles were able to do that. 

Most Seattleites went out of their way to put the health of their neighbors and community first. Maybe it's not necessary, but it's comforting when you see your neighbor cross the street to give you space. It's a little nod that they care for you and you care for them. You never knew who you may be putting at risk: a neighbor battling cancer, a grocer who lives with an elderly family member, etc. 

Thankful to my fellow Seattleites and our leaders as we have avoided what could have been even worse. But I'm still grieving for all of those in Seattle, and beyond, who have lost treasured loved ones. What a magnitude of tragedy we could have worked together to lessen."
2021-03-11 17:02:14,"Thank you for highlighting success in a region of the country that often goes unnoticed. The great PNW is doing well in a number of areas, it’s handling of the pandemic just one. Yes, it’s been difficult. Many have lost their businesses, jobs, their families have been torn apart, and there have been deaths. But it wasn’t nearly as bad as it could have been without the sensible leadership we have here in Washington State and the generally sensible populace. For those who complain about the restrictions and mock mask wearing, is it possible that they wish the outcome had been worse, so their complaints wouldn’t be justified? In the beginning, we didn’t know what we were dealing with. We know more now, what works, what doesn’t. Some restrictions have saved lives; some weren’t so necessary, others were. We’ll be better prepared for the next pandemic, and I suspect the PNW will do well again."
2021-03-11 17:05:00,"Don't underestimate the fact that a city that includes so many tech companies whose employees can work remotely is much more able to resist calls to ""open up""."
2021-03-11 17:09:04,"I feel so fortunate to live in Seattle.  Leadership informed by science has been proactive.  Our numbers are also low because the overwhelming majority of our citizens do wear masks, social distance, stay home.

I would haved liked to see one more paragraph about how our city, county, and state have found ways to lessen the economic pain experienced by renters, restaurants, the unemployed.  I love to live where, to a large extent, we value and take care of each other."
2021-03-11 15:05:06,meanwhile in ny we had a governor who underreported nursing home deaths and a mayor who told us go eat in chinatown and to take the next subway car if it was too crowded.. and let's not forget the looting of nyc during the blm protests.. the city will return but the road back will be long hard one
2021-03-11 16:59:11,"The culture of socialized medicine is embedded in Seattle with Group Health Cooperative (now Kaiser Permente). Group Health was the largest insurer in the region for decades. This member (patient) driven health delivery system did something little else in our society does- it treats everyone equally. Everyone is cared for the same. It is palpable when you go in for services. 

When the pandemic hit, we had the security in our own health care environment to lead us. After  my highly organized, no wait vaccine, each of us met briefly with a staff member who reviewed our chart. She reminded my of my upcoming test and asked if I had any problems that needed attention.  So obvious, so smart....That 15 minute “wait” saved more lives."
2021-03-11 16:54:16,"'If the rest of the United States had kept pace with Seattle, the nation could have avoided more than 300,000 coronavirus deaths.'

Contrast Seattle's approach with the constant denial of the pandemic by former president Trump. 

Fortunately, Maryland acknowledged the pandemic last March, and the county executive recommended sensible actions: wearing home-made face masks, avoiding gatherings, washing hands and not touching one's face. 

Unfortunately, Maryland is now relaxing the guidance. So, for example, there can now be indoor dining in busy restaurants. To me, it makes no sense to ""open up"" everything [except, apparently, libraries], when there is still a  high risk of transmission AND a shortage of vaccines. 

Guess Governor Hogan is a Republican after all."
2021-03-11 17:01:41,Props to Jay Inslee are in order.  He has led by example through this whole period.
2021-03-11 17:07:24,"A testament to what can be done when people care for their fellow citizens and their community. Believing in science and medical experts over ignorant ideologies about taking away our freedom. Goes to show that freedom is participating and caring for the health and well being of our community, not just yourself."
2021-03-11 16:56:12,"Despite the negative mention of San Francisco’s mayor (whose decision to attend a party countered everything she preached), it was interesting to note that San Francisco has the 2nd lowest deaths, at 67 per 100,000 (vs. Seattle’s 64).  I suspect it relates to some similarities— a significant population able to work from home, higher compliance with mask orders, longer local shutdowns..."
2021-03-11 17:05:43,"We owe a large debt of gratitude to all the employers who were not required to pay their employees, while most businesses were shut down, but did so anyways. I cannot imagine the added weight of unemployment on top of the immense stress of quarantine. Sadly, this was the fate of a lot of Seattle residents, and others throughout the country, who are barely holding on. We cannot forget that many have fallen into financial hardship and we need a plan as aggressive as the COVID plan to rescue them as well."
2021-03-11 17:07:23,"And finally, over the past week, Gov. Inslee has joined Oregon Gov. Kate Brown and put teachers next in line to be vaccinated. 

Many, if not most, schools are considering blended re-opening in mid April. 

For students, parents and teachers this provides a vast (if complicated) relief."
2021-03-11 16:59:38,"I wonder, does Seattle's climate have something to do with their lower rates?  We know coronavirus is less transmissible in high humidity. 
I've heard they have that for prolonged spells in Seattle."
2021-03-11 17:13:03,"Clearly Seattle did what it needed to in order to grapple with the pandemic.  But the economic cost is massive - no getting around that.  Seattle's economy has fared slightly better than states that don't have its massive advantage of a work-from-home-capable tech industry base.  

Which means that if you adjusted the figures as if Seattle had the same mix of industries as your average American city...it would be absolutely devastated economically.   The price would have been worth it, probably, but there is no free lunch here."
2021-03-11 17:17:23,"I was new to Seattle when the pandemic got rolling a year ago. Seattle's numbers have been great, but the restrictions here have been heavy-handed and unnecessarily damaging.

- Seattle Public Schools has been online only for 99% of its students. There is STILL no plan to bring regular K-12 students back in person. Not hybrid, not part time, nothing.
- Seattle libraries are still closed. A fraction of them have part-time curbside book pickup. That's all.
- Seattle closed parking at its biggest parks in March, and only reopened it in OCTOBER. It had been clear for months that COVID spread is minimal outdoors with distancing.

Meanwhile, restaurants have been open (reduced capacity, sometimes outdoor only). Stores have been open. Gyms have been open. The message is clear: if it's a public service, if it's supported by taxpayers, and if it benefits kids... it's off limits. Still."
2021-03-11 17:19:01,"While it is true that Seattle has relatively high humidity during the winter months, in summer there is very little rain, and the humidity is usually a lot lower than in many East Coast cities. So I don’t think that Seattle’s lower incidence of COVID-19 is related to  high humidity."
2021-03-11 17:19:30,"There is a big difference between Seattle and other parts of Washington state. As soon as you head over the mountains to the east side of the state you see many people without masks and this has been a condition for the past year. In Spokane, a city on east side of the state, mask wearing is often shunned and the local government has not helped. Sadly, it once again seems the Democrat side of the state-  Seattle-wears masks while the Republican side does not. Spokane cannot claim the good results stated in this article."
2021-03-11 17:21:45,"As a young nurse I told myself once my kids grow up, I will work as a traveling nurse and one of the first places I wanted to go to was Seattle. Its general population is known for being able to perform CPR in much bigger numbers than any other community so I hoped to see more people having chance of surviving out-of-hospital cardiac arrest there. It turns out they are smart at many other things, like following science, and wearing mask not just for their own benefit but also for the benefit of dear neighbor. They well deserve to be recognized."
2021-03-11 17:25:56,"I am not surprised by this at all.  I have watched Seattle for years.  And if there were ever another state I would want to move to it would be Washington.   Seattle is a city which combines intelligence, responsibility and accountability, as well as diversity and environmental consciousness.  A mighty fine university, UW, is there, too.  So with the extra ingredient and a shout out to Governor Inslee, this is a recipe for success."
2021-03-11 17:30:09,"I do have to say as a long time resident that Seattle and outlying areas have done a fine job. But not all is rosy. 
Many of friends businesses will shudder this year- even with the federal money- because ecommerce is now the standard way to buy things. 
When you drive thru the capital hill and ballard and fremont neighborhoods, many buildings are tagged because the businesses are gone."
2021-03-11 17:33:45,"Seattle is also an area that is heavily steeped in the sciences.  We are all one or two degrees of separation from a doctor, computer scientist, engineer, etc.  The scientific method is engrained into our culture, thus the mandates given that are clearly science driven are easily accepted - even if we are acutely aware of their very difficult impact.  In the end, we see this situation as one where we are going to prioritize saving lives, and optimistic that all of us will economically recover, and if not, will are confident we will get the hand we need from our neighbors and local government - because Seattleites are strong, determined, empathetic people."
2021-03-11 17:25:58,"The most interesting part of this whole article is the divergence between the LA and San Francisco death rates. Same state, and more or less same progressive leadership. SF much more densely populated than LA... but SF had the second lowest death rate, and LA had one of the highest. 

Why?"
2021-03-11 17:27:30,"Very frustrating to see all the comments trying to snatch defeat from the jaws of victory i.e. people doing the right thing.

When people do the right thing good things happen.

That's the story."
2021-03-11 17:00:38,"San Francisco has by far the lowest covid death rate of any major city, significantly lower than Seattle’s. This despite the fact that it is the second most densely populated city in the United States and suffered exposure to the brutal California variant that rampaged through L.A.. This article is discussing metropolitan area, which is less meaningful given that every county establishes restrictions independently.￼"
2021-03-11 17:30:30,"On this side of the mountains, we haven't had that level of success. In fact, the death rate charts in our state look exactly like the political charts.

At least I live in Spokane. I blame the virus, and the reuse of PPE, for the death of my father, who died of pneumococcal pnemonia from drug resistant bacteria in a hospital in Richland, WA.

The success of Seattle, and the failure of the eastern half of the state, should teach us something. It won't."
2021-03-11 17:15:34,"Seattle focused on people, on relationships.
Instead so many other places focused on money. People were supposed to be most worried about the economy, which can never be good if people are sick.
If everyone had focused on what is more important (people), more lives would have been saved and the virus wouldn’t have gotten so out of control. 
Imagine if all those people yelling about  “freedom” (selfishness), had instead masked up and stayed home; we might have been well on our way back to normal (whatever that is)."
2021-03-11 17:20:57,"I see almost everyone posting in the NY Times Picks section is from Seattle, and while I agree that they have done a great job, you seem to be misinformed about California. For starters there are two California's iand n a way and they could not be more different. Here in Northern California versus the southern part of the state, we have also taken measures to control the pandemic seriously led by doctors at UCSF, Stanford and UC Davis. Additionally we listened to scientists at UC Berkeley and their school of public health. Most have followed that guidance.

Yes the mayor of SF and the Governor ignored their own advice but please look at the numbers for the Bay Area of 67 deaths per 100,000 versus Seattle's 64 and it is almost a rounding error, plus our interior counties like Sacramento also have similar numbers far better than Washington's. 

So I too wish the country had followed scientific and public health advice as both areas did, but it is better to think of the Yankees and the Red Sox versus the Yankees and the Mets in terms of SoCal and NorCal, as we call them."
2021-03-11 17:12:30,"“If the rest of the United States had kept pace with Seattle, the nation could have avoided more than 300,000 coronavirus deaths.”    

While maskwearing and early sheltering in place mandates and compliance would undoubtedly have been useful across the country and saved lives, the title and tone of this article is “If only everywhere else had followed Seattle’s example, these lives would have been saved.”  However, this conclusion does not fully account for the varying contexts in which the virus took hold such as NYC.

Unfortunately, a population of 4 million as compared with 20 million in NYC is comparing apples to oranges.  While Washington state has done a good job, this does not logically imply that NYC has not.  With 20 million people, you will have far more diversity in mask compliance (i.e. fewer people wearing masks due to politics, lack of knowledge, poverty, mental illness, cultural and religious practices and beliefs etc.).  Population density in housing and public spaces plays a greater part in virus exposure than the article recognizes. And shutting down a school system with 1.1 million students has a far greater social, economic and safety impact than school systems with a small fraction of that size (such as Seattle) resulting in a longer decision-making process.  And there are numerous other differences that contributed to the impact of Covid on NYC.  Let’s be fair...."
2021-03-11 17:31:29,"The lesson is not how Seattle crushed the virus. It's how the Feds and the CDC crushed Seattle's excellent response to the first identified Covid 19 case in the US.  

Frontline's ""Tale of Two Washington"" documents how Washington state and the Seattle area did just about everything right. Seattle's public health officials, as well as Trump administration people had attended an international conference on pandemic responses just prior to the eruption of this novel coronavirus. When the first Covid 19 case arrived at their door, ""We were waiting for him."" was a comment from the Seattle medical team. Suspecting Covid 19, CDC granted the request for a PCR test; it was positive. But the CDC Covid 19 test was found to be inaccurate and so there could be no monitoring of the spread of this virus, which turned out to be not linear, but exponential. 

Given how well Washington state responded to that first case, it's likely they could and would have crushed the virus in Spring 2020, had the Federal government not failed them and us.

From NYT 3/10/20:
‘It’s Just Everywhere Already’: How Delays in Testing Set Back the U.S. Coronavirus Response""

BTW, let's give acknowledge SF is equivalent to Seattle in stats reported in this piece. Seattle had 64, SF had 67 Covid 19 deaths/100,000."
2021-03-11 17:25:36,"I'm grateful for the leadership shown by Jay Inslee. Most residents of Seattle trust him and voted for him. Most politicians love showing their face; he's always photographed speaking in a mask. He spoke frequently about how much he wanted to celebrate holidays with his grandchildren, but he chose not too. We felt we could sacrifice when he was doing it with us."
2021-03-11 17:27:51,"Seattle's restrictions may have had a negative impact on its economy, all to safeguard the lives that might have been lost otherwise, due to the imprudent exposure to a lethal viral pandemia. Well, the results are in: it seems as though being poor and alive beats being wealthy but dead...every time of the day!"
2021-03-11 17:09:47,"Seattle made the right decision to put public health over the economy. If only the rest of the country had done that, hundreds of thousands of lives could have been saved. You can get a lot job back, but not a lost life. I will never understand why this wasn’t important to so many people."
2021-03-11 17:21:23,"My extended family is a researcher’s prime example of why the U.S. is concluding this Pandemic a leader in COVID deaths and cases. Viewing drastic action as beneficial to the public I supported Seattle’s, King County’s and Washington State’s acts to attempt to control, and even eliminate Coronavirus in our society. Conservative members of my family saw the actions of Governor Inslee and others as intrusions on their rights of self expression and the Coronavirus as an over exaggerated disease meriting no more response than seasonal influenza.

A year later I live in a city that is realistically economically in shambles like many parts of the U.S. but, as the writer points out, has one of the lowest death rates in a nation that overall has one of the highest death rates in the world. My Conservative relatives live in Washington Counties and portions of King County that defied guidelines and that have tallied the highest case counts and death rates in Washington State.

Ideology has been exposed to be an ineffective, immoral and unethical tool to employ to respond to physical-world emergencies, and yet after a year of collecting the sobering data that condemns our nation’s Conservative response to COVID-19 the position of my relatives, and far too many Conservative leaders and their unquestioning supporters, is  to change the subject or pretend their alternative explanation of reality is the only one deserving attention."
2021-03-11 17:29:49,"Seattle native here.  Seeing comments about the demographics of the region, one wonders why the population is younger, smarter, and healthier than the national averages.   

Seattle and Washington state have a long history of progressive and collaborative public policies and a strong labor movement with a high minimum wage, paid sick leave, and paid family & medical leave. 

In the early days of the 20th century it was known as ""The People's Republic of Washington.""  Seattle had the first woman mayor of a major city in 1926.  Our first woman governor elected in 1975 was an atomic scientist.  

People here do tend to be rule-followers.  No jaywalking, no littering.  Some complain we are the worst drivers in the nation because we are exceedingly polite, don't speed, and use our signals. 

It's said that by 1910 a third of Seattle's population was Norwegian immigrants.  One wonders if the Scandinavian tendency toward social cooperation is in the city's DNA.  

Group Health started as a non-profit medical cooperative in 1945.  REI started in 1935 as a co-op for people to buy high quality outdoor equipment.  Costco. Filson.  Businesses that sell and make quality products and pay their workers. 

Washingtonians have never been as hung up on cultural wedge issues like other parts of the country-people come here to get away from all that.  We just want to grab a craft beer, go outside, have a cup of coffee, and read a book."
2021-03-11 17:14:30,"Born and educated in Michigan, now a resident of Seattle for over 10 years.  I love this city and this region - I will be here for the rest of my life."
2021-03-11 17:22:44,"I find it curious that the article praises Seattle and negatively mentions California, including San Francisco‘s mayor‘s dining faux pas. As seen on the graph, SF had the second lowest death rate of the major metropolitan areas, only three deaths per 100,000 higher than Seattle. People here have been super patient and compliant with all precautions; school openings have been difficult, but generally the Bay Area has been doing things right."
2021-03-11 17:34:57,"Special thanks to the Seattle Flu Study for finding a loophole to allow them to test people for Covid when the CDC was essentially prohibiting it. We didn't have the earliest outbreak, we just had the earliest known outbreak, but that knowledge allowed us to start locking down a good two weeks before the rest of the country. It made a big difference, not only in how many cases we started out with, but also in our level of trust in our government and medical authorities."
2021-03-11 17:38:32,"One thing I've been very thankful for and proud of in Seattle: zero culture war about mask wearing. We just do and it's no big deal. I have family in Idaho and rural Oregon, and so much energy has been wasted in those locales arguing about masks and the pandemic."
2021-03-11 17:43:33,"I'm glad to see my beloved city given credit in the national news. While the restrictions have been difficult, to say the least, and there has been plenty of argument about what the right way to manage the pandemic might be, we have listened to science and willingly made sacrifices to protect our community.

Our schools are still operating remotely, and receive criticism and grumblings as a result. While I, as a teacher and a parent, agree that in person school is better than online school, I am sure that our decision to protect our community by staying in online school until this point was wise and life-saving. It has been a year filled with sacrifices, but those sacrifices were worth it. I trust the guidelines around reopening in my state, and when my school district is able to meet those guidelines I will look forward to returning to the physical classroom, but until then, I'm going to do my best to be a great online instructor, knowing that it is a way to protect my community.

Seattle did the right thing, not the easy thing, and I'm proud of us."
2021-03-11 17:45:12,"I live in Seattle and have been heartened to be in such a caring community. Many small businesses have shuttered but others have thrived (I've spoken with a few that are doing better) because the people here are getting takeout, in part, to help businesses. There has been a large effort to help businesses, many who have transitioned to an online presence. Community service has risen with people collecting food, including converting our little libraries into food dispensaries. That is caring for your neighbors."
2021-03-11 17:45:50,"The reasons for Seattle's success may be simple. It has the best-educated population, on the basis of college graduation rates, of any major city in the country. San Francisco is not far behind. Relatively speaking, cities like New York and Los Angeles have far fewer residents with college degrees. So to a great extent, success in the pandemic comes down to individual behavior--to educated citizens who take the trouble to learn the facts and to follow the science."
2021-03-11 17:52:26,"The most obvious difference I've noticed between here and elsewhere: masks. 

Mask-wearing in public is nearly universal in Seattle. At the grocery store, I've seen someone WITHOUT a mask only a few times in the past year. I'm convinced the results are not coincidence."
2021-03-11 17:52:48,"I believe being an international city connected with Asia also helped Seattle--I know it helped me. My Chinese and South Korean coworkers were alarmed by the virus much earlier and had a clearer understanding of the dangers of the virus from talking with their friends and family back home; they told me the thought this was 'the big one' even before our city leadership did. They were the first to ask to work from home at my workplace. They were already talking about masking in January and February.  They shared with me the concept of masking to protect others, not just yourself. Messages from city leadership resonated even more when they were already messages I'd been hearing from trusted personal connections."
2021-03-11 17:55:08,"Very proud of and grateful to my home town and state’s exemplary leaders and citizen. Still concerned though, that for all the good, my 94 and 85 year old parents can’t seem to get access to vaccination ... which is the next step to effective response to the pandemic.  I hope that vaccine distribution is soon as well-managed as the rest of the situation in Washington State."
2021-03-11 18:05:00,"I live here. It feels like the bare minimum. People are still out and about, driving, going for walks, the trails in urban parks and in our state parks are packed. There's no real ""restrictions"" on people except on how you work, and the social opprobrium of being unmasked (it turns out that here, ""shame"" is still a thing, and people are unafraid to call people out if they aren't wearing a mask). 

Seattle is also the least religious city in the country, and with the highest book readership in the country. Perhaps that has something to do with our success, too.

But I was stuck abroad during the first phase of the pandemic - March through May in Portugal. Let me tell you, compared to how they were enforcing ""lockdown"" there, with their guardia out on the roads pulling people over and telling them they couldn't go anywhere, had to go home, and arresting scofflaws? - no, Seattle wasn't really doing anything. In fact, we shouldn't use the word ""lockdown"" at all. There was no lockdown in the USA. Not anywhere. The only thing we had were mask mandates and restrictions on non-essential business, but no meaningful enforcement."
2021-03-11 18:08:21,"The other aspect of this pandemic that Seattle has 'done right' is the rapid and humane response to the pandemic's effects on our considerable homeless population. Opening up COVID-19 isolation and recovery units in unused hotels and in the old nurses' home at Harborview Medical Center, easing 'street sweeps' of homeless encampments (since living rough outside is safer than living in overcrowded shelters), and early vaccination efforts. Most people here in Seattle recognized early on that homeless people are much more vulnerable to the effects of illnesses like COVID-19 and are not the 'cause' of such infectious diseases."
2021-03-11 18:12:50,"We moved from north of Seattle to Tucson in 2019. We love it here except for some of the politicians who followed Trump (Gov. Ducey) instead of public health recommendations. The only thing we’ve missed during the pandemic is the progressive, science-based decisions of Washington’s Governor Inslee and other leaders in Western Washington. The Democratic women mayors of Tucson and Phoenix took the lead in advocating mask wearing. Governor Ducey never issued a state-wide mask wearing mandate. Who you vote for does have consequences."
2021-03-11 18:13:31,"This morning it’s sunny in Seattle and this article is only increasing the positive vibes!  Last night two of my neighbors and I had a socially distanced catching up in the Lobby of our building (while masked of course!) and words of gratitude for our Gov.Jay Inslee, medical community, and vaccination rates were spoken.  Two of us are still unemployed since last March, I went back to college full-time (online), and my other neighbor waits tables for a Ballard restaurant.  

My neighbors and my building’s property management have looked out for one another during the pandemic, even stepping in when the mental health of a neighbor was concerning.  

The Orvis store has reopened below my apartment and Patagonia seems to be thriving once again across the street and two Belltown restaurants that said they were closing forever reopened last week.  

I feel hopeful witnessing signs of reopening, yet we are all cautiously optimistic while still wearing masks (yes even outside!) and adhering to the Phase 2 reopening set in in place by our Governor.

Grateful to have moved back to Seattle in 2001.  It is truly a great place to live, even during a pandemic."
2021-03-11 18:18:35,"As a parent of a University of Washington student, I want to add to this analysis that the UW residence hall students deserve considerable credit for adherence to strict practices and enduring months of isolation for the general welfare of the entire community. I’ve witnessed the consistency of mask-wearing and isolating used by these young adults. It’s been incredible to see! The greater Seattle area owes them a debt of gratitude."
2021-03-11 18:24:16,"good piece. i live out here and while it's been tough, it's been better than in most places around the country and i have been pretty pleased at how the (mostly democratic) leadership in this state and area has handled things.

2021-03-11 18:24:17,"As a lifetime Seattle area resident, I'm proud of the way this region has handled the pandemic. My mother is in a retirement home in Kirkland, just a few miles away from Life Care Center (ground zero for the first cluster of cases), which was terrifying. Yes, it's true that this area was lucky in that so many people were able to ""pivot"" (god, I'm tired of that term) to work from home, but many were not. I think it should be noted that those lucky enough to work from their home office were often in a bubble of how bad it has been for other industries. My partner's colleagues actually said, ""Well, it's not like we actually KNOW anyone who has lost their job..."" She had to point out that I did. I work in the cruise industry, lost my job in June, and it took almost 8 months to get a new position... yes, in the tech industry. Hospitality and tourism here has been as devastated, if not even more, than the struggling restaurant industry. It's heartbreaking."
2021-03-11 18:25:30,"Two political things about Washington State.  We have a law that enables the Governor to declare an emergency and then operate with extraordinary powers.  It's pretty hard to argue that this isn't an emergency or that Inslee was making arbitrary or capricious decisions, even if you disagree with his decisions.

Second, everyone can vote for anyone on the ballot in primary elections and then the top two vote getters go on to run in the general election.  This gives moderates a decent chance of winning elections in both red and blue parts of the state."
2021-03-11 18:27:50,"I'm pleased to see that San Francisco numbers are close to Seattle's in being the lowest in the nation. 

We do have similar populations. For the whole year I have seen almost everyone wearing masks and complying with restrictions. Very few in denial here about the need to protect ourselves and each other during this crisis. We have basic agreements about science and logic and that certain efforts are worth it in the long run."
2021-03-11 18:28:26,I am so grateful to Seattle for all it has done from the very beginning of the pandemic. You have been an inspiration to us in the Bay Area who have been tracking this crisis from early days. Here we have also been so fortunate in how State and local government have handled everything including the regional effort to set norms from the beginning.
2021-03-11 18:34:21,"As a Seattlite, I'm proud to read about how our city banded together, trusted the science, and achieved these results. Yet it is bittersweet, as ironically today is also the anniversary of the last time my 7yo went to school, a streak with no end in sight (unless, of course, I transfer him to private school, where many privileged kids have been safely back at school for months).

That restaurants, gyms, and more are open while students remain at home is a different sort of public policy failure. While some will say we ""can't have it both ways,"" I can't help wondering if that's true: The same science that guided our initial approach also now provides us avenues to open schools as safely as possible, yet our teachers union seems determined to ignore that science at the expense of our children."
2021-03-11 18:38:21,"I am grateful to our governor and local officials for their calm and consistent leadership that has saved so many lives. I just wish that Seattle, and the country as a whole, had done much more to mitigate the sacrifice this demanded. The public sacrifice is not the same for affluent office workers able to continue working in safety as it is for business owners forced to close with little compensation for lost income or those deemed essential and forced to work in unsafe conditions with no way to care for their families during their shifts. Seattle made a valiant effort to contain the virus, but very little was done to provide financial support to those most impacted by the containment effort. This is true around the country."
2021-03-11 17:06:45,"I lived in Seattle for 30+ years. One thing about Seattle is that it has demographics that are far different than most other major cities, in particular, Seattle is very low on the proportion of Blacks (about 7%) and very high in Asian (about 15%). It is well known that Covid has hit the Black community worse than the White community, but what is less publicized is that the Asian community has fared much better than White or Black. So, you load a city up with the ethnic groups that do the best with Covid and yes, it will look much better than other cities. The other factor is that Seattle is very blue so if the people are told to wear masks, they won't riot like they do in some other cities."
2021-03-11 18:44:49,"Eyeballing these numbers, it seems that the greatest correlators with deaths per 100k are population density and race (and by de facto, probably preexisting conditions), not political affiliation or statewide lockdown policies. Seattle is unusually white collar and cannot be effectively compared to places with higher service sector employment and/or population density without accounting for confounding variables. That's not to say they did nothing right; Minneapolis had about twice the deaths with fairly similar demographics."
2021-03-11 18:54:18,"Thanks for this interesting article. While Seattle's achievements in controlling the pandemic benefit all of us and are a good example for the rest of the country, aggregate data obscures significant variation within Seattle and King County. Many of my neighbors here in South Seattle have flaunted social distancing and face mask recommendations throughout the pandemic, and most still do  not wear facemasks. Probably as a result, my neighborhood currently has a rate of positive coronavirus tests that is 35% above the county average. It's frustrating and discouraging to see that many among us don't and never have made the effort to help curtail the pandemic. Seattle and the country could be doing so much better."
2021-03-11 17:01:30,Another one of those liberal cities in a liberal state that fails...oh wait!
2021-03-11 18:18:54,Seems like the wrong governor wrote a book about leadership in the time of COVID.

More misdirection, ""bothsiderism"", truly disappointing.

How about ""The entire Trump administration.""

Why not give credit where credit is due?"
2021-03-11 16:06:58,Yeah cause we have fewer dummies who run outside and start licking each other the moment they read encouraging headlines. Maybe it's the seasonal depression or the existing general disinclination to meet strangers. (It's that the Republicans live in Issaquah or on the other side of the mountains.)

Sensitive government also matters.

But, employees are safe, not exposed and the reality of this virus is important to respect and fear.
We have all been isolated and careful. And I appreciate a place that values our lives and safety more than  $$$$$. Life will return to normal and we must applaud those who know when to put their feet on the brakes. It saved lives."

Most of the population is concentrated in the Oslo area and southern Norway. I wish we had been able to replicate their result.

Totally different result in adjacent Sweden, which took a more lax approach: more than 12,000 deaths (pop 10M). The two economies have fared similarly with very different approaches. So this wasn’t about “the economy stupid” it was about saving lives.

Instead, what we're seeing is a national trend with some outliers, like Seattle. In some sense, politics is just icing. It doesn't matter if the Texas gov lifts mask mandates: plenty of Texans aren't going to wear masks anyway. Social distance rules don't matter in homes with 10 people. 

But there's something about scale that matters. It would be nice to understand. Does the trend hold in other big cities in other countries? Instead of climate being the ecological factor that's important, maybe it's vast networks of people. The strength of weak links."
2021-03-11 18:36:38,"Trying to identify factors that allowed Seattle to keep COVID deaths low is a guessing game. Why not compare the similarities in performance between San Francisco and Seattle, cities with near identical death rates per 100,000, to find the answers. Then the guessing can be a little bit more accurate.

2021-03-11 18:00:48,"I live in across the Sound from Seattle, and I think the most important factor in our relative success keeping the virus in check has been almost universal cooperation with masking and other mitigation measures. After the tragic outbreak at an Everett care facility in April 2020  was widely reported here, I rarely saw an unmasked person. Talk about restrictions was matter of fact: just things we had to put up with for the duration. 

Consistent and low-drama communication from Governor Inslee, King County Executive Constantine, and Mayor Durkan played a constructive role; and public health ads reinforced the messaging.  But the most important factor was, I think, community willingness to accept the fact of the crisis, and take recommended precautions. There was no place for the sad, stupid debate on whether the virus was  a hoax to take root, and not much political hay to make of that nonsense."
2021-03-11 17:33:54,"I don't know about Seattle, but the numbers for San Francisco - showing an infection rate of 67 per 100,000 for a population of 4.7 million - are definitely wrong.  According to figures posted in the NYT, that 67-per-100,000 rate is for San Francisco County, which is the city proper, with a population of under a million
To reach the 4.7 million figure, you would have to include Santa Clara, Alameda, and Contra Costa counties. (The San Francisco Bay Area is usually defined by 9 counties with a population of 7.75 million.)  While Contra Costa had a fairly low infection rate, Alameda and Santa Clara had much higher rates ... the latter driven initially by the large number of high-tech workers travelling to Asia in the early stages of the pandemic.
Incidentally, the idea advanced by some here that San Francisco is a preserve for wealthy and privileged whites is also wildly inaccurate.  In fact, over 50% of the population of the San Francisco Bay Area is Asian, Hispanic, African-American, Pacific Islander, etc."
2021-03-11 17:42:40,The number one reason Seattle had the lowest per capita rate of death:  Western Washington is a progressive area where people are willing to have concern about others and not just themselves.  People in this area are not like all those regressives who constantly worry about their freedoms being infringed.
2021-03-11 17:47:35,"One of the things that has been remarkable about the coronavirus pandemic is that it has produced a living laboratory to which we all have been given access.  We can now see with our own eyes what happens when states follow science, enforce protective rules, and its people follow those rules (Washington), versus when states ignore science, do not enforce protective rules, and its people reject any restrictions on their ""personal liberty"" (South Dakota).  We can now see what happens with mixed messaging and counterproductive messaging, versus what happens with clear messaging and messaging that follows the science.  We can now see what happens when a president shrugs his shoulders and says ""not my problem,"" versus what happens when a president shoulders responsibility and uses the full powers of his office to steer the country in the right direction.

Soon our living laboratory will now let us see what happens when Texas uniformly lifts coronavirus restrictions, versus what happens when Washington continues to follow new federal guidelines.  In approximately 2-3 weeks, we're going to see covid cases and deaths rising in Texas, and covid cases and deaths continuing to fall in Washington.

Kudos to Washington Governor Jay Inslee for having the courage to make policy decisions based on science and not caving in to selfishness and stupidity.  I hope we will be seeing and hearing more of him in the future."
2021-03-11 18:33:27,"Having a governor, county executives, and mayors that believe in science made the biggest difference. Herd masking and social distancing helped too. I'm hoping that more frequent hand washing was in there as well.

What happened in Kirkland scared people smart."
2021-03-11 17:36:25,"Unfortunately, there are many other parts of Washington State where county officials and sheriffs supported a misguided sense of freedom, people didn’t and still don’t wear masks, stormed the State capital in protest to Inslee’s public health-driven policies, criticized those who supported public health measures, even threatened public health employees (and believe trump’s big lie). These pockets of ill informed Washingtonians threaten the well-being of the rest of us - both from a health perspective as well as maintaining a democracy."
2021-03-11 17:47:16,"I work in the construction industry. I feel that Seattle and San Francisco benefited from a mild climate (as well as good public policy). 

Here in Boston, we had city and state leadership committed to a proactive approach and citizens who embraced mask wearing, social distancing, and the rest of it — yet had a relatively high death rate. 

The reason, it seems to me, is the fact that most homes and apartment buildings here are densely populated and have very old heating and cooling systems with little to no ventilation. Several people I know contracted Covid while sequestered at home. Last year we had a prolonged, cold early spring during the initial lockdown and cases surged even while we were at home. Then cases plunged to near zero as the weather warmed, and surged again as it got cooler. 

New Englanders generally don’t have central AC in their residences, especially in more modest ones. But areas of the country that do saw significant summer Covid spikes — the humid Upper Midwest and South. This happened both in places with sensible Covid restrictions and without them.

I’m hoping one of the long term lessons from Covid is that our indoor residential airscape get looked at much more closely, especially because energy efficient ventilation is so cheap to install. The next virus may also be airborne and thrive indoors."
2021-03-11 17:48:52,"It seems ridiculous to compare cities without looking at WHEN those deaths happened.   NYC's Mayor made a bad decision a year ago, before people understood much about the virus, and there was a much higher death toll in the early days when doctors did not know much.

Why did the cities who got hit hard in late summer or fall do so poorly?  Did they not care?

And we now know that some people were privileged and offered early treatment with the antibody treatments in early stages that are not widely available to the vast majority of americans who aren't privileged and who had much higher death rates.

When a reporter does a study of how many prominent Republicans and their friends got antibody treatments in the early stage of their illnesses, while others who weren't privileged did not, that will be a worthwhile article.

What percentage of privileged Republican politicians and their friends who tested positive for COVID got antibody infusions early in their diagnosis when their illnesses were mild compared to the percentage of low-income workers?  I'm guessing it was a magnitude of 1000 fold."
2021-03-11 18:14:09,It appears to me that a close reading of this article seems to indicate that lockdowns and other restrictions had little effect and that other factors were predominate.
2021-03-11 17:36:41,"I'm so proud to be a resident of Washington state and reside in the Seattle area.  The leadership, decisive action taken, a fact based response strategy, and clear communication have been the difference between 5k deaths versus 50k deaths in the state.  This is why we need to elect leaders that can accept facts and science even when they're inconvenient.  Elections matter!"
2021-03-11 17:51:31,"Horrific. Utterly horrific feeling I get when I look at that mortality table. This is by no means a boast and reflective of a comm particle ease to geographically isolate but Australia’s mortality rate per 100,000 is around 3.5 with Seattle at 64."
2021-03-11 17:44:53,"One of my friends works in the Amazon building located next to the Amazon bubble in your photo.  He said they had guests from Wuhan visiting that building for a week in January 2020...  In my downtown Seattle office, some of us were loathe to work from home although we were set up with all of the equipment to do so at the start of March.  Finally one day we noticed the only people walking around downtown were homeless people.  This was around March 22.  We finally gave in and stopped going to the office, but not before I I had Covid symptoms that very day:  dry cough, runny nose, and the feeling there was smoke in my lungs, all lasting 15 days afterward.  But the clinic wouldn't test me, saying I was low risk.  I think this partly explains the low numbers you cite, that there was a lack of testing at the beginning, but, yes, everyone around here is vigilant about masking up and maintaining social distancing, to this very day.  It's great. I admire our leaders, Gov. Inslee and Mayor Durkan; they deserve medals for how bravely they've served their citizens during the pandemic."
2021-03-11 17:36:15,"It’s so sad that people are attacking those of us who would like children, at least elementary school kids, back in schools here. You’re all okay with the private schools in Seattle being open, but it’s not ‘safe’ for kids whose families can’t afford them? I thought we believed in science here. Schools are safe. We have thousands of examples of how to do this. Our kids in Seattle know how to wear masks. We have the kind of weather that allows for open windows and outdoor activities all year long. And yet, schools are still closed with no end in sight. I’m devastated for these children and cannot believe we are one of the major cities in the country with no plan after a year! Terrible leadership."
2021-03-11 17:40:01,"I am thankful to be living in Seattle, where from the beginning, everyone I know and see on the street here has taken the virus seriously. When COVID began here in Washington and started spreading in the US, I kept updated on the numbers in Georgia, where my family lives. I have seen how leadership and peoples mentality and seriousness about the virus makes a difference. Comparing just these two states often, I saw the numbers rise quickly in Georgia. As of today Georgia has 1 million cases and 17,491  while Washington has 350,000 cases and 5,159 deaths."
2021-03-11 18:35:23,"Whole, large nations have succeeded even better than Seattle. But they didn't have the challenge of political madness the US was (is?) suffering.

Thailand, for example, has 70 million people and 85 deaths from Covid-19. Doing the arithmetic on that one tells you that Covid-19 might not have touched the US's mortality rate in a way that was even statistically noticeable.

It did, however, touch the Thai people's lives. Masks were worn. The very concept of conflict over mask-wearing was foreign to them. They helped each other.

Someone close to me was in Thailand in February 2020. On their return though Bangkok and then Seoul, everyone in the airports, including staff, wore masks. Hand sanitzer was available, gloves were worn by TSA personnel.

Back in JFK, a nightmare. No masks. No gloves. No sanitizer. Passengers required to punch in data on touchscreens. Nothing to clean hands, not even a warning to clean hands. Nothing.

This was a form of national suicide--or from the point of view of those of us who cooperated and conformed, a form of homicide. While some nations cooperated and lived, we lived in conflict and died. 

What in the world was there to fight over? Wear a mask, maybe look silly for a while, and maybe even find out later that it wasn't necessary. Or this--the tragedy that we're living through.

Can we please now care for each other? The sacrifice at this point is greater than it should have been--but it's this, or yet more needless misery and death."
2021-03-11 17:38:33,"These Seattle responses just seem like common sense to me.  I'm happy to be in the PacNW, where the public interest may still be an actual policy goal for some time to come, but trends in the rest of America (outside the scattered blue dots) make that look more & more difficult, on a broader scale, in this country.  You can hear it in the tone of voice taken by just about any Republican speaking on any news/interview program.  The idea of doing anything for the common good is completely out of the question for them."
2021-03-11 17:56:44,"Decomposing the data from these metropolitan areas by education, income levels, and race and ethnicity would be useful. In Seattle and San Francisco, you have two large urban areas with some of the highest education levels and relatively low Latino and African American populations. As a social scientist, I think once rigorously examined, we will find that demography matters more than public health policy. Getting data from places such as Austin, Texas, and Salt Lake City, Utah, would go a long way in answering this question."
2021-03-11 17:35:46,"The article confirms what’s already known. Healthier, more affluent and educated communities have survived the pandemic much better than neglected, poor, unhealthy populations who live mostly in high density neighborhoods with poor access to good health care. I live in Chicago and could use data to show that the Gold Coast or affluent white suburbs did a much better job of containing the virus, when in fact the demographics account for the death rates. There’s no Seattle magic here."
2021-03-11 17:59:00,"As a Seattle native with many family members of different political persuasions, I can say we all wore masks, limited interactions with people outside our immediate households, and did not view it as a “culture war” to follow the recommendations.   

Some distant family said, “it’s no worse than the seasonal flu,” yet they wore masks in public and did their part.  

Proud of my area for seeing beyond narrow self-interest and cultural dog whistles."
2021-03-11 18:21:42,One major mistake in the state was a deadly delay in closing access to care-homes.  When the exposure and deaths began the gov did not shut the doors entirely until the federal agency responsible for nursing homes recommended closing all access except for essential employees and service providers.  No doubt the delay caused by advisors to the gov.  ....this advice was self serving and was more concerned about families and their “so called” rights to visit relatives and not the health of workers and other patients.
2021-03-11 19:02:20,"I live north of Seattle in the Everett area, the extended Seattle Metro area, if you will.

From my perspective, the early deaths in nursing homes were positively shocking. From the time that the local health officials broke into television programming, I knew this was Serious with a capital ""S"". That public message has never changed.

Initially, traffic on I-5 was a trickle as compared to the usual quasi-parking lot. People stayed home, if they could. Mask compliance was, and remains, good. Aside from fringe protests, people accepted these basic health measures. Sure, some people grumbled, but they also complied while grumbling. 

Yes, I felt their pain, too, when our son lost his job. However, I always believed that the fastest way back to full business was to kick COVID down as much as possible and keep it down.

Seattle is blessed to have many fine health research institutions funded by Bill Gates, Paul Allen, etc. Science works everywhere when its principles are actively applied. I just don't understand how certain governors play roulette with their citizens' lives."
2021-03-11 19:05:40,"Seattle reacted very quickly to the pandemic, sending workers home a week or even two before NY, wherein politicians acted as though no confirmed cases meant no cases, period. That lapse of judgment was serious and I believe contributed to the massive spread and deaths in New York last spring. A quicker response at a crucial time meant better outcomes."
2021-03-11 19:23:25,"I would suspect our success in Seattle is also related to the quality of our healthcare. While I don't want to diminish the wonderful healthcare workers elsewhere, I do think the incredible hard work, determination, skill, and expertise of those here has made a difference. 

I also want to express my appreciation for all of those who have enabled others to safely isolate:  grocery workers, delivery drivers, restaurant staff preparing take out, utilities workers, Amazon warehouse staff, parks employees, and on and on. They are also responsible for our low numbers.

Lastly, I am so grateful to the Seattle Public Library. We are a city of readers and they have kept us safely reading at home through their wonderful digital offerings and their pick up services. 

Thank you!"
2021-03-11 18:59:07,"Commenters here have rightly pointed out that Seattle's low deaths per capita could be attributed to the city's  large  proportion high-tech workers. Tech companies offered (and were early adopters of) work-from-home policies. Other possible factors in Seattle's low COVID case count and deaths beg consideration.

1. Population density and humidity can be excluded. Houston, TX (Harris County) has suffered five times more deaths than Seattle yet is both less densely populated and more humid than Seattle (King County).

2. While a very white city, we can probably also rule out lack of racial/ethnic diversity. Seattle's 98118 zip code is one of the most diverse in the nation.

3. We cannot exclude the coordinated efforts of our state, county, and municipal governments. Communication and public messaging have been excellent. Restrictions have been difficult and sustained.

4. Education level probably should be factored in. Science is widely accepted and adhered to.

5. Political orientation is most certainly is a factor. The vast majority of the Democratic leaning population view masks—not as a threat to their personal freedom—but as a simple tool to protect themselves and their fellow human beings.

6. Habit may also have played a part. Never underestimate the power of the ""Seattle Freeze!""
 
While I commend the efforts or our elected officials and the general lack of selfishness of my fellow Seattlites, this year has been hell."

And given that we real know absolutely nothing about who is susceptible ... I  know NO ONE who has come down with more than an asymptomatic or mild case of Covid (both Texas).  The weird URIs I had following a weird ""flue"" last Feb -- who knows. 

Trying to find a social cause for everything is absurd.  Personally, I prefer indoor and outdoor less crowded restos -- and I love the outdoor dining on the streets of NYC altho last nite I opted for indoor  -- nearly as cold as outdoor- forgot my gloves.

Initially we worried about the elderly  -- I hate to inform you young uns but after about age 75 even those of us in decent health (altho prob. on meds and with repaired joints) are wll aware that we are on countdown.  And the risk of dementia  goes up and up.   Many people have the DNRs or don't treat mandates.  It's reality.   The Covid problem was that it utterly overwhelmed the medical system.  The Times does not analyze how many of the 500K  deaths  would prob. have occurred in any case. (And yeah the counting was weird and there may have been undercounting.)

The article treats the two events as unrelated.  

This is questionable.   There is much we do not yet know.

But we do know that the reported case are only the tip
of the iceberg.  A study in Nature shows that in Orange County "" SARS-CoV-2 point seroprevalence among adults for July to August 2020 is seven-fold greater than the cumulative incidence of diagnosed cases""

That is seven times higher than the reported cases. 

We also know that the Northwest had silent Covid infection propagation for 3 months  before the first official case .   Earlier than any other US region

That is ,  there is still great uncertainty on what role unreported cases play in the propagation of Covid.

Yet our King County has the second lowest COVID levels of any county in the US. Bars, restaurants have all been open in some capacity! High spread environments open, yet kids not in school. No plan either for Fall in place that will be flexible and timely to meet CDC evolving guidelines. Although hundreds of Seattle's physicians's signed letters advocating for a return since last Fall. The city has been unable to return following Biden CDC reopening guidelines. No planning for majority of 52,000 students to come back at all, not even hybrid (part-time) and spaced in the near future. A huge great mess happening here. Social media bubbles are giving extreme voices platforms, despite the evidence of science it is safe to return students following CDC guidelines. They don't trust CDC school reopening guidelines. The district does not plan. Unable to bring back even some special ed students, and Pre-K. No reason for Seattle to be so far behind all their neighboring districts, and entire country, including larger more diverse districts like NYC 1.1 million students , Chicago and even LA. Our children are suffering and the school district turns a deaf ear to the majority of the 52,000 students. This is not safer. This is not following science and data. This is a mess."

How many massive, crowded, deteriorating housing projects are in Seattle? How many poorly funded and understaffed public hospitals? How many housed residents of Seattle live below the poverty line? Are uninsured? Are not legal citizens? There is absolutely no comparison except that both are cities that faced the pandemic early on, with no time to prepare."

Seattle Public Schools is under a federal investigation by the US Dept. of Education for the way it’s handled Special Education during the pandemic. This district is only providing in-person services for roughly 200 students. After two months of bargaining, a 3/29 agreement has been made to bring back the most basic of services for special education and preschool, ONLY. There IS ZERO plan, goal or date for grades K-12. WITH A $70M funding deficit and elementary enrollment plummeting, Seattle is a national embarrassment. Parents are desperate for a state intervention by Governor Inslee.

That is an area where Seattle (the teacher's union, specifically) is NOT following expert recommendations and where children and families are suffering the consequences - many of which are long term.

The CDC and other state and local authorities have assessed the risk on each side of the argument and agree schools can start to reopen now. The Seattle Education Association (teacher's union) is the stick in the mud."

People forget that that the Seattle area was poised to go full-Italy early on, but in February, when days were of the essence, our leadership approved development of our own Covid tests immediately after the CDC's proved faulty. Being the first to discovering the virus was key.

Most importantly--and quite contrary to what national media obsesses on--Seattle is largely comprised of highly educated, well informed rule followers. The city was completely blindsided by the pandemic and had every reason to fail at containment; instead, Seattleites pulled together as Trump scolded them for their ""overreaction"". Then all we could do was shake our heads as most of the country ignored Seattle's example and plunged time after time into avoidable disaster.

But boy-oh-boy was the country appalled when a gentrified, very artsy 4-block area of Seattle was briefly occupied by some idealistic scenesters."
2021-03-11 19:57:13,"Vancouver is another large city in the Pacific Northwest which has had low per capita deaths from the virus. Because both these cities have a large Asian population and orientation, and there was so much early publicity about the situation in China, people here were expecting problems and prepared early. Conversely, in NYC and other part of the northeast, they didn't expect the virus to come from Europe, which it did. Another thing is that in this rainy climate, people are used to spending a lot of time indoors (and, hey, cannabis is legal in Canada)."
2021-03-11 19:36:24,"In the Seattle environs, the only time since forever I haven't seen someone with a mask on was on our local ski hill.  And, immediately a ski instructor yelled at the person to put their mask up.  The dude said "" I don't need a lecture"", which got the response ""apparently you do"".  Cracked me up, but the mask went up.  We will also walk down the middle of the street to give people space.  I love my hometown."

Washington state and Maine are both subject to seasonal weather where self absorption leads to big problems. In the sunbelt people can be self centered and oblivious of others with less likely bad outcomes.
2021-03-11 19:53:28,"So why has Los Angeles (201 deaths/100k) faired so poorly vs Seattle (64) and San Francisco (67) in spite of having similar lockdown measures?

I think it would be interesting to see the percent of the workforce in a metro area that has been able to work remotely alongside the deaths per 100k to see if there is any kind of correlation.

According to the data in the article below this may be a factor. Bellevue, a suburb of Seattle is #3 in the country for work from home ability. And Seattle is #9. A pretty significant 1-2 punch.  San Francisco is right in there at #11 in the country. 

While it doesn't mention Los Angeles specifically, the article mentions Ontario, a suburb of Los Angeles as being 5th worst in the nation for work from home ability.

I live in Bellevue right near Microsoft headquarters in Redmond. There is a lot less complaining about lockdown measures around me due in large part I think because most of my neighbors are still employed and getting paid. If more people could not work remotely and weren't getting paid I think there would be a lot more pushback.

2021-03-11 20:02:36,"Our success is certainly attributable to the decisions our community and government made to reduce transmission of the virus. I do wonder if our city culture played a small role as well. Seattleites can be quite introverted and insular — characteristics that some dub “the Seattle freeze.” (A bit of a stereotype, but with kernels of truth.) Some of us were quite comfortable with the concept of social distancing; if you were to invite my friends and me to a party in the before-times, there’s only a 50 percent chance we would have shown up at all. 

I am looking forward to this summer, when maybe we will see fewer buildings boarded up downtown. And I miss people-watching the tourists."
2021-03-11 19:54:59,"Fun to see this article commending Seattle. As someone who grew up in the Seattle area, and now works at one of the hospitals in the city, I am generally proud of how our city has handled this virus. However - we need to be a little careful in our self-congratulations. Sorry Seattle - love you, but we can be a little arrogant. We are just one city in Washington State. In the eastern part of the state, where we have a large number of Latinos working in agriculture, we failed to protect both our citizens and the H2A workers who come here yearly for the harvest season. We had at least three deaths (probably more) of H2A workers due to unsafe housing conditions. I love Washington and am proud of our general commitment to science. However we need to look at the rest of the state also before we get too self-congratulatory."
2021-03-11 20:00:14,"One of the things missing from Mr. Baker's article, is the fact that the University of Washington, in Seattle, had one of the first tests for SARS-CoV-2 in the nation.  US medical centers relied on the U of W for testing, after the CDC's initial assay failed. When I returned from Europe a year ago February, and after potential exposures a week later in Miami, I became as sick as a dog. I returned to New Haven, CT, a year ago today, where I was tested, and my serum had to go all the way out to the U of W to for testing. My results 3 days later, showed I was COVID-19 negative and my symptoms were due to a rhinovirus infection.  Testing was important and Seattle had it."
2021-03-11 20:36:46,"My impression, although I am unable to locate documentation, is that Seattle had one of the earliest and best COVID testing protocols anywhere. Tests were readily available and easily administered, and results were available quickly. I suspect that widespread and continued testing is the principal reason for Seattle's success."
2021-03-11 20:44:00,"This is the classic example of using anecdote to try to create policy. It is also a classic example of "" selection bias."" Seattle and SF both benefited from having economies where large numbers of the households are smaller and a very large percentage of the working population CAN WORK EFFECTIVELY FROM HOME!  I am MUCH MORE IMPRESSED by  Houston's death rate. A much larger metro, minority dominant population,  where so much of the population are essential workers who couldn't work from home and where draconian lockdowns like those in Seattle and SF were not instituted. An honest analysis would want to find how Houston in spite of some intrinsic disadvantages, has done so well."
2021-03-11 20:50:13,"It has been really nice to live in a place where most people take reasonable precautions as a given. Seattle (even though it's blue) is also quite conservative - just check out our local newspaper. Even so, conservatism here doesn't correlate with defiance and a lack of concern for others. We've all managed to stay on the same page regarding covid because it shouldn't have been politicized in the first place. Inslee deserves a lot of the credit for leading by example in a calm and encouraging way."
2021-03-11 20:59:59,"Seattle has been my home for more than 30 years, yet I still feel like a transplanted New Yorker. People here are more likely to be ""fake nice"" than ""in your face,"" which in normal times can be tiresome for someone like me -- but during a pandemic, it's highly adaptive behavior!

Joking aside, Seattle has a highly educated population that values health, fitness, and the outdoors much more than people in other places I've been. We also tend to be courteous, so the 6-foot rule (which results in long lines to get into specialty food stores) has been observed with minimal complaint over the past 12 months. 

In addition, the Republican species is rarely encountered here. (Our local elections are non-partisan, which in effect means that most candidates for office are some flavor of Democrat -- the trick is figuring out which flavor.)  I have no doubt that our citywide rejection of Republican ideology has been a  key factor in our success, though it may simply be an effect of those other things I mentioned -- education, mutual respect, environmental consciousness, and a focus on good health."
2021-03-11 21:05:13,"Thanks and kudos to Gov Inslee, KC Executive Constantine, and Mayor Durkan! 

As a resident, I’m grateful for the leadership here. I’ll never forget that frightening day at the end of February 2020 when a colleague I did not know told me that there was only one death so far in our state, and I had to correct her, no there have been 10 just reported this morning from a nursing home in Kirkland. We started mandatory work from home a few days later."
2021-03-11 21:10:59,"As a Seatttleite, it's been amazing how people here took the effort to wear masks all the time outside their homes or cars very seriously and it worked! Every store requires masks to enter and no one would think of going in to buy groceries or shop anywhere without a mask on. It's been the sane way to deal with the pandemic and it worked. People have been very kind to each other too and offered to help when people needed it and couldn't get out. Governor Inslee has been a truly inspiring leader and always made us feel like our efforts would pay off. Great article on Seattle!"
2021-03-11 21:16:33,"I was eating in a bar on March 11th in Wallingford (Seattle neighborhood) when everything started shutting down.  I teach just a few miles away from the nursing home where the first case was discovered, and I was slated to fly to NYC in early April for a trip.  Seattle shut its bars and restaurants around March 15th and I watched in horror as NYC kept theirs open. Many local restaurants shifted to take out food and there was a big push to buy local.  The Seattle Times has regular features about the best take-out food. I'm proud of Seattle's residents for believing in science,  masking up, and thinking of others beyond themselves.  Governor Inslee should have vaccinated teachers earlier, but overall I've been impressed with his leadership."
2021-03-11 21:21:17,"The other thing that helped Seattle is the Seattle Freeze, which is the social phenomenon where native or long-time residents are cold and distant to newer residents of the area, preferring to exhibit fake politeness instead of sincere kindness.  This reduces the desire to socialize, even when there isn’t a pandemic.

So I’m with the commenter that is more impressed with Houston’s numbers than Seattle’s.  Just due to the nature of our industry mix, nature of most employed people’s work in the area, and the inherent culture, Seattle was going to be a place with fewer deaths anyways."
2021-03-11 21:26:27,"Clearly, it appears as if the Seattle area has done a lot of things right so far, as has the San Francisco Bay Area.  The early restrictions in the Bay Area counties were notable at a time when little was being done across most of the nation, and while there have been some protests, I think most have seen the wisdom of our health leaders' ways and those protests have waned.  I have great hopes that the death and hospitalization rates will continue to fall as vaccination proceeds, even if the more contagious variants cause another peak among younger groups not yet jabbed.  But I also think that there is an underlying element of relative prosperity, underlying health, housing density, and other characteristics that favor these regions."
2021-03-11 22:21:48,"I also suspect that the first iteration of the virus spread around WA before the US was aware that Covid was in our midst, so many in our state were infected early with a less lethal version of the virus. Many people I knew or heard about had a ""hard flu"" in January and February, so there was some level of immunity already in the population before the more virulent versions such as the UK variant spread to our state. Just an observation, but if correct it would have helped keep the WA numbers low."

2021-03-11 22:10:52,"trump is a murderer.
trump is responsible for his crime of involuntary manslaughter in his criminally negligent response to the threat posed by the trumpvirus (aka SARS-CoV-2) that has resulted in the deaths of over 500,000 Americans from the trump Plague (aka COVID-19). trump is also guilty of committing 2nd degree murder by deliberately holding trumpvirus superspreader events, including trump Me!Me!Me! rallies, which resulted in the death of Herman Cain and others.
People who voted for trump, or a candidate who supports trump, in the 2020Nov03 election, are accessories after the fact to trump's crimes of involuntary manslaughter and 2nd degree murder.
trump needs to be prosecuted in a court of law for his crimes of involuntary manslaughter and 2nd degree murder.

2021-03-11 20:50:00,"Finally an article that reports death stats on a per capita basis.

Sometimes the simplest answers are the most accurate."
2021-03-11 20:33:17,"The weird thing is that this is not news. We knew this a year ago. Because infections grow at an exponential rate, knowing today's rate accurately predicts the numbers two weeks out. Seattle did everything right, and, as expected, saved more lives and is recovering sooner and better than areas the ignored the reality and opened too soon. Not looking forward to hearing the results from Texas!"
2021-03-11 20:35:34,"Having moved from Portland during the pandemic, I am quite envious of how low COVID-19 cases are in the PNW. East Coast politicians are very loud in our news, but the West Coast is actually putting the work in."
2021-03-11 21:18:45,Seattle is an end of the road location with Canadian closure . Like Miami and Maine they should do better just based on transit.
2021-03-11 20:48:32,"As has been noted in other comments, Seattlites are a highly educated, affluent lot with a strong belief in science, and these attributes surely have much to do with the Seattle Covid success story. 

But also at work here, I believe, are the exceptionally strong community ties in Seattle (neighbors look out for neighbors, and a stranger is a friend you haven't met yet). Perhaps due to this remarkable sense of community, and the city's strong Asian and Scandinavian influences, Seattlites are extremely respectful and deferent with one another. Seattle living is the opposite of a rat race. For instance, drivers let you in instead of cutting you off, and traffic ""weavers"" going 90 mph are unheard of. Folks do not bump into you in stores. And if you lose your hat, it'll probably be hanging on a branch somewhere along the route you walked. Lost your cell phone? Soon someone in your call list will get a call to inform you how to be reunited with your cell. 

With Covid, Seattlites have simply acted like Seattlites: they have really, really looked out for each other."
2021-03-11 21:27:07,"Too many places got the dynamic wrong. In hindsight it is clear that there was never any other way. First solve the pandemic and then rescue the economy. Respond to the pandemic like the natural disaster that it is. The nation needlessly lost hundreds of thousands, because the Former Guy administration cared only about the economy and its impact on their own re-election."
2021-03-11 21:41:41,"Surely an educated citizenry should be able to understand this paradox, for future challenges. Public health measures will inevitably be followed by one of two responses: (1) we should have done more/earlier - so many needless deaths/infections, OR (2)we did too much and suffered unnecessarily- look how few people got sick/died while we suffered in so many ways.  As another commenter notes, when (2) leads to “only” 2500 dead in a year, and a couple hundred thousand cases - of whom maybe some 10s of thousands may still be suffering after effects - then you can confidently say (2) is the better problem to have. Keep hanging in there Seattlites. Glad we have your example, as we seem unable to even imagine the even better but (?) more culturally “distant”  example of places like Hong Kong, Vietnam, Australia, New Zealand."
2021-03-11 21:06:41,"""If the rest of the United States had kept pace with Seattle, the nation could have avoided more than 300,000 coronavirus deaths.""

Our people--Jenny Durkan, Dow Constantin, Jay Inslee--did a good job here. Imagine how much better this would have gone for our country, had somebody like Inslee been president. 

That said, there were things we could have done better. We have done too much testing in wealthier areas of Seattle and its suburbs, but not enough testing in less wealthy areas like south Seattle. Like every other state and country around the world, we did not adequately protect our elderly. Too many of our local companies that were under Republican management did not do the smart thing, and consequently folks needlessly got sick or died. Republican counties and regions in the state, under the un-leadership of nutty Republicans, told the usual lies, ignored the science, and subsequently caused many needless deaths, e.g., the Yakima and Spokane regions. Those deaths included too many innocent farm workers. Finally, we are only now beginning to give our essential workers hazard pay--which we should have done from the get go."
2021-03-11 20:58:13,"I give our governor, Jay Inslee, a great deal of credit.  
When he first spoke on March 13, 2020, he was measured and sensible; there was definitely a 'can do' vibe.

Within weeks of the first shutdown (3/16/20), I knew of two people dead of COVID-19; one was a family friend of many years, and had seemed very healthy.  After that shocker, watching the madness and propaganda in the rest of the nation, and out of The Former Guy in the White House, was emotionally exhausting.

In mid-November, when Inslee shut the state down again, he emphasized the impacts to the entire state, and let health care professionals give their perspective.  He also made *very* clear that his decision was prompted by the rising number of cases around the state, and showed the graphs. That made it easier to face the prospect of Zoom Thanksgiving, followed by Zoom Christmas.

I know people who loathe Inslee and want to blame him for every bad event of 2020.  In my experience, these people have never held public office, nor been legally responsible for a business.  And they get 95% of their information from social media.

I credit Inslee, in conjunction with very smart WA-based business leaders, for the fact that so many of us have made it through this pandemic.  (I'm close to getting the vaccine and am almost giddy at the prospect.)

Leadership matters.
Inslee deserves a great deal of credit, IMVHO.
He's a workhorse, not a show horse."
2021-03-11 20:21:02,"There are some wildly uninformed comments in this section. They claim that Seattle (and similar cities') success are due to demographic homogeneity, not to things like public policy and good leadership. Well, Toronto is probably the most demographically heterogeneous city in North America, and its death rate per 100,000 is much lower than even that of Seattle or San Francisco.

Of course, things are worse in denser, poorer, higher-minority neighborhoods, but even these are nowhere near their counterparts in the US. 

As is so often the case, references to the USA would greatly benefit from comparisons with other richer countries, starting with its neighbor to the north."
2021-03-11 20:49:58,Should also be noted that Seattle - King County Public Health department has historically been lauded as one of the top local public health departments in the nation. Probably better funded and staffed than a lot of other local public health agencies too!
2021-03-11 22:10:43,"I grew up in the Puget Sound. Every time I return home via SeaTac when I leave the airport, there is a sign encouraging seatbelt use. It says: “Buckle up! It’s OUR law.” When I return to Minneapolis and leave the airport here there is a sign that says “Buckle up! It’s THE law.” How those two signs make me feel is really pronounced. If I haven’t already put on my seatbelt, I immediately do it in Seattle and I remind myself the public safety benefits for the community and for me when I engage in this behavior. When I leave MSP, I feel scolded and under threat. 

That attitude that it is OUR community. Our law. Our health. This inclusive and collaborative attitude might help explain why the state managed the crisis better."
2021-03-11 21:00:31,"As a person who falls outside the criteria for vaccination I feel inslee won the quarantine but the gears feel stuck regarding vaccination. Other states’ vaccination criteria is far lower so I wonder did WA. perhaps  do too good a job making us less eligible for inventory? Also the honor system, self reporting underlying conditions vs any verification is ripe for manipulation. Meanwhile I wait my turn as it’s the right thing to do."
2021-03-11 21:00:19,"I'm curious how the diversity of a city's population plays into its residents' willingness to comply, if at all. Seattle's population distribution is different from that of many other major cities in other regions of the country, and those populations have a different historical experience with American government and culture. Because the city has been so badly damaged by the amount of social unrest there, I can't help but wonder how their health initiatives succeeded while their social ones failed. How could the communication across diversity succeed so well in one area and fail so miserably in others? I don't imply any answer here. I don't have one."
2021-03-11 21:31:54,"I think a constellation of factors at play in Seattle’s relative success— a top-notch academic medical center that developed a successful test for Covid19 (whose first use was actually delayed by the CDC) & which had trained providers throughout the region to be aware of potential pandemic risks for decades (I am a UW trained MD).The first recognized case, followed by the early tragedy at the Kirkland SNF, awoke others to risk & so more people mostly adhered to mask mandates & social distancing— while this is partially because some could do so, working remotely & living in smaller households, such relative privilege doesn’t encompass our whole community or account for the willingness to adhere to masks or distancing. The woman staying in a shelter who panhandles in my neighborhood wears a mask; she believed early in the risk & threat to her wellbeing, speaking about it, as does the young man living in his car. Political leadership listened to scientists & medical providers, albeit at risk to their popularity and careers, acting to protect lives & to try to balance that caution with livelihoods, speaking consistently & clearly. The credence given the threat, followed by clear, consistent communication & action by my community leaders & local press I think vital. I could believe what I was hearing, even if I wanted more specifics.Looking across cities, states, regions, or countries responding to Covid19, I believe that’s salient. Be honest & real. Act early, together. Masks up!"
2021-03-11 22:41:32,"Seattle has followed the Science from the beginning.  Let's not forget that Doctor Helen Chu bravely had flu nasal swipes tested for Covid BEFORE receiving government approval to do so starting February 25th, 2020. She found the second known case in the nation at the time on a hunch, in a high school kid in Mill Creek, north of Seattle. His parents were contacted and stopped him from attending class 2/28 when he arrived at school because he was feeling better.  The high school was immediately shut down for a deep cleaning for a couple of days, and many kids and adults in the community voluntarily started wearing masks in the community well before the mandate.  This was BEFORE the cases in the nursing home in Kirkland were tied to Covid.  Dr. Chu deserves a lot of praise for following her hunch and the science, as do many of our fantastic health professionals and officials in Seattle."
2021-03-11 22:51:29,"I am very proud of Seattle, our governor and health officials, and the business leaders at the tech companies (who started the ball rolling on stay home stay safe by sending their workers to work from home).  But, we are now failing our school children, lagging behind others cities even as we are in the CDC yellow zone in which our schools should open. Seattle Public Schools and the teachers union have not even managed to bring back in person children with intensive special needs, who cannot learn remotely. Our children deserve better from us."
2021-03-11 23:30:26,You are being unfair to Mayor Breed and Governor Newsom.  San Francisco COVID rates are almost as low as Seattle's.  Its not fair to compare the State of California to Seattle.  It is very annoying when a writer's column ignores its own graphic.
2021-03-11 23:44:52,"It’s great for Seattle to have these fabulous numbers. However, I noticed that NYC, that the worst possible outcomes in the US has pretty been a dead city since March, stores and restaurants are either closed or at reduced capacity, office people work from home, same in New Jersey! It is hard to compare different cities and regions with different demographics, not to mention that everything started in NY. So I am not sure what to make out of it. Furthermore, some European countries, such as France, with drastic lockdown and curfews at 6 pm, have terrible statistics!"
2021-03-11 23:43:19,"Interesting. As a resident of Seattle proper, for the most part people I’ve noticed on many walks and trips to the grocery and hardware stores over the past year, people still mask up and give plenty of space. The accompanying graphic is fine - basically a table sorted by the listed metro regions’ size. But I wonder if a second graphic, maybe a simple dot-plot sorted by the death rates per 100k by region from greatest to smallest might also have been appropriate to include. The death rate was the main topic of the story, and such a graphic would tell the reader several things. In a glance it would show: that the hardest hit region had a death rate close to 5X higher than the lowest;  several regions in ‘red’ states actually had death rates which were less than the median for the compared regions (density?); and as others mentioned, the San Francisco Bay Area metro region had a death rate not much higher than Seattle’s. 
Aside from Portland (Vancouver B.C. doesn’t count in this scenario due to an all-but-closed border) the next really large urban region is San Francisco, about 800 miles away. 
Draw a circle on a map with an 800 mile radius and place the center in NYC. Most Northeastern cities would be enclosed. So would many Rust Belt cities and Chicago. My guess is with COVID distance helps. 
Ironically, one of the reasons given when our local airplane company moved its headquarters to Chicago was Seattle was just too far away.

2021-03-12 01:01:03,"“The high humidity may have helped, scientists say, “

A Japanese supercomputer proved that humidity helps slow the viral spread. Humidity makes the virus heavier and any exhaled virus falls quickly to the ground.This might also explain why levels of viral infection were so low in NYC between June and October. It might also explain why Florida and Georgia were able to weather coronavirus better than was expected even though they basically kept most things open."
2021-03-12 00:46:57,"This is a silly silly article.  No one knows the reasons why one region does better than another,  and the argument that stringency of arbitrary restrictions --- or the willingness of the population to obey --- is the determining factor is tenuous at best.    Just look at the data in the article.  California had restrictions every bit as strict as Washington, yet Los Angeles  nevertheless suffered a very high death rate.  And the Tampa-St. Petersburg area has approximately the same death rate as the San Diego area, even though Florida has been castigated for its ""reckless""   approach.  

Finally, while it's certainly true in general that the less contact people have with each other the less the virus will spread, it is also true that the virus will keep spreading until it runs out of people to infect.  In the absence of a vaccine then,  infection rates will rise once restrictions are eased, unless a community remains in permanent lockdown (or somehow the virus can be indefinitely contained)."
2021-03-12 00:52:54,San Francisco Metro Area did essentially just as well.
2021-03-11 21:50:33,"Seattle's Covid deaths per million is 640.  That's almost twice the global average C19 deaths per million rate of 338.  

That's abysmally bad.  

Obviously all that mask wearing and lockdown compliance did absolutely nothing at all - exactly like everywhere else, and exactly what every one of the rigorous studies concluded.

Every single RCT and meta-analysis found zero significant effect from mask and lockdown compliance (and they would have found something if it existed).   The Lancet published two of these studies.  Since you breathe from the sides, top, and bottom of these masks, why would anyone expect them to work?

In no country in the world did the onset of mask mandates bend the transmission curve whatsoever.  Same with lockdowns and border closures.  No effect at all.

Instead, the media pushes worthless correlation/observational studies (pseudoscience) and calls it a day.  Not one of these associational studies was corroborated with the more rigorous studies designed to wash out their confounders.  

There is no policy-level (scientific) evidence that Seattle's compliance did anything at all — and their abysmal 640 D/M is empirical proof.

What happened is the Virus reached it's environmental carrying capacity, just like every other virus, and fell back down to equilibrium.  It's not magic, it's science."
2021-03-12 03:29:02,"The article implies downtown Seattle is suffering economic consequences brought on by public health measures to control coronavirus, which is true, but they were not necessarily dictated by the Governor or Mayor.  The shutdown of the cruise ship industry especially, hurt downtown businesses like the Pike Place Market. It is the social unrest of last summer, plus the pre-pandemic problems of drug dealing on street corners and homelessness which have taken a toll on the retail core.  There are plenty of people shopping and eating in restaurants at the outdoor mall near my neighborhood. Wearing masks and social distancing of course."
2021-03-12 04:40:50,It is little surprise that the areas with the lowest rates currently were initially the areas of highest incidence. The general populace circulation was exceptional and in no small way a great contributor to the present virus resistance we can observe.

The economic and social costs have been painful, but as Jeff Duchin said, there's no coming back from the coroner's office.  We have watched in horror as other states where friends live have opened prematurely, only to suffer high illness and death rates, and done so repeatedly.  It's a tragedy that we had a president for the first year whose response to the pandemic was to ignore it."

2021-03-12 05:15:30,"I find this article patently unfair to Governor Gavin Newsom and Mayor London Breed.  The latter has, in fact, been a model.  The death rate per 100,000 was essentially the same in San Francisco and Seattle, despite the former having an older population and a larger percentage of its residents living in close quarters.  Despite a purported shortage of test kits, nearly 1.6 million residents have been tested here, which is the equivalent of almost 2x our population.  Our positivity rates are among the lowest in the nation.  Only about 40 people are hospitalized now with Covid-19 and these include transfers from rural counties and the state's prison system.  Never did we fall below 23% excess capacity.  Fewer than 450 people have died of the Coronavirus here.  And now vaccinations are rolling out apace.  Where did Mayor Breed fall short?  Also when talking about California's record, one has to adjust it for population.  Last time I looked at the Times' graphics, California is ranked 18th for cases per 100,000 and 28th for deaths per 100,000.  And one has to consider California is a ""tale of two states"".  Southern California is more akin to Southern Texas than Northern California.  L.A., Orange, San Diego, San Bernandino and Riverside Counties account for over 60% of the state's cases and 2/3 of its deaths.  Mask mandates and social distancing guideline were honored only in their breach.  A former associate there can't wait to move back to his native Oregon."
2021-03-12 05:38:26,"Much credit goes to Seattle leaders and people who obeyed common sense.  I'm in Seattle now and glad I found myself here as opposed some nonsense place in the south that denied science.  However, other factors are at play as many other comments state, and I'm adding a few other general observations:  many, if not most people here live in single family homes and have the luxury of physical separation from others, there is a lot of open space in Seattle and suburbs, and very few take public transportation; i.e., chances of transmission decrease, people are dreary in general and do not socialize even in good times, they love to do their own thing and COVID didn't challenge their predominantly isolationist lifestyle, tech industry is literally the main industry which already supported remove work..."

2021-03-12 09:14:26,"perhaps it had to do with the fact that a Seattle suburb (Kirkland) had the first documented cases in the nation.  it put us into a state of shock as the well publicized Kirkland nursing home became a superspreader location.

we experienced the first wave of fatal reality of this coronavirus, and as such, i am proud that the Seattle region/King County has maintained low numbers relative to other areas."
2021-03-12 07:48:58,"Before draw too many policy conclusions, consider for a moment that death isn't a simple as 1 in some number but is a function of population size. 

Now take out Excel and do a scatter plot using population and number of deaths. Add a trend line. The city below the line did better than expected by population size alone and the the ones above did worse. 

Seattle did better but so different from San Francisco, Houston, Washington DC and  Dallas."
2021-03-12 06:43:14,"The article highlights Seattle’s successes in managing Covid. Well done to that beautiful city, and I hope things pick up rapidly. 

(The comments, by contrast, illuminate why the US as a whole, has done so badly: fractious opinions, failure to consider evidence, hubris over caution, exceptionalism.)"
2021-03-12 06:17:29,"This article understates our success here in Seattle. Because of our superior political leadership, which provided clear, accurate public health information, we actually beat this virus, completely, by mid-summer 2020.

Yep, we made the initial strain from Wuhan EXTINCT, because almost all of us wore masks and follow the social distancing rules. That's how you starve a virus to death. It's simple: isolation and containment. It always works.

Only the repeated reintroductions of new virus (the European strain first introduced in New York) coming in from out of state has kept us from totally defeating this thing. (I'm referencing  a peer-reviewed scientific paper right now. Google for a few minutes and you'll find it.)

The tragedy of this century is that  if every state had followed our lead, we ALL could have defeated this pandemic in about 90 days, as Donald Trump's CDC head explained repeatedly over the summer. All we had to do was wear masks. We wouldn't have had to wait for this vaccine. We'd have been back to normal in August.

This is not a secret, by the way. it's what other countries did, last year. it worked.

But sadly, one guy in DC decided masks were bad, because he's literally incapable of caring about other people, didn't see any benefit to himself, and more importantly, he thought wearing a mask made him look weak, which he cannot handle.

The reality is, a lot more than 300,000 American lives could have been saved, if the country had not been misled."
2021-03-12 09:54:45,"Seattle's response to the pandemic was quite a bit like the response I saw here in Thailand. The Covid 19 death rate over the course of the pandemic has been 1,500 time less than the US average. It's not rocket science. Fast action by public health authorities, and consistent messaging do the trick. Add near universal masking to the mix from day one, and the result could have been hundreds of thousands lives saved in the USA. But outside of the brave leaders in Seattle, America was in full Trump mode during the first eleven months of this pandemic."
2021-03-12 10:16:59,"The COVID-19 data for total cases in Washington counties published on November 17, 2020 can separated according to whether Trump or Biden won in each county. The twenty-six counties in which Trump won had 53,087 total cases and a population of 1,963,967. The thirteen counties in which Biden won had 76,450 cases and a population of 5,650,926. The number of cases per 10,000 residents was 270.3 for Trump counties and 135.3 for Biden counties. Trump’s leadership is producing twice the number COVID cases where he dominates the electorate. Truth or Consequences is not just a outdated game show."

As one who's had the good fortune to spend quite a bit of time down-under, note that much (approximately half) of Queensland more than 'makes a stand-in for the tropics,' as it lies north of the Tropic of Capricorn (i.e., is in the tropics). Oh yeah, almost certain the 'multicolored parrots' reference are the spectacular and seemingly ubiquitous Rainbow Lorikeets."
2021-03-10 20:15:58,"I live in Tasmania, the island state south of mainland Australia. We have had 232 virus cases in total. Currently, we have no active cases of the virus.  In almost a year, there has been no community transmission of cases, 3 cases identified in people who were in quarantine upon returning to the state and 1 case of a person who was hospitalised and quarantined after returning from receiving medical treatment in another state.  The only place you are required to wear a mask is at the airport where every traveller is screened.  We are fortunate and we owe our good fortune to our state and federal governments that worked in accord to protect us and to people’s willingness to comply with public health and safety directives.  Contrary to how this article makes it seem, there is not much complaining going on.  

But the visitors to our country are right about the birds.  In my southern state we don’t have lorikeets but we do have colourful rosellas and flocks of beautiful pink and grey galahs.  We have lots of sulphur-crested and yellow-tailed black cockatoos and corellas. Our animals are great, too.  On my property we have bandicoots, quolls, echidnas and Tasmanian devils.  So, for those who come to make a movie, you are welcome to come, follow the public health rules, and enjoy our country.  Others will have to wait until borders are opened."
2021-03-10 20:37:28,"Alternative universes don't just happen. It was a concerted effort, with governments holding fast against the cranky extreme libertarians and doing pragmatic, sensible things. It was also very expensive - money needed to go to support people who were staying home."
2021-03-10 20:39:18,"There have been a lot of lessons coming out of this pandemic. Firstly, the responses of governments: Each one had the opportunity to earn the trust of the majority of its citizens through its initial response in February/March of last year. Australia took an extremely hard line approach and earned that trust and continued compliance. Countries such as the UK & the US didn't and the opportunity was lost. One can argue the rights and wrongs from all kinds of economic and health perspectives.

The power of money has been another insight. If there was ever any doubt before, the masses are going to struggle with future environmental events, food and water shortages and plagues. But, as in so many dystopian movies, there are going to be going those that calmly solve their problem with a money transfer."
2021-03-10 21:28:38,"With all the problems our country and our planet is facing, it’s highly irritating to read about wealthy celebrities being able to just hop and skip to locations that suit their fancy.  All the while, altering the economic, social and environmental ecosystems wherever they land no doubt.  Makes me think less of everyone involved."
2021-03-10 21:40:12,"Writing as someone who works in the film and TV industry, this American influx is great... if you work in what's called 'below the line' which is the part of the crew who offer general production services. Both state and federal governments are offering very, very generous financial incentives to some very big US corporations like Disney - like multiple tens of millions of dollars - to come and film here. Yep, it creates a lot of production jobs. 
'Above the line' is where the IP resides and it covers directors and writers and producers; these are the people who create the stories (IP) and who actually generate the productions. To quote John Sayles, 'it all starts with the idea'. While our government is pumping loads of Aussie money into these US productions, none of it comprises local IP. 
Now, to be sure, the federal and state governments do have support for local film-makers, in fact more than most other countries and that has been consistent for decades. But recently we've seen a upswing of big taxpayer money going to big US studios who, frankly, don't need it. 
At the end of the day one has to ask: is this taxpayer money best spent on (ie) a Disney movie, Aussie dollars into LA coffers and: is that money not better spent on local film-makers? Local writers and directors so we can develop an even stronger base of storytellers?"
2021-03-10 21:45:05,"Sorry but this transplanted New Yorker has little sympathy for Australians ""stuck"" overseas. Many of them chose to head overseas last year for various personal reasons before the borders closed. They should have asked themselves if going to their brother's wedding in the UK would be worth the risk. And I say this as someone who went to the US in November 2019 when my mother was having a heart procedure. But I wouldn't have gone three months later. And I believe all the recent cases in Australia can be traced back to returned travellers in hotel quarantine with no community transmission for a while. So we cannot risk overloading the hotel quarantine system for now."
2021-03-10 22:17:00,"The shamelessness of the the government in Australia, both on the state and local level would be considered epic by American standards.  The fact that Australian citizens have no constitutional right to return to Australia from abroad and that the government would rather cater to the needs of Hollywood and tennis celebrities is just one tiny example."
2021-03-10 22:19:45,"Australians have worked hard to get to where we are in terms of the virus, a lot of sacrifices have been made and there are many for whom life will never be the same again.

It seems our reward for this will be a global influx of people and money chasing probably the most desirable place in the world to live today. This will bring with it significant rises in the cost of already expensive real estate and general cost of living.

On the one hand it is great to see this Hollywood boost to the local economies. On the other, we don't want to see the fabric of what Australia got right in this pandemic ripped apart by people and money wanting to ride on the back of our hard work."
2021-03-10 21:54:33,"Australia is definitely the lucky country with coronavirus but government management has given us our good luck. Strong government lockdowns where necessary, government support for people out of work because of the virus, strong compliance with mask wearing and social distance rules, and almost zero tolerance for crackpot libertarians of the Republican ilk who seem to thrive in coronavirus America. 

Good public health outcomes from supporting big government."

Fortunately, our leader (A devout Christian himself - Hillsong) wasn't required to pander to a ""base"" and was able to look beyond his faith and do what was best for the country as a whole.

Our total death toll is less than a third of the USA's daily carnage, and we have maybe several dozen active COVID cases, all of which are in quarantine.

Life here still wont get back to the old ""normal"" if it ever does, but I'll take where we are until I have been afforded the vaccine, after which we can think about opening borders to those also vaccinated.

2021-03-10 23:08:52,"The most important lesson to be learned from dealing with this pandemic is how vitally important it is to put the collective good ahead of the individualist needs or desires. 

That's why America will continue to suffer the worst of all industrialized nations with COVID because, as a nation, it seems to still believe in its ""exceptionalism"" and the belief that individual rights are more important than the collective rights and responsibilities of all.

America's combination of arrogance and ignorance will be the pathway to its own demise as a once great nation; once great for those who are white and wealthy, hardly ever great for those of color who are trying to survive, thrive, make a living and fighting to carve out a space amidst all of the inequities this country continues to exacerbate."

2021-03-10 22:17:03,"On the one hand, it is great that there are countries who have been spared the tragedies of the coronavirus. I applaud their government, or whoever was wise enough to keep the virus from taking hold.
On the other hand, it is vile that people are being kept from their own homeland. Others are free to bash them with the ""...well, they knew when they left...,"" but knowledge of the dangers of the virus was scant - and the information often contradictory - at certain points. So, unless we KNOW when these people left - and WHY - it is still tragic that they cannot return home. It's bad enough to be stuck at home, much less 10,000 miles away.

But really, rubbing salt in the wound by contrasting all this with the good fortune of celebrities? Did the NYTimes REALLY think this was a show of humanity? Or are they just the PR people for actors and actresses, since that is mainly whom you have chosen to highlight.
Next time, think twice. There is STILL a pandemic out there, and there are STILL THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE DYING EVERY DAY. Curb your insensitivity. (The caps are for emphasis, not anger. This is a time for sadness at the lives being lost, not anger. That won't bring people back to life. I'm simply astounded at whatever editor green lighted this  ""this-will-make-a-great-story"" stupidity.) You don't rub people's faces in it when a tragedy is still going on.

2021-03-10 22:08:10,"This alternative universe did not just happen by accident or due to our remoteness. Australians travel widely so the pandemic could easily have been as bad here. Melbourne had the worst of our countries COVID cases, prompting a lockdown lasting over 100 days where people could not venture further than 5km from their homes. As a nurse I spent 4 months of last year in full PPE despite only working on a screening ward, we only picked up a handful of cases a week, none in our last month. A screening hotel for returned travellers had cases in 2 of their workers a month ago, plunging the entire city into another lockdown for 5 days and capping the new outbreak to around 20 cases. 
This has been a concerted effort from a right wing national government and a left wing state government working largely in unison. Our state opposition leader tried criticising the lockdown last year, saying we would never get zero cases per day and we had to live with the virus, his approval rating now sits at around 15%. We had 3 months with zero cases before the current hotel outbreak, since we put a lid on that outbreak we’ve had 12 days virus free. 
It was simply a matter of listening to experts and our state leaders saying they were not doing what was popular but doing what was necessary, ironically it made them immensely popular. Western Australia has an election this week, their leader has an 88% approval rating with the opposition stating they are “hoping for a landslide rather than a wipeout”"

Entertainment is in full stride Down Under and in New Zealand as well, but here in the States we are timidly awaiting a period of limited seating. 

The wealthiest and most advanced nation in the world sits humiliated as other countries with a fraction of our resources return to normal life. Even worse, unlike them, we are burdened with anti-vaxxers nurtured by the previous administration and fake news.  Even if we come out of this pandemic plight completely by autumn, one wonders if the damage to the American psyche isn't permanent.

Ask New Zealand how much the Lord of the Rings franchise brought in terms of jobs to non stars, how it helps develop the NZ arts community and especially the tourism dollars.

But the revenue that will be generated from these productions and the tourism that will be generated from this free PR will end paying for a lot of the governments bills in the future.

especially the tourism dollars."

Newsflash America! North Queensland IS in the tropics!! So easy to Google.

2021-03-10 11:15:16,I am tired of the political nitpicking between parties.   They should stop.
2021-03-10 11:16:06,"To be fair, Trump helped to roll out the vaccines. But Trump downplayed the COVID-19 threat over and over. So the Trump scorecard should be less than zero, since his actions helped to cause 500,000 US deaths. The Biden scorecard is positive."
2021-03-10 11:17:45,"Trump created the pandemic by allowing 13,000 flights from Europe , after he had halted flights from China.
Give trump credit for causing the pandemic."
2021-03-10 11:19:49,"Trump absolutely forfeited any credit for his overall handling of the pandemic by his utter irresponsible leadership in advising the public how to behave before the vaccine had even been tested.  Now tens of thousands of Americans have died as a direct result of his criminal negligence. 

He literally ridiculed people for wearing masks at his rallies and was the worlds biggest superspreader of this disease.  The arrival of the vaccinations make his crimes clear.  So many who died could have been saved if our country had reacted with more caution to its danger.  Numbers don't lie. 

Many people have been legally executed in this country for causing a fraction of the human damage that this man wantonly inflicted on us. 

The media has let him off far too lightly."
2021-03-10 11:18:07,Who cares who gets credit. Childish mentality.
2021-03-10 11:38:29,"Trump denied the severity of the crisis likening it to the flu and diminishing the need for testing because it affected his polling numbers.

Biden has leveled with people, never underestimating the extent to which the pandemic can be reduced if we listen to the scientists.

Above all, Biden has a plan for fair  distribution of vaccines while Trump left it to a patchwork of states allowing GOP friends like Ron DeSantis, governor of Florida, to allocate vaccines to Republican strongholds based on zip codes."
2021-03-10 11:55:13,"If Donald Trump had acted more presidential and deferred to the medical experts he would have easily been re-elected.  And, thanks to Operation Warp Speed he would have emerged as the hero of the pandemic. 
His encouragement of the pharmaceutical industry do develop a vaccine in record time has undoubtedly saved a lot of lives. 
In fact, if the public were not so biased against him, he would be up for the  Nobel Prize for Operation Warp Speed and ultimately the millions of lives that will be saved world wide. 

Unfortunately his behavior has alienated a great number of people.  But, that does not diminish the great work that he has done in ultimately conquering this pandemic.  Joe Biden will get the credit, but Donald Trump and his administration will have laid the ground work."
2021-03-10 11:47:28,"You must be kidding. Trump was offered millions of Pfizer doses and turned them down last summer. Then embargoed shipments to other countries to get them back. His team distributed vaccine according to voting maps - look at PA - the 4 most populous suburbs of Philly vastly under-served and smaller counties that were Trump red got way too much. Who do I blame on this? Trump or the PA Governor? But in any case the case loads were far far higher than they had to be because of Trump denial, and many yens, if not hundreds of thousands, of people died who didn't need to . I don't give a fig about ""Operation Warpspeed"" give that Trump's family and likely his buddies made a ton of money in the process."
2021-03-10 12:10:16,"The real work behind the nRNA vaccines for Covid was ""30 years of painstaking research,"" according to the Harvard Medical School. 
That research - basic science of the type the the Trump administration consistently fought, and tried to de-fund - gets most of the credit. Scientists were able to quickly build a specific vaccine based on it."
2021-03-10 12:16:31,"There is a simple way to assign credit. The Trump administration took steps to appear effective during the pandemic. these were real concrete steps whose goal was to reassure America by accelerating the development of the vaccine. 
The Biden administration took steps to be effective in fighting the pandemic by planning implementing and enhancing the distribution of the vaccine, and regularizing prevention."
2021-03-10 12:17:28,"I don't care who gets credit. I just want to get a vaccine. I'm in a high priority group and can't get an appointment. In fact, there are NO vaccines currently available in my state at all, and that's been true for some time. I've spent weeks on those sites, and I keep getting texts from my health care state group saying I'm eligible and please make an appointment--but there are no appointments, no vaccines. And yet they've now opened up the number who are eligible. That means when something does eventually become available, there will be twice as many people vying for those limited appointments."
2021-03-10 11:33:12,"Donald Trump got to take credit for President Obama's economic success, so therefore Joe Biden gets to take credit for Donald Trump's vaccine success.  Presidents always take credit for what their predecessors did well."
2021-03-10 11:48:24,Here’s the thing.  None of us care where the credit goes.  We just want to move on from the tribalism and have our government work.  We’re paying for it after all.
2021-03-10 12:13:32,"This assumes that we wouldn't be at this stage of the rollout regardless of who was president. 

Biden has denied he was left with a rollout plan, despite the director of the NIH's comments that there was a plan ready to go once the vaccine arrived.

Efforts to diminish the accomplishment of getting a vaccine out within a year will continue, but the fact remains, as the NIH director acknowledge, it's ""remarkable."""
2021-03-10 12:00:02,"You can be sure of one thing. If Trump would have found out about efforts to ensure adequate vaccine production he would have only been concerned about how to message that in order to help himself politically or financially. That is the bottom line. If it didn't help him he simply wasn't interested.

While a few in his administration may have seen the value in securing vaccines and in their distribution, Trump decided to get vaccinated in private so as to not interfere with his underlying message of it all being a hoax. Did he not say that the crisis would be magically over on November the 5th if he lost, and that the media and the democrats were blowing it all out of proportion?

Sorry, but the meager attempts of the prior administration to make an ineffectual minimal effort, while leaving the states to fend for themselves cannot be excused, regardless of self-shaming journalism."
2021-03-10 11:50:26,"Let's not forget that he quietly got the vaccine before he left, still insisting that this was hype and overblown. Him getting a public vaccine would have prompted many of his skeptical anti tax/anti mask people to do the same. He didn't cause the pandemic. He very successfully did everything he could to magnify and worsen its effects - resulting in hundreds of thousands of deaths that were preventable. This is the only credit he is due. Drug companies actually should be getting the credit."
2021-03-10 12:09:11,Does anyone believe that the vaccine rollout would have been as organized and effective as it is if Trump were still in office?  No way. He gets zero credit especially since he made the situation worse than it could have been.
2021-03-10 12:05:15,"Combine competence with altruism, and you get a Biden administration. Combine rampant selfishness with an innate disregard for decency, and you get a Trump administration.

While there were a few ""pixels"" of clarity and right-mindedness during the Trump administration efforts to address the pandemic at Warp Speed, the larger picture was a bleak one. With the Biden team in place, we may begin to see the light."
2021-03-10 11:50:46,"ALL of the vaccine credit goes to the bioscientists, pharmaceutical companies, contractors, logistics & healthcare professionals.

THEY invented, developed, tested, manufactured, distributed, and administered the vaccines. Yes, federal/state oversight and invoking the Defense Production Act helped smooth the path to success, but it is the hundreds of thousands of silent professionals who quietly have done — and are doing — amazing work. 

Everything else is just noise."
2021-03-10 11:42:24,"He may have put pressure on the pharma companies to produce, but what this article misses is the Trump administration’s total abdication of responsibility for the logistics of delivery. Typical of Trump in every way: Bark at subordinates and avoid any strategic involvement, details or follow up. The last time Trump rolled up his sleeves on any issue was...never."
2021-03-10 11:46:35,"In my opinion, the Trump administration's biggest vaccine failure was lack of a robust plan to administer the vaccines, and their ""leave it to the States"" mantra. For a year, we knew that a vaccine was coming, that covid-19 was a lethal threat which required the fastest possible immunization blitz, yet we wasted months that could have been used to set up mass vaccination centers with the required personnel, supplies, and protocols, including digital platforms. I believe that, in spite of Biden's heroic efforts, we are still playing catch up. We are still paying the price for the incompetence of the Trump Administration."
2021-03-10 11:23:50,"With all due respect, how many US citizens died from covid-19 under the Trump administration and the Republican Party's control of states owing to non-best medical and scientific practice but from political concerns?  Tell the Trump administration as well as the Republican Party to go to the end of the line.  Honest history will not be kind to them."
2021-03-10 11:28:53,"This is rich, considering Trump didn't hesitate to take credit for the Obama administration's economic recovery and strength.

The pandemic is vastly worse because of the Trump's blunders. If his administration did some things right with the vaccine rollout, that's small solace after he got so many people killed."
2021-03-10 12:16:20,It took years of work for scientists to lay the groundwork needed to develop the vaccines so quickly. Hard to imagine something Trump deserves less credit for.
2021-03-10 12:14:33,"Note that neither Trump nor Biden personally did much at all. It was the bureaucrats, scientists, and company managers who made all this happen."
2021-03-10 11:43:01,"Please don’t compare the two administrations. Biden administration is focused on strictly getting the vaccine to as many Americans as possible in the quickest time. Trump personally had picked up feuds with Blue states and was determined to starve them off the vaccines if they spoke against his policies. 

It’s so refreshing to see the numbers and not Biden’s personal views dominate the headlines. The country can breathe and focus on important issues."
2021-03-10 11:29:45,"Sometimes it is in the way that people present themselves and in the deeds surrounding the activity that color the entire situation.  Trump is for Trump.  No sane person will deny that.  But as the country entered its most deadly surge of the virus he expended more energy on trying to stay in office and at any cost.  He lost all interest in the vaccine after the election.  Hundreds of thousands of people died as he railed against the election process.  So, if you had any doubts where he expended his energy look no further.

His staff followed suit. They did everything possible to thwart the Biden’s team from transitioning.  That’s on them.  We would not be anywhere near this level of progress had he stayed in office.  We were on track to become one of his “failed business ventures” of which there are many.  But rest be assured he’d had made sure he made money on the deal.

I’ve been an independent voter since I turned 18, and I tried to give the guy a chance but he’s the worst leader I’ve seen in decades. And I’m not sure “leader” is even a term I would use to describe him at all."
2021-03-10 11:47:56,"This article points out that vaccine production had started under Trump and expanded with Biden. It fails to point out that the vaccine administration was handed off to the states and DC, without the needed technical and financial support. It has been reported that Pfizer offered Trump 100,000,000 more doses and he refused only to make a deal later for the extra doses. This contributed to the delay. The states have a myriad of vaccine registration websites and processes. As a practicing physician, I can attest that vaccine registration is a real challenge for my older patients who do not have internet or smartphones. Vaccine hesitancy was always going to be a problem, but the messaging from Trump was a disaster. ""Warp Speed"" itself has discouraged some of my patients. Fortunately, I can explain the science to those who have reached out to me or come in for a visit, or called up to speak to me. All this said, the reason vaccine rollout is a crisis, is the complete failure to control the virus  by Trump before the vaccines were available. Trump politicized masks and ridiculed those who wore them.The US has about 25% of the cases and 5% of the world population."
2021-03-10 12:10:41,"The arsonist who started the fire, then drove the fire truck to the fire doesn't get any credit for actually putting the fire out."
2021-03-10 11:32:42,"Frankly, vaccine or no vaccine, what will I remember about Donald Trump and COVID?  That Trump called it a hoax, that over 520,000 people, innocent people, have died so far from COVID, and many more have suffered from the consequences of them or loved ones having COVID.  I’ll remember the thousands of healthcare workers who have sacrificed to help with taking care of those thousands and thousands of COVID inflicted Americans.  

I’ll also remember Trump going on a LOA from Walter Reed to parade around in a government vehicle and wave to get recognition on a Sunday evening.  Memories of him standing by Amy Barrett who he counted on to save him in some way of the future, with no masks showing his little care.  Pictures of Trump and his maskless supporters, by the thousands, rallying, is haunting, the exposure.  And then Trump sneakily receiving the vaccine in January, unbeknownst to the public!  

Maybe Trump’s administration might have added a little to the COVID vaccine process, but he personally will certainly not be remembered for any great part in it.  Nor should he be.  He will be remembered as a COVID spreader."
2021-03-10 11:21:56,"Merck had its own vaccine candidate and announced that it failed on Jan 26th. Vaccine capacity becane available after that. A key data point missing from the article. Also missing from the article are multiple cross-company agreements to transfer vaccine manufacturing, such as Novartis-Pfizer, that had nothing to do with Biden, giving context the the Merck-JNJ agreement- Biden may have helped, by there is no evidence this wouldn't have happened without him."
2021-03-10 11:40:58,"Sure. 
Give Trump  credit for a surge in vaccine production, as long as you also credit him for hundreds of thousands of avoidable deaths and suffering.

This time last year he was engaged in a vicious campaign to disparage expertise, deny science and ignore facts.
He politicized the simple act of wearing a mask to protect others.
And fools followed his lead.

I’ll give him credit for my ‘long haul survivor ‘ friend who somehow contracted  Covid last April -when it was still a “hoax”.  She was on a vent for  14 days, in a rehab for 72, has declined lung function, and still has no use of her left leg. (COVID manifests in many ways) 
Nobody deserves more credit  than Trump."
2021-03-10 11:50:59,"If Trump wants to blow his horn about the vaccine, why did he get his own out of public view and has not made a public statement encouraging people to get it.  He touts himself as a great CEO, yet he doesn't want to be seen using his own product, nor does he advertise it.  Then he wonders why no one sees him as having achieved great success.  He is like the baseball star who hits a lot of home runs, but has a toxic personality and goes on a big slump.  The team trades him, then goes on to win the World Series.  And after it's over the traded guy stands up there and shouts ""They never would have won it without me"".  And expects a World Series ring.  Sorry, Don, I like Presidents who take pandemics seriously."
2021-03-10 11:57:28,"The very biggest and most positive difference between the two administrations is trump always acted like the pandemic was just an inconvenience for him. Throughout the whole year he just made false claims about how great he was doing while leaving the states to fend by themselves. In stark contrast President Biden took ownership of the situation right out of the gate. He told the bad news along with the good. He put doctor's and science in charge and worked with the states to roll out the vaccine. Trump fought the war with one hand behind his back, President Biden jumped in with both hands and feet."
2021-03-10 11:35:22,"How soon we forget!  What Trump laid the groundwork for was the surge of the Covid-19 pandemic in America.  One of Trump's answer to the growing health crisis was a bleach cocktail.  Along with denial, refusual to lead by wearing a mask and refuting the world of medical experts on the serious of the virus'by suggesting that it would be gone in weeks.  What Trump did do could not be considered helpful.   As noted members in his adminstration took actions to address what by then was killing thousands of Americans.  Hats off to those in that adminstration who did so and stood in opposition to   ""the previous guy""."
2021-03-10 12:16:22,"We will never know what Trump would have done had he won the election. Starting the research was a small step that he took out of guilt and self interest to calm the masses. He showed no inclination to shout it from the rooftops. If it were another time he would claim credit for the sunrises. 
Success has a thousand fathers, failures are orphans."
2021-03-10 11:28:54,"One question:  Did the Trump administration ever acknowledge the strong economy they inherited?  No, never."
2021-03-10 11:43:41,"Trump had 10 months between when he first knew about the virus until the first vaccine was available and what did he do? He golfed and said fighting the virus was not his responsibility and that he was leaving the distribution of the vaccine up to the states.

The man thought becoming president was all about going to London to see the Queen and getting to ride around in her gilded carriage  and had no clue about the responsibilities associated with the job.  Kind of like its fun to buy a casino and do a photoshoot of the ribbon cutting, but boring to actually do the daily work to make sure the business actually earns money."
2021-03-10 11:22:00,"This is a fairly balanced article by New York Times standards but even it omits two important facts. First, the Trump administration fast-tracked the vaccine approval process and committed funding to produce the vaccines before they were approved. Second, the Biden administration's 1.9 trillion dollar ""pandemic relief package"" soon to be signed into law provides more money to bail out multiple employer pensions than it allocates to vaccine production, distribution and infection tracking."
2021-03-10 12:12:52,We only have one president at a time.
2021-03-10 12:23:12,"The scientist and engineers, plus the logistics people and managers coordinating all of this, deserve all the credit for the success here.  And operation WARP speed did have its successes by implementing early funding --- that is true!

Now that we are picking up speed in the rollout, I hope that we will model the next great migration -- college kids coming home from school.  I am fearful this is another wave, and a lost opportunity to vaccinate many people in a dense setting quickly.  It would be perfect for the J&J product."
2021-03-10 12:23:50,"This article disproves its own headline and lede. It provides detailed accounts of how the Biden administration helped to dramatically increase vaccine production by Pfizer and Johnson & Johnson, and contrasts this with the ways in which the Trump administration hobbled progress at Pfizer. The only praise it reports for the Trump administration's actions is from a Trump administration official. The overall impression is that the Biden administration has consistently been very effective at helping companies to ramp up production, whereas the Trump administration was less helpful, and in some cases even hindered the effort."
2021-03-10 12:24:05,"The free market jump started vaccine development. What the Trump administration did was give that a minor boost by giving money to some companies, but not all. (IIRC, Pfizer did not get money because their vaccine was actually developed by BioNtech, a foreign company). The Trump administration then followed that ups with a single good thing: Fast FDA approval which, TBH, every administration ever, would have done under the circumstances. The administration then did everything possible to sabotage the vaccine rollout.
If the Trumpies want a crumb of credit, fine, but acting like they did all that much helpful, especially given the administration and GOP's historically, deliberately, fatally inept response to the pandemic, please, no. Over the course of nearly a year, that FDA approval is the only truly good, competent thing the administration did. Otherwise, it was all exacerbation of the pandemic."
2021-03-10 12:22:37,Trump claimed victory on the economy off of Obama's work.  He's not a man to share credit so he shouldn't be surprised when his contribution is downplayed.
2021-03-10 12:23:09,It's not just a question of the steps Biden took to ramp up production it's also the fact that he and his team got a grip of the logistics. Trump's administration just dumped the problem in the hands of the states which created mass confusion.
2021-03-10 12:23:21,"How many more Americans might be vaccinated and alive today if between the election and the inauguration, the Trump administration had focused its energy on getting vaccines into people arms, rather than obsessing over an election that Trump clearly lost?"
2021-03-10 12:22:37,Not complicated. Trump’s administration successfully started the process and Biden’s has taken over the effort.
2021-03-10 12:11:55,"Trump was implicated in 40% of the false dialogue on the virus, and now without him, we see more proper responses to the virus.

Trump's lies are responsible for much of the death and disability from the virus, from the people that didn't listen to reason, didn't listen to science, and that was worked up to a frenzy by Trump's rhetoric.

Giving credit to Trump, as if the vaccine is and was the sole answer to the problem, ignores Trump's hand in spreading disinformation and distrust. Trump was implicated in 40% of lies spread across the internet.

The only thing Trump should be getting credit for is the deaths he helped cause, for the disability many will live with.

Also, considering the incompetence and corruption of Trump and his team, how much better could the response have been?"
2021-03-10 11:49:08,"Really don't care what Donald Trump did last minute to speed up vaccine production. Sounds like it was his aides anyway who should get more credit than he for speeding up Pfizer production. What Donald Trump DOES get full credit for is the countless deaths throughout the early stages of the pandemic by not immediately telling the American people what was coming our way. He liked to ""play down the virus"" as he told Bob Woodward in a recorded interview on February 7, 2020. Donald Trump gets complete credit for his horrible mishandling of this national disaster pretty much until he left office. Let's just focus on today and all the positives taking place with a new president and leave Trump out of the news."
2021-03-10 12:25:34,"Not sure why anyone would give Trump any credit for matters related to the vaccine when it was well covered at the time and reported, nearly on a daily basis, that he was obstructing the nation's acquisition of the vaccine, so much so that it was sold to other countries after Trump cancelled an order for millions of doses."
2021-03-10 12:25:40,"While the topic of the article is the production of the vaccines , an equally important issue is how to get them in arms and the Trump administration did ZERO for that, forcing states to go it alone. The Biden administration has offered FEMA, The Military and other crucial resources. Sadly the Biden administration has been unable to fix the extremely unequal distribution system that Trump's  let the states decide policy set in motion."
2021-03-10 12:26:29,"I'm not sure what the point of this front page news article is. Donald Trump did not help anyone during this national crisis. He lied repeatedly about the severity of the disease, the massive financial and social impact to our country, and basic common sense safety precautions. 

The hostility Trump threw to our scientific and medical community was breathtaking. Dr Fauci lived under constant death threats! He probably still does because of Trump's conspiracy theories and outright lies.

""With Trump's Help"" Really? Gimme a break. Kudos to scientific and medical staff like Dr Fauci and the countless unnamed people who worked so hard to save our lives."

2021-03-10 12:26:36,"The Trump administration got the vaccines up and running via Operation Warp Speed.  And in remarkable time. State, territorial, and tribal governments have final authority over distribution priorities.  The Biden administration has done nothing more than ride Trump administration the coat tails relative to the vaccine issue.  The vaccine developments are an amazing success, particularly when viewed from the timeline and efficacy perspectives.  Kudos to the Trump administration for creating the gold standard model for government/industry collaboration relative to rapid vaccine development and distribution."
2021-03-10 11:56:16,"President Biden examined the situation, using the help of actual experts, and took the steps necessary to maximize production and efficient distribution. He has never claimed that his Administration has done everything."
2021-03-10 11:51:54,"Trump gets credit for lowering the public discourse to the point where the question of who deserves credit for vaccine distribution is the focus of a lead NY Times article while we’re still in the midst of trying to end a pandemic that is currently killing 1,500+ Americans each day."
2021-03-10 11:27:18,"Complete baloney. No mention of Operation Warp Speed, 10 or more billions of dollars, which Trump set up early in 2020 to rev up the pharmaceutical industry search for a vaccine while the Times and others were predicting a vaccine in no less than 2-3 years down the road. It should be called the Trump Vaccine."
2021-03-10 12:26:39,"Just one question: after he resoundingly lost the election in early November, how much time did Donald Trump personally spend on ANY issue related on the pandemic?
I know he spent a tremendous amount of time, if not all his time, lying about the election he lost, golfing, and suing election officials. During that time, in which he was entirely focused on himself and undermining our country, we suffered through the worst wave of pandemic destruction we experienced this entire year. 
So I would encourage Trump supporters, please by all means give us the proof, the documents that show exactly how Trump spent his time during those crucial months. Show us the meetings he had about the Defense Production Act; the calls to Dr. Fauci; the communications with the vaccine producers. Its all so easily provable (or not)!"
2021-03-10 12:14:51,"Look Trump sat on his hands for over a year, except for tweeting, and Joe Biden got the process going at high speed. It is obvious to anyone with an open mind who deserves the credit."
2021-03-10 12:14:44,"I don't get the point of articles like these.  Why deepen divisions in the country?  Aren't things bad enough?  Who cares about the grumbling of Trump and his minions.  You reported what Trump did while he was in office. Now just report on what Biden is doing.  Let readers come to their own conclusions based on facts, and let history take care of the rest."
2021-03-10 11:57:30,"Click Bait ???

I don’t recall seeing any NYT article, or any other media outlet for that matter, which gave President Obama and Vice President Biden credit for the economic recovery from the Great Recession.  It’s painfully obvious that Trump would never have been able to see this country rebound had it not been for the efforts and successes of the Obama administration which created the solid groundwork which allowed us to continue to rebound.

It so often annoys me to see headlines which desperately rely on pitting one party against the other just to get a click.  I hope to see the day when we are able to see past the partisan mentality and promote a successful American recovery by recognizing and promoting success without desperately seeking a click with a division promoting headline.

To be clear, I know we could have seen much less suffering and death if Trump were not most interested in Trump.  His selfish need for personal recognition did begin the groundwork for a vaccine, however that same demented need for self promotion prevented us from saving lives and preparing to mass produce and distribute the same vaccine.  

President Biden has no reason to give Trump any credit for his continued efforts that have brought companies together to mass produce and distribute the vaccine and his continued drive to aid struggling Americans who are in desperate financial situations which were caused by the neglect of the the Trump administration."
2021-03-10 11:43:36,"The idea that Donald Trump took any substantive action to fashion a viable vaccination program is just an egregious lie. So the premise of this entire journalistic piece is offensive to those of us who take this virus and protocols to combat it seriously. Trump said for us not to worry, that the virus would magically go away. And then we have to pick up the paper and read this? It is truly disheartening."
2021-03-10 11:52:49,Should you give two firefighters joint credit for putting the fire out when one of them poured gasoline on it after arriving on the scene instead of grabbing the hose?

2021-03-10 11:51:32,"I spent eight years in pharma and biotech. Sorry but Trump and Co. mainly deserve a participation trophy. At most.

Yes, they did the obvious, the least they could do, and got pharma to work on the vaccines. Pfizer and Moderna (and many others) did what they do best in their labs and conducting trials. They're heroes. They bulked up---to a point--- for the production process but did not, arguably COULD NOT, scale sufficiently while Trump and his Keystone Kops, dithered. 

Once pharma did its job, Trump dropped the ball. Or, to be accurate, never picked it up.

The failure to scale up and then effectively address mass distribution/mass inoculation was what began to kill Americans. And Trump's refusal to get the Federal government into the role it should have been playing all along was what set the U.S. on a record-breaking mortality rate.

President Biden, and his administration, immediately spotted the gap and moved to address it. The hand-off from pharma to scale-up, distribution and inoculation---the vital link, the government's main job---came under control."
2021-03-10 12:27:11,"That ship has sailed.  Trump will always be evaluated in the context of his overall response.  Trump's management of the crisis will be studied for generations--under the heading of ""what not to do""."

2021-03-10 11:57:14,Did you forget about the lost months between the election and the inauguration? Just think if Trump allowed Biden’s team to collaborate with him in November. Trim off a couple of months from Biden’s current timeline. My goodness. Most Americans would be vaccinated by now. Three months is a long time - cost many lives and livelihoods after a devastating year. What a wildly false equivalence you claim.
2021-03-10 11:36:34,Nowhere in this article does it actually mention what the Trump administration did to apparently earn credit besides an extremely belated order that helped with plastic liners.
2021-03-10 12:28:56,"The credit belongs to no President or political party. It belongs to the scientists and pharmaceutical companies who made this happen. As is often the case the media tells a political story but misses the real heroes. This was a Hugh scientific achievement in record time. Perhaps a story about the scientist, manufacturing teams and regulators at the FDA. The real key was keeping the politicians out of this as much as possible."
2021-03-10 11:34:46,I really didn’t see much in this article to backup the premise this was a 50/50 split on credit for a vaccine rollout. Thin gruel on what exactly Trumps administration did-the praises sung by a Trump sycophant is meaningless and the most accurate description probably came from the Pfizer rep. And did they ever find the unaccounted for 20 million “lost” doses that seemingly “fell off the back of the truck” in the waning days of the Inciter in Chief?

2021-03-10 12:27:22,"Maybe because Trump really doesn’t care whether Americans are vaccinated as long as he got his.

A vaccine is as close to a magic bullet in making Covid go away, unlike injecting bleach.

Truth is, if Trump could have faked a vaccine to successfully win re-election,  he would have.

Biden actually understands that ..... along with being politically useful, a vaccine saves lives..... even in red states."

2021-03-10 12:46:08,"It is fair to say that credit should be spread among many, including the vaccine makers and suppliers, and not just the presidents.

Trump took credit for everything anyone else did. That's all he ever did.  500,000 people in the US have died from the coronavirus, THAT is what Trump deserves credit for.  

There is nothing good that happened between January 2017 and January 2021 that Trump should get credit for,  but plenty of ugly, racist, sexist, xenophobic, ignorant,  treasonous anti-American acts that will follow him for the rest of his worthless life.

Of course the previous administration gets credit for the current status of the vaccine rollout, just as the current administration gets credit for the incremental adjustments it's been able to make in the short span of seven weeks.

The old show of All the Good Things Happening are Owned by the Current Administration and All the Bad Things Happening are Owned by the Previous Administration can be expected to continue its decades long run. Sit back and enjoy the show; just remember not to take it too seriously."
2021-03-10 12:43:44,"Yes, there was some positive contribution of the Trump Administration to the fight against Covid19 - BUT it was as minimal as it could have been without encountering  national uprising. When, and even before, Covid19 struck, legitimate epidemiologists and virologists (spanning several previous ad ministrations) had a combat plan. The Trump administration threw billions at three of the most promising pharmaceutical alliances, letting them do the work. NOTHING MORE was done by Trump despite all of his histrionics and lies about both the seriousness of the pandemic, the non-existent Federal plans or accurate figures. He dropped it all on drug companies and the States. That is NOT administration - that was a spasm.

Biden inherited a dead-end process with no unified plan and no infrastructure, ABANDONED by Trump's incompetence and impotence yet hawked as a great triumph (not). Yes, vaccines, thanks to Pfizer, Moderna and J&J would be produced due to THEIR R&D but it ll stopped there. From scratch, the COMPETENT Biden administration began round-the-clock ""into arms"" distribution and effectively enacted existing, but unused, emergency production. Had it not been for Biden, this entire process would have failed and hundreds of thousands more Americans would have died due to Trump's total incompetence - despite the hyperbole of TrumpTV and Republican distraction and cover-up."
2021-03-10 13:03:40,"Who cares about credit? While Trump did virtually everything possible to downplay the virus and exacerbate its spread, Biden has done the opposite.   There has been very little ego and much leadership, which was sorely lacking in the prior administration.  After more than 530,000 deaths, former Trump officials have lost any right to claim credit."
2021-03-10 13:05:09,"THANK YOU, Ms. LaFranier, for playing fair with the facts.  For four long years, it was almost impossible to find an acknowledgement of success for Trump in the NYT.  But the truth is that while he did plenty of foolish and petty things, he also did some things that headed us in the right direction--at least on the pandemic.

I am reminded of the Hoover administration.  Many of the policy successes of FDR...were actually birthed in the Hoover administration.  The difference?  Hoover was an incredible organizer and planner...but the nation needed more; they needed warmth and reassurance.  FDR gave them that is spades.

Trump did things that, though complained about and decried, will not be undone.  For instance, no president will ever move the embassy away from Jerusalem.  No president was brave enough to move it there...and now none will be brave enough to undo it.

The Abraham Accords brought multiple Arab/Muslim nations to recognize Israel.  If Obama had done that, he would have won the Nobel Peace prize for more than just not being GWB.

A door was opened in North Korea.  No fruit yet, but there is now the real opportunity of seeing each other as something besides a force of darkness.  I dare say that door will be stepped through again.

In any case, THANK YOU for playing fair.  I know that Trump is often (justifiably) detested by others.  At the same time, no one is pure light (except One), and no one is pure darkness (not even Satan...see C.S. Lewis)."
2021-03-10 12:53:03,"I can understand the frustration that people who worked on the vaccine program during the Trump administration are feeling.

The Biden administration inherited a vaccine program largely developed by the Trump administration.  The Trump team, despite their leader, apparently got a lot of things right.  Biden's people tweaked it a bit, pulled a few strings, and got it rolling.  They also criticized the Trump team for their failings, especially when it came to their plans for  distribution.

Unfair? Maybe, but as the old saying goes ""Them's the breaks.""

When Donald Trump came into office he inherited a growing economy from the Obama administration.  He wasted no time in claiming every growth in GDP and every drop in the unemployment rate as due totally and completely to his own efforts and in no way a continuation of trends seen under the previous administration.

Trump isn't the only president to take credit for his predecessor's achievements, he was just, as is his way particularly shameless about it.  You could argue that Trump taking credit for the vaccine development at all when his attitude toward the virus was to downplay and dismiss it is also shameless.  I won't argue.

Now Biden and his team get to take credit for the vaccine rollout when it's finally going well.  Indeed, if the vaccine succeeds in stopping the Coronavirus he will get to claim credit for what we all hope will be the economic recovery that follows.

As I said before ""Them's the breaks."""
2021-03-10 12:42:58,This is rich! Whatever Trump did was purely by accident. He had no plan and could care less about how many people died. Let's not forget that Trump also claimed economic victory off Obama's efforts. Trump inherited a strong economy and tanked it as he did with all his businesses.
2021-03-10 12:49:43,"To be clear, the credit does not belong to either of them. It belongs to the teams of scientists who worked like dogs for six months to create a working mRNA vaccine.z. And it belongs to Katalin Kariko and Drew Weissman, who devote their lives to researching those vaccines."

I’ve had enough of political rhetoric suggesting  that the President of the United States whoever it might be was complicit in not doing his job in one of the most serious emergencies  the world has ever known.  I congratulate both Trump and Biden but I definitely do not congratulate Biden for his comment leading up to the election that Trump killed 200,000 Americans. This is a good example of why people are fed up with political rhetoric."
2021-03-10 12:55:35,"To Trump administration aides, the new president’s crowing rings off-key. Mr. Biden is proclaiming victory off his predecessor’s achievements while wrongly grumbling about a mess he says he inherited, they say.

Anyone from Trump's administration tempted to crow over its effort to deal with COVID 19 needs to remember that almost a half a million people died on their watch while their boss was mostly golfing and tweeting, and telling people, for instance, household cleaning products, taken internally, could be the answer. If he and those around him could have done a worse job, this reader is at a loss to imagine how."
2021-03-10 12:54:37,"In late November 2020, Mr Trump and his administration promised 20 million vaccine administered by December 31, 2020.   In reality, a little over 2 million shots were administered when his term ended on January 20, 2021.   

If the former President wasn’t consumed with trying to overturn an election and supporting (at best) an insurrection at the U.S. Capital which resulted in 5 deaths, untold countless trauma and over 500 million in tax payer money needed for cleanup, restoration and security, then perhaps he could have been consumed with protecting his fellow American citizens by administering all 20 million doses by January 20, 2021.   

Numbers don’t lie: 400,000   Americans dead and 2 million vaccine shots administered on Mr. Trumps last day in office.    This is his “I alone can fix it” record."
2021-03-10 12:39:08,"Funny but the former president virtually abandoned any ""playbook"" from the election day until the inauguration.  They did not monitor the vaccine roll out in any remotely effective way.

Most people didn't believe and some ridiculed when Trump said in May last year that the vaccine would be available by the end of 2020.  I didn't believe that would be possible either.
2021-03-10 12:57:50,"For past few months pharma execs have been gloating over how pandemic helped boost the public sentiment about them - driving approval from low 30% in 2019 to 60+% in 2020. That should come handy if more oversight regulations are introduced, or Wellstone Amendment comes back. News coverage framed in opaque terms obviously helps selling pharma new image (and not just changing logos - here's looking at you, Pfizer). In more specific terms Johnson and Johnson didn't ""forge an alliance"" with Merck, nor did Merck agreed to ""help"" to make JNJ vaccine. Biden administration gifted Merck 269 million $ to upgrade its 2 plants so they'd be used to boost Johnson and Johnson vaccine production, for which Merck will also get a part of profits. For Merck who killed 2 Covid-19 vaccine programs of its own, this is a way to get in on the racket and use taxpayers money to upgrade its plants. All of this framed in terms of ""help"" and ""alliances"" only obscures the transactional nature of this whole business and vast sums of money we the taxpayers put in to grease the wheels."
2021-03-10 12:28:12,"Is this some kind of attempt at ""fair and balanced"" reporting.  
Trump threw distribution and getting shots into people's arms to the states.  Biden got the federal government involved.  Trump maintained the virus was a hoax until the very end.  Consequently we have at least 20% who still believe that lie.  Trump did authorize some development funds but not all companies took it.  
Not using the defense production act was a huge Trump mistake.  Biden's doing so unleashed production.  That's a really big deal.

The entire process is a logistical nightmare that can only be pulled  off through federal management.  That's what the Biden administration is doing, managing it.  That's exactly what Trump did not do.  The new relief act will greatly assist that effort.

And if you want to assign credit, that goes to the people of of the vaccine companies who worked their tails off to create and produce these wonders of medicine and the people on the front lines injecting the vaccines it into peoples arms, and the transportation workers who are putting in long, hard hours to get the life saving medicine delivered.  Trump just signed a spending authorization and attacked his medical experts for telling the public the truth."

Credit should go to Operation Warp Speed, which is the epidemiological equivalent of World War II’s Manhattan Project, and to the the manufacturers who found ways speed production. To suggest this was possible due to Biden’s “carefully calculated goals” is laughable. The manufacturers are doing what manufacturers always do; they are increasing production to meet demand. They will continue to increase production until demand began to fall. Once the U.S. market is saturated, Biden will announce a goal of supplying of doses to other countries, but this is something the manufacturers also would do regardless of what Biden announces."

2021-03-10 13:06:05,"There is no explanation why vaccine production has been so slow.  Imagine if this virus killed 30% of people who got infected and specifically targeted people 15 to 40 years old, would this roll out of vaccine have been acceptable?  No.  People respond to me by saying, vaccine production is complex and can't be set up in a day but we knew the formula for these vaccines in April of 2020.  Every resource of the pharmaceutical companies should have been focused on building manufacturing capacity.  If we needed additional facilitates for production, they should have been built starting in May of 2020 and work should have been going on 24 hours a day.  Wasn't that what Operation Warp Speed was supposed to be?  Trump and the American people offered the pharmaceutical companies unlimited money to get this done and they dragged their feet.  There should be an investigation."

The people who developed the vaccine had been researching and perfecting mRNA techniques for 10 years easily - long hard work. The coincidence of COVID and this research was serendipitous and became the right fit much to the delight of researchers - not from the efforts of politicians, not of a political party, or some grand plan to save the world from the epidemic. It was science and perseverance and knowledge. The manufacture and distribution is another matter; the failure of one administration and the practicality and commitment of another.

Trump is responsible for his super spreader events that contributed to over half a million deaths.  No other country comes close to the American mortality rate.

2021-03-10 12:53:19,"If I remember correctly, the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines were approved for emergency use on first responders just after Thanksgiving. As much as I hate lying, President Trump can be forgiven for saying ""the end is in sight"" and that he'd have vaccines ""by Election Day"". It's splitting hairs to argue over three or four weeks. Nevertheless, the vaccine rollout has clearly benefited from the perception of greater competence associated with the Biden administration as well as a handful of savvier actions, notably prevailing upon the vial manufacturer to go 24/7. That the Trumps didn't think to ask that is the difference between an experienced politician and his seasoned staff and a novice from television with a staff chosen for its willingness to flatter their boss. We'll know better from now on--won't we?"
2021-03-10 12:38:58,"History will always wonder just what it was about the coronavirus that confounded Trump. The virus began in another country, there was plenty of time to prepare for it, yet when it came the country was totally unprepared. Other countries quickly shutdown all inward travel, the US did it in slow motion. From the beginning Trump downplayed it, even though he was told early how dangerous it could be. When it landed on New York’s doorstep , he seemed uninterested. It was as though New York was totally on its own. The Mayor of NYC was literally begging Trump for test kits, and the right to conduct tests on their own. Where hours mattered the Trump administration waited days to give answers. 

The scorecard is clear. History is fond of statistics, and the numbers are stark. As of this writing 527,000 Americans have died due to coronavirus, compare that with Japan-8,359 dead, or Canada-22,304 dead. The fact is that the majority of countries on earth did very well containing a virus that can be slowed with just a few proactive steps like, enforcing mask wearing and quarantining for two weeks everyone who enters the country.

The countries that did best against coronavirus are the countries with a strong leadership and a United people who rose to meet the challenge of their lives.

Unfortunately the US failed in both categories and the numbers speak for themselves."
2021-03-10 13:03:34,"To be more precise with some of the facts, the government contracts that the Army awarded most of the vaccines production under were established under the Obama/Biden Administration in 2015/2016 timeframe prior to Trump being in office. They were then modified to purchase these specific vaccine efforts. This illustrates how important the continuity of effective government is regardless of party. Without the ground work laid by Obama, Trumps response likely would have had some delays associated with the establishment of new contracts."
2021-03-10 13:04:35,"Trump deserves little, if any, credit. It’s a no brainer to support rapid vaccine development during a pandemic. And that’s exactly what governments across Asia and Europe did in 2020.  Trump had little to no plan to distribute vaccines and provided no money to states to implement vaccine programs. And he everything he could to undermine preventative  measures to curb the spread of the virus, making the pandemic worse and taking more lives that necessary. 

My thanks and praise go mainly to scientists and pharmaceutical companies, several of which launched vaccines. Trump supported the Moderna vaccine and had nothing to do at all the other vaccines on the market across the globe."
2021-03-10 13:31:32,"If variants continue to proliferate in the developing world rendering the vaccines minimally effective or completely ineffective, both Presidents will be remembered for not having the insight and courage to invalidate the patents so that all companies with the expertise and equipment would be able to ramp up production of the vaccine.

Public health and safety are far more important than profits. Both presidents evidently disagree with that statement, so far."
2021-03-10 13:46:32,"That’s great that the two administrations are battling over who takes credit for what, but why am I still searching for a vaccine appointment every day and not able to find a slot? While I drum my fingers on the table and wait for the countdown to enter the online appointment waiting rooms, only to be told that all slots are full, I guess I’d have to say that Trump messed everything up as much as possible, and Biden is doing as much as he can to rectify the situation, but it’s far from ideal, partially because once again, technology is seen as the answer to everything, not just another tool in the toolkit. I’d love to speak to a live person over the phone and get on a waiting list."
2021-03-10 13:54:59,"I'm in my eighties, I suffer from COPD and I still can't get a vaccine appointment close to where I live in Columbus, Ohio because all appointments are taken. I can make an appointment to get the vaccine in about a week and a half if I sit in my car on a waiting line a distance from where I live which doesn't work for me."
2021-03-10 14:00:26,"Yes, we know. Both sides are bad because the corporations fear the left. So, no matter how bad the republicans are they receive corporate cover in the form of the ""Democrats are bad too"". 

Technically, the vaccine was rolled out in record time not because of the democrats or the republicans or by corporations, but by some very smart vaccine creators who may have connections to both government and corporations, but are individually responsible for holding the knowledge that allowed the vaccine to be so quickly developed.  

The best we can say about government and corporations is that they didn't interfere too much this time. Mostly because it was in the interest of profits for corporate America. Had they seen a more profitable path, they may have done differently.

It is quite a bit of a leap to believe that if the ""Trump Administration"" helped  in the vaccine roll out that Trump actually had anything to do with it.  It is also a bit of a stretch to think that his flunkies helped much either. It is undoubtedly more due to the career civil servants who know what to do and likely worked for both administrations."
2021-03-10 12:32:50,"Hard to feel sorry for the Trump administration, given how eager they were to claim credit for economic trends that were already in place since the Obama administration."
2021-03-10 12:29:02,"The article doesn't read as if Trump helped other than shoving pharmaceutical cos. to rush to develop a vaccine so that he could use that for his re-election campaign. Remember, he bad-mouthed pharmas, wouldn't work with them, and then set up an allotment system that favored his states over blue states. Worse, by rushing a RNA synthesis vaccine that had to immediately destroy DNA templates to prevent RNA mutations, we have vaccines -- PFE and Moderna -- that will require a 3rd booster. We've had no broad=scale phase III clinical trial with a CL of 95% for each group and sub-group. Side-effects did not show up until the population at large was being inoculated.  Biden and his group are working at a host of problems."
2021-03-10 13:08:53,"I’ll give that to Biden. He’s done much more. For instance, he chose to be publicly vaccinated to encourage vaccination, while the other guy apparently got vaccinated in secret, or took off his mask in public etc. Didn’t seem the other guy was really trying to help. And he seemed to be spending more time playing golf."
2021-03-10 13:51:21,"No Republican can say this article is unfair. (But, of course, they will.) In fact, I agree with many of the other posters that the headline don't match the facts in the article, and some of the statements about Individual 1's achievements are misleading.

Case in point: ""At the same time, though, Mr. Biden benefited hugely from the waves of vaccine production that the Trump administration had set in motion.""

But then: ""Pfizer officials privately suggested that the Trump administration not only was wrongfully bad-mouthing the company but also had refused for months to invoke the Defense Production Act."""
2021-03-10 13:26:27,Hardcore anti-trumper but compared to the rest of the world we are way ahead of the curve for vaccines which is much related to the trump administration's warp speed. Biden should give credit to the Trump administration for getting the vaccine ready. When he was in office >20 million doses were already distributed which was less than a year from the first covid case..
2021-03-10 13:45:45,"In the game of politics timing is everything. And Trump DID play politics with the virus, pretending it wasn't there to win the Election while supporting vaccine scale-up in the background. How many American lives did it cost? How perverse was that?
 Sentiments aside, if Biden takes advantage of the scale-up now, imagine how Trump would if he could."
2021-03-10 13:01:05,"I'm waiting to give credit to whomever succeeds in vaccinating 70 percent of the world, so that this terrible pandemic can truly be declared over.  The United States is not enough."
2021-03-10 13:44:07,One is left wondering how much more work could have been done toward organizing production and distribution of the vaccine had Trump not spent the last 2 1/2 months of his term solely focused on perpetuating a stupendous lie.
2021-03-10 13:33:32,There was not much trump could do.  And he didn't.
2021-03-10 13:13:41,"“They criticize what we did, but they are using our playbook every step of the way,” said Paul Mango, the Trump administration’s deputy chief of staff for health policy. 
The Biden team is “maintaining a very nice trajectory,” Mr. Mango said. “But don’t criticize us to make yourselves look better.”

Is he really clueless about doing what he complains about was the Trump playbook with every single policy and act?  At least Biden hasn't tweeted about it incessantly or come up with an insulting nickname for Mango's former boss."
2021-03-10 13:27:49,"This headline is a joke. But fine, I’ll play. 

You want to give Trump credit?  Give him credit for:

1.  Downplaying the severity of the pandemic and lying to the public from the start
2.  Refusing by to listen to public health officials or to implement infection controls
3.  Starting and fueling the anti-mask craze
4.  Starting and fueling the anti-Asian sentiment
5.  Starting and fueling the anti-lockdown craze
6.  Delaying much needed federal assistance to individuals, cities and states (so he could put his name on the checks, to make democrats look bad)
7.  Presiding over and exacerbating PPE shortages 
8.  Putting incompetent and unproven people like Jared and his frat brothers in charge
9.  Hosting massive super-spreader events directly tied to thousands of deaths 
10.  Gutting and dismantling pivotal public health institutions, including those for pandemic preparedness 
11.  Gutting and dismantling Obamacare just when it’s needed the most 
12.  Declining to reserve hundreds of millions of much needed vaccine doses when they were offered because of pettiness (Pfizer refused to work with Trump’s Warp Speed)
13.  Botching the vaccine rollout despite having 10 months to prepare for it
14.  Undermining confidence in the FDA by forcing approval of unproven medications
15.  Presiding over the single, largest loss of human life and economic collapse in our nation’s history

Oh - and he bought a few ventilators and gave a bit of money for others to do research."
2021-03-10 13:23:35,"I think Trumps contribution can be best summed up with a single quote from him on 3/10/20 exactly 1 year ago.  ""Just stay calm. It will go away.”"
2021-03-10 13:22:39,"Trump would not have been involved with vaccine production if 2020 wasn’t an election year. Was there any day during his time in office when he didn’t act like a complete sociopath? 500,000 people died on Trump’s watch, all while he refused to wear a mask and encouraged others not to wear masks. He gets credit for death."
2021-03-10 13:43:28,"Trump deserves credit? Seriously? Okay, let's give him credit for 400,000 deaths before he left office. 

And as for Biden's posturing or caution, the first rule of good leadership is to manage expectations. Under promise and overdeliver.  Deftly handled, Mr. President."
2021-03-10 13:36:28,"As usual, Trump cares only about optics and not about governance."
2021-03-10 13:18:16,"Just imagine how much better off we as a nation would be if “the former guy” had actually taken his job seriously and taken the steps that President Biden is taking. The former guy doesn’t even deserve to be mentioned in the same headline, let alone being compared with Biden. Give us a break."
2021-03-10 13:41:29,Using a sports analogy: This would be like Brad Sellers taking credit for Michael Jordan hiring The Shot against the Cleveland Cavs in 1989 because he passed him the ball.
2021-03-10 13:13:00,"If Trump had been doing his job the vaccine roll out they now want to take credit for wouldn’t have been as critically important. Lying to the people and claiming the virus was nothing to worry about, cost many thousands of lives.  Then down playing the use of masks and social distancing cost us many thousands more.  Trump should be rewarded as the Reaper of Death, not vaccines."
2021-03-10 13:23:40,"The first vaccine was introduced in early December and the Trump White House promised that 20 million people would be vaccinated by year's end.  Less than 2.2 million were.

Instead of rallying that rollout effort and working like a Swiss watchmaker (or even any McDonald's off the highway) with states for effective rollout, Trump and his entire administration were 100% buried in his Election Fraud Myth and Legal assaults that ended with people getting murdered at our nation's Capitol.

That was just one aspect of his many failures to prevent the needless deaths of hundreds of thousands of Americans.  Trump had already set in motion the pandemic's horrible toll the first time he downplayed what the CIA, the CDC and W.H.O. had warned him was a ""monster"" about to be unleashed on this country and the world."
2021-03-10 13:43:46,"Trump deserves the vast majority of the credit for the vaccines, both for their existence and their distribution. Operation Warp Speed. Biden has surely continued on the path set by his predecessor, and done an acceptable job, but it's only here at the New Woke Times info bubble that a president who hasn't even been in office long enough to hold a press conference would deserve any credit for the development and distribution of the Covid vaccinations."
2021-03-10 13:47:02,"There were always two parts to the solution - (1) a vaccine and (2) a vaccination program.  You cannot have one without the other.

The previous adminstration got the vaccine part going (albeit with not much thought/effort on how to administer it) and the current administration got the vaccination program going.  (IMO - the program still has some hiccups, given that each state is controlling it)

Maybe each adminstration could just shake each others hands and congratulate each other?

Nah......makes too much sense."
2021-03-10 13:39:28,"I'm an RN and started a job at Hospice in the middle of January of last year. I was getting bombarded with emails from my new job. I read them all, but didn't delete them, since I wasn't sure which ones pertained to me. Now I recognize which ones are important, and delete them as soon as I see them. I finally went back and looked at the earlier ones to delete them, and came across one dated February 1st from our medical director in response to COVID 19. It advised ALL of the things that we are doing now and went into detail about social distancing, wearing masks, quarantining vs isolation, disinfecting your home, etc...  February 1st! When did Trump take it seriously? The end of March! AND, he continued to scoff at social distancing and mask wearing! He has blood on his hands!"
2021-03-10 13:15:08,"This could have happened under the former guy'sAdministration if he didn't deny, deny, deny that there was a deadly virus spreading in the first place.  He spent months trying to coverup this very fact.  Then he insists that masking is not necessary, try  drinking bleach, etc. It was a Democratic hoax according to him.  
The""former  guy"" is clearly responsible for 500,000 deaths and counting by his lack of caring. and complete disregard for the safety of the citizens 
And even worse, he and his wife sneakily get a vaccine?  That says it all

I will give him credit for signing onto Project Warp Speed, but this should have been done in the beginning."
2021-03-10 13:25:32,"Let’s not forget the fact that Trump and company refused to coordinate with the incoming administration after the election over just about everything. The fact that President Biden and his team got to work the day after the election while Trump golfed and vacationed in Florida says it all for me. This is Biden’s win, plain and simple."
2021-03-10 13:08:27,"The Times was courageous with that headline.  Its nice to see some transcendence of politics.  I will reconsider by subscription boycott.  However, that does not diminish the fact that Trump was a disaster in his handling of the information campaign regarding this pandemic.   Thanks for a little balance for a change"
2021-03-10 13:51:11,"The situation in Portland is far from ideal but I have an appointment for my first shot today, and I seriously doubt that would be happening under a second Trump administration. Biden is doing great and deserves credit, not that credit is the issue. Shots in arms..."
2021-03-10 13:35:34,"Trump, Trump, Trump! Enough Trump already. Trump is/was responsible for the deaths of tens  (or hundreds) of thousands of Americans because of his inability to treat the Covid pandemic as a national crisis instead of a public relations problem for Donald Trump. His administration was a disaster. It is true that during his administration several vaccines were developed that are now on track to make Covid19 a bad memory. But, how much of the vaccine development was due to Trump and how much to the medical research institutions, both private and governmental that had been established long before Trump decided that he wanted to be President? 

  No Trump was neve truly the ""President of the United States"" he was simply someone who played ""The ""President"" on TV. Can anyone cite any executive 
accomplishment that Trump achieved that made America a better country for all Americans? Signing executive orders and issuing adolescent Tweets are not what makes someone a competent president."
2021-03-10 13:24:41,"To paraphrase Truman: It's amazing what you can accomplish if no one cares who gets the credit.

Drumpf claims to have set the groundwork for the vaccine success. 

I don't care.

I care that he lied about the virus, delayed putting our military industrial complex to work making PPE, ventilators, masks, you name it, pointed fingers at states and told them to ""heal thyself"" while he got first-rate treatment and the vaccine, along with having a lying doctor to obfuscate about his situation. 

If he had acted like a leader and not like a carnival barker, this would have run a far different course."
2021-03-10 13:25:49,"Trump led an insurrection against the United States, whatever his role, or should we venture to guess, the role his position of office had in securing anything, is absolutely no longer valid."
2021-03-10 13:49:03,"Seems when Democrats blame previous Republican Administrations for something or don't give them credit for something it is base on mostly on the truth and the facts.

Seems when Republicans blame previous Democratic Administrations for something or don't give them credit for something it is based mostly on lies and few facts.

A good example is Republicans blamed Obama for the worst financial disaster in our history which they handed him.  Republicans blamed Obama for the worst economy in the world when Obama handed Trump an economy that had rounded third and headed home.  

Big difference in the two parties."
2021-03-10 13:11:21,"If you give the credit to Biden, you are ignoring the actual facts.  Trump did all the right things except set a good example.  By not setting the right example, he helped kill a very large number of people.  But give Trump credit, grudgingly, for getting this going."
2021-03-10 13:23:16,Why is it so hard to give Trump credit for this?  Operation Warp Speed was a huge success.  There.
2021-03-10 13:51:07,"We all know Trump himself paid no attention whatsoever to the Pandemic other than to watch the economy and stock market. Pfizer was not part of his surge, but has worked relentlessly with Biden. Biden has made it clear he is in charge while Trump delegated to a number of people in succession depending upon who was in his good graces."
2021-03-10 13:42:54,"Sorry, but the Trump administration only gets credit for botching the response, leading to the deaths of 525,000 Americans and counting. 

Trump narcissistic desire to be the center of attention, to deliver senseless messages, to mock scientists, to give rosy predictions (gone by Easter), and to embrace conspiracy theorists broke this nation. 

NOTHING Trump did aided the vaccine effort. He was bullied into supporting Operation Warp Speed by scientists outside of his political influence and by Democrats who proposed funding it. 

To give Trump credit for belatedly approving some minor ramping up of production and streamlining of distribution once his political power had been all but stripped after January 6 is to ignore that he was a puppet of his inner circle by then. While he obsessively watched FOX and OAN, others of his enablers were finally able to make very slight progress. 

To give Trump credit for the vaccine supply and delivery increase is like giving Rev. Jim Jones credit for those who survived Jonestown."
2021-03-10 13:28:01,"If Trump were re-elected, the vaccine  would be named after him and he would get a percentage of the profits.  That is how Trump's mind works."
2021-03-10 13:22:27,"Well, Trump claimed credit for the economic growth that began during the Obama administration....

He should really take credit for the lack of planning for distributing the vaccines. A competent president would have dedicated resources to create a supply chain management system for the vaccines. Each state or county could define eligibility criteria for different phases of distribution.

Instead, it’s necessary to visit multiple websites for pharmacies, hospitals, and state and county agencies, only to learn that no appointments are available. “Check back later.”"
2021-03-10 13:21:54,"When will the scientists, labs, and manufacturers be given credit?"
2021-03-10 13:44:55,"According to himself, Trump was responsible for Obama's economic turn-around.  We know where credit is due and where it isn't."
2021-03-10 13:17:32,"Sharing credit for ramping up production, which is the main factor now, is fine but it probably has little to do with either of them.

More importantly, the former ""president"" gets full credit for mismanagement (and consistently setting a terrible example) of the crisis, which was either full incompetent or actually designed to do damage. After all, destruction has seemed to be one of his hobbies.

Had he taken the simple and rational steps to minimize the damage (ie, let experts recommend and run the response), he would probably/unfortunately still be president."
2021-03-10 13:22:57,"Donald Trump may have signed off on the funding for Operation Warp Speed, but the development of the vaccines was a triumph of the scientists, physicians and pharmaceutical companies who developed them.  Trump also set the program back when he fired Dr. Rick Bright, the head of Department of Health and Human Services’ Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, who was deeply involved in guiding the effort.  Bright's ""crime""?  He refused to push Hydroxychloroquine, Trump favorite quack ""cure"", which was dangerous and did nothing to treat COVID-19.

A full analysis of Trump's impact on the pandemic also needs to highlight the facts that he minimized the risks and actively opposed essential public health measures, like wearing masks.  Spending money on Operation Warp Speed doesn't undo the fact that hundreds of thousands of Americans are dead or are suffering long term (possibly lifetime) disabilities because Trump massively mishandled the pandemic."
2021-03-10 13:40:23,"The article, especially the headline, suggests Trump and Biden have been equally responsible for vaccine rollout success.  However, Lafraniere fails to mention the fact that the Trump administration did nothing to guide states in the Herculean task of administering vaccine.  As with Covid testing, they left each state to its own devices, without federal support, so the Trump administration could point fingers and avoid blame when some states (especially blue states) faltered in their efforts. Trump never advocated for more financial help to states for vaccine distribution - in fact, Trump had little or no input into the last Cares package; he was too obsessed with his own grievances even as the country struggled to survive a pandemic.  Biden and the Democrats are on the cusp of passing landmark legislation that will provide states with the support they need to ramp up vaccine distribution and open schools. Trump himself never even publicly endorsed taking the vaccine for fear he would alienate some of his base, and even kept his own vaccination a ""secret"" when it occurred in January."
2021-03-10 13:23:28,Really? was it Trump’s efforts or the work or government institutions set up to deal with these problems.   The very institutions that have been torn apart and derided as the “deep state” by the Trump administration.
2021-03-10 13:39:39,"The problem with Trump and vaccines was not so much a matter of production, but of his denial of the power of the virus itself.  As a result millions deny the need for masks or even taking the vaccine.   And people such as Dr. Fauci had to watch what they said around around the president as they lost credibility with the public.  Biden gave us a consistent policy and a will to achieve it, but still we live with Trump's aftermath of denial and obfuscations."
2021-03-10 13:08:58,"Ultimately the American taxpayers collectively, should be give credit. The politicians only acted as our agents, some more effectively than others."
2021-03-10 13:21:29,"It doesn't really matter which admin did what. The states botched this badly. All those months they had to set up registration websites that functioned properly and that could allow everyone to register and check their status in line. They could and should have asked everyone to register, statewide, with age (verified by ID or other manner). The system would then have automatically sent appointment notices to those in the open tiers. It should have allowed registrants to sign up for last-minute notice (end-of-day) doses. All providers should have been in the one single statewide system. Instead, we have a half dozen private providers, county systems, state systems, and the end-of-day mad rush system. It's been a total cluster here in MD and that is on our state government (currently Republican) and not the feds."
2021-03-10 13:17:39,"If they can prove Trump gave credit to Obama for his work on the economy, I will listen to their argument. Until then, I'm not interested."
2021-03-10 13:33:11,"Having read the article multiple times now, the analogy feels akin to a pitcher giving up 10 runs, then a relief pitcher coming in to stabilize the situation.
I guess that pitcher laid the groundwork, but it's a building holding 500k souls."

2021-03-10 13:40:01,"I really do not think Trump himself had much to do with it but there were some, not many, people in his Administration that took the pandemic seriously.  Good for them but again, Trump had nothing to do with it.  When will people realize that Trump only cared about himself and money?  Anyway, President Biden has been personally involved since day one.  It is about time we have a federal government that is in tune with the needs of the people. Bottom line, I would not even hint that Trump cared at all."
2021-03-10 13:33:41,"Who cares. We need a break from everything being political. We elect and pay someone to do this. They did it. Why do we need to give the president credit for everything that happens? Yes the leader is important, but hundreds of people are necessary to carry out these deeds. I will say that Biden at least sees the presidency as a job. Trump saw it as a mirror. A spotlight in a theater."
2021-03-10 13:26:41,"And may we please remember that The Former Guy took credit for a recovering economy that President Obama help haul out of a recession with almost no support from the GOP? 

If only they/he pounced on the emerging threat to our health and welfare with the rapidity of the corporate tax cut. He knew about the virus’ deadliness early on, but led his throng to believe that, like a miracle, it will disappear."
2021-03-10 13:41:53,"Perhaps it makes the best sense to stop obsessing over who gets the credit and to concentrate instead on getting the job done. 

President Biden must be credited with the challenging task of marshalling federal resources in order to roll out a program of manufacture and mass inoculation. in other words, doing the gritty work of governance.

Meanwhile, several Red State governors are doing all in their power to undermine this work."
2021-03-10 13:15:58,"What part of ""hard work in the trenches"" would the Trump administration have difficulty understanding. I think we can all agree that if Trump was still President, we would be lucky if all health care workers had the vaccine. We forget too easily, that for Trump, the concept of implementation was lost on this man."
2021-03-10 13:46:59,"On balance, Trump gets no credit:

- he denies the science that produced the vaccines. 
- he actively discouraged reasonable, accessible and proven effective public health measures, and in doing so he ended up costing hundreds of thousands of lives."
2021-03-10 13:12:40,"The former guy also downplayed the severity of this pandemic but ignoring warnings that tossing aside mask wearing, distancing and limiting business activity would be a help.  So I agree that he gets little credit."
2021-03-10 14:02:34,"The trouble with vaccine distribution is : too much technology, too many agencies with no central coordinator or strategy. I know folks who are much younger but have vaccine appointments because they know someone, know how to use computers and bots or have better insurance/medical providers. We preferred to not invest in Government supported healthcare so we don't have one and we are all at the mercy of private players."
2021-03-10 14:05:17,"And now, what about the Next One? The next step for the Biden administration and the states is to tackle the question of the logistics of handling mass distribution of a vaccine (or any medication for that matter: the Next One could involve an antibiotic or some other treatment regimen.)

We can point fingers forever, or we can use the institutional experience and data amassed department-by-department and state by state to start laying out templates and best practices for future pandemics. What roles should the CDC and FEMA play? What are state governments able to do? How are hospital systems, pharmacies, even airports involved? Smart people in these agencies will need resources to gather all the lessons learned and develop robust, maintainable processes for preparedness. Let's get to work!"
2021-03-10 14:06:13,"Although one can grouse about all the chaos, indecision, dismissive attitudes and failures in relation to the Covid-19 pandemic by the Trump administration, one must be fair and at least give credit to Trump for fast-tracking R&D protocols which resulted in unprecedented breakthroughs in vaccine technology and research. That we now have three vaccines to combat the coronavirus is extraordinary. Regardless, the Biden administration picked up where Trump left off and is competently managing production and distribution of the vaccines nationwide, something which, unfortunately, would not have happened under Trump."
2021-03-10 14:11:45,"Prudent messaging coupled with aggressive internal efforts to exceed stated goals is established public health strategy. And, as Trump rejected public health professionals, and the strategies underlying effective public health communication, from Day One of the pandemic, it is no surprise that Biden is going to both be, and SEEM to be, more successful."
2021-03-10 14:12:59,"I don't recall any diligent, planned, organized and well articulated program during the last administration to develop and distribute the vaccine. I recall Mr Trump taking full credit for the vaccine development. I also recall the both reading and hearing from the researchers and pharmaceutical companies who created and manufactured the vaccines, that they did this on their own without Trump's help. Whatever Federal help was given, it  came late, principally in the form of contracts to buy the vaccine.  It's rather unusual to dismiss a health hazard and then claim credit for curing it. Only a Republican could do this and believe themselves."
2021-03-10 14:09:53,"Let’s face it, under trump we were operating with a wing and a prayer.  His response to Covid was just another example of how he never lived up to the office."
2021-03-10 14:16:50,"If Donald Trump was so proud of his vaccine accomplishments, why did he and Melania get vaccinated secretly in January?  Making a big, public display of getting vaccinated might have been the best way to ramp up the effort nationwide--by signaling to his supporters to get on board.  

If he had been more open and truthful (throughout his presidency), then he could have claimed more credit for his accomplishments."
2021-03-10 13:58:53,"Giving Trump any credit for anything he did during his 4 years, besides the damage he has done to our democracy is like giving Al Capone credit for giving away turkeys for Thanksgiving during the Depression."
2021-03-10 14:14:54,"Why give credit to Trump for fixing a problem that he created? 

If he had done anything but lie about COVID, we wouldn't be in the historic mess we are in. And, although Trump will never admit it to himself, if he hadn't lied about COVID, there is a good chance he would still be President."

2021-03-10 14:05:01,"Administrations don't start and stop on election day. Each President has a slight or great hand in what the next or previous created. Trump had one trait, though I disagreed with much of what he did, but one trait that makes him appealing. He followed through on promises to his base, though true at the detriment of half the country. Is that what it takes I wonder? 
Biden has already reneged on several promises and his rollback of  a Trump edict to correct Obama's anti male bias on college campuses is particularly disappointing. Once again, any woman regardless of pattern of making false claims can point at any young man and say she was assaulted and he will immediately be removed from the school for as long as it takes to investigate, often years. If her claims are found to be false, let bygones be bygones is their solution. 
A new Trump is watching and listening carefully. The left of which I am a part of never learns."
2021-03-10 14:09:58,We wouldn't have been so desperate for the vaccine had trump jumped on this and done the right things from day one. So NO he gets zero credit.
2021-03-10 13:54:51,"I understand the Trump administration, with the development of vaccines, deserves some credit.  When President Biden took office, vaccines already existed.

I also understand that President Trump back in February 2020 and later, ignored how serious Covid_19 was and his inactions caused a delay in acting.

When Trump got in front of the podium and ""informed"" the nation about the pandemic, I remember how down trodden Dr. Anthony Fauci looked. Dr. Robert Redfield, then head of the CDC, looked pained and Dr. Deborah Birx was intimidated into submission.

Compare that with today.  Dr. Anthony Fauci has a smile on his face.  He speaks to the public without a muzzle.  He talks with confidence and is at ease.  I think of Dr. Rochelle Walensky, the current head of the CDC, who speaks almost daily on the news and president Biden is no where in sight. 

Why point this out?

I believe President Biden is involved in making decisions in the pandemic response but I also believe he listens to the experts and has given them the freedom to do what they have prepared to do their entire professional lives.

I cannot imagine the frustration they had a year ago when President Trump prevented them from doing what they had prepared to do for so long.  They were prepared to deal with a pandemic and when one finally came along, they could not do what they needed to do.

I am thankful that President Biden is now leading us."
2021-03-10 13:58:29,"The majority of deaths are Trump's responsibility after he surrendered in the Coronavirus War over a year ago. 

Trump saw bleach as being as or more effective than a vaccine, so no real credit there. 

Don't ""both sides this,"" please."
2021-03-10 14:00:43,"The efforts of the Trump administration to get COVID vaccination program started were fine, but Trump's own selfish refusal to accept federal responsibility for formulating guidelines, and his dithering over masking, cost thousands of Americans their lives.
No contest -- the Biden/Harris administration deserves the grateful thanks of the nation."
2021-03-10 14:04:11,"Trump's people and his political party might demand credit for some part of the vaccine success story, but this aspect absolutely does NOT absolve the Trump administration for the criminal negligence and horrific death tolls that resulted from the endless lies about the lack of danger of the virus, and from the practicing deadly ""herd immunity"" long before the vaccines became available."
2021-03-10 14:16:27,"The absence of a genuine presidential transition by the trump administration to the incoming Biden administration also had to be overcome by the new administration.  From January 6 to vaccinations, and everything in between, Mr. trump was attempting to cause nationwide failure and chaos."
2021-03-10 14:11:59,"When the trump administration acknowledges that its inherited a rising economy based on work done by the Obama-Biden administration, maybe the current administration will acknowledge the work of the Trump team.  But how to you balance the vaccine work with the Trump administration’s failure of basic public health guidelines?  If Trump wants the kudos for the vaccine then he must also own the thousands of lives lost due to his chaotic management of the virus"
2021-03-10 14:17:08,"Why did I click into this article?  Because I wanted to see what was being said about this after seeing my Facebook feed suddenly light up with t supporters who had been noticeably absent until Biden took office. Cue the criticisms of every little thing Biden says or does. Petty little things. And yes, they’re all about giving t credit for the vaccines. These are educated suburban people too.  We still have a long way to go."
2021-03-10 14:04:58,"With the vaccine, Trump did the only thing he knows how to do; spend money.  The dollars were of course necessary and got the ball rolling.  Unfortunately, spending money is not a project plan.

The distribution plan for the product to the point of sale was non-existent.  

How could the states even create a plan without knowing the details for what, where, when and how much vaccine they would be receiving?

And that is why Trump's portion of the project was a failure.

Trump is a ""businessman"".  What business would have survived such colossal failure of leadership who lacked a  plan for distributing their goods?  Any such company would be been bankrupted in short order.

Biden has a project plan that is resolving these issues.  

That is why Biden deserves the credit."
2021-03-10 14:09:41,"Sometimes life isn't totally fair. I'd be be more inclined to offer more credit to the Trump administration for the development of the vaccines if they had behaved like adults and taken the responsibility that was theirs for letting the virus get so out of control in this country in the first place (or, better yet, done more to slow it down)."
2021-03-10 14:17:57,"Trump did the minimum for vaccine development and production.  Any of our previous presidents would certainly have done more and done better.  What Trump left for Biden was a smoking, sputtering machine with no plan for getting vaccines to the people.  Would we be talking about 100 million doses in 100 days if he was still president? Further, any credit he deserves on vaccines is vastly offset by his destructive lack of leadership both before and after the virus arrived in the US.  

To paraphrase Regan, ""The government is the problems when Republicans are in charge.""  From Rick Scott's sabotage of Florida's unemployment system to  Louis Dejoy's sabotage of the USPS, Republicans try to prove that government is ineffective by making it ineffective.  Now the Biden team says, ""We are from the government and we are here to help.""  I don't know about you, but I am deeply relieved and grateful."
2021-03-10 13:57:21,"Yes we should give credit where credit is due. Yes there were some in the Trump administration who made great efforts to roll out vaccine production. But no credit whatsoever should be given to Donald J. Trump who as president during the initial onslaught of the Covid19 pandemic actually did all the wrong things instead of trying to protect Americans from the novel corona virus. He defied medical expertise and instead made wild unfounded claims for which he had no evidence and no personal expertise. He worried more about the Covid19 epidemic as some sort of public relations challenge for his ultra-huge, ultra-fragile ego instead of a public health emergency. Yes, there were good people in the Trump administration who tried to do what was best for the country. Donald J. Trump was not one of them!"
2021-03-10 14:01:42,"Trump deserves partial credit for assisting in the rapid rate of virus production.  Unfortunately, the credit is offset by the years-long disinformation campaign from Trump that confused Americans and cost lives.  First, the virus was a hoax, then it was no worse than the flu, and then it was a biological weapon released by a Chinese military lab.  Masks weren't necessary, spread the disease faster, and even made people sick.  Social distancing was an attempt to implement a New World Order.  The list goes on and on.

This is like saying Nero had well-maintained streets while Rome burned."
2021-03-10 14:06:46,"To compare the performances of the two administrations as if they both started on a level playing field is unfair.  

Trump's administration had almost a year to get ready for the vaccine.  Biden's was formed after the election and then prevented from accessing information until it took office, or shortly before.  It then quickly got up to speed and went further than Trump's, as the article states:  pressuring companies to go 24/7, instituting the Defense Production Act, convincing two competitors to work together, J&J and Merck (!), etc.  

In addition to production, Biden's administration improved on the distribution of the vaccine.  Instead of leaving it all up to states to figure out, they set up 400+ FEMA vaccine administration sites nationwide.

Meanwhile, Trump claims victory for the vaccine itself-- when we all know that in a pandemic, the profit motive will ensure that Pharma will be going full steam to come up with a vaccine. Pfizer, the first, didn't even take OWS money for development.  

Biden has done a masterful job in just weeks.  It's what happens when you get experienced, competent people running things -- not your son-in-law or sycophants."
2021-03-10 14:17:32,"After having observed how the last administration botched the rollout of testing, and how they refused to marshal federal resources to the fullest extent possible for manufacture and distribution of PPE, it strains credulity to suggest that the vaccination picture today would be anywhere near where it is if Donald Trump had been re-elected with Jared Kushner behind the scenes thinking he knows everything and mucking up anything he touched."
2021-03-10 14:15:29,"Ao let me get this straight. Trump and his administration's actions, doing nothing and denying that there was a problem for months, is somehow overlooked in this article. Trump's actions are the reason over 500,000 people have died.  That's his legacy. Putting together a plan to get pharmaceutical companies to produce a vaccine to fight this pandemic, that's the job government is supposed to do. The Trump administration did not have a plan for distribution."
2021-03-10 14:10:30,"The Trump administration did less than nothing. They went out of their way to not do anything except try to claim credit for entirely normal commercial pharmaceutical product development and prevent other vaccines from reaching market. 

All the administrative machinery Trump put in place did more harm than it helped and had to be completely rebuilt. Even the most basic elements of their loose confederation of disparate groups and goals was best described as amateurish. More like a high school project than a strategic platform. 

In all honesty, everybody involved in the Trump vaccine process should be imprisoned."
2021-03-10 14:11:12,I can't help but wonder what the vaccine situation would be today if the former guy had won a second term. I only have to look at a state like Florida to see what might have been.  Give the former administration their credit for getting the vaccine going and developed early.  Give the Biden administration credit for the increased production and a viable delivery system.  There.  Now let's move on.
2021-03-10 14:02:47,The vaccine was created on Trump's watch. That's it. There was no plan or program to build on the get the vaccine out. It was only just live with testing. Just throw it off to the states.
2021-03-10 14:08:31,"If Trump had spent the two months between the election and the inauguration working on vaccine distribution, he would be entitled to take some credit. He did not. Instead it was more important to him to contest a free and fair election and incite his followers to riot. At that point, he and his administration forfeited all good will and credit for the deployment of the vaccine."
2021-03-10 12:26:46,"Trump gave us Operation Warpspeed - resulting in 3 approved vaccines and one more likely on the way.    Biden's luck was that the FDA and PFE held off on their vaccine data until a week after the election.   Meanwhile Democrats and their proxies talked down the vaccines.   While initial rollouts of any national program have fits and starts (in Trump's case it was the Holidays and weather), the national rollout was on track before Biden took office and vaccine output was always set to ramp from initial levels.   Lastly, the ridiculous Biden Merck announcement was a nothingburger.   Real reporters in the White House press briefing noted that the negotiation was already far down the road in January before Biden took office.   The press also fails to note that the output of that ""momentous"" deal won't come until September, by which time the vast majority of Americans over 16 will have been vaccinated - thanks to supply previously secured by Trump."
2021-03-10 13:45:53,"Biden's goal was 100M vaccinations in 100 days. But it appears that we will achieve 200M in 100 days. This is a proof that Americans are getting vaccinated according to a plan not designed by Biden, but designed by Trump. Since Biden is the president, he can claim some credit, but he doesn't deserve much credit. Without Trump, America and the world would have been in a long dark winter."
2021-03-10 13:59:30,"WOW!!  A headline and article that is actually not a hateful, ultra-partisan attack on Trump.

The facts are that overall Trump failed to effectively deal with the virus.  Many of his actions and words were counter-productive.  However, Trump did 2 things that were truly wise.  

One was the Warp Speed vaccine program.  Sure, it could have been tinkered with to make it even better (every program can be).  But the Warp Speed program is why the US has the vaccines that the whole world wants.  It is why those vaccines were tested and began going into our arms in less than 10 months instead of several years.  

Trump's one other wise action took political courage because it was politically incorrect at the time.  It was an action condemned by left-leaning people in the US and throughout the western world, as well as condemned by the China puppet World Health Organization.  Just a couple months later, though, the left in the rest of the western world came around and did the same as they condemned Trump for doing.  I refer to the ban on travelers from China which Trump imposed at end of January last year.  Canada, UK and Europe condemned him for it, refused to join the ban, and welcomed diseased travelers from China into their nations.  Then Trump failed us by failing to close our borders completely when those nations refused to join the travel ban.  After welcoming China's disease, those nations too late then closed their borders completely."
2021-03-10 12:33:16,"Trump has no standing to complain. He spent four years taking credit for everything Obama did right and blasting Obama for everything he, Trump, defined as wrong."
2021-03-10 13:54:22,That Trump wants to claim credit for anything regarding COVID would be laughable if only so many people weren’t dead because of his inaction.
2021-03-10 12:09:36,Biden has done a great job taking over the vaccine rollout from an uncaring and almost intentionally incompetent administration.
2021-03-10 13:39:24,"Trump getting any credit for the vaccine rollout is like applauding the farmer for closing the barn door after the horse has escaped. The man minimized the threat of the virus and flat out lied to all of us about the numbers! His only concern, as usual, was his own hide and wallet!"
2021-03-10 13:58:47,"This is revisionism at its worst. The Trump regime did all they could to hamper an effective national response to COVID. They deserve no credit for what the ""deep state"" was able to accomplish in spite of them."
2021-03-10 12:00:31,Kinda reminiscent of trump taking credit for the expanding economy he inherited
2021-03-10 12:50:56,"I’ll give Trump credit the minute he concedes that he lost a free, fair, fraud free election."
2021-03-10 13:28:47,Trump's help was creating the dire mess of the covid situation the US got in. Trump is like the arsonist that helps keep the firemen busy.
2021-03-10 13:57:47,"Competence matters.  Trumps handling of the vaccine was reasonable - although there were some baffling mistakes.  Trying to use it as an election prop by shortening the approval process will cost us in form of more people refusing to trust it.  Not making a big public deal of getting vaccinated himself was also a mistake.  Failure to understand that the defense production act needed to cover the full production chain, not just plastic syringes, was also incompetent.  
However, the biggest mistake of Trump was to turn a public health emergency into a political issue.  The US numbers of Covid-19 infected and dead people per million are a shameful monument to the incompetence of the Trump administration.  It is a disgrace that it took the Biden administration to mandate masks on federal property."
2021-03-10 11:52:23,"While there have been many rollout growing pains, I'm extremely impressed with how the federal government has (finally) adapted to the challenges. Informative articles like this one help me sort out politics from reality.    

Both the government and private industry have stepped up to expeditiously vaccine America... And soon, we will be helping the world!

But I struggle to give the Trump administration credit when the former President declared more than 38 times that Covid-19 is either going to disappear or is currently disappearing?!  How on earth does that attitude help motivate people to remove pending production barriers that will happen in 2021? 

Trump's false narrative energized his followers to ignore the science. That idiotic message helo enabled his people to inadvertently kill many Americans.  

Like many topics, Trump's minions are the problem and not the solution.  I give credit to all of the government workers behind the scenes that we're smart enough to ignore the advice of their ""leader"".  I bet most of the scientists in the trenches were outraged by his rhetoric.

So no, I'm not willing to give any credit to the administration that was a major part of the problem.
Signed,
A Republican"
2021-03-10 14:19:32,"The writer of this piece provides little evidence that the Trump Adminustration got the ball rolling on vaccine production. In the first instance, there was no factual comparison to the plan ""Warp Speed"" and actions taken. The head of Pfizer even said that Trump Administration could take no credit. Second,  the states were told they were on their own to purchase vaccines and roll them out.Third, still no word on what what happened to 20 million doses the Trump Administration bought but were ""lost"" in the distribution cycle- it reminds me of the  $8 billion cash the Bush Administration lost on the tarmac of an airfield in Iraq. Investigative journalists should not whitewash incompetence, they should root it out. And while quoting members of the Biden team, there is a failure to name or quote Trump Admin sources- why? If they seriously want to rehab their own performance, let's hear directly from them, not simply quote them as stating, The Biden Administration is following their playbook."
2021-03-10 14:08:43,"Say what? The Trump administration did every possible thing to slow-walk the reaction to the virus. OK , they can have 5%. I mean they sat stony-faced while Trump talked about bleach and UV light. In those early months, remember how he ridiculed testing and isolation techniques and  the virulence of the Virus. The real heroes here are the much maligned  Pharmaceutical companies that, in blinding speed, developed and put into production the highly effective Vaccines that will quench this virus."
2021-03-10 13:55:30,"Lets not forget that Trump hid the truth about the virus. He failed to follow the science.  He called out experts and claimed they didn't know what they were talking about.  That he in fact knew more about the virus then they did. He claimed it would all be over when the nice weather came.  500,000 plus dead and he wants to claim credit for the rollout of the vaccine ?? There was no rollout plan when Biden took over.  Biden was pushing the science before he took office. The Biden administration has done more to fight the virus in a month then the Trump administration did in 11 months. Rather then take credit for the rollout of the vaccine the Trump administration should admit that they are responsible for a bungled response to pandemic."
2021-03-10 14:07:01,"I am not one to shower Trump with undo praise, but he did help usher in the money as a HUGE financial incentive to the various drug companies to develop this vaccine at ""warp speed"".

Of course, the flip side of these silver dollars is his repeated delay for months and months in acknowledging the real dangers and effects of COVID.

In the end, NO ONE person accomplished this behemoth feat on his own, but rather the orchestrated efforts by many to develop, produce and ""roll out"" this vaccine.

The scientists at Oxford University have been working on this project for over a year and a half and they are just one  scientific team of many in the world continuing to develop various vaccines.

Congratulations to the scientists and medical research teams in the world!!!  You folks rock and roll!  Thank you for helping save millions of lives."
2021-03-10 12:32:56,"I don’t think the 520,000 dead Americans care about who gets credit at this point. We as a society should channel more Mother Teresa and less of an egocentric need for credit, whatever that is."
2021-03-10 13:35:37,"Well, trump never gave Obama any credit for handing him an economy that was steadily improving."
2021-03-10 12:28:37,"For the the GOP when they are in office they demand all  good credit belongs to them.  Not so quick, they are not in office and the present administration gets the credit!!"
2021-03-10 13:44:33,"I've recommended at least the first 20 reader comments to this article, all of which were aghast that Trump was given credit for anything to help reduce the death toll in the US.  I didn't see readers questioning if Fox News somehow slipped this article into the NYT, or if readers were cancelling their subscriptions, yet.  So, I guess the writers can at least take credit for catching the attention of readers, but this is not the proper standard to follow.  

President Biden and his team have not attacked former President Trump, who has repeatedly and often outrageously attacked almost everyone else to claim praise for himself … even over President Lincoln.  It’s actually, the reverse, with the former guy denying the results of the 2020 election. This headline comes close to perpetrating another falsehood only the former President could imagine and use for his own purposes."
2021-03-10 13:54:27,Thankfully the numbers seem to be slowly going down of this terrible pandemic. The scientists and drug companies deserve all of the credit & not the politicians or high level aides of either party. Trump's many Covid mis-steps probably cost him another term yet Biden can not even remember the name of his senior cabinet members (Defense Secretary) so giving him credit for the nuts and bolts of vaccine distribution is laughable.
2021-03-10 13:59:32,"All Trump had to do would have been to encourage and facilitate universal mask adherence and he would still be president today, maybe even with that Nobel Prize he so badly wanted in his clutches as well.  His ego and inability to see any kind of big picture beyond his most self-centered impulses got in the way and kept that from happening.  He's really not a very bright guy."
2021-03-10 13:54:17,"The partisan whining and  posturing for ""credit"" for the development and roll out of the covid vaccines is distasteful and pathetic.

Yes, vaccine development was well funded with taxpayer money and some folks worked very hard.  Some good decisions were made.  Good.  But so what?  That is what is expected of public servants when the country is faced with a crisis of any kind.  I have never seen municipal, let alone volunteer fire departments, jostling over which among them deserves the ""credit"" for putting out the huge mutual aid fire at the warehouse.  

The credit belongs to those scientists who toiled in anonymity for years and years, whose research made these revolutionary vaccines even possible, and to the thousands of scientists, worldwide, whose collaboration brought about the development of these vaccines in record time."
2021-03-10 14:18:32,"The difference between the two is that Trump would brag about doing the job he was supposed to do all along, like we're are blessed that he showed up to work."
2021-03-10 14:18:42,"Give credit where credit is due.

The most valuable contribution Trump made to vaccine success was losing interest in putting himself at the center of any and all vaccine logistics."
2021-03-10 14:19:24,"I separate Trump's downplaying of the virus from the support the government gave the pharmaceutical industry in developing the vaccine.

Trump's claims about it being a hoax made up by Democrats, it will go away when it gets warmer, maybe Clorox will help, and most importantly, making jokes about mask wearing, directly caused many, many deaths that could have been avoided.  History will be unkind to his COVID-19 response.

The Trump administration did, however, create the atmosphere for the drug companies to develop vaccines in record time.  Warp speed, if you will.

If he only listened to the experts in epidemiology sooner versus quack doctors and sycophantic politicians, we would have had vaccines months earlier and far fewer deaths.

God bless those who passed and God bless their loved ones."
2021-03-10 14:27:52,"Research into the mRNA approach to vaccines had preceded the COVID pandemic by quite a bit, and enabled early production of Pfizer and Moderna vaccines. To that point, the academic and research communities should be thanked before we start heaping praise on the politicians. 
Trump does get some credit for having in place people who saw the need to accelerate vaccine adaptation and production. I doubt seriously if Trump personally deserves one iota of credit for that, rather I think it was a happy accident of fate that the cogs of the various wheels happened to be happily meshed at the right time. 
It is abundantly clear that prior to Biden's arrival, there was little coherence in planning for actual allocation and deployment of the vaccines. The notion that it should be up to the states was just another example of kicking the can down the road and hoping someone else would give it a kick. 
Most unfortunate however is the ongoing problem that we will continue to have, that relating to non-existence of a forward looking national health system that pays proper attention to warnings about emerging diseases and which takes action before the bugs actually hit. CDC and NIH and of course the hidebound FDA are reactive to immediate threats, and frankly during the early days of the COVID crisis were more of an impediment than a resource. Remember the CDC botched test kits, lack of contact tracing and no plan at all. 
Next pandemic? Likely the same scramble."
2021-03-10 14:35:49,"It really can’t be ignored that the former president is also credited with advising Americans not to worry about this virus and keeping secret his own vaccination in the White House instead of using that as an opportunity to encourage acceptance of the vaccine.

As the writer points out, Trump refused to invoke the Defense Production Act to speed up vaccine production, President Biden did just that early on.  That makes it seem the Trump administration’s Operation Warp Speed to create vaccines while a good thing, was the end in itself.  Delivering them to the public was given little active planning until the new administration took charge.
It’s very hard to find much to be grateful about regarding Donald Trump’s administration except for its  conclusion."
2021-03-10 14:43:47,"I sometimes feel that journalists blindly follow a dictate to be bipartisan but don't understand economics. Pfizer was not part of Operation Warp Speed, yet it was the first to gain approval. That is free market at work both in terms of motivating companies but also the personnel therein including scientists, no credit to Trump. Where government intervention was needed more was in overcoming the logistics of getting production rapidly because suppliers of raw materials and machinery would have had to honor existing contracts first unless the Government intervened. This is where the Biden Administration showed both muscle and innovativeness."
2021-03-10 14:45:21,"Donald Trump’s administration does deserve credit for the matter of pushing to have the vaccine developed. This action has greatly helped in the overall process of getting a final product available for use. But Mr. Trump never took the virus seriously, or cared about its overall impact on our people and our country, whereas Joe Biden did, even before he won the election. And President Biden understood the entire virus scenario, medical, economic and logistical. He also saw the people affected as actual people, not just as statistics or to be used as a media opportunity. Leadership, especially in a crisis, starts from the top and we are seeing today the stark differences in administrations. And our country is benefiting from it."
2021-03-10 14:46:04,"The ""Trump administration"" is not the same as ""Trump."" To my understanding, Trump wanted to ignore the pandemic entirely, and was only reluctantly dragged along by federal public health experts as well as WH personnel who persuaded him that he was risking his reelection. The positive steps toward vaccine production were effected by the same government career personnel whom Trump made a brand out of denigrating and insulting. I see ""Trump's"" legacy in the convoluted sign-up process that frustrates and discourages so many people, especially the elderly and vulnerable."
2021-03-10 11:52:03,"Trump deserves credit for vaccine?  The same Trump who was vaccinated before he left the White House, but refused to even let the public know, who mocked wearing masks, called the pandemic the flu?  That’s the guy who should be praised. The very idea is absurd. Now many of his supporters are leading the anti vax charge and burning masks, which will only prolong the crisis. Trump deserves to be ridiculed for making the pandemic far worse than it had to be. Anything positive from his administration most certainly was not because of him, so give the credit to those who deserve it, not him."
2021-03-10 13:02:25,"For Trump, getting a vaccine approved for use before the November election was voter bait and nothing more. For Biden getting Americans vaccinated is a mission to save us and our society. Enough said."
2021-03-10 13:53:00,"When Americans remember who was President of the United States when they finally received their vaccination, it will be Joe Biden.  

Americans will remember Donald Trump as the guy who lied about and downplayed the deadly Covid-19 virus all year. He will be the one responsible for severe illness and death in massive numbers that did not have to happen."
2021-03-10 14:24:38,"Patently untrue, fake news! Had Trump put in any effort into curbing and addressing this crisis, things would have jelled a long time prior. Biden came in, knew how to organize and distribute and immediately got results, plain and simple!"
2021-03-10 14:15:16,"So djt deserves credit for the advances in science that made development of a vaccine a year after discovery of a new virus possible for the first time in human history?  ￼Yeah, right....however, I will gladly give him credit for mobilizing a zombie army who will continue to tear down our democracy rather than share it with the rest of us."
2021-03-10 12:03:49,"I don't blame the Trump people for growling a bit.  ""You're taking credit for our own accomplishments,"" they mutter.  

But you know, New York Times--Mr. Trump was president for four years.  He'd been, of course, a major public figure long before that.  And I honestly do believe--

--we Americans had a pretty reliable picture of Mr. Donald J. Trump.  

His policies--his plans--his priorities--all these things!  They were ABOUT--Mr. Donald J. Trump.  ""What'll make me look good?""  ""What'll get my base riled up--excited--screaming?""  ""Every day,"" he told his staff, ""is the beginning of a day that'll be on TV.""  

I'm not denying--no, not for a moment! that Mr. Trump accomplished things.  He wasn't wholly INERT during those four years.  

But I strongly believe, a successful president (in a manner of speaking) has got to GIVE himself to stuff.  It's NOT about him, fundamentally--not in the long run.  It's about the people he serves.  Or is supposed to serve.  

At the end of the day, Mr. Trump was about serving--

--himself.  

I think we all knew that.  

I think we know it now."

2021-03-10 13:56:51,"What Trump deserves credit for is doing everything he could to spread the virus at his super spreader events and killing 527,000 people to date with phony machismo about wearing masks and forcing businesses to open prematurely. The development of the vaccine was not a “miracle” that he produced by waving a wand - it was the ONLY step he took in close to a year to do anything about the crisis at all. And then he lied and sulked about losing the election instead of doing everything he could to protect Americans. THAT is his legacy. Utter failure to get the virus under control. Oh yeah - and threatening to keep the vaccine from states with Democratic Governors. 

Biden approached the task with thoughtful planning, a respect for science, and common sense as a leader should. Let’s be clear about what took place here."

2021-03-10 13:18:11,"It's news, of course, to report on how the government has handled the vaccinations, but to play the story as Trump vs. Biden, with a clickbait headline, only reinforces the good-guy vs. bad guy partisanship that is poisoning our political discourse."
2021-03-10 14:26:55,"NYT still sucking up to Trump. Pfizer and other vaccine developers started working on a vaccine in January of 2020 as soon as the Chinese released the genetic sequence of Covid-19. Both Pfizer and Moderna built on decades of research on rMNA and based their vaccines on that research. Did Trump’s push and extra funding cut the time to market? I have doubts because it was in the financial interests of both companies to get their vaccines to market as soon as possible. One could also argue that Trump may have delayed the final vaccines because neither company wanted to be seen as selling unreliable vaccines pushed to market to help  Trump win reelection. There were many news articles in the Fall, including here, that reported the public’s skepticism about taking a vaccine that had not been adequately tested because Trump was pressuring PFizer and Moderna to release their tests results to the FDA before the election. I’m not saying that Trump gets no credit for helping move the vaccine forward, but let’s be a little more honest with headlines. Biden got virtually no help from Trump with the vaccine rollout because the Trump team had no plan in place for the rollout."
2021-03-10 12:34:45,"Trump labeled Covid 19 as a ""Democrat Hoax"" even though he had been briefed on the virus and how dangerous it was months earlier.

He bragged about ""Operation Warp Speed"" which wasn't officially instituted until May 15 2020.  O.W.S. should have been rolled out months earlier.

Trump ridiculed medical experts and encouraged his followers to disregard wearing masks. The first thing he did when released from the hospital was rip off his mask. His  political rallies were deemed major spreader events.

The only thing that Donald ever did for SARS COV 2 was accelerate it's spread across America."
2021-03-10 14:49:11,"Giving trump credit for the success of the vaccine effort is like giving credit to a fireman who sets a building on fire, turns on a trickle of water from the hydrant, drops the hose and goes to get a cup of coffee."
2021-03-10 12:24:43,"Nope! trump threw away the pandemic preparedness playbook that was left for him by the Obama/Biden administration. He recalled observers from the exact area of China where the virus originated. He used his racism to guide policy in initially banning flights from China but not Europe. He then repeatedly lied to the American public about the potential severity of the virus. When he had a choice of digging down and finding a way to combat this run away problem he instead passed responsibility to the individual states to fight it out amongst themselves in order to get PPE. He refused invoke the Defense Production Act, or to issue a mask mandate, openly mocked and encouraged his supporters to mock anyone who wore masks. Once States started to figure out ways to mitigate the crisis he demanded that they be “liberated” in almost every way, including holding superspreader events, trump made our situation worse. The fact that something helpful was actually initiated during his administration had absolutely nothing to do with trump. No he deserves no credit whatsoever."

The other is a malignant narcissist who only cares about what happens to him. He gaslighted everyone constantly and told approximately 30,000 lies in four years.

Trump exhibits all of these symptoms: From the Mayo Clinic: 
1) Have an exaggerated sense of self-importance.
2) Have a sense of entitlement and require constant, excessive admiration.
3) Expect to be recognized as superior even without achievements that warrant it.
4) Exaggerate achievements and talents.
5) Be preoccupied with fantasies about success, power, brilliance, beauty or the perfect mate.
6) Believe they are superior and can only associate with equally special people.
7) Monopolize conversations and belittle or look down on people they perceive as inferior.
8) Expect special favors and unquestioning compliance with their expectations
9) Take advantage of others to get what they want
10) Have an inability or unwillingness to recognize the needs and feelings of others."

Nowhere else in the entire world was the wearing of masks, the only protection we had until a vaccine was developed, made into a political issue.

Compare our deaths per capita to all the other countries. 
Maybe  200, 000 or more deaths because Trump and his party told Americans not to wear masks. 
They are still spreading the lie about masks as variants of Covid emerge.

There’s your headline."

You mean the guy who ordered half of what they offered to sell him in highly effective vaccine, had no plans to distribute it effectively, did everything he could to make it worse and secretly took his own shots at the front of the line instead of providing an example by doing it on TV? THAT guy?

Get the News: Putting in a few orders and the FDA Emergency Approving Vaccine is the absolute MINIMUM any fool could have done. 

Between Mask Denial and Covid Misinformation Trump killed hundreds of thousands of people and even when it came time for the vaccine he was asleep at the wheel. 

Trump gets NO credit. 

Only Damnation for what he has done and worse.. failed to do when all the chips were down and America needed a real leader."
2021-03-10 12:25:35,"Interesting, that the only thing I’d give Trump credit for is “Operation Warp Speed”. He doesn’t tout his accomplishment in this area.

Meanwhile his base is anti mask and vaccine, hampering our March to herd immunity. What a shame."

It doesn't matter that there are a million asterisks next to those statements because most voters do not care. 

Democrats must continue to prioritize making life better for people in every single action they take. Biden is off to a good start, but people look at results and most do not care about political intrigue - they care about taking care of themselves and their family."

2021-03-10 12:50:29,"One of the last reports on Trump and his administration in this paper and mainstream media was from the Governors of the states, aghast that he had lied one more time.

Remember  when Trump, for no reason other than his own sociopathy and twisted ignorance, decided to can that whole initiative ?

Trump's idea of ""public service "" amidst a pandemic is he gets 5 star medical treatment for his own COVID (and later gets a vaccine in secret) and you just slobber all over each other ""to be free"", and write his new MAGA PAC a check to fund  his unending campaign of lies."

But in every other respect, the Trump Administration response to covid was grossly incompetent and willfully negligent.  For Trump to boast about vaccine development is like a failing student boasting that he got 20% on an exam instead of 0%.

Further, I strongly believe that Trump's saw ""Operation Warp Speed"" almost entirely as a tactic to get himself re-elected, and not as a project to save American lives.  When the pandemic exploded in November and December, the president ignored the crisis.  Instead, he focused exclusively on lying about a ""rigged election"" and plotting his illegal scheme to stay in power despite the clear decision of U.S voters to fire him."
2021-03-10 12:32:56,"Trump, with his proud non-masking and coronavirus denialist attitude, aided and abetted the deaths of many thousands of Americans.

His legacy will be ""American carnage"".

Even after contracting coronavirus himself at his mask-free White House and receiving the best medical care and medicine in the world at Walter Reed Medical Center last fall, he recklessly said “I didn't have to go in frankly, I think it would have gone away by itself”.

The former guy was - and is - a threat to public health, public safety and national security."

Second: trump ignored Covid and vaccines from November 3- January 30th.  We had over 200,000 deaths during that interval without a single tweet.
Third: trump did not publicly get vaccine in news media

Trump almost died from covid and pretended like he was Superman, despite getting life saving treatment not available to anyone.  His own brother likely died from covid, as cause remains a family matter."
2021-03-10 14:29:02,"The key difference in the two administrations was the Trump WH’s failure to communicate a clear action plan to fight COVID on ALL public health fronts. While Trump’s White House deserves credit for delivering on WARP speed, they eroded public confidence with their lies about transmission and their disgusting entwining of loss of “freedom” and mask wearing, We lost precious time as they pandered to their base. That is the “mess” the Biden White House refers to. So to be “fair” there is no comparison between the two administrations. Biden’s WH is fighting the pandemic on all fronts."

Now it “laid the groundwork.” Well so did Dolly Parton but you didn’t mention her contribution. 
This is a clear sign of the damaged priorities of the Times as it persistently legitimizes the most outrageous malfeasance in order to preserve the indefensible idea that the GQP is a party of serious legislators rather than a horde of inchoate grievance dedicated to distracting outrage and minority voter suppression."

Trump ignored, downplayed, politicized and attempted to profit off the Pandemic (bogus hydroqloroquine claims). He became bored with COVID early on and passed off management of the federal response to Jared Kushner, who had no experience or medical background and also sought to profit off the deaths and suffering of US citizens.
The incompetence and epic failure of the Trump administration to contain the disease early on thru proven public health measures like masks,
distancing, lockdowns etc. has resulted in the deaths of over 500,000 Americans and counting. Trump, Kushner et al deserve jail not ‘credit’. 
Thank God Trump lost the election and we may be slowly returning to some semblance of normal life. This article’s attempt to whitewash the criminal negligence of the Trump admin. is wrong and frankly offensive."

We saw what happened with our own eyes over the past year with vaccines being developed and produced simultaneously to fight the spread of Covid-19. We were in the Trump sponsored ""Warp Speed"" mode. The reason the USA is where it is today, which is a good place to be regarding its Covid-19 vaccine production, distribution and administration is largely because  Donald Trump and his administration with their plans and actions pushed manufacturers to pull out all the stops to create vaccines in an extraordinary short amount of time and where necessary supplied them with funds to help them. Joe Biden's words and actions if any did little to put us in this good position with respect to the Covid-19 fight and our enviable position regarding vaccines to protect the USA and the World.  It seems that Joe Biden can hardly give a speech without a teleprompter or answer questions that are not given to him in advance so his staff can get the answers to him before he is officially asked the question and clearly is not going to last the rest of 2021."

It is such a relief having a real President working on this pandemic problem.  

As others have posted herein, I give Trump very little credit for anything related to COVID.  He denied its danger, brought on politicization of mask-wearing by telling us HE would not be seen wearing one (and his cult proudly followed) and now gloats that only he could have brought the vaccines to us so quickly.

They are just doing the work and communicating what’s happening without hype or fanfare.

Or when he ordered testing to slow down to hide the number of Americans who were infected with Covid across the country? Or when he mocked the idea of wearing masks, and then those Americans who did wear them? Or was it when our hospitals were short on PPEs? Or was it when he replaced an infectious disease expert with a neurologist? Trump helps Trump. And IF a few crumbs hit the floor at that moment is the only time he 'helps' any one else. That is and has been Trump's entire character in a nutshell."
2021-03-10 14:45:42,"This is a good, balanced article.  One of the only things Trump did well was operation warp speed."
2021-03-10 14:34:33,"Whom are you going to believe?

Are you going to believe that Jared and his buds with no experience in managing public health, + a labradoodle breeder with no public credentials, laid the groundwork for a successful rollout of CoVid-19 vaccines?  

A more likely scenario, in my view, is that the Biden Administration did inherit disorder and dysfunction, just as they said they did.

We are now forming just the first draft of history.  However, there is some information on the record from the period of the pandemic to help assess if the Trump people's claims are credible."
2021-03-10 14:22:14,I despaired of ever getting a vaccination with the other guy and his son in law in charge.  I'm getting my follow up vaccination next week.  I feel like there's progress with Biden/Harris I felt nothing but anxiety with Trump/Pence.
2021-03-10 14:35:38,"Credit goes to Trump for getting the R&D fast tracked - no doubt about that. But he dropped the ball when it came to delivery of the vaccine to people. He failed to follow through with a plan to distribute the vaccines and blamed the states for not having a plan in place. Then, he was paralyzed with obsession to overturn the election after he lost, and stopped governing completely. Biden has been able to finish the job without inserting himself into the conversation every moment of every day. He deserves credit for governing, leading and follow through."
2021-03-10 14:32:17,"The amazing scientists get credit for the creation of the vaccines.  

Ask yourself why we lost a year of our lives to the pandemic?  Donald Trump actively would not lead and was destructive.  Had he tried to put in place a simple, even flawed national strategy at the beginning for mitigation without blaming states we would not have lost nearly a half a million people. 

For two months after the election, if he had an ounce of care for the American people, Trump could have worked with Biden on a transition plan for vaccinations.  But, it was all about him and the big lie.  And, eventually about the insurrection and money. 

No, Trump’s legacy is not tied to the recovery from the pandemic.  I saw no care for the American people at any time, just lies.  

In November, we voted for a President who could dig us out of this mess.  I just want it done.  And, so far, just the effort made is a huge improvement."
2021-03-10 14:41:23,"It is interesting to hear complaints from the previous president’s team that they are not getting enough credit. Especially in light of the fact that they inherited a robust economy with strong job growth while never, ever, to this day giving Obama an ounce of recognition while claiming he created the best economic growth ever. (BTW, that was one of his 13,000 lies.). PB"
2021-03-10 14:42:24,"Yeah, because Trump and his administration was working 24/7 on fighting the pandemic for the past year. Please.

Credit for the vaccines goes neither to Biden nor Trump, but to the scientists who have been working on Messenger RNA (MRNA) vaccine technology for the last 30 years.  Where would we be without their efforts? They're the ones who've made it possible to develop virus specific vaccines so quickly. They're the ones who have made it possible for us to quickly develop new vaccines for new strains of the virus.

Trump deserves no credit for vaccines. Biden won't ask for any. But the Biden administration did start with nothing from Trump for distribution and efforts to actually get vaccine in arms. Trump thought his job was done once people started developing vaccines. But the pandemic pushed vaccine development, not Trump."
2021-03-10 14:43:32,"Of course both administrations deserve credit for the focus and progress in getting Americans vaccinated. I keep asking myself has it always been this way? Where the parties refuse to give any credit for anything the other does? Or is it the reporting that's changed, reveling in any opportunity to stir the proverbial pot. After all, this article has no story if the divide isn't in the headline."
2021-03-10 14:43:57,"Certainly we should be very grateful for the work of those in the Trump administration who worked behind the scenes for the public good (and likely under difficult circumstances), but let's resist the urge to include Trump the president in that group. 

We must not forget the numerous ways Trump could have shown some leadership to change the trajectory of the pandemic but choose not to, with catastrophic results: dismissing Covid as a ""hoax,"" followed by privately recognizing the gravity of the situation but refusing to level with the public, politicizing masks and flaunting public health guidelines, sidelining medical experts in favor of those with no competence in the field, hosting WH super spreader events with impunity, and lastly, refusing to use own vaccination as an example that could have encouraged his followers to do the same. 

Trying to whitewash January 6 may be the latest craze, but let's not do the same thing here."
2021-03-10 14:49:18,"Saving lives by strategic planning and critical thinking is how Biden set us back on the path towards stability. On the other hand, former President Trump’s strategy was denial, obstruction, and finally a desperate strategy to save his presidency. 

Yes operation warp speed produced vaccines in record time — however, effective distribution of the vaccine is required to save lives. There’s nothing to admire about someone who pushes a person of the bridge in order to stage a dramatic rescue."
2021-03-10 14:25:00,The supplier who was encouraged to ramp up production was in all likelihood showered with Federal money to keep the line running 24/7.  What company would not take this deal?
2021-03-10 14:37:26,"The vaccine rollout isn't humming in my state.  My governor keeps complaining we're not getting enough vaccine, but there was no real distribution plan, lousy means for making appointments, and why aren't they using doctors office and health departments locally to give the vaccine?  I'm not eligible yet but the options for people who don't have cars (I don't) at this point are limited. So when I am eligible am I also going to have to spend $25-30 on an Uber ride for a ""free"" vaccine?  The only thing Mass seems to have done right so far in contrast to many states was to vaccinate its incarcerated population."
2021-03-10 15:03:28,"Let’s give credit where credit is due. No, it is not to any politician from any party. Rather the credit goes to drug companies and their scientists, doctors and production employees who developed and produce the vaccines. And let’s not forget about all of the medical personnel, transportation workers and others  who are administering the local and regional storage and vaccination centers. These are the people down in the trenches and are the real heroes."
2021-03-10 14:47:37,"That’s quite a headline. But it’s true that Trump’s actions, at least in the area of vaccines,  leaned towards helpful. Let’s give a shout-out to the grumpy head of Warpspeed Moncef Slaoui too, who wasn’t mentioned in the article."
2021-03-10 13:13:49,"If Trump wants credit— as always, for anything and everything successful — he and his craven sycophants and cronies must also take the blame for their role in exacerbating the devastation. Their corrupt motivations and gas-lighting of the American people effectively killed us by the hundreds of thousands. And they’re still at it. In my heart and mind, they are and will always be traitors."
2021-03-10 14:53:36,"Trump crew “inadvertently “ killed thousands of COVID victims.   

I don’t think inadvertently at all.   

They always made clear they did not like people of color, who have borne such a disproportionate level of illness and death during the pandemic.  You can’t tell me that that wasn’t a predictable, but for Trumpists a welcome, effect of their lack of planning, action, or empathy!"

With the incompetent, ego maniac demagogue Trump, who could not come up with a solution to a problem if it was handed to him, any success came from his underlings.

With Biden, who is at least half way competent, he and his underlings deserve the credit."
2021-03-10 14:00:58,I'm not sure I read anything that I would give the previous administration credit for. The headline is misleading.
2021-03-10 14:17:56,"Forget about Trump. He’s responsible for at least one-half of the deaths from COVID. If he had done what Washington Governor Inslee did there would be 200,000 fewer deaths. He effectively killed them with carelessness and lies and incompetence. He deserves nothing but contempt."
2021-03-10 12:56:57,"This is exactly why I cancelled my subscription. The Times continues prostrating itself for “both sides” when any thinking person knows the truth; Trump did everything in his power to obfuscate, lie and create chaos regarding the vaccine and COVID itself and nothing to help the American people. 

How dare you give him credit when private businesses were responsible for development, not to mention his interference with the CDC and NIH may well have caused the needless deaths of thousands if not millions of people. 

When he took office, Biden was presented with no plans for distributions and limited vaccine  supply. He and his staff quickly changed both to help rectify the debacle and the progress they’ve made in a few short weeks has been truly admirable. There is no comparison."
2021-03-10 15:00:28,"Please NYT don’t create myths by simplifying accounts. As many here are pointing out, it’s one thing that some in the past administration did foster vaccine production, it’s another to cede the credit that belongs to others to a corrupt office holder whose actions were obstructive, irrational, demagogic, and inept, thus contributing to the spread of the pandemic and hampering its remediation.

Your deadline needs be clarified accordingly."

2. Biden planned and pushed the program vaccine forward.

2021-03-10 14:18:09,"Thanks to the former man in office, over half a million Americans were needlessly and recklessly exposed to this deadly pathogen - the aftermath of which will be felt for generations to come.

It is IMMATERIAL that there are ""grumbles"" from former administration officials. They are complicit. They should ALL face charges of manslaughter, if not treason.

2021-03-10 15:15:06,The pieces may have been in place but what does that matter when they just sat dormant?  The trump administration did absolutely nothing to protect the American people from Covid at any point.  And the republican party on just about every level continues to put any and all road blocks in place to keep it that way.  They have demonstrated for years they have no regard for the majority of American whatsoever.
2021-03-10 12:16:48,Trump can’t claim credit for achievements without also accepting responsibility for his colossal failures. That’s how leadership works.

2021-03-10 14:40:51,"On the day Biden took office on Jan 20th, he inherited two vaccines, a vaccine distribution plan, nearly 1mm doses administered per day (and trending steeply up being limited by supply), two stimulus packages that helped people and save the economy, and a death rate in the US that was not the worst, but not the best, and certainly not a consistent story among Democrat/Republican states. He inherited an economy that was forecast, as of Jan 20th, for tremendous growth and job creation this year and next, reflecting the bipartisan discussions in December of $0.6-1 trillion of additional stimulus (the third such plan).

We definitely got the funding in the third stimulus under bipartisan discussion in December. Plus: funds to state/local government including states with revenues higher in 2020 than 2019, bailouts (indirect) of state pension plans and multiemployer pension plans, funding to K-12 schools looking for a purpose (prior funds are still almost all unspent). Most of these additional funds won't contribute much to economic growth -- not productive capital economically. Child care credits that seem meritorious were not subject to real debate, even among Democrats.

Ironically, the size of the unneeded ""stimulus"" will cause inflation eroding all of the buying power of the $1400 checks granted to the very people that Democrats purport to help.

After Jan 20th: Economically, not impressed. Virus response, not impressed. Progressive takeover of the Democratic party -- scary."
2021-03-10 12:56:32,"The NYTimes gave so little credit to what Trump accomplished in his term that perhaps this is a way to throw him a bone. I’m not defending Trump’s worse moments, because in the end he got his just rewards. However, he didn’t sit on his hands entirely over the last 4 years."
2021-03-10 15:38:52,"However miraculous the timeframe was for vaccine development, it was due to competent collaboration between academia and big pharmaceutical and would have been even faster with assistance and coordination from the federal government. To the extent Trump has contributed at all, it was to fail to order sufficient doses and coordinate roll out. He is also responsible for widespread mistrust of COVID science among his followers, many of whom now won’t get vaccinated."
2021-03-10 15:39:03,"Giving the former guy’s administration any credit for positive steps handling this pandemic is like giving fans credit when their team wins a championship.

At every step along the way, Trump gummed up the works, sowed confusion, handicapped the scientists and slowed the distribution of respirators and personal protection equipment.  It's only through sheer luck that five million didn't die before Biden took charge."
2021-03-10 14:56:41,"No doubt. We would not have vaccines if it was not for Trump. That guy got, in my view, just two things right in four years:

Putting lots of money for developing and producing the vaccines and,

The peace treaties of Israel with Arab countries.

The horrible handling of the rest of the pandemic and the hate speech cost him the White House.

By contrast, Biden in just in less than two months got the economic rescue package right, is taken care of fixing Trump aberrations like quitting the Paris Agreement and, does not brag (or Tweet about it). Plus TPF for Venezuelans. God bless him."

In the 1st place the issue is unworthy of news reporting. In the 2nd place, it is irresponsible to treat the Trump administration as anything like normal. As others have commented, Trump didn't save people from Covid, he caused more deaths than would have been the case with sane, responsible leadership. Shame."

It was not. Many of the comments express for me the utter wrongness of giving the former president credit so I won't waste my time here any longer.  What are we giving him credit for? Studies will show eventually the terrible toll for which he was responsible- essentially a crime against humanity. If the NYT would like to parse this utter disregard for the lives of US citizens to say, oh, but, but, but, then I have lost ALL respect.  This is it for me. I am furious. Subscription cancelled."

How NICE that after systematically denying the pandemic crisis, falsifying data, lying and distorting the facts and threatening - actually supporting - politicization of the crisis killing hundreds of thousands of Americans, the Trump administration managed to do some work to prepare for dealing with vaccines.

This shabby and dishonest ""balancing"" that the Times has conducted over the last five years has contributed to the ""fake news"" we have endured. Except in this case the fakery has been on the side of the Trumpians and the GOP, with the added horror that if I dare to call them and the Times out properly I shall be considered ""uncivil.""

The capstone to his administration's stupidity and mismanagement is the fact (which only recently came out) that the President and his wife had actually gotten their vaccine shots long ago in total secrecy.  Can one imagine a more outrageous slap in the face to US citizenry?  He must have considered receiving his shot equivalent to wearing a mask.

Second. 

The Trump administration as a matter of policy worked against science most every step of the way in response to the pandemic and in the development of the vaccine.

It is very evident that Trump botched his initial response to the virus he initially said was a hoax, delaying adequate response and then undermining science by constantly blowing hot air filled with Lysol and hydroxychloroquine and miracles of warmer weather.  

Worst of all, trump politicized mask-wearing, which included his tweets that his people should LIBERATE three states from control measures.  These tweets-to-incitement were particularly awful in that they no doubt contributed to the pastiche of trump's incitements that led to the ransacking of the U.S. Capitol.

The updated definition of chutzpah."
2021-03-10 13:58:19,"By May there will be a huge glut of vaccine in the US. Whereas over 50 and first responders demand was at least 80%, the government will lucky to have 50% participation by under 50 and Blacks. Two bright spots will be if they can approve and start students by midsummer. And then divert remaining surplus to badly needed poorer countries for next winter."
2021-03-10 14:47:03,Joe Biden has not played one round of golf since inaguration day. The tremendous results speak for themselves.
2021-03-10 13:44:23,"Certainly enormous credit is due the scientists and administrators who made this rapid vaccine development possible, but I’m guessing it was despite “Trump the man” (rather than “Trump the White House”) rather than because of him. I bet there are many behind the scenes stories of his ignorant obstructions, one of them being quite well know, that he turned down Pfizer’s offer of a 100 millions doses—probably because he was mad at them— <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/07/us/trump-covid-vaccine-pfizer.html"" target=""_blank"">https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/07/us/trump-covid-vaccine-pfizer.html</a> 

But the devil’s in the details, isn’t it? What good is a rapidly developed vaccine if it’s so hard to get, people give up trying? That’s what the early roll-out was like. We can all second guess—wouldn’t any president of any party have enabled a rapid vaccine development? What would the vaccine roll-out have looked like if Hillary Clinton had been the president? It’s not hard to make educated guesses."
2021-03-10 15:30:38,"So the party of ""Covid hoax,"" ""It's just the flu,"" and ""Those scientists don't know everything"" now want credit for the job the grownups did?"

yes, some credit to Trump for getting the vaccine-creation process going but his dithering will be remembered as  genocidal and will rank him among the worst Presidents.

Biden made clear that vaccine production and distribution would be his priority, and he's focused on it without childish drama or the need for self-aggrandizement"
2021-03-10 15:40:55,Imagine what TFG could have accomplished if only he had not underestimated the virus. I am pretty sure ( although I shudder thinking of it) he would have been re-elected. He has the GOP to thank for their refusal of the 2000 dollar stimulus check!

2021-03-10 15:25:51,I refuse to give any credit to trump. That vile man held super spreader events repeatedly throughout the worst spikes of the pandemic. He deserves nothing but scorn.

I suppose, if these ex-administration officials want some credit, they should also claim the additional lives lost due to their delays, denials, and inconsistent response to the pandemic. Their pathetic performance will be long remembered well after they're gone. Yes, ""Operation Warp Speed"" deserves some credit, but it isn't just in hindsight that it was deemed too late out of the gate, that treating the virus seriously instead of as simply a damper on the economy brought this sorry chapter of the American Presidency to a deserved end, and all the sycophants with it. Hopefully."
2021-03-10 15:33:45,Odd that the Trump camp forgets their refusing the extra 100 Million Pfizer doses that were offered last August solely because they were not a participant of Operation Warp Speed.

I love you. Now let's move on to our other projects !"""
2021-03-10 15:00:32,Are these the same people who came into office stating on how they “inherited” a bad economy. Maybe there is some truth that they laid the groundwork but their response to the pandemic was pathetic. They get no credit for getting people vaccinated.
2021-03-10 14:51:43,"To the very last minute, Trump would not allow his Covid team to interact with the Biden transition team. Progress that has been made in combatting the spread of the virus and developing the vaccine has all been IN SPITE OF and not because of Donald Trump. Journalists can't seem to get over their fixation with Trump but many Americans are ready to put his horrible administration behind us. His short attention span and irresponsibility played a huge role in the deaths of more than 500,000 Americans."
2021-03-10 15:11:02,"This point has surely been made before but No Credit is due the “proto-fascist” regime of the prior President (and I write that with all due respect to avoiding over-heated anti-scientific hyperbole). Because the Prior Administration destroyed America’s Covid response and led the country into the catastrophe. They destroyed not only policy scientific respect duty etc. but the fed. epidemiological infrastructure. No Credit. We could have tolerated slower rollout of vaccine if competence had prevailed in other areas. In fact the huge costs were caused by that crowd. And all those profits are going where? Yes Consumption and Global Warming. There is no free lunch, Virginia."
2021-03-10 15:36:29,"This column does not tell us anything we did not already know. No one wants to hear Trump's name, let alone give voice to some sort of ""who should get the credit?"" contest. The nation has PTSD from the previous administration. Please stop bringing him up."
2021-03-10 15:37:22,"TRUMP HELPED?  With such help who needs enemies?  I take Trump at his word.  His first public statements about the COVID-19 virus were to the effect that the virus was nothing--just like the flu.  And that it would disappear on its own.  Beyond that, he announced one day that we should drink chlorine bleach and shine ultraviolet inside our bodies because both kill the COVID-19 virus.  Then he dumped the decisions on the governors to deflect criticism away from himself, as he wanted to get the credit after the initial mindlessness and chaos.  Trump permitted price gouging among governors.  He showed off the monoclonal antibodies that he himself took.   Trump never acknowledged the record unemployment or the huge death toll.  He spent his days watching Fox news in the Oval Office, while an assistant cranked out his chronic tweets--many of which were incitement to violence.  And he is suspect of having known of and/or participated in the planning of the insurrection on 1/6/2021.  By contrast, Biden, who is capable of organizing and prioritizing, as he's the most experience president in US history, set very high goals and is reaching them. Oh yeah, Trump told Carl Bernstein that he KNEW that the COVID-19 virus was highly contagious, though he lied to We The People, trivializing its virulence. Trump refused to wear a mask and engage in social spacing, which Fauci said could have eliminated 98% of the cases of COVID-19. Trump was only able to lie, plan violence and an insurrection."
2021-03-10 14:57:00,Don’t you think this was a collective effort (actually over centuries by many) not the work of just two men?  It’s a social effort and should be properly called “socialism”.
2021-03-10 14:57:03,"A key difference between the Trump administration’s and the Biden administration’s involvement in vaccine rollout:

Donald Trump only cared about the vaccine to the extent it could help him get re-elected.  Mr. Biden actually wants to see lives saved.

(Mr. Trump’s personal engagement with the process would have been limited to a minute or two.  He’d have asked “how does this affect me.”  When told it could help him, he’d have said “OK.”  Then...back to tweeting, watching TV, and playing golf.)"
2021-03-10 15:42:01,"Trump's efforts were mixed, for all the reasons now well known -- diminishing the need for masks distancing, mixed messages on the level of health threat, uneven use of the DPA, blaming everyone but his admin for any failures, taking credit for everything that went well and taking no responsibility for failures. Had he tackled the covid crisis the way Biden is now, Trump would have won in a landslide. He is a defective individual fully responsible for his own undoing."
2021-03-10 15:18:21,"No credit is due Trump at all or at any time for anything other than his disruption of our democracy. 

He, and his administration, had no plans for vaccine distribution - all was left to the states to organize.   The promised second doses did not exist and this we learned after Biden's inauguration. 

It's shameful and journalisticly incompetent for the Times to even hint that Trump was in any way helpful for the distribution of the vaccine or for anything having to do with providing it to the public. 

Don't forget that Trump's role was to dismiss the pandemic and promise it would be gone like 'magic,' and then devote all his time to denouncing the validity of the election."
2021-03-10 15:07:17,"Yet another sore loser clinging to the Trump myth. Mr. Trump had all the time in the world to ramp up PPE production, develop appropriate guidelines, and support vaccine development and production. Instead he did none of that, the states and cities were left to scramble for themselves, and despite terrible national leadership, were somehow able to stay afloat. 

Biden inherited an unnecessarily devastating catastrophe, made the best of a bad situation, and implemented strategies that should have been deployed a year ago. But sure, give the credit to Trump, and keep burying your head in the sand. I'll continue living out here in reality with everybody else."
2021-03-10 15:17:05,Biden is not doing more than any competent person in good faith would do in his position.  Trump couldn't even meet that standard
2021-03-10 15:01:34,"Every statement on the Pandemic (including vaccines) is how inept the Trump administration was and how culpable they are to the greater than half a million deaths, most necessary."
2021-03-10 15:09:37,"We knew - and hoped - vaccines were coming. All the more reason to get behind promoting safety and discipline.
Instead we got armed protests, mocking masks and ignoring social distancing. Trump is probably the only figure who could have convinced a certain segment of America to be careful.
If he had done that he would have been reelected.
He failed miserably, almost criminally."
2021-03-10 15:09:19,"Any credit that is afforded the Trump administration vis a vis vaccine development must be viewed against the backdrop of the disgusting failure to deal with the pandemic as a whole.

Trump actions – and more precisely, his inactions – on Covid 19, his lies to the public, his politicization of mask wearing and social distancing ended up causing hundreds of thousands of American deaths, horrendous grief for millions more and the loss of jobs, homes and incomes for millions more.

Trump has yet to tell his cultists to mask up and roll up their sleeves.

Science, something that Trump disdained and his base treated as a hoax, developed the vaccines. And once developed, Trump and his administration completely botched the rollout.

Sorry, I give no credit to a ""leader"" who told Americans to drink bleach and inject themselves with Lysol as a solution to a pandemic that has claimed a half million and counting citizens their lives."
2021-03-10 14:53:19,All these objections from disgraced administration officials who allowed their boss to deliberately downplay the virus and freely admit it. They are quite disengenuous and easily dismissed.
2021-03-10 15:27:39,"trump made the mess to begin with, then largely failed to clean it up. the deadline should read “despite trumps help”"
2021-03-10 14:57:54,"From the reporting I read, the Trump administration said they had 100 million doses which turned out to be a lie. How did that help, states were planning on that supply?"
2021-03-10 15:07:41,"Enough of Trump and what he did and didn’t do! He deepened the COVID crisis and did absolute zero to mitigate it, denied science and created super spreader events, while flapping his lips about election fraud. 

As soon as the Biden Administration was allowed to operate they quietly started working around the clock. They took the remarkable achievements of biotechnology and ran with them. The never over promised, they never bragged, just delivered. This is the government I want to hear about and give credit to. As for the “former”- I want them to disappear. If they get indicted along the way to well deserved oblivion, so much  the better."
2021-03-10 15:04:54,"Trump can rightfully claim that he lied about COVID, suggested disinfectants as cures, and was responsible for the horrendous number of US COVID deaths because of his lying and abdication of duty."
2021-03-10 15:25:46,"Credit for development of the vaccines belongs to the pharmaceutical companies and the government-backed research that supported them. During the months when the vaccines were in development, the federal government could have been creating a national database for both scheduling and information sharing, working out the logistics that would be necessary once the vaccines were delivered, and trouble-shooting for efficiency. Instead, the Trump administration squandered precious time denying the severity of the problem, promoting false treatments, and discouraging responsible behaviors that could help mitigate the spread of the virus. Even when they had lost re-election, they refused to meet with the Biden transition team to make sure the handoff went smoothly. How can the NYTimes run a headline that claims Trump “helped” in any way? Any success has been despite Trump’s efforts, not because of them."
2021-03-10 15:28:19,"Nothing trump and his people did helped anyone do anything; in fact, when they saw that biden won, they purposefully sabotaged everything they could so biden would have an even more difficult time stopping the insanity and incompetence. 
It takes alot of nerve and bravado to claim they were helpful in any way. Biden and his team had to reinvent the wheel due to the criminal and purposeful negligence by trump and his minions. From the top down including dept. of state, labor, commerce, treasury etc. the leaders and their staffs tore apart as much as they could before biden took office and even denied them the transition money and time to insititute plans. For you to write otherwise is just wrong."
2021-03-10 15:14:22,"The Trump administration kick started vaccine production and it should be stated as such. But, Trump had no distribution plan and, in fact, wanted to punish blue states by withholding the vaccine. We would never be where we are without Biden's team.

Trump's incompetence and lies lead to to the spread of the pandemic and caused many lives to be lost and whatever acknowledgement is given with be done with with an asterisk."
2021-03-10 15:31:09,"Trump did nothing.  The SCIENTISTS did all the vaccine work.  Trump interfered all along the way, along with his ""staff."" 
Trump delayed the rollout by not having a plan to hand over to Biden. 
Hooray for the Biden team who started from scratch to roll out the vaccines in record time!  Biden's team ALSO got industry to produce the needed supporting materials.  Trump REFUSED to do this, again delaying the vaccine rollout.  Trump did not produce enough PPE and people, many people died."
2021-03-10 14:56:39,"Yes, let’s give Trump a lot of credit for the pandemic also. A virus he lied about. He knew it was a deadly virus, but yet said it was no worse than the flu. So yes, Trump gets the credit for the death of over 500,000 Americans when it could have possibly been limited to no more than 100,000. If he would have set an example of mask wearing, his followers (cult like that they are), most likely would have followed his example. Trump was more interested in the stock market than saving lives. It wasn’t Trump who got the vaccines out there, it was the science. Trump, with help from Kushner and Miller, came up with the name Warp Speed. That is his big claim to fame with covid 19. Let’s not give Trump credit where it isn’t due."
2021-03-10 15:30:30,"Trump gets zero credit for the vaccine rollout. He had no ""plan"", nothing. I also am certain he ordered only enough for red states and had he been reelected (the horror) that would have been the case. Blue states fighting over crumbs.

I'm certain vaccine distribution would have been mired down be is inept incompetency in the same we he ""lead"" PPE distribution.  He did everything in his power to see the virus rampage through the Country like wild fire. For that he gets all the credit."
2021-03-10 15:35:35,"Was all this the Trump Administration contributed before or after Trump tried to use his mobs to prevent the peaceful transfer of power.  Or does attempting to kill his own Vice President not factor into just about everything else this guy did?  But give Trump credit, he failed at that, too."
2021-03-10 15:08:00,"Once again, the headline and the article's substance are very different. The headline suggests the Trump and Biden admins deserve roughly equal credit.  The article seems to suggest that the Biden admin deservers far more credit.  While Trump invoked the DPA 18 times, it says, he refused to do so for heavy machinery necessary to ramp up production of a key vaccine.  And, what the article doesn't mention at all, the Trump admin utterly failed to put in place a rational distribution system.  Thank God we finally now have a competent administration."
2021-03-10 15:04:40,"Thank you is due to President Donald Trump. We are grateful though some can not bring themselves to say it, blinded by ideology as they are. Thank you, Sir, you have my vote in 2024."
2021-03-10 15:10:26,So what exactly was it that the Trump administration did? Did they even have a vaccination distribution plan or not?
2021-03-10 15:27:47,"Trump deserves little if any credit. Without any involvement on his part the vaccines would still have been developed. Had Trump responded to the pandemic like Biden has we would not have 500,000+ deaths. Trump opposed masks rather than advocating them as a necessary civic responsibility to curtail the pandemic. Against his own administration's advice, he held rallies that help spread the virus. He willfully fostered the false belief that the pandemic is fake news. Because Trump's lies have become Republican ideology, some states are ending all restrictions even though cases have plateaued at too high a level and more contagious variants are spreading. Trump continues to do far more damage than good."
2021-03-10 15:05:54,"Trump gleefully took credit numerous times for the booming economy, while downplaying the inherited momentum of the 8 years of recovery engineered by Obama-Biden; who had to pick up the pieces after the financial crash left to them by GW Bush. 

Its rich to have Trump’s staffers lament about Biden getting credit for the vaccine rollout when if they had just done a half decent mask endorsement we would have so many more people alive today."
2021-03-10 15:39:42,"honestly, Trumps reckless behavior, showcased by his maskless rallies, his dalliance with false cures, his undermining of the COVID threat, his sidelining of experts, and then finally, hiding his own vaccination, his quiet enabling of anti-vaccination zealots - how does that even compare with the Biden administrations ""adult in the room"" policies towards containment and now, a transparent and fully engaged rollout of the campaign to vaccinate Americans. Surely this is ""bothsideism"" gone totally wrong.

Anyone can throw taxpayer money at companies that promise scientific breakthroughs. If i recall, the Trump administration did not even consider Pfizer. Not blaming him for that, but the real kudos go to the scientists in this case, not Mr. Trumps overbloated ego."
2021-03-10 15:22:02,"Sure, give credit to Trump if you think he deserves any. But, there's no mistaking who gets blame--blame for deceiving the public about the virus, for downplaying it, for pretending it didn't exist and would miraculously disappear. Blame for having no plan for administering the vaccine, blame for denying, defunding and excoriating science and scientists. And most of all, blame for the half million deaths. All that blame goes to Donald Trump. When you decide to give credit to Trump, remember to credit him with those 500,000 deaths. Most of them occurred during his time in office because his administration failed the American people."
2021-03-10 15:15:11,Where Biden clearly succeeded and Trump failed tragically is in the distribution and administration of the vaccine. Trump did little to organize and put in place a plan to follow up on Warp Speed. And let's not forget the action Trump took to place Americans at greater risk of exposure.
2021-03-10 15:24:56,"Trump bungled pretty much every aspect of pandemic management. 

President Biden is straightening everything out. 

Trump placed large advance orders for the vaccines, but so did many other world leaders. Yes, Trump slapped a ""brand name"" on the US effort so he could try to take credit for it, but that was pretty much the only difference."
2021-03-10 15:40:59,"Even a broken clock is right twice a day.  Trump never woke up and said ""What can I do for the country?"" It was always ""What can I do to get the country to do for me?""  To paraphrase an old joke, he always said ""Let's not talk about me. Let's talk about YOU. Tell us how great YOU think I am."" I suspect there wasn't a single day in his life when he did anything but try  to glorify and enrich himself.  So many failed enterprises. So many people cheated. The country still exists, barely.  That's more than can be said for many of his ventures. So it wasn't the pandemic that cost him his job.  It was his approach to his job that produced catastrophe after disaster for the nation. We all could see it. It was just a matter of time before that beast would come back to lacerate him.  Thank goodness it happened just in time."
2021-03-10 15:41:52,"You know, given how often Trump blamed Obama for everything that went wrong in his administration and failed to acknowledge anything that the previous administration had passed on to his, I find it deeply ironic that Trump's people are now complaining that the Biden folks are being dismissive of their efforts."
2021-03-10 15:43:37,". . . and Trump inherited a good economy that was steadily digging itself out of the Great Recession that Obama inherited 8 years earlier. 

Trump squandered his national inheritance just like he squandered his personal inheritance. 

Of course some positive things occurred during Trump's term. But that doesn't erase the mountain of damage that Trump inflicted.  Even a broken clock is right twice a day."
2021-03-10 15:15:34,"It was Trump who made every governmental ""accomplishment"" personal. Trump is the only president in my memory (I've lived through every administration since Eisenhower) who put himself front and center in every press conference, speech, rally, or even payment of stimulus moneys. Biden apparently prefers keeping his ego off display. Nobody cares whether they are protected because of this president or that one; they just care about being protected."
2021-03-10 15:16:51,Seriously?  Trump's entire political tenure was about taking credit for other people's work.
2021-03-10 15:29:49,"Kinda reminds me of:

""Trump KEPT the economy humming with Obama's help"".

A new Presidents is hurt by some trends left by the previous President and helped by others.  It's just the nature of the presidency (and life, for that matter).  There are unusual aspects of this with Trump, however:

a. Trump's obsession with credit taking (grabbing).  Typical with someone of his low character.

b. Obama was PUNISHED badly if he even hinted at the difficulty that Bush's wounded economy caused him.  On the other hand, Trump yelled that type of complaining from the tree tops... manufacturing most of it... and he got LESS criticism for that then Obama got for his minimal complaining."
2021-03-10 15:23:23,"Trump’s help ?
What help the author suggests I wonder.
Because of Trump’s denying when the virus started is the reason this country had so many affected. So many deaths which needn’t happen.
Trump  said before you know it is going to disappear .

It is President Biden  from the beginning started to speed up the production and his approval of scientific research..

Please give where the credit is due, Trump never even acknowledged Biden’s Presidency and still trying with his cronies to provide obstacles any progress Biden is making."
2021-03-10 14:59:43,"The “key elements” were not in place when the Biden administration took office. In fact, they found the opposite. Trump’s people had not used the DOA, had not ordered sufficient vaccines, and left the states to fend for themselves. It was a mess. All credit here to Biden, none to the former guy."
2021-03-10 15:39:42,"I still have, now framed on my wall, a postcard mailed from President Trump a year ago April with advice on fighting the pandemic. Not a word about wearing masks or social distancing. The best advice they could give was  to try and avoid large gatherings. That's Trump's legacy in all this (not to mention, more recently, early December 2020, the army commander he put in charge of distribution, facing criticism of slow progress, admitted they were completely unprepared for the task, after almost a full year to prepare, darn)."
2021-03-10 15:27:26,"What a truly odd article and headline. Is this the new norm for news? Didn't see similar when Trump and his administration were actually, factually, all out attacking prior presidents at every turn, and taking credit for their achievements to burnish his spotlight and garner applause, the economy for one. Nor did I see any free PR for former presidents and their aides. A new era?

""To Trump administration aides, the new president’s crowing rings off-key.""   

As if anyone around Trump would understand what off-key or crowing means having twisted it into an acceptable norm (with help from the media), and habituated themselves and fans to its whining, blaming, dangerous sounds and tone during his tenure."
2021-03-10 15:36:32,"Leave it to Republicans to claim the credit. On a Sunday talk show, one of the Republican Senate leaders referred to the success as part of Operation Warp Speed. Except for this Star Trek term Trump sat on his hands and just fixated on the ""election fraud"" from November thru January 6th. How long before the Republicans take all credit for the latest relief bill?"
2021-03-10 15:04:48,"I think I missed the part of your editorial where Trump deserves some credit.  Pushing for a vaccine during a pandemic would be like FDR saying on Dec. 8th, let's build some weapons.  I'm sorry, but doing some things but not enough, is hardly praiseworthy."
2021-03-10 15:34:00,"Any possible good that might have come from the former guy and his administration is far outweighed by the overall calamity of his disastrous handling of COVID-19.

The real question to be asked here is, how many hundreds of thousands of lives might have been saved had a competent president and administration been in place at the onset of this pandemic?

Rather than seek out and celebrate the silver lining in this case, it would be far more instructive for us to learn from what made the storm so much worse than it ever needed to be in the first place, and then do whatever it takes to prevent similar circumstances from ever happening again."
2021-03-10 15:03:05,"The problem with anything that might be called Trump administration achievements is that there could never be any certainty he would remain committed to seeing them through. Daily lying and erratic changes of course in response to the cable news cycle made Trump's a government by opportunistic whim at the top, even if the bureaucracy beneath were chugging away more substantially beyond public scrutiny and certainty. In the case of vaccine production, its success under Trump looks very much due to his considering it his one-and-done, after his initial mostly smoke and mirrors ban on Chinese travel which he trumpeted ad nauseam while denying the danger of the virus. It looks like a success of malign neglect, aided in part by Trump likely viewing it as lavishing government billions on Big Pharma, boosting their stocks and the market. Any credit for its success goes to those in his administration who worked toward it, not to Trump."
2021-03-10 15:05:10,"Even if I grant some credit to the few professionals who managed to hang on in Trump's administration, there is no credit that should be given to Trump.  He did nothing other than fuel skepticism of the virus and make life harder for the people trying to save lives."

2021-03-10 15:05:57,What is the intent of this article?  It seems designed to curtail enthusiasm for Biden's successes while giving due credit to Trump.  Yet the facts presented in the article support the Biden perspective.  What particular results did the Trump team achieve from invoking the Defense Production Act 18 times?  These actions did not appear to be manifesting itself in sufficient supply or timely distribution during the six weeks that the Trump Administration was in charge of the vaccine rollout.
2021-03-10 15:12:38,This is an example of how men must always compete rather than collaborate or cooperate.
2021-03-10 15:39:54,"The COVID deaths of hundreds of thousands of Americans that occurred during the last year of the former guy’s Presidency more than offset whatever credit the former guy and his team think they deserve for the rapid development of COVID vaccines. The former guy downplayed the public health threat of COVID, claiming it was a hoax. He denied responsibility for a coordinated national response to the COVID pandemic. He made it clear that the governors of each state were responsible for responding to the pandemic in their respective states. In fact, the former guy encouraged his supporters not let COVID dominate their lives and to oppose the public health policies designed to hinder the spread of the disease."
2021-03-10 14:55:35,"Kudos to Trump and his administration for allowing the pandemic to spread with devastating  consequences for the public, and then claim credit for controlling it. Oh, while we are at it let's thank the arsonist who started the inferno for calling the fire department to extinguish what the arsonist ignited."
2021-03-10 15:22:44,The difference is that whatever the Trump Administration did for the vaccine rollout was hidden from the public while what the Biden Administration did for the vaccine rollout was out in the open.
2021-03-10 15:12:41,"At the end of the day, one president talked a good game which resulted in some solid hits while the other president delivered not just a home run, but multiple grand slams.

Isn't it time to focus forward instead of fixating on the monumental mistakes from the past presidency?  Learning from errors in judgments is a solid remedy in not repeating similar actions.  

While I realize that over 520K lives were lost because of reckless, irresponsible and deception regarding this virus, I believe in focusing on the hope these vaccines will prove to be for millions and millions in this country and the entire world.

The ""vaccine rollout is humming"".  THAT is the story.  Period."
2021-03-10 15:08:45,"The technological innovations took a long time coming. To my understanding, they were part of a disaster management program of previous administrations that was discontinued by Trump. The CDC was ill-prepared and not calibrated to the demands. Expert knowledge wasn’t sought. The ball got rolling late. That said, the reemergence of vaccine technology was brilliant but thanks Mr Trump for getting out of the way, only to sew doubt later."
2021-03-10 15:03:47,I believe any sane and rational person who was alive and living in North America for the past four years knows exactly where credit is due for pandemic recovery.￼
2021-03-10 12:41:30,"I suppose that the NYT is attempting to be balanced , but there’s really no need. Trump and his Administration have crowed and gloated and tried to grab so  much credit for his non-program that it’s astonishing.  When I read that his Administration officials accused Pfizer of slow walking vaccine development for political purposes it reinforced one thing: All Republicans see everything through the lens of political advantage or disadvantage."
2021-03-10 13:49:34,"The Trump so-called administration - like Putin - loves alternative facts about nearly everything. 

Since the pandemic began, on an hourly and daily basis, they let a health crisis completely wash over the US, undermining competent public health professionals and medical science every step of the way. They asserted that testing ""only increases our numbers of cases and makes us look bad"", and underfunded testing and PPE. They insisted on the use of quackery such as hydroxychloroquine (""what have you got to lose?""), injecting disinfectants, and propagated the lie that ""it will go away when the weather is warmer"". They obfuscated at every step, lied to the American people, and we now have over 500,000 dead Americans as the score card of their handy work.

Now they whine that they should get full credit for the vaccine success Biden is driving, citing Warp Speed, yet they conveniently forget to state that Pfizer NEVER received govt $ for vaccine development. Not one cent.

Let the balatrons whine. Who cares. They managed do do 1 useful thing in the whole pandemic - while allowing death to wash across our nation.  I hope Trump and his crew are held liable in a modern day Nuremberg-like criminal court for their direct actions and the consequences. This way they will get all the credit they truly deserve."
2021-03-10 15:23:10,"Thanks, NYT, for attempting to set the record straight as to credit due to the Trump and Biden administrations.

Notwithstanding, perception is in the eye of the beholder. 

From here, the Trump administration looks woefully inept at vaccine distribution, handing it off to states after Warp Speed development.

Trumpers' whining now about not being given ""credit"" is so typical of them. Yawn."
2021-03-10 13:04:51,"Strange reporting. It would seem that if you are going to give Mr. Trump credit for the vaccinations, shouldn't you also mention his blame for the deaths of 500,000 Americans as he promoted the idea that Covid is a myth?"
2021-03-10 13:57:39,"Hmmmmm, I seem to recall Trump taking credit for the growing stock market and healthy economy that Obama left him!"
2021-03-10 15:12:37,"Are we forgetting how Trump failed to secure the additional 100 million doses of Pfizer/BioNTech, when it was offered to him. (<a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/07/us/trump-covid-vaccine-pfizer.html"" target=""_blank"">https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/07/us/trump-covid-vaccine-pfizer.html</a>) He refused the add’l doses, and they went to other countries. That was a Bill Buckner-esque moment that set us back months in vaccination. It was the Biden administration that saved the day by putting together the J&J/Merck deal, which he does not get nearly enough credit for. It is widely believed that Trump refused those doses because Pfizer did not participate in his “Operation Warp Speed,” and he wanted one of “his” vaccines to play a big role. As usual, his ego picked self-aggrandizement over helping his people. You are so mistaken in giving Trump any credit."
2021-03-10 15:50:36,"This headline is very misleading.   The Trump administration used corporate socialism (go make a vaccine and we will make sure you get paid whether you are successful or not) to get us to this point.   Russia had a working vaccine in the same time frame,  and I doubt that they are handing out cash to the vaccine inventors or manufacturers.   So how can Trump etc claim credit?"
2021-03-10 15:56:32,"It goes without saying that some people during the last year of the Trump administration were doing useful things for which we should be grateful. But the relevant question is, what did Trump himself do to further the effort other than sign things that were put in front of him?  Did he take the problem seriously? Did he compare and contrast alternative proposals and make wise decisions? Certainly not.  Nothing that Trump has ever done suggests that he is capable of objective evaluation of a complex task that has nothing to do with his private interests."

Trump and his cronies were inept and played favorites. Red states would be favored. Trump would make a game of it. I thank our lucky stars that we have a leader leading us, not a petulant child."
2021-03-10 15:47:36,An incoming president taking credit for the previous president's work?  Shocking!  Never seen that before.
2021-03-10 15:49:16,"He dismantled the system that was in place in China to pick up early warning signs of any possible outbreak of disease.

He downplayed it from the beginning and predicted it was just going to go away.

He gave supplies we needed to China.

He didn’t move to get supply production going, even ignoring a mask manufacturer who offered to help. 

He undercut medical professionals, downplayed the importance of safe practices to appear “tough”, got his vaccine on the sly so he wouldn’t appear to buying all that propaganda.

And now we are supposed to give him credit. Lipstick on a pig."
2021-03-10 15:47:55,Politicians who already received the Pfizer or Moderna vacines advocate for the significantly less effective Johnson & Johnson vaccine for other people.  They think it's good enough for the general population now that politicians and leading medical experts are better protected with Pfizer or Moderna.
2021-03-10 15:46:19,"As long as we give Trump credit for all the lies around Covid-19 and his failure to support basic protections such as mask wearing, social distancing, and not gathering in groups great than 10, his administration deserves credit for getting the vaccine going. My understanding, however, using the mRNA method to develop the vaccines cut significant time off the process and had nothing to do with ""treat it with bleach"" non-science (aka nonsense) Trump."
2021-03-10 15:50:51,"I believe that we are all willing to give credit where credit is due—but, President Trump dismantled the pandemic team in December 0f 2018 as reported in this newspaper. Perhaps, much of this crisis could have been avoided had that team been in place—in much the same way as H1N1 was headed off and Ebola.

Look at the contrast in the timing of getting the vaccine out in other countries, and even between states. How many different ways had been thought of to promote getting vaccines in arms by Biden's team?—opening up places like the United Center in Chicago, or Dodger Stadium in LA, or the Convention Center in Philly. Even going into the Jewel/Osco, and pharmacies.

I'm going to applaud  Biden who had a bunch of really savvy folks who had a lot of creative thought. He's the real deal."
2021-03-10 15:49:59,"Yes the vaccine is a gamechanger. Who knows if Trump's bellicose Tweeting caused it to arrive any sooner. But the vaccine is worthless unless it can be administered. And if Trump were still president we'd still be in a terrible mess. He had NO effective plan for getting the vaccines into the arms of Americans beyond shipping it to the states, blaming them for the chaos that ensued and then lying about the problem. And we probably would have a lot more refusal to take a Trump vaccine due to his years of lying and gaslighting the public.

Mr Trump's governing ""style"" -- if you call barking orders at incompetent political hacks and Tweeting a governing approach -- doomed his administration's efforts to failure.  

And he STILL refuses to help solve a problem he did so much to create. He was vaccinated in secret! He refuses to tell Republicans to get the vaccine or wear a mask - even after 500,000 dead. 

If you want to give credit where credit it due - include the entire story."
2021-03-10 15:47:36,"Yeah. Let's just forget all about the precious time Trump wasted playing down the seriousness of the pandemic, blaming the Chinese, leaving individual states 'on their own' and criticizing and threatening 'blue' states for actions taken by local governments rather than using his presidential powers right away to mobilize the nation's resources to fight the war against Covid. As usual, Republicans are whining. Par for the Trump Course."
2021-03-10 15:59:59,"Trump deserves credit for pushing, with financial incentives, vaccine manufacturers to rush the discovery and trial of vaccines. He deserves considerable blame for belittling the virus and the value of masking. His halting on November 3 of any involvement in the distribution of vaccines is nothing less than criminal.There are statutes for dereliction of duty. While Biden has surely recognized the magnitude of the problem and has improved manufacture and distribution no one should be lulled into thinking we are in a promising place with this continuing pandemic. Only 10% of Americans have been fully vaccinated, many citizens still cannot get appointments, there is still not a coherent policy from the CDC and states are not on the same page. People continue to die. The longer it takes for the nation to be fully vaccinated or reach herd immunity the greater the risk of variants, transmission and vaccine resistance."
2021-03-10 15:54:11,"OK, blind squirrel finds nut, Trump did the obvious by supporting vaccine makes' effort by financing their efforts with taxpayer dollars. Credit where credit it due, though arguably any president would have done the same WITHOUT the inexcusable things that Trump did that condemned us to leading the world in cases and deaths. And yes, Biden was fortunate to be able to ride the wave of progress, But credit goes to the scientists who have revolutionized the process of creating the vaccines."
2021-03-10 15:59:38,"Neither Trump nor Biden had any personal work in researching, testing or administering the vaccines. That's not their role. Their roles were about leadership. Trump denied it's existence, made outlandish promises and speculations, undercut experts and left the states to figure out piecemeal solutions. His impact is less than zero. 

That said, to give Trump credit for the work performed by the Biden administration in clearing logistical hurdles is like giving the person who supplied the canvas equal credit for painting the Mona Lisa. 

This is kind of the opposite of how Trump handled the economy. All the good work the Obama administration did in fixing the 2008 collapse led to the trajectory of the first 3 Trump years. But his wrongheaded tax cuts for the wealthy will now handicap the Biden administration's ability to bounce back from the Trump bungling."
2021-03-10 15:54:43,"The fairness doctrine at work. Trump could not have been as awful as he seemed, Biden can't be as excellent as he seems. It just seems that way because the media wants to make up a story. This is the true media bias."
2021-03-10 16:02:53,"In my mind, Trump will always be the main accelerant of the pandemic in the U.S.

For months he contradicted medical authorities and lied to his worshipers that:

> the virus was like the flu 
> it would go away, ""like a miracle""
> most would get over it easily
> weird treatments (bleach?) would fix it
> masks were for wimps
> it was OK to sponsor super spreader events 

He led the U.S. to become the #1 global hotspot in the outbreak."

The revelation, first reported by the New York Times and confirmed to the Associated Press on Monday, Mon 7 Dec 2020, came a day before Donald Trump aimed to take credit for the speedy development of forthcoming vaccines at a White House summit."
2021-03-10 15:16:03,"Inadequate, short-sighted, chaotic, corrupt.

Trump and the Republican Party were dragged, kicking and screaming, to do the absolute minimum they had to do to keep from losing worse than they did in the 2020 general election.

They resisted doing anything.

Their goal was herd immunity achieved without a vaccine.

That's the second-largest reason they lost.

The biggest reason they lost was that Donald Trump was at the top of the ticket."

They took credit for an economic recovery that developed during the Obama administration and undermined it with tax cuts and other goodies for the already obscenely wealthy while pretending to care for working class people. Trumps business model has been built on claiming credit for other peoples work while cheating everyone down the financial food chain from him. That his administration should emulate his philosophy of mendacity and rapacity after the fact is unsurprising, after all its the republican way."
2021-03-10 15:41:51,"Are you kidding me?  Trumpers deserve CREDIT?  The mere fact that they refused for months to invoke the Defense Production Act proves they IMPEDED progress that could have saved lives.
Not to mention discouraging mask wearing, have no workable distribution plan, botching increased production contracts and discrediting science.
How many lives is Trump responsible for ending?
Shameful article."
2021-03-10 13:34:06,"Never forget that #45 ALSO deserves FULL credit for deepening the severity of the pandemic, by inaction during almost all of Feb 2000,and by actively discouraging the use of masks and social distancing, and by encouraging and inciting attacks on state legislators.

The 2/2000 delay alone was estimated to have cost 37,000 lives. 

In the end, #45 also deserves FULL CREDIT for the additional hundreds of thousands of people who died because of the confusion he intentionally sowed.

#45 is, therefore, a fully credited mass murderer."

And to be fair, Trump so mishandled the public information and perception campaign about the raging virus that US deaths are off the charts.  To me, at least 300,000 more than they had to be if he would have not treated the entire pandemic and fallout as a step in political war.

Remember Tulsa.
Remember Mount Rushmore.
Remember the ""Open Our States Up"" near riots.
Remember Sturges.
Remember the Republican Convention.
Remember the bleach and Lysol.
Remember the Rose Garden Super Spreader Event.
Remember his ""Save America"" attack the Capitol Insurrection.

really? how did trump help, exactly? roll up his sleeves? put on his red cap and grab the nearest shovel? break a sweat and ask for water? trump: the bulk protoplasm. what, what did he do?

see, my misinformed conception is that trump did little to nothing that was not obstruction and denial; responsibility was picked up by underlings, by professionals, who had the unhappy job of fighting a pandemic and fighting political resistance to their fight against a pandemic.

some responsibility was passed to VP pence, but his great mark in life is to write editorials stating that the pandemic is a fraud and voter fraud is a pandemic.

""trump administration officials grumble."" oh, poor babies. poor little boys and girls. 

if you'd grumbled a bit louder and more insistently, if you'd stood up to the political pressure and forced home every inch of your charter, portfolio and administrative powers, perhaps we'd be in a different place then we are now.

Let’s talk a little about global responsibility. Why is it that the United States, which arguably has done less than almost any other nation to curb the spread of Covid-19, enjoying unhindered supply of the vaccine? Why are we in Europe (I’m an American residing in Italy) and the rest of the world, rich and poor, struggling to obtain vaccines, with companies delivering mere fractions of the promised vials? Astra-Zeneca has delivered only 10% of promised vaccines to Europe so far, Pfizer is woefully behind, Moderna essentially only supplies the US, while J&J appears geared largely toward US supply, though European approval is slated for next week. Granted the US provided funds for vaccine development to Moderna, but funds for Pfizer and other companies were in the form of an advance-purchase agreements, which Europe also made.
Trump forbade the export of vaccines before everyone (willing and of appropriate age) in the US had been fully vaccinated, and the NYT reports that Biden has been even more restrictive. So, hey, NYT, why don’t you report about this criminally selfish, isolationist, America-first behavior? We all hope America, the (blatantly hypocritical) world ""watchdog and savior"" will also stay out of world politics on other fronts, given this latest revelation of its true immoral, irresponsible nature.

2021-03-10 15:50:57,typical politics from both sides - this is America?  watch the decline
2021-03-10 15:39:32,"Your headline is misleading. The article makes clear that a few people on Trump's team made a strong start on vaccine production, but three quarters of the article is about what Biden and his people have achieved in both production and distribution from the election onward."
2021-03-10 15:41:23,You can feel the author trying so hard to give as little credit as possible to Trump but at the same time knowing that it’s deserved and that Biden is the benefactor of the foundation Trump laid.   As if cancellation is looming over the authors head.
2021-03-10 13:13:15,"Trump's response to COVID was to mock masks, ridicule science, botch the rollout, downplay the virus, do a PR joy ride from the hospital then pretend COVID wasn't deadly by thumping his chest at the WH when returning from the hospital.

I don't understand this need to falsely equate the two President's response to the pandemic.  It's actually shameful, and it enables a demented, grifting ex-president and a corrupt Republican party."
2021-03-10 12:07:29,"With Trump's help in the sense that Trump ignored the virus and made the US an outlier of contagion and death, thus terrifying the reasonable citizens such that they diligently sought vaccination while Trump's cultishly moronic followers refused to follow basic public health guidelines and also advocate against basic science and the vaccine? Thank you, Trump."
2021-03-10 15:51:25,"Your headline is way off. It should read Biden Overcomes Trump’s Childish Petulance to Manufacture and Deliver Vaccines. Subtitle, “Adults Are In Charge”.  Biden does need to figure out the border problem and fast or he will lose the House and the mean and nasty children will rule again. Critically important."
2021-03-10 14:57:33,Trump killed thousands of people by ignoring the pandemic and not wearing a mask.  He is responsible for the greatest mass killing of Americans in history so please don't give him credit for this.  It is insulting to the memory of the thousands who lost their lives because of him.
2021-03-10 13:49:55,"In your attempt to appear like you are looking at both sides equally, The NY Times' omits a lot of facts here. 

Yes, the Trump Administration deserves some credit (some) for an initial speedy development of some of the vaccines. Other than that, their handling of the vaccine rollout was a disaster. 

How can you omit the fact that the Trump administration opted not to purchase 250 million additional doses of the Pfizer vaccine early on?

How can you ignore that in the two months after the election Trump refused to share any information with the incoming administration?

The word ""States"" is not in this article (save for United States). How can you ignore that Trump's decision to leave administering the vaccine to the states led to significantly fewer shots actually getting into arms ?

Trump and Melania took the vaccine and actually opted not to tell their supporters that fact! Can you imagine what that information would have done to motivate his supporters to get vaccinated.

How does the word ""masks"" not appear in this article?

This is not objective - this is irresponsible."
2021-03-10 11:36:55,"Among his crimes, Trump is also guilty of involuntary manslaughter."
2021-03-10 13:27:36,"When Biden’s people took over 6 weeks ago, they were surprised to find that there were no plans for vaccine distribution!

Imagine what would have happened if Trump were reelected!  The vaccination campaign would be chaotic, with states bidding against each other for limited supplies.
Trump would be giving mixed messages about whether the vaccines were any good, and refusing to wear a mask.
If Trump had been reelected, a million more Americans would die before herd immunity is achieved.

Thankfully we have President Biden, who has hired the experts to do the job, unlike Trump hiring his family and incompetent toadies."
2021-03-10 12:16:27,I’m sorry but carelessly stating “it will just go away” immediately disqualifies Trump from ever claiming a smidge of credit.
2021-03-10 16:04:22,I thought we only gave participation awards to kids’ sports teams? I guess the previous Administration has about that much maturity...
2021-03-10 16:18:12,"For a guy who, admittingly, downplayed the severity of the virus, i find it interesting that he now was his credit for the rollout of a vaccine. It seems Trump is scrambling to find any sort of positivity in his flawed term with little or no success beyond his golf game. Sad!"
2021-03-10 16:23:27,"I think the article is being playful.  It's bringing up Trump admins' whining about not getting credit by tossing them a bone of fairness while allowing the absolute torrent comments from people who saw and experienced Trump's Admin in real life to make the context more complete.

Thank you to the few people with honorable intentions and competence who did their best dealing with the swamp that was the Trump Administration.  You did your job.  Which is what we expect from our taxpayer dollars."
2021-03-10 16:13:01,Does it really matter what Trump did in the face of 500K deaths in large part because of his inaction? Sorry but no. Let's not try to 'both sides' this
2021-03-10 16:18:23,"""Administration officials"" may have thought they were making great progress, but Trump had a habit of subverting it. Like secretly getting a vaccine."
2021-03-10 16:01:46,"I'm no fan of Trump or his administration, but give credit, where credit is due. The big difference is that Trump only segued to the vaccine when reality overwhelmed his ""hoax"" narrative. Imagine where we might be had he not been so uniformed, uneducated and uninterested in what was truly happening, and taken charge from the very beginning."
2021-03-10 16:23:38,"Go back to the gop primary debates when Trump and Carson floated the falsehood that vaccines cause autism or fast forward to his 2020 rallies where he belittled covid, the pandemic and public health measures. You can have all the vacccines you need but when the highest level of leadership sows doubt and division in the public it can undercut the process. At the very least the Biden administration has quieted the division, stopped mocking medical expertise, and stepped up production. He inherited a chaotic 50-state pandemic response that was well in play when he arrived. If Trump had been re-elected we would look a lot more like Brazil."
2021-03-10 16:19:43,"This is a well balanced article and intellectually honest readers - not rabid partisans - will understand the contributions of both administrations in the development, vetting, and distribution of these needed vaccines."
2021-03-10 15:47:21,"‘“They criticize what we did, but they are using our playbook every step of the way,” said Paul Mango, the Trump administration’s deputy chief of staff for health policy..”’
Citing Paul Mango—who lobbied intensely AGAINST vaccine funding for states—is a hell of a choice."
2021-03-10 16:16:48,"Pfizer has said very publicly that they did not take a single penny from the Warp Speed initiative.  They and their partners were working on a vaccine back in January 2020, long before Trump even acknowledged “something” was happening.  No PPE? Trump could have fixed that, but he chose not to.  Slow the spread by wearing a mask?  Trump mocked masks. Imagine if he had admitted that the best medical minds recommended wearing a mask and then did so himself.  The death toll would have been far less than 500,000.  So no, I don’t think the Trump administration deserves any credit. What little they did, they did grudgingly. And we still have those who refuse to wear masks and will refuse the vaccine thanks to him."
2021-03-10 16:05:59,"Trump is like the arsonist that sets a fire and then takes credit for calling the fire department. Early action would have greatly reduced the number of deaths, and having an early pandemic response team still in place wouldn’t have hurt either."
2021-03-10 15:55:59,Under promise and over deliver.  The exact opposite of what we saw from the previous administration.  That mindset leads to true success!
2021-03-10 15:46:13,"The Former Guy only gets credit for denying that the coronavirus was a profound threat, politicizing the government’s response to the pandemic, refusing to endorse the efficacy of wearing masks in public, interfering with medical and scientific expert’s advice on how to contain the pandemic, and eviscerating the CDC and other government agencies responsible for public guidance in response to the pandemic. Oh, he also gets credit for 500,000 American deaths."
2021-03-10 15:47:03,"I wouldn't give Trump a drop of credit, as he empowered the following self-serving tactics while the virus raged across the world.

Business Insider, May 6, 2020, Ashley Colman wrote:

When the US coronavirus outbreak began, there were concerns about healthcare workers getting the protective gear they needed.

So the senior White House adviser Jared Kushner, the son-in-law of President Donald Trump, formed a group of volunteers to sort through hundreds of leads on personal protective equipment and funnel the most promising ones to the Federal Emergency Management Agency, which is in charge of distributing supplies to states and medical workers.

But according to a new report by The New York Times, the volunteers were in fact prioritizing tips from close Trump associates, resulting in multiple botched deals.

Trump has been self-serving since he learned to walk and talk."
2021-03-10 16:24:12,"In addition to giving credit to Trump on vaccines, give discredit to him on the spread of the virus. He provided no leadership whatsoever in organizing PPE or ventilators snd other equipment. He provided negative leadership: dissing public health measures -masks and restrictions on behavior that exacerbated the spreading of the disease. He provided negative leadership with misinformation and anti science rhetoric. Biden inherited all that and a country weakened by disease deaths and public distrust of facts snd common sense. Let us not forget to give discredit where discredit is due."
2021-03-10 16:00:09,"Just because there were still people in government who knew what they were doing (yes, that Daep State) while Trump sat on his throne like an overgrown child at his own birthday party, doesn't mean Trump should get credit for their accomplishments. He did everything he could to cripple government, turn it into a patronage-fest and a personal profit center. In spite of that, our core government wheels still managed to do keep turning."
2021-03-10 16:30:05,"This sounds like a fair assessment of what occurred and what was missing. It would be extremely nice for Biden to offer the same assessment, clearly stating what was done before that helped start and what more his administration has done and is continuing to do.  This would demonstrate honesty--full story-- as well as showing that he is not one-sided, not only critical, and giving whatever credit is due. A small healing gesture. If he wants to make it more ""political"" but actually it would be more enlightening as well, he could also discuss what wasn't done before that could or should have been done, but that could take away the ""healing"" aspect even if it were the whole story.  The former guy's spokespeople could do the same; however that is surely not ever going to happen."
2021-03-10 16:26:53,"The blood of over 500,00 Americans is on the former guy's head. He cared only about reelection.."
2021-03-10 11:41:51,Trump could have had all the credit and probably a second term if he weren't so incompetent and self-serving.
2021-03-10 16:24:23,"Other than the Trump administration putting some early pressure on production your article reads more like since then Biden was able to achieve what he has be overcoming obstacles created by Trumps self defeating behavior. headline should be ""Biden succeeded despite Trump administrations efforts to screw up"""
2021-03-10 14:55:10,Does trump deserve credit when he was dragged kicking and screaming to do it?
2021-03-10 16:34:36,"Vaccine production is, by and large, not done by the government. It is performed by private industry. It's important that both the public and the media realize this.

Of course the government plays a role. Much of the basic research is funded by the government. The safety of vaccines is assured by the FDA. Policy for vaccine eligibility is set by governments, at both the state and the federal level. Some of the logistics involved in vaccine distribution are facilitated by the government. And, in a few cases the Defense Production Act was useful in reallocating manufacturing resources.

Both administrations deserve credit. Though globalization and the shutdown of American manufacturing was a major hindrance, this country is now doing well.

But it is private companies that are making the vaccines.  Today, US private pharmaceutical companies face an existential threat: trial lawyers and this country's out of control liability laws.

For example, Johnson & Johnnson today faces literally tens of thousands of multi-billion dollar lawsuits, most likely based on junk science, and the sympathy of lay jurors. In most cases, the company is not at fault. These lawsuits threaten the existence of J&J, and divert resources from vaccine production.

Vaccine production nearly ended in the US due to lawsuits, only a last minute no-fault law passed by Congress in 1986, The National  Vaccine Injury Act saved the day. 

Today, there is again an urgent need for Congress to pass tort reform."
2021-03-10 16:40:24,"I am puzzled that this report excludes the very important element of federal government support for actual vaccinations. My understanding is that the last admin provided little assistance to the states, and that this admin has provided much more. So there is more to the story than the numbers of doses. Numbers only count when gotten into the arms of citizens."
2021-03-10 17:09:59,"Do we really think the scientists weren't already working at ""warp speed"" before the former guy (TFG) made all the noise about ""his project""? I think not. In fact, some vaccine producers were not part of the project and they produced a vaccine in about the same time. The fact that TFG was so off the wall about ""cures"" and that the virus was a ""hoax"" made people understandably skeptical about the vaccine. If TFG had promoted all the ways to stay safe, maybe we could give him some credit. But he didn't earn it. And Warp Speed had no idea of how to actually vaccinate the population, an important part of the whole process."
2021-03-10 16:45:58,"Biden's White House might have been more charitable toward the Trump administration, if the Republican administration had not blamed the Democrats, and specifically Obama, for everything that  they could think of for four years, and had not undermined the legitimacy of the Biden administration itself."
2021-03-10 17:20:55,"It's Management 101 - Under-promise and over-deliver.  The former guy never learned that.

Also, this article focuses on production, but equally important has been the Biden Administration's focus on getting the vaccine administered.  The former guy was all about doing the deal to buy the doses; after that, he lost interest."
2021-03-10 16:37:21,"Credit? Hmmm okay, I call it doing your job. I guess I should get credit for feeding my child also! Hooray for me!"
2021-03-10 16:59:41,"Trump and a far right republican(trump) party called covid a hoax, forced states to fight a bidding war when thousands were dying every day in new york and new jersey in march-april 2020, disrupted lockdowns-with armed protestors, declared 'mission accomplished' early last year, when the covid case rates were exponentially rising and new variants were appearing, pushed fake 'cures', incited unrest on the streets following the George Floyd murder-worsening covid, held election rallies, often without masks, and finally Trump,his family members,and aides got sick.They also dissolved the pandemic unit. They ended lockdowns prematurely,and pressured states to end lockdowns, and 6000 a day died in winter. Trump and republicans refused to wear masks and are still ending mask mandates and lockdowns too early. Trump is crazy and the end result is that he is responsible for 525,000 deaths and 30 million cases.
Response to a pandemic goes far beyond producing vaccines.Trump miserably failed and Abbott and republicans in Texas are miserably failing.
Nothing that Trump and the GOP did is of any comfort to the families that lost 525,000. Most of those deaths were preventable. Nobody knows how many thousands,tens of thosands,or 100s of thousands were murdered by Trump and republicans refusing to wear masks and distance.
Alameda county moved into the red tier yesterday after cases dropped to 6 out of 100,000 for 2 weeks, although fewer people could be getting tested."
2021-03-10 17:19:58,"Its called managing expectations, a basic executive skill."
2021-03-10 16:36:03,"Sorry to extinguish your enthusiasm over Trump’s glorious achievements, but I can’t buy the attitude that it is President Biden who lowered the expectations concerning vaccine distribution."
2021-03-10 16:48:26,"It is beyond ""rich"" for the Trump administration to complain about not being given credit for the work they did given that they spent four years not only discrediting, but dismantling working systems they inherited from the Obama administration. Had the Trump people not obliterated the early warning and rapid response systems that were in place under Obama this pandemic might not have become the nightmare it is."
2021-03-10 17:04:49,"Oh please, let's not start rewriting history this early. If anything, trump actually sabotaged efforts to contain the virus. 

He downplayed the threat, called it a hoax. He criticized mask wearing. He held maskless mass rallies. He told the states they were on their own, that the feds were not a ""delivery service"". He promoted worthless, even dangerous ""cures"". He denigrated and contradicted Dr. Fauci. He criticized governors who put sensible mitigation measures in place. 

We have 2% of the world's population and 25% of the deaths, that's what trump ""accomplished"". 

There may have been responsible adults in the administration that helped, but trump is not one of them."
2021-03-10 16:40:16,"If Trump did anything meaningful to promote the production of a vaccine it was only because he thought he could make money from it. All his other behaviors were antithetical to the successful management of this pandemic, including his constant distortion of the facts. Somebody who repeatedly proclaimed the virus to be a hoax cannot in good conscience be given credit for helpful actions."
2021-03-10 16:43:17,"Trump laid the groundwork but failed to protect Americans on the front end by failing to enforce his own WH guidelines and claiming that those who chose to not wear a mask were just exercising “freedom”.   When given the PR opportunity to take the vaccine (by his account of his own making) to demonstrate its safety, Trump chose to get it in secret before he left the WH.
I can’t imagine why except perhaps he construed it to be a sign of weakness to his base.  What a fantastic lost opportunity but again a demonstration that Trump was never a leader and never cared about rank and file Americans regardless of party affiliation."
2021-03-10 16:45:25,"Whatever morsel of ""credit"" Trump and his enablers may be owed regarding the vaccine was more than surpassed by the number of needless American deaths that occurred because of his dithering and destructive words and modeling.

I would say the number of deaths attributed to Trump's destructive behavior and inaction easily top 100,000.

And we do not know where it will end, since he set the tone for the Greg Abotts, Kristi Noems and other Republican governors/politicians to unnecessarily string this out possibly for years to come, by ignorant policies that will continue to kill unnecessarily, and promote variants that will eventually undermine the vaccine."
2021-03-10 17:12:58,#45's help in this was very reluctant and his efforts were disingenuous.He was only interested in getting re-elected.
2021-03-10 16:31:17,"Trump took credit for 11 years of positive economic growth, although only 3 years of it were his. Trump was big on taking credit, even delaying Covid checks so they could have his own name on them."
2021-03-10 16:44:12,"Trump will always be remembered as the President who turned his back on the pandemic and spent his efforts shoring up his campaign.  Any “credit” goes straight to the new administration who put action plans together well before Biden was in office.   Any successful logistical campaign such as this involves a start-to-finish plan, something Trump had absolutley no interest in.  The pandemic was nothing more than a giant inconvenience for him.  Much of what has been done by Biden involved undoing the incompetant actions of the last administration."
2021-03-10 16:46:21,I’ll acknowledge that Trump and his team get some credit for initiating a vaccination program that Biden is getting kudos for when Trump gives Obama credit for the growing economy he inherited.
2021-03-10 17:08:28,"This article along with its headlines illustrates perfectly the inevitable result of our penchant to be “fair”.
Trump and his administration led a disjointed , half hearted, clueless operation. The work that deserves credit during that time  was done by that “deep state “ that he and his minions - both his political appointees and in congress, loathed. The deep state  made of hard working and smart civil servants are the ones who salvaged the process as best as they could do. 
Biden to his credit , brought in as political appointees people who knew what they were doing and he and others did nothing to interfere but made available the tools for them to succeed. Knowing when to do nothing but let the process run smoothly is an art that few understand and even fewer follow."
2021-03-10 15:48:57,"Trump's not responsible for $500k+ Covid deaths (as claimed by several comments here) any more than Cuomo is responsible for every nursing home death.   Maybe there's some way of measuring excess deaths caused by bad public messaging, policy decisions or whatever.    But it's a novel virus that kills vulnerable people.   It would have done that no matter what.   The same thing will happen in the next pandemic.   To believe otherwise is superstition, not science."
2021-03-10 17:04:17,"Trump told people to inject bleach, and that the pandemic would just go away.  His administration failed to order more vaccine when they had the chance, promised states doses that they didn't have, and lost track of the doses that they did have.  Trump refused to work with Biden during the transition and didn't even provide any sort of rollout/distribution plan.

Trump's only claim is that the vaccine was created while he was President.  But how did Trump help to create the vaccine?  Can anyone point to a deal he made to move the process along?  How about an executive order he signed?  Any way in which the White House did more than stand around while scientists did all the work? Anything?

Trump gets zero credit until he shows his work.   

Since Biden took over we've gone from Trumps ""Oops: Looks like we have fewer doses than we thought, but we'll vaccinate everybody eventually"" to ""We're aiming to have enough doses by May, but definitely by the end of the year"".  And that is thanks to a deal Biden made happen."
2021-03-10 16:27:19,"Why does the press have to make these comparison repeatedly?  Why not just celebrate the accomplishment and the hope for continued progress, regardless of who gets the credit.
John C"
2021-03-10 16:23:35,"Ms. LaFraniere's statement that ""Both administrations deserve credit, although neither wants to grant much to the other"" smacks of bothsidesism.  Trump launched Operation Warp Speed which he claimed was a ""massive scientific, industrial and logistical endeavour unlike anything our country has seen since the Manhattan Project.”

What really happened is that the Trump administration ""quietly took around $10 billion from a fund meant to help hospitals and health care providers affected by Covid-19 and used the money to bankroll Operation Warp Speed contracts"" according to ""Stat News"".  Commenters for Stat News also said that ""what the Trump administration chose to do isn’t illegal, but it is in a gray area. In other circumstances, officials could have faced criminal liability for spending money appropriated for one purpose on something entirely different.""

So please, let's not inflate the help the Biden administration got from Trump.  Operation Warp Speed changed the quantities of vaccine available to each state, week by week, and state health officials say the unpredictable shipments led to chaos on the ground, including the inability to quickly use up all of the doses sent to them, according to ""Pro Publica""."
2021-03-10 16:55:42,"Oh please.  Trump had nothing to do with the vaccine success.

The Federal Government, and career bureaucrats (the ""deep state""), deserve the credit.

And by the way, that is the same ""big"" government and the same public servants that Trump and the other reactionary right-wingers disparage.

If anyone else besides Trump had been in the White House the past four years, the vaccine roll-out would have happened sooner and, more important, there'd be hundreds of thousands more people alive today."
2021-03-10 15:57:32,"Pfizer did not participate in project warp speed. They funded the vaccine development on other own. All the other companies had started vaccine development when Trump was calling the pandemic a hoax. What credit does the Trump administration deserve? Azar claimed that 20 million doses of vaccine would be administered by the end of 2020. Only 2.1 doses were administered, a short fall of 90%. Give me a break!"
2021-03-10 16:06:39,"Yes, Biden is benefitting from vaccine development that happened during his predecessor’s administration. But his predecessor deserves no credit — you’ll recall that his proposed solutions for the pandemic included waiting for the virus to go away, drinking bleach and shining lights inside people’s bodies.  The heroes of this story are scientists who, despite being constantly maligned by the previous administration, stepped up and achieved something equivalent to a moon shot.  Let’s all give credit where credit is due and thank the women and men who worked around the clock to deliver a vaccine in literally world record time."
2021-03-10 16:39:36,"Let's never forget Trump threatened not to provide PPE to New York State because Cuomo was not ""appreciative.""  Trump said something along the lines of ""if they are nice to me, I can be nice to them.""  Trump also refused to speak to the Governor of Michigan because she did not treat him ""right.""  That kind of vindictiveness, during the height of the pandemic, was shocking to me.  It literally kept me up at night."
2021-03-10 15:53:40,"Let's not pretend that the pharmas were sitting on their hands until Trump said ""get us a vaccine, stat!"" The money to be made from being fastest and first is staggering. The Trump administration didn't make anything happen faster, didn't keep us safe while the vaccines were being developed, nor did it formulate a logistical game plan for rolling out the program across the country."
2021-03-10 16:11:42,"Trump helped by holding super spreader events (remember the billboards) with glee and in which most ""patriots"" did not wear a mask while riling them up as they sat/stood close to each other.  Trump helped by stoking his ""freedom fighters"" to go against governors whom were trying to tamp down rates on infection by social distancing guidelines and encouraging the use of wearing the dreaded mask. He lied about when he knew how serious this contagion was. If this article argues that essentially T called out the fire engines early, while continuing to add fuel to the conflagratory pandemic, then okay(?). He was president and I'm sure his arm was twisted to take these steps as politically it wasn't good for him to keep reminding the populace of the virus.  ""Warp Speed"" but while having the parking boot on the Space Force cruiser gets a ""With Trump's Help"" headline."
2021-03-10 15:57:37,"""The Biden team is “maintaining a very nice trajectory,” Mr. Mango said. “But don’t criticize us to make yourselves look better.”

""Maintaining"". Sure. Yes, Op Warp Speed was a success, but the ""former guy"", had no real distribution plan, and didn't use the Defense Production Act competently. Biden and his team deserve the credit for the very good distribution ramp up."
2021-03-10 16:40:21,"Remember, Trump spent most of his final days in office predicting there would be election fraud, then celebrating election fraud, then refusing to promote an orderly succession of power.  Any effort at getting the vaccine out couldn't have been less visible.  He deserves no credit. 

We're slowly regaining political strength  with a normal president who doesn't require special handling.  Trump took himself out of the presidential picture long before November 3, 2020, gone before he'd physically left. Now, every day is a new day.  And we deserve to be released from ever handling him again."
2021-03-10 16:45:39,"Like many of the people who have commented on this piece, I find the very idea that the previous administration deserves any credit for addressing the pandemic offensive."

2021-03-10 16:07:54,Who says government solutions are not effective?
2021-03-10 15:44:36,"True credit for swift development of covid19 vaccines goes to scientists and technologists like Bill Gates, who invested heavily in the promise of messengerRNA 10 years ago.  mRNA was foreseen as a promising way to leverage gene sequencing to quickly isolate specific strands of RNA to generate a targeted immune response. Thereafter it would take venture funding of firms like Moderna and BioNTech to stand up factories to produce these fragile mRNA, encasing them in unstable lipid cells, a process still fraught with glitches.

Further credit goes to global health experts and forward thinkers like Gates, Ron Klain and WHO scientists. In 2014 with Ebola raging in Africa and threatening as a pandemic, they unfolded a plan to quickly fund firms to parallel-process the development of new vaccines while simultaneously standing up factories to mass produce them, even at the risk of failure in the labs. Papers were published on this back in 2015, including one by Gates in the NEJM.

Some credit goes to Trump for this production funding, which mRNA startups and other pharmas availed of. But then he squandered this advantage by virus and public health denial, kleptocratic grabs of the money, and pitting Americans against each other and the world.

Biden deserves massive credit for correcting these grave errors and, most importantly, for winning his way into the WH to sweep away the cronies and virus deniers , and getting shots in arms at rates swiftly approaching 3 million per day."
2021-03-10 15:46:44,"If Trump could claim credit for an economy inherited from his predecessor, I see no reason why Biden cannot claim credit for the vaccine rollout. Trump (like Obama on the economy) was an ineffective messenger on COVID and vaccinations. Ineffective messaging cost us too many lives. Trump's team can go ahead and grumble, but their leader ultimately failed them (and the nation) by not rising to both the technical and communication challenges."
2021-03-10 16:03:21,"The true picture is one of balance.  Trump and his Administration were utterly negligent in the way the pandemic was impacting Americans.  It actively fought with States that it implored were on its own in finding PPE.  It peddled useless (or worse) drugs, giving false hope.  It claimed the virus was a hoax!  It actively discouraged mask wearing to slow the spread until a vaccine was available.

It also ran Operation Warp Speed to get tested vaccines into production.  Credit there (even if Trump tried to take credit for funding certain vaccines) is due.  But, one also wonders how much of Operation Warp Speed was crony capitalism at it finest.

Biden is getting stuff done.  We hear about the actual results, not the (mostly empty) promises.  The Former Guy would have touted beating up a subcontractor to make a needed component before actually contacting the vendor.  In the Biden admin, we hear about it after the changes have been implemented and producing results.

Trump's former administration wants some credit.  But laying the groundwork is a basic and expected part of the job.  It's what you're supposed to do!"
2021-03-10 16:11:22,"Always remember that Trump denied there was a problem, making it much worse. Anything he did afterwards was too little too late. Any credit he might get must be diminished by that. Biden never denied the problem, and acted swiftly to resolve it. Any credit he gets must be magnified by that."
2021-03-10 16:18:18,"Regardless of what some claim, President Trump put in place the groundwork to both develop a vaccine in the quickest time frame in history, and to deploy the vaccine in record time. I for one am thankful for what he has done, and for the transparency of his time in office. You may not have liked all that he did, but you knew what he was doing. Now we have a President that does not want to discuss his plans or meet with the press unless the questions are prepared ahead of time."
2021-03-10 16:34:44,"It's hard to imagine Trump, or his administration, being helpful except where tax cuts or furthering corruption are involved. Maybe in some parallel universe where up is down, et.  On second thought, not even there."
2021-03-10 16:39:30,"Wait, the Trump administration feels it is unfair ignore the progress under a previous administration and to take credit for hard work and improvements under that previous administration?
Then I guess they will be retracting all those Trump claims about their administration boosting the economy after a ""disastrous"" Obama administration?
Yeah, I didn't think so."
2021-03-10 16:41:53,"Each of the current three vaccine suppliers had 100 million doses purchased, and each allowed another 300 million to be purchased, which is already more doses than the US needs."
2021-03-10 15:59:27,"It's hard to ignore the context of Trump's failure of leadership throughout the pandemic. Just because his administration did a couple of things right, doesn't absolve him of his responsibility for the outcome. Over 500K American's died of COVID while he called it a hoax, politicized masks, mishandled the distribution of needed medical equipment, among other mistakes. And don't forget what Trump was doing during the last surge - plotting to overthrow the results of an election. So no, Trump does not deserve any credit. Biden and his team had to overcome Trump's policies and actions to get the USA to where we are now."
2021-03-10 16:26:14,It might have been easier for the Biden Administration to give credit to Trump's if the latter had actually allowed for a reasonable transfer of power and transition.  Instead they dug in based on the big lie and failed to assist Biden's incoming administration in myriad ways to allow a running start.  So I don't really think the Trump Administration has any legitimate claim to criticize Biden's since they never seemed to acknowledge its existence.  And that doesn't even include the January 6 insurrection.
2021-03-10 16:05:41,"Trump had no strategy and his administration blocked the access to decision making during transition, up to the very end. This made the beginning of new phase in vaccine rollout that much more difficult. 

My understanding is that this was done on purpose. Now they cry they are not getting enough credit."
2021-03-10 16:17:51,"No one, not Trump, not Biden not anybody could possibly accurately predicted the full consequences of a brand new deadly virus.  The virus was (and is in some respects) way beyond our science and medicine at the start at least. I even remember Fauci saying the virus wasn't a threat to the American people in the beginning. Playing the blame game s isn't really going to help.  Perhaps now we will have a little more respect for Mother Nature."
2021-03-10 17:05:26,"President Biden isn't Trump. President Biden is a very stable and psychologically secure individual and leader. If I recall correctly, weeks ago he gave Trump credit for initial vaccine production.
On the other hand, Trump has been constantly taking full credit for a growing economy he inherited from president Obama and then vice president Biden, never acknowledging the deep hole the latter have gotten us out from."
2021-03-10 17:10:33,"That is the way mature, intelligent governments should work. One  starts a work, and the other continues without insults or complaints.  While it is true Trump downplayed Covid19 as a hoax, probably because he did not want the economy to collapse and harm his reelection, he did start vaccine production. Biden has accelerated the production of all vaccine manufacturers and has efficiently rolled out putting the vaccine into people's arms. So both are to be commended, the way it should be."
2021-03-10 16:34:10,"Trump wanting credit for the vaccine rollout is rich, considering that Trump wanted to claim credit for a stellar economy that was only on the ascendent curve because of the intelligent and diligent work of President Obama."
2021-03-10 15:56:49,"The argument of this piece is that The Biden administration is unfairly being credited for greater success in controlling Covid, because the Trump administration had ramped up vaccine production.  However the article obscures the massive failures in the Trump administration regarding messaging, and in particular it’s unwillingness to implement a nationwide strategy for vaccination and all that entails.  Trump didn’t care about testing, or assuming a leadership role by the federal government in managing what was obviously a national crisis from the beginning. These omissions invalidate the argument made in the article."
2021-03-10 16:07:02,"First, it seems to me that the REAL credit for the vaccines belongs to science and scientists, who had a solution ready for a problem that had simply not yet occurred. That they were ready was Trump's good fortune, to say  nothing of  ours.

Meanwhile, Trump's primary interest in getting the solution deployed at ""warp speed"" was not to save American lives and alleviate American suffering, but to enhance his chances for re-election.

And also meanwhile, he's still at it, out of simple mean resentment, as far as I can see.  He continues to thumb his nose at common-sense safety protocols. He and his wife got vaccinated, but didn't tell his followers.  He's set no  positive examples, nor encouraged his faithful following to observe safe practices, get vaccinated, or anything else to reduce suffering and lives lost (That might end up making Biden look good.  Can't have that.)

As far as I'm concerned, Trump's miserly attitude and miserable failure to set the appropriate examples for his supporters to follow cancels out any efforts he might have made to facilitate fast deployment of vaccines.  He did that for himself.  Not for us."
2021-03-10 16:28:22,"The heavy equipment to expand the Pfizer facility was either already being manufactured before the Biden Administration was in office or at least was on order. The key date for J&J has not yet arrived. Biden deserves credit for maintaining the vaccine system that Trump put in place, the mask mandate, and publicly endorsing the wearing of masks. The current retreat in the virus is mainly due to Mother Nature and virus cycles let’s hope the vaccine can prolong the drop in cases and deaths."
2021-03-10 16:33:59,"I don’t begrudge anyone taking credit for what they actually did.
However, the huge death toll we experienced is due to only one administration. My grandmother’s advice still holds: take credit where credit is due; own up to mistakes."
2021-03-10 15:46:27,"The title is incorrect. Trump had nothing to do with what Biden accomplished. So if 'humming' is an appropriate description on what Biden accomplished then Biden deserves sole credit. A more accurate title would be  ""Biden Got the Vaccine Rollout Humming on a Start by Trump.""

However I thought the whole idea behind warp speed was to prepay for vaccine so when the vaccine was approved we'd have many millions of doses available. That premise of warp speed seems to have failed as manufacturers have little vaccine at approval and then have to ramp up production."
2021-03-10 16:33:53,"Did Trump take steps which helped the rollout? Yes.

But would the US be in its current plight - with the highest number of deaths - if Trump had appealed to science from the beginning? If the didn't claim the virus was a hoax? Or had imposed a nationwide curfew as leaders in other countries did?

As the saying goes, prevention is better than cure. But, of course, Trump will still get ""credit"" for curing a disaster he himself helped precipitate."
2021-03-10 16:53:18,"Hurrah, the government bureaucracy was effective, despite being essentially leaderless for at least the fourth quarter of 2020. Just because Trump was still resident of the Whitehouse does not mean he deserves credit for the effective operations of the government, which was miraculously able to facilitate production of these vaccines despite incompetence, malfeasance, and an apparent lack of interest at the top."
2021-03-10 16:18:52,"Really, the Trump administration wants to take credit for anything to do with this pandemic?  Trump literally worked against progress for nearly a year.  He refused to wear a mask and even contracted the disease himself.  He was against anything that would slow down the spread of the disease: masks, social distancing, contact tracing and lockdowns.  He said the cure can't be worse than the problem.  He is responsible for at least a couple hundred thousand deaths.  You want to give him credit, give him credit for that."
2021-03-10 16:47:11,"Let's not forget that the first available  vaccine  came from Pfizer, which refused seed money from the Operation Warp Speed out of fear of getting slowed down by government involvement: that Warp Speed failed to provide notable funding and planning help. for vaccine distribution within dyes by their governments; a!nd that the Trump administration over reported the quantity of vaccine available for distribution as its tenure ended."
2021-03-10 16:42:17,"Trump and his gang now care that they get credit for the vaccine from the doctors and scientists who they mocked, for a disease that they minimized, and for Trump’s leadership that costs thousands of lives and vast suffering. Just drift away into oblivion and be grateful you are not pursued for crimes you committed against humanity."
2021-03-10 16:44:11,"Trump or no Trump, the vaccines would have been developed. He was a non-factor on development. Parts of good team may have done some good, but Trump??! Where he was a factor was on his tone and politicization of mask wearing that led to hundreds of thousands of deaths. Where he was a factor was on severe cutbacks that allowed us to respond appropriately. This is not a man deserving of praise. He should be scorned for all eternity."
2021-03-10 17:06:22,"Trumps and the GOP's response was very slow at every step.They called covid a hoax, would not get PPE, testing and tracing out quickly, and tell everyone to mask and social distance,and their vaccine effort was too slow. 300 million single shot vaccines should have been produced within days of the Jansenn vaccine being approved by the FDA. This is  a pandemic. Every day counts. The virus is mutating. Everybody should have received a one shot Janssen vaccine by now."
2021-03-10 16:02:36,"Trump weaponized the COVID-19 pandemic.  He diverted PPE supplies from Blue states to Red states whenever those Blue states were not ""nice"" to him.

Trump was more concerned about naming the virus the China virus or Wuhan virus.  He was also obsessed with determining that China created this virus in a lab.  He also help spread conspiracy theories that the virus was a Hoax created by Dems to hurt him.

Trump was never concerned about the impact to Americans.  That was handled by his administration.  In the meantime, Trump was hawking outlandish remedies like bleach, ultra-blue light, and other absurdities.

The only two things Trump deserves credit for is dividing this country and playing golf to enrich himself."
2021-03-10 17:12:34,"Biden should give Trump exactly the same amount of credit for the Covid vaccine rollouts that Trump gave Obama for the robust economy he inherited.

Fair's fair."
2021-03-10 17:05:19,"Yeah, as much credit as he gave Obama for the upward economy he inherited."
2021-03-10 16:23:28,"Gee, The Trump administration took credit for the Obama/Biden economy and then tanked it.  And now are complaining that they aren't getting credit for a vaccine they said was unnecessary?"
2021-03-10 16:33:07,"The former president, Trump, routinely took credit for the accomplishments of Obama & Biden, esp. the economy.

So, turnabout is fair play.

Besides, you really have to look hard to see anything that Trump did was right."
2021-03-10 16:52:12,Well boo-hoo for Trump.  I seem to recall he spent his entire time in office taking credit for the US economic recovery and boom that Obama set in motion.  This is politics.  To the victor go the spoils.
2021-03-10 16:15:50,"This vaccine credit works I guess with his ""send me your donor money"" messaging to his Republican followers. All part of the big picture-the great ""I am""."
2021-03-10 16:20:39,"Donald Trump caused the largely preventable deaths of over 500,000 Americans.

Once he publicly accepts that - and only then - can we give him credit for helping to get a few thousand people inoculated.

And since he will never do the former, he will never get the latter."
2021-03-10 16:33:48,"How ironic. Trump complaining about not getting credit for all this hard work against the hoax, I mean coronavirus, and yet he trumpeted all his economic skill after being elected neglecting the fact he inherited Obama's recovery."
2021-03-10 16:53:19,"""Trump administration officials grumble that they laid the groundwork for surging vaccinations,..""

The arsonists complaining they got no credit for turning on the fire hydrant and running away to safety (after they got the first vaccinations at the WH). They take no blame for and still fail to offer sympathy for the 500,000--many avoidable-- American deaths on their watch. No they deserve no credit for utter incompetence and arrogance shown downplaying a pandemic."
2021-03-10 16:11:59,"The last guy and his wife got the vaccine way back when, and kept it a secret. What more needs to be said."
2021-03-10 16:31:39,"Not hard for Trump to focus on vaccines when he did nothing else to address Covid other than spreading it at plague parties. Meanwhile, 500,000 people dropped dead."
2021-03-10 16:43:27,"The bottom line is, anything and everything trump did with regard to the virus was predicated on one thing and one thing only:  ""what's in it for me (trump)?""."
2021-03-10 16:16:48,"Calling Trump's past officials as if they in present tense on your front page tag line is erroneous, or misleading. They are not officials anymore.
You also failed to mention that administration did almost nothing past those deals to assure administration and coordination,to get the drugs into people's arms. 
Whatever the reason, that was a grave error."
2021-03-10 16:49:22,"Trump is the ‘gift’ that keeps on giving, but more like an incurable venereal disease along the lines of genital herpes. He’s already responsible for weaponizing pandemic denial and causing hundreds of thousands of unnecessary American Covid deaths. (Arguably he also gave similar license to other autocrats around the world with predictably tragic results.) 

Trump’s contribution to vaccine development was only the product of his desire for unwarranted re-election. The money helped, but decades of vaccine research, including on coronaviruses, paved the way. And his team wanted no part of vaccine distribution or administration. Besides, Donald wouldn’t know the difference between an antibody and a Peabody. 

Even now, Trump’s malignant role modeling makes states breeding grounds for new viral variants. His inaction also made our pandemic recession deeper and longer. Even now, Trumpian governors in poorly run red states are opening up and discarding public health measures prematurely. And he, along with his Russian sponsors, may well contribute to a substantial number of Americans refusing vaccination. (Interestingly he and Melania did get vaccinated before he left office, but surreptitiously so as not to be a role model on Biden’s watch.)

Anyway, Trump will never atone for the death and misery on his watch. He was never up to the task of governing or acting in the interest of others. And the fallout from his reign of error will probably last for years."
2021-03-10 16:29:02,"We spent 4 years hearing trump and his acolytes take credit for an economy that President Obama saved from the ashes and made into a growing economy. Now trump wants credit for a playbook. What playbook? His thousands of executive orders that were all over the place? His mocking of people wearing masks? Calling COVID a hoax? Endangering Secret Service agents with exposure to coronavirus? Tweeting ""Liberate"" messages to fight mask and social distancing laws that led to Michigan's governor almost kidnapped and murdered? Or trump perfecting his golf game while hundreds of thousands of people died from infection? The worst president in the US history should get no credit."
2021-03-10 16:13:10,"It has been clear to me that the last administration meaning the President never ever wanted to save lives, it was always about perception and him and only him. It never ever would have mattered as long as he got reelected. We were and always will be ""road kill"" to him. It will never happen, but it would be sweet justice if he were brought up on charges of mass murder at the Hague. He has been and will always be a stain on our great country as long as he is around. Nothing ever is ""his fault""."
2021-03-10 16:29:58,"""To Trump administration aides, the new president’s crowing rings off-key. Mr. Biden is proclaiming victory off his predecessor’s achievements""

Kinda like how Trump inherited an economy that was already humming, and just weeks later was proclaiming that he'd built the strongest economy ever?

Them's the breaks, Trumpies.

Such a striking contrast between administrations. Biden sensibly employed the ""underpromise and overdeliver"" tactic and is now basking in its glow. Trump employed the ""promise the moon and then act with callous ineptitude"" strategy and well, here are."
2021-03-10 16:35:02,"Amusing that the NYT's opinion is that ANYTHING has been/is positive about the USA's response to COVID-19.

Here in western New York state the vaccination ""program"" (in quotes because the word implies something organized) has been a complete patchwork of well-meaning but poorly managed efforts -- some arranged by the state, some by the county, some by hospital/doctor groups (no one knows for sure!).

Any suggestion that anyone has a real plan (which can be publicly distributed) is either a fervent wish or an outright lie."
2021-03-10 17:07:00,"No matter what Trump claims now, in the public's mind, he's remembered more for pooh-poohing the grave danger we faced when coronavirus landed on American soil. He did not bother to wear a mask for months, or insist that the White House staff wear them. Consequently, a lot of White House staffers and he himself came down with COVID-19. He might have met his maker but because of his position, he received intensive and the most expensive medical care and treatment possible and survived. He was proclaiming vaccinating everyone in six months, which would have required administering 3.6 million doses (based on two doses per person) every day. That goal is still not achieved.

Mixing fact with fiction, Trump has always crowed about his achievements. He is no longer the President. The most good he can do as a private citizen is to shut up."
2021-03-10 16:40:47,"What a joke. Any progress was in spite of Trump, not because of it. The pharma companies being able to increase production had nothing to do with anything the failing Trump administration did."
2021-03-10 16:16:35,"Hmmm...maybe if Trump had spent more time promoting his efforts to address the pandemic instead of spinning election conspiracies, he would have been re-elected?  At this point, it’s all just sour grapes!"
2021-03-10 16:42:31,"Nothing, absolutely nothing will make up for the fact that Trump needlessly made masking a culture war issue. The deaths from that one act alone are truly nauseating to contemplate. Look to east Asian nations to see what could have been accomplished with broadly adopting that one measure alone, even if every other aspect of pandemic control were flubbed. Remember, Japan debarked the Diamond Princess, very nearly patient zero of this pandemic, without proper precautions on its own shores, but never suffered the excruciating deaths tolls experienced here."
2021-03-10 16:12:19,"Any credit for the response to pandemic under Trump administration should go to states and their governors. Without them it would be a catastrophe. In fact, Trump mostly stayed in a way, rather than being helpful."
2021-03-10 16:14:31,"The first vaccines available were from Pfizer who wisely chose not to take money from Trump’s cartel, thus avoiding thuggish strong arming to get their vaccine out before it was determined to be safe and effective. This article doesn’t mention the complete failure of Trump’s team to set up an effective vaccination plan to get shots in arms. Biden’s team started from a dead stop for vaccine distribution. We all know people who are getting vaccines now and we can all see clearly the difference between the present competence of Biden’s team versus the clown show of the former guy. Alex Azar, former drug company exec and Trump’s point person on vaccine development, bragged they were running their own version of the Manhattan Project. He was limited to his narrow skill set of throwing money at drug companies and he failed to plan for getting vaccines in arms. So if this was the former guy’s Manhattan Project, they encouraged building bombs while failing to build aircraft carriers and planes to deliver the bombs. Let’s praise the real heroes here - the scientists."
2021-03-10 16:16:11,Add up all the positive things Trump did to combat COVID.  Then add the negative.  Which pile is bigger?  Can anyone suggest with a straight face that the sum total of his actions was a net positive?
2021-03-10 16:32:59,"OK, fine, share the vaccine credit, as long as Trump takes exclusive credit for half a million Americans (and counting) DEAD. If our national response under Trump had been more like New Zealand's and less like a banana republic's, we wouldn't be in our current situation."
2021-03-10 17:31:01,"The perspective this piece seems missing, from what I recall, is the divisive, inconsistent, and just plain incorrect messaging from the Trump administration regarding the necessary response required of both the public and of local governments to effectively deal with the pandemic.  When it comes time to look back on the history of this period, I think I'll wait for a Ken Burns documentary."
2021-03-10 16:09:00,I do not like Donald Trump. But to believe—as many in this comment section apparently do—that the massive apparatus of the federal government did nothing positive during the four years he was in power is to be just as deluded as those who believe the presidential election was stolen.
2021-03-10 16:55:12,"I almost dropped my subscription this morning when I saw this article. How farcical the column's premise. It is shameful. It is an affront to all who kept abreast of the events. Over 500,000 people have died. Trump's admin. cancelled the working arm of the government's of pandemic preparedness, addressed the nation by calling the virus a hoax, repeatedly, offered the lunacy of dangerous and or ineffective cures, railed against blue states for being virus hot-spots, then added some magical thinking to boot. ""It'll just go away. It'll disappear."" That whack-a-doodle Trump did nothing. Fauci, to a great extent single-handedly kept the nation on the right track. Trump deserves all the excoriation he gets, but no praise, no glory!"

By stonewalling the incoming administration at every level to sabotage their first critical months of transition?

At least Mr. Paul Mango, a perfect example of said toadie, admitted that Biden was ""maintaining a very nice trajectory” when it came to Biden's COVID actions - something trump supporters never admit about trump's maintaining of President Obama's economic trajectory. 

But, Mr. Mango said. “don’t criticize us to make yourselves look better.”

Truer words have never been spoken, if only they had been followed by trump himself."
2021-03-10 16:31:36,"This story is an outrage and an insult to both the readers and reporters of the Times.

Trump and his toady enablers did nothing but deny, obfuscate, denigrate and debase the scientific community, and politicize everything from the wearing of masks to the public health messaging of the CDC.  These last two are particularly egregious.  Wearing a mask is the proven way to protect others from the spread of the virus, which is our responsibility to one another as citizens; has this attitude prevailed during WW2 we would have lost the war.  The CDC, as well as public health officials at the state and local level, have a duty to us as fellow citizens, to provide non-partisan, non-political guidance based on scientific observation and evidence in order to protect the public health.  To warp, twist, and politicize this function, and look the other way when public health officials are threatened with physical violence, is to put us on the path to another million or so unnecessary deaths.

That there is a vaccine at all is due entirely to the global community of scientists who collaborated in unprecedented breadth, and achieved a result with unprecedented speed.  Despite the fact that Trump and his corrupt henchmen took every opportunity to undermine and denigrate their efforts.

Has James Bennett been reinstated in the newsroom?"
2021-03-10 17:15:16,"When the vaccine rollout began in December, Mr. Biden vowed that his administration would average one million shots a day during his first 100 days in office — enough to vaccinate 50 million people by the end of March.

If his term begins January 20 that means 100 days is the end of April not March."
2021-03-10 16:48:29,"OK - no one expects that in an argument like this, ""fighting fair"" is gonna happen.

But when those ""score cards"" are turned in, something you all but omitted is going to cost team Trump almost all of the points they might otherwise claim.

THAT IS - By minimizing the severity (and amping that message up and turning it into a macho and ""you gonna trust those coastal MD's?"" thing) of Covid ... and the measures to keep the spread down AND his own ""brush with death"" - pause, let's all think what we probably are too superstitious to write....

Trump UNDID 90% of what he might otherwise take part credit for.

That is, as Jewish people are wont to say this time of year, ""IF HE HAD ONLY made developing a vaccine a top priority, it would have been enough!""

ALAS - this not in any liturgy. b.t.w. - he probably gets FULL CREDIT for vaccination refusal rates well over 50% in parts of the South and Midwest. OK, maybe, in Wyoming, ""just saying no"" isn't borderline self-destructive, but it sure is in towns and cities in the Carolinas and the Dakotas.

Think about it - as with polio and the measles, we have it within reach to save millions of lives - not to mention an enormous productivity gain for our dicey economy.

But not if enough people ""opt out."" Yes, Donald probably got immunity the hard way and then had the shots off camera. Pence did TWO decent things in his 4 years, one of which was his photo-op early in the vac. roll-out.

But where is NO THANKS heard more - red states or blue?"

Neither company owes its output to the government- they achieved a moonshot despite the government. The vaccine rollout- as rocky as it can feel- would be a smoldering disaster under the past administration. Why- after an entire year of Trump declaring the pandemic over, ignoring the staggering losses, and continuously dismantling all public health outreach- is NYT looking for reasons to suggest ‘good people on both sides’? Puh-lease!"

2021-03-10 17:33:51,"Thanks for contrasting Biden and Trump. I've always been struck during the Trump years about how the supposed business genius ran things. And how Republicans, who call themselves the party of business, slavishly followed someone who has failed miserably in business. Don't forget all of Trump's bankruptcies. Business and management schools teach under promise and over deliver. Trumps history is all about overpromising and under delivering. The schools teach the importance of surrounding yourself with competent people. Trump has always surrounded him self with yes-men and lackeys. Nice to see competency back in the White House."
2021-03-10 17:34:18,The Daily Kos has a great follow up to this article.  The contributions from the Trump Administration did not include a system for the distribution of the vaccine beyond any state's borders.  This article fails to mention that the distribution is even a factor.
2021-03-10 17:31:49,"Neither administration should try and take too much credit for what was 100% a private enterprise effort. The only thing Trump did correct was to place large purchase orders in early, which was a no-brainer in an election year he was on track to assisting kill 500,000. For Biden’s efforts, Pfizer had already scheduled to significantly ramp up production after a temporary shutdown. Also, the filling equipment required always takes longer to order, build, install and validate than the pandemic is old, so there is no credit to any govt. there."

2021-03-10 17:34:11,"There is one important limitation to this line of thinking: the Trump Administration did not buy enough doses in advance to vaccinate the population. In a pandemic that will cost our economy trillions of dollars, the Trump Administration was pinching pennies. A wiser Administration would have purchased far more doses in advance than the population needs to hedge on final efficacy results by any of the recipients. Besides, if the US bought far more doses than it needs, the additional doses could be shared with the world."
2021-03-10 17:31:03,"Trump helped?  Are you referring to the same Trump that threw away the pandemic response plan handed to him by the Obama Administration, ignored and continued to downplay the seriousness of the Covid-19 virus from the get go, turned a deaf ear to all of the medical experts, hogtied and gagged the CDC, and failed to implement policies that would have gotten larger quantities of vaccine available earlier?  Is that the same Trump of this article?"
2021-03-10 17:36:25,"Recently, Dr. Fauci, in response to a question about the Biden administration's claim that they had to start from scratch in vaccine distribution, responded that the assessment wasn't exacty true. He went on to say that there were alot of ideas from the former administration.  That's nice but how far will ideas get you when there's a raging pandemic that has taken so many lives? And who knows whether those 'ideas' for distribution or otherwise were ever going to be implemented? Remember the early idea of sending five masks to each American household? Dropped because masking isn't 'masculine', they didn't want to invoke the Defense Production Act, and in the end they just abandoned the states to their own devices.

So please, NYT, don't go overboard with the flashy headline and attempt at reputation laundering for the past administration. This is an administration that failed to deliver on Covid, and has the nerve to deny the legitimacy of the new administration.  All I know is that every morning  I thank the powers that be that Joe Biden is the president to get us out of this nightmare. I don't want to even imagine where the country would be now on Covid vaccinations without a competent administration in place."
2021-03-10 17:20:50,"Biden is doing a great job.
But vaccinations are too slow. Pharmacies have the doses to administer but stop administering them because they have their regular work-filling in prescriptions. The lines are long and people are standing in line for three hours. Social distancing is not followed. It is chaotic,with no lines.

He might have even had his day in the sun had he not hamstrung the effort in every other way, in particuar firing BARDA chief Rick Bright and tripping up Anthony Fauci and Deborah  Birx at every turn. In any case, Pfizer didn't participate in Warp Speed, so saying that   Moderna and Pfizer both benefited is not accurate.  Also, I  appreciate that invoking the Defense Protection Act helps to  get equipment and material supplies together faster but blocking exports can hurt American companies producing the vaccine overseas as well as slow the vaccination effort abroad, which will not serve anyone in the end. Pfizer as well as J&J and Novavax are working with CDMOs in Europe, and there is an exchange of goods going back and forth in both directions. The EU's ill advised export authorization scheme aside, European companies did come to the forefront to help each other without any wartime measures. Some NGOs, including the WHO,  reportedly are planning to meet this week to discuss vaccine nationalism."
2021-03-10 17:17:10,"Wow…

Credit due is noted. 

But, I give Biden a slight edge for not being a life-long reprobate liar who discriminated against black people in his housing units, crowed about his business prowess while running casinos into the dirt, defrauded thousands of Americans with a phony ""University"" scam, willingly accepted stolen campaign material from the Russians to become president, abused migrants in ways that would be the envy of any tyrant in history…

And, took a page out of Napoleon's playbook when confronting a yellow fever epidemic killing his army, making it about his own self-preservation with just a hint of empathy for anyone else. 

So, yeah, slight edge to Biden."

Trump Administration officials need to take credit for butchering 400,000 +of my fellow Americans by COVID-19 by calling it a hoax that would go away like a miracle brought down by summer heat, bleach, ultraviolet light and an anti-malarial drug.

Along with the Trump Administration advising Americans not to get tested nor wear masks nor social distance nor contact trace nor isolate nor treat for COVID-19.

He was careful to omit the fact that Obama prevented the economy from going off a cliff (a disaster created by Republican policies) and had put it on track to recovery.

Trump should get a small amount of credit but the bulk of it should go to doctors and scientists. These professionals often had to work with a president who had no interest facts, science, and medicine."

Reminds me a bit of Trump and his administration taking credit for an economy that was rolling along well before Trump came into office.

However, with regards to covid-19 and the vaccinations, Trump destroyed any goodwill that he might have garnered from the Warp Speed operation through his flagrant denial of the seriousness of SARS-CoV2, his repudiation of mask wearing, his inane and bombastic covid-19 press conferences, his push to open up states' businesses and schools while state officials were trying to help beat back covid illnesses and deaths, he refusal to provide Federal guidance and leadership for dealing with covid and pushing responsibilities to the states, his utter disregard for the health and safety of the American people, his political manipulation of the CDC's guidance to the American people, and his stated refusal to take any responsibility for the outcomes of pandemic.

The incompetence of the Trump Administration is monumental, mainly due to Trump himself being a failed leader.
The Biden Administration came in like a breath of fresh air and completely changed the narrative about vaccinations, masking, COVID and saving lives.
My mother died from COVID in a nursing home on April 15, 2020, almost a year ago now. If Trump had shouldered the responsibility of leading this nation, he would not have let her die and be buried in a drive by funeral. But he was worried about optics and reelection. So, no, I fiercely do not give credit to the failed Trump presidency and cheer Biden and his staff for looking out for the American people."

Moreover, I can say with certainty as a professional negotiator that the White House didn't exactly present an image as being serious, credible, or competent, prerequisites for getting deals done effectively.  I'm sure Trump's constant lying, bullying, and posturing exasperated even the most hardened business lawyers and executives.  Constant threats to blow up deals is a sign of weakness, not of strength."

Where were these noble billionaires and corporations then? What were Trump and his people doing during the entire pandemic? Isn’t the idea behind GOP deregulation that capitalists will self-regulate and always do the right thing? Let’s take a look at just a few things our unregulated American corporations and their politicians did during the pandemic:

- Airline and cruise ships continued to bring millions of passengers from China and Europe across our borders. 

- PPE, essential supplies and pharmaceutical stockpiles were sold off to China and other countries. 

- The wealthy owner class got wealthier; the stock market soared while average Americans suffered and died. Politicians insider traded their stocks. 

- They actively downplayed or outright denied the pandemic while secretly profiting from taxpayer largess in the form of “pandemic relief.” 

Trump, American corporations and the GOP don’t deserve any credit; they are not on equal footing with Biden and Democrats. There is no equivalency or partnership or both sides. They grifted during the pandemic while people died. 

I really can’t understand the media’s obsession with 1. Ignoring Trump and his people’s 4  years crime, corruption and treason spree at American taxpayers expense, and 2. attempting to rewrite the history the last 4 years. There must be money behind this."

The issue isn’t that they did some things correctly, or got some things in place, it’s that what they did they did not do well, they did much very badly, and they did not get the job done in any event. First, Trump’s decision to off-load decision-making with regard to reducing the spread to state governments was a disaster, and huge numbers of people are dead because of it. Second, Trump failed to ever institute an effective testing regime. Third, the Trump administration did nothing to prepare for the vaccine rollout, other than, again, off-loading the administration to states. The only thing Trump did was pay a lot of money to pharmaceutical companies to develop vaccines, but taking credit for that is like a receiver celebrating when he catches a football — that’s the job. So too bad for Trumpists. They failed in their given task, were fired, and some others came in and, so far, are succeeding.  That’s how the world works."

Private  industry developed the vaccine based on research done be the US government that long predated Trump. All he did was authorize a contact to purchase a grossly inadequate supply of vaccine  and entirely omit any plan for distribution and injection.I don’t know what this help to build some buildings or 18 instances of invoking the DPA act to insure “adequate supplies” amounts to, but until Sharon LaFreniere can write an accurate article describing how operation “warp speed” amounted to anything other than an effort by private industry and what exactly those 18 instances of invoking the DPA actually amounted to, I put this article in the category of throwing shade for the sake selling newspapers. Moderns actually DECLINED government intervention for fear of crippling interference. 

Without Biden, there would be grossly inadequate vaccine supplies, no plan for distribution and no plan for  by administration of vaccines. Unless 500,000 dead people and no federal pandemic plan whatsoever amounts to “help”, this article should be used to line the cat box.

2021-03-10 17:51:27,"Why is the New York Times so enthusiastic about rewriting history so that the people who brought us 550,000 deaths due to their negligence smell better?

Trump White House staffers can whine all they want.  If they'd been competent the initial roll-out wouldn't have been a disaster.

You do this every single time.  Republican presidents get a pass, and when the Democrat takes over to clean up the mess the Republicans created you re-write history to make the Republicans less culpable.

Every single time.  Do you never get tired of it?"
2021-03-10 17:15:35,"While I appreciate learning about how the gears of government have and have not facilitated vaccine production and distribution, I’m dismayed to see the Times framing legitimate journalism with a headline and sub-bullets that drive a subjective narrative (veiled as reporting externally on the public narrative): 

“Credit is likely to go to...” 

The public perception of where credit goes is largely driven by these headlines. It reminds me of post-debate reporting: “People are saying that ______ won the debate.” That line may not be a lie or opinion, but, really, this style of reporting is indirectly calling a winner by focusing the reporting on public reaction rather than on policy substance. Sure, public opinion matters to election outcomes in a democracy; it merits some degree of coverage. But the feedback circles between public opinion and reporting on public opinion are so tight; the subjective public “credit” for the vaccine development is likely to go to whoever the Times reports that it’s “likely to go to...” It’s a tiresome circle.

I’d like to see the Times do better at framing their reporting on substance rather than on the expected narrative; the latter will inevitably be a vapid, self-fulfilling prophecy."
2021-03-10 16:47:03,"Can we please just STOP. TALKING. ABOUT. TRUMP.? There are so many other stories, problems, and solutions happening around the world. This man does not deserve our attention.

2021-03-10 18:09:42,The trump administration and trump take all the credit for things he did't.  Never once did they thank Obama for handing him the longest economic recovery in US history.  Or getting the radical right to vote for him...If wasn't for Obama or his dad he would be NOTHING!!
2021-03-10 16:34:57,"""With Trump's Help""? 
Not communicating with Biden Admin. officials, not helping states co-ordinate vaccination programs, not using all means available to get vaccine production ramped up?
If that's what the Times calls ""help"", I'd hate to see your definition of obstruction."
2021-03-10 17:08:59,"“But don’t criticize us to make yourselves look better.”
Unbelievable. Whose playbook does this best describe? Who passed on distribution responsibility to the states (who, according to the former president and current GOP, do not deserve federal COVID funding). ""We're not a shipping clerk.""

Trump inherited a mess? Laughable. President Biden inherited a country governed by lies and ignorance: the pandemic is a hoax, no worst than the flu, and the easiest, cheapest, most common sense defense - wearing a mask - is an assault on personal freedom. The Trump administration was anti-science, combative, and makes defeating the COVID virus more difficult. Their policies were cruel and are responsible for American deaths. This fact far overshadows their partnership with Pharmaceutical companies."
2021-03-10 18:11:02,"Overall, the Trump administration's response to the pandemic was disastrous & negligent. 

All thanks to it getting politicized for God-knows-why."
2021-03-10 18:15:32,"Nonsense! The Trumpians had nothing to do with the successes Biden is having. Biden knows how to engage and make the system work as efficiently as possible. Trumpty Dumpty and his gang knew how to create and maintain chaos and then try to take credit if anything ""good"" happened. The only thing I give them some credit for is the vaccine creation effort but I'm guessing that was mostly some of the aids who tried to do the right thing rather than Trump trying to be a good president. The only credit Trumpians should take is for the 4 disastrous years of their administration. Unfortunately that disaster continues to today from outside the WH. I hope for all our sakes that he/they just go away as quickly as possible. Biden-Harris are the heroes in my book. This is what a good administration should be like. Keep on truckin', Biden-Harris and team."
2021-03-10 18:20:05,"This story purports to show that Biden built on what Trump did with the vaccines, and thus Trump deserves some credit.  But it actually shows that Biden is doing a lot more than Trump ever did, the reporter's attempts to spin and ""both sides"" the situation notwithstanding.  Trump couldn't even be bothered to deploy the DPA to help Pfizer's suppliers produce more, presumably because they self-funded their vaccine instead of taking Operation Warp Speed funding and because he thought Pfizer was slow-walking the vaccine to hurt his re-election chances. Taking credit for doing something was more important to Trump than actually doing something, as the article makes clear. People were and are dying; Trump should have been focused on doing everything he could to stop that, regardless of what  happened on Nov. 3. But he wasn't, because he's a narcissistic sociopath. 

So, this article doesn't say what the reporter thinks it does, and despite her efforts to obfuscate the truth came through quite clearly. The question is why the NYT feels the need to provide ""balance"" here."
2021-03-10 15:43:28,Remember when Trump took credit for Obama’s economy?
2021-03-10 18:17:06,"This is rich. Trump again whimpering that he’s not getting credit for his part in the vaccine. For the first three years of his administration, Trump crowed about an economy that was doing so well- an economy he inherited from his predecessor. Did we ever hear him thank Obama for that?"
2021-03-10 18:19:57,Trump was an asset to the virus. He created obstacles and played favorites rather than construct an overall approach. He never joined the battle and he played the fool for Fox media. Biden has created a plan with all elements involved and has done it in conjunction with taking over the country. The stimulus packages under Trump were targeted to the top of the economic ladder and were ineffective. Biden has provided a stimulus package for those truly hurt by the virus and has made it inclusive. He has also done it knowing the GOP will use it against him in 2022. Biden is acting like a President.
2021-03-10 18:02:43,"Trump administration officials ""laid the groundwork"" for surging covid is more like it - they called it a hoax, urged the public not to wear masks and lied covid was like the flu, did an amatuer job of getting the vaccine companies to produce vaccine and made no distribution plans, and now they're wining they aren't being praised?      Of course they did SOME things, that was their job and they did it disastrously!                                                                        Thank Heavens the Biden administration are now doing such an excellent job getting vaccine production and distribution jacked up and going, and messaging to the public, also an important part of all this. Kudos all the way to the new administration."
2021-03-10 18:12:27,i’m confused how one gets credit for something that doesn’t exist? or at most disappeared last april just like the flu? Is it like the healthy economy they inherited from the obama administration and managed to bungle other than on the matrix of the stock market - which we know is not based in reality?
2021-03-10 18:16:14,"Give me a break. Trump never cared about anything related to the pandemic. On the other hand, there may have been a few administration officials who served in good faith. In particular Alex Azar, his HHS secretary, should get some credit. This is not splitting hairs."
2021-03-10 18:08:53,"Trump could have gotten vaccinated in public and made a speech touting operation warp speed. But instead, he hid. This is what he gets."
2021-03-10 18:03:11,"Imagine if Trump had just done what Germany and Canada did, we would have half the deaths that we do today. Vastly less still if we followed Japan, and Taiwan's lead, countries that have substantially greater density that the US. Sure you can give Trump some credit but he had the hose in his hand to put out the fire, did little to stop it's progression, and allowed it to engulf this nation with dread and despair. I really see no value in this story."
2021-03-10 18:27:57,"Whoopee for those that did something right. What I remember is the abject nightmare of hundreds of thousands suffering and dying while a dreadful dictator wanna be scoffed at masks, spent all his time spreading lies and poison, and never bowed his head with any humility over the heartbreak Americans were going through. If I never see his face or hear his voice again it will be a sweet mercy."
2021-03-10 18:21:55,"Don’t worry about it.  The virus disappeared months ago right?

“You know, a lot of people think that goes away in April with the heat — as the heat comes in. Typically, that will go away in April” February 10 2020.

“It’s going to disappear. One day — it’s like a miracle — it will disappear. And from our shores, we — you know, it could get worse before it gets better. It could maybe go away. We’ll see what happens. Nobody really knows” February 27, 2020

“It’s going to go away, hopefully at the end of the month. And, if not, hopefully it will be soon after that.”  March 31, 2020

“And I think we’re doing very well on the vaccines but, with or without a vaccine, it’s going to pass, and we’re going to be back to normal.” May 5, 2020


Magic thinking obviously didn’t make it go away.  In the meantime he made protective measures as simple as wearing a mask about whether or not you were a tough guy.

The NYTimes is one of the worst offenders of this kind of bothersider-ism that establishes false equivalencies and covered Trump as if he was as qualified candidate as Clinton (love her or hater, she could certainly have done the job).

Trump and his administration botched the vaccine rollout with deadly effects. Thanks to their incompetence, more than  530,000+ Americans are dead because:

He downplayed the severity—even though he knew coronavirus was deadly. 

Scorned the use of masks, turning it into to a toxic contest of manliness, with all Republicans following suit. 

Held super spreader events including those at the White House and in a Tulsa, OK stadium. Even January 6, unmasked GOP members spread the virus to colleagues.

Promoted an unproven cure (hydroxychloroquine) with deadly side effects.

Biden's rollout was triumph of another kind: competence"

Down the memory hole is the failure of the Trump administration to let Biden's team see their plan before taking office, delaying the start of the acceleration we have witnessed. The Trump administration was characterized by laziness, incompetence, and ideological rigidity; Biden's is hard-working, competent and flexible.  We would be nowhere near where we are with the Trump team in charge."
2021-03-10 17:15:07,"I appreciate a free and fair press, therefore I have to condone this NYT article.

They messed things up almost wherever possible. They turned down dose contracts! Give me a break."

Over 500,000 people have died. Trump's admin. cancelled the working arm of the government's of pandemic preparedness, addressed the nation by calling the virus a hoax, repeatedly, offered the lunacy of dangerous and or ineffective cures, railed against blue states for being virus hot-spots, then added some magical thinking to boot. ""It'll just go away. It'll disappear."" That whack-a-doodle Trump did nothing. Fauci, to a great extent single-handedly kept the nation on the right track.

So we should probably get excited and heap headline praise for the one positive action they initiated. 

Such a low bar, isn’t it?"

The New York Times reported that 1,885 people died of COVID-19 yesterday. That is close to 2/3 of the lives lost on 9/11.

From The Economist ,  February 6 th, 2020

Title

""The race to produce a vaccine for the latest coronavirus

Quote

""There are not many factories that can mass-produce vaccines, so new vaccines often wait in a long queue. Aware of this problem, the American government has built dedicated manufacturing facilities that can produce vaccines rapidly for emergencies.”

           The Economist, UK

Note:  this was published 1 years , one  months ago, when Trump was in office"
2021-03-10 18:38:47,"To give credit to Trump for anything that was done right is ridiculous.  It is normal that some of the people working to get the vaccines to the people IN SPITE OF Trump's attempts to sabotage Covid relief every step of the way, only goes to show that even under a corrupt regime, some people succeed in carrying out the work needed to provide some much needed vaccines. The Postal Service workers, in the same sense, tried their best to fullfill their duties in spite of interference from the Trump administration during the November election. Place credit where credit is due!"
2021-03-10 18:24:31,This is no surprise. Trump has always taken credit for just about everything unless it didn't work and then he simply lied and said it did or blamed others for the failure.
2021-03-10 19:13:04,Trump administration help?  I seem to recall that the Biden transition team was denied access to the critical agencies necessary for a smooth transition.
2021-03-10 19:19:07,"Oh, please. Trump never does anything right, except grifting. In fact, he worked against everything that should have been done to control the pandemic. He should get no credit for anything pandemic related. I can't wait to read the history books 10-20 years from now."
2021-03-10 18:40:59,"Three of my neighbors who were all Trump lovers, never wore masks and were in their 80s, passed away from Covid in January. He is responsible for their deaths as well as more than half a million others. And I’m supposed to thank him?"
2021-03-10 18:56:33,"Americans of both political parties should celebrate the creation of the vaccine, but also demand that congress determine how many more Americans died because Donald Trump refused to issue a mask mandate.  Did Donald Trump ""Help"" cause an extra 100,000 American deaths or JUST ""Help"" 50,000 unnecessary deaths.  Donald Trump needs to get ""credit"" for this too."
2021-03-10 19:28:51,"Yes, trump got the ball rolling regarding vaccines research but something tells me the delivered vaccines would still be languishing in some warehouse until someone with organizing and logistic skills could step up. Or, trump would use the vaccines as bartering tools. Vaccines for votes....a transactional man if ever there was one."
2021-03-10 19:07:39,"Trump spent a year downplaying the threat of the virus and ridiculing the measures all Americans could take to stay healthy. Many Republican governors and Trump supporters followed suit. The result was more sickness and death than was likely avoidable under a different American administration with a better message. If the trumpers want some credit for the development of the vaccines, then they should also be ready to accept some blame for the health disaster they facilitated."
2021-03-10 19:03:27,"You do realize that the content of your piece doesn't actually support your suggestion that ""Biden Got the Vaccine Rollout Humming, With Trump’s Help""? 

Maybe you should read what you wrote: 

""Pfizer officials privately suggested that the Trump administration not only was wrongfully bad-mouthing the company but also had refused for months to invoke the Defense Production Act to order suppliers to prioritize Pfizer’s needs, as it did for the other vaccine developers under federal contract"" 

and

""Mr. Trump routinely boasted of imminent achievements, including a vaccine rollout before Election Day, only to fall short"".

Better still, read your own paper from January 17: 

""States are scrambling after the Trump administration’s vaccine promise falls apart."""
2021-03-10 18:45:46,"I don't know what world this report comes from, but it's not the one I live in.

- Trump repeatedly downplayed, demeaned, or otherwise discouraged the use of masks, mandatory mask orders, and then doubled down passing on information about miracle cures that didn't work and had no basis in science.

- Trump's family and enablers completely flouted mask guidelines. See the Presidential debates.

- Trump held state dinners and social affairs where no masks were present, and as a result, more people got sick. It's well documented. See the gathering for Amy Coney Barrett as an example.

- Let's count the number of times Trump was golfing while there are Americans dying in droves.

- Trump spent a lot of time and effort on trying to nullify the election and then pretty much sat around sulking.

- When the Trump administration deigned to give a press conference, it generally was either total propaganda, playing to softball questions from propaganda networks, or a screed where journalists trying to do their job were yelled at.

- The Trump administration did absolutely nothing at all to assist with a transition to the Biden administration.

- Trump has done this many times before -- he takes credit for other's work but never owns up to anything.

- Let's also not forget Trump was on the National Mall and certainly contributed to what was one of the most terrifying and embarrassing assaults on American democracy in our history."
2021-03-10 18:58:33,"1. When will variant boosters for mRNA vaccines (Moderna and Pfizer) become available?
2. Will Biden's focus on supplying Johnson and Johnson 66% efficacy vaccines instead of the Moderna/Pfizer 95% efficacy vaccines significantly reduce potential fatalities and disabilities?
3. Has the chaos of Trump's pandemic management significantly abated yet?
4. Will the pandemic start all over again if a variant renders the current immunizations ineffective?
5. What's being done globally to prevent the next mystery pandemic from taking hold?
6. If COVID-19 is still endemic and the virus mutating in other parts of the world, are we acting rationally by limiting our immunization concerns  and actions to the USA?
7. We've already had more than a year of global development efforts for therapies to reduce the  severity of and to cure COVID-19. What are the statistics of any progress? Are any advances, even if anecdotal (from ER and ICU medical facilities) or limited, being globally shared?

Why do we choose and trust politicians to manage medical emergencies?"
2021-03-10 18:21:42,"Over the next few years it will be interesting to see  how Trump's administration is viewed as more details come to light.

I would not be surprised at all if the ""Deep State"" was the impetus for vaccine investments made early on."
2021-03-10 18:59:32,"Trump administration officials criticize Biden for taking credit for his accomplishments and criticizing the Trump administration. Isn't that what Trump did with regard to Obama, on steroids? What goes around comes around.

What Biden has done, far better than Trump, is to make sure the vaccine was not just produced, but that it also got into arms as expeditiously as possible. And he has repeatedly encouraged people to get vaccinated. Trump went through some of the motions of vaccine production, but he didn't seem to care whether anyone actually was vaccinated."
2021-03-10 19:27:22,"Folks don't seem to understand how management works, and the Times is no exception.  Management sets tone, direction and methodologies.  Yep, sometimes staff overcomes poor management, but long term the outcomes are bad.  We still aren't done and misteps by the Trump administration are still likely to cost us, more than the half million dead they already get credit for.

It takes a whole lot of both siderisms to look at the poor leadership of the Trump administration, the bad outcomes top to bottom, to pull out a, ""They did something too.""

History is not going to look at the Trump administration in a positive light.  Good thing we have the Times to do that.  A clear plan of action with leadership means a faster roll out, going way back.  Throwing some money at a problem with a few supplies never works.  You need a plan, one developed by experts.  The very folks Trump badmouthed and sidelined."
2021-03-10 19:46:23,Yes they helped so much. They were so organized and did everything they could to help. If you believe this I have a bridge in Brooklyn to sell you.
2021-03-10 20:11:05,"Stepping way, way back, it sure seems to me that one of the basic things going on here is that the Biden administration is better at working with big business than the Trump administration was.

Think about that one.

Trump's history has been to demand this and that from suppliers, and for it to be entirely on his terms.  Later on, he might even change his terms.

The Biden administration appears to have worked with these companies for an outcome that worked for everybody, more or less. Certainly, there was some compromise involved to make it happen and effort by both sides.

Now, think about that one.

When I read about various Republican politicians screaming about bipartisanship demands, it often boils down to nothing more than, ""You do exactly what we want with no compromise.  It's enough that we even deign to talk to you.""  How's that going to work?"
2021-03-10 19:55:48,"Dear NYT, stop with the phony ""balanced reporting"". The trump admin and republican enablers are entirely responsible for the covid disaster in the US. End stop. I would remind you that the trump admin did not authorize the defense production act for the vaccine. Nor did he accept the option of purchasing vaccines from Pfizer. At every step of the way the trump admin hindered both production and access.

BTW it was not ""The House"" who passed the relief bill. It was ""Democrats"" who passed the relief bill. I am so sick and tired of the mealy mouthed idiocy of this paper. It is one of the reasons why we all had to endure the trump years."

2021-03-10 16:39:23,"It is morally grotesque to have to find Trump in a headline that should belong entirely to Joe Biden.  Especially in a paper as reputable as The New York Times.

When it comes to Covid, Trump should be judged as nothing short of a mass murderer.  Think of the deaths he might have prevented had he simply acted on scientific fact; had he listened to experts; had he, most significantly of all perhaps, embraced an all-out mask mandate.

Shame on you for giving Trump even an iota of credit on this one, whatever ""the groundwork."""
2021-03-10 13:54:56,"Remember when trump* gave credit to Obama for his two terms of heavy lifting to get the economy going great again after the previous republiQan debacle? No. Me neither.

Mask wars, constant denial, blue state exclusion???"
2021-03-10 16:03:15,"Despite the yelling, it’s fair enough to say that in some ways, people in the last Administration helped push vaccine development. The financial incentives in Warp Speed, stupid as the name was, were useful when the program started five months after Pfizer and Moderna got going. 

But generally speaking, anything helpful got done by the people Trump screamed at—Fauci, as captain of the Deep State, and all those worker bees who hung in there with Trump’s cronies shoved into charge—and against a backdrop of massive denial, lying, attacks, incompetence and just plain confusion. 

And I’m enjoying the heck out of hearing Trumpists caterwaul about taking credit for their work, since they didn’t even wait for Inauguration Day to start screaming that they’d done anything good Obama ever did, and turned the failed economy around by magic."

I find it hard to give trump credit for anything."

All the factual data in the article point to tremendous upsurge in vaccine production due to Biden admin initiatives. And more importantly, there was virtually no logistics or distribution plan in place. Rationalizing and coordinating distribution and actually getting shots in arms is totally due to the efforts of Ron Klain (erstwhile Ebola czar) and team. Competence, experience and leadership matters. Grumbling notwithstanding, the previous administration was lacking in all three."
2021-03-10 18:11:14,"Balderdash! Pretend president Trump deserves no credit for vaccine development, distribution or administration to patients. He failed in every respect to protect us.  His lies and ineptitude resulted in an estimated 185,000 needless deaths."

Avoiding the conversation about the deliberate lies about Covid-19 that should color any review of the trump administration's pandemic response, the ""work"" described in this article attributed to the trump administration is threadbare at best.  The tangible improvements in vaccine production not attributable to Biden in the article (e.g. - usable dosages per vial) are not the result of the trump administration but  improvements in manufacturing that are to be expected by anyone even slightly familiar with this industry.  By contrast, getting pharma competitors to share IP to increase production is a real accomplishment that can be attributed to government work.

By all means, note the benefits that are accruing to Biden outside of his control, but don't randomly assign them as ""accomplishments"" to administrations because the thing occurred before or after 20 January 2021.  That is lazy, bad journalism that obscures what the government can meaningfully accomplish in this situation.

He never encouraged mask wearing, then exploited the schism. He failed to develop plans for mass vaccinations even as he boasted about Operation Warp Speed.  And he claimed credit for a vaccine (Pfizer's) that wasn't even part of Warp Speed.  You don't get credit for not solving a disaster that you created and perpetuated."

He and his wife were vaccinated in January, but not a word until recent leaks.

With half a million dead, Trump and his administration botched the pandemic horribly. It pains me to read comments about people who lost loved ones. The hurt they're feeling is very real. The previous administration didn't even meet the bar, they get zero credit."
2021-03-10 16:15:56,"This title is obscene.  Sure got me to read the article though........which must have been the point, other than making me furious.  He is a murderer.   The article is out of line..................WAY out of line. You don't get credit for failure to follow through.  Laying the ground work?  Others did that in the last days so it would look like they did SOMETHING.  He gets NO credit."
2021-03-10 17:19:50,"Funny, the NYT describes the rollout as “humming”.   I call it a slow-motion car crash from my prospect in California.  

As to credit for the vaccine we already know who stole 20 billion dollars to fund Operation Warp Speed and where the money came from.  It wasn’t Biden nor Congress.

Did the rollout really need to be this bad?"
2021-03-10 17:52:27,"This headline is so misleading. It does not capture the content of the article. If one glanced at it, one might think, “poor Trump is not getting the credit he deserves “. To be clear, Trump deserves credit for killing hundreds of thousands of Americans through his willful neglect and lack of any interest in utilizing his position as president to coordinate a robust response to a pandemic that he knew would be devastating back in January 2020. He has, at every turn, done the wrong thing, the neglectful thing, the destructive thing. Your readers’ outrage here is not something to brush off. Could it be possible that you are not giving Trump enough credit for killing Americans?"
2021-03-10 16:57:37,"Trump did nothing for the American people. He pushed production so he could grab all credit, pat himself on the back, accept lavish praise from his toadies, and then put no plan in place to distribute vaccine to the people. He was too busy trying to make Biden's job harder. Of course, he had time to take a vaccine for himself."
2021-03-10 18:33:35,Operation Warp Speed was a typical Trump Administration  F_UP!  Throw lots of money at a good idea with absolutely no working operations behind it.  Trump should be jail!
2021-03-10 20:20:37,"Any other president would have worked with
Big Pharma to accelerate vaccine production to equal success. The metric for the performance of the Trump administration is death rate per capital - total failure."
2021-03-10 20:44:04,"I detect a buried lede, here. Trump purposely refused to invoke the Defense Production Act to help Pfizer produce its vaccine sooner? How many people died because of Trump's childish pique?"
2021-03-10 19:58:58,"Never forget that Obama saved the country from a depression and handed over an economy in fine fiddle to Trump. Obama was too decent to crow about it while people were still hurting, something that never restrained Trump."
2021-03-10 19:31:16,"""With Trump's Help"" should have a question make after it?

Donald for his last 2 + months in office totally ignored the vaccine rollout. He only complained that vaccines were not approved until after the election...all about him, as usual."
2021-03-10 20:07:14,"Meanwhile, Canada, America's trade partner it won't trade with, suffers because it has to import vaccines from Europe and India instead of Michigan. That failure to respect the NAFTA economy (which located certain industries like pharma in the US and others in Canada) is on both Trump and Biden.  Locked-down Canadians waiting for vaccines while irresponsible Americans party on under their plentiful vaccine aegis will not soon forget."
2021-03-10 19:35:21,Least we forget Dr Fauci proclaimed a vaccine would not be developed until the fall of 2021 in spite of a layman like Trump it would be done by 2020. In March 2020 Fauci said masks offer NO protection against the virus. It seems If Trump followed the “science” we’d be still watching deaths rise.
2021-03-10 19:58:13,"If Trump were to get any credit for getting vaccines to Americans he would be all over the media touting the value of the vaccines and disclosing that he himself has been vaccinated, even though he had the virus.  Until he encourages Americans to get vaccinated he deserves no credit for anything related to the vaccines."
2021-03-10 20:38:10,"Biden and his team could not get information from the utterly resistant Trump team who delayed the normal process of brining the next president and his team on board and stayed resistant until they left. 

Biden had absolutely no choice but to be very cautious given no access to the actual information inside the Trump executive branch. 

It is not ""under-promising"" when you can't get any information from the existing team. It is rational and necessary behavior. 

By the way, the basic strategy for getting the vaccines into arms much faster than anyone had previously imagined was first stated and promised by Bill Gates, who pledged to fund building up to 7 production facilities in anticipation of a successful vaccine, so scale-up could be reduced by over a year. Both Trump and Biden have used the core concept of the Gates commitment (so Gates did not have to do so)."
2021-03-10 20:48:25,"You can’t break something, then try to find a way to fix it and expect credit; it was your mess from the start. The former guy deserves only to be remembered for the 530 thousands lives we lost, and the millions who lost their family members or their livelihoods. 
As for the vaccine’s discovery, that was the work of the scientists and doctors who worked tirelessly and deserve all our recognition and gratitude."
2021-03-10 19:34:23,"Am I missing something here? This was the ""the election was stolen"" and misinformation administration. Why would anyone pay ANY attention to what any Trump administration official says?"
2021-03-10 19:36:35,"So, out of curiosity, how many times did the Trump administration acknowledge the strong momentum of the economy throughout the second Obama administration?"
2021-03-10 20:04:08,Finally seeing the light at the end of a very bleak year. Thanks Joe.
2021-03-10 20:17:57,"Trump did not give any federal money to the first vaccine out of the chute: Pfizer BioNTech. None. He did label the race for the vaccine ""Warp Speed""--a catchy name taken from Star Trek--but he left the entire matter of distribution to the various states without federal input and he refused to try to charge up the manufacture of the vaccine with federal directives.

As I recall, Trump even refused to buy enough vaccines at the outset though Pfizer offered more twice.

And he never showed by precept and example that he thought Americans should even take the vaccine, given that he hid the fact that he was inoculated along with his wife.

That is not leadership on this in anyone's book."
2021-03-10 21:10:52,"If there was anything certain that Trump did during the pandemic, it was to make money. The consequences of helping people or getting things done were just side effects."
2021-03-10 16:13:30,Just another political wresting match on the back of a lethal pandemic.
2021-03-10 20:34:38,"I'd like to see Biden reach out to Trump and acknowledge his contributions -- and ask him to speak out to his followers and encourage them to get vaccinated.

2021-03-10 21:14:36,"The Trump administration did good things in facilitating vaccine development, but the actual infrastructure for mitigating covid overall was at best a D grade.

2021-03-10 21:28:53,"Wait a minute! I thought Trump was a “businessman”, and elected to the highest office in the land because he is a “businessman”?? Isn’t one of the basic lessons in sales (and therefore business) to “under-promise and over deliver”? This is basic sales practice 101. Trump is a reality TV star. He wouldn’t, and doesn’t, know the first thing about running “business”. Thank goodness we actually have competent individuals in the government once again!"

2021-03-10 21:15:07,"Sorry, this sounds like the former Trump administration personnel are just playing the refs here, complaining about the better press the new administration is getting.  It's my understanding that when the Biden people took over, the number of vaccine units available in the US had been vastly overstated by the previous administration, and not available for the states.  There was no plan in place, apparently, to get shots into arms."
2021-03-10 21:24:28,"It’s so nice to have a real President again. It’s amazing how much better government runs when the party in charge doesn’t have a core goal to keep the federal government as broken as possible, as it does when Republicans are running things."
2021-03-10 21:18:53,"Trumpies taking credit for the vaccines is kind of like saying, they called the fire department after allowing the house to burn."
2021-03-10 20:35:55,"Trump and sycophants denied the virus, mocked, masked, and held multiple super spreader political rallies, and now they want credit? 

Trump and crones are responsible for tens of thousands of unnecessary deaths. If we're going to thank anyone, let's thank the taxpayer who funded the vaccine and the scientists you came through despite Trump."
2021-03-10 22:04:41,"Trump lied about the seriousness of the disease, when he knew it was lethal -saying it was like a flu.  Then, he made wearing a mask a political statement instead of backing scientists trying to keep people safe and the virus at bay.  Then he refused to build a federal response, foisting all the hard work to the states and refusing to fund those efforts.  Then, as the body counts rose, he held non-masked rallies still refuting what science was telling people.  He suggested injecting people with bleach and using light somehow inside the body.  He bullied the scientists trying to tell people what to do, even on air during his covid briefings.  In the last several months of his administration, he did nothing but fume about the election and play golf.  And now, his admin wants credit????  They killed hundreds of thousands of people with their ridiculous refusal to tell Americans what was at stake and what to do.  No, I will not give them an ounce of credit for anything given the death toll that is clearly on their hands."
2021-03-10 20:31:26,"getting the vaccine produced as quickly as it was was not a statement of political will-it was in large part an outgrowth of faith in science. And, it was only the beginning-as if  putting in the foundation of a house 

The harder part was to get the vaccine delivered to those that needed it Despite the Grievance laden white male  drama queens of the Republican Party ,Pres Joe has done a world class job in delivering what was needed when it was needed.

Government works-but only if:
a. you believe it can
b. you not hinder it

2021-03-10 23:08:10,"The headline should have been, Biden got the vaccine rollout despite “that other fellow.” Trump who knows nothing and does not know he knows nothing and does not care, was out playing golf and at every opportunity telling folks the virus will miraculously disappear. Now after sheer incompetence, allowing the virus to engulf our country and 520,000 deaths and counting, he and his minions want credit? Well, I’ll tell you what? First let them account for their sheer incompetence, letting the virus do such devastation and tell the truth. President Biden and his team put the most competent group together and you see the incredible results. Competence, competence, competence, something Trump, his acolytes, his pretend and acting minions never learned nor knew how to practice."
2021-03-10 23:42:34,"""...With Trump's Help"" -- Please!

I remember hearing tapes of the Trump interviews with Bob Woodward.  Even when he knew of the lethal threat posed by the virus...""I play it down.  I always play it down.""

Trump -- throughout his campaign holding one rally after another before throngs of maskless supporters, ""We're rounding the turn!!!""

""With Trump's Help"" -- give me a break!

The legacy of Trump can be seen in actions of the Governors of Texas and Mississippi who will cause the unnecessary deaths of some of their state's residents by ending mask mandates too soon.  Their actions are the unfortunate by-product of Trump's defiance and ignorance."
2021-03-10 21:45:38,"My best friend lost his father and sister to Covid-19 during the fall of 2020. They weren’t able to visit them in the hospital or have a proper funeral service. The trauma is unbearable for my best friend, along with countless other families. 

What was Trump doing during that time? Trying to steal an election for a job he wasn’t capable / interested enough in doing. He was completely MIA for many months and then delayed the Operation Warp Speed handover to Biden. This is all easily accessible information. Let’s not pretend that he didn’t check out of his job...after prior months holding numerous super spreader events."
2021-03-10 22:28:52,"Trump did exactly nothing to help rid us of the virus.

On the contrary he did everything in his power to help spread it and succeeded mightily at the task.

Somebody somewhere in his employ came up with the phrase ""Operation Warp Speed"" and Trump resumed his consultations with The Proud Boys on how to get reelected."
2021-03-10 23:19:31,"As many, many commenters before me have noted, this article is inaccurate, disingenuous and slanted. 
We all lived through Trump's management of the vaccine rollout. It was politicized and incompetent. I would be embarrassed for the Times if it printed this piece as an op-ed; running it as a news story is simply shameful."
2021-03-10 22:58:43,"For the 100s off thousands of people who dies because of donald trump impoverished, wholelu self-seeking leadership, he should be tried and executed instead of being credited for any part of our pandemic response. Doing the minimum was not doing much."

We're dealing with anti-vaxxers
Who came from the anti-maskers
Who dismissed the COVID disaster
While med supplies were sought after
Because the virus was a hoax
Made a punchline through the jokes
Of the president who caught it
While the farm, he almost bought it, 
But did not repent or try to prevent
The anti-maskers or anti-vaxxers or truth hackers
Nurtured by the White House that Trump built."

But he left it on the kitchen table to spoil. 
Joe Biden found, saved, and brought it to the wedding.

Trump can cry me a river but it does not change his failure."
2021-03-10 22:24:41,"This article is a classic example of The Times spitting the baby. The fact is that under Trump’s “leadership” vaccine production was falling off a cliff and the states, left to their own devices were flailing around. Federal leadership was desperately needed and when team Biden arrived they provided it and then some.  I shudder to think of what the state of the pandemic would be in this country if the election had gone the other way."
2021-03-10 22:07:29,"Let's not forget how much the vengeful petty Trump did to inhibit the handoff of power to Biden.  All of this cost valuable time and organization when it came to distributing and injecting the vaccines.  I will give operation warp speed credit for incentivizing the development of these wonderful vaccines, but Trump and his administration deserve no further credit beyond that."
2021-03-10 22:42:58,"Biden could have had an opportunity here to be a uniter. He could have credited the Trump admin for it's job while highlighting his own actions too. He could have even offered to invite Trump to join him while touring one of the medical centers, which Trump would have refused, which would make Trump look petty, while making Biden seem like the more mature ""adult in the room"". Biden has had so many golden opportunities, in a short amount of time, to govern in bipartisan manner, and he has wasted EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THEM. It's sad cause I know a lot of Republicans who believed his campaign promise to govern in a bipartisan manner. Biden had, and to a certain extent still has, an opportunity to be a healer in chief, but he's running out of time, and fast. 

First impressions in the first 100 days often carry through for all of a President's term(s). So far Biden is acting more like former Presidents who just ram through their wishlists on party line votes. This is fine if your majorities are secure. His are NOT. And by ramming everything through on party lines, he is building up no good will with Republicans, and when the time comes that he truly needs Rs to enact his policies, there'll be no good will for him to take advantage of. And he'll have no one to blame but himself. For the sake of the country, I hope he course corrects soon"
2021-03-10 22:00:53,This is not(or should not be )about taking credit. This is a worldwide catastrophe and everyone needed(needs) to be on their best game and high alert till we see this through. Period.
2021-03-10 22:22:03,"Gee , after attacking and stymieing Obama for eight years Trump takes over and the economy stays exactly on the same positive trend line that Obama put it on in the middle of the Great Recession, did Obama get one once of credit?"
2021-03-10 22:11:14,"Looking at Biden and the last 5 Presidents, the data is clear:

Democratic Presidents are more competent in governing than the Republican ones. 

It is not that the Democratic Presidents are geniuses while the Republican Presidents are not. The Republicans come to the office despising Government, and having promised their voters to take Government out of more things, they focus on just that. 

If what we want is *competence in governing* then we would never vote for Republican Presidents. Apparently we have other priorities in this country for our government than governing."
2021-03-10 22:04:16,"Yeah, yeah. Just like trump claimed credit for the robust economy that Obama-Biden brought back from the cliff edge in 2009 and continued to nurture throughout their tenure in the WH."
2021-03-10 22:34:17,"What planet are you living on? Trump left no records regarding the Covid for Biden; he discouraged people; he told lies about alternative cures; my state had no vaccines until Biden became president. As far as I can recall, the only people getting vaccines were health and essential workers. Biden has changed the narrative to one that respects science and follows up with making sure supplies are going out to the states. Trump as president didn't get the vaccine to show it was safe to his loyal followers. As a result of Trump's anti-scientific stance on masks and vaccines, many people go about without either and may get sick and infect others. Yes, he got Pfizer and Moderna working but his message was always the opposite -- like real men don't wear masks or get vaccines. I agree with Max below."
2021-03-10 21:54:50,"The hypocrisy of Trumpists continues. I lost count of the number of times Trump criticised the Obama regime. Whether it was for their immigration, trade, international relations or economic policies,  Trump blamed Obama for everything.

Trump's approach was to over promise and then under deliver. He down played everything. ""Its not a issue as we have it under control"". ""The virus is simply going to disappear"". ""The virus will be gone by Easter"" (thats 2020).

And where did this incompetent approach get the USA?

Biden so far has delivered. 
Sure, of course, The Trump administration put some things in place. Many things. But ultimately Trump failed to sufficiently coordinate the Federal Government to control the pandemic. He left the country in tatters with DC looking like Mogadishu or Kabul."
2021-03-10 21:57:49,"Cannot bring myself to excuse the horrendous leadership of no.45 to render a fair appraisal. Stalling on information, lying to the public, denying the virus , refusing to supply federal organization and abandoning  states to their own efforts,  failing to enact defense production to aid in vaccine. If he would have spent a fraction of the time he spent golfing, tweeting, inventing three word chants, spray tanning, on a national pandemic, our trajectory would look completely different,  thousands of deaths as a direct result of his incompetence may have been alleviated.
 
So no. He does not get credit for anything in my eyes, and there are over 500,000 people that would probably agree with me if they could."
2021-03-10 21:55:34,"This is an attempt to establish a false equivalence between the two administrations. Trump downplayed the virus and failed to take measures to reduce its transmission. He refused to acknowledge Biden’s legitimacy, including withholding funds and access necessary for a successsful transition—-including access needed for managing the vaccination process. In each instance, Trump elevated his emotional instability over citizen safety. 

Any actions that facilitated the vaccine occurred due to civil servants Trump denigrated or debased. 

The two administrations are not similar and cannot be compared."

2021-03-11 00:56:00,"Typical Florida man thinking... he wants all the praise for his “actions,” but can’t take the criticism for the toll he inflicted by his inaction that cost hundreds of thousands of lives. 

And, in truth, the only reason the vaccine operation was of any use was he stayed out of the way. Rather, he was kept out of the way. 

If he had done the same with entire pandemic effort (stayed out of the limelight, kept his mouth shut, nodded his head when appropriate, and handed the mic over to the public health officials), he very well might have easily won re-election (shudder). 

Might as well ask the leopard to get rid is it’s spots."
2021-03-11 01:16:41,"Trump denied the virulence of this deadly virus. Trump also did less than the bare minimum to get the vaccine rolled out. He made no credible plan for distribution. 

Trump is also responsible for the hideous division in our country, which has led to mask and protections denying right-wingers who coughed in people's faces rather than helping their neighbors. Even today, Trump hold-outs are opening their states and counties too soon. We will have a 4th wave now, and more thousands of Americans will die that shouldn't have to, because of Republicans. Trump and his supporters are responsible for at least half of the 500,000 Americans now dead of covid, because of his/their stupidity, profound ineptitude and denials.

ANY POTUS would have put the wheels in motion to stem the viral spread, (as well as the spread of hatred), and would have brought Americans together much better than the Trump administration did. The fact is, America would be much further along on the road to getting back to normal if Trump had not been president. I, for one, will never give him credit for anything but a half-million Americans who perished on his watch, nor will I forgive him."

Lest you forget that he was a science denier, and did absolutely nothing to stem the deaths of well over 500,000 Americans including my Mother-in-law. Biden and his administration are solely responsible for the excellent progress of getting vaccines to the American public. While Trump sulked about losing the election, Biden got to work immediately. Please so not misrepresent the facts and mislead your readers. I expect better researched articles NYT writers."

Trump lied about the threat of the pandemic from the very start, lied about the need for testing, and lied about basic precautions that could have saved thousands of lives. Trump lied about effective precautions and promoted bogus cures. Trump singlehandedly created a climate where something as simple and effective as mask wearing is now politicized. Trump and his enablers specifically targeted blue states in denying life-saving resources. Trump left the incoming Biden administration with *no* vaccination plan in place, focusing instead on overthrowing an election. How dare you write such a misleading and fraudulent headline! The Biden administration deserves *full* credit for what they've accomplish *in spite* of Trump's malfeasance. Shame on you for your continuing attempts to play both sides and buoy a monster whose criminal negligence will forever live in infamy."

2021-03-11 02:57:23,"Your analysis is truly superficial without addressing ""a wanna be dictator's"" mind set. If Trump truly wanted to address the Covid-19 pandemic, he could have enacted the Defense Production Act many months ago and we could have saved many lives. The trials and production of vaccines are the natural courses of profit driven companies and the desire of satisfying consumers needs. Trump had nothing to do with the sucess of vaccine research. He even ignored science. 

Biden, on the other hand, activated the DPA to ramp up the vaccine production, and he deserves the credit of saving lives and serving the public."
2021-03-11 03:31:45,"The headline writing in this publication is an abomination and it is inexcusable. ""With Trump's Help?"" Seriously? There's a difference between the President and the administration/government, you dig? Melding the two helped turn the Presidency into a personality cult in the first place. Does the article mention one thing that Trump himself did? No, it doesn't. Not a single thing.

I don't expect or need to be validated, I want the news media to be skeptical of the Biden administration, & I appreciate that the Trump _administration_ didn't screw up vaccine development like they screwed up so many other things, but this is just god-awful journalism, I think I might use it in class as an object lesson in what not to do. If the headline writing doesn't match the story, you've committed malpractice. It's clearly intentional, it makes your writers look incompetent or malign, and it is a disservice to the reader. It's manifestly obvious that the NYT takes weak pieces and sexes them up as clickbait. It works - I just spent a few minutes venting in this comment box. But all this venting is toxic to the nation's political culture, and you just don't give a darn. You just don't."
2021-03-11 03:30:24,"Let's stop with the gaslighting. On 12/7/20 The Times own reporting said Biden got the Vaccine rolling DESPITE Trump:

""Despite repeated warnings from Pfizer officials that demand could vastly outstrip supply and amid urges to pre-order more doses, the Trump administration turned down the offer, according to several people familiar with the discussions.""

So did Stat News on Jan 31:

""Top Trump officials actively lobbied Congress to deny state governments any extra funding for the Covid-19 vaccine rollout last fall — despite frantic warnings from state officials that they didn’t have the money they needed to ramp up a massive vaccination operation.
[...]
Without the extra money, states spent last October and November rationing the small pot of federal dollars they had been given. And when vaccines began shipping in December, states seemed woefully underprepared."
2021-03-09 12:37:15,"I spent about ten consecutive night in the wee-hours of 11:45 am until 3 am scouring articles and websites to figure out how it worked in my area back in January. I was able to get appointments for my household.  We all had our second shots about two weeks ago.  First exhalations in what feels like a year.  

I shared with other friends and neighbors, yep, one couple even scored spilled doses.  I know I am directly responsible for getting at least four households vaccinated.  They include seniors, African-Americans, 1As, 1Bs, essential workers, teachers, and grandparents.

2021-03-09 13:08:43,"The response to this pandemic has been haphazard since day 1. The fact that the US farmed out our vaccination efforts to private entities (all with their own websites) and rural county health departments boggles the mind. Our county health department employs five people. They have been inundated due to vaccine scheduling. A better approach would have been local mass vaccination days set up via the National Guard. And, using the National Guard would mean there could be one vaccine scheduling website per state. Obtaining a life-saving vaccine in one of the wealthiest nations in the world shouldn’t be akin to winning the lottery."
2021-03-09 13:19:49,"When I heard volunteers were getting leftovers, I signed up right away.  Turned out I LOVED working the mass vaccination sites, and have done 4 now - and hauled in 11 of my friends to help, as well!  We're ALL vaccinated now, way ahead of when we would have been."
2021-03-09 13:31:21,What about the second dose? Are those who show up for the extras given an appointment for the second or do they have to go through the same process? Does that not create a risk that the first shot may be wasted anyway?
2021-03-09 13:36:56,"I tried this this a.m.  The registration form omits age for some reason, so if you aren't an essential worker or first responder or lack serious underlying conditions, it won't capture eligibility.  In other words, it won't work for seniors.

Something needs to, because we are getting left out in the cold while younger, faster folks are snapping up available appointments."
2021-03-09 13:52:47,"We’re playing the Vaccine Hunger Games down here in FL.  As aid, a local FB page helps spread info about vaccination sites, including those waiving restrictions at the end of the day to put precious leftover doses into the arms of people instead of the trash can. Many people who did not meet the state guidelines, eg teachers under the age of 50, or anyone aged 30 , were able to receive these leftover doses. Anyone meeting guidelines was prioritized, but every remaining dose was administered to SOMEONE. 
Yesterday these sites received word that they must stop this practice and DISCARD these leftover doses. Ron DeSantis would rather waste these precious doses than have citizens vaccinated. He likes to claim that people “don’t want” the vaccine because they aren’t showing up. If you only open a site from 9-5 in an area where citizens are economically challenged, how many of those people can skip work to get a vaccine? Or spend hours online to set up an appointment? I guess he needs data to support his decision early on to send 12,000 doses to his voter base in Palm Beach Co, and 900 doses to the poorest neighborhoods in Jacksonville."
2021-03-09 13:53:16,"So wait, there are only 2 vaccine sites ""testing the program"" and a waitlist of 200 other providers trying to join? Across the whole country? That's it?!

What is this site waiting for in terms of approving these providers? At this rate, everyone will be eligible for a regular app't anyway.

I registered yesterday after a friend posted on Facebook, assuming this thing was up and running and there were multiple possibilities in my area alone. Sounds like a lot of hype over nothing."
2021-03-09 13:53:54,"For those who are offered a last-minute vaccine, “that person should not say no because they want it to go to someone else.”

Those aren’t your only two options. If you are finding out about extra doses because you have the right social connections, then you can be intentional about making sure that information goes to people who lack connections. The word-of-mouth system is guaranteed to produce disparities and to get vaccines to the people least likely to need them: those with access to private vehicles, with constant internet connections, with jobs that don’t produce wage losses if you drop everything and rush off to wait in line. For me, being intentional about using my social connections has meant forwarding word-of-mouth alerts about vaccine availability to people who can quickly act on that information in low-income communities and communities of color. This includes friends who can quickly translate a text message into Spanish and pastors in Black churches. 

I’m not proposing that individuals can fix a broken system in this way. But too many people are treating the word-of-mouth system as though it comes with no moral obligations or any reason to ask hard questions of ourselves."

All sites need to be more low tech and easier to access.  Think of an aged person living alone with little technical or internet knowledge and set the sites up to benefit them.  THIS SHOULDN'T BE THIS HARD!!!"

2021-03-09 12:29:56,"I hope the pandemic has revealed what a terrible health system we have. It shouldn’t be this complicated to get vaccines to your population. Older and marginalized populations are being asked to use a lot of technology they aren’t familiar with and ultimately losing out to those who can navigate this system themselves or have the support system in place to help. I know this just from signing up family members—and these are people who have jobs WFH, internet etc. Even if they use zoom for work, our system is so convoluted they don’t know where to sign up and how to get vaccines the same way younger populations know due to how we access information. Anyway, once we get these early adopters vaccinated, it’s going to be an uphill battle getting the rest of the country onboard."

2021-03-09 13:53:57,"There is widespread recognition (I believe) that many things that could be simple are made complicated in our large, technologically “advanced” society.

Examples that come to my mind immediately are income tax calculation and communicating with physicians’ offices.  For many of us, the wondrous devices we use to connect to each other (“smart” phones, computers and tablets) or to bring news, arts and entertainment into our homes offer frustration and security hassles along with their benefits.

So to deal promptly and well with an epidemic, we need to create and test the pieces of the vaccination system to ensure they are robust, accessible AND USABLE by all.

Unfortunately, this requires considerable time and resources to set up and “debug”, after a public health system has been starved for long periods.  Which commonly happens in between epidemics.

And will likely require a universal data exchange standard that breaks the barrier to data transfer between different proprietary “healthcare” systems. 

Perhaps the new generation of “UX” (user experience) technologists will make technology truly friendly even for the least “sophisticated” of us.

Stephen Rinsler, MD"
2021-03-09 15:52:30,Leftover doses will become more and more of a problem as the number of vaccination sites increases.
2021-03-09 16:09:31,"sounds like a great service, but this like so many efforts to make things easier on us is flawed before it even starts.   It truly fills gaps in sign up protocols for a vaccine, but necessitates the user having a computer/smart phone, reliable internet access, flexibility I. schedule to make an appointment, and reliable transportation to that vaccine.  Maybe systems and protocols made to help society should start with our weakest members, and then build out from there??"
2021-03-09 16:17:31,"The big drawback to getting an ""extra"" is you aren't guaranteed a second dose in a timely manner. 

Of course with J&J one dose that won't be an issue so that's good news.

With the two dose vaccines I would be reluctant to go the ""extra"" route myself.

Of course for me it is moot as I got dose 2 last week so my view on this may be skewed and perhaps I'd be willing to gamble given even one dose of Moderna or Pfizer appears roughly as effective as J&J 60 days out or so if I couldn't get a legit appointment. 

Hopefully this situation will improve and our problem will become convincing the reluctant, not supplying the desperately willing who have to make getting a shot a full time job."
2021-03-09 16:31:29,"So, the reality, from what I've seen volunteering at a vaccine clinic is the extra doses are going to volunteers, friends and relatives of the medical staff working at the clinic, and random people who happen to walk in asking for a dose at just the right time.  There's so much work to get shots in arms that the overhead of searching for people in a database, calling them up, etc, is not a good use of time.  Within 60 days I think anyone who wants a vaccine will be able to get one."

This is EXACTLY what happened to my next door neighbor.  She was coming home from work one night and stopped by the drug store chain close to her house.  While she was searching the aisles for something to munch on, the pharmacist called out her, asking if she had the vaccine and if not, if she would like one, like right now.

She looked around, perplexed by such a offer.  She immediately jumped on it, thanking the pharmacist profusely for asking.

I seem to come across more and more folks who have received this vaccine more by chance than by open appointments on line any where!!!

Thank you to ALL pharmacists who call out to customers nearing the evening hours who happen to have left over vaccines to give out.

I think I'm going to start hanging out at some of these drug stores in the evening. . . my on-line luck of scoring an appt. has been zero for weeks."

2021-03-09 17:21:00,"I have a close friend who works for a hospital system and has been tasked with managing vaccine rollout. He asked me if I wanted to be added to their ""volunteer list"" for leftover vaccines. I am 36, am not an essential worker and am healthy (as far as I know), so I felt ethically inclined to say thanks but no thanks. He reached out a week later and said he added me to this list anyway, because they had to throw out vaccines the prior day and they had exhausted their volunteer list. So if they call me it will be because they are about to throw out a vaccine and have exhausted the ""eligible"" people on their list. I still don't feel great accepting the vaccine under this circumstance but my ethics tell me I should accept the vaccine rather than let it be thrown out. 

All that being said, there is clearly a need for a better, or more equitable system for distributing these leftover vaccines."
2021-03-09 17:23:29,"An example of arranging to get vaccinated:

When someone I know brought his elderly relative for their second vaccine shot 8 days ago, he asked the vaccine clinic supervisor if there was a surplus shot that he could receive though he was not yet quite in the target age group for the vaccine. 

She replied that none would be available that day, but that he could stop by in two days at a certain time in the afternoon and there would be the possibility of getting a surplus shot.

He followed the supervisor's suggestion and there was excess vaccine when he was at the clinic two day's later. He received his first shot."

I don't have the technical wherewithal to design a system like Dr. B's, but I managed to set up my own ad hoc system to monitor vaccination-slot availability at providers within a 150-mile radius for folks who need it – including seniors who lack internet and/or cell phone access.

I would, however, note a commonality in most of the vaccination no-shows, from the perspective of someone who's now set them up at dozens of providers: there's literally no way to cancel, or even reschedule, appointments at many of them. I understand the reasons why – many lack the manpower to answer phoned-in inquiries, and plenty of others have no online presence, period, other than maybe a Facebook page (and thus lack any online appointment-booking functionality) – but still.

It seems like Dr. B & others like him would be less needed if some providers could figure out a way to incorporate such a feature (even via text message – a number of healthcare providers use such systems)."

2021-03-09 17:53:20,"Back in late January - when every vaccine website was indicating there were no appointments available - I called one of those small, inner-city clinics in the borough in which I live -  one which primarily serves the local Black and Latinx community - to see if the had any appointments available -

Not surprisingly - they told me there was nothing available - but they could add my name to their waiting list - which I agreed to do -

That was late on a Friday afternoon -

On Monday morning - they called me at around 11:30 AM and asked if I could come in right away - because they had a few extra doses available -

I got myself over there and - after a simple intake process - received my first vaccination -

They gave me an appointment for my second shot - which I received about two weeks ago -

My wife - who is younger than I - had her name added to the waiting list as soon as she became eligible -

Last Friday they called her at around 4:30 PM and asked if she could come in ""right now"" for her first shot -

She ran over to the clinic and received her first vaccination - returning with an appointment for her second dose -

I have friends who have received their shots - while others - like the 91-year-old woman who lives in the lower apartment in our building - have been unable to receive a much-needed vaccination - it makes no sense -

And - in case you're worried - we were able to make an appointment for our 91-year-old neighbor - and we will escort her there and back..."

Larger providers have made it clear in ads but I keep hearing, by word-of-mouth, of smaller clinics that we can go to. By-word-of-mouth??? That is a horrible way to distribute vaccinations.

Pretty much everyone I know has found ways to “jump the line” for their shots. So many people have told me that I can get a vaccine if I go to a specific shot clinic, or line up at any shot clinic for leftover doses, or sing up as a clinic volunteer, etc. But when I check in this advice, it’s never true. Websites for clinic volunteers stress that there is no vaccination guaranteed for you if you sign up, and they even say you won’t get leftover doses. Shot clinics say they don’t have leftover doses these days because things are more organized than  they were at the start of the vaccine effort. I don’t know who to believe. But I am a rule follower, so I will just wait for my turn, I guess."

I agree with commenters who say this should not have to be left in the hands of private entrepreneurs. There needs to be a centralized reservation system, including a waiting list.  Airlines, travel websites, and Telecharge have systems that have figured this out.  Perhaps they could be leveraged in some way to benefit public health.

The most important thing is that we need to get going on this now, for next time.  Because there will be a next time, whether it be for the COVID vaccine boosters needed to accommodate new strains, or normal seasonal flu shots.  Not to mention new viruses.  The toothpaste is out of the tube."

In this story, I thought I finally saw something different.  In his photo, Daren Nelson is looking toward, not away from, his vaccine provider.  Alas, on second look, it was when she was putting on a bandaid after the shot.  (And yes, I, too, looked away when getting my life-saving vaccine)."
2021-03-09 13:16:55,"The system in CT has worked so well that I wish every state used it.  Early on, CT established a more equitable system for the general public, based it entirely on age.  This was done after essential like hospital workers had been vaccinated.  They recently added teachers and TA and paras as a new push, but the age-only criteria for everyone else is simple and easy.  Best part is that you know when you qualify.  

Once sign up began, I found several online signup sites and our local government sent me a notice as well.  Vaccinations were available at numerous large sites were set up to accommodate, none more than 20 minutes away.  The signup process was a relief.  Vaccinations, start-to-finish took less than an hour."

Here in the UK the norm is that you wait to be called for Covid19-vaccination, and you are according to your demographic and vaccine availability. We are all in an invisible mass-queue, but know that our turn will come.

We do not have to respond to announcements or rumours to queue speculatively, until the doses run out. Or sign up with (one of) the local doctors that has secured a reliable supply.

We can pick and chose our GP, but don't have to shop around for specialists to access directly... because we can't, unless we pay them privately. Where there is a choice, it's mediated through agreeing who the GP refers to."

Unfortunately, the line was a mile long ( I came half an hour early) and we were waiting standing outside in a pouring cold rain for more than 35 min. The wait inside the building was equally long. It could not be very healthy for some seniors to wait in such conditions, especially in a wheelchair. Next day I received another CDC invitation online to sign up for the second dose. However, no slot was available after 3 weeks. Five days later such slots appeared and I was able to sign up again. I called Virginia Department of Health to inform them about my CDC vaccinations, but they were not interested in correcting their list."
2021-03-09 19:32:55,"I am a public librarian. Our public library was forced to open on 01 May 2020. I am not 65 and therefore do not qualify for a vaccine. I have cancer and my oncologist told me to please get the vaccine if possible. I went to Alabama's vaccine website. They do not consider cancer patients in the list of criteria. So I have been waiting alone.

My public library is in a very rural area. Our county health department has had sporadic drive through events of which I do not qualify. We have a small Walmart but it does have a pharmacy but no vaccines. I live 25 miles from the nearest town in another county. My cancer treatments are in a different town about 35 miles away. The hospital there has daily drive through events but again, I do not qualify by Alabama's rules. I want to cry when I turn away from the vaccine line to get to my cancer treatment.

I have people come in my library every day without a mask. I provide them for free. If they do not take the mask, I ask them to leave. I had to threaten to call the police when a patron refused to wear the mask or leave.

Now I ponder, which gets me first, the virus or the cancer."
2021-03-09 19:38:52,"Vaccine should have been allocated on first come first basis to cover more ground and get more people vaccinated. With categories such as Phase I and Phase IB, we have young and healthy people lying and cutting the line while elderly people are still waiting for a call from their physician. Most elderly people who are not computer savvy and cannot drive really far to get vaccinated are left helpless and in the meantime many hospitals are throwing away vaccines when there are ""no shows"""

2021-03-09 19:47:31,Given what a hassle it has been to secure an appointment here in Washington State I hope that Dr.B. is successful and can be implemented across the US. The roll out of the vaccine has been embarrassing and points to the failure of our for profit health care system.
2021-03-09 19:50:31,"I have a 68-year-old relative who still has been unable to sign up for a vaccine in New York. I’ve been trying to help, sitting in front of the NYS website hitting “refresh” throughout the day, but still unsuccessful. He lives on Long Island, which has long had the highest positivity rate in New York, but seems to be far short on available vaccine distribution sites. 
Not ideal when access to a life-saving vaccine depends on your location and ability to navigate a sign-up process that is like a lottery tilted in favor of the technically proficient."
2021-03-09 19:58:02,"For profit company?  Entrepreneurs?  For a cautionary tale, google ""Philly Fighting Covid"" about a major city's failure to vet perhaps well-intentioned enterprises that later fell flat on their faces.  Who knows where our birthdates, addresses, cell phone numbers, pre-existing health conditions went after we all fell for it out of desperation?  The last administration's failure to match their support of vaccine development with concurrent vaccine distribution planning was criminal, and now we have to rely on start-ups to show the way.  Just nuts.  I wish the Biden administration godspeed."
2021-03-09 19:58:17,"Unfortunately, I can attest to the media reports about how awful the New York vaccination website is.  I don't have a language problem and have WIFI access.  And yet I found the website insanely clumsy and confusing when trying to make an appointment for my 79-year old mother, who does not speak English and does not know how to use a computer.  Imagine those immigrants who don't have WIFI and someone who is fluent enough to help navigate the websites.  Also, the lower income populations tend not to be connected with the group of doctors/hospitals who are sending out emails about vaccine availability and registration info.  It is really sad and unfortunately I don't see this App as helping to reach these challenged groups."
2021-03-09 20:05:34,"There are Twitter and FB groups which purportedly are there to help people know when and where there are openings.  But it is my observation they are part of the problem.  

They direct hordes of people to the same site at the same time, effectively shutting out most of them.  The hordes are crashing the sites and sometimes multibooking and trying to transfer to friends and family.  It would be nice if these sites were banned.  Most of what I see are people saying it was fully booked the minute it opened, with the occasional success story to keep people engaged with the page or account."
2021-03-09 20:41:48,"In the article, Dr. B states that they have collected personal information from many people but do not state how many people they have gotten vaccines for. Since this firm states that it is for profit, I would be wary about giving them personal information that could be sold to third parties."
2021-03-09 21:01:11,"The fairest and easiest way to distribute the vaccine would have been a birthday-based lottery. It would be so much simpler to just say on the news each day ""if your birthday is July 17th, it's your turn today"". Any other system requires you to actively decide who is the most deserving of life. As someone who is, according to ""the line"", least deserving of life, I do not respect ""the line"" and plan to jump it the first chance I get."
2021-03-09 21:07:17,"New Jersey opened up to all in January, essentially. 16 to 64 eligible with certain underlying medical conditions including smokers in addition to medical personnel in 1A. There are Facebook and Twitter sites that assist the vaccine chase. I registered my 84 and 87 year old parents, my 79 and 84 year old aunt and uncle and have assisted 8 others in the over 75 age group get appointments. The state system is in complete disarray. The megasite in Moorestown has two different ways to attempt to get vaccine - register through Virtua or call Virtua. They don't use state registry. I called on behalf of a senior and got an appointment. She had previously registered online with Virtua in February. Never heard from them from online registration. It's awful."
2021-03-09 21:26:49,"We know that people of color are at far greater risk.  I propose that any person of color be allowed to receive a shot as soon as the first line workers and elderly are vaccinated.  My SIL is at higher risk with multiple medical conditions and is a POC.  As a healthy 73 yr old, I would have preferred he go ahead of me.  Let’s just open it up to this high risk group."
2021-03-09 21:29:13,"I will be 65 in 28 days, have a number of comorbidities and cannot find a place to get vaccinated. Most of the websites don't work well and the ones that do do not have appointments availability.   I should have that I live in California in one of the most expensive counties in the US."
2021-03-09 21:35:19,"While or Department o Health sends me ""updates"" in which it congratulates itself for efficiency in vaccinating NM's people, I sit at home, un-vaccinated, despite being in a priority group. Meanwhile, the buddies of my college-aged son report they have ""gamed the system"" and are out socializing because they've had the vaccine. 

I don't begrudge anyone their rightful place in the line for vaccination, but the number of line-jumpers seems appallingly high. Articles touting ""work-arounds"" only make the system seem more random, as the framework rules for eligibility gets thrown out the window.

It's too bad that the prior guy, and his administration, denied that the virus was real, and ignored the work needed to plan a massive vaccine campaign (etc.). Of course, they were then first in line when the vaccine became available."

I am part of what I guess has become in the most disposable group: under 65, in moderate good health yet no idea whatsoever when the government will decide my life is worth protecting. Enough with the “vulnerable” approach. By the time the last obese, heavy smoking person gets the shot and my turn comes around, the economy will be in shambles because those of us needed to get the country going are sick or still waiting.

2021-03-09 18:47:16,"It is really interesting and upsetting to see  how people react so negatively to this new website. The ultimate goal of this website is to prevent leftover doses from going wasted. They are not helping people to skip the line/ bypass anyone who needs the vaccine more. Look, you only have 15 mins to react - it tells how little time they have until the shots are expired. 2) I am pretty sure if there are people waiting outside the clinics to get the leftover shots, they will give them the priority. 3) leftover doses (not manufacturing the doses) is a huge problem right now in this country - obviously there have been serious hurdles for healthcare providers to give all the doses to people in need. This is a great solution to mitigate the problem-I really dont understand why people think it is ‘unfair’. This country’s med field is very advanced, but their systems are super disorganised. The government has not done much on that - a company came out and tried to help and has been faced with criticism. Really? People nowadays like to call out others too soon, too naively. The company even tried to reach out to the latinos and black people first in order to get the doses to them who have been severely impacted. Of course, this website is not gonna solve the whole problem, but why are we to judge baselessly when someone tries to do good? This is why it takes ages to push forward any polices in this country."
2021-03-09 19:36:36,"It's great that someone has developed this system.

As previously noted, I've not included the positions of the Pacific Islands.  

Why are we #1 and #2?  Because we have tough Democratic governor who has followed science and isn't afraid of some random wacky tweet.  She was NM Secretary of Health from 2004 to 2007.  She has also relied upon the expertise of our current Secretary of Department of Health and Human Services to inform and guide her decisions, lockdowns, openings, and communications with the public.

Has she angered some New Mexicans?  Most certainly.  Have they still been lining up for their vaccines? Most likely.

The eligibility criteria should should not solely be based on the individual. The health risks to a person’s household members should be taken into account, too.

As a result, I’m on every waiting list I can find. I’ve learned which pharmacies often do have spare doses near closing time and I call them every day. I’m ready to drop everything and drive an hour if a last-minute dose becomes available.

To the CDC thanks for nothing.  Another year or two of mask wearing and social distancing and then I will probably be in heaven.  I wonder if they are wearing masks there."
2021-03-09 15:32:00,"I'm very disappointed with the CDC's ultra-cautious statement. Where is data suggesting that a decent-sized percentage of  fully vaccinated persons remain contagious such that they might exude a viral load sufficient to infect others?  Was this an issue with post-polio vaccinations?   Can the CDC offer any examples of a large percentage of post-vaccinated persons presenting a genuine threat to others? Why should vaccinated people constrain themselves to small groups and not larger festive outings? I'm waiting for data to answer this question. 

It's understandable that for a period of time vaccinated persons will have to wear masks in public places since their vaccination status won't be readily apparent.  At some point soon, there will be two groups:  those who have been vaccinated and those who have studiously avoided vaccination. As to the latter, they are owed no intrusive precautions taken by the former."
2021-03-09 15:34:15,"It would be helpful if the CDC would develop a straight forward matrix of most every social situation including haircuts, restaurants, concerts, theatre, sporting events, churches, schools, etc and which ones vaccinated folks can safely attend.

Also, where are those OSHA guidelines for businesses that President Biden ordered OSHA to create?

Still too many unanswered questions.

Just once, I’d like to see guidelines that are complete, inclusive, straight forward and easy to understand."
2021-03-09 15:35:38,"I have fully supported masks, social distancing, etc. to save lives, especially of the most vulnerable.￼ But if society can’t get back to normal after being vaccinated, what’s the point of being vaccinated? If vaccination is not effective, then it seems like we don’t have any thing that is, and the  goal and purpose of social distancing measures is to slow the rate of transmission so that our healthcare system is not overwhelmed. We can’t live like this forever.￼"
2021-03-09 15:48:53,"I am delighted to be two weeks past my second vaccination.  I will celebrate by going to a supermarket for the first time in a year.
But I will still be wearing a mask when I go out.... I do not want to scare other people!"
2021-03-09 15:50:34,"It is my impression that when one is vaccinated with the MMR, the tetanus, pertussis (whooping cough), and diphtheria vaccine that vaccinated persons were not only protected from the disease (would not become sick with it) or would be able to still pass the disease to others.
Prime example.  Grandparents were encouraged to get the whooping cough shot before they visited new grandchild.  Whooping cough is still prevalent in the United States.  (That vaccine tends to decline after years and then disease can occur.  Once the grandparents were vaccinated they could visit their grandchild.  No masks, No social distancing.

Why is this vaccine so different that people who are vaccinated can still catch the disease and pass it on to others?  

Have wondered about this for months.  Wish someone would ask the CDC about this.  
It's either a vaccine or it isn't.  Just causing a lesser disease while worthy, is not a vaccine."
2021-03-09 15:50:58,"Nah. I’ll just wait till the summer when we’ve all been vaccinated. Trusting science requires a lot of reading. When you read, you come to realize that a lot of Covid information is doled out in ways and at times for other reasons besides just disseminating the facts. The economy, people’s mental states, politics, motivation to open schools, trying to rally excitement for vaccine uptake, etc. I can be patient, and from what I’ve read—the best advice is really just to wait until everyone has been offered the vaccine."
2021-03-09 15:56:33,"It's a good start, but the research on transmission by vaccinated adults needs to be fast-tracked. It's taking too long for the results, and COVID fatigue is running rampant (such as the recent frat-party riots in Boulder). If the vaccine-hesitant see that vaccination is a Get of Jail Free card, they're much more likely to get a shot."
2021-03-09 15:58:54,"Recall the adage: “The journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step.” This is that step. We will return to some kind of maskless normal at some point, but this is not yet the point. In the meanwhile, in the words of the old William de Vaughn record, “Be thankful for what you’ve got,” and let’s behave accordingly. The “new normal” will no doubt be somewhat different than the old one, but if we all pitch in for the common good, it will come sooner rather than later."
2021-03-09 16:02:34,"We need to still be cautious. 

CBC.CA just reported that there's a new outbreak in a B.C. care home where residents and staff were already vaccinated.

'The illness seems to be milder and doesn't transmit as much,' Dr. Bonnie Henry says."
2021-03-09 16:04:46,"I appreciate this ""start small"" advice from the CDC.  It certainly makes total sense.

But the dilemma my husband and I face aren't the small gatherings with family and friends who HAVE been vaccinated, but with those various members who have been adamant from the beginning in not believing in masking, social distancing nor vaccines.

Until the deadly virus is more under control (less cases and deaths) and vaccines are widely available for anyone who wishes one, not unlike the flu shot, we will continue to wear our face masks, keep a healthy distance and limit our gatherings to a few, out doors especially now that the weather is FINALLY beginning to break.

I frankly don't see this ""rather be safe than sick"" policy ending any time soon.  I do not agree with people who do not believe in these series of precautions, but at the same time, I will not cut them out of my life, only enjoy their company from a very safe distance for as long as it takes."
2021-03-09 16:10:20,"""Fully vaccinated people can have small gatherings indoors with other vaccinated people…"" 

Yesterday’s headline above, frightens me…

Now, friends and families are advised they can have gatherings with those who have been vaccinated. Does this mean I can expect friends, family, employers…to freely inquire whether or not I have been vaccinated? Isn’t that my personal – and very private – business?

Is this the opening salvo to a deepening of the divide between us? Will I be prevented from entering a movie theater? Made to sit in a separate section of my doctor’s office or on public transportation? Will I be unable to board a plane to visit my daughter?

I am not anti-vax. Full stop. I religiously wear my mask – believe everyone should - and I socially distance. My heart breaks for those who have died and their families; my deepest respect and appreciation for all those on the front lines.

And...I have a powerful and consistently effective immune system that has provided me excellent health for 60 years. Will I be pressured – socially or governmentally forced - to get a vaccine? 

Science cannot tell me that I will be immune from the virus or whether more vaccines will be necessary as variants emerge. 

Science does tell me that the vaccine will alter how my immune system works. The government and the media tell me that I must get a vaccine out of consideration for others.

Caution, maturity, wisdom and an unwillingness to stand in fear tell me be safe, but also…to wait."
2021-03-09 16:12:40,"I wouldn't get too smug about being vaccinated, an extended care seniors home in Calgary has just had a major outbreak with dozens of new cases, every staff member and resident has had double shots of the vaccine."
2021-03-09 16:15:00,"I’m no scientist and I’ve been a true believer in masks and distancing and no travel. However I’m just beginning to get an little feeling that things are looking up! I think it’s might be likely ok for vaccinated to give up masks and distancing practicality for good, but that would mean that they could be challenged by others in public (where masking is the norm.) This could be tough, especially if it causes and argument or worry! I’m also thinking that the variants just might not be so dire to us. However I’ve been so wrong about everything! Hey - the sun is out today and I’m feeling optimistic for the first time in a year!"
2021-03-09 14:54:20,"Sorry, CDC: as a biologist, I want to see the  immunological data, the release of which feckless governments worldwide should have demanded before purchasing vaccines.  Writers other than myself have opined that although the vaccines may convey personal protection, they might not also convey good social protection.  

Note  the CDC's language about  individuals resuming activities ""at low risk to themselves,"" no mention of  risk to un-vaccinated  others.   Absent from the adjudication are the specifics of the cellular/molecular immunological response—which, again, are unavailable.  This, in itself is idiotic; to then have agencies like the CDC make recommendations without that revealed data is doubly absurd."
2021-03-09 15:17:28,"If the mask requirement is lifted, many, many people who are not vaccinated, AKA Trump Republicans, will pass the CV around again.   We need to wait until most of the population is vaccinated.   Doing anything else will kill more people."
2021-03-09 15:18:08,Hoping the CDC will soon issue guidelines that allow for the creation of ‘vaccine passports” so those of us who are vaccinated will be able to travel & dine in restaurants together as well.
2021-03-09 15:05:07,"I'm a physician and have been dealing with Covid since Day 1. I feel strongly that the CDC is dropping the ball on post vaccination guidance. They are increasing vaccination hesitancy and worse, people are just discarding the CDCs advice altogether, because they are not being aggressive enough in allowing people to resume their normal lives post vaccination. I'm especially disappointed in Dr. Fauci as he went through the HIV epidemic and knows that a harm reduction model, not abstinence, is the best way to decrease risk and increase compliance in the general population. So, get vaccinated, wait 2 weeks after the second shot with the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines and 4 weeks after the J&J shot, and other than complying with masking where required by law, live your life like it's 1999!  And if anyone gives you a hard time tell them that data from Israel and the UK shows a near 90% (!) decrease in transmissibility of Covid. The bottom line is that continued post vaccination hysteria is just as dangerous as Covid denialism. They are 2 sides of the same coin."

2021-03-09 15:48:24,"Following the CDC guidelines nationally is the prudent thing to do. But then again, Texas' Abbott, mimicking famous James Dean (rebel without a cause), decided, against all reason and common sense and solidarity towards the least among us, to trample on a mask recommendation. This confirms Einstein's dictum, that 'stupidity knows no limits'. Let's hope those of us cautious enough of the consequences of a 'wild west' misbehavior, are wrong, that the disregard -by not using face masks in public- of sensible norms won't prolong the 'killings' by this tiny monster called coronavirus (that knows not republican from democrat, white from Black, poor from rich). Let's stop being this Trumpian, the absurd ""me me me"" narcissism of feeling privileged and entitled."
2021-03-09 16:26:45,"Today there's alarming local news. An outbreak of covid-19 is in progress in a BC care home in which all of the residents and staff have been vaccinated with Pfizer's vaccine -- many, but not all, having received both doses. Public health authorities are rushing to say the cases ""seem to be milder"" than those experienced in care homes before, but there's no benchmark for this. I think there's little doubt Big Pharma and governments have over-sold the impact of vaccines. The prime directive is to get the economy moving. Expect further outbreaks and even clusters of deaths to be downplayed or ignored entirely; the authorities want people to think its all over and we can all get back to work (and consuming like mad). The big difference will likely be the seasonal decline in virulence as spring and summer settle in, not vaccination. Meanwhile, England reports people's behaviour worsens as vaccination rates go up. That's no surprise. We're a ways from being out of these woods yet."
2021-03-09 16:43:50,"Thanks for this timely CDC guidance. My friends and I are starting to wonder what benefits of being vaccinated bring. For weeks we have been told even after vaccination the masks stay on, maintain social distancing, no guarantee of resistance to COVID or transmission to others, don't know how long the vaccination effect lasts, no compensation if anything goes wrong, etc. So this news is encouraging. There may be a glimmer of hope at the end of the tunnel."
2021-03-09 18:35:40,"Dr Fauci said we’d be wearing masks through 2022.  I’m on board with that even though within two weeks I’ll be fully vaccinated. The citizens across the Pacific have it right!  Wear masks all the time during cold and flu season.  One huge benefit of this requirement now is avoiding all those annoying upper respiratory illnesses we usually get every year.  As an increasingly crowded and social society, I believe we should alter our view of masks as temporary and see them as a great tool for a future of better health for everyone."
2021-03-09 17:15:31,"This smacks of the Biden Administration giving up. We have no idea how long immunity lasts, and we know vaccinated people can still transmit the virus. So saying once one is vaccinated they can go around without a make is endangering unvaccinated people. Saying people don’t need to quarantine or get tested after being exposed to a person with covid is beyond ridiculous. The vaccine doesn’t stop one from contracting and spreading the virus. It just keep the vaccinated person out of the hospital.

I predict a Trump 2024 win after this nonsense."
2021-03-09 16:34:54,"Gatherings never stopped for us. We have become a very gullible and sad society when we look to big brother for permission to pursue our God granted rights. The govt does not grant rights, but they sure like taking them away."
2021-03-09 20:29:26,"While some vaccinated people are rushing to travel, I find myself very emotionally hesitant to go back to ""normal"" life even though I got my second shot three weeks ago. Having trained myself well, I can't get rid of pandemic anxiety and agoraphobia so easily. The challenge for me will be to see the outside world and strangers as safe again. It will take a little time."
2021-03-09 20:58:25,"Is it really so difficult to continue wearing masks to protect others as well as yourself?  As a senior senior who has been vaccinated I will continue to mask up and if the mandate is lifted I will safely go back into quarantine rather than face the risk of being with unvaccinated people.  Just continue the masks for a few months longer and distancing so the virus will be controlled.  Too many antivaxers around who still feel that they do not have to consider anyone else.  We saw recently the spread of measles that was initially thought ended.   If you don’t want to vaccinate then stay away from others.  The numbers are still there, so let’s take the safe way......the country is far far from being safe for everyone especially the lower wage workers who have to do their jobs......so we are able to stay safe.    They should be recognized for the essential workers they have proved to be.  Let’s get them vaccinated too before we lose even more of them to this virus."

2021-03-09 14:48:16,"Excellent article, but the safe wait period for those who receive the single dose J&J vaccine is a month not two weeks. This is important enough that a correction should be published."
2021-03-09 16:25:38,"This is a very irresponsible, oversimplified title that easily could lead people astray and into endangering behavior.

2021-03-09 18:46:06,"According to  David Leonhardt in ""No ‘Covid Zero,’ but Normalcy"", for those vaccinated, the risk of serious illness from influenza is more than 40x greater than that from COVID. Given that, why shouldn't vaccinated people have ""medium sized gatherings""—or even large ones?

If the need to stay ""small"" is true for COVID, then it must be 40x more urgent for influenza—so will we be receiving CDC guidance to avoid gatherings until we discover and immunize everyone with an influenza vaccine with near-100% protection from hospitalization?

Of course not—that's why in Israel, they're opening stadiums for concerts. But here in the US, our experts are full of caution and anxiety and telling us to ""start small"". 

This sort of unscientific superstition and absurd advice is why people don't trust the CDC."
2021-03-09 18:53:14,"The C.D.C. needs to recommend to FDA to delay the requirement of the 2nd dose of the Pfizer and Moderna vaccine to 6 months following the 1st dose when it will serve as a booster rather than a 2 dose regimen of questionable long-term protection. With the single dose Johnson and Johnson vaccine already being deployed following the authorization from the FDA is more likely to be preferred. 

Delaying the 2nd dose of the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines will instantly double the immediate supply of vaccines to meet the demand and have more individuals of all ages receive it so that there will be 2X as few people harboring COVID and spreading it. This will be consistent with vaccines against other deadly viruses. The recommended schedule for the vaccine against hepatitis B virus is to receive the first shot, followed in one month by the second shot. Six months following the first shot, one should receive the 3rd and final shot of the series.

The C.D.C.'s long-awaited advice for gatherings of immunized people is fine but it will be no match to universal immunization with at least a single dose of 1 of the 3 FDA authorized vaccines against COVID administered to all US residents of all ages, willing to receive it. The vaccines developed in 2020 by the WARP SPEED program are the best bet to boot the menacing rascal COVID out of the USA. Common sense safety advice of the C.D.C. could serve for preparedness against the next airborne viral pandemic while HIV and HCV pandemic are around."

2021-03-09 12:36:21,"Humans are such social beings (granted individual variation in how much interaction we want)! The “content” part of school has never been the favorite part for most students. This year has been so difficult, disappointing, lonely. Teachers have worked in superhuman fashion for a whole year to try to convey some social and emotional energy mediated by screens. Some kids have enjoyed some of it. Some have scarcely coped. Parents, especially mothers, have despaired. Some students have thrived by being shielded from bullying, racism, anxiety, even lack of sleep. But the joy we see conveyed in these students’ stories is undeniable. Still, along with so many others, I’m wishing for an improved “normal” as we tiptoe back into the world."
2021-03-09 13:04:42,"Thank you for giving kids the opportunity to voice how they have dealt with the pandemic, schooling, their feelings.  

As a grandmother I have worried about kids, the affects of this so totally different way of life.  Aside from the loss of lives throughout this past year, it is the kids that I’ve thought of, and a lot.  

We have all had our opinions, worries, trials.  But please be supportive in how we can  comfort and rally our young people!  They need us!  We are their steadfast and we need to try to understand their needs now.  How can we accommodate?  

Amazing thing I noted. In these photos - all the kids were wearing masks!  They really are smarter than many adults!  They are leading the way.  They are our models if we just acknowledge and support them, in many ways."

You keep recycling the erroneous idea that we public school teachers worked fully remotely until December.  It’s just wrong.  Why does this misinformation persist in your coverage.  
I know, I did it, I teach second grade in a public school in Manhattan.  
It’s true there was negotiation and a delayed start in September 2020.  But that is when we opened this year."

My daughter and I have shared that responsibility. She and I both have advanced degrees in education and see the downsides. But we also appreciate the giant upside... Our little guys have been safe throughout a fraught and uncertain time. The old expectations need to be modified for this most difficult time. Just surviving has been an accomplishment for all our families. We can catch up with some school skills later and the socializing difficulties will be a shared experience one day that bonds a generation.  Being so young now, my grandsons are likely to not remember much about this time later in their lives. Except that they went to Nani's house instead of school. And maybe that they couldn't go to Bounce Around. Knowing vaccinations are happening now helps us all to get through to a time when we can socialize again. In the meantime, kudos to all the kids -- they've endured a worldwide catastrophe with grace and perseverance and maturity."
2021-03-09 13:23:28,"I love that one student’s school is playing a movie/show during lunch. Speaking without a mask produces more aerosols than breathing. This is my main hesitancy about in- person school. My children will be allowed to talk while eating in classrooms, cafeteria, and auditorium. “They need to be able to socialize,” their principals said when I expressed concern. That may be fine for outside lunch, but inside lunch, talking, without masks, especially for my teenager? Ugh. Would love to hear from anyone whose child is attending in person school with lunch. What is your school doing to ensure safety at lunch? Is your school even serving lunch?"

Our students have an option to do class virtual through our school of innovation campus.  They can also choose a blended schedule (T/T in class or MWF in class with virtual the other days).

The so-called leadership in New York has made a mess of opening, closing,opening, closing schools. They've kowtowed to the unions and have prevented children and young adults from receiving their rightful education. The students who are hurt the most are minority students. I speak from 31 years of teaching experience seeing the adults in administration and the unions saying over and over, ""It's for the students."" It was never for the students, it was about them."

The single largest post pandemic hurdle we face is the human cost of lives lost and lives interrupted as a result of the pandemic.  The return to normalcy will be long, difficult, and expensive.  No other investment of time, money, and resources is as valuable as our young people, and the adults must set aside their political wishes and ideas to make this happen.  The future of America can only occur with a recovery that must include all kids everywhere.  Thank you for a wonderful, hopeful, and painful article."

2021-03-09 14:59:21,"I struggle with anger over the schools being closed  for a year. The only upside I can see is that I do not think we will ever again tolerate such a thing. The children have acted with tremendous grace and poise and are to be commended. 

 I am also concerned that children’s lives will continue to be restricted even as adults who have been vaccinated are able to begin to have more freedoms. We must prioritize our youth, they’ve spent a year sacrificing for those of us who are much higher risk than they are. We must continue to look for ways to make it up to them. The future is Bright with such wonderful young people in it."

2021-03-09 16:52:45,"Thanks for this article. My kindergartener will be returning to school after this spring break, after having been home since last spring break. I'm worried, and excited, and he is too. 

It's bittersweet time. I know there are a lot of things he missed out on by being remote for a year. He's in a dual-language school, so he missed a year of Spanish immersion. He's really outgoing, so he missed being around lots of kids.

At the same time, I see a lot that he's gained in this year. 

He's learned how to use a laptop mostly independently, and had lots of time to follow what catches his imagination -- he's basically teaching himself multiplication from YouTube Kids, he follows us around the house reciting space facts, and he has invented all sorts of paper crafts to express his interests. He plays on his swing and throws a ball for our dogs, and he and the neighbor kids play outside with their scooters and chalk. 

Not to mention, this is the longest he has been home with his parents in his whole life. His father and I both work, so he has gone to day care or school full-time since he was 3 months old, and it makes me wonder if that was such a good idea either. 

It's hard going from this ""new normal"" to the next ""new normal"" and wondering when our ""normals"" will stop shifting so much. Luckily kids are (mostly) better at it than adults."
2021-03-09 16:38:57,"My reading of this article suggests that the in-person classes are less than half full.  Most parents – if they can – are still keeping their children at home.  I’m doing the same.  Yes, in school is better when it really is in school.  Yes, some students are suffering or doing poorly.  But some students are doing fine, and some are thriving. For some, the lack of distractions from others has given the opportunity for some to learn how to concentrate – perhaps they will be better students when they do return.  

One neighbor is sending  her daughter back to school next week when our district reopens because her daughter needs to re-learn how to turn in assignments on time.  However, she is keeping her two sons at home.

Only 23% of my daughter’s 6th grade is returning to in-person school next week. To the politicians and others, please stop talking about sending the children back – you’re giving them excuses not to perform and also creating conflict within families  - we have enough on our plates without your “help.”  

Rather, work on getting the vaccine out to everyone.  Work on the ventilation systems within the school buildings as this will help keep our students safe from many diseases.  Work on making high-speed broadband available for everyone.  

No one is happy about what is happening right now, but let’s support the choice to stay at home. If I as a single parent gets sick – my daughter has more issues than remote learning going forward."
2021-03-09 17:34:49,Loved reading this article. It made me feel the way I felt when I got my vaccine. Hopeful.
2021-03-09 17:47:58,"Nice article — good to hear from students.  Far too much writing and pontificating about education happens without appreciating or even including their voices and insights.  Even little ones, as this article shows, have lots to contribute and make good observations.

Policymakers and education researchers — and reformers pushing Big Data, testing, accountability solutions — need to take heed and learn from the students.  We'd have much better schools and much better learning and personal, social, and democratic development."
2021-03-09 17:39:42,"My child has been in school full-time for months without incident. Has any country in the world been as dramatically unequal as ours in the approaches to reopening schools this year? When will elected officials face accountability for the instructional time that children were denied, with no evidence-based public health rationale for it?"
2021-03-09 17:44:49,"Great idea for an article, I think it could have been strengthened by being more truly in the words of the students with direct quotes / photos from their smartphones and less narration."
2021-03-09 18:09:17,"Once again, teachers and schoolworkers are invisible."
2021-03-09 18:12:56,Elementary school children in NYC started in September not December which is what might be inferred by reading this article.
2021-03-09 18:31:46,"While not mentioned in the article, are many school districts planning Summer programs to help students catch up, and to continue to socialize with their peers? Teachers could get extra pay, and their children could attend a separate program at the parent’s school... even if they aren’t in the same age bracket that school usually serves.

While the logistics wouldn’t be simple, it’s worth considering."
2021-03-09 18:41:06,"All Chicago schools closed last March. 
In September, all public schools stayed closed and all Catholic schools opened. 

Every day, my grandkids walked past the closed public school to their open Catholic school, my grandkids couldn’t understand why.  I can’t understand either. 

But at least the public schools are opening now."
2021-03-09 18:23:43,"If the previous administration hadn’t spent a full year lying about the pandemic we wouldn’t be in this situation now. In a rush to open everything they made the problem worse and extended the pain and suffering by a magnitude of at least ten. Ending the lines of transmission is the only way to Stop the pandemic and the previous administration did the opposite by extending the lines of transmission to 30 million Americans and so it continues. Unfortunately the morons in charge of the ‘red stares’ are making e very same mistakes all Over again with their idiotic policies that amount to Lather, rinse repeat."
2021-03-09 18:40:59,"Even though my 10th grade daughter longs, and needs for her emotional and mental health, to go back to school, I doubt if her school will reopen. Her class of 500+ in a school of 3000+ does not have the facilities to accommodate six feet apart classes. Plus, the district in their shortsightedness, made many teachers take early retirement. Thus, most classes that physically could only be a max of 32 have 40 to 60 students online. This is one of the reasons my daughter hates online and her grades has plummeted this year. I pray next year we go back to normal classroom, maybe with masks, but without distant requirements."
2021-03-09 19:41:54,"I find it a bit ironic that a lot of the vitriol I see directed at schools (not all, certainly, but...) comes from the same crowd that resists masks, resists social distancing, etc. 

If we had actually taken this pandemic seriously from the beginning, had ANY decent leadership for 3/4 of last year, or even were taking it consistently seriously now, these wouldn't be issues."
2021-03-09 19:24:53,This is one of the saddest and most unfortunate articles I have read for some time. I think when we look back ten years from now we will regret keeping these young children out of school for so long. Children were the the least likely to develop severe illness from COVID and yet somehow ended up being affected by the most restrictive policies. Teachers could have been the hero’s of this pandemic but chose instead to hide behind their computers and “teach” for 3 hours per day while maintaining their same salary and benefits as if this were equivalent to in-person learning. Teacher’s like to call themselves frontline workers in order to jump the vaccination line while real frontline workers who have been working in-person from day one in underserved communities are still waiting for theirs. I know every district is different but our experience with our school district this year has been miserable and our teachers union still has not come to an agreement with the board. We continue with distance learning for our youngest most important citizens while adults who have been vaccinated can now socialize without social distancing or masking per the CDC. How does that make any sense?
2021-03-09 20:06:11,The kids interviewed sound like a very thoughtful bunch.They seem more aware of the risks and issues than many people in the general public. I hope the return to school remains positive and healthy for all of them.
2021-03-09 20:41:36,Going back would be a great idea if we actually met the criteria set by the cdc for reopening but we don’t. It’s very frustrating to see people who note correctly that we have failed to prioritize schools and yet at the same time insist that schools are basically safe. They’re probably safe for me and my kids but they will contribute to spread and deaths among the most vulnerable. I guess that’s a sacrifice our society has always been too willing to make. Nothing too new here.
2021-03-09 20:57:45,"As a public school teacher in a major city, students really had and have to adjust not working in-class and not being around their classmates. It is a long and tedious process of online learning and everyone within the school system is struggling. 

This is the first time in modern history when kids are actually anxious to come to school instead of staying at home to play video games. Covid has shown us how a distraction can ruin family traditions, special moments, and gatherings. 

The summer before Covid, my family and I  were planning our family reunion and we were in the early process of putting the money together. We haven't had a family reunion in almost 20 years. Many people within the family have passed on; including my mother, children have graduated, babies have been born etc.

Covid has messed plans up for all families; and just as important taken people from families through death; like my pastor in Louisiana. IF things get back to normal, we won't regret the normality again; I just hope when the time comes, we do celebrate but not too much to endanger others."
2021-03-09 21:03:50,"I teach high school and have a daughter in high school, so I read this with interest.

Although these return to school stories are overwhelmingly positive and paint a picture of students who are joyfully and safely learning in person, the entire system of safety rests on the fact, hidden in the details, that most kids are NOT returning to school.

I teach five classes a day, and I'm lucky that in my English classes I have a maximum of 32-34 students (I know some districts have it worse). If we do a split hybrid system and everyone returns, I'm going to have 16-17 kids in the room at a time, in a room where only two tiny windows crack open.

The only way for my students to return safely, in my view, is if most of them DON'T return. It feels crazy to think that, but I think it's the truth.

As a teacher, I do not know how I'm going to teach online AND in person and be effective. I know I'm meeting some kids' needs better than others, and it's a constant struggle, and I keep trying, and I find some success but always want more (success meeting my students' needs and educational objectives, success supporting their mental health, and more). But if I have a handful in person and the rest online, I fear that I will be able to reach fewer of them, not more of them.

I don't have solutions right now. There are no easy answers. But it's clear to me that the success of safe in person instruction rests on many students not returning."
2021-03-09 22:01:25,Thank u for this beautiful article about our precious school students. It's unimaginable how the various school age kids have coped thru this Pandemic year in so many ways. My heart goes out to them as well as their parents and their teachers. All heros. Just like when I got my first dose of the Pfizer Vaccine a couple of weeks ago-suddenly I was filled w relief & emotion that perhaps after a year we're finally going to begin getting our lives back w our family & friends.
2021-03-09 22:38:24,"I’m very angry at the people behind ‘open the schools right now, no matter what’. What began as mostly a small, innocent group of parents and students who missed their friends, wanted to see their teachers and wanted to play sports was quickly taken over by right-wing Trump supporters who found a new pet project. Suddenly these simple protests turned very ugly, and those of us in smaller communities immediately recognized the local troublemakers at Trump rallies were the people at these school reopening rallies. Gone were the students, letter jackets and school mascots to get our community motivated again. 

As long as these right-wing Trump people stand here and scream to reopen schools and businesses that put us employees as sitting ducks because none of us have been vaccinated, I know they couldn’t care less about any of this."
2021-03-10 01:50:45,"I wonder how school reopenings would have played out if teachers were payed more for teaching in-person than virtual.

We should be compensating teachers based on the service they provide; in-person teaching is vastly more valuable to students than virtual instruction.

If teachers had something to gain from going back, they likely wouldn't obstruct reopenings as they do now."
2021-03-10 05:08:01,"So glad to see kids back in school. I cannot believe we have kept public schools closed so long, especially as private schools have been open basically the entire pandemic with very few issues."
2021-03-08 13:04:28,"This article illustrates how grinding poverty maintains an unbroken cycle throughout generations, further exacerbated by forces, such as a pandemic, that no poor family can control. 

Why do I feel that it is likely evitable the young bride's new baby will also not be completing his studies some day, just like his mother?"
2021-03-08 12:59:51,"“What happened to Sapana in a small town in Nepal is happening to girls across the developing world.”

Not happening in “the entire developing world.” It’s happening in the segments of the developing world where women, in extension girls, are already treated as second class citizens. As shown in the example of countries cited in the article, India, Nepal, Bangladesh etc. Missing in the example of are countries in the developing world such as, Vietnam, South Korea, Sri Lanka and the like, where education is the number one priority in the families, for the girls as well as boys, as the way out of the economic hardships they often inherits.

This story shows gender discrimination at work in its fundamental form and should be dealt with as such. As we take human rights violations into consideration when we give aids to developing nations how nations treat their young women should be part of the equation. How long can the civilized world turn a blind eye to see the aspirations of millions of girls turned into sexual bondages (let’s call the spade what it is) that literally brings them an early death as shown in this timely report."
2021-03-08 13:41:27,"I have to agree with the first statement made by the first commenter. The lead example is not ""child marriage.""  Child marriage is best understood as marriage of a person (almost always a woman) as a result of coercion and a decision being made by an adult on behalf of the child. 

I think this story does a disservice by its conflation of economic factors with violent coercion. It risks taking the spotlight away from the very sad, never ok and deplorable marrying of child brides (usually under 16) to adult men against the will of the child. This is what needs to be addressed by an international law making it illegal and punishable by prison and the marriage dissolvable upon entry into a country which properly understands this as rape and child abuse."
2021-03-08 16:34:34,I don’t understand why the work that is being done to help stop child marriages can’t shift to help women continue to get an education after they are married? Seems like a lot of women get married and have children 16-20... their lives aren’t over (I’m not saying it isn’t young and they still aren’t child) They can still learn and do other things. The system of education just needs to be shifted AS well.
2021-03-08 17:47:49,"While we try to make advances on these issues please can we (the developed world including the U.S.) start funding birth control in developing nations? I’m tired of the fact that conservatives in the U.S. have made this not possible. 

And yes agreement with all posters that marriage should not necessarily prevent completion of one’s education (particularly if there are ways to avoid pregnancy). 

I think the child marriage issue will take longer to prevent, but delaying pregnancy and completing one’s education for this generation would go a long way to reducing child marriage in the next generation."
2021-03-08 17:21:32,"The article stated that this young woman's family name was withheld to protect her privacy. Then, a few paragraphs later, her father's surname is used.
This seems silly."
2021-03-08 15:29:19,"The phrase ""child marriage"" makes me envision a forced union contrived by the girl's parents. The examples in this story are not that. They're of young people rushing into marriage, presumably of their own free will. Not great, but not quite as bad as backwards parents forcing 12-year old girls into a dangerous and adult situation."
2021-03-08 16:04:08,"I trekked in Nepal several years ago and observed that there appears to be a lack of support to have smaller families and birth control. Why are these people who barely survive having 5-6 children? Just because you marry doesn’t mean you have to have children. Yes, perhaps it’s a cultural thing but cultures can change if it benefits the community."
2021-03-08 17:01:33,"Governments of poor countries ought to pay ordinary families to keep their children, and in particular their daughters, single and in school.  Unfortunately, politicians (mostly male) would rather spend their limited budgets on the security services or political graft, or a combination of both."
2021-03-08 14:37:10,"Why does marriage have to end a woman's education and ambitions?  Raising children is all-consuming, certainly, but with modern birth control there's no reason those like Sapana, who choose to marry early, could not continue their studies and establish careers first.  Such arrangements are common in the western world, where waiting to marry is more about taking time to explore and develop emotional maturity."
2021-03-08 19:01:27,"Child marriages are still legal in several US states!  In so called developing world, poverty is the main reason for a lot of these problems.  When people have no money, girls end up bearing the brunt.  If the same girl gets a good education, then she helps herself, her family and future family!  Many foreign entities focus of conversion instead of helping people with education for its own sake.  Why should any human being convert to a foreign faith as a price for an education? So there are lots of reasons why girls lives are messed up because families, communities, countries and the West that wants to help don't address basic needs!'"
2021-03-08 15:50:39,"From the article's lead-in following the headline: ""The pandemic has worsened economic distress and other factors that lead to such unions.""

No, the pandemic has not worsened economic distress. What has worsened economic distress are the lockdown policies of governments which have created global economic  disruptions."
2021-03-08 16:23:23,"It seems to me that this sad reality , has to be approached by several remedies, in this case the article describes there was no coercion  the young woman saw this as an option out of poverty and a situation exacerbated by covid . What the world and society should do, is help such women continue their studies even after getting married, it is possible a lot of money is spent without thoughtful planning . Child care, different forms of schooling and yes changing the laws to prevent undesired, rape like marriages between under age women and much older men. The US as a leader should help and be an example for other countries, should address this issue inside our country as well ;and certainly in the countries mentioned in the article. The fact that it has been going on for ages is really sad ,let's hope that articles like this, and a better engagement in helping women around the world !
 on this March 8 INTERNATIONAL WOMEN'S DAY  will resonate stronger and move governments to more real and  meaningful action and changes !"
2021-03-08 15:27:05,"The legal definition of ""child marriage"" may be under 18, but a 17-year-old who has a child at 18 is not a 13-year-old."
2021-03-08 16:01:40,"What a bizarre choice for the lead story. It's a 17 year old who married another (assumedly) young person that they loved.  That's not child marriage by any stretch of the imagination. The problems of child marriage come from young girls, usually preteen or around that age, being married off to much older men against their will. Not from young lovebirds marrying in less than perfect circumstances.  

My grandfather fought nazis at 17, along with many other, as this article would suggest, """"""children"""""". Ridiculous."
2021-03-09 01:14:07,I remember trekking through a mountain village in Nepal in the 1970s. There was a wedding party going on and our guide explained the bride and groom were 7 and 8 years old. It was apparently a common cultural practice marrying children and they would only live together when they reached their teens. When I returned a couple of years ago there were a lot more schools so hopefully post pandemic the numbers will continue to reduce.

I don't buy many prepared foods, just the basics like pasta, rice, tortillas, beans, vegetables, and fruit. I comparison shop at two stores too. And I never, ever waste food. I eat it all.

I do eat mostly organic foods though and grass-fed chicken (though not much). Maybe that is why I'm spending more than every person in this story? I am pretty healthy though and I'd prefer to pay the farmer than the doctor, so I continue to pay more for food, apparently, than many of my fellow Americans.

And when I garden, which I do, it is more for enjoyment than food. The squirrels get a lot of the food. And the water bill goes up.

I'd like to see these folks' grocery receipts."

2021-03-07 21:52:59,"These ""Typical"" families consist of a lot of first world problems. Cutting back on wants vs. needs, but I guess NYT didn't want to depress readers by showing families that really cannot afford needs. An IT guy who is 65 is not likely to find a job; nobody wants to hire someone who they know has one foot out the door with retirement plans; sorry, but that is the way it is."

2021-03-07 22:29:18,"I'm writing as the earliest comments are posted, and already the tone is coming across as harsh and judgmental. We seem to know how to tell others how to save or spend their money - something that frequently happens to those who are receiving some type of aid. I applaud the individuals featured in this story, and appreciate that they allowed us readers into their personal lives. I am sorry for your losses -- of loved ones, of time spent with loved ones, of dreams, and of jobs. As someone who was hit and scared by past economic tumults,  I know that this too shall pass.

In the before times, I did a lot of traveling and I went to a lot of concerts, often out of town.  My rationale was that I wasn’t getting any younger, and I wanted to do as much as I could while I was still able.  When I couldn’t do either for months, it hit me how expensive it was.  My finances are so much better now.  Will I go back to the traveling and shows when it’s safe?  Honestly, yes but I think I’ll be more aware of costs and will curtail it somewhat.  Last summer I’d planned to go to Europe.  I ended up driving to Colorado.  It cost a third as much and I had a fabulous time!"
2021-03-07 22:06:15,"When I was a small child, this country was at the start of the post-World War II. People had habits of frugality and saving. It looses up as people’s wealth accumulated. I would expect the same after this pandemic. Republicans always take the glass half full view of affluence being supported by miserliness and capital instead of restoring demand that supports growth. So they favor policies that eviscerate demand by preserving money held by investors rather than enabling the unemployed to avoid poverty."
2021-03-07 22:13:25,"Each of these stories presented some aspect of my own pandemic life. the focus on necessities along with the small grace notes that varied from person to person. Last week when a tire company checked the pressure on a low tire on my 2011 car, offered at no charge good for them, we discovered I needed new tires. I went from a free pumping air into the tire to a new set of tires that cost nearly 900 bucks. I splurged 99 dollars on a replacement guarantee in case one of the tires gets too badly damaged to repair. That was one of my grace notes.

And then my thoughts go to Congress. Forget Democrat or Republican or Independent for a minute. Congress as an organization sure seemed mighty happy to offer a tax windfall to those who did not need the money. And now they're begrudging people a decent minimum wage and cutting pandemic unemployment by a hundred bucks a week. Please show me one member of Congress to whom a hundred bucks a week means anything.

Part of the Congressional rationale is that if unemployment is too high, people won't want to work. At the same time Congress refuses to raise the minimum wage. 

When one faces the economic realities described in the article by Ms Bernard, one can easily understand the unrest and division within our nation. I wish I could set the prevailing minimum wage for each member of Congress who did not support the full Biden measure of economic compassion and require that they live on the result for their entire tenure in Congress."
2021-03-07 22:15:33,"I'm glad the author assembled a racially and ethnically diverse sample of households. However, I see very little economic diversity -- four out of five (80%) own their own homes, yet the US home ownership rate is only 66%. So I didn't learn anything new from seeing how these people -- most of whom I'd consider affluent -- have navigated the pandemic. 

Here's me. I'm retired on a fixed income, living in a rented apartment. My income hasn't changed over the past year, but neither has the amount I spend each month. I no longer have a gym membership, and I rarely spend money in restaurants & cafes any more, so that's money saved. But I've been spending the equivalent on additional groceries, household supplies, fitness equipment, home improvement, and home entertainment. (My weekly grocery spending is about $125, and I haven't gained any weight in years.)"
2021-03-07 23:04:25,"I was very lucky as my business actually grew this past year despite the pandemic. I’ve been able to pay down a fair amount of debt and continue to do so since I’m not traveling and going out to eat, etc. I have to say, there is much to be said for a leaner lifestyle with less travel, less shopping, and less eating out. Even bought a sailboat to use for vacations rather than paying to fly and for 5 star hotels. It’s a whole different experience at a slower pace. I don’t think I will ever quite go back to the way I used to spend money. Have to think that there are a lot of people that feel the same way. It may not bode well for the economic recovery but it’s about time Americans saved some money instead of going into endless debt and enjoying life at a slower pace."

After the coronaviruses closed my work, unemployment benefit is paying my bill and groceries.

2021-03-08 02:21:02,"My story is at the other end of the financial spectrum...

Had originally lost my job due to 2 cancers in one year (cancers #2 & 3). Picked up contract work. That vanished with the pandemic. The amount I get in unemployment is well below the poverty line (when no government add on). I got lucky and got into hud otherwise I'd have no money for rent (currently pay $25/mo). I need health insurance (this state didn't expand medicaid) so was lucky with hud otherwise I would have had to choose to live in my car to pay for health insurance.

I have gone through my savings, am having to choose to forgo medications that I need, health care, some car repair (11 year old car)... Fortunately the state has increased the amount of SNAP we get to the max (currently $204/mo) although I am managing to eat on less for when that ends so that I will have a bit of surplus I can use then.

I had a gofundme (search on carolynbi -NYT feel free to delete this portion of my comment if you feel it is inappropriate to put this here) to try to pay down medical debt (actually still have it but it is unrealistic that anyone would donate in the middle of this financial mess) so cancer visits are at risk if that facility chooses to enforce their rules for debt payments (of which I have missed numerous payments).

I am better of than some who lost their jobs. At least I got into subsidized housing. I have SNAP. I just can't pay for bills, meds... But my choices are still between needs, not wants and needs."

Nevertheless, the change in our household was psychological. First we stocked up on toilet tissue like the entire nation, then by Christmas we only shared gifts that could not be purchased online i.e. homemade cookies using curbside pickup, poetry on Zoom with relatives, and book clubs to stay engaged. Lastly, our housekeeper only comes once a month, now. We've learned to ""make do."" However, want to keep her employed.

Of course, a small difference in rate of growth can still mean significant suffering, but nonetheless, I expected more dramatic variation than the results showed. It leads me to wonder whether this was the reason the article didn't go into the specific data."

If we had only believed that COVID would just go away, it would have, because things that you don’t believe in don’t exist. But I see the morgue as half empty, not half full. We need to find a balance between my economy and your life. We did all this social distancing and 500K people still died, proof that social distancing doesn’t work. So I say let’s open the economy and see what happens. What have we got to lose?"

My husband will receive his second jab today and I am scheduled for my first jab in two weeks.  Even though I am considered an essential worker and a vintage age individual, the earliest date I could grab was the end of the month.

That being said, my husband and I will continue to wear masks, keep a healthy distance and probably not eat at any restaurants for quite a while yet.  When we visited some restaurants back in December, we saw workers in the kitchen NOT wearing masks nor gloves.  How am I supposed to feel safe about eating after seeing that lack of safety and precaution?

I completely understand the urgency and desire to ""return to normal"" but until this virus more contained and slowed down and the majority of the country has been vaccinated, I won't and don't feel as if we are completely out of the woods yet.

A year is a long time.  Waiting another few months (3-6) is doable for us, but I also can appreciate why folks are chomping at bit, waiting and needing a return to their routines.  In the end, we all make our own choices and decisions.  At least for the time being, I prefer to be safe than sick."

Are you kidding me?

I swear...it's as if in some perverted way,  a certain segment of society actually enjoys all this communal gloom and doom.  It gives them something in common to talk about (ad nauseum) with family and friends.  It allows them to feel a part of something.

So take this story here, which yet again is suggesting cause and effect, where there may not in fact be any.  Is the indoor dining in and of itself creating a rise in infection rates?  Or could it be that, when it comes to those people who opt to dine at indoor restaurants, that those are also the same types of people who engage in other types of activities, and to a sufficient enough degree that, when added all up, it puts them in more situations where they may be more likely to get the virus?

Also, when you talk about mask mandates being removed, this type of all or nothing language perpetuates a mindset among certain Far Left that masks must be worn at All Times, in All Situations (even while alone, in the middle of the forest?!).  They then use this to shame people...particularly if the person not wearing a mask does not strike them as being 'one of them' (Far Left, a Liberal, etc.).  It's tiring."

In addition, all of them have had to accept less hours and reduced hourly pay (independent of their reduced hours) in order for the restaurant to remain open. 

If one thing could come out of all this, I would like to see full-time independent restaurant workers like my son be able to make a *living wage* in exchange for the constant burns, slips, unloading of trucks, knife cuts, personnel turnovers, 115-degree kitchens, and boss dramas, now along with risking their health during a pandemic.

I am really put off by the whiny, entitled attitude of many restaurant and bar owners.

For example, when they received billions in P.P.P. payments, they complained that there was no way they could meet the forgivence criteria -- because they had no customers and thus no need to pay workers (and the repayment forgivence was granted by spending 75% of the funds on payroll).  But the whole point of the PAYCHECK Protection program was for businesses to keep paying their employees even through closures, etc...   The business owners thought all that money should be given to them to spend on their lavish lifestyles.

Also, these same business owners are the ones who've always argued that they deserved to earn more than their workers because they (the business owners) were ""the ones taking the risk.""

But then when risk became reality, they changed their tune in a hurry.  If they wanted job security they could have continued their education and become a public school teacher, or a postal worker.  

But no...  These ""entrepreneurs"" (sic) want to have their cake and eat it too.

After reading that Covid spread by aerosol droplets out into the air further than six feet and that it stayed there, I double masked and stayed away from crowded indoor space.  I did travel by air but did not remove my masks on the plane at all.  The other cue was the documented spread in certain restaurants.  At that point, I quit worrying about touching things.  Just focused on not breathing in other people's exhalations.  I ended my gym membership (which seemed toxic) and have not been in a restaurant in a year.

If they had wanted to be able to draw a conclusion, they would have compared the growth rate in cases in counties that implemented a mask mandate to similar counties that did not, and compared counties that opened restaurants etc. to those counties that did not open restaurants etc.

It is a beautiful state with ocean communities that attracted day-trippers from other states all summer long. NY license plates all over historic Newport. 

It is a state of high numbers of elderly who fell quickly in the early Covid days.

We have many colleges and many students acted with vulgar impunity.

We live close together here, we are wedded by blood and by affection, and this state suffered greatly. But it was not simple recklessness that drove up the numbers. That did exist. It was love and dear relationships and sweat labor that drew its residents too close together.

Poverty and age and density are no match for a pandemic. We have them all. But I live here and I love my little Rhody. And I thank those service workers who risked all, allowing me to stay at home."
2021-03-05 21:37:49,"The vaccine rollout in RI was just a continuation of the same. The state probably lost three weeks rolling out the vaccines. It could have adopted processes and software of neighboring and more successful states. Unfortunately, RI state public health leadership (a term used advisedly) felt they had the answers and their ""plan"". No thanks, CDC, we have our plan. This incompetence undoubtedly brought about very defensive responses and unfortunately, lost lives. The vaccine rollout could have been an example of how to do it right - given the state's compactness and potential agility. Instead, it went in the opposite direction."
2021-03-05 22:00:52,"""Few"" here in RI ""blame Gina Raimondo""? Many thousands of us beg to differ.

She was always more capitalist than compassionate, and though she started well at the beginning of the pandemic - she could never stop favoring business over citizens. 

We never had a proper lock down that lasted long enough, never fully closed down restaurants well enough - and Raimondo *never* did anything to ameliorate the underlying conditions of poverty and hunger that helps fuel all epidemics. 

Worse - she all but abandoned her duties once she was nominated by Biden - ensuring that the vaccination roll-out was a disaster, which certainly cost and curtailed lives.

Many of us are now glad she's gone - and hope she never returns."
2021-03-05 22:04:45,"Having spent significant amounts of time with my family in Rhode Island over the past year, I find none of this surprising. Bars are and have been packed. Even when bars were closed, drinking in large groups was ubiquitous. Masks are worn inside stores but rarely anywhere else. Throughout the summer and fall, “pods” of dozens of unmasked people gathered in non-socially-distanced clusters, in the parks, on the beaches, and in front of restaurants and bars. Parties in private homes were neither limited in size nor restricted to immediate family. This was 100% predictable and fueled by preventable human conduct. Governor Raimondo has been less than effective."
2021-03-05 22:38:40,"RI born and bred (only left very recently) 

Rhode Island was kind of a perfect storm in regards to Covid. It saw cases early (some of the first cases in the country came to RI via Italy after a school trip), and it became a geographic loser once things began to get bad in New York and Massachusetts. A lot of people live in RI and commute to MA, so there was travel back and forth before the borders closed, and a lot of people from NY and other places have second homes along the RI coast. Couple with that the large population of college students who, even in the best of circumstances, have to cross state lines, and a large population of black and hispanic people in high-density, high-poverty areas, and you've got a problem. Rhode Island is also Catholic and more politically conservative than would perhaps be expected, and, since everybody knows everybody, the concept of ""pods"" or ""bubbles"" didn't go over well. Gina specifically mentioned in her weekly addresses that she kept her recommended ""pod"" size on the large side (8 people, I think?) in order to accommodate large families. A huge population of RI workers are employed in healthcare, education, and other essential fields, which further risks transmission. Everything gets magnified when you're dealing with a million people within a thousand square miles."
2021-03-05 22:41:22,"I don't know a lot about Rhode Island, except from driving through it to get to MA or NH.  But they knew this was coming, and it happened anyway.  No governor or government in such a situation should get a pass.  They failed.  Period."
2021-03-05 22:44:12,I suspect keeping schools open played a role in transmission.
2021-03-05 23:54:05,I was in Newport in July. I was stunned by the number of people not wearing masks in the dense summer crowds. My friend and I left early because we felt so unsafe. Anyone who was in Rhode Island could see this was going to happen.
2021-03-05 23:54:52,"Walking around Pawtucket and Central Falls (both cities with beautiful old mill buildings along the Blackstone River, many converted to condos and apartments), it's clear that mask-wearing compliance is very high (even if the poster in the Post Office of DeJoy states that mask wearing is only ""recommended""). The vast majority of residents are acting responsibly and doing the best they can."
2021-03-05 22:01:56,"You can blame Governor Raimondo, you can blame NYers (like myself) who traveled to their homes in RI but there is no escaping this: The fall chill sent people indoors, where risk from the virus is highest, and the holidays brought people together. 

People just did not, would not stay home. People just did not, would not give up their holidays. 

We have been told to avoid all unnecessary travel. I have friends in Florida right now who are there visiting family for no reason whatsoever. The selfsame friends saw the family in June; in September; for Thanksgiving, and for Christmas. I assume this is happening x1,000 across the country. 

So unless Americans wake up to the fact that this is a highly contagious virus that transmits for the most part indoors, these horrid Covid numbers are what we're going to get."
2021-03-05 21:30:32,"president trump declared a Covid National Emergency on 
March 13th 2020.
Early May ; Rhode Island become the first New England state to reopen amid coronavirus pandemic...

This felt too soon then and in retrospect it proved to be too soon...
 I remember Gov. Gina Raimondo speaking about a balance between peoples health and the states economy,
she should of erred on the side caution,
she should of erred on the side of peoples health..."
2021-03-05 22:30:15,You focus on the poor but step into the suburbs too and you will have seen affluent people getting bored of staying home very early on and many did not adhere to the governors suggestion of no gatherings. East Greenwhich high street on the wkends looks like there is no such thing as a pandemic.  I did listen and I still do but as a result am referred to as uptight and paranoid because of it.
2021-03-05 20:10:00,"Also, she kept the schools open, which has drawbacks in these pandemic times."
2021-03-05 23:53:50,"The argument makes little sense. Washington DC has higher population density and yet far lower infection or death per 100,000."
2021-03-05 21:55:24,If I recall there were plenty of TV ads in June 2020 in NYC stating RI was open for tourists. Unwise decision!
2021-03-05 23:57:31,"I’m a loyal Democrat. I can’t imagine voting for a Republican. But I place the blame squarely on Democratic Governor Gina Raimondo for Rhode Island’s failure with COVID. Her unwillingness to take strong measures at the outset endangered people and set up a culture of lax mask wearing and social distancing. And things got worse once Washington DC came calling.  When her focus turned to her chance to join the Biden administration, her leadership of Rhode Island came to a screeching halt. She was nowhere to be found. I wanted her to be a genuine success for the people of Rhode Island, but as it turned out she was only concerned about her own success."
2021-03-06 00:10:31,"Let me join the chorus of Rhode Islanders commenting to thank Joe Biden for getting Governor Raimondo out of the state.  The failure of imagination of our leaders in responding to this crisis in  a small state with  a  supposedly top flight school of public health and medical school is jaw dropping. I never received any communication from  the Department of Health concerning Covid until January 2021! Our Governor was a master of PR (and fundraising) and not much else, Our longstanding tradition of  mismanagement  endures."
2021-03-06 00:13:29,"I live in RI. I find it interesting that this article highlights the poor communities in Central Falls and Pawtucket but compliance overall with restrictions has been pretty poor here among the rich as well. My husband’s family is affluent and they’re lifelong Rhode Islanders. While they’ve been very cautious (especially since we lost family members to the virus), the people in their extended social circles have not been - large holidays, constantly flying back and forth to their second homes in Florida, treating their country club as a place where COVID doesn’t exist, and so on. And guess who provides food for the holidays, works at the airport and cleans the country club? People who live in Central Falls and Pawtucket.

Also I don’t think anyone who doesn’t live here (I did not grow up here) can truly understand the Rhode Island mindset. Very tight knit communities and since they never leave the state they somehow think national news doesn’t affect them in any way. Their worlds are truly very small, and that even includes the well educated and successful people."
2021-03-06 01:04:33,While the dense population certainly contributed to the spread of the virus this density could have been taken advantage of with vaccination sites easily accessed.  Unfortunately both the supply and the lack of government leadership or any visible plan was absent. In the absence of any explanation of the continued mess here one can only conclude incompetence.  Millions of dollars was spend on field hospitals which fortunately were not needed but where was the expenditures on vaccination. Go figure.
2021-03-06 01:14:43,"The problem's not just dense population of a small space. Washington DC has a lower per capita rate than the state of RI, and it's a city! I'm sorry-Gina Raimondo doesn't get a pass on this.  In her rush to get schools opened, Raimondo went on TV weekly, telling Rhode Islanders how well we were doing, while imploring people to avoid social gatherings. Yet she refused to make any tough decisions in order to avoid the spread of Covid. She reopened restaurants and bars to indoor dining way too early, and put little teeth into enforcing rules. She opened gyms. Then, when rates started sky-rocketing, she waited way too long to reimpose closings, and when she did, ti was too little, too late. She did nothing to keep essential workers safe (grocery workers still aren't eligible for vaccines if they're under 65) and admonished them when they were afraid to go to work. (I was terrified my young students would lose their only parent.)  She kept prisons filled with people and  allowed evictions to take place, leaving people homeless.And finally, once Biden was elected and her chances for a cabinet position appeared on the horizon, Raimondo all but disappeared. The losses and misery experienced by so many people need not have happened. Gina wagged her finger and blamed people for their personal behavior, while taking no responsibility for her poor leadership. I hope she does better as Commerce Secretary-we're glad she's gone."
2021-03-06 01:55:57,"Thank you for this very informative article.

One reason for the initial high virus caseload in the Northeast was that the virus arrived early due to the major metropolitan areas linked to international travel and then it spread undetected for many weeks. When we knew there was a problem it was too late to avoid the first wave. This was especially true of NY/NJ and MA. The people fleeing NY etc brought it to RI. 

Lot of complaints about “public health guidelines” in the comments. If you want to see how public health measures when followed properly can make a huge difference, just contrast the outcomes of Norway and Sweden, adjacent Scandinavian countries with highly similar demographics, levels of wealth, healthcare, etc. Norway followed the science (400 deaths/5M) and Sweden did not (12,000 deaths/10M)."
2021-03-05 22:40:54,"“Doctors and nurses were trying to cope with rising caseloads, often without the protective equipment they needed, with constantly shifting guidelines and with their own resilience stretched to the limit.”

Federal leadership takes the blame for some of this. 

But Rhode Island is about as blue as it gets.

2021-03-05 20:43:28,It's not lost on me the man hired to direct seniors to the vaccination family in the lead photo is improperly wearing his mask.
2021-03-06 00:56:27,"Isn't this the same person (Gina Raimondo) and state the NY Times lauded recently for keeping its schools open? See article linked below this article dated 2/2/2021. 

The changes between articles for those of us who keep track is enough to give one whiplash. One moment readers are told ""it's all clear to open schools"" and in the next breath that RI is the 3rd highest COVID rate per capita of 50 states in the US with the CDC precaution that high community rates may preclude schools from re-opening. 
We can't seem to save ourselves with our lack of discipline and willingness to acknowledge the dangerous situation we as a country are in."
2021-03-06 02:05:46,"Two fact checks: Maine is poorer than Rhode Island by every relevant measure; the population density of NYC is 27,000 per square mile, surpassing that of Central Falls by a wide margin."
2021-03-06 02:05:51,"I live in Rhode Island and agree with the factors discussed here.  But it is not noted that nearly 40 percent of the votes went to Trump.  Some pople working in local government are anti-maskers and posted about anti-mask rallies on Facebook.  Neighbors held parties in the fall with sleepovers and had holiday parties. Poor people got sick because they couldn't isolate, people in my town chose to party because Trump encouraged them."
2021-03-06 03:17:18,"Most RI deaths occurred in nursing homes.  I lost a relative there myself.  If mismanagement occurred anywhere it was there.

Also, RI has a much higher percentage of nursing home residents per capita than surrounding states.  Much has been said about NY nursing home failures during COVID, but the reality is that many states had major problems there."
2021-03-06 03:28:16,"""Patients were sent up (from the ER to hospital rooms) with pending test results, potentially exposing other patients as well as the nurses who cared for them.""

That sounds about right, but it doesn't square with the CDC guideline, referenced in this article, that people infected with covid are contagious for only ten days. 

The CDC also says that hospitalization is typically necessary in the second week of infection, by which time 10 days (or very nearly 10 days) will have passed, meaning most hospitalized patients would not be contagious. That's hard to swallow.

One reason it matters is that when authorities put a number like ""10 days"" on a guideline, some people take such things literally and will keep count until day 11 thinking that's the day they stop being contagious. I know that institutions such as colleges have established covid isolation guidelines based on the advice that covid sufferers are contagious for only 10 days after the infection is known either by testing or the emergence of symptoms. How's that working? It sounds pretty risky."
2021-03-06 03:33:15,"I’m a native Rhode Islander living in NYC. I’m very disappointed with the vaccine roll out there. My parents are 79 and won’t be vaccinated until this Sunday. My father lives in section 8 elderly housing in a building with 170 other apartments in Pawtucket. My mother is the manager of that building. No officials contacted her about coming to the building to vaccinate the residents until a couple weeks ago. 

They had an entire year to plan how to best distribute this vaccine. I understand vaccinating medical professionals first, but how is a building filled with hundreds of elderly people an afterthought three months later?"
2021-03-06 02:33:20,"I am an employer in Central Falls. Maria Rivera is our newly elected Mayor and has made it her mission to vaccinate everyone. This past month she offered Moderna vaccine to all CF residents and people who work there. It’s an on going program

I encouraged my employees, even doing the rather daunting task for them booking appointments. About half of us are now vaccinated. That being said most of my co-workers from Central America and Cape Verde have resisted, despite our best efforts. Two factors, It’s just not in their culture and they simply don’t trust the Government. 

The Mayor has offered to help, but their resistance is very much real. 

RI is home to many other ethic groups, such as the Italians and Portuguese. Like the Cape Verdeans they are all very family oriented. Large extended families that gather weekly. Children grow up and buy the house down the street. Aunts, Uncles, cousins. At over 1,100 people per square mile it is very densely populated. They don’t go anywhere either. A trip to “Massachusetts” becomes an event, even though Boston is 30-40 minutes away, it might as well be 200 miles.

That is Rhode Island."
2021-03-06 12:19:20,"We're still waiting for vaccine here in South County: Narragansett, South Kingstown, Charlestown and Westerly.  The Governor opened us up for summer tax dollars.  We endured a full summer of out-of-staters.  Week in and week out out-of-state plates came to our vacation paradise.    Residents changed their markets to try and stay safe.   Walmart in Westerly and North Kingstown were full of vacationers. No one was quarantining upon their entry.  Beaches were packed.  We also have a large population of college students from University of Rhode Island renting in our community.  University of Rhode Island limited the number of student able to live on campus to help with transmission.  Where did these students live?  In our Towns, every rental property was full.  We here in South County deserve our vaccines, but I don't see any help coming.  Shame on Rhode Island. PS the URI students were very responsible."
2021-03-06 13:26:45,"Rhode Islander here. We were fortunate to be able to leave the state in October and have no plans to return until summer, when my husband and I have received vaccines. Rhode Island is a wonderful state, with warm, friendly people. That endearing attribute is part of the problem. Many people could not stop themselves from gathering with friends and family. The pain of not being with loved ones was worse than fear of Covid.  I miss my loved ones in the Ocean State, but not enough to risk my life."
2021-03-06 04:41:57,"Gina Raimondo failed RI then gets appointed a position in Washington. 

The media in the state bowed down to her and RI CDC director while never doing any real reporting of how false the numbers were.   

Instead she and the local media continued to spread a PR campaign of how much better we were than other states while people died and the virus spread. The NYT has reported the numbers all along yet the TV and print media in RI whitewash the numbers.  In RI 33 of 100,000 people have COVID. 
Compared to states like FL 28 per 100,000 RI isn’t doing well.


Gina was quick to blame teachers for failing students by not providing an in class experience only because she wanted the low income parents to get back while the rest of the white collar workers worked from home, yet she didn’t prioritize teachers to receive vaccines after calling them essential front line workers nor did she prioritize blue collar workers in markets, restaurants, delivery services, hotels, etc.  

The RI Schools teachers and school administration had pivoted to provide a virtual then hybrid learning experience and continue to teach throughout this pandemic.   

Teachers didn’t abandon the state or leave it in limbo without any direction from leadership like Gina.  She never gave them any credit.  

I see why she was appointed in DC as another never be a leader in tough times and blame others when things go wrong"
2021-03-06 13:44:18,Many RI residents would not wear masks - don't just blame the tourists.
2021-03-06 07:57:13,Talk about failing upwards. Good or Gov. Raimondo and I guess future president Cuomo. In most most countries they'd be in jail.
2021-03-08 15:37:58,"This talk of new, dangerous variants is a bit of fear mongering. Yes, these new variants are something to consider.  But at the same time these new variants should be expected as the norm, not as something abnormal. We know viruses mutate very quickly, so new, more virulent variants will arise... AND less virulent variants will arise. It’s similar to watching waves roll in on the beach; there are a lot of them, each one slightly different; some come high up onto the sand, others not do much"
2021-03-08 17:08:31,"Meanwhile, here in Northeastern Vermont, we're having a huge outbreak because our governor didn't think it was important to vaccinate prisoners.

Unfortunately, we do not have any grocery stores that even have curbside deliver, so we must be exposed to who knows what if we want to buy food.

Add that to the idiots who refuse to wear masks and even run businesses that post that they refuse to wear masks.  (They lost their franchise license and I really hope they lose the entire business for this.)  Even my neighbors routinely have six cars in their driveway for parties, and the other ones see no problem with going to and from Florida.

I am terrified and haven't left my house for almost two months.  I'd starve if it wasn't for Amazon and Dominos.  And since I'm not yet 65 and am healthy, I'll probably be waiting for a vaccine until the end of the summer.

Sometimes I feel like the only person who even cares about Covid anymore."

2021-03-08 17:27:22,"I am glad this being reported with appropriate context for the variant’s appearance.  I don’t find it fear-mongering at all.  It’s straight reporting along with reasoning to remain vigilant in staying masked and following guidelines to reduce community spread.

The situation is a bit like racing to beat a speeding train. Virus spread is the train, the better we are at masking and physical distancing the slower the train.
Vaccination rates are cars’ speeds at getting across the tracks.  The faster the vaccination rate, the sooner we get across the metaphorical track.  The extent of the surge is basically how well we get the population across the track in time."
2021-03-08 18:14:10,In some ways it is all in the statistics.  The more people infected means more opportunity for the virus to mutate - which is what viruses do!  Some mutations are lethal to the virus and some are lethal to us.  Some lead to more transmission and coupled with the lethal changes form the horror our clinicians fear.
2021-03-08 19:04:39,"And then their are red state governors who are perfectly willing to incubate as many of these mutations as possible so we can all suffer the consequences.

It feels like we are not going to be able to live without this pandemic nipping at our heels for a very, very long time."
2021-03-08 14:24:41,"You need a score card to keep track of all the virus variants and which vaccines are effective against them,  It would be more useful to embed a matrix at the top of all these articles instead of the pictures (which I have seen repeatedly), so that information is easily decipherable. Other than that one complaint, the Times has been extremely thorough covering this. On the wish list front, I would particularly be interested in seeing something on the status of promising therapeutics and the best case scenario (time wise) of them being approved."
2021-03-08 20:24:00,"I think this type of information should be better communicated through the media, particularly cable TV and local news. It may not help but if people could better understand the consequences of not wearing a mask they may be more likely to put one on. The more the virus is allowed to spread the greater the chances of more severe illnesses and death, much of it a result of not wearing masks or social distancing and refusal to get a vaccine."
2021-03-08 20:52:31,A really successful virus mutation is one that becomes dominant by being highly transmissible (like measles) but does not usually kill but leaves its vectors somewhat mobile in order to spread (like the common cold).  One can hope that this Coronavirus evolves in this way.

We are not out of the woods but state leaders are too arrogant and ignorant to deal with real science so many more will suffer and die and our COVID mess will continue.

On the other hand, New Zealand, who believed in science, is getting back to normal.   Who knew science worked?"
2021-03-09 00:31:29,"This is why international travel should be limited (not stopped, but certainly limited), domestic travel should be limited (not stopped, but certainly limited), and mask mandates MUST be kept in place.

It is a fact that VARIANTS require REPLICATION and the virus cannot REPLICATE unless it finds a new host.  Which means that slowing SPREAD and REPLICATION right now will stall the growth and spread of new variants.

Please, please, keep things calm until at least 50% of the country is vaccinated.  We will pay for this folly later."

The Governor and some of his associates don't seem to understand their fellow citizens, we're compassionate and we can accept the truth, so just tell us. Rather a sad ending to the New York story.

New York's voters would be wise to deny him another term as governor."
2021-03-05 09:33:33,"This story alone appears to be grounds for non re-election, investigation, and possible impeachment, apart from Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo’s relationship with women. (I hope that this does not reflect on his father, past Gov. Mario Cuomo.) The article and background “research” on the selection/resignation (grateful for those of character) of Gov. Andrew Cuomo's team reveals a “leadership style” similar to that of past Pres. Donald Trump, serving the ""leader"" and not ""the people."" Once again, the (re)writing of the narrative (“cover-up”) seems to be key."
2021-03-05 09:51:32,Under Trump suppressing figures was a must!
2021-03-05 10:16:33,"If a doctor falsifies a medical record to in order to hide a malpractice, it's deemed to be a punishable crime. What of a politician who's ordered the manipulation of medical data to hide his own horrible decision making which resulted in the loss of the lives of many of New York's elderly nursing home residents?"
2021-03-05 10:22:06,"This just the tip of the iceberg. When the pandemic subsides, a lot of local and state officials will be scrutinized over numbers. Numbers were horribly inconsistent across the board."
2021-03-05 10:45:25,"I can’t believe anyone would want anything less than criminal charges and serious jail time. This was an issue that demanded honest transparency because lives were on the line. Other governors and government officials around the world had to make decisions based on what was happening elsewhere. At best, he put lives at risk for political expediency. In all likelihood people are dead because of this coverup."
2021-03-05 10:50:47,I may be dense but is the issue how the data was broken out and not an overall undercount?The article is not clear on this. It seems to be that if a nursing home patient that died from COVID had been transferred to the nursing home after being released from a hospital that treated the patient for COVID that the death was allocated to the hospital? To my mind it appears the hospitals appear to have been doing triage unbeknownst to the rest of us.
2021-03-05 10:54:55,"I am so very sorry to the see the governor go out in a blaze of glory. Isn’t the governor a lawyer? What his team did is circumvent the true. Now comes the blame game. It is time for him to go. 

S.R"
2021-03-05 10:56:37,What the Governor did is shocking and harmed many. That there are those on this blog that continue to support him because of his political party is unacceptable.
2021-03-05 11:05:39,"From the data I have seen, New York has the second worst deaths per capita from COVID in the country.  New York is also near the bottom in terms of the percentage of the population vaccinated.

It seems pretty clear that the Cuomo administration did not do a very good job addressing the pandemic and yet for a substantial period of time Andrew Cuomo was lauded as a model for others to follow.

Deaths per capita in Florida, which has a larger population, is significantly lower than in New York.  Nevertheless, Florida has been repeatedly criticized for its handling of the pandemic.

Why have these two states been repeatedly mischaracterized when the facts tell a very different story?"
2021-03-05 11:07:26,"Before the pandemic, Cuomo and the NY State legislative branch led by Andrea Stewart Cousins faced a huge, multi billion budget deficit driven by Medicaid costs. Many Nursing Home residents receive Medicaid to help cover the $15,000 per resident per month list fees. Is anyone asking: subconsciously or consciously, was Cuomo’s 3/25 order to send Covid patients  to nursing homes driven to help them resolve that budget issues while keeping beds open for people that are “more productive”?

At a minimum, this cover up is much more than just covering up numbers. It is about how we treat our elderly. 

We need to respect our elderly and take care of them. But the anti-corporate progressives that run the state can’t figure out how to fund their ideas by bringing business and investment in the state to cover the costs (e.g., the loss of the Amazon HQ tax revenue and job was all Andrea Stewart Cousins and the legislature, not Cuomo). The Democratic run government can’t get it together. They talk a big game about caring for people but are totally incompetent when it comes to figuring out ways to fund them. So, sadly, did we essentially “eliminate” part budget problem by subconsciously or consciously eliminating a group of people?"
2021-03-05 11:22:24,"""Where there's smoke there's fire"", very true in this instance.  People were wowed by his comforting presence on TV.  It turns out he was gaming his office for power, celebrity, personal vanity and now to try to proposition girls who worked for the State.  A very clear pattern of abuse of power and given his history of bullying not something that the powers of law enforcement and accountability should overlook in any way; the need to hold him accountable and prosecute violations of the law under which we all live."
2021-03-05 11:25:09,"""At the time when the report was being prepared, Mr. Cuomo, a third-term Democrat, still enjoyed broad popularity for his televised news briefings.""

Turns out Gov. Cuomo's appeal was the result of his performance and messaging.  He was, in effect, hosting a daily cable show, using cherrypicked statistics.  Enjoying his fame and promoting his book.  Safe to say, he understood his audience well."
2021-03-05 11:30:14,"It’s hard to see in the comments that people are still blaming Trump here. That former guy is a lot of things but he was not the cause of this self-made mess. Or was he? If political gamesmanship played a role here, we need to know that."
2021-03-05 11:37:56,"By saying that he ""rewrote"" the report, what we really mean is that Cuomo lied. 

Later in the article, he is described as having ""publicly apologized for his actions"" following numerous claims of workplace sexual harrassment. What Cuomo actually did was apologize for how his remarks appear to have been interpreted, which is something completely different. 

More generally, Cuomo is the embodiment of toxic masculinity, as evidenced by his bullying behavior (remember Andy Byford?), anger management issues (the stories are legion in Albany), sexual aggresion towards women (e.g. sexist jokes such as the sausage innuendo with a female reporter), sexual dominance (consider The Nation's 2016 article or NY Mag's 2018 piece), ""tough"" demeanor, aversion to feelings, denial of accountability, etc.  

Regrettably, a culture that normalizes toxic masculinity (and a city that defines itself in such terms) is now being made aware of the consequences, which include emotional violence towards women and loss of life among seniors."
2021-03-05 11:42:18,"I've read all the Times' coverage on this and still don't see how Cuomo is responsible for thousands of deaths, any more than any other decision-maker in the world during the pandemic was: nobody knew what to do, until they did. Meanwhile millions died.
I do not believe Andrew Cuomo would let a single person die if he could prevent it. I don't think it's in his character, unlike some other governors I can think of. 

I  believe that if people as canny as Cuomo and DeRosa hid numbers - knowing there was every chance in the world it would eventually come out - it wasn't so Cuomo could sell more books. The political situation/funding/public opinion has been charged throughout this nightmare, thanks primarily to division-stoking identity politics by the GOP. It's possible there isn't one clear answer to why the lie happened. We'll see.

Most politicians make money on the side; book-writing, public speaking, insider trading, family business bolstering. As with all the accusations against Cuomo, his transgressions in this department seem light, at least comparatively speaking. I know that's usually not good enough for the Dems. Not sure how good a strategy of idealism is against one of nihilism."
2021-03-05 11:47:44,"Did anyone see the governors last press conference two weeks ago today? He and Dr. Zucker doubled down on everything.   Cuomo blame the press, Republicans, politics and of course former President Trump for all his woes. They actually said, both of them, that they would do the same thing all over again knowing what they knew 11 months ago on nursing homes. There was an almost empty Javits Center. There was an empty hospital ship. These are places that covid positive patients could’ve been sent until they were negative before being sent to spread the virus throughout nursing homes. That mentality by the governor is outrageous and incompetent. Florida sent covid Positive patients to hotels from hospitals. Cuomo sent them back to nursing homes."
2021-03-05 11:49:10,"Cuomo has committed the classic political blunder where the coverup is worse than the original crime. He should have been truthful from the beginning, but his fragile ego made optics more important than acknowledging the facts on the ground."
2021-03-05 12:01:30,"There is no evidence that transferring COVID positive patients after a hospital stay led to more COVID transmission in long term care facilities.  In fact, since COVID transmits most easily before a patient shows symptoms, after a hospital stay, those patients would be much less infective, if at all.  COVID was already rampant in the longer term care facilities as the first people got visibly sick.  Staff brought it in."
2021-03-05 12:05:56,"The Governor offered a self serving mea culpa when he explained away the missing number of nursing home deaths as a ""void"" created not to deceive but because his administration were working so valiantly to mitigate the Covid crisis.
   But the opposite was true as is so often the case, his political aides and appointees' efforts interfered and eventually overrode the efforts of NY's health department.

  All his postulating against the a corrupt federal administration the past year doesn't account for much when one is engaged in their own cover-up to further their own political ambitions.
 
   That is the problem we face as voters, 
if we do not hold all these liars accountable for their words and deeds we cannot hope for a just society."
2021-03-05 12:15:53,"A few weeks after Jim Malatras, with no health care experience, re-writes the Health Department report to exclude nursing home deaths, he becomes the chancellor of the State University of New York system?  That seems like a significant ethical breach for a chancellor of higher education in NY. A political favor?"
2021-03-05 12:18:22,"Unfortunately hubris seems a dominate characteristic of politicians which grows more pronounced the longer they are in office.  This is one reason term limits make sense.  When our republic was young most politicians treated their positions as part time and temporary jobs having other careers for their primary livelihood.  Now, people get out of school, go to work for politicians as support staff, and then transition into elected politics when they believe the time is right."
2021-03-05 12:22:02,"When this is over (she said, hopefully) there is going to be a lot of blame to spread around. Lying about how deaths were counted was a terrible idea, but my guess is that in the great post mortem about how this was handled across the country, this is going to pale in comparison to what went on in the border towns or on the reservations, to name two examples. That doesn’t make it ok, of course, but it is to say that from sea to shining sea in this great nation, people suffered and died at the hands and egos of our elected officials. As it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be etc etc. 
This whole thing is yet another lesson that we refuse to learn: stop assigning savior-status to elected officials. They are human, neither more nor less. We venerate people to the point that they believe their own mythology, then we get mad at them for doing so. And then we want them to resign when we find out that they were human all along."
2021-03-05 11:58:35,"Come on people, follow the money.  The nursing home industry is a huge and powerful business in New York state.  How much money did that industry channel to Cuomo?  Was this undercount an effort by the Cuomo administration to shield the owners from examination by medical investigators?  Responsibility for the deaths rests solely with the nursing home owners and managers, not with Cuomo.  The real question remains, however, as to why he did it and if there was pressure on him by those in the nursing home industry.  The Times really needs to dig much deeper into this story, because I suspect the new accusations of impropriety are somehow also related. Connect all the dots - see the picture."
2021-03-05 10:09:56,"The overall number of deaths is unchanged. Governor Cuomo was fighting against a new disease, about which little was known. Hospitals were overwhelmed. It was, essentially, a wartime environment. Trump called it a hoax, and there was no Federal leadership. Dr. Fauci was muzzled. Cuomo's daily briefings helped get us through it.
Let's have some perspective, please."
2021-03-05 11:22:03,"The administration has also swept under the rug what happened in the state's prisons, where the number of cases reported by the NYS Department of Corrections and Community Supervision increased from under 800 in October of 2020 to nearly 6,000 this month, a nearly eight-fold increase in five months. Thirty-four deaths have been reported by DOCCS. Did more occur after people were transferred to hospitals--or released?"
2021-03-05 12:01:04,"Stop belaboring this.  Resign, Cuomo.

This country needs to move on.  Period.  And we cannot afford any hindrances.  Be a gentleman.  Out."
2021-03-05 11:43:52,"Lying is a key skill for politicians.   Right?

So, Cuomo has only demonstrated skill in a key skill set.  

Right?

Lastly, fudging all these numbers to look good did not stop him from trying his best (maybe too good now that NY City is completely dead).   

I say, if Trump spent an entire life lying with every sentence and every breath and became a new religious figure for America?

Give Cuomo a pass.   He did a good job in a tough situation."
2021-03-05 10:43:50,It seems to me when a public figure reaches the height of popularity there is concerted effort by the media to take that person down a few notches. Reminds me of the dirt that was dug up about Eli Manning.
2021-03-05 10:50:20,The total number of deaths was not under reported and the hospitals required discharge of patients no longer eligible to stay.  The media seems to be consistent in their assault on Cuomo.  You have to wonder if they have an agenda of their own.
2021-03-05 10:52:34,"To coin a phrase, 'Power Corrupts ( and The Corrupt Crave Power)'."
2021-03-05 12:25:27,"Andrew Cuomo should have been truthful. After all, where else could those people have gone. The problem is not that they were put back in nursing homes, the problem is the quality of care provided. Workers that do most of the care in nursing homes are overwhelmed during normal operations. They are poorly trained and underpaid. Meanwhile, the owners and operators of nursing homes are quietly amassing fortunes off the backs of inhumane conditions for residents and slave wages for workers. 

The coverup may run much deeper than just covid. We should all be asking why a disease, any disease, should spread so easily in a facility that is supposed to be housing vulnerable people? A facility that has as its most basic function the care of the sick and elderly should be able to contain contagious diseases. In fact, they should be the experts at doing so. 

There is much more than Andrew Cuomo's ego driven misrepresentation. Andrew Cuomo needs to be dealt out of the equation by voters. But the problems in nursing homes need to be investigated starting with what happened during the pandemic."
2021-03-05 12:30:48,I still struggle to understand this controversy.  Was it under reporting overall or just numbers attributed to nursing homes?  One thing I do understand is Cumo's leadership role during the worst of the pandemic.  It was effective and welcome.  Perhaps lives were saved because of his kind of leadership.  We know that lives were lost and are being lost because of the GQP.
2021-03-05 12:31:09,"I would expect lies and a cover-up from Trump officials, but naively I have held Democrats to a higher standard.  Interestingly,  Cuomo's similarity to Trump is scary with regards to his willingness to ""brush aside public health expertise.""  Are there no honest men and women in politics?"
2021-03-05 12:35:38,"By ordering nursing homes to accept residents recovering from COVID-19 after they were discharged from hospitals, Cuomo facilitated the spread of the virus within a closed environment, leading to the elevated death tolls among the residents.  Another example of where the state supposedly knows better.  Now, caught out, they are scrambling to cover-up their ineptitude.  On the bright side, at Cuomo looked good on CNN while ordering these people to their fate."
2021-03-05 12:37:03,"I remember Cuomo getting hounded about this nursing home re-admittance question all throughout April last year. So I've been hearing about this for a year now. I am still genuinely confused after tons of news cycles and coverage, whether or not the decision was in fact the ""wrong"" one. Despite all the reporting and all the time spent on this I still haven't see the Times or anyone else really go in depth to show how this policy was different from other' state's policies and how it might have been right or wrong. My understanding was that there was a fear that there wouldn't be enough hospital beds, and that these were supposed to be recovering covid patients; but again I'm confused because all the reporting since last April has been about the controversy and not the facts of the actual situation."
2021-03-05 12:46:03,"This continuing argument is about the bookkeeping of where people passed away. 

If they passed away in the hospital, then that is where the death is supposed to be recorded on the death certificate. If they passed at home then that is where the death is recorded on the death certificate. 

If they passed away in the hospital, and came from their residence, would you expect that their death would be recorded as being in their residence?

The location of the deaths are not reported where the person was, the deaths are recorded where they are. Otherwise the death certificates are being falsified. 

What is not being understood here? What do I not understand? Please explain it so that even I can understand this. Thank you."
2021-03-05 12:47:01,"As far as I can tell, Cuomo had the same political motivations as Trump. Just goes to show you there's bad apples on both sides of the aisle."
2021-03-05 12:14:44,"People soon forget the true terror of the plague last Spring. Here is a leader that acted and reassured while acting as a national alternative to Trump absurdity. If deBlasio or Gillibrand or AOL were in charge it would have been horrific. Yes, it is easy to pile-on now, but frankly, we got thru it. Yes, no thanks to the intern who, luckily, came to an insider position despite her hate-filled baggage."
2021-03-05 12:15:43,"Gov. Cuomo refused to participate in 17 White House briefings for governors because he claimed they were political propaganda.  He refused to meet with the HHS Secretary, who offered to meet with him to discuss his concerns.  In September, he said he was creating his own review board to retest any federally approved vaccine.

For these actions, he became a hero of the media and democrats."
2021-03-05 12:16:09,Cheating with numbers is a fault because people are misleaded about the danger of nursing home for Covid patients.
2021-03-05 12:10:25,"Cuomo was just doing what every other governor has done, and, in Florida and Texas, is continuing to do unimpeded."
2021-03-05 11:07:58,Where was the media?  It was obvious that forcing nursing homes to accept Covid positive patients would cause massive spread amongst the most vulnerable - The media was so supportive of Cuomo that they didn't even look for the cover up - It is sad to see the media play favorites in politics
2021-03-05 12:39:03,"This is potentially fraud, conspiracy,  and obstruction of justice, besides being amoral and      cold hearted. If you combine these nursing home events with the credible complaints from young women about Cuomo,  he truly needs to step down.  This is what happens when self importance and arrogance spirals out of control.  New York would be well served by obtaining new leadership soon.  Citizens have become weary of the pretend leadership that conveys a pretense in the media, which is often contradicted by the real back stories."
2021-03-05 11:40:05,"The Times has not been clear. We are owed better reporting. Where did each and every patient die that was misallocated? Data, please. How are those statistics counted by law, and by medical practice? If a patient was in a hospital, and recovered from COVID, and then died, is that death a COVID death, or a death from some other cause? How many were hospice care? Where do patients transferred from nursing homes to hospitals go after discharge from hospital? What does Medicare mandate? Nursing homes are unsafe under ordinary circumstances, but if a patient has multiple serious comorbidities and dies having a mild case of COVID, how is that death counted? If New York State had higher nursing home deaths from COVID than other causes, what would that mean for the state? Would it have obligated a closure of these nursing homes?  Would the Trump Administration have changed the formula for federal assistance based on this data? For all the hubris, the Times has yet to actually explain why statistics were altered, what benefit this change might have had.  Was it the way of counting that was flawed? Did patients die from COVID or statistics? That is what the Times implies. We need better analysis, and frankly, better facts."
2021-03-05 10:59:11,"I could readily understand Greg Abbott (TX); Rick DeSantis (FL) or Kristi Noem (SD) covering up executive malfeasance in their states. They never cared about anything except “individual freedoms” anyway, parrots for Donald Trump. We saw this on a national (federal) level under the last president. And, during the first frightening surges of the pandemic, Andrew Cuomo was a calming hand, a governor seemingly concerned about the well-being of the citizens of his state. Must-tune-in-daily television. Turns out, it was all a lie.

There is no Santa Claus, after all."

2021-03-05 11:58:57,"I get they played with the numbers. And they got caught.  With the number of people who knew what was happening, did they think no one would ever reveal the truth about the numbers?  That no one would ever find out?  At some point they had to have seen there was bleeding and taken measures to stem the flow, yet they did not. they doubled down on nothing to see here.  And then....well then the bleeding got much worse.  Surprise, surprise.  My question is was this simply about the optics for Cuomo as being a hero?  Or were there others who stood to benefit?  Perhaps hospitals which wanted the nursing home patients out to free up beds and to be able to tell non nursing home patients the hospitals were safe places?  Or nursing homes which would have to admit they couldn't keep residents safe from Covid?  And the CEO's of those places didn't want to be seen as uncaring and cruel.  Sort of smacks of Catholic churches that hid abusive priests rather than admit what was really going on.  Worked for a while, but then...."

2021-03-05 12:13:02,"Why are so many Dems including the so-called progressive Times going after Cuomo? Now that Trump is gone time to eat our own? The timing is so suspicious. We have bigger fish to fry and much worse offenders to spend time fussing over if that’s how us progressives want to spend our time. Cuomo has overall done an amazing job as Governor leading us through the pandemic, and I won’t forget that. We could have been stuck with someone like Abbott or Desantis. Or Zephyr Teachout. I wasn’t the biggest fan of Cuomo but he doesn’t deserve this attack from all sides. He admitted to his mistakes (a rare thing, let’s face it) and apologized. I’m disappointed in the harassment situation because he should have known better, but it’s not impeachable. Leave him alone for heaven’s sake and let us decide in the next election. The most corrupt part of all of this is how the Times and so many so called Democrats have the knives out for this man."
2021-03-05 11:15:48,"If Cuomo is responsible for this, it really isn't front page news unless it includes an explanation of the terrible harm it created.

Those who suffered trauma from the deaths of their loved ones were not kept from the information of those deaths and reducing the reported numbers did not increase their trauma. 

Lying about statistics is certainly a black mark against Cuomo but journalism is failing if they make this somehow the equivalent of Trump's utter incompetence and negligent homicide that was the encouraging of Americans not to wear masks. 

Why do we make all sins equal in politics and call it fair journalism?"
2021-03-05 12:29:42,"We've had four years of examining the narcissistic behavior of the former guy. That same behavior explains every bad action Cuomo has taken or been accused of. The parallels are staggering as is the refusal of his most ardent supporters to examine the evidence. They, like former guy supporters, fall victim to confirmation bias and “whataboutism”. Cuomo may be our autocratic narcissist, but he's still an autocratic narcissist."
2021-03-05 12:43:34,"This is not the first time the Cuomo administration has skewed the facts to get the result Cuomo wanted. This is not the first time state officials have been coerced against their better judgement to give the Governor political cover on something he wanted.

If The NY Times is interested in digging further, they should examine actions of the Department of Environmental Conservation, the Adirondack Park Agency, and the Cuomo administration regarding the snowmobile lobby. 

Look at the lawsuit against state plans for the Remsen-Lake Placid rail corridor. The original plan was thoroughly rejected by the court - but Cuomo still prevailed. How?

Look at the upcoming trial over tree-cutting for snowmobile trails and the Forever Wild clause in the state constitution. 

There’s a pattern of the Governor’s office giving primacy to political concerns in which Cuomo and his aides decide on the answer they want on a given issue - and the policy is cut and sewed to fit.

Cuomo’s ‘leadership’ style is that of a bully once you get past the spin. Sometimes it works for the public; sometimes it doesn’t - but it’s always what Cuomo wants.

Rule 1: Cuomo is always right.
Rule 2: When Cuomo is wrong, see Rule -1.

What we are seeing now is what happens when Cuomo loses control of the narrative, and inconvenient facts come to light.

And yes, this what hubris looks like, with a side dish of karma."
2021-03-05 11:52:49,"This is what happens when you let the media set the narrative. They fawned over this guy because he wasn't Trump.  They didn't take a critical look at him then because he wasn't Trump. Bottom line is we won't like it, but there is very little difference between Republicans and Democrats, Trump and Cuomo at this point can't tell who is worse."
2021-03-05 10:48:24,"It's worth remembering that saying this was considered ""misinformation"" in the Spring."
2021-03-05 11:42:47,"A useful reminder that there is corruption, incompetence and grandstanding on both sides of the aisle. Lawyers, who almost by definition succeed by plausibly pleading bad cases, unfortunately but perhaps inevitably dominate politics.  Time for more scientists in politics."

Through bad decisions resulting in affecting our most venerable to the virus, many deaths could have been prevented We should not be distracted by Mr. Cuomo`s sexual harassment issues in pursuing a much more criminal issue."
2021-03-05 11:02:27,"The nerve of this politician to have COVID-19  press conferences while he was suppressing the true data is mind-boggling.
I didn't think any politician could surpass Trump in blind hubris, but I was wrong."
2021-03-05 10:05:47,What I do not understand is why was the Governor not using the Javits Center or the Navy ship for these patients? The ship stood virtually empty from every thing I have read. Was it politically motivated so he didn’t have to give  the President any credit for sending it? I also remember listening to the back and forth between the Governor snd Albany reporters...he was horrible to them if they brought up the nursing home situation...so condescending and bullying. What a disappointment. Those deaths did not have to happen.
2021-03-05 11:16:40,"As the saying goes, power corrupts and absolute powers does so absolutely. During the early days of the pandemic Cuomo was as close to absolute power as any Governor and he used that power for good, and in this case cynical and arguably illegal purposes. This new revelation puts the lie to the previous excuses his administration has given for this tragic abuse. His only clear choice now is obvious to everyone but him I suspect."
2021-03-05 10:23:37,"I never cease to stop being shocked by politicians' priorities. A pandemic that has killed thousands (millions if you move beyond the US) and is still a threat yet the priority seems to be on 'how they look'.  Strengthened by writing a book, geesh.

Being a native of New York and liking how Cuomo held daily broadcasts when the pandemic started which calmed NYers, I would like to think this accusation is false.

But he's a politician, first and foremost.  Sad really."
2021-03-05 12:49:42,"This scandal goes deeper than this. Deaths are under reproted. My Mom went from an Assisted Living Facility to a Hospital where she tested positive for Covid. She remained in the Hospital for 2 weeks and was then sent to a Nursing Home for rehabilitation from Covid. The game plan was that she would remain in the Nursing Home for 4 weeks, supposedly recuperating. She did not make it through 2 weeks. She passed away on Thanksgiving Day. No mention of Covid listed on the Death Certificate. Looks like folks are not being listed as Covid Death Statistics at all. My mother was up on her feet, walking and breathing, prior to contracting Covid."
2021-03-05 12:52:11,"As others have pointed out, this is a deplorable mish-mash of issues.
If Cuomo's decision was taken in the early stages of the pandemic, while NY was hardest hit, then, it conforms to what happened all over the world- it was guesswork triage in a pandemic nobody understood. We did not even understand how easily it was transmitted.
Second, Donald Trump was waging a propaganda war with the State of New York over Covid response, not offering to assist the state. Trump treated NY like an enemy foreign state. Trump was the aggressor, and in response, Cuomo was limiting the damage of an enemy. Time somebody put this in stark relief. One year later, wiser, and no longer hostages to DJ Trump, we've got a bit of leeway to explore this discussion.
Mixing Cuomo's sexualize conversation in the office into this report is unconscionable. When set against the mountain of problems the state was/is facing, it's a flyspeck, and should be dealt with at the ballot box."
2021-03-05 12:21:58,"So. Cuomo, like Trump,  doesn't trust doctors. 
And. Cuomo, like Trump, makes up statistics. 
And Cuomo,  like Trump,  bullies and intimidates people.
And Cuomo, likeTrump, blames others for his wrong-headed actions.

I think I'm getting it now."
2021-03-05 12:28:16,"It is quite clear that Cuomo and his closest, most senior aides lied to cover up the extent of Covid-related sickness and death his ill-advised nursing home policy caused among elderly New Yorkers. The cover up demonstrates Cuomo lied in televised press briefings when he represented that New York State had fared better than other states in protecting nursing home residents from the coronavirus. And thus Cuomo’s recently published book about the supposed successes of his Covid policies and how they were driven only by facts and science is rife with more lies to coverup his mishandling of a public health crisis. All of these many shameful and inexcusable lies, taken together with Cuomo’s sordid record of shameful and atrocious sexual harassment of women and his incredible and reprehensible pleas of merely being their misunderstood mentor, warrant his immediate impeachment or resignation from office. Enough is enough."

2021-03-05 12:53:57,"New Yorkers have lost confidence in the Governor in the midst of a pandemic killing New Yorkers. Altering data because it ""cannot be verified"" is unacceptable and an absurd excuse. The Governor is doing the right thing by hiring a criminal attorney. He needs one. Simultaneously he is accused by two women of inappropriate touching and sexual harassment by one other. ""Flirting"" because he is single is not acceptable by a man in power with a subordinate. I thought this was a settled matter. The handwriting is on the wall. It needs only the Governor to read it."
2021-03-05 12:04:29,"The number of nursing home residents who died from the virus wasn't changed. . .it was where their deaths were documented as occurring (nursing home vs. hospital).

2021-03-05 10:52:50,"Both Cuomo in NY and DeSantis in FL are two we know who have manipulated, have hidden, data.  The NYT needs to write about each.  Each is very wrong.  The NYT should also find out which other state governors have hidden and/or manipulated data.  It is unlikely to have been just two.

In FL's case the data person was fired when she refused to go along with DeSantis.  She took the data at that time, and tried to keep an honest update outside of government.  So she was arrested, last we heard."
2021-03-05 11:36:55,"Blue state governors are no better than red state governors. Cuomo wasn’t the only one lying about the data, Newsom also did unethical math on ICU capacity (and maybe other things?) - although I haven’t seen mainstream left coverage on that topic yet. 

If the left wants to continue claiming the moral high ground, we’ll have to accept the science on things like school reopening, and we’ll have to hold our governors to a high standard and punish Cuomo for his lies that likely caused death. And while we’re at it, maybe we can admit that Florida faired better than almost all blue states and learn a few lessons from that response, or is that going too far for NYT readers?"
2021-03-05 12:38:19,"Coumo has lost all credibility, he has got to go! I wouldn't trust anything that this man says. He does not belong in this office! It's amazing what New Yorkers will accept, they need to raise their standards."

This matter would have never arisen, had the plain truth been promulgated instead a sanitized version. Once you're on the slippery slope, falling is easy."
2021-03-05 11:18:24,"I would like to know how many donors from the nursing home industry have contributed to to Cuomo's campaigns over the years.  Otherwise, his need to re-allocate the death numbers makes no sense.  That would also make this a bigger scandal.
This  cloudy article on this subject by the NYT is another one of many.  There is a lack of clarity in every piece I've read."

Cuomo has now added bad governance to being just like some of the other creepy men (Spitzer, Schneiderman, Lopez) elected to 'serve' here in the Empire State.

Whether by resignation or removal via impeachment, Cuomo has got to go!"
2021-03-05 12:14:14,"Of all the cocky peacocks this one used his office to calm and educate in the middle of a terrible storm. Like the person or not, I didn't hear the mob calmly working the crowd at the time. Too much of one bird? Easy to say now.

I remember reporters trying to pin him on the nursing home problem while the bodies were being stacked in reefers with forklifts. In the end are they forced to take the public relations hit if their question didn't address the problem 100% correctly? The entity they work for? Solve problems or just take the governor down?

 The president of The United States fanned out his tail."

That was before 2 more women stepped forward, and one very publicly.  His brand and image is too damaged now.   New York needs a moderate Democrat, like Cuomo, to run the state.  A progressive will do more harm then good.  A Bloomberg clone wouldn’t be terrible."
2021-03-05 13:07:11,"Of course he went to great lengths to cover up the real facts. He wanted to rise further in politics and the real numbers threatened to damage his carefully created ""hero"" image.

Truth——New York was hit HARD early in the pandemic.
Truth—the nation took comfort in Cuomo’s daily press briefings early in the pandemic—-in contrast to the president’s lies.
Truth—-New York had to make a hard decision as hospitals filled with Covid patients.
Truth—-nursing homes were chosen as a transitional space, to free up hospital beds.

And then.

Truth—-the Governor sought to withhold the truth from the public about nursing home deaths, instructing aides to do so.
Truth—-healthcare administration leadership resigned in response to the Governor’s handling.
Truth—-Governor Cuomo has bullied those who seek to share the truth, such as state representatives.
Truth—-3 women have come forward stating Governor Cuomo sexually harassed or assaulted them.

2021-03-05 13:01:53,"The sexual harassment allegations will go away; this won't. Why on earth would he do this? We are in the midst of a pandemic, the country knows that thousands will die. If the nursing home deaths, those that contracted the virus and died while in a nursing home was 9000, so be it. America would understand those numbers because we knew that Covid hit the elderly the hardest. 

But by doing what he and his administration are accused of doing, he and they, made an obvious and deliberate decision to obfuscate and massage the numbers so the actual number of deaths on his watch would look better; hence, making him look better.

If proved true, and it certainly looks as if it is, this is a death blow to both his tenure as Governor and certainly his political career."
2021-03-05 12:58:10,"Why is anybody surprised?  Yes, my politics are similar to Cuomo’s but the man has always been laser focused on himself.  He has always put his ambition before his constituents.

Thank you NYT and the ""liberal biased"" press  with covering this - and not flinching to do so."
2021-03-05 13:03:24,Cuomo withheld death counts so that a book portraying him a hero could sell.  The reasons reflect a man of outsized ego who cannot be wrong at all costs.  He should resign.
2021-03-05 12:01:42,"This article, itself, appears to have gone through a meat-grinder of an editing process, making it unusually difficult, for a NYTimes piece, to discern the who, what, when and where of the headline's trumpeted why. For example, in the last three paragraphs, we learn that health officials were worried that ""Mr. Malatras, wanted to simplify too much"" but that ""Even so, an edited version prepared by Mr. Malatras did not remove the higher death toll. That occurred later...."" So what, then, were public health officials worried about if it was not the nursing home numbers? We never find out. It leaves the impression that there may well be a lot of other missing pieces in this reportage of a long sequence of events with a lot of variously motivated players at every level  and more moving part than meets the eye."

Total distraction from the actual nuttiness and grift going on in our country."
2021-03-05 12:34:33,"Frankly, NYT coverage of Cuomo seems like it's gotten personally at this point and it's clouding editorial judgment. the top story today is not that Cuomo made some blunders during a one-in-a- century natural disaster with no leadership from the federal government is not surprising. Today's top story is not Cuomo's missteps,  but the fact that the Republicans are filibustering Biden's covid stimulus bill."
2021-03-05 12:23:55,"This entire discussion is nonsense, and the NYT should be ashamed of themselves for pursuing it. The question they want us to believe is important enough for the front page is, if someone was in a nursing home, then moved to a hospital, then died, should they be counted as a nursing home death? Wait, what you say? That is the most pressing question journalists should be investigating in March 2021? Nothing is more important? The same people who were saying in March that the pandemic wouldn't kill anyone, that we should ignore it, were saying in May that Cuomo had killed a bunch of people in nursing homes. Is your politics detector blinking yet? There is nothing obvious about how you count where someone died. Anyone who has sifted through mounds of data can tell you that. If John D. was in a nursing home in November 2019 and died in a hospital in March 2020 does that count? Should anyone be trying to figure that out in say June 2020 when the central question for NYS government is how do we reopen schools safely? Seriously?   I have yet to hear one serious account of the decision taken in April 2020 to move Covid positive patients from hospitals to nursing homes.  This ain't that nohow. There were some other things going on at the time that were not Fashion Week, you may recall, like setting up a field hospital in Central Park. Was the state following CDC guidance? Did moving the patients cause outbreaks? Answer those questions first. Then play politics with your readers. Deal?"

2021-03-05 11:30:16,"Why are people persecuting Governor Cuomo when The Trump regime was on a vendetta to get him because he didn't praise Trump for Trump's great handling of the pandemic? People should be praising New York's governor for having kept the Subways and Consolidated Edison running, and for having kept the Trump-abetted virus from killing and hospitalizing even more New Yorkers. Governor Cuomo kept Ne York's hospital system from going into care rationing mode. Would you have liked your wife or husband or mother or father or child or yourself  to get Covid and die not due to having a fatal case but because you couldn't get a hospital bed and treatment?

As for these self-righteous young ladies: They are adults. If Governor Cuomo said anything to them that they felt offended their virtue, they could have slapped him in the face and left the room. He didn't rape any of them. He didn't hold any of them hostage. He didn't do anything to any of them that might have urged them to go to a hospital emergency room. And if, contrary to what he has confessed in his self-criticism (like a defendant in a Communist show trial or Galileo before The Inquisition), he did discriminate against any of them, then let them take him to court. Each of them had two functional legs, didn't she? 

Governor Cuomo is being scapegoated. He should proudly wear his  scarlet ""A"". Shame on the pruditans for humiliating a good person."

2021-03-05 12:23:21,"Coverage of Cuomo's actions related to nursing homes during the pandemic has been more egregious than the usual bad faith treatment of our press, including in the New York Times and this article. There are many points of failure, most indicating bias, others just ignorance or stupidity. In this article, a prime example of factual duplicity, endlessly repeated here and elsewhere, is the distinction between deaths in the nursing home and deaths ""connected"" to the nursing home. The latter chiefly refers to patients transferred from the nursing home who later die in the hospital. Who should report their death? Cuomo's statistics refer to deaths from Covid IN the nursing home. This article fails to maintain that distinction. Why is it important? First, how many other states report Covid nursing home deaths that include those patients that have been transferred and died in a hospital? I suspect NONE of them have. Certainly the deaths should not be reported by both. Did nursing homes all receive notice from the hospitals that death occurred? Did the hospitals all stop reporting such deaths in their own statistics? How many of those transferred patients died from causes other than Covid in the hospital? Many such questions arise from this issue, all of them ignored by the press coverage and by this article. Second guessing decisions in such a mess is difficult; attacking a political leader based on this mess is plain irresponsible journalism."
2021-03-05 12:38:01,"There is some rather important context missing here. In August of 2020, the U.S. Department of Justice sent a letter to four states requesting data on their nursing home deaths, including residents of state-owned long-term care facilities who had been transferred to hospitals with Covid-19 and had later died. The letter is here:

<a href=""https://www.justice.gov/opa/press-release/file/1308986/download"" target=""_blank"">https://www.justice.gov/opa/press-release/file/1308986/download</a>

Those states were New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Michigan. At that time, New York was the state with the tenth-highest Covid-19 death rate per resident. New Jersey was 2nd, Pennsylvania 6th, and Michigan 11th. The state with the highest rate, Massachusetts, was not included.

[Source: nanha.org]

Now why would the feds only be interested in facilities “owned, operated, or managed by, or provide services on behalf of [New York] or [a] political subdivision of [New York]” (“Public Nursing Homes”)""? Note that it SPECIFICALLY includes ""a POLITICAL subdivision"". 

That's quite curious, don't you think? If the federal government were so concerned with the welfare of nursing home residents in these states, wouldn't one expect them to ask for statistics concerning ALL nursing homes, not just state-run facilities?

So what was the difference between these states?

New York governor: Democrat.
New Jersey governor: Democrat.
Pennsylvania governor: Democrat.
Michigan governor: Democrat.

Massachusetts governor: Republican.

Now do you wonder why Gov. Cuomo was concerned about the numbers?"

By moving elderly ill patients from hospitals to nursing homes to free-up hospital space for incoming COVID patients he wound up killing these elderly folks and others in the nursing homes where the virus was running rampant.

It just did not seem to occur to this self-proclaimed genius to move people into the almost empty USS Comfort, the Javits Center, or the temporary hospital that was set up in Central Park opposite Mt. Sinai Hospital. Nah, he was busy writing a book lauding his performance and appearing on TV."

Cuomo's inventory of stupidity is quite long: tanking the economy, including real estate and banking when he headed HUD; disappearing the Buffalo Billion into the pockets of his cohorts and then shutting down the Moreland Commission when their investigation got to close to him for comfort; failing to have a system in place in New York to distribute the vaccinations when we all knew that they were coming; killing elderly hospital patients by moving them into nursing homes to free up hospital space for COVID patients instead of using the USS Comfort, the Javits Center, or the temporary hospital which was set up in Central Park opposite Mt. Sinai Hospital and then lying about it; now we have his inability to keep his hands to himself around attractive women; not to mention how, when his daddy ran for the mayoral nomination against Ed Koch, a campaign which he managed, he came up with the hateful slogan ""Vote for Cuomo, not the homo"".

2021-03-05 13:23:55,"It’s hard looking from the outside to assess the real truth, but it is perfectly plausible that President Trump’s capricious behavior precipitated the decision to undercount. Not trying to excuse Gov. Cuomo, but perhaps the Trump administration also gets some of the blame here. It also seems to me that COVID deaths in general are more a function of the chaos generated by the Trump administration than by any action by a specific governor."
2021-03-05 13:38:56,"1) Returning Covid infected patients to nursing homes. That was a decision made a year ago, in a desperate situation, overturned in May 2020.   Was there a better alternative, then?  Was Javits or the medical ship available? Did this decision seem to have advantages then (such as keeping elderly people in what was, for most, their home environment), but turn out to be bad?  Did it actually increase nursing home deaths? Hospitals were sending many people home from ERs, who later died.  He made a tough decision when no one else was willing, and I think Cuomo deserves leeway on this.  It should be studied to figure out what exactly happened.

2) Flagrantly hiding the number of deaths of nursing home residents.   This is obviously what was done by his aides who were interfering with the NYS DOH responsibility.  It is disturbing, to say the least, when any  government official interferes to change data on public reports.  For a governor to insist on misreporting statistics, then lying about it is shameful. 

 Mr. Malatras, chancellor of SUNY, might perhaps consider stepping down from HIS position due to his willingness to put politics over truth. Linda Lacewell, is an attorney versed in ethics and risk management, closely tied to Cuomo, so had to be aware of the ethical line this was crossing

This makes me so glad, BTW, that the Governor never got to replace the NYS Comptroller (DiNapoli)  with a hand picked board of  political appointees!"
2021-03-05 13:42:33,"When you are dealing with a pandemic, you have to know where people contract the disease, not where they die.  Cuomo not only required nursing home residents to take hospitalized patients back, but he refused to allow testing prior to their return putting the most vulnerable population at exponentially increased risk."
2021-03-05 13:43:28,"From politics to business, far too many “leaders” define themselves by metrics and as a result everything has to be manipulated to be good. As a result we have so many corporate dashboards where everything is magically green, improving and at target! This is a whole other level in unethical self promoting and dishonesty. Shame on the governor and shame on us for equating comforting press conferences with competence in all areas. Transparency is the key to any culture of health and safety."
2021-03-05 13:45:05,It seems illogical and contradictory that it would be ok to return covid infected people to nursing homes when you are closing schools and locking down cities.
2021-03-05 13:45:13,"As if Cuomo took his cue from Trump. Terrible optics, worse practice. Were it Mario Cuomo instead of son Andrew the father would have taken a page out of FDR’s book of how to be a NYS Governor in a crisis. As a newly elected governor in Albany in 1929, FDR faced the stock market crash and a Republican who denied the utter reality, Hoover, in White House. Not only did FDR guide his state, he found a way to be nominated and elected US President in 1932. The rest is history as is Andrew Cuomo."
2021-03-05 13:51:37,"Here in Upstate, NY, Cuomo has never been popular. He's more of a downstate thing. I have to wonder if the bloom is off that rose (finally) or if there will be a level of ""OK, not great, but he's doing a good job."""
2021-03-05 13:59:16,"People would have forgiven Cuomo for making a mistake under difficult circumstances if he had simply owned up and tried to fix things, instead of digging in.  But that is how the Governor rolls..."
2021-03-05 13:59:24,"With all this attention being paid to nursing homes due to the tragic consequences of the spread of the coronavirus among their residents, it is frustrating that no one seems to be talking about the fundamental underlying issue. Very simply, nursing homes, as they currently exist within the framework of applicable law and regulation are an archaic, failed model of care. Nearly sixty years after its authorization, the Medicaid program continues to prop up this failed model, which wouldn’t exist if their residents had any choice about it. Had New York successfully implemented what has long been the expressed policy goal of enrolling nursing home eligible individuals in comprehensive, specialty care management programs that integrate the covered benefits of both Medicaid and Medicare, far fewer individuals would be residing in nursing homes and those that were would be receiving far better care."
2021-03-05 14:01:02,"Please put this nursing home story in some real context i.e. look into the accuracy of statistics reported by all the other or at least some of the other governors in the country. 

My father was in a nursing home for some years and my guess is that Cuomo made the mistaken judgement to have nursing homes take people back because he knows as a matter of course nursing homes abandon patients in hospitals once they get them out the door.

They did it to my father--refused to take him back and he died. They still got his Medicaid money though.
 
People didn't understand the way the virus spread at the time so it was a terrible move. But I'm guessing part of the the intent was to try to make nursing homes be responsible for the people they are paid astounding amounts of money to care for and whom they fail at every level."
2021-03-05 13:18:18,"Andrew Cuomo's manipulation of Department of Health Covid data reminds me of Donald Trump's observation that ""If we stop testing right now, we'd have very few cases.""

Of the two, Cuomo looks worse on this one. At least Trump couldn't move infected people around."
2021-03-05 13:26:23,"Uh oh!  Bad news when the cheerleaders stop cheering for their team.  The problems with the senior homes were properly reported on by the independent press last year.  The sheep may have been taken in by the propaganda from CNN, but it did not fool those who knew the nursing home situation.  Cuomo clearly erred and his errors led to many deaths.  He knows it was wrong because he actively tried to cover up the facts.  In this case, dead men do tell tales.  
I'm not sure why the Times has taken so long to address the problem, but better late than never."
2021-03-05 13:29:50,"Sad to see Cuomo's current troubles.  But if his blood thirsty critics running through the streets with torches think this will help to install a repub governor at some point, that won't happen in the great state of NY."
2021-03-05 13:45:58,His Emmy should go back and every copy of his book thrown into the bonfire of mendacity.
2021-03-05 13:23:43,Now that's more serious than flirting with employees or wanting to kiss a girl at a wedding. That's worth a resignation.
2021-03-05 13:38:30,"You people are amazing.  He hid the stats?  The state of New York was on national television showing charts and graphs of all their infected, hospitalized, dead and discharged people, along with daily pep talks, explanations, plans for improvement, PLUS the governor taking DAILY QUESTIONS FROM THE PRESS.

My state was still looking around and blinking in shock.  My governor didn't have a clue.

Now you are letting this guy's political enemies take him down.  I guess competence is not enough for you."
2021-03-05 13:16:52,For this alone . . . Cuomo should be punished severely.
2021-03-05 13:39:17,"Until this ploy by team Cuomo appeared I was encouraged that America had some sane and sound leadership. This subterfuge seems more like a trump political stunt, than a Cuomo one.

I will have to rethink my position on sane and sound leadership, I guess."
2021-03-05 13:24:08,"As purely evil as the decision to force nursing homes to accept coronavirus-positive patients who might still be infectious, leading to high death tolls among the elderly residents, a decision shared by other Democratic Governors, Governor Cuomo outdid them all by working very hard, with the help of his staff, to hide the magnitude of the death toll from others.

Governor Cuomo should be charged with the murder of these nursing home residents and the coverup of the reports of the deaths."
2021-03-05 13:34:05,"After Trump, any politician lying about facts feels dangerous. Even a democrat."
2021-03-05 13:22:54,"So, to be clear, people who were living in nursing homes contracted covid in the nursing homes, became sick, were moved to hospitals, and died in the hospital.

These deaths were counted as ""hospital"" deaths and not as ""nursing home"" deaths; But they were counted nonetheless.  No deaths were hidden.

Meanwhile, nursing homes in all states were ravaged, as Federal Law required them to take in covid positive patients. 
 What were they supposed to do with those poor sick elderly people, put them out in the streets?  Haul them off to ""camps"" ???

And in many states, like Florida, the total death count was, and is still, deliberately under-reported as matter of state policy.

To be sure, it certainly seems like Cuomo wanted to spin the numbers to make himself look better, but he was not under-reporting deaths, nor were the deaths attributable to any of the policies over which he had control."
2021-03-05 13:30:08,It would have been nice if the article had told how Cuomo manipulated the numbers -- by counting nursing home resident deaths as hospital deaths if they were transferred from the homes to the hospital before they died -- somewhere earlier than the middle of the article.
2021-03-05 13:41:26,"This is Trumpian behavior. I never thought highly of Governor Cuomo except for his fact- and science-based daily briefings at the beginning of the pandemic, but even for me this is horribly disappointing behavior. I loathe The Former Guy but falsifying data to look better plays into his generally false allegations. Devastating."
2021-03-05 13:43:28,The nursing home lobby is powerful in NY.  Did they play a part in pressuring Cuomo to fudge the numbers?
2021-03-05 13:27:38,The owners of the nursing homes are major contributors to Cuomo's political campaigns and directly benefited by the senior citizens being put back in nursing homes and undercounting deaths at nursing homes. Follow the money.
2021-03-05 13:15:56,"This reporting doesn't pass a basic sniff test.  Cuomo is going to anchor his account of fighting the pandemic on a lie that any rational actor would know is going to be made public sooner or later?  Really?  The dots don't connect well enough to make that assertion.  As for the sex scandal, we now have two Supreme Court Associate Justices who have been accused of far worse and confirmed anyway."
2021-03-05 13:26:12,"""There are no secrets, just truths yet to be discovered"".  Its baffling that a 21st century politician doesn't get this"
2021-03-05 13:37:17,"The point here is Cuomo has created an environment where his aids feel they can do this.  He frequently speaks about following the scientific advice. Yet he empowers his aids to do this.  

On this basis alone it should disqualify him from holding office."
2021-03-05 13:23:28,The same behavior he exhibited as the Moreland Commission was getting too close for comfort - he disbanded it.
2021-03-05 13:48:45,"Here, another instance of the harm that ego run amok can do. Ego that seems to increase in all types of leaders, be they political, corporate, or even spiritual. The ones that can keep that ego in check are the true leaders."
2021-03-05 14:05:15,"It will also be helpful, when looking at the number of New York State deaths in nursing homes to report on the total number of residents in nursing homes in all states. If it turns out that New York had a higher percentage of nursing home deaths compared with all other states, but it also turns out New York also has a higher number of nursing home residents, then will be a fairly important perspective consideration."
2021-03-05 13:17:45,"'It's not the crime, it's the cover-up'"
2021-03-05 13:37:22,Cuomo should be impeached if he doesn’t resign.
2021-03-05 13:54:45,"This is soo typical.  The real perpetrator (the man responsible for AND not caring about half a million+ dead Americans) comes away unscathed and the media and left leaning politicians take down Cuomo instead.
The man seems to have made a number of mistakes and shown bad judgement but what's happening right now is another misguided campaign like so many before.  We can't take down the real bad guy(s) so let's find one that is either push off his pedestal."
2021-03-05 13:55:25,"In January 2021, the NYS Attorney General called out Cuomo’s office for grossly understating the actual number of Covid-related deaths in NY nursing homes.  Cuomo top aide Melissa DeRosa then said they understated the death count because of the US Justice Department inquiry which did not start until AUGUST 2020. Now that it has been revealed that DeRosa and another senior Cuomo aide, Jim Malatras — neither of them having any relevant scientific knowledge or experience — rewrote portions of the JULY 2020 report to understate the death count, Cuomo’s office claims that they were uncertain whether the covered up death statistics had been properly audited. Cuomo must believe that two lies about covering up the deaths caused by his ill-advised Covid nursing home policy are better than one. Now is the time for him to be impeached or resign."
2021-03-05 14:01:54,Wow the apologists in the comments for Cuomo and the reasoning.  This is somehow Trump's fault?  Well I suppose the silver lining is at least these well reasoned analyses give us a pretty good idea of who to blame after the next big California quake.
2021-03-05 13:54:32,"So, the guy lied; he and his team declared the wrong number of nursing home dead seniors, but he did not kill them, did he?  The same goes for trump, the truth did not look good if he went about disclosing that the pandemic was bad.  Instead, he decided to hide the real facts so as not to panic the vassals.  How kind!  Did he kill millions more than was necessary by not disclosing the truth?"
2021-03-05 14:02:12,"This is interesting:
<a href=""https://covidtracking.com/nursing-homes-long-term-care-facilities"" target=""_blank"">https://covidtracking.com/nursing-homes-long-term-care-facilities</a>

The chart on that page shows NY State is smack in the middle of the percentage of nursing home residents among Covid deaths (including those at hospitals), but that bordering states (except New jersey) did much worse. New Jersey did slightly better than New York as of February 25."
2021-03-05 14:08:52,"This was a difficult issue for the Cuomo administration as they clearly had a target on their back from the Trump administration in the middle of an existential crisis.  Many don't quite understand the panic that was occurring in New York as this horror unfolded.
Healthcare professionals were activated to combat this pandemic as best they could with all the tools in their arsenal, generating vast amounts of data.  Perhaps, the Cuomo administration could combat an administration that was anti-science but they could not stop the introspection of a truly liberal populace.  It's great to live in a state where science can veto any party or person."
2021-03-05 13:58:14,"Governor Cuomo ; you said , your quotes “ I don’t trust the experts “, regarding pandemics...You know what, my quote “ I dont trust you either.” !"
2021-03-05 13:27:49,"For the past few days many people have been asking why democrats seemed so eager to remove Cuomo from office over what they perceived as mere boorish behavior with women.
This latest news of cover-up should show them why.
The democrats have been nudging Cuomo to leave over his treatment of a few women precisely so they won't have to push him out over the way he falsified and hid COVID-19 facts in order to promote himself as a savior with a political future. 
For this, we must blame a nation in the grip of not just a virus, but of neoteny. Those immature, needy people across the country who called Cuomo ""my crisis daddy,"" simply because he appeared on TV created a ""hero"" who refused to allow any light of reality to shine on that persona, which in its original sense means ""a mask."" How symmetrically ironic that in this case a mask will bring Cuomo down, if not from office at least from an undeserved pedestal.
In this day of Identity Politics, that light of COVID reality would, undoubtedly, have reflected badly on all democrats as members of Cuomo's primary group. 
So by focusing on Cuomo's behavior with women, democrats gave Cuomo an out that wouldn't tarnish their own image as saviors. But Cuomo rigidly refused to take it even though it would have saved face for democrats and himself. And that made this new revelation inevitable. Identity Politics is the precarious game democrats now insist on playing and it just bit them in their nether quarters.

2021-03-05 13:29:25,I do not understand  these politicians who put themselves in these predicaments.  What is wrong with them???!!!!!  It happens over and over again and the reasons they give are always ridiculous.  Never ceases to amaze me.
2021-03-05 14:04:33,"Hubris rears its ugly head again and again from the belief that one is above just about anything.  When will they ever learn.  

Must add, do read Jim from Sarasota.  Nursing homes, overall, are deplorable."
2021-03-05 13:50:50,Reading about Trump every day was a gut punch.  And after a few calm weeks The New York Times is relentlessly reporting on Cuomo’s behavior.  Please stop.  Please stop trying to take him down.  I am a woman who supports Governor Cuomo.
2021-03-05 13:30:32,RESIGN. RESIGN. RESIGN.
2021-03-05 13:41:42,The media star posing as the leader of the “party of science.”
2021-03-05 13:33:43,"Gov Cuomo, I have one question.

Why were you not truthful?"
2021-03-05 13:53:54,"Without Trump to attack, now the liberals will eat their own. Justifiably so!"
2021-03-05 14:11:36,"The real scandal is that while Cuomo spends his days defending the indefensible, vaccine appointments are nearly impossible to come by.  Focus on the current problem!  There are no appointments to be had in large parts of NY, while Connecticut and NJ seem to be scheduling plenty. Get back to work Mr. Governor"
2021-03-05 14:17:53,Cuomo needs to be held accountable. No questions asked. He needs to tell the truth and accept the fallout.
2021-03-05 14:27:51,"Cuomo took advantage of people and the media who were looking for a hero.  His daily updates were choreographed, and edited for maximum impact. At some point, Cuomo was using his position to profit by lying to New Yorkers.  Cuomo couldn’t have made a bundle on his book, if he didn’t hide reports.  So much for courage.  Cuomo’s deceit needed conspirators.  Everyone involved in editing reports, hiding records, and delaying FOIA request should be fired. Cuomo needs more than losing his job."
2021-03-05 14:32:45,The crime is worse than the coverup. Cuomo should not only resign but do some hard time.
2021-03-05 14:33:35,"In an article about doctored data the NYT should report the correct numbers in a meaningful way, at least. This article, as many NYT articles about the pandemic over the past year, confuses rates and raw numbers. Should the reader be surprised that New York, a state with more than twice as many people as New Jersey, has more deaths in nursing homes? Why not report the deaths as a fraction or percentage of all nursing home patients in the state? That would be more meaningful and informative."
2021-03-05 14:36:42,"As a healthcare provider myself, I am dismayed by the many healthcare providers who participated in this very deliberate dishonesty.  Have we all so given up on integrity that even physicians are willing to commit fraud for political gain?  It's not as though the doctors involved could not find work elsewhere.  Of course the daily grind of treating actual patients lacks the heady thrill of an official title in a powerful administration, and the chance to parlay that into another gig with even more status and money--not to mention a total escape from the bedside.  Healthcare providers who do not blow the whistle on dishonest health information should lose their licenses and title ""Dr."""
2021-03-05 14:42:07,"""The number — more than 9,000 by that point in June — was not public, and the governor’s most senior aides wanted to keep it that way.""

Of course the first question that comes to my mind is, what else has/is being ""sanitized"" or utterly hidden from the public?

Far be it from me to ever utter a supporting or positive word about Trump, but perhaps that administration's inquiry ""into the state’s handling of the outbreak in nursing homes"" would have been warranted, especially with that incredibly unfathomable number of nursing home deaths.

Actually, I don't think it's such a horrible idea for any nursing home that operates from federal monies to be highly scrutinized by the federal government.  New York was not the only state with alarming number of deaths from these institutions."
2021-03-05 14:42:34,"Imagine the cries of Democrats in the halls of Albany and in Washington had a Republican governor had done what Cuomo has done. Where are the statements of indignation from Senator Gillibrand now? 

She had no problem in blasting my former Senator, AL Franken, and leading the calls for him to resign. Why such silence now?"
2021-03-05 15:01:39,"Cuomo clearly fought fiercely for  his people during the pandemic and his exhaustive efforts no doubt saved  many who live far beyond the New York state borders. He certainly made no efforts to minimize the deaths when I was watching him, quite the opposite. How the death count was tallied after the fact seems a minor detail in the total scheme of things."
2021-03-05 15:04:08,This article is not at all clear about the distinction of nursing home patients dieing in nursing homes or hospitals after being transferred from nursing homes or being transferred back to a nursing from a hospital. How is this different from people dieing at home after being discharged from a hospital or just dieing at home. The article does say the overall death count is approximately accurate but not correctly categorized. Obviously a chart comparing what was released by the governor versus the original health department report would help explain your criticism. What did the governor hide? Unless the governor ordered contagious hospital patients discharged to nursing homes it is not clear what transpired. Statistics in a pandemic are problematic.
2021-03-05 14:52:26,"If there was one ""trumpet"" in the orchestra of condemnations and defenses earlier in the week (then about his miserable ""interpersonal skills""), it was, ""But he was a stand-up guy when Covid was raging.""

GET REAL! The accompanying article makes it ever so easy.

Would you rather have a coach like Belichick, given to press conferences where he dismisses some of the questions as ""stupid"" or one like the Jets' ace this past year... whose only skill was handling the media and NOT taking personal responsibility... until he had to be fired.

The parallels are there - one delivered, the other talked a good game. One was honest (""to a fault""), the other didn't have an honest bone in his body.

That's Andy in 7 words - NOT an honest bone in his body.

Aren't even the people whose best ""comeback"" is - ""Trump was worse"" - sentient enough to realize that's too low a bar.

And while I'm in Andy Rooney mode - there's another thing that bugs me: Hearing it said that ""in the final analysis, what's it matter if you count the deaths as taking place in a hospital or in a nursing home?""

FOLLOW THE MONEY. Pathetic that Andy isn't satisfied with ego gratification from running NY State like Mussolini for 10 years and hitting on anybody available. He wanted a ""book deal"" and fudged the numbers principally to up his take!

How low can you go? Take money from nursing home operators that increasingly looks indistinguishable from bribes. Lie on their behalf. Enrich oneself!

Andy - Have you NO! Shame?"
2021-03-05 14:04:57,Shameful. Cuomo need to resign and let justice take its course.
2021-03-05 14:16:26,He obviously has to go.  The sooner the better.
2021-03-05 14:17:37,Unfortunately with this latest revelation Cuomo has become a millstone on the necks of the Democrats in 2022 and beyond. He’s got to go. Biden is next. Worst of all is the media coverup. All these sins were covered up while every mole on Trump’s face was magnified.
2021-03-05 14:24:13,"Classic move. Trump would be proud. 

Time for Cuomo to go."
2021-03-05 14:50:47,"Meanwhile in Texas, Governor Abbott is stopping the mask mandate and opening everything up to full capacity but there’s no scandal about the thousands that will get sick and die as a result."
2021-03-05 14:29:43,"Worse than hiding numbers, it is very likely the sending back of covid positive patients to nursing homes was motivated by the nursing home association who wanted to keep their census up for monetary reasons. They contribute to Cuomo always for this purpose. In this case this would essentially be dooming people to death for campaign contributions. Also another lie by Cuomo is using attorney Abramowitz for the Nursing Home scandal. Abramowitz has no experience in Nursing Homes, but does have a lot of experience with sex assault. So yet another smoke screen by Cuomo to hide that he has lawyered up for the sex scandal. This is how our State is run? I guess to get the restaurants open the restaurant association should deliver a large contribution to the Cuomo campaign. Nothing can be trusted from Cuomo any longer. He has been made. Apparently he is destroying NYC for his own needs. We are like a ship without a rudder. now. I don not trust any word from Cuomo now. His integrity is in shred now."
2021-03-05 14:35:20,"Cuomo, and his brother, held the country in thrall during the first half of 2020, and he's continuing to do so now.

Frankly, he's an East Coast phenomenon."
2021-03-05 14:08:07,"Alternative facts! !  I thought that was something that Trump invented. Did the Governor of New York also change facts to fit politics?? If so, he doesn't have the appropriate judgment to remain in office one day longer. His inappropriate behavior with young women under his leadership is one more reason to replace him with someone with more reliable moral standards. Bye Bye Governor Cuomo. You over-stayed your 'use-by' date."
2021-03-05 14:10:16,"What doesn’t seem to be clearly stated in these at this point repetitive articles is that all deaths were acutely recorded and that we’re arguing about categories of subtotals. The numbers are there, roll them up as you please. This is spin, not a crime.  Take Cuomo on on policy differences and stop these nonsense process attacks."
2021-03-05 14:32:50,It’s incredible to me how Republican leaders make terrible decisions in plain sight and face no consequences yet Democratic leaders are excoriated and scandalized for bad decisions of smaller consequence.
2021-03-05 14:14:07,"While Republicans bubble-wrap their wrongdoers, Democrats cannibalize theirs, and for lesser crimes.  As a native New Yorker in temporary exile, I am following the Cuomo revelations with horror.  Yet, given the egregious lies and actions of the former President and his allies, I hope Democrats will not ""Al Franken"" the Governor.  Investigate and impose consequences...  to the extent that consequences are similarly imposed on Republican public figures."
2021-03-05 14:51:27,"So the “Trump made me do it” excuse is untrue.  It appears Cuomo is simply a talented politician with no scruples, at work or at play."
2021-03-05 14:49:40,This is a crime under Federal and State law. Filing a false business statement to mislead is illegal. Anyone involved needs to be indicted and go to trial.
2021-03-05 14:40:31,Why did Cuomo release covid patients into nursing homes? Were there no alternatives? What about that navy medical ship that was sent to New York?
2021-03-05 14:06:54,"I'm sorry, but why are we harping on Cuomo when no one seemed to care that Trump was saying the China Virus wasn't really an issue and would go away when the nice weather came?"
2021-03-05 14:07:02,"Scandal is what brought Andrew Cuomo into the New York State governor's mansion. Without Eliot Spitzer's resignation in 2008, Cuomo doesn't get elected the first time in 2010. And maybe now scandal will be what ends Cuomo's political career. 

On a side note, I'd like to point out that within the last 25 years all four of America's most populous states have had hereditary politicians as governors--George W. Bush in Texas, Jeb Bush in Florida, Jerry Brown in California, and Andrew Cuomo in New York. Maybe, just maybe, it's time to stop giving the sons and daughters of politicians the benefit of the doubt."
2021-03-05 14:37:22,Sounds like nursing home special interests helped make the sausage.
2021-03-05 14:11:16,"""The aides who were involved in changing the report included Melissa DeRosa, the governor’s top aide; Linda Lacewell, the head of the state’s Department of Financial Services; and Jim Malatras, a former top adviser to Mr. Cuomo brought back to work on the pandemic.""

The list of officials Cuomo will throw under the bus before he accepts accountability."
2021-03-05 14:16:04,"All this really shows is that political chicanery is not limited to the Republicans, and that the best policy when it comes to bad news is to simply own up to it. How many politicians get laid low by over-zealous ""aides"" who feel they have to wrap their bosses in cotton batting? Cuomo should have been a leader on this and say ""tell the truth"" and be confident about his actions."

Was it naïveté or just sheer stupidity on behalf of everyone who knew about the big lie that the truth wasn't going to leak out at some point in time?  No, it was about careers, paychecks and egos taking precedence over human lives.  Time to clean house."

2021-03-05 14:49:22,"The most crucial reason why I could never trust Trump was because he lied to the American people about the virus on so many levels, across the board.

Gov. Cuomo lied to the residents of New York, especially the many families who had lost loved ones at these facilities.

I can forgive many things, but lying?  That goes directly to the credibility issue.  If a person lies to me one time, especially a HUGE lie like this one, how am I ever to trust anything else that individual ever says again?

Getting caught in a lie is something one rarely, if ever, recovers from, especially in the political arena.

Perhaps Gov. Cuomo can keep the snowy owls company in Central Park while his political career continues to melt faster than the Wicked Witch and her broom in the ""Wizard of Oz."""
2021-03-05 15:02:20,"Can we can stop pretending now that Cuomo followed federal guidelines, or shall we keep pretending that voters are stupid? The language Cuomo pointed to is available online for anyone to read. Cuomo's office focuses on 2 very different small paragraphs. And they attempt to take a few words from each and combine them into a nonexistent 3rd paragraph. So if Cuomo caused even 5,000 unnecessary nursing home deaths, and was making life and death decisions for New Yorkers based on his childish battles with DiBlasio that was okay, but underreporting is the big evil? This article should not be complicit in trying to excuse Como's prior actions."

2021-03-05 15:00:41,This is actually criminal. Juking the stats in a middle of a serious public health crisis? It deserves prosecution.
2021-03-05 15:13:07,"My mouth dropped to the floor upon reading these words.    This perfectly describes Obstruction of Justice:

“Mr. Cuomo finally released the complete data, saying he had withheld it out of concern that the Trump administration might pursue a politically motivated inquiry into the state’s handling of the outbreak in nursing homes”

To withhold information in fear of being investigated?   It’s perfectly legitimate that he feared an investigation if he sent thousands of COVID patients back to nursing homes and he was aware that his state has the highest nursing home death rate.   Perhaps one caused the other and he feared being investigated for it so he chose to cover it up.


Amazing."
2021-03-05 15:15:13,"Cuomo's order barring nursing homes from refusing to admit those being discharged from hospitals also included a stipulation that nursing homes could not inquire/determine whether a given patient had previously tested positive for Covid. As a result, not only were nursing homes forced to accept individuals who may have been actively spreading Covid, the nursing homes were effectively barred from determining whether that *might* have even been the case.

Undoubtedly, some of those admissions seeded larger outbreaks within nursing homes. The suggestion that those outbreaks were somehow inconsequential relative to the overall body count is disgraceful (e.g. ""But, but, but, total number of dead would still be 15,000, regardless of where they were counted!"").

It's as if Cuomo poured fuel onto a building fire, then sought to absolve himself based on whether people died IN the fire or later on in a hospital burn unit."
2021-03-05 15:18:20,"If it weren’t for Cuomo and his press briefings thinking Americans would have been completely in the dark about the virus. I’m not sure what happened with the nursing home numbers in NY, but no matter where these poor souls were they were exposed, vulnerable and likely to die. Cuomo was operating at a time where little was known about Covid and he was attempting to keep the hospital system from collapsing. Once he realized that transferring very old patients from hospitals to nursing homes was potentially spreading the disease, the practice stopped. Those who remained in hospitals were treated and many were treated well. So thank you Governor Cuomo for helping the American people by keeping us informed when our then president was ignoring the pandemic and attempting to wish it away. The real scandal is warehousing our elderly in substandard nursing homes that operate for profit and could care less about any individual person. Of course they were hotbeds of disease, look how the operate. There is your scandal."
2021-03-05 15:21:57,"So McKinsey was simultaneously advising Trump on federal response to pandemic and Cuomo on ""Trump-proof"" NY state pandemic response... Subjugating health care and scientific experts to advisors from consulting company was Cuomo's biggest single and systemic failure during this pandemic. As for Trump and Cuomo being played against each other by McKinsey, that is eerily reminiscent of a time when many government and anti-government forces in Africa were advised by the graduates of the Soviet Frunze Military Academy. With deadly consequences for both sides."
2021-03-05 15:22:15,"I'm embarrassed and ashamed of the people in my political party continuing to deny overwhelming evidence and making excuses.

We do not get to choose which facts are helpful to us and which aren't.

His behavior is not erased by competitors or enemies behaving worse. His behavior is not erased because he had other significant, real achievements. 

You have a right to the opinion that this is not significant enough to demand his resignation. You have a right to the opinion that it is a small issue relative to other problems. You have a right to the opinion that this is simply how politicians operate.

You don't have a right to alter the truth: He did this, and he meant to."
2021-03-05 15:23:37,"I am very sickened and saddened as I read this article. I recall as we saw the enormity of the pandemic explode how many of us followed Governor Cuomo’s briefings. We looked to him as someone who was straight with us and a person to be respected and trusted. But now we hear of what was really going on behind the scenes. Not just the nursing home matter, but his treatment of the women who worked for him. Beyond shameful and disgraceful. Let the investigations begin, the complete truths must come out. It is unfortunately another example of those in positions of power lacking honor and integrity."
2021-03-05 15:24:23,"At the time that Cuomo signed an executive order forcing NY state NH's to take Covid patients, those of us who are geriatricians were appalled. The American Geriatrics Society and the PALTC, another national organization that represents long term care professionals both published statements condemning the move and citing the severe risk to the vulnerable frail elderly who live in nursing homes. Fortunately Rhode Island did not issue this order, and the nursing home in which I worked would refuse to take elders with Covid who had not yet tested negative for Covid prior to hospital discharge.
Though the charges of sexual harassment are of course significant and need to be investigated, there is no doubt that Cuomo's decree for nursing homes to take patients with Covid signed the death certificate for many elders in those institutions. That he chose to hide the fact of the serious outcomes and consequences is totally a criminal act.
Instead of touting his alleged achievements, advocating for the production of ventilators far in excess of the number needed, if he had not forced nursing homes to take this tragic move and had also supported high production of PPE for both hospital and nursing home staff, the number of deaths in both populations which have been much reduced."
2021-03-05 15:28:18,"""...the lengths to which Mr. Cuomo has gone in the middle of a deadly pandemic to control data, brush aside public health expertise and bolster his position as a national leader in the fight against the coronavirus.""

Perhaps this is true. But this is a conclusion this writer cannot actually make. Cuomo may have been seeking only to bolster his position, etc. Or, he may, as he has said, been seeking to sidestep all potentially crippling politically motivativated  molotov cocktails that would slow down the critical work being done to save lives and manage the crisis.

We don't know.

Perhaps the Governor has made his bed and he is deserving of the critics coming out of the woodwork now. Those critics are cowards however, or they would have come forward long before now.

I don't excuse the Governor's actions. Full stop. However, I do weigh his ego and his flaws  - and his failings - against the leadership he exercised over the past year during a pandemic of unimaginable proportions here in New York.

And I find I have...understanding and appreciation of the depth and breadth and magnitude of the courage, tenacity, and sheer metal it took for him navigate that crisis.

Does that excuse him? No. But it is a perspective, it seems, that no one else is considering. Indeed, many lives were lost; sadly, some not reported accurately...how many lives were saved?"
2021-03-05 15:33:58,"I stopped working in a Nursing Home in December of 2019. As a citizen scientist who follows Influenza epidemics (trained by the New York City Department of Health) I knew something was up in China as bloggers were reporting. My colleagues and I were alarmed because we knew that in the best of times Nursing Homes were sieves of contagious diseases. Nursing Home administrators are not usually health care workers. Because of their ignorance they jeopardize Nurses Aides, housekeeping, and other staffers predominantly people of color front facing patient caring individuals. Nursing Homes have a huge lobby. I would ask Mr. Cuomo if he receives money from the Nursing Homes or their lobby. 
I am heart broken because some of my former patients and colleagues have gotten sick and died. While that was happening, I called whoever I could to alert them that the numbers were greater because we all knew the count was wrong. It is standard procedure to send sick patients from nursing homes to hospitals. During a pandemic it should not have been standard procedure to send them back."
2021-03-05 15:39:22,"I appreciated the closures and daily briefings and I still do, but I don’t like the lying. And I don’t like the realization that many other people were active parties to the lying or knew it was happening and didn’t say anything. It was a stupendously awful plan for states to send people who were sick with a contagious virus to nursing homes. If only we could have people of good character and good common sense running the government."

2021-03-05 15:16:14,"This piece is a penny short and a day late. The Times was diligently focused on a 24x7 cycle to denigrate Trump's every move regarding the virus, but gave Cuomo a clean pass all the way.

The old Times, the one that earned it the distinction of becoming the newspaper of record, would have never done so. 

Trump was vilified by the Times when he claimed that a vaccine would be available for distribution in December. Over 25 million doses were administered before Biden was even sworn in. Not one positive article to date about this fact. It was left to Nate Silver to begrudgingly acknowledge Trump's vaccine accomplishment in a tweet.

Lucky for Nate he is no longer a Times employee. Because, if he was, that tweet could have got him fired."
2021-03-05 15:17:57,"I remember comparing the very high rate of death among the elderly in Massachusetts with that of New York. I wondered why there seemed to be little public concern or political will to take decisive action despite the very clear fact that elderly people were the demographic hit hardest by the pandemic. 

At the same time, social media was overflowing with hostile dismissals of older people in the form of “Okay, boomer” and the “Karen” hunting craze. Even now, thousands of eligible elderly people in Massachusetts have been locked out of a vaccine appointment system that overwhelmingly favors tech savvy people with high-speed equipment.

So, my question, New York: Would you have done better if you had “known”? Because I think the writing was on the wall, if not in the official reports. 

I hope both of our states will come to grips with how and why we sought to dehumanize and marginalize a group of people at a time when they were being cruelly decimated by disease. It’s easy to blame our politicians, but ultimately we must look to ourselves."

But if were are outraged at a politician for possibly manipulating data that mitigated public safety, like DeSantis, then Cuomo shouldn’t get a pass.

The difference is the pass empowered DeSantis to be seen as a candidate for President by his supporters."

I don't believe (at this point) that he needs to step down, but he should not be re-elected.  We need a good Democratic candidate to run against him in a primary.  NY may be a solidly blue state, but we can't risk that changing because he's turned off too many supporters.  

Don't forget, Trump's puppy, Elise Stefanik, is scratching on the door to get in."

2021-03-05 15:41:56,"Andrew Cuomo is corrupt, & this isn't surprising to anyone who has lived in New York & paid attention to New York State politics for the last 10 years. A lot of Cuomo stans only know him from Chris Cuomo breaking every rule in journalism to give his brother good press on CNN.

This man had one of his own cronies conduct an ethics investigation into his office in 2014 & then there was another ethics investigation into that ethics investigation in 2016. Investigating yourself is not ethical, but we're talking about Andrew Cuomo here. 

He's the same guy who partnered with the IDC to block his own party's legislative agenda because he preferred NY's GOP agenda.

The Nursing home scandal is on him, he cut NY Hospital budgets by $400 Million, & that negatively impacted the hospitals that served Black and Latinx neighborhoods.  

He sent COVID patients to nursing homes when the hospitals ran out of resources & beds knowing how contagious the virus was in March.

Then he proceeded to hide half of all COVID-related deaths in nursing homes for almost a year for no reason. There was no reason why he had to lie about the deaths in nursing homes during a pandemic.

But here's the real kicker, he gave nursing homes & their execs legal immunity from being sued. Those same executives proceeded to give Cuomo almost $2 Million in campaign donations for his re-election.

He should be impeached & then the FBI & AG should investigate how far his corruption goes and what else he's done."
2021-03-05 15:24:00,"It’s simple. If you claim to be basing policies on fact then you don’t get to hide or change the facts to make yourself look better.

2021-03-05 15:38:28,I can't defend what Cuomo did so I think people should just remember that Trump was worse and if more terrible revelations continue to come out I will have to admit that Cuomo is not really a Democrat but a Republucan.

2021-03-05 15:40:44,"So Cuomo and his admin misrepresented the number of COVID deaths, after the fact (obviously).  This is not the same as his 'causing' those deaths, and I'm tired of people trying to suggest  it is.  

Could Cuomo have handled the nursing home situation better, at the time?  Surely.  If he'd done things differently, might fewer nursing home residents have died?  Possibly.  But then,  the same could be said of every city, state, province, country throughout the world.  Folks seem to forget...last March-April, NYC was at the height of a totally new pandemic.  I'd like to see all the kneejerk haters out there, to have done a better job.

Everyone is so fickle and sheep-like nowadays, riding whatever the popular wave is, on social media.  Pre-COVID, most NYCers disliked Cuomo.  Then last March-May, these same folks were calling him our Guardian in Chief...that he should run for office.  Now, between somehow blaming him for all the nursing home deaths, and women making accusations of his acting 'inappropriately', suddenly he should be removed from office??

Look, I ain't saying he's a saint, but show me a politician who is.   None of us is perfect, nor should we expect anyone to be so.  Life can't be curated.  It's not all purely black or white,  much as so many NYT readers seem to want."

I'm pretty sure their relatives did not want them, infecting other family members. I imagine there was no staff to take care of these patients and probably no PPE either. And somehow Cuomo is held responsible for their deaths? 
I love how people who have never worked in nursing homes are always sitting in judgment. The nursing home is the performative outrage whipping boy of the self-righteous. Try working there sometime before you judge. Example: Staff your hall with one nurse and 2 aides. Outlaw protective restraints that ""rob patients of dignity"" and then demand an inquest when patients wander around, fall and break bones.

With this as a backdrop, the Democrats continued to venerate and look past Governor Cuomo's catastrophic policies and accuse President Trump and Governor DeSantis of crimes that were being committed by one of their own.

2021-03-05 16:26:33,He needs to go away.  Personally I think the harassment allegation do not appear worthy of removal-I know others see this differently but the nursing home allegations are inexcusable.
2021-03-05 16:35:28,"Had the numbers been reported accurately, would the nursing homes have received more emergency funding and staffing to protect patients and staff? Would that have reduced cases and deaths? Just curious. I didn’t see reference in the article, but might have missed it. As soon as Cuomo was put on a pedestal I was anxious — who comes out of pandemic stink smelling so good so early?"
2021-03-05 16:37:13,"The bigger scandal is after we knew how vulnerable the residents of nursing homes were, we still didn't take actions to truly protect them.  As recently as December, a third of Covid deaths were coming out of nursing homes.  We were paying hundreds of billions of dollars for airline workers to stay home but didn't have money to insure nursing home staff were safe,   The Covid response was coordinated as an emergency uncoordinated plan for 12 months.  At some point maybe we should have tried to rationalize the response."
2021-03-05 16:55:19,"What hasn't been made clear is how many nursing-home residents died of Covid. It would seem that relatively few would die in the nursing homes, because they would have been sent to hospitals and died there. Shouldn't these residents be counted as having died from Covid acquired in a nursing home?

Additionally, there isn't any clarity on the extent to which hospitalized Coved patients, who had presumably recovered, were inappropriately sent back to nursing homes causing Covid to spread."
2021-03-05 17:01:17,"People need to realize that the total number of deaths were accurate just the location of death, i.e. hospital, nursing home, home, etc, is what people are arguing about.  So will people please stop saying the count was inaccurate.  

Also, NYS reports  deaths of residents on congregate settings or nursing homes as place of death on a regular basis.  If a resident has a heart attack and dies in a nursing home it is a nursing home death, if a resident has a heart attack and dies in route to a hospital or in a hospital it is not counted as a nursing home death.  There are no federal guidelines and NYS has report cards/grades on nursing homes that report this data, so reporting all Covid deaths of nursing home residents as nursing home deaths would skew that data as well.  

As for sending residents with Covid back, this was CDC guidelines at the start of the pandemic because the economy was the concern at the national level.  Cuomo did say that the any nursing home who could not handle Covid care can let the state know and the state would take care care of that patient, but the nursing home would not get the monies for that resident while the state is taking care of the resident. 

It is truly a money trail, but the state followed it usual protocols and maybe there should have been an asterisk and footnote state hospital deaths include those from congregate settings. In the end the numbers are accurate unlike other states."
2021-03-05 17:02:58,"Lets get down to the bottom line numbers on this issue:
- As this article points out Cuomo followed the CDC guidance at the time when he issued an order preventing nursing homes from turning away people discharged from the hospital after being treated for Covid-19. The order was similar to ones issued in other states aimed at preventing hospitals from becoming overwhelmed.
- The NY Times has reported as of Feb. 26, 2021 that 34% of all US Covid 19 deaths were residents and employees of nursing homes and other long-term care facilities and that NYS's rate was 33%.  In the table with the NYT article  NYS falls in the middle of the states  for this statistic.
<a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/coronavirus-nursing-homes.html"" target=""_blank"">https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/coronavirus-nursing-homes.html</a>

So the bottom line is overall NYS's performance regarding nursing home deaths based on this statistic is about average for the country. It doesn't appear that Cuomo by his actions caused significantly higher nursing home deaths than experienced in other states.

Did Cuomo purposely in the report  understate the amount of NYS nursing home resident deaths associated with COVD 19 (both deaths in hospitals and nursing homes) or did the report instead state the lower nursing home resident deaths only in nursing homes.   The article isn't clear on this.   It would have helped if the article provided a link to the report and cited the page where this occurred since it is central to the entire allegation against Cuomo."
2021-03-05 17:06:53,"My father died of COVID May 5th in a Maryland nursing home. His death certificate lists: ""natural"" as cause of death. One wonders how many other instances like this occurred."
2021-03-05 17:27:13,"It gets little attention, but Gov. Cuomo failed to plan the rollout.  He was gone promoting his book and then through October and November, he was claiming he didn't trust the FDA (really Trump's fast-tracking) and would re-test any vaccine before allowing it to be administered to New York State residents.

And then the vaccine arrived as expected in December, and he immediately began lambasting Trump for not providing enough. (The message on the NYS vaccine registration phone line starts with a complaint about not getting enough vaccines.)

He ruled the rollout with an iron fist.  To defy his approved categories (Group A, B, etc.) meant swift punishment.  (He punished the New Rochelle hospital that vaccinated its health care workers out of turn.) Health care workers were running around frantically trying to find someone in the ""approved"" group to receive leftovers in vials.  He claims to have administered the majority of vaccines but Becker's Hospital Review places New York at 40th in its ranking of states' administration of vaccines allotted to them. 

New York State health care providers administer millions of vaccines each year.  New York health officials believed they were up to this job as well, but Gov. Cuomo was reluctant to turn over control to them."

He made mistakes and admitted them.  Dr. Levine answered every question, and was honest when she did not know.

Conversely, Governor Cuomo seemingly misled how bad things are at nursing homes, and that is criminally negligent, if it can be proved that his decisions led to an increase in deaths."
2021-03-05 17:51:08,"While I do not agree with the manipulation of the covid deaths I wonder out loud ""Where do you think the patients should have been sent if not back to the nursing home?"" Hospitals were overflowing in many areas and staff stretched too thin...Did the families volunteer to take their elders? Perhaps some did but I would guess most could not care for an elder parent or family member. The real issue is that nursing homes are not designed to isolate scores of people at one time. It is a simple, though not cost effective option to design them that way"
2021-03-05 17:53:31,"My question is, how do you know what proportion of nursing home transfers who died in hospital actually died as a direct result of COVID?  Elderly people who were sick enough for hospitalization and/or for a direct admit to the ICU generally had significant comorbidities.  Sifting through that, at the height of the pandemic, when staff were stretched to the limit was probably academic.  Secondly, when I was 25, I'm pretty sure I wouldn't have broached a discussion of past sexual history with a powerful alpha male boss.

2021-03-05 16:48:49,Why is this an issue? Gov. Cuomo should be former Gov. Cuomo. New York and New Jersey have the highest mortality rates from Covid and still they refuse to accept responsibility for their incompetence and failures that resulted in preventable deaths.
2021-03-05 16:59:39,"Trump knowingly hid the severity of this virus.  Cuomo knowingly hid the severity of the actual number of deaths in nursing homes.  Both did it for political expediency.  But what if Trump had been forthcoming in the severity of the pandemic from the beginning, had a national plan and worked to encourage people to accept & follow the science? 

Would we even be having this discussion?"
2021-03-05 17:06:42,"I am confused.  Why does this even matter?  At the risk of sounding callous, if they were dead,, they were dead.  Why would simply underreporting the number be so important?

Yes, he lied, and that's not a good thing.  But what adverse effect did it actually have on anyone?  I'm sure the families knew they were dead.  So what's this all about?

Cuomo did a better job than any governor of handling the pandemic,  He became more important to Americans than the president or his ""response team,"" and his daily briefings were watched by and were a model for the entire world.

I'm not happy that he lied.  Bad on him.  But please tell me how this is anything more than a kerfuffle that is being blown up into some sort of phony scandal.  Ever hear the phrase, ""Making a mountain out of a molehill?""

2021-03-05 17:39:51,"Yikes. Well I was willing to give Cuomo some room to maneuver his way through the asking young women out theatrics but cooking up nursing home death numbers, that’s a whole other ball game. 

We are in an era where truth is under assault and I can’t support a leader who assaults the truth. We’ve got enough Republicans who are already doing that.

What’s astonishing is there wasn’t a single person in his circle who could speak truth to power and tell him that the short term play was not worth it, sooner or later the truth would come out and it would harm him a lot more than poor performance on the nursing home front would."
2021-03-05 17:41:30,"You say ""Unlike other states, New York excluded residents who had been transferred to hospitals and died there, effectively cloaking how many nursing home residents had died of Covid-19.""  WHERE they died, not HOW MANY died.  So, no HIDING of DEATHS went on.   All nursing home residents that died of covid were counted, but the Cuomo team only reflected the nursing home residents that died in nursing homes.  It was left to the hospital to count the residents of nursing homes that spent their final days in hospital.  Example:  John Doe, resident of Said Nursing Home, died at Said Hospital  -- cause of death, covid.   The hospital counted this death.  Not the Cuomo administration. John Doe's death wasn't in their report because the hospital reported it.  This is vastly different than a claim that deaths were being hidden.  The state of New York had a report of all deaths caused by covid, as reported by hospitals and nursing homes."
2021-03-05 16:29:43,"Nice article. But it only insinuates, never clarifies, who gave the orders to change the numbers.

If it was Cuomo he must go, clearly.

But if it was only his staff the situation becomes more complex. It's then a question of how much did the Gov. know, what he was actually told, did he support the edits, was he aware of the width and breadth of them and so on.

Let's compare it to ""Bridgegate"". Despite knowing that Gov. Christie could be called a ""rascal"" at times I still believed him when he said into the camera that he didn't know what was going on. If _his_ staff tried to ""score points with the boss"" behind his back, why not assume the same happened to Gov. Cuomo?

Don't get me wrong: I'm all for a thorough investigation. But let's hang him afterwards (if proven guilty), now right now. And that bit about the women in this article, along with the evasive reporting on who gave what orders, makes me believe that the authors didn't want to wait that long..."

How did we get here? Gov. Cuomo has ignored the CDC statement that people aged 75 and up with a pre-existing condition such as cancer or asthma are at extremely high risk and must be vaccinated. Mr. Cuomo has ignored the needs of this high-risk group in New York City, which requires different planning than suburban locations where people are at less risk by being isolated in their cars while waiting on a car line for vaccination administered through an open car window. Mr. Cuomo's idea of a vulnerable 78-year-old taking the subway to Yankee Stadium for a shot is obscene and ultimately detrimental to NYers of all age groups. The city needs vax teams to vaccinate the CDC's identified high-risk elderly in their homes in order to address the health needs of this group and thus an essential part of the health needs of all.

2021-03-05 12:56:15,"If nursing home patients developed Covid, were transferred to hospital for treatment and then returned to a nursing home, how does that action facilitate spread within a closed environment  if the infection was already widely present in the nursing home to start?  I lived through this crisis in NYC; there was no “game plan” since we were ground zero for the outbreak. Cuomo was following Federal guidance. Let’s also be clear: no overall Covid deaths were under reported. What this discussion avoids is two elephants in the room: by focusing on whether a patient died in a nursing home or a hospital, our nation gets to avoid the uncomfortable but badly needed discourse on lack of adequate and humane elder care in America, how it has been parceled out to subcontractors taking care of our loved ones, and corporations trying to cut costs at any lengths. Further, this attack on Cuomo is really about forces trying to unseat him for going up against Trump when NYS had no assistance from our President at the outbreak of the pandemic. Perhaps you didn’t hear Trump say NYS would receive no vaccine shipments. Republicans would love to unseat Cuomo and try and put their man in. Yes, Cuomo’s actions towards women must be investigated, but the discussion of nursing home fatalities is akin to trying to put out a house fire with a garden hose."
2021-03-05 14:46:48,"Governor Cuomo followed federal guidelines as did other state Governors. The number of deaths is the same whether or not they are reported as nursing home deaths or deaths outside of the nursing home.

New York was hit by the virus before we knew it was here and this should be taken into consideration when reading numbers of deaths. Unfortunately, Governor Cuomo was under attack by President Trump, as were all Democratic leaders, and I'm sure this influenced the way the number of deaths were reported.

That being said, the number of deaths did not change even though they weren't classified that way into categories.  Governor Cuomo still did a great job leading NY down the mountain and that can NOT be taken away from him."

Remember who was at the helm.  Trump.  The truth denier in the flesh.  Think how he would have politicized this information to hold up his denial of the potency of this viral spread.  

Let's not forget the conditions we were living in back then. 

I'm not justifying Cuomo's decision, but I can understand the possible reasoning as to why.

And may I add, what's up with the recent hatchet job on the man?Does the media really need someone popular to villianize.
This reeks of a take down. 

Frankly I think Gov. Abbot in Texas should be under much more media and public scrutiny."
2021-03-05 11:14:32,"The truth is that Cuomo had no playbook in the first months of the pandemic and made a policy decision to protect hospitals that sent people who were released form the hospital to nursing homes. Nursing homes were under prepared - with staffing, with PPE, with any ability to separate sick patients. The specter of people trying ram through hospital doors and being turned away loomed large.

Fairly bad management and really bad staffing and logistics at nursing homes made Cuomo’s bad decision worse. 

He might have been forgiven if he’d admitted the error - and really who is surprised here? Reporters were grilling him and forcing him to defend and deflect in April and May - but he doubled down instead. The decision was a poor one, and a costly one, but one that Britain also made. In the giant hollow provided by the Federal government, New Yorkers suffered. A real roadmap from the Feds would have helped.

But Cuomo’s personality and the President’s made the lethal situation worse. New Yorkers in general were made safer by Cuomo’s demagoguery; he was the autocrat we needed. But the toxic presidency which set out to take credit for opening the economy, while placing blame on governors for suffering and death, put pressure on Governors to figure out how to deflect long enough to get their states under control. 

There is a lot of blame to spread here."

2021-03-05 19:18:29,Let’s also remember that after a large contribution from the nursing home industry he gave them civil liability immunity.
2021-03-05 12:05:57,"The total numbers of nursing home deaths should have been included in this report and obviously aides and the governor wanted to remove it because they thought it made them look bad. We have the numbers now though and they are consistent with statistics worldwide. 

The case fatality rate (or the infection fatality rate) for this virus increases dramatically with age. The CFR is roughly 100-fold higher for people 79+ than for people in the 30-39 age group, for example. Overall, 90% of deaths from this virus are 55+ in the US.

The people in nursing homes are elderly and infirm. The homes were woefully unprepared and ill-equipped to deal with a highly contagious and lethal virus. That is certainly not any particular governor’s fault. 

The governor should come clean about the underreporting and if any laws were broken, that should come to light.

But the far larger situations we should address are why most elderly lack the quality residential care they need? Why don’t we have universal health care? This pandemic has revealed the brutal inequities in our system that undermine the health of the poor, minorities and the elderly, which we as a society are ultimately responsible for.

I do understand that it is more convenient to blame others for our collective failings though."
2021-03-05 19:24:47,"Andrew Cuomo has dominated New York like an”Godfather”. It really wasn’t a secret that he operated like an old school Politician.
His performance during the”Pandemic” may have won him an Emmy but in reality it wasn’t  very effective.
The individuals and families who needed assistance the most received the latest and still do.
Unfortunately, for us New Yorkers we are stuck with a mediocre cast of candidates for both Governor and Mayor.
I really wouldn’t be surprised if Cuomo runs for a four term!"
2021-03-05 19:28:57,"I understand why Gov. Cuomo would want to fudge the numbers, because it would be a lead-pipe cinch that Trump would have used those numbers against him and do his utmost to smear his name. After all, at the time, the governor was much more trusted and much more popular than Trump, which, to Trump, is a cardinal sin. As understandable as it was, though, fudging the numbers was still the wrong thing to do. We expect that kind of duplicity from Trump, and from the Republicans in his thrall, but we Democrats are supposed to be better than that."
2021-03-05 19:38:38,"To further my argument. 
NPR: 
Cuomo has also faced criticism in recent days after an Associated Press report found that, in the early days of the pandemic, New York sent more than 9,000 recovering coronavirus patients from hospitals back into nursing homes."
2021-03-05 19:56:28,"Falsifying data is unethical plain and simple. Doing so as the elected leadership of a high-profile, high-population state during a global pandemic is unbelievably dangerous and undermines trust in our elected officials at an extreme level. I think his choices place him beyond mere apologies and promises about future behavior. As a Democrat in Illinois, which has a shameful history of corruption, I think there cannot be a double standard depending on party. He needs to step down."
2021-03-05 20:07:06,"Question for everyone in the downstate NY region who contracted Covid back in the Spring (I did not):

Can you say FOR SURE where you caught the virus? Who gave it to you? Not just a guess, or probably, but definitively. I’ll bet not many can. 

How is it then that some are SO sure that nursing home residents caught the virus from discharged patients returning from a hospital stay?

The state’s July report indicated that the asymptomatically infected NH staff was the likely factor as the primary source of exposure. They lived in the community, shopped in our grocery stores, etc. The same places where the families of NH residents lived, where the outside delivery workers lived, etc. How can we ever know exactly who brought the virus to NHs?

It was not anyone’s “fault” they somehow caught Covid, anymore than it was the “fault” of the nurses and doctors in the hospitals who contracted the virus. All of these brave healthcare workers were terrified of catching the virus, of bringing the virus home and into their workplace. 

Further, the CDC issued guidance on March 7 that stated “certain asymptomatic healthcare personnel exposed to others with the virus were ‘not restricted from work.’” The CDC didn’t even suspect at that time that asymptomatic people were likely to spread the infection. They didn’t even recommend testing NH staff then. 

CDC guidelines changed as we learned more about the virus, but Cuomo followed their guidelines at the time. Still does."
2021-03-05 20:05:37,"Dear readers: Once you get past the damning headline, several paragraphs, go deeper, and actually read the entire article, you will realize this is, at a minimum, a big nothing burger and at most, a deflated hot air balloon.  Are the three young accusers of an entirely separate story germane to the subject at hand and relevant to this article insofar as to justify their inclusion?  No, not really.  Tangentially, it's worth noting that two out of the three people involved in changing the report, i.e. the governor's top aide and the head of the state's Department of Financial Services are both women.  Women are a part of the governor's daily orbit without incident.  I wish the Times would not continue giving play to unsubstantiated hearsay of an immaterial (and immature) nature that simply isn't relevant nor important in the big picture and grand scheme of things.  He apologized like the class act that he is. Most of us have moved on from that subject; I wish the Times would, too."

Reinfection with COVID-19
Updated Oct. 27, 2020
Print
Cases of reinfection with COVID-19 have been reported, but remain rare​.​

In general, reinfection means a person was infected (got sick) once, recovered, and then later became infected again. Based on what we know from similar viruses, some reinfections are expected. We are still learning more about COVID-19. Ongoing COVID-19 studies will help us understand:"
2021-03-05 19:30:21,"If Cuomo resigns, lieutenant governor Kathy Hochul will become the first ever female governor of New York and leave California among the big states as the last bastion of all male governors."
2021-03-05 20:30:17,"One year ago, saying anything against the governor or his edicts would have resulted in ridicule and accusations of being a Trumper or worse, anti science. What a turnabout."
2021-03-05 19:49:29,"It’s funny, there was a moment where I thought Cuomo’s unbelievable political savvy might finally face a reckoning. He’s always been one step ahead, always completely crushing Deblasio, always in charge of the narrative.  I imagined a future “Power Broker” being written about him (although I can’t stand the guy and would never vote for him). 

Silly me for doubting him. He’s going to be fine. He’s still going to win. I can’t think of a more cunning political animal. Frightening."
2021-03-05 19:59:25,"The early days of the spread of the virus were filled with uncertainty -- a lack of understanding and conflicting advice about best practices.  Blaming Cuomo, or Trump, for not having a crystal ball, is just ignorant.  But certain critical decisions were made IN LIGHT OF the known science, not in a vacuum, and that is what Cuomo is being asked to account for.  I'm still waiting for someone to ask the Governor his reasoning for refusing the offered assistance of the naval vessel and the Javits Center at the height of NY's crisis.  Could it have been because of an unwillingness to accept help from Trump and be in a position of having to say anything positive about him or his administration?  The underlying political motivation of all of this is shameful, disgusting, criminal."
2021-03-05 19:31:01,"According to ProPublica (July 2020), Gov. Cuomo's order barred nursing homes from testing patients."
2021-03-05 19:47:24,"Kudos to NYTimes for staying on top of this story since April of 2020, even as CNN was fawning over Gov. Cuomo long after everyone knew of his disastrous decision-making errors."
2021-03-05 19:26:23,"This latest abomination from the Cuomo inner sanctum is reminiscent of Roger Stone protégé and political hack Michael Caputo flagrantly rewriting pandemic-related public health reports by CDC and HHS experts to conform with the lies emanating from the Trump White House.

If nothing else, Gov. Cuomo is well known for being a, pardon the expression, hands-on micromanager and control freak. So it's implausible that he wasn't aware of exactly how his close aides were cooking the books and fudging the numbers.

What's plausible indeed, based on his reputation, is that the changes were made under his direct orders to cover up enormously embarrassing truths for image-polishing purposes.

And given the ominous cloud of highly credible sexual harassment allegations by three young women so far, two of them in the workplace, is this governor worthy of public trust now, let alone for the fourth term he desperately craves? 

The answer is clearly no."
2021-03-05 19:33:37,"Aren't we told that it isn't the crime but the coverup that will take a politician down? Yes, Cuomo is a typical New Yorker. But that arrogance, rudeness, and nastiness does not play well out in the flyover country. He might survive in New York but less than a year ago, his name was thrown around as the savior of the Democrat party and a presidential contender. He might not be forced to resign or be impeached. He might even be reelected. But his influence has now dropped to exclusively NYC. Even the rest of NY state has soured on him."
2021-03-05 20:11:00,"Lest we forget, all of this happened while Gov. Cuomo was writing a book about how wonderfully he handled the pandemic.

Unclear whether this happened before or after his Emmy award."
2021-03-05 19:13:05,"I’m glad you are really delving into Cuomo’s handling of Covid. Last year while he was cavorting on TV with his brother, the media made him into a Star. Unbelievable that at one of the worst moments in our history, when a raging disease was killing so many, that was the role he adopted and you all encouraged the show! 
I was sickened by it. So many other governors going low key and yet getting better results and the media enlarges Cuomo’s persona. 
Now at least you are acting as the serious source of news that I appreciate. You are finally looking at facts. One issue really bother me, why didn’t he use the Comfort or the Javits Center? 
They seemed like a good option. 
If his decision was politically motivated, that is, not wanting to give Trump credit, that is even more egregious. 
That moment in history wasn’t and should not have been about politics. We should have seen a uniting to conquer Covid. The fact that we didn’t in NY and CA was sinful. 
Both of these governors have been shown to be the lowest life politicians. Similar behavior by Pelosi in holding up stimulus agenda so as not to give Trump any credit. 
We’ve sunk to a new low in politics in our country. I’m not necessarily Dem or Republican but rather I search for a person who can do something for our country. 
I’d love to see the NYT following those parameters and just report the facts. In the long run, personality doesn’t matter much. Deeds, accomplishments, positive moves count."
2021-03-05 20:55:48,"Yet republican governors lift mask mandates and basically sell vaccines to the highest bidder and no one seems to care. They should be asked to resign since what argue are doing is clear misleading the public and completely corrupt. Cuomo in the face of complete federal incompetency of the former president led NY through the toughest times and has built a foundation to take us forward .
I have asked this before why have these women come forward after this issue with the nursing home count? Why now ? Something in the timing seems off.  Investigate, get all the facts , then decide . Don’t Franken Cuomo."
2021-03-05 21:17:13,"So many people besides Cuomo are responsible for this. Many of the Deplorable Left in the media - people who are good with bombs on Syria and a unionless landscape, as long as the PC courtesies of the week are observed - were behind this establishment movement to give frightened suburban donors an alternative to the monster in Washington, on behalf of a Democratic Party that has been wholly captured by private enterprise."
2021-03-05 20:47:49,"If this is true, I hope they all go to prison. These people are disgusting and negated the lives of all the people who were killed by covid, and unrecognized by NY State."
2021-03-05 20:53:00,"Time to resign, Governor."
2021-03-05 20:44:51,"Time to go, Andrew. Enough is enough—this is an almost total picture of misfeasance. Yes he wasn’t as bad as Trump—is that all it takes to say that he is okay? I don’t think so—there’s something to be said for higher, or at least decent, standards."
2021-03-05 21:00:34,The book by Governor Cuomo needs to be rewritten with the new facts of cover up.
2021-03-05 21:35:24,I hope New Yorkers keep Cuomo in office.  He makes my governor look pretty good about now.
2021-03-05 21:41:19,"Remembering VP Gore saying, ""All political careers end in failure... "" or in jail, as is the case for Don Cuomo."
2021-03-05 22:08:21,"I cannot fault the Governor for the decision to place recovering patients in nursing homes. Tough decisions had to be made with little information to go on.  Little  was known about the disease,  who was the most at risk. The Governor didn't know  either at the time he made the order to accept recovering Covid patients. What I cannot forgive is the misleading reporting to health officials and inaccurate reporting of the deaths. At the time very little was known about the disease, death rates initially were in the 14% range. Horrific out of control and tough decisions needed to be made. Decisions on what was working and what was not. Information, ACCURATE information was needed by desperate health care folks trying to sort this pandemic out.  They did not get that from the Governor.  How many more died because of what, because bad numbers started  coming in from  NY nursing homes, so lets not tell the health folks they got the disease in the homes but died in a hospital. Why for Gods  sake?  Optics?  So the practice of placing Covid patients in nursing homes actual effect on the otherwise healthy nursing home residents  wasn't fully realized for what months? Sorry no excuse for that in my minds eye."
2021-03-06 00:30:32,"Looming in the background of all this is the thought that the Bill Clinton measure of balance is still very much present in political life. How many flaws are permissible in a clearly capable public figure?

I'm already thinking: whoever the next governor is, NY voters really need to get it right. In the present moment, there is no room for even the slightest deviation from a trustworthy and irreproachable path. 

Is there an unimpeachable individual who is also electable?"
2021-03-06 00:38:57,"The cover-ups (crimes of upholstery) invariably are more problematic (and easier to prove) than the problem themselves.  
This behavior is pretty inexcusable.

It does put the lie to the Trump supporters (they are still out there lying) claims that deaths were overreported to increase medical  reimbursements and make him look bad,"
2021-03-05 23:20:21,These comments are starting to read like Facebook Trolls.
2021-03-05 22:04:40,"""....none of the information released so far has changed the overall number of Covid-19 deaths in New York... ""

Why was the above phrase buried 18 paragraphs into the piece? If a reader only skims the headline and subhead, they may get a very different idea about the reporting."
2021-03-05 23:46:05,"A question for New Yorkers;

If De Blasio attempted to primary Andrew Cuomo, could he beat him?"
2021-03-05 21:42:48,"Just as a point of curiosity, would it be possible to also do an investigation of Florida governor Ron DeSantis and compare his actions with Cuomo's?

DeSantis has skewed Florida's Covid numbers from day one. He fired a state employee who refused to fudge the numbers for him. He sent police after her to seize her computers and phones because she was collecting data from a number of informants who were giving her real numbers and he wanted them shut down. 

DeSantis has resisted precautions to control the spread of Covid - Florida tourism is more important than saving lives. The state's vaccine roll-out has left minorities behind, to the point where his rich white supporters are getting preference. He threatened to shut down two vaccination sites after people complained about the blatant inequity of where they had been placed.

Why isn't this part of the story? Why not mention Kristi Noem, who as governor of South Dakota has refused to do anything to fight the pandemic, part of the GOP ""Death through Individual Freedom"" policy?

It's crazy, but I guess it's because neither Noem or DeSantis, or for that matter Abbott of Texas and Reeves of Mississippi have gotten caught up in sex scandals. Cuomo may have flaws as a leader, but it pales besides this."
2021-03-05 23:24:55,"I credit Gov. Cuomo with helping me get through the pandemic.  The leadership he offered in his daily new conferences made me, at age 83, New York smart and New York tough.  And not only me, but relatives of mine in several different states said that watching Gov. Cuomo's televised briefings helped them to understand what to do to survive the pandemic  when neither the federal government nor their own governors offered the necessary leadership.  As for the so-called nursing home death count,  I am confused.  According to what I've read, Cuomo is being blamed for counting nursing home residents who died in the hospital as hospital deaths and not nursery home deaths.  Why is that wrong?  In obituaries, it is usually said that a person who died in the hospital is said to have died in the hospital.  My mother died in a nursery home;  I would count her death as a nursery home death.  If she had died in the hospital, I would count that as a hospital death.
That has been the usual practice.  Why is it now different for people who died of COVID-19 in the hospital who had resided in a nursery home? 
Furthermore, as I understand it, it does not change the overall New York COVID-19 death count.  Gov. Cuomo, please do not resign.  We need you too badly.  And I say that as a civil-rights lawyer who represented women in sexual harassment and racial discrimination cases.

2021-03-06 01:55:22,This & the harassment allegations need to be carefully investigated.
2021-03-06 01:22:51,"Like former President Trump, Governor Cuomo is a self-centered, power-hungry, ego maniac who is more enthralled with doing right by himself than by the people.

Unlike former President Trump, Governor Cuomo has not garnered the support of ten of millions of people that will over looks the most egregious of transgression in their leader as he wildly, recklessly and even illegally pursues vain glorious ends just for the sake of his own petulant willfulness. 

On that basis alone, Cuomo will soon be out of office."
2021-03-05 12:57:39,"Bingo. This is a clearly superior ""engineering"" solution; a better choice of trade-offs. I wish I had waited - I'm in the Pfizer loop now . . . but just one shot. Big issue for me with IBS, GERD, allergies, anxiety issues is the reduced side-effects. In fact, data in UK indicates just one shot of Pfizer is 80% effective in stopping the virus spread among oldsters. This is not a black-and-white situation. We did this in a year but what we have is an experiment, not an optimized solution."
2021-03-05 13:09:42,"Governor Wolf in PA is prioritizing the first doses of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine for teachers and educational staff. Personally, I am thrilled. I have been working with maskless young children with disabilities in multiple school buildings since July, and I have not been able to get the vaccine. I understand there are many others who have not been able to get it either. The arrival of this vaccine makes me cautiously optimistic about the pace picking up."
2021-03-05 13:20:12,"How about sone vaccine diplomacy?  Will the US stop hoarding vaccines and share with Canada (who will approve J&J shortly) or keep harming their NAFTA partners and best allies? Remember that the whole point of NAFTA was to rationalize the continental economy so that each nation did what they were most efficient at. The US got the bulk of the pharma industry in that deal, but then a global pandemic hits and it's all ""America First"". Canada has no pharma manufacturing and too small of a population to have much leverage despite trying for months to buy every vaccine in sight. the US could do a lot to repair the damage under Trump by allowing Merck and J&J to send some vaccines north to the country that still happily sells the US electricity, oil, auto parts, uranium, etc."
2021-03-05 13:27:41,"The push is on. This is the third emergency vaccine approved for emergency use. Biden wants schools opened , states want business' re-opened, and people want to go back to pre virus living standards, and no masks. We want covid classified as another 'flu' variant where we may be inoculated every 6 months...who knows for sure? No one. But re-open seems to be the big push today. Hopefully it works out for us all. We will find out by late spring early summer for sure."
2021-03-05 13:33:09,"Although I'm not sure if the science checks out, logically, having a large diversity of available vaccines  should be a good thing. It means we will have back-ups if future mutations of the virus render some of them less effective or useless. As the article states, the temperamental nature and production difficulties with the mRNA vaccines may make the Johnson & Johnson the vaccine of choice for getting humanity up to herd immunity."
2021-03-05 13:43:05,"What bothers me is the fact that no one has had a choice as to which vaccine you'll get. As far as I know, you can make an appointment (if you can find one!), then you show up and get what you get. 
I disagree that the difference in efficacy is slight - a 20% - 25% difference does not sound slight to me. Again, it's not as if anyone actually is given a choice as to which vaccine they'll get, but if I did, I'd definitely choose the one with a 95% efficacy rate."
2021-03-05 13:48:25,"We are still in a race with the COVID variants — with an uncertain outcome. In the best interest of all of us, it would be beneficial to take whichever vaccine is offered sooner.

I will."
2021-03-05 13:56:16,"I have to say, the adverse reactions to the second dose have not been a picnic. If the J&J vaccine avoids that sort of reaction, then yes, it'll be great."
2021-03-05 13:58:17,"I already had my first shot and am getting my second next week.  I hate needles and would have preferred one shot but due to age and a pre-existing condition I think Moderna or Pfizer is better.  For those who are younger and not deemed high risk, J & J should be fine.  Make sense?"
2021-03-05 14:01:41,"""Some will view it as inferior."" It appears that it is. Americans read 72% vs 94% and think, ""Why would I want this one?"" Worldwide efficacy for the J&J brand is only 66%. If the J&J shot is truly as helpful as the others, Americans need a crash course in statistics and virology. Most of us aren't scientists. Our education program has been conflicted at best. Scary pictures of needles in arms and berating us for misunderstanding is no way to get us to comply. As for convenience, Americans may view this as the government taking shortcuts with our health. Most vaccine recipients desire the best possible protection and are willing to get two shots. We should at least have the option of taking the other brands."
2021-03-05 14:03:26,"As someone who has an intense needle phobia, even after successful treatment, I will go after getting the J&J vaccine as best as I can - I have a notoriously bad track record on followups and booster shots, though I aim to keep my vaccinations up to date.  Additionally, the vaccine hysteria and extensive news coverage has been difficult for people like me, and frankly made the anticipation of getting vaccinated far worse."
2021-03-05 14:11:58,"I would have preferred to have a choice. I don't mind doing two shots, and I would prefer the highest rate of effectiveness. Of course all of this may be moot if the mutations render all of these vaccines less effective."
2021-03-05 14:16:05,"What I don't see - and what is sorely needed - is the federal government to speak out with a single consistent message - massively and simply - and explain the benefits of getting the vaccines. There should be PSA's coming out of our ears on TV, spokespeople everywhere relaying the same messaging. I'm quite frankly shocked this is not happening."
2021-03-05 14:29:09,"They are finding J&J is very effective. Even increases its effectiveness as time passes. Too bad the initial announcement gave the wrong impression.

I will be overjoyed to take whichever vaccine I’m offered."
2021-03-05 14:30:17,Idk. It sounds strange that the vaccine that was once not that great comparatively is now good enough. I only say this as someone who has had long haul pneumonia symptoms for 6 months afterward. I don't want to go through that again no matter how mild and non hospital it is...
2021-03-05 14:51:23,"Here is the relevant crash course in statistics.  
Postulate 1: 95% (Moderna, Pfizer) is better than 72% (J&J).
Postulate 2: 72% is much better than 0% (No vaccination).
Postulate 3: If the 95% and 72% are not directly comparable because  ""companies’ trials were conducted in different places at different times,"" then the 72% figure is just as likely to be too high as too low.  The same is true for 95%.
Maxim: A bird in the hand is better than two birds in the bush.
My conclusion: Take the 95% version if it is available as early as the 72%.  Otherwise, as is usually the case, take a 72% option.  Otherwise you may be in the hospital still waiting for the 95%."
2021-03-05 14:53:15,"If I'm not mistaken, I recall some literature suggesting that the J&J vaccine may be more effective against several of the now-known mutants. If that's the case, it may be advantageous."
2021-03-05 14:54:13,"I can get the J&J tomorrow.  Or, as an educator I will shortly have a  chance at a clinic run just for the schools in a week or two.  A) Definitely J&J B) Brief wait and chance at Pfizer.  24 hours of torment lie ahead of me.  I may cancel the J&J appointment, but only with the awareness that another chance is right ahead."
2021-03-05 14:54:25,"It seems to me that the J&J vaccine would be great for some of the population. I would think that the homeless and migrant workers are unlikely to reliably return for a second vaccination. Also, I have read that those who have has COVID are better off with one vaccination. Perhaps this is the answer for this population?  There are so many unknowns, but one known fact is that expediency in vaccinating the largest number of people is paramount.   Hopefully, the majority of the population will opt for vaccination.  I have encountered many individuals (some older) who do not plan to get any of the vaccinations because they claim they are healthy and never get sick.  It must be nice to never get sick."
2021-03-05 14:56:00,"These are strange times. Among my medical colleagues, we were straining to decide what vaccine from the past to current is fully efficacious as a single shot. Almost none. Flu shots should be paired. Childhood shots are multiple. Hepatitis shots are multiple. Most international travel shots are multiple. So, what I suspect (my opinion) is this: the J&J immunization will be effective for the short run. But I’ll bet we will find the paired vaccines will provide longer term efficacy. What I mean as paired is either the Moderna or Pfizer vaccine as designed, followed in efficacy by having had COVID 19 PLUS one shot of any vaccine, followed in efficacy by single shot vaccines and those who get COVID and have no follow-up vaccine. That seems to be where the data is going, and where what we know of the coronavirus family is capable of."
2021-03-05 15:00:19,"The J and J vaccine may be more convenient because it doesn't require low temperature cold storage and only requires one jab, but it is, fact, inferior to the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines. From everything I have read the J and J vaccines is about 65 percent effective compared with Moderna and Pfizer which are in the mid nineties."
2021-03-05 15:14:14,"I've read reports that Johnson & Johnson (J&J) is studying whether or not a booster shot will increase effectiveness. I'm curious to see how J&J would compare with Pfizer and Moderna after two doses. That would be more of an apples to apples comparison in my mind. Regardless, I will take whichever vaccination is available to me first. Any protection is better than none at all."
2021-03-05 15:21:25,"If effectiveness rates can't be compared, why mention them at all? I don't believe they mean nothing considering many drugs are never marketed due to unacceptable effectiveness levels. The numbers must mean something. Pharmaceuticals is largely a quantitative science. It's all about the statistics."
2021-03-05 15:29:06,"I'm confused about the EUA for the J&J. Emergency Use Authorization is specifically for high risk individuals for whom the risks of a shot without long-term data are potentially lower than the risks of the disease itself. In this case, it means the elderly and those with underlying conditions. The J&J seems efficacious for the general population but not so much for high risk individuals.  That would make it eligible for regular FDA approval when it has sufficient data but not for EUA."
2021-03-05 15:40:01,"I would take it today if it was offered to me.

As it is, I will be one of the last vaccinated in my state because I do not have an urgent need.

That's fine with me. I'd rather that people over 65, teachers, front-line workers, college students, and seniors in high school get it."
2021-03-05 15:53:10,"Important to note that just one shot of the J&J vaccine is significantly more effective than just one shot of the other vaccines.  I might guess that a second J&J shot could make it more comparable to the others, although I've seen nothing on that."
2021-03-05 15:56:35,"Living in a remote area we were understandably only getting Moderna. I was not even allowed to get in the registration queue until this week and was told it would still be a month or more until I would get an appointment. I consoled myself with the fact that we'd likely be getting the J&J at that point due to the easier storage and I would only have one jab. Thanks to no shows and answering an unknown number on my phone I got Moderna yesterday. I'm happy but it is ironic that the time frame for me to be fully protected will be about the same as if I got the J&J in a month instead of a second Moderna. Take what you can get people. They all will push the virus out of the population, slowing the spread and lowering everyone's risk of exposure and illness."
2021-03-05 16:01:40,"After much effort getting on multiple lists and dealing with shortages, I got the first dose of the Pfizer vaccine last week. Now I need to worry about getting the second shot and making sure I get signed up for the Pfizer and not one of the other two. At least the supply situation seems to be easing so it shouldn't be as much of a hassle. My preference was for the Pfizer but the J&J would have simplified things and I would have gladly taken that one if offered."
2021-03-05 16:11:39,"If 100% of us got a vaccine that is 72% effective, our problems would be solved. Isolate the few cases that pop up the next few months and POOF.. We're back to worrying about seasonal flu."
2021-03-05 16:30:49,At 72 I have been waiting patiently for my turn.Got an appointment at at our local hospitals inoculation center. 730 AM time frame.Much to my surprise J&J had just been delivered the night before.All stations were giving J&J inoculations. One and done ! Thank You so much Lowell General staff and volunteers.The country is back working for the good again..
2021-03-05 16:41:25,"The argument that I hear from epidemiologists is that J&J, like Pfizer and Moderna, have had no deaths in the study groups. But for an individual, the concern is not just death but morbidity - a horrible illness with possible difficult long term issues to deal with. Nobody is talking about that which I find a little disingenuous because it is a real problem that has been discussed in this paper in many articles.

So for me, as an individual, the best way to avoid morbidity with Covid is to not become infected, and efficacy is the measure of that. The exact relationship between long term effects of Covid and any of the vaccines is an unknown at this point, but you cannot get around the fact that with Pfizer an individual has better odds at not getting infected than one does with J&J, and if I am not infected, I won't have to deal with long-haul Covid. 

In other words, if I walk into the clinic and they offer me a choice between Pfizer and J&J, I am taking Pfizer. If I have no choice, I will take what they have."
2021-03-05 16:43:10,"Question: I believe J&J comes in vials with more doses than Pfizer or Moderna.  Given the storage requirements of the first two, once the vial is used for one patient, the whole vial needs to be used in a brief time period.  Can a vial of J&J br used for one patient and returned to the refrigerator/  This could make it easier for smaller pharmacist to give shots to patients over multiple days, instead of having to treat all of their potential patients in fixed time periods?."
2021-03-05 16:49:23,"They need to do another trial that either mimics the conditions of the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines, or do a head to head comparison in the same conditions. No matter how much they try to explain it away, the bottom line is that people will see 70% vs 95% and that will cause them to shun the apparently less effective vaccine. It’s already happening. We just got a shipment of J&J and people are snatching up all the M and P appointments but almost nobody wants the J&J. If their goal is to get everyone vaccinated, they need to demonstrate WHY there isn’t massive inequity in these vaccines. Otherwise people will hold out."
2021-03-05 16:56:33,"The most important part of this story was left out:

This is the same tech as the more effective Russian vaccine “Sputnik V” registered in August last year.  The Johnson&Johnson/Astra-Zeneca vaccines are like the first shot in the Sputnik vaccine and give the same results.  There is a second shot in the Sputnik series using a different adenovirus strain that boosts its effectiveness to or above the Moderna vaccine. This was available last August. And it doesn’t require special refrigeration!

The entire ongoing debacle surrounding the US response to the virus, particularly vaccines, has seen political ends trump public health needs at every turn.  Washington’s aggressive foreign policy denied Americans an effective, possibly the best, vaccine.  To what end?  Russia is the big bad enemy!  Cold warriors are not all dead yet and need something to do.  The military industrial complex can still milk taxpayers for weapons systems.  Russia also provides a distraction from the problem too big to address and patently a mortal threat to the US and anything resembling Enlightenment values- China."
2021-03-05 17:01:57,"Since all the studies are on the frontier of evidentiary orthodoxy in the hurry of Covid 19, it doesn't seem plausible that one is better than the other. Throw in the mutating virus and the difference perception shrinks more. We may be in the market for a booster in the medium term future. So take what they're giving and like it."
2021-03-05 17:14:21,"This pandemic and the lack of preparedness, such as the current shortage of syringes to give vaccinations and PPE earlier, point to the need for more items in the ""strategic reserve"" than just oil and military items.
 
We know, sure as can be, there will be other pandemics and if our governmental bodies learn anything from this deadly fiasco, it's needs to be prepared.

Alas, I do not have much hope. Our Federal government does not seem to be able to think or plan for outliers for this to happen. For another example, what exactly have the states and the feds done, in actual steps or policies, to prepare for climate change and sea level rising? Will this just end up like insuring, with federal flood insurance, homes built in flood plains? A program that pays homeowners, who have predictably lost their homes to flood, to rebuild their homes in the same location? Would it not be better to condition the payment, and maybe add in some incentive, to relocate?"
2021-03-05 14:01:45,"This is an actual vaccine, unlike the BioNTech and Moderna injections which are technically gene therapy products.
The little research we have indicates that traditional, vector-based vaccines will have better immunity memory retention.
The Astra-Seneca vaccine (also vector based) has received such bad reporting- similar to the Sputnik V - that they are giving them to anybody who wants it in Germany.
If I have a choice I would opt for the J&J vaccine.
People over 65 better stick with one of the mRNA-based gene therapies."
2021-03-05 16:56:58,"People should calm down about which vaccine. Most likely, this is not the only Covid shot you will get. May end up having to do them annually, like the flu. This is only the first. Why quibble?"
2021-03-05 13:13:32,"Just as an aside, other, than J&J, why not bring in the Russian and the Chinese vaccines as well, be it in finished vials, or the license to produce them?
The more, the merrier, no?
Or the 'make even more money for our own big pharma' is still the main motive here?"
2021-03-05 15:10:44,Three vaccines means we are closer to returning to normal.
2021-03-05 17:11:15,"What is needed is a marketing campaign. The science is important but it needs to be ""sold"" in a way that people are convinced to ""buy"" and pleased with their ""purchase."" I don't mean a con-job--clearly that would be harmful.  I mean give people information and reasons to get vaccinated in general; and explain in simple terms why the J&J is just fine. For example. instead of the comparison among the Covid vaccines show them that the ""flu"" vaccine they get yearly (this past year there was a drive for that) is not anywhere near 95% effective. (anywhere from 40-70% maybe, depending on the type of flu--and it works well to keep flu ""at bay.""  Highlight other vaccines that are yearly or require boosters. Even with the 2-shots, they might need another one later. It sounds better than comparing efficacy rates.  Show, in simple visuals and language the risk comparisons between getting the vaccine and getting Covid.  Employ an easy to remember, easy to repeat slogan.  Not everyone is a NYT reader, deep thinker or has the analytical skills or brain power to understand the science, or the time and interest to research and learn. Sales 101: establish the need; demonstrate the consequences of not getting it; give the benefits of getting it. Easy, safe, and it works!"

2021-03-05 15:14:52,"Sine the J&J vaccine is different from the mRNA vaccines made by Moderna and Pfizer it may actually be better at preventing infections by new mutants. There is no published data to support this, but anything is possible with a ""novel"" virus. Due to the mutability of RNA viral genomes focusing on the mRNA of a single spike protein  may allow the virus to mutate itself around this small part of the viral genome and make the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines ineffective. Just speculating here, But???"
2021-03-05 16:47:43,"Hoping to see J&J around central coast soon. Not just the one shot but good record with little or no danger of the really bad form of  COVID.

2021-03-05 15:05:56,I wonder what the effects would be if you took the J and J vaccine and then the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine? Has anyone seen a study on this??? Would you be 100 percent safe???
2021-03-05 13:07:32,"""no one who got Johnson & Johnson’s vaccine had to go to the hospital for a Covid-19 infection 28 days or more after getting an injection. Sixteen people who got the placebo did. That translates to 100 percent efficacy, with a confidence interval of 74.3 percent to 100 percent.""

The J & J vaccine should NOT be shortchanged because of its advertised overall efficacy rate of 72 percent.

The J&J vaccine appears to prevent severe symptoms of the coronavirus in almost all people.

It's a good, convenient, effective one-shot vaccine."
2021-03-05 15:05:15,"Information has travelled in such a convoluted and harmful way during this crisis. Let me ask a question. What is our concern about the virus, getting it or getting very sick and potentially dieing  from it? Apparently the vaccine is not as good in preventing the spread but superb in preventing hospitalization and death. In my view it is a great option.  
We know that over 99 percent of those who got the virus had mild to no symptoms.  But we have worked hard to protect those for whom it is deadly. So once they are no longer at risk of death due to a vaccine we are moving in the direction of normalization. 
I don’t understand why even the Times continues to distort stories about the virus by treating it as a threat to everyone when we now have over whelming data it is not. In addition why is the vaccine treated with such mild optimism and the impression given that it won’t be enough (due to variants which by the way have not proven yet to be a deadly as first claimed, as all claims begin with it could ....and then 2 weeks later we learn it doesn’t but no one reports that!).  More balanced reporting would have saved many from the fear that has gripped them for
Months"
2021-03-05 14:56:11,"""Since Johnson & Johnson revealed data showing that its vaccine, while highly protective, had a slightly lower efficacy rate than the first shots produced by Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech......it has a lower overall efficacy rate in the U.S. — 72 percent, compared with roughly 95 percent for the others "" HOW IS THIS ""SLIGHTLY LOWER?"""
2021-03-05 16:04:45,"I’d happily get the J&J vax this instant, as a person near the bottom of any eligibility list."
2021-03-05 16:14:09,"the truth is we don't really know how J&J drug works at 66% the bar has been set pretty low. We still don't know how long these drug will work and how long will we need a shot every year, do these drugs block you from passing on the virus. Simply their been no real research, does the virus attach it self to fruits and veggies, what temp to kill on meat and fish since so many food workers got sick at the processing factories.
IF we gave billions to companies to make the drugs why are drug companies making record profits on this.
The big problems is we have every company but the Sackler & Purdue family/Pham working on this, will this turn out a them to make up the billions in fines for pushing Opioids, when all these companies include the biggest drug pushes walgreen/CVS should be doing this for Free"
2021-03-05 17:01:49,Well I am making a concerted effort to get the J&J since it’s being offered along with the other two at three (3) mass vaccination sites here. I do not think it’s inferior and I am not scared of jabs.
2021-03-05 12:55:29,"Surely voicing the negative makes it a topic for discussion...and probably wakens more negativity than the response that SHOULD be nation-wide, that is ""HURRAH!  ONE AND DONE!""   (I wish up here in  Canada but we won't have it any time in the near future)"
2021-03-05 14:01:58,"Most of the logistical manufacturing and distribution problems associated with all the new --and very effective-- Covid-19 vaccines could be obviated  by the development and use of an oral or  probiotic vaccine. The technology is now available and has been tested in animal models of infection.  It would involve inserting the gene that encodes for viral spike protein -- the same gene used in the mRNA vaccine-- into a harmless lactobacillus that can be ingested as a  food (yogurt) or given as a probiotic pill to  stimulate the host mucosal immune system -- the largest mass of lymphoid cells in the body -- to make abundant amounts of antibody specific for the spike protein for a long period of time. Such a vaccine would be cheap, not require the use of needles, syringes, gloves, or trained personnel to administer,  available to all, and not require a cold chain. It's a no brainer.!!  Also, such a vaccine could be modified easily to adjust for new emerging variants of the virus."
2021-03-05 16:07:32,"Get vaccinated so we can get back to normal

All the vaccines work. Vaccination should be a requirement of employment in coming months."
2021-03-05 16:22:12,"It's worth mentioning that the J&J vaccine is likely to be much less inflammatory and have fewer side effects than the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines.  Pfizer and Moderna are mRNA vaccines using lipid nanoparticles as carriers.  Even without the  mRNA inside them encoding for a viral protein, the lipid nanoparticles themselves are going to create a strong immune response (i.e., unpleasant side effects) as they are essentially a ""foreign body"" that can enter any cell. The J&J vaccine is a DNA vaccine using an inactivated adenoviral vector, which is a more standard vaccine technology.   (Adenoviruses are extremely common ""cold""  viruses.  They are something that your body has been exposed to many times, as opposed to a lipid nanoparticle which it has never seen) While you could still get mild side effects like with any vaccine, the more severe and unusual side effects that pop up with the mRNA vaccines are very unlikely."
2021-03-05 16:44:18,"It is not merely that some people will ""view"" the J&J vaccine as inferior......it IS inferior.

Repeatedly, the politicians and doctors tout that it prevents severe infections and death with 85% efficacy (they downplay that it prevents all infection with 72% efficacy).

But the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines prevent all infection with about 94% efficacy and prevent severe infection 100%.

Remember that all those doctors and politicians got their first priority vaccinations back in December......and all got the superior vaccines, either the Pfizer or Moderna.  But they want the public to believe that the J&J is good enough for them."
2021-03-05 16:06:46,"Sure, I'd take the Once-son and Done-son vaccine, given the chance!"
2021-03-05 16:17:30,Touting a vaccine with a 25% lower efficacy rate is unethical.
2021-03-05 14:03:46,"This story doesn't answer the key question: Is the J&J vaccine inferior? 

OK, efficacy rates may not be comparable because the tests were done at different times. Does that mean they are meaningless? 

Is someone who gets the J&J vaccine more likely to get sick from Covid than someone who gets one of the others with higher efficacy? Answer the question."
2021-03-05 13:07:15,I hope the vaccine is offered soon to younger people. I want my son vaccinated. Johnson and Johnson is good enough.
2021-03-05 14:18:59,"I’ll take the J&J vaccine.

Whatever it takes to protect all of us."
2021-03-05 16:26:26,"So we finally have vaccines and a good swath of the population balks because 1) they don't trust science 2) the Church tells them the vaccine is linked to abortion 3) Trump tells them it's all a hoax anyway and 4) they don't like needles. Well, all i can say is, get out of the way. I will take your spot gladly."
2021-03-05 14:25:51,I definitely view it as inferior and would prefer Moderna or Pfizer.
2021-03-05 15:05:23,"It’s all good news. The sooner we all get vaccinated the better for everyone.

My concern is the continued war against masking.  Just because you got the shot doesn’t mean you don’t need a mask.

A 48 year old healthy and fit woman that I work with died on Tuesday, in Mississippi, from covid.  She was getting better and then she suddenly died.  That could happen to anyone.  

Masks save lives and not just your own."
2021-03-05 16:32:37,I want to take the J&J now.  I think it is the best approach for me.  Please allow me to receive this vaccine in my home. (hopefully as soon as possible).
2021-03-05 14:33:40,"Yes we need PSAs to push people to get whichever shot they can get.

Dolly Parton’s video showing her getting a shot was brilliant and should be converted into 30 second spots and constantly broadcast in every medium. What she said was brilliant. She knows how to communicate well."
2021-03-05 16:52:35,I find it ironic that the Johnson & Johnson vaccine needs but one dose while the others need two. Moderna should now be Moderna Moderna and Pfizer the same. At the moment I am simply Jonesing for the Johnson.
2021-03-05 12:56:10,"We prefer the Johnson & Johnson vaccine, not because it is one shot, but because of the way it is designed.

The Moderna and Pfizer vaccine use mRNA to deliver bits of genetic code to cells.  This code tells cells how to make 
 a harmless piece of the spike protein that sticks out of the surface of the coronavirus. The immune system then learns to recognize the spike protein and fight it.

The Johnson & Johnson vaccine, on the other hand, is a viral vector vaccine, the same technology that's been proven safe and effective in creating an Ebola vaccine.  They use an inactive virus to deliver the genetic blueprint of the protein spike to cells, so the immune system will learn to recognize that spike when it runs into the coronavirus.  This, I am told, is how most traditional vaccines work; no tampering with the RNA necessary."
2021-03-05 17:44:53,"I think it is wonderful that we have more vaccines available in US.
However, it doesn't seem to me that efficacy of J&J vaccine is only slightly lower than Pfizer's or Moderna""s.
Overly enthusiastic articles and statements are ground for more vaccine hesitancy and avoidance.
I think I can handle the truth. If you carefully read the article, you can see that many healthcare providers see this vaccine as especially suitable for certain population, those who might not come back for second shot, people who live in rural areas and so on.
I would not think J&J is the best option for those who travel internationally ( with perhaps an exception of travel to South Africa if you must), as it's efficacy globally is 66%.
We are racing against time with the virus, more people vaccinated, less mutations and more immunity.
Is supply of J&J vaccine going to breach the gap? For now it doesn't seem that production capacity is sufficient."
2021-03-05 17:58:24,"At 67 years-old, I waited my turn and will get my second Pfizer shot next week at State Farm Stadium. I would have no qualms in also taking a J&J shot in the fall when they become abundant. From all I've read and learned, it seems all three current vaccines are all reasonably effective- amazing for about a year. 

Here in Arizona the shots seem to available to all who meet the age or worker criteria, regardless of whether they're US citizens, snowbirds or undocumented. We were asked for our age, name, and address when I signed up. If you didn't have insurance, it didn't seem to matter. I signed up for my wife and didn't have her Medicare information, and she wasn't asked for either her ID or her Medicare card when we checked in for our first dose. We just handed them our email confirmations. The whole process we did was drive through and it did not appear that anyone was asked to provide more than their appointment number confirmation. Since we were on a line of cars, I watched what was happening with other drivers and passengers. The volunteers were simply wonderful!

My guess is we'll all end up needing boosters to the current vaccines, much like the flu shots most of us take annually. If my count is correct, over the years I've had three shingles shots, three pneumonia vaccines, and many flu shots."
2021-03-05 17:36:17,"""... experts worry some will view it as inferior.""

It literally is, in fact, inferior to the two-shot vaccines in everything other than number of doses required. Don't blame me for recognizing that."
2021-03-05 18:17:48,"The article repeats the canard that you can't compare the efficacy results for J&J and the other two vaccines. Actually, there was a recent large study done in Israel that found the Pfizer vaccine had efficacy values above 90%, replicating the results from the original small study. This study allows more direct comparison. Pushing the J&J vaccine for the general population is good public policy but as an individual I'm happy to be getting the Pfizer vaccine."
2021-03-05 16:33:50,"Why is everybody in the USA calling this the J&J vaccin?
In fact it is developed by Jansen in the Netherlands!
Yes, it is a affilate of J&J, but should it not be mentioned at least as the J&J&J vaccine?"
2021-03-05 18:42:30,"It’s encouraging to hear that so many people are eager to accept the Johnson & Johnson vaccine. ￼Regarding efficacy, it has been noted that the Johnson and Johnson trials were conducted in the presence of a number of variants that were not in circulation at the time that Moderna and Pfizer vaccines were tested. It was also designed to be given as one dose because of its strength. 

With that in mind, we don’t know which vaccine will wind up being most broadly effective in the presence of new variants. It also may be that a booster shot of the Johnson and Johnson would make it even more effective than two doses of the others.￼￼

For now, it’s important to quickly tamp down the number infected people using whatever reasonable means we have to reduce mortality and limit the incubation reservoir for new strains. 

I am sure that we will learn a lot in the coming months about what works best and how to go forward. It’s possibly we will need booster shots on an annual basis.￼.. For now, it’s good to get as many people vaccinated as possible￼."
2021-03-05 19:29:15,The CDC has reported that J&J is very effective at keeping you out of the hospital and funeral home but not as effective at keeping you from getting covid. This is fine for young healthy people with a long life ahead of them but not good for elderly where every day of good health gets more and more valuable.
2021-03-05 23:25:07,"The J&J vaccine is a bit more than two-thirds as effective as the others, as best we can tell.  The fact that the studies were not identical casts some doubt on this, but it is the best information we have. The waves of happy talk coming from the government and the medical profession can't change the facts, only spin them.

We are told that the J&J vaccine is very good at keeping us alive and out of the hospital.  That is excellent.  However, we are also hearing a lot about ""long-haul"" COVID which affects a substantial number of patients who are not hospitalized.  These people have to cope with COVID-like symptoms for months--maybe years.  Nobody knows.

The upshot of all this is that the J&J vaccine presents a substantially higher risk that the person will get sick.  What happens then has not been studied.  But if you work this out, I think you'll conclude that nobody who has a choice should take the J&J vaccine.  Most of us will not have a choice, at least for a long time.

J&J is looking into whether a booster will increase its efficiency.  I certainly hope so."
2021-03-05 23:38:37,"I'm under 65, have no health issues, and am not at increased risk of catching or spreading the virus.  I would prefer the J&J vaccine, because it's just one shot and the protection is good enough for me."

Go online, scroll through the sites where vaccines are being administered and make your appointment.  Ad as you look at the sites, they show what vaccine(s) are being offered at that location.  We wanted the J&J vaccine and when it became available this week, we made our appointment and drove through a well managed process, received the vaccinations in the car and after a 15 minute observation wait, came home.  In 4 weeks, we can get back to an almost normal life."
2021-03-05 23:36:35,"News on the J&J vaccine is a whitewash, pure and simple. The vaccine was reported to be as low as 36% effective in people >60 with high blood pressure.

VE means vaccine effectiveness. I am 63, with high BP, so the vaccine is very unreliable for me.

2021-03-06 01:09:59,I am grateful for the Johnson and Johnson vaccine. I received it today here in New Jersey today at a Shoprite pharmacy. I was unable to use the Modern or Pfizer because of the ingredient polyethylene glycol that is in both of these vaccines. It is not an ingredient in the J and J. I had a past reaction to this ingredient and my allergist advised me to wait for the J and J. Luckily as a senior in New Jersey and the fact that Shoprite gives you a choice when signing up for an appointment I was able to go to the one that had the J and J. Since this is a known issue discussed on the CDC site I am disappointed that no J and J was allocated for those of us who needed to only get the J and J. Thank you Johnson and Johnson and Shoprite!

2021-03-04 16:49:22,"Great story. I have been waiting for a news organization to cover this subject. Are the funeral homes experiencing a rise in profits or do they have to use a great deal of their revenue to pay for  more expenses - trucks, staff, hearses, and sanitizing equipment?

I also wonder how the funeral industry is dealing with the crisis here in Chile. I haven't heard or read anything like this happening here and I've actually been to the cemetery during the past year and haven't seen a higher than usual level of activity. By law bodies must be buried no later than 48 hours after the death (bodies are not embalmed here) which adds to the urgency but maybe also helps not to create the ""jam"" described here.

During NY's peak less than a year ago, hundreds of Covid victims were being held in refrigerator trucks because funeral homes could not handle the volume of deceased.

In addition what about the mental health assistance that will be needed for the PTSD that will result from the funeral workers trying to do their work? America needs to realize that the genuine celebrities and VIPs are the people whose names will never be known. They are the ones who will push your stretcher into the hospital, exam your failing body, teach your kids, empty your garbage, wash the bodies of your loved ones, answer the telephone when you call screaming in panic, and bag your groceries.

""Removing statewide mandates does not end personal responsibility.  It's just that now state mandates are no longer needed."" -- Greg Abbott

A week before the official lifting day (10 March), we've already seen the pictures of maskless business operators serving their masked customers.

“Please hear me clearly.  At this level of cases, with variants spreading, we stand to completely lose the hard-earned ground we have gained.” -- Rochelle Walensky, Director of the CDC

Where's our governor's personal responsibility to our nurses in harm's way for going over a year?

Particularly distressing, HEB, one of the largest grocers in Texas cites -- 2,000 ""manager involved"" mask incidents in Houston stores alone -- as the reason to abandon policy on customer masks, now that Abbott has abandoned his statewide mandate.

This virus mutates and existing vaccines are going to be less effective -- meaning ADDITIONAL deaths and debilitations across America.  All because Kool Aid drinkers are mad to have their red-stained lips seen and feckless leaders comply."

None of the deaths were mourned according to Black African American traditions..Nor could our love ones be visited personally in the hospital.

And funeral home staff that are working 24 hours a day, trying to give each person the dignity they deserve.  Then add in the millions of nurses, doctors and other hospital personnel who have cared for those who then died.

2021-03-04 21:31:01,"I found the story sad, shocking and perplexing. Do the people of East Los Angeles have no other funeral homes to which to turn? Is it loyalty to a certain business that leads family members to wait weeks for the funeral home to get to their loved one, stored on shelves? Could not the ownership reach out for help from other funeral homes? Did many of the families have a prepaid plan with this particular business that gave them no choice?

I wonder why we persist in doing this?  .... Certainly other work (such as EMTs and firefighters) is also deeply traumatizing for the front-line workers but it's justifiable because lives are saved.  But these poor folks are put through psychological horrors just so someone can have an open casket, rather than a closed casket, wake."

In April I told my wife I should start digging two plots for in our backyard since it would spare our children the task. I referenced grandpa's burial along side the road in GRAPES OF WRATH and said being bulldozed into a mass grave might be our fate and shrugged. No big deal. April of 2000 was indeed a cruel month.

The news reports on the statistics, but this is much more than that..this is life, this is today and everyday until civilization is vaccinated around the world. All societies, all levels, all socio-economic levels, all neighborhoods near, far and wide.

This is life, real life and the stories need to be compiled and told in a deep way. Every person, every family, every one has a story, we need to stand witness to all of this and we need to grasp it. Hold it in our hands and in our hearts. We need to take care of each other, one another, regardless of where we come from. 

We are, we all are in this together...may we learn to hold grace and may we practice great compassion in tending to one another as we live and do so in regard to those who have died. Life is complicated, but we all need to be there for each other...,pay respect to the living, to the dead and cherish the people who tend to those who have died. When I read the wording the ""Last Responders"", I thought my God,...as I have a brother who is a First Responder...,our God, may they all be respected, cherished and revered for what they do in tending to the patients and to the dead. Heart wrenching.

What was the risk of including them in a mammoth stage 3 trial?  We had a clear and present danger to their lives, and it was far greater than the risk of a vaccine's possible side effects.  If this happens again, WHEN it happens again, our elected officials need to think very differently.  Waiting for a vaccine to be cleared is just absurd for those most likely to die.  The rules have to change.  There needs to be a better assessment of immediate risks vs potential risks."

2021-03-05 01:04:05,"""Inside an Overrun Funeral Home, Where Every Day Is a ‘Nightmare’""

Why would anyone want to experience that?"
2021-03-05 01:43:14,During normal times this has to be a very difficult line of work. I’m thankful for the people who risked there health and that of there families to do this necessary and often thankless job.
2021-03-05 01:44:43,"So many bodies.

So many families left behind.

A funeral home struggling to maintain dignity and solemnity, for itself and for those it helps.

This virus takes and takes and takes, giving only illness and misery and death.


Everybody should read this article, especially those who don't think any of this is real. or care only for themselves."
2021-03-05 04:58:15,"My God, this is an utterly heartbreaking story made even more painful by the photos and the names and condensed stories behind those grim numbers. My heart goes out to the families of all those who have died in this community as well as everyone else who are grieving in every part of this country and the world. May the souls of the thousand who died in this pandemic rest in peace. And God bless these funeral home workers for their vital but difficult, soul-draining work

I've read similar painful, heart-crushing stories like this especially at the peak of the virus' onslaught in New York last year. I hope NY Times will continue to feature stories that show the true, painful impact of COVID-19 especially in states where it's still being denied or downplayed. Thank you and may God bless the reporters and photographer of this story!"
2021-03-05 07:49:46,Devastating and deeply touching at the same time -- my heart goes out to the folks working in the funeral industry who treat the bodies of the dead with such respect and dignity even as they're overburdened and stressed.
2021-03-05 06:52:00,This didn’t have to happen.
2021-03-05 11:52:50,"Another thing most of the public does not understand about funeral homes is that, unlike stores and banks, they do not have an office where you can just walk in during normal business hours, even during normal times. Ring the doorbell and they probably have to stop what they're doing to open the door and politely answer your questions there. They let you in if you have lost someone and need service. It took me a long time to understand this, and also to understand the real reason for grave boxes. The cemetery could easily level off the ground if a grave collapses. The funeral director can't exactly tell the grieving widow(er) that, six months later when they dig the grave next to it, the grave digger would run into an ugly mess."
2021-03-05 13:28:46,It's devastating to read this. The daily lives of the last responders are a nightmare. How do they manage to keep going? And what a sad and tragic ending for so many. My heart goes out to all. My mask stays on.
2021-03-05 16:22:40,"I thank the owners and employees in the funeral industry, an often overlooked and under appreciated essential service. Working in health care for 50 years I’ve made many calls to funeral homes for body retrieval and was always impressed by the professionalism and respect for the deceased and their families they demonstrated ."
2021-03-05 17:14:40,"Thank you - this incredible story brought tears to my eyes.  Every person who refuses to get the vaccine, or who doesn't wear a mask, or refuses to follow the COVID guidelines should read this article.  Thank you to all who are working in the funeral industry. 
Thank you for your devotion to maintaining the dignity of those who have died and assisting the family and loved ones during this tragic time of their lives. 





thank devotion to maintaining the dignity of those who have died and assisting the families who have lost a loved one."
2021-03-05 14:46:33,"All I can think about is how the funeral home workers go in every day knowing what awaits them. Day after day after day, more and more heartache, more and more helplessness, with no end in sight. Their commitment to serving  the deceased and their loved ones is commendable. I am afraid many of us would have cracked long ago."
2021-03-05 15:25:22,"@Matt Covid-19 as a ""badge of honor""?  Speculation as to what percentage are wearing masks and distancing at a supply store for contractors, et al.?  I can't speak to LA but here in the Bay Area, mask wearing and distancing measures are stringently followed in all stores, including the Home Depot.  Then again, mask wearing is taken too far with people driving by themselves in their vehicles.  No, they are not Uber or Lyft drivers.  Or people putting up a mask for three seconds when you pass them on a street from a 20 foot distance.  As if the coronavirus will jump out of someone's skin and fly over to infect you!   As misguided as those who would deny that the virus even exists.  For my own sanity, a cautious but sensible middle ground works best."
2021-03-05 15:31:26,"This article should be essential reading for all Americans. My mother died over two weeks ago in Southern California (San Diego), and there is such a backlog from COVID that she has yet to be cremated. I cry when I think of her aged body alone at the mortuary. But we're lucky: at least she was picked up from the care home. My heart goes out to all my fellow Californians of all beautiful races and ethnicities at this difficult time. You should not have to live and die like this."
2021-03-05 14:14:03,"Trump, Pence, Miller and the failed rulers of the previous regime must be thrilled reading this story. This was their goal all along — to kill as many people of color, immigrants and indigent Americans as possible in the shortest period of time. 

This is the administration that so many GOP members of Congress blindly supported and continue to extol. What a horrid pity."
2021-03-05 22:03:46,"Botched by the dyed blonde playing golf every day in Palm Beach. He knew in February it was a deadly killer but put all his lies and energy into saving the stock market. I know corporations are people, my friends, but I also know they don’t get a deadly virus. 

These workers are heroes for an almost thankless job. I hope this nightmare will be over this year for all of us."
2021-03-05 14:14:44,I wish people who dismiss the risk of this disease could spend 24 hours in an ICU. It is not pleasant to be intubated. Oxygenated air is forced into your lungs. Much easier to wear a mask and observe guidelines recommended by experts like Dr. Fauci.
2021-03-05 14:49:03,"I hope that the governors who remove mask mandates and ""open-up"" 100 % read this heart-breaking article.
On second thought they will not bother to read it because they ""know everything there is to know about everything.""

They should be visiting overwhelmed funeral homes. 
But, of course, they won't. 
Too busy playing politics with the lives of Americans.
Their actions are well beyond shameful.
Criminal.
And should be treated as such."
2021-03-05 18:57:26,"The article puts emotion over facts. How many funerals are there normally and how many are there no extra? Weren't there similar periods in the past years? And how much of this ""overwhelming"" is due to corona safety measures instead of increasing numbers?"
2021-03-04 02:42:34,No one wants to waste energy on commenting about the idiots in Texas and Mississippi. Love the pics here. Good luck. We'll be counting the days.

2021-03-04 02:43:42,"Neanderthals promptly asked for an apology. ... You can't fix stupid, but you can't stop them from culling the herd. ... Wear a mask any way."
2021-03-04 02:43:49,Neanderthal is as Neanderthal does.
2021-03-04 02:48:33,"President Joe Biden is correct....

Neanderthal....primitive, unenlightened, or reactionary; culturally or intellectually backward."
2021-03-04 02:44:44,All I can say is God Bless Texas!!!
2021-03-04 02:45:11,"Neadnerthals were generous, thoughtful, considerate of others and gentlemanly.

Biden is unfair to Neanderthals.

I identify as Neanderthal, and I'm insulted.  There is no excuse for this bigotry."
2021-03-04 02:44:06,"Awful, just awful. How pitiful and terrible—and, yes, enraging—to have a Governor who works against the public good. So many people have died in Texas, and so many tragedies are still unfolding and still to come—there is no justification for Abbott's cavalier indifference to life and death."
2021-03-04 02:51:50,"At least in my neighborhood, the businesses have said they will leave their mask rules in place and it seems like most people wear theirs even when walking outside where it wasn’t required. I totally agree that this is premature, but I am hopeful that we will continue to see masking in most places around me until things improve much more"
2021-03-04 02:48:45,"If the Governors of Texas and Mississippi are so sure that these states have overcome the pandemic, then these two states don't need the vaccines. Their quota of  vaccine and other federal aid should be sent to those states that can better benefit them."
2021-03-04 02:50:25,"Texas' legislators and Governor drinking the ""Cool-Aid"", and have experience making others drinking it as well. It remains to be seen when the Fed's are called in again to help. I am sorry for the great State of Texas."
2021-03-04 02:51:11,"Here’s a suggestion:  let’s get rid of speed limits in school zones.  Speed limits impinge on the personal rights of drivers to go as fast as they want, which impedes their ability to travel quickly.  However, if other people want to slow down in school zones, that’s their personal choice.  We trust people to act responsibly.  And if a child gets hit by a car, well, thoughts and prayers. Personal freedom is just too important."
2021-03-04 02:52:04,"The COVID aid package needs to be amended to condition aid to State and local governments on the applicable jurisdiction maintaining and enforcing a national mask mandate.  The Neanderthals endanger not only residents of their own states (and the medical, grocery, and other essential workers who have to deal with reckless non-mask wearers) but also residents of other states.  By spreading the disease, they enable new mutations to occur and spread, and it is impossible to impose quarantines restricting inter-state travel from reckless states."
2021-03-04 02:53:17,Pray for the safety of our fellow citizens in Texas and prey they have the wisdom to vote Greg Abbott out of office.
2021-03-04 02:53:31,"The only reason TX and MS are allowing no masks is to distract from their failed states which cannot provide basic services to their citizens such as heat and water. The old look over there routine.  Their citizens need to recognize that their real loss of freedom is not from a mask requirement, but rather if they will live or die without basic services. Unfortunately too many have died due to the negligence on these governors' watch."
2021-03-04 02:54:03,Bunch of idiots. Throw backs. Fools. May they reap what they sow. Especially the Governor.
2021-03-04 02:54:25,"I'm glad I do not live in Texas or Mississippi.

Furthermore, I am sure you all realize why these two particular States have removed all the Covid precautions?  It's because their State Governments failed completely during the cold wave, so, they need to change the subject."
2021-03-04 02:54:25,"U.S. needs a national mask mandate.  No state that refuses to comply and enforce it should receive any COVID relief aid.  Amend the package accordingly.  Otherwise, these reckless governors endanger the whole country, and in fact the world, by encouraging the spread and mutation of this dangerous virus."
2021-03-04 02:54:44,"Well done! We are waiting for Gov. DeWine to follow suit. Most folks in Ohio aren’t even wearing their mask correctly. The motivation is not there...most are in a circle of people who either already had the virus or received the vaccine. I had it in November and never got tested. There are millions of people who did the same thing. According to The Columbus Dispatch, there are less than 14K current cases of Covid in our state within the last week. That’s .001% of the entire Ohio population. It’s time."
2021-03-04 02:56:56,"President Biden was just being polite when he called politicians like Texas Governor Greg Abbott for “Neanderthal thinking” for revoking their state mask mandate and reopening all businesses. In fact, it amounts to criminal negligence that will cost lives in a state that has one of the lowest vaccination rates in the nation. Abbott certainly must know better after his experience doing the same thing last spring turned Texas into a Covid charnel house. Now with potentially vaccine resistant Covid variants spreading, his reckless, self-serving policy may kill tens of thousands in Texas and across the nation. This is a national emergency that requires the firm leadership Biden is providing and should prohibit Abbott and others from being allowed to act against the national interest and our public health."
2021-03-04 02:55:23,I disagree. Neanderthal's were a whole lot smarter than the likes of those who disdain wearing masks. Even the dear departed Coco the gorilla was smarter than these guys.
2021-03-04 02:55:48,Neanderthal thinking? That's an unfair swipe at Neanderthals. Neanderthals were quite advanced by comparison. How about Australopithecus thinking or even pre-hominid. Voters should send these fools back to their ancestral caves where they can rediscover stone tools and making fire as they refine their primitive speech above the level of shrieking grunts and groans.
2021-03-04 02:57:36,"""Biden Calls State Decisions to End Mask Mandates ‘Neanderthal Thinking’""

The President is being gracious . . . 

How a Governor--or any elected chief executive--can so willfully place the people whom he is sworn to protect in such risk is unconscionable."
2021-03-04 02:58:17,"Mississippi, Texas: Creationism superseding Science. Again."
2021-03-04 02:59:15,"The more I hear Biden speak, the more I like him.  So glad I voted for him and I am excited about his appointments, his leadership, and his calm demeanor.  He is a class act and there are quite a few Republicans who could take a few lessons from him in humility."
2021-03-04 03:01:09,I think Biden owes an apology to Neanderthals. Comparing them to current science deniers is just unfair.
2021-03-04 02:59:36,"It is laughable that Covid Abbott is accusing Biden of releasing people from immigration detention who have Covid while at the same time as he is lifting the Covid measures.  Obviously if Biden is releasing Covid into the state it's not the time to lift measures. It begs the question: Who  is dumber Traitor Cruz or Covid Abbot?

It is sad that Covid Abbott has so little regard for school teachers, public employees and law enforcement that he did not assure their vaccinations before lifting the restrictions and is placing them and their families at risk.  Rest assured that his family is vaccinated.  Obviously,  there is no common sense anywhere near Abbott.  We may have 'lectricity', but the lights are still out in Texas my friends."
2021-03-04 03:03:22,"Unfortunately for the rest of America, the freeways leading out of Texas don't have locked gates so the COVID surge we expect in Texas is sure to infect the rest of the nation.

It's hard to imagine how something so simple as a mask could morph into something so ridiculous but with Trump & Cruz stoking the flames of ignorance, gullible Texans are sure to succumb. 

How can it be that men from Texas are willing to wear a condom but not a mask? Welcome to Texas."
2021-03-04 03:02:37,What worries me is that these States will set off the Spread of the B.1.1.7. variant.
2021-03-04 03:03:10,There goes Biden speaking ill of Neaderthals.  He should know that they were smarter than some Trump supporters.  At least they knew about fire.
2021-03-04 03:04:18,"There are two ways to get out of a room. Humans, Neanderthals and highly intelligent animals find their way out through the door. Texas and Mississippi governors are species that will try to knock their heads on the wall."
2021-03-04 03:03:33,There will be great satisfaction in telling Abbott we told you so. But satisfaction will be short lived knowing it comes from the health and lives of our fellow citizens.
2021-03-04 03:03:50,Dear gov Abbott: I'm told you have some of the world's finest hospitals and medical schools in the lone star state.   What would they have you do?
2021-03-04 03:04:01,"What is the big deal about wearing a mask?  
 
I bet even Neanderthals, being shown that they could do something to survive, would do it."
2021-03-04 03:05:10,"Reallocate the vaccines for those states for other states. In the end, every states' infection rates are about the same because people travel around. Why should we pay for these states recklessness? Time to speed up vaccination for us."
2021-03-04 03:06:08,What a slap to the face of Neanderthals.
2021-03-04 03:11:37,"People should mask up, full stop."
2021-03-04 03:12:11,"A quick search indicates that a possibly Neanderthal gene structure, present in many humans today, may be related to Covid susceptibility. And publishing this has resulted in some serious outrage. <a href=""https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2818-3"" target=""_blank"">https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2818-3</a> 

I did the search because as soon as I saw the Times headline, I expected it would cause this type of outrage. I was right on the money."
2021-03-04 03:12:05,"President Biden sure uses kind words & phrases. Since many in Texas, Mississippi and beyond will die unnecessarily because of this act of ignorance, it would be acceptable to use harsher language. At least we now have a President with dignity."
2021-03-04 03:10:44,"“Tell it like it is, Joe!”  Biden is a man with real courage."
2021-03-04 03:08:23,"I wish things were different but I’m still going to wear a mask. The Governor of Texas thinks scoring points with Trump is good for him. Wait until there’s another uptick of Covid cases, the Governor will blame Antifa."
2021-03-04 03:11:11,"Perhaps putting the cart before the horse? That is, it’s hard to run a business if you’ve got no water in many homes and businesses."
2021-03-04 03:13:44,Obviously Biden hasn’t been reading the Times. Sheesh.
2021-03-04 03:15:03,Where's the lie?
2021-03-04 03:14:01,Wearing a mask is a simple act that helps to save lives. What is there to think about? Our entire nation remains at risk. The needs of the many take precedence over the desires of a few. Wear a mask. Unknown lives you may help  save thank you.
2021-03-04 03:15:43,"I wish people would stop picking on Neanderthals when they want to demean someone. Gov Abbot and his ilk are not Neanderthals— not even close. 

Neanderthals were family friendly, protective of their tribe and pretty good listeners. They had a very small carbon footprint, were not violent, spoke little, but when they did they stuck to the essentials and the facts. They didn’t start fires except to keep the hearth burning, worshipped their gods respectfully and with reverent awe for all of God and Nature’s gifts. It would be hard to say similar things to the governors of Texas, Mississippi, and Florida. Oh, and also, when making decisions Neanderthals gathered everyone in the clan around a campfire to discuss the matter calmly until they came to consensus."
2021-03-04 03:15:46,This is what telling it like it is looks like. God bless President Biden.
2021-03-04 03:15:52,This kind of stupidity on the heels of the unnecessary power grid disaster cements what most of us think about ( but are too polite to say out loud ) THOSE states like Texas and Mississippi .
2021-03-04 03:16:09,Neanderthals get a bad rap.
2021-03-04 03:17:18,This is an insult to Neanderthals!
2021-03-04 03:17:25,"If the voters you are sucking up to are sick and dead,  they cannot vote for you. 

Abbott made some people stop talking about the catastrophic power grid failure."
2021-03-04 03:17:59,I can't believe how dumb the democrats are with messaging. Clearly Mississippi and Texas the two states which utterly failed with their energy grids and had the bad coldsnap with all of its ramifications are trying to distract from this catastrophe by changing all of the Covid restrictions to nothing.  Biden does not call them out specifically at all which is particularly egregious considering he is also insulting with his Neanderthal comment.  Why not say stop trying to distract from your failures with your energy grid and leave it with that?
2021-03-04 03:18:31,Apparently the indignity of wearing a mask while living is greater than the indignity of dying facedown and alone.
2021-03-04 03:16:41,"Public Health.  This is not a time to discuss our family tree and anthropology!
Public Health and Safety.
Stay on script.

The people in Texas need our prayers. This epidemic is not over."
2021-03-04 03:17:32,"Since Joe said we were in for a 'long, cold winter', Covid deaths and hospitalizations have declined significantly, so he wouldn't appear to have the best fix on where things are with the pandemic."
2021-03-04 03:19:37,Maybe we should re-explore the concept of secession - - this time for just cause .
2021-03-04 03:27:28,"Troglodytes, not Neanderthals."
2021-03-04 03:25:31,"What a gutless decision by the Governor. Shame on ""leaders"" who forgo the right decision for the easy one.  And allowing localities or businesses to require masks while abjuring on the state level is just a gross diffusion of responsibility: push the hard decisions down, down, and away, hiding behind a paper mantel of ""personal responsibility."" The Governor models that even when your job requires such responsibility, and lives depend on it, individuals are too craven, self-serving, or ill-informed to actually flex that muscle. No wonder we have lost faith."
2021-03-04 03:24:52,"Oh, and by the way, we strongly advise against driving drunk, but the government will no longer tell you not to do it."
2021-03-04 03:23:32,"Abbott did the same thing before the previous, huge spike in TX Covid that killed thousands.  He's yelling ""squirrel"" to take the pressure off him from the Deep Freeze power fiasco..."
2021-03-04 03:25:25,We love natural experiments.  This should be very interesting.
2021-03-04 03:25:04,"State aid from the recovery act should be contingent on following CDC guidelines for reopening. 

Easy peasy. And shows economic restraint. 

But must be instant, from day of passage of the law until September. Don’t let Texas cheat by grabbing the money then lifting the restrictions."
2021-03-04 03:28:45,"“The last thing we need is Neanderthal thinking that in the meantime, everything’s fine, take off your mask and forget it,” Mr. Biden told reporters at the White House. “It’s critical, critical, critical, critical that they follow the science.”

I hope I’m not wrong on this, but even with previous holders of the office of POTUS, usually writers will address them them as President, not Mr.  
The Texas Governor did exactly the same thing today as well. 

A small thing, but a little respect for the office and the people that hold it as caretakers of this fine country for their brief time is a good thing."
2021-03-04 03:30:32,Why is it so impossible for Republican governors to ask people to do things for the common good?
2021-03-04 03:32:00,"Most unfair to the Neanderthals.  Take it back, Joe."
2021-03-04 03:32:08,"It’s beyond belief. We’re still not out of the woods and Texas makes a fool’s decision that could potentially set the whole country reeling backwards again. What can one say? Sounds like 500,000 deaths and counting hasn’t made an impression on Governor Abbott. Playing tough guy Republican even after the winter storm debacle apparently isn’t enough self inflicted bad news for this delusional Texas politician. Ted Cruz, John Cornyn and Gregg Abbott are not made in the image of respected Texans like Sam Houston or LBJ that made Texas the great American state that it is today. Rather they’re lackeys of a perverse Republican party willing to ignore what’s best for their people’s well being and America’s best interests. Pathetic."
2021-03-04 03:29:53,"Neanderthal and Caveman meanings:

Neanderthal is (pejorative) a primitive person or a person with old-fashioned ideas or who opposes change while caveman is an early human or closely related species, popularly held to reside in caves.

No matter which is in charge, Texas is in for big trouble.  Neither is a match for Covid19."
2021-03-04 03:32:17,"A couple of points. 

First, Biden obviously disagrees with the decision of the Texas governor to drop the statewide mask mandate, but ultimately what can he do about it?  Absolutely nothing.  The federal government doesn't have the power to shut down businesses, quarantine people and enforce social distancing and mask wearing.  Biden can't tell the states what to do in those regards, and neither could Trump.  Yet Trump was criticized in these pages for doing nothing.  Now we hold our breaths waiting for the NY Times to criticize Biden.  I suspect we will be waiting a long time.

Second, virtually every scare prediction the NY Times has made over the past year in the pandemic coverage has turned out wrong.  Among them, Florida nursing homes were going to get decimated, just like NY.  Wrong, Florida had a Governor who worked hard to protect nursing homes, unlike NY's Governor who killed thousands of people with his decisions.  West Virginia was going to get ravaged by COVID because it's so poor and backwards.  Wrong.  West Virginia actually did better than most states.  NY was the only state that had the pandemic ""under control"" over the summer.  Wrong NY never had it under control.  It's under control when no one is getting infected, and that was never the case in NY.  The Super Bowl in Tamps was a super spreader event that was going to cause COVID cases to skyrocket in Florida.  Wrong.  Cases in Florida have been trending downwards per capita far faster than cases in NY."
2021-03-04 03:36:15,"Biden should call that Bolsonaro thinking. The entire country of Brazil has its hospitals in crisis. Everyday breaks the previous day record of deaths and hospitalized people - vaccine and all.

Go ahead Texas and Mississippi, be like Brazil. Sign your own death sentence."
2021-03-04 03:39:14,"The science that launches rockets from Houston says wear masks and stop  whining, governor."
2021-03-04 03:39:19,Thank you President Biden for calling these Republicans Governors of the Deep South what they richly deserved to be called.  It should outrage any logical and thinking person  that  their ignorance endangers us all.   They are truly knuckle walkers.
2021-03-04 03:35:09,"The Neanderthal anti defamation league, protest your comparing them to Texans and Mississippians. We are much more refined and intelligent."
2021-03-04 03:35:04,Just when we are close to beating Covid the knuckle dragging Republicans come in and obstruct the plan to save the planet. Why?  Only they know the answer to that question.
2021-03-04 03:39:24,Neanderthals were almost certainly morally and intellectually far ahead of the average Texan governor.  Not an appropriate comparison.
2021-03-04 03:38:49,The United States is in the midst of a national vaccination program that could potentially prevent a fourth wave of COVID-19. And what do the Governors of Texas and Mississippi do—sign executive orders issuing the relaxation of COVID-19 preventive measures specifically repealing universal mask mandates. President Biden’s remarks about inept leadership coming from those two governors were correct.
2021-03-04 03:42:06,"""Neanderthal thinking?"" For a president who likes to talk about uniting the country, comparing the brain power of people who don't agree with you to a different species sure is a bold strategy. I'm all for masking, but this is another example of people on the left acting like people who don't agree with them don't just have bad ideas, they are either too stupid to realize how wrong they are or they are irredeemably bad people. I voted for Biden because I thought he would move away from the divisive rhetoric of the Trump era. If he wants my vote again, comments like these certainly won't help."

Way to go, Texas."
2021-03-04 03:45:30,Gov. Abbott picked a good way to divert attention from the disastrous decisions on his watch regarding the Texas power grid.
2021-03-04 03:47:03,So embarrassed on behalf of my state. I wonder how many of us will be less likely to go out because of the reduced masking? I certainly will be staying home as much as possible until we get enough vaccinations in enough arms.
2021-03-04 03:49:14,Biden is gentle when he calls these extremist politicians as Neanderthals.
2021-03-04 03:49:15,"""Neanderthal"" is too kind by half. It's moronic and deadly. 

Every paper today has featured the devastation happening in Brazil even as we write. We know that Texas has the dubious distinction of hosting all five variants right now. 

It is insane that at the very moment variants are exploding these governors elect to do the very things most calculated to give the virus a literal stranglehold. We're only in the ""end stretch"" if we have the stamina and staying power to finish, and that means upping our vigilance, doubling our masks, continuing to socially distance until more are vaccinated.

I truly feel for the citizens of these states who know unmasking is wrong but who will now be put in danger by a  governor who doesn't care. What about their right to safety? To life?  Between this and the storm debacle, Abbott as been directly responsible for the deaths of citizens. There is no excusing this.

Abbott needs to be impeached."

2021-03-04 03:52:47,I moved to Texas over 20 years ago and the governor's half-hearted efforts to deal with covid have made me want to leave the state. I will continue to wear a mask and continue other precautions advocated by the CDC. Most people I know are doing the same.

I don't remember the Republican mindset to be this uncomplicated and boorish. Greg Abbott is a lunatic like Trump.
This kind of crude mindset which seems to be oozing from every Republican mind in power, got much worse since Trump was voted out of office. Republicans running berserk is the norm these days. This country will become great again as soon as the power is taken away from these fools."
2021-03-04 03:52:02,"There is little reason to insult Neanderthals. The thinking exercised by Abbot and other phonies pretending that their libertarian hooey is conservative is repellent. Conservative means cautious, not foolish."
2021-03-04 03:52:03,"Abbott clearly learned nothing from the crisis of just a couple weeks ago: rather than being cautious and preparing for the worst, he’s acting as if nothing bad could happen. Republicans: how is that they are only conservative when it comes to how much they’ll spend on helping the poor? Whether it be planning for the Iraq war or dealing with a pandemic, their special brand of lazy, foolhardy optimism (of sorts) costs us all a great deal of blood and treasure."

I've got a college buddy who lives in Austin and since he moved there 5 years ago, the main aim of the state government there is to subsidize oil companies and pass laws explicitly made to harass citizens of their largest cities. Why move to a state that sells out its power grid to private speculators and doesn't even protect its own citizens?"

What about a plan to upgrade the quality of masks for those who have to endure the ""freedom"" to risk the life of others?  One year went by and the supply and price of quality masks that have been instrumental in protecting health professionals remain scarce and expensive for the general population."
2021-03-04 03:59:34,"We just got rid of a president who made such comments. This is why after that first debate with Mr. Trump, Mr. Biden lost my support and why I did a write in ballot for Kamala as President and Biden as Vice President. The main role of a president is to unit a country of 50 states under a federal system, calling out one state's poor decision is one thing, but to call them Neanderthals is just insulting and divisive and he should apologize to Texas."

There is no reason for such rude comments about these surely wonderful cousins of our’s.

On the other hand, the world the Neanderthals lived in and their society is probably something the Texans can aspire to: ultimate freedoms, no rules and structure such as roads, hospitals, public schools and other restrictive and financially draining concepts - just yourself, every man for himself!

Any questions?"
2021-03-04 04:02:42,"Speaking for the Neanderthals, I object.

From my Anthropology days, the first thing I learned about Neaderthals is their bones were found with clumps of pollen, suggesting respect for their dead with burials and flowers.This would have been circa 70,000 years ago and a very early sign of cognizance of life/death. I have been fond of their gentleness  from the day I learned that. 

While the burial/pollen hypothesis has been long in dispute, a more recent excavation found skeletal and pollen remains in soil suggesting purposeful digging. 

The Neaderthals were less inventive than humans, with whom they coexisted and interbred with. While we carry Neaderthal genes, as a separate subspecies, they did go extinct. Did we, with our quickly evolving tool making skills kill them off?

I like to think the gentler side of humans were inherited from Neanderthals. And I often wish Homo sapiens neanderthalis had survived instead of us; the earth would still be pristine. I can't think of a more destructive species for our mother earth than Homo sapiens sapies."

Compare the new coronavirus infection rates (per 1000 people, to equalize for population size) in Texas versus other states that don't open up and remove restrictions. In about three weeks we should start seeing the numbers... and we'll know with some pretty strong evidence whether the face masks, social distancing, and all the rest make any difference. Not that it will matter there - after all, it's TEXAS, the state that elected Ted Cruz... twice. But still, the numbers, the data, that kind of stuff matters for some people. This ""liberal coastal elite"" will keep wearing my mask, thank you, even though I got both shots a few weeks ago. Good luck, Texas.

I think it's a fair question as to when exactly state and federal governments lose the right to ""suspend"" the very first amendment to our constitution (to the extent it ever had the right to in the first place, which is not as clear as everyone seems to assume it is).  

The way it is supposed to work, in case we've forgotten, is we are free to do pretty much whatever we want in this broad and ever free land, and the government is to stay out of our affairs (and our property).  You might even say that's what this country was founded upon, and, if you said that, you'd be correct.

Obviously we have plenty of people on these pages who are afraid of their own shadows; others would prefer to dive in first, then ask how deep the water is.  Neither extreme is an objectively better way to live although I obviously prefer something closer to the latter if I had to choose a side to err on.  We're all going six feet under eventually - might as well enjoy it while we can.

The problem is that the risk averse among us have, in addition to their pathological fear of life, an abiding conviction that this pathology is in fact a virtue and that everyone should either be like them or be forced to behave as if they were by a government that unlawfully seizes power by the second."

The covid fatality rate for healthy individuals under 65 is a fraction of a percent. The prevalence of serious, long-term covid is also low. In a few months most of the rest of us will have been vaccinated too. It's time to start thinking about how we move on from this, not wallow in continuous misery, pessimism and negative thinking because we've grown so accustomed to it that we forgot how to find our way out."
2021-03-04 04:05:48,"Face masking is the best way to slow the spread while being able to function normally in society. It's frustrating that people are increasingly inhabiting two stupid absolutist camps - one that wants to act like that COVID doesn't exists, and the other that wants everything shut down indefinitely. People value their own political signaling over common sense.

For goodness sake, life is not black and white. Go about your business and wear a mask indoors. It shouldn't be hard for a competent government to communicate that."

For the last year, all of our lives have been turned upside down, and now we are at a crossroads where we, as a country, have a good chance of finally getting the virus under control so we can all go back to some normalcy.  And then this?  What a selfish decision to make, especially since this decision affects all 50 states.  I do wish other states could sue TX and MS for these actions.

The variants are already spreading to more people from each one infected and the degree of illness at it’s worse is worse, too. The more it spreads the more mutations and opportunities to become more lethal. So opening up and abandoning masks defies risks of far worse and far more infected people. It’s risking a lot of lives and extending the economic stagnation."
2021-03-04 05:01:21,Ironic that The Times today has an article  about reconstructing the ear bones of a Neanderthal to determine whether it could hear. Apparently there are some human beings who cannot hear or do not listen to the warnings of the dangers of  discontinuing wearing masks.

Having the decency to wear a mask in stores to protect essential workers who keep shelves stocked is asking too much, provoking paroxysms of whining about their rights.  Talk about snowflakes.   JFK once said ask not what your country can do for you, but what you can do for your country.  Here’s a simple opportunity to help out and be a patriot.  Make a small sacrifice and wear a mask.

Everyone needs to realize that masks can reduce the spread, even now.  And it's not just to save the wearer, but those around us as well."
2021-03-04 07:15:03,The science of the efficacy for wearing masks in limiting transmission is clear. The pity is the early US public pronouncements -including from Fauci and the CDC muddied the waters needlessly on this. Good quality well fitting masks are essential in confined spaces.

This is what freedom looks like. Freedom to make your own decisions."
2021-03-04 08:14:24,"Meanwhile, in the real world of actual data, new cases are rising in states exposed to the virus variants. We are losing the race because its a nuanced race, and apparently many Americans don't do nuance.

We needed to use vaccinations ,shots in arms, to drive new cases to say less than 5000 per day nationwide.
Why? Because each person carrying live virus, is a variant generating factory. The virus stays alive in human hosts. The more human hosts, the more viral entities, the more entities the more variants. Variants may be more contagious and more deadly.
We did not reduce new cases far enough. They are rising in places like Texas, NJ, NY  and even Ct. We are on the threshold of another wave. This may be worse than previous ones because the mitigation techniques won't work as well and the virus will kill more people.
 The Biden administration's heroic efforts to increase the rate of vaccinations have been a bright spot. By dropping mask requirements, we encourage further erosion of other mitigations.
We also demonstrate a complete lack of the crucial ability to learn from our past mistakes. Shame on us."

My best friend still can hardly breathe after getting it, and she was not quite careful enough, sadly. Masks are important. Sadly, masks have to be mandated, but clearly, many people are selfish and cannot be bothered to think of others outside their own homes. I am not that person. I wear a double-layer mask in public, period; and I would regardless of the mandate. I was born with asthma, and Covid would probably kill me or come very close to it. Neanderthal is an unfair word, though."

Let's be educated and look at the statistics before we allow - them - the winners of these scare tactics - to destroy our lives. I am 74 and have mesothelioma and like at least 85% of the corona cases, I had hardly any symptoms and no damages. You never hear about us though! Wonder why?"

It is sad to watch as some of the people in power in this country risk the lives of their constituents in order to make themselves look better.  Governor Abbot needs to get people to think about something other than the failure of the power grid in his state.  People in Texas are angry and rightly so given what happened.  That he thinks that risking a rise in the number of Covid-19 cases and a rise in the death toll is a good way to appease the people of his state is, to my way of thinking, appalling bad judgement."

What’s the difference? Many, but mainly this - in Taiwan there is a learned focus on “the collective “ - we are part of a larger group, it is not about me, it’s about us.  In America the popular focus is the opposite- on “me” and some sort of rogue interpretation of freedom as the right to pursue a rugged individualism even at the cost of other people.  These are stark differences in values, translated through policy.
The reveal on the difference in the number of deaths should give us pause. The dead deserve at least that consideration."

1.   NY did not shut the theatre district, instead using shows to educate people on how to protect themselves from the virus.

2.   Not a single business was shut down in NY City.

3.   Not a single school was closed because it was felt schools offered a cleaner, safer environment than crowded tenements.

Compare the above three items to the CV19 response in NY City.

1.  The Theatre district is closed and almost all business in that area has ""Out of Business"" sign up on the door of the place.

2.  NY City's businesses have been gutted and about 80% have gone out of business.

3.  NY Schools were shut down and kids were/are at home with little supervision in most cases.

So, calling Abbott a Neanderthal for recognizing that if we don't open back up it will be a calamity for the State Treasuries all over the USA?

Seems unfair and pointless.

A Trumpian bootlicker, Abbott is guilty of egregious voter suppression efforts, climate change denial, blaming Democrats for the deadly power failures in Texas that took place during the recent arctic blast, and now common sense public health matters. Eschewing CDC safety guidelines like the wearing of a mask and social distancing while the Covid19 pandemic still raging, mutating, and causing an average of 2000 American deaths per day, is just nuts! Hopefully Texans with common sense will ignore their governor's deadly advice and listen to the health experts. Everybody is tired of the pandemic. But proclaiming its premature end will only enable a deadlier variant to take hold. 516,000 Americans have died. Proclaiming the wearing of face masks tyranny is ignorant, disrespectful, and counter-productive. And it's a particular insult to every American who has lost a family member who fought the viral outbreak on the front lines of the pandemic.

Their mask protects me from them. Their choices affect whether or not it is even safe for me to enter the grocery store. It is not just about them and their families. It is about all of us. 

The secondary reasoning that rates are dropping for no mask need... well the icy roads both states had kept people off the roads and at home. That kind of social distancing will cause rates to drop.  Of course that has been over for a while (except I still have no water!!!), and so rates will be on their way back up s actions and outcomes are lagged. The weather and impact on enforced social distancing (eg staying at home due to the roads) should have been seen by those governors that social distancing works! Sheesh we need to teach more practical application science in K-12!!! (Well and keep politics out of science).

And then some of us have the suspicion that there is a political side of this - knowingly making a decision that will case rates to rise and thus try to undermine President Biden's success in dealing with the virus.

The prevalence of mask wearing is clearly higher today than when the pandemic started over a year ago.  If that is the case then why is COVID continuing to spread, what is causing the spread, why are some states with strict mask mandates doing better than those with strict mandates?  These all seem reasonable questions to me and honestly I don't think there have been a lot of answers other than ""wear a mask.""  Logically it makes sense and I gladly comply but instead of this being a black or white proposition perhaps the science should answer these plausible questions.

My other main complaint about the pandemic is the media rarely publishes any positive news about the pandemic.  My sense is most articles are mostly doom and gloom.  We have vaccines but the variants are causing alarm, cases are going down but they will go up again and so on.  I even read an article in the NYT last week about a doctor who said he was not sure he was ready to eat a peach again which is alarmist thinking even during a pandemic.

2021-03-04 17:01:57,"So in Texas and Mississippi and other red regions we have the ""courageous freedom fighters"" rising up against the bossy state or perhaps just  a mindless mob about to essentially ""lynch"" itself in an intoxicated fear and rage.  A mob of 73 million exhilarated with  a kind of dance of death, at least for their grandparents, family members with underlying health conditions.  What could go wrong. It's not DT, he's just their cheerleader."

Ironically, it is Biden's categorical us/them thinking is the primitive cognitive state.  But that may be too meta for a septugenarian.  Le sigh."
2021-03-04 18:01:51,"Mississippi Gov. Tate Reeves never had a statewide mask mandate. He issued mandates by county, apparently unaware that Mississippians cross country lines all the time. Therefore, as of today, March 4, his county mandates has lead to 296,154 Covid-19 cases in the state and 6,764 deaths. Figures are from the Mississippi department of health. The state's population (2019 figures) is 2.976 million."
2021-03-04 17:39:41,"Comparing Abbott's decision to suspend all restrictions in Texas as 'Neanderthal thinking' may be an insult to Neanderthals. When the pandemic in  Texas spikes, which it will, then the federal government should not bail Texas out of its self induced healthcare and economic mess. When they have to go back into lockdown, Texans must likely blame Abbott and Republicans not Biden or Democrats. Sadly their missteps impact the rest of us who don't live in Texas and never want to live in Texas."

2021-03-04 20:43:39,"Does “personal responsibility “ that governor Abbott mentioned mean that an individual not wearing a mask is responsible if they infect another person with the virus? Also, the timing of the opening is suspect. The Texas republicans in power in every statewide office, commission and department are looking to blame our recent power disaster on anyone but themselves. No responsibility on their part so let’s change the subject for a few news cycles and everyone will forget."
2021-03-04 20:36:46,"Mr. Abbott appeared live on NBC Channel 2 news here in Houston 3Mar at 5:00.  The anchor's opening question was about President Biden's description of the decision to drop the mask mandate and reopen 100% as ""Neanderthal"".   Mr. Abbott paused briefly, then launched into what I can only describe as a long, fast talking rant.  He accused the President of importing Covid into Texas towns via immigrants, brought up Mr. Cuomo's Covid fiasco in nursing homes, etc.  He would not stop this diatribe even when the anchor tried to interrupt.  Truly a Trumpesque tactic of dominating any discussion by talking over everybody.  Clearly, Mr. Abbott is feeling the condemnation from parties across the board, many who see an attempt to change the subject from the deadly winter storm fiasco being blamed on a decade or two of GOP state rule."

2021-03-04 20:56:41,"Aside from the fact that there is now a growing scientific consensus that Neanderthals were more intelligent than we Homo Sapiens (SAPS for short), this name-calling reminds me of a wonderful moment in the Robert Mitchum film of Farewell My Lovely.
Dazed and weakened after being held prisoner in a brothel, detective Phillip Marlowe grabs a gun from one of his captors then barges in on the madame holding him, demanding answers. She laughs at him! He says, ""Look, this is a gun. When you point a gun at people they're supposed to do what you tell them."" And the madame laughs again, saying that doesn't happen when the person holding the gun is too weak to do anything.
That is the position it took Biden not even two months to find himself in, essentially saying ""Look, this is the presidency speaking. When you're president people are supposed to do what you say."" But as president Biden clearly has no juice and so he reduces himself - and the presidency - with childish name-calling that reveals him to be weak.
I knew it was coming, but this fast? Nope.

The Governor of Texas is not a scientist, a business major and law degree, not science. So, Ms. Urenda-Culpepper, his decisions are political, not in line with our nation's CDC or the science.

Now the trumpy, Republican-led Texas legislature is looking at legislation/distractions to allow us to vote to secede and Abbott lifts the mask mandate, conveniently forgetting how we feel behind in vaccination due to his inability to keep the lights on and the roads cleared.  

It's beginning to dawn on people that with Russia hacking into America's utility systems, Texas looks like a sitting duck.  Imagine the power going out for weeks during August when temperatures are sky high.  Home values will plummet, and our high property taxes won't budge.  Send Republicans and their corruption, incompetence, and ridiculous culture wars home.  There are citizens out there who actually give a Texas-sized cow patty when it comes to public service.

He, because of his “work” on Covid-19, the electrical grid and other stellar examples of failure, appears to not be even a primate.

So, Mr. President, call Abbott's thinking/actions self-serving, short-sighted, and reckless, but please, NOT Neanderthal."

Everybody talks about science but media does not give a chance for scientists and medical professionals with alternative view. There is no reasonable discussion and (or) backups with hard numbers supporting mask mandate. This also looks like dictatorship you just do what you are told to do no questioning no reasoning. If this blind obedience continues this way then this restrictions will remain far longer after vaccination maybe every flue season we might have new variants and forever. We just need to admit that COVID will stay with us and this is another type of respiratory disease. No need to worry and people can be cured with this disease. People who are fearful about the virus let's them wear mask and take vaccine. Give people a choice to do what suits them the best and they can get personalized recommendations from their doctors.

While I know that living in dorms is a different experience than having to do college online, I have a lot of empathy for the students who have to deal with this.

My college is doing jack-all to support us during covid, and I haven't left my house since March 13, 2020. This means I haven't seen anyone outside my immediate family in almost a year. There could be parallels drawn to these dorm kids."
2021-03-04 14:30:16,"I truly admire what Dr. Anarumo did. As a parent, helping your kids manage through this intense isolation has been draining....but it is worse for the kids. And there are going to be long term effects...no doubt. I truly love Dr. Anarumo's leadership style. Well done, sir!"

2021-03-04 15:52:29,"I am a student attending university in person this semester. I graduated high school online (without a stage, only a slide show on YouTube), and I started college this fall with moderately high hopes. 

Near the middle of October, one of my roommates came in contact with someone who had tested positive for covid, and my school’s quarantine rules meant that all of my roommates had to quarantine in our room for 14 days as a result. It was brutal. It is emotionally draining to have everything you are looking forward to for the next 2 weeks taken away because you happen to live with someone who has an advisor unlucky enough to test positive for covid (once he tested negative two times, he was free to leave isolation. We had to wait out the whole two weeks regardless of testing). 

I ended up falling behind in a lot of classes because of the toll on mental health. I may be an introvert, but I still enjoy sunlight and walks and being in a larger space than a dorm room. There is an expectation to get ahead in classes because of all of this new free time, but all any of us could really do is try to take care of ourselves. 

Some of my friends encountered a similar situation: a 5 day quarantine because an individual in their circle was symptomatic. They told me their days in quarantine were some of their worst days for mental health during the whole semester. 

We all understand that these quarantines are for the sake of public health, but they do disregard student mental health."
2021-03-04 16:02:18,"I was moved enough by the colonel's leadership-by example and empathy for these students to tear up; I was also made to reflect by the comments of Nate from Stockholm. I don't see attending to the mental health of isolated people of any age as mollycoddling, but I DO agree with his point that the mental health of young nonstudent essential workers should receive some attention--not very likely to happen, though, given the abysmal state of mental-health ""coverage"" options in the U.S. Like the rest of the First World countries, we need to make health care a right rather than a privilege only some can pay for."

2021-03-04 17:24:47,"Wait so the timeline here implies they were quarantined for about 2 weeks, then resumed normalcy for another week, and then back to a slightly less strict quarantine for 2-3 weeks, while continuing with online instruction. Seems to me that if someone died during the first quarantine, then they had mental health issues beforehand. They can't seek help of course, because it's a military academy preparing you for the military, and if you have a diagnosed mental illness like depression, you can't join the military, making your years at the academy all for naught. The steps taken in this article towards helping the feelings of social isolation are great, but it seems to me that there's a desperate need for more mental health care at the academy."
2021-03-04 17:29:12,"I’m not sure I understand the need for complete quarantine in the room. I can understand the need to control the virus, but it seems to me that a rotating schedule of some sort could be devised so that people could at least get outside. Pods of 2-4 people could also be created, or even a dorm floor. Yes, they would have exposure to each other, but it would be exposure to the same people and, in that sense, no different than a family unit. If they’re not going off campus and they’re staying in their same group, they could even eat together. 

So, have mandatory testing before they come to the school. Then, require them to stay with their assigned group for 2 weeks after they get to school. If anyone in that group shows symptoms, then re-test and decide what type of quarantine is necessary for that group. The trick to keep the virus out after that two week period would be keeping the kids on campus except for trips to town that are properly socially distanced and masked. No eating out or going to bars or clubs. That does mean there needs to be things for them to do on campus."

General MacMorland looked the part and set a good example as did the academic, Clarence Moll. The point is that good leaders in the military, in academia, business and non profits do not sit behind desks. They are out and about with the privates and professors and administrators and sales people and nurses helping to understand their needs.

2021-03-04 23:31:59,"I remember talking casually at a summer garden party to a high school graduate who was about to go off to college.  I asked him if he knew who his roommate would be.  He replied that he had a single, “because I’m pre-med, you know.”. I was at loss to reply, because I remembered from my college experience how beneficial it had been to have a roommate my freshman year."

2021-03-05 00:16:42,"HUA, Colonel."
2021-03-05 00:38:38,Thank you for showing these young people what a leader looks like Dr Anarumo.
2021-03-05 00:39:32,"Its like prison?  Worse, its what prisoners call 'solitary' when punished for acting out.  That sounds inhumane!"
2021-03-05 00:53:28,"Wonderful leadership and understanding of the danger that isolation poses to mental health.

My son will be attending Norwich this fall ... He lost a friend who was a freshman at Texas A&M to suicide tis January, and two other cadets at to he school had taken their lives last fall.  So hideously tragic!

I'm so impressed and thrilled that Norwich has such a wise President."
2021-03-05 01:29:07,"Might this isolation and quarantine at college students' age and level of experience be considered a form of training not only for the military but also for going into civil service carriers (think, foreign service assignments).

As a Peace Corps Volunteer in a rural community where most local residents neither spoke English nor the language I was taught as a PCV trainee there were many days if not a few weeks of severe isolation.  Yes, I survived those periods with renewed ideas about self and the world.

2021-03-05 02:04:34,"As a Norwich graduate, retired Army officer, and a college professor for over 40 years, I read the whole article with admiration for President Anarumo and the cadets who were mentioned.  The academics, military education, and the faculty and staff of Norwich have always been first rate, not only in their subject knowledge but in their support and compassion for the students.  One forgets that these 2,000 men and women are just 18-21 years of age, and seeking role models."
