2020-04-06 17:51:43,"Perhaps the violence stems from people being trapped inside their homes with only their TVs, forced to watch The Child President Donald Trump lying to them throughout the day.  They become enraged at him, yet can only take out their aggression on people within their reach."
2020-04-06 17:36:06,This and school absenteeism go hand in hand. Abusers won't let their kids engage in remote learning because it intrudes on the space that they control.

2020-04-06 17:53:06,"People need to be able to flee violent partners. If it's between getting beat to death or risking heading to a safe house then leave. Take the risk and leave. Perhaps as a side affect many will ultimately choose to leave the abuser and get their own life in order. Either during this pandemic or shortly after.

Can't imagine the horror some must survive. As if there's not enough misery in the world angry abusive sick people now have complete access to their victims."
2020-04-06 17:44:23,"This is frightening, but my mind always goes to the children who are stuck in abusive homes with abusive domestic partner. These poor souls have nowhere to turn too. Are our governments doing anything for them, is there hotline line they can call into? Would they be able to get out the household and where would they go?"
2020-04-06 17:44:55,"Now more than ever, governments and police need to believe women and act aggressively when reports of intimate terrorism occur. The men committing abuse should be the ones being kicked out of home and isolated pending trial, not their spouses."
2020-04-06 17:39:04,"People at risk of domestic violence should be able to move into some of the ample supply of empty hotel rooms. I don't want to hear about cost, not after we just appropriated 2 tril$ to help clean up Trump's mess."
2020-04-06 18:31:27,"I have worried about this since shelter in place orders arrived. For so many, shelter is a misnomer. There is no safety in being asked to stay indoors. Violent people will only be more violent, and their victims, spouses, partners, children, will have less recourse, less opportunity for escaping, even if just for a few hours. I worry, I worry."
2020-04-06 18:31:58,"Domestic abuse is a global public mental health failure, and a symptom of a cultural failure, that deserves far more attention and resources, at the root cause level. 

Its obviously tied to cultural and social attitudes, attitudes that can be changed. Some countries have much higher incidences, as do some states. Deep red states in the US have higher rates. Northwest Africa, Middle East, have higher rates. Prevalence correlates to religion as well. Other countries, with different norms and education systems have much lower rates. We should call a spade a spade, this is culture. Its not just human nature.

This article is useful but overly simplistic. Men are also often the subject of abuse and violence in the home from women, yes, at a far lower rate, though you'd never know it from reading the piece.  In any case all people should be secure in their homes against violence, and women are more at risk across the board.

Quick solutions are hard to come by, because this is so chronic. But for immediate term, perhaps distributing info through media that punishments for domestic abuse are tripled during quarantine, like those ""fines doubled in school zone"", and more investment in public service announcements. Maybe it brings larger lasting attention to the issue. I hope it does. We're better than this."
2020-04-06 18:46:56,"I think its important to note that the shelter in place instructions - and the problems those instructions create - are the political response to the pandemic - they are not caused by the pandemic itself.  It is something that needs to be put in the balance of whether the shelter in place orders are appropriate - all things considered (job loss, domestic violence, massive debt, etc.)"
2020-04-06 18:49:07,"It is simply not true that men are just as likely as women to be victims of serious domestic abuse. The Canadian government did a widespread study on this a while back, and the numbers are not believed to have changed significantly in the last decade. Women are almost four times more likely than men to be victims of spousal violence. And the violence is more likely to be fatal or cause serious injury. There is no reason to think these numbers are drastically different in the US and you can likely find the stats. 

Short of a woman having a gun in her hands, that she knows how to use, the man always holds a big advantage in any physical fight due to the massive discrepancy in body strength. Women are much more likely to live in life-or-death fear of their husbands than vice versa. 

Most men know this and do not deny it. I am a woman, and I believe most men are our allies and are inclined to protect us. Those of you who want to deny that men are disproportionately dangerous to women are either living under a rock or harbor anti-woman sentiments."

2020-04-06 18:04:05,"President Trump alluded to this issue during one of his briefings. Living in a constant state of lockdown with no end in sight brings a variety of social, health and economic issues. You name it - domestic violence, drug addiction, despair and depression. Add the economic collapse that follows, and you have an explosive situation at home. I understand the social distancing and lockdowns are critical to contain the virus, but we need to have an exit strategy."

And here’s an idea:  Amazon and other major companies and shippers should emblazon that info on its boxes, bags, and envelops.  

Maybe even host printed magnetic or peal on/off PSAs (public service announcements or Ad Council campaigns) on their vehicles.  Especially during state or national emergencies such as this one.

Maybe in another two weeks you'll notice that single moms are being told by some supermarkets that they can't even bring their kids in to shop with them, though it's also illegal for them to leave their kids alone, so they should all just starve."
2020-04-06 18:46:28,"Victims need to have as many avenues of escape as possible. Can we set up motels where they can go and not be found on a temporary basis as part of Covid19 response? As one who has experienced domestic abuse, I know how important a reprieve from advise is just for survival. I used to spend my hours outside of the office in the gym, at the park, in my car just to get away from my abuser. It was the only way to stay sane. Maybe a positive, unintended consequence will be more women leaving these relationships. My heart goes out to you all. Stay strong, even if only to yourself."

2020-04-06 18:47:39,"Domestic violence is one of those national crises that have been a pox on us for years and years and suddenly is making some national headlines because of the pandemic crisis which, like a vicious hurricane, is churning up the recognition of a lot of matters that this country just can't get a serious grip on – or the grip happens in that typical two-steps-up-1.5-steps-back that a lot of people pipe-dream as making progress.

[There were recent reports today that black communities in Chicago are taking seriously disproportional fatal hits of C-19]. My point is the public awareness and recognition of those ills and the other ones will slide to the back-burners as this pandemic resides."

2020-04-06 18:26:46,"If my husband went up to a women on the street, beat, chocked kicked or slapped —it wouldn't be defined as ""domestic abuse"".  Yet, when a man or women is evolved in an intimate relationship, violence defined differently and prosecuted differently, this is the problem."

This is the worst possible scenario for countless females. An absolute living nightmare."
2020-04-06 18:41:50,This is an (unavoidable?) cost of social distancing.
2020-04-06 18:17:50,"The amazing book, ""No Visible Bruises"" by Rachel Snyder  came out last year, illuminates this horrific problem allowing those not privy to domestic violence to understand how horrible it is. It is always men abusing women and children, sometimes killing them, sometimes killing themselves as well. The remedies are piecemeal since there have been no broad, expansive studies on the topic and few direct attempts to address the issue. It is, after all, the ""woman's fault"" (in every situation what the abusers say) and therefore it does not warrant any attention. Typically it's difficult to rescue women working in menial jobs, or not working at all, and who in some cases do not have access to a car. They are as trapped as possible and even if they can escape, it is typically just for a short period as, really, where can they go? And, frequently, their tormentors just go find them and terrorize them into coming back, with promises that things will change. They don't.

Perhaps the virus will bring this issue to the fore so MONEY can be put into research and resources but don't count on it. We live in a country where the POTUS thinks it's fine to insult women publicly (a mild form of abuse), and with a government that has refused (repeatedly) to pass the Equal Rights Amendment. Think about that. 

If God is a man (and in all mainstream religions, that's so) then women are born ""lesser"". Weak men need women to be weaker to build them up. Just look to DJT if you need an example of that."

2020-04-06 18:20:48,"In my hometown of Mount Vernon, NY,  it was reported by the Mayor that a husband killed his 12 year old daughter, his wife, then himself. This virus will take a tremendous toll on individuals with underlying mental issues. I don't know if this person had any, but I think this pandemic will negatively impact those who have difficulty adjusting to this new normal. We need to go deep in our souls and find ways to coup until this is over. Praying for the family."
2020-04-06 18:36:26,"I hate to say I told you so, but...

It was pretty obvious from the first mention of a lockdown order that this would happen. People stuck at home will be angry, they will be in confined spaces for long periods of time living on top of other people (because most of us don’t have spacious Beverly Hills mansions), they will be more likely to drink because of stress and boredom. Ideal conditions for already-abusive relationships to worsen and new abuse to begin as people’s mental states deteriorate.

And yet: not a peep from anyone about this obvious emergency on the horizon. This is maybe the second article I’ve seen. I think I heard a politician mention it but that’s probably wishful thinking.

Between this— because domestic violence disproportionately does affect women— and the jettisoning of abortion as a nonessential surgery in some states, we can’t let this virus destroy decades’ worth of progress in women’s rights. Whether in war or in situations like this, it seems like women bear the brunt of the hardship."

2020-04-06 19:20:10,"So weird to see this article today because my two nieces called this weekend and they both talked about being cooped up in the house with their perspective spouses, and feeling trapped.  While they did not fear for their lives, both felt pressure and strong sense of being uncomfortable.

I think my husband and I must be either from another solar system or just plain weird, but we love spending time together, even if there is no conversation.  We just like being with the other, whether it's sitting in the same room watching a movie, reading a book, or messing with our cat Fred.  We just like each other, and love each other and spending time together.

But we also have periods where one will be on the computer and the other in the basement, putzing with garden stuff or simply going through boxes of stuff, deciding to pitch or purge junk that's been in boxes for years.

I do understand the need for space and silence and private time alone.  But I also understand when tempers flair and emotions get the better part of a person and border out of control.  Being out of work or not having much money coming in to pay the rent or buy food can  and will have an emotional impact.  Fear and panic are never a good combination.

“Marriage is hard enough without bringing such low expectations into it.”

Sometimes simply going for a walk around the block to cool off and think can provide much needed clarity, if not a release for pent up stress."
2020-04-06 19:21:00,"Like the virus, abuse is frequently invisible, impacts people from every social level and victims can feel helpless to protect themselves.   
If officials had/have a plan to help DV victims, the first step would have been to close gun shops and liquor stores. Both are hardly essential.  
Identify buildings (hotels, dorms) which could be used as shelters  Set up both online and text hotlines.  Run PSAs detailing available resources alongside all of the COVID-19 messages.

2020-04-06 19:23:33,"Good and much-needed article. Yet I find it frustrating how the language obscure that intimate terrorism is predominantly men actively choosing to be violent towards women. The article begins, for instance, by stating that ""movement restrictions"" are ""making violence"" more severe. But it is not RESTRICTIONS that make violence more severe - it's largely men who choose to enact violence on others. And it is simply wrong to call this violence an 'opportunistic infection' - no, it's something that is actively carried out by men. Unless we are able to speak about this issue in a way that names the root of the problem, I don't see how we will solve it."

As if we didn't already know that domestic abuse is a problem worldwide (including right here in the US), now, in the midst of COVID, we need yet another headline that the COVID fallout has contributed to a spike in domestic abuse.  Who would have thought...that in addition to death, illness, financial ruin, more homelessness, more drug/alcohol abuse, a run on gun purchases, empty storefronts, a likely Economic Depression, mental health issues, a spike in divorces.... that there is now more domestic abuse?

Domestic abuse will continue to be an issue long after COVID, and something we will have to continue to tackle... the underlying issues that contribute to it.  

Really, what was the point of this story?  What was it trying to accomplish, except to add more gloom and doom to our day?  Are you suggesting that across the world, we should be housing all such domestic abuse victims elsewhere?  And if they are suffering abuse now, is it not fair to assume they were suffering it beforehand as well?  (Typically if a person is physically abusive to family members, there is no one 'trigger' to blame.  They will always have an excuse as to how the other person 'drove them' to behave that way, be it the stress of COVID quarantining, or that their family member simply looked at them the wrong way, or burned the toast."

The abusers should spent there evenings at the hospital when they finish their shift  so that they can be on call to clean whenever needed. 

 Want to be a abuser? then there is a price to pay during this pandemic.  Everyone is watching you and there are many jobs in the hospital that need to be done that are not medical.

This stereotypical abuse has been debunked many times before but the author just keeps going back to the classic stereotypes.

Men can and do get abused by women. They are extraordinarily less likely to go to the authorities because of the embarrassment  associated with that abuse,  whether it be physical or mental.

Men can be smacked, scratched, punched and demeaned just like a woman,  the difference is the damage is typically overlooked as something else."

As a reminder, there is “Journalism 101” -  Be clear and concise. Employ simple sentence form: subject, verb, object. Focus on the former, not the latter. Use active voice, concrete nouns and verbs. 

Then there is “Journalism 102” - apparently the standard for the subject matter of this article: Be ambiguous. Employ complex sentence forms. Focus on the object, not the subject. Use passive voice. Above all, obfuscate: write in abstractions and euphemisms, the wordier, the better. 

Example 1, words and phrases you should use often: domestic abuse, domestic violence, violence in the home, intimate terrorism, abusive relationship, abusive home, intimate partner abuse, spousal abuse, perpetrators of domestic abuse, psychological and physical mistreatment, victim. Oh yes, also, women. Use that word a lot.

Example 2, words you may use, but only rarely: husband, boyfriend.

We knew it was cabin fever causing them to snap. This morning, all five of them were out on their patio with their dog, chattering away. People are on edge, scared, nervous and braced for a fight.

If necessary, call police and encourage victims to press charges and file a restraining order. If you are kind and can manage it, put them up in a motel for a week until they can find lodging. Police need to jail abusers for several weeks or months, not several days."
2020-04-06 20:43:12,"This sad article adds one more item to the terrible ripple effects of a public health crisis on this scale. It's bad enough to be abused, but imagine the claustrophobic terror of not being able to leave an abuser due to a lockdown.

I urge everyone to read the following book. It is an extremely persuasive description of how abusive behavior works. It leans heavily towards covering male abusers because, unfortunately, they make up the majority of cases. But the book's details can be applied in all cases - including the probable fact that female abusers typically need to resort to manipulation and emotional control rather than physical abuse.

2020-04-06 20:34:04,"I had a talk with my local PD dispatcher.  They were worried about this at the outset and knew that once the money ran out, it would be unpleasant.  People divorce in good times, sell the house, and split the money.  In bad times, no one can leave a toxic situation.  Having been raised by a strong woman in a bad situation, one must make an exit, but one must be able to make that exit.  With society in lockdown, you can be imprisoned with your abuser with no exit..imagine if we had reasonable wages and health care."
2020-04-06 20:39:03,"As bad as it is for women, it is even worse for children.  Most child abuse calls to the hotline come from teachers and doctors. At the moment, children are not in school and doctors are not doing routine pediatric exams. I am in the field and heard on a call recently that the number of reports of maltreatment in a major American city are less than half of the normal volume. Hopefully, these children will be alive when all this is over."
2020-04-06 20:45:31,"According to available research, approximately 40% of domestic violence victims are men. How come this article only seems to mention women?

2020-04-06 20:47:38,"Why do people pair with violent and abusive individuals? Is it because they do not give a relationship enough time to see the true colors of someone? Is it because we no longer have a core family to care for each other and to respect each other? Is it because penalties against abusers are not harsh enough?
Ladies, be very suspicious of guys who shower you in flowers and want to ""take care"" of you. Sometimes, these are signs that the person is trying hard to present a certain false positive impression and trying to control you. 
Women should be more skeptical in their relationships and they should accept responsibility for their choices."

Why is housing so expensive (oh you mean the hedge funds own rentals and raise rents with aplomb) so people cannot afford to move out and live separately.

It's not the Coronavirus dearie.. It's lots of other things.. How about why aren't women paid as much as men ? Why didn't the equal rights amendment pass?  Why did people vote for Joe Biden over Elizabeth Warren?  Is misogyny part of our DNA?  Can we CRISPR out that gene?"
2020-04-06 20:57:38,"Neighbors should call police if they hear violent fights, ESPECIALLY IF CHILDREN are involved, and even knock on their doors to let them know that someone is listening to them. Even if cops are too busy right now to come the abusers will be aware that they don't have all the freedom in the world to let their anger run wild. Many times I wished my neighbors had called cops when we had bad fights at home. There's no shame in calling police or knocking on their doors."

2020-04-06 21:26:24,"If you are or think you may be in an abusive relationship, please go to www.thehotline.org.  More importantly, even with stay-at-home orders in place, I think every reasonable person would consider escaping from an abusive situation as essential travel. Please, feel empowered to do so.

Intimate partner violence takes on many forms. Physical violence understandably gets a lot of attention because the effects are most visible and often shocking. But emotional and mental abuse should not be discounted. They can be subtle and harder to detect and document to identify a pattern of abusive behavior. In any case, the perpetrator employs violence or a threat of violence to gain control and will often use escalating threats to maintain control.

If there is even the slightest chance that there is a threatening dynamic in your relationship, I implore you to read the available material on the hotline.org. Even if you're not in a situation that's on the abusive end of the spectrum, there is still a lot of good information about healthy boundaries and how to make them for yourself and with your partner."
2020-04-06 21:52:37,"We will soon cross a line in which the lives saved as a result of the lockdown will equal lives lost due to the consequences of the lockdown. If we do not negotiate that line with wisdom then the cure will prove to have been much worse than the disease. 

There is no acceptable reason to abuse a spouse and there is also no acceptable reason to continue to respond to a health crisis with an intervention that is increasingly doing much more harm than good."

2020-04-06 22:49:55,"Domestic violence advocates have always known that states high in ""isolation"" under normal circumstances (rural areas) can have more DV homicides per capita than other more concentrated populations.  For example, a few years ago Vermont was second only to Nevada in terms of DV homicides per capita (measured by the government as the number per 100,000 females). While the numbers were relatively low vs. more populous states, the per capita rate was high.  Now that we have extreme widespread isolation, the likelihood of this increase is understandable. Don't intervene yourself, don't try to ""solve"" the problem -- call your local, state or national DV hotlines for helpful suggestions and advice from DV advocates.  The national hotline is 1-800-799-7233."

I've stated many times, Television will blow up the world. You are seeing just the first symptoms of what will be an even bigger epidemic of reactions to all that aggravating media."

It is interesting that so many underlying social issues are being exacerbated by the lockdowns occurring all over the world.

2020-04-06 22:48:10,"We have a ""male"" problem in the world, especially in societies and religions that actually give men overt legal and religious domain and rights over the lives of women, young women and girls. But subtle, insidious forms of abuse against women are found in virtually EVERY society in the world. It seems something is off in the male brain where frustrations are amplified when men feel helpless and powerless.

So what is it about the male sex of our species in particular that so many are abusive (includes domestic, rape, physical, emotional, verbal abuse) toward women? I've observed it in little boys, teens, men and elderly men. Husbands, boyfriends, bosses, police, doctors, men in a positions of dominance, control and power. It can be opportunistic or premeditated or impulsive. What fragile part of the ego makes some men so obstinate and defiant, so hyper-alert to any perceived slight, that they are coiled like a spring to flex their might against a physically weaker human, to manipulate and coerce and force another human to bend to his will and whim. It's sick, antisocial, sociopathic behavior."

2020-04-06 23:21:52,"Great, important article

But I disagree with the language of “public health crisis” and “infection”

This is a criminal issue resulting from decisions made by men who have agency and are responsible for their actions. It is not a virus, or a function of these new circumstances.

That the current situation with coronavirus has exacerbated domestic violence to this degree is evidence of how widespread the relationships, power structures, and conditions which enable it already were."
2020-04-07 00:50:48,"I worked in a domestic violence prevention agency for four years in the 1990s.  We were under funded then I don’t suppose it’s much better now.  We have to insist on shelters such as hotel rooms for every community or we will loose lives to domestic violence, not only women but children. Also remember, people need to get out and walk a bit or let off steam- so make sure to allow this too to save lives!"
2020-04-07 01:41:56,One thing the pandemic makes clear: Myriad serious social ills that were not vanquished before the virus struck will certainly not be remediated right now.
2020-04-07 00:36:43,"Thank you for this article.    We need an urgent response. 

There is an  Acting Director within the US Justice Department regarding Domestic Violence  Hopefully, the Acting Director or someone will put together a Task Force to initiate a clear action plan very soon.   ""Fragile resources are overwhelmed""

 Men, women and especially the children need our help more than ever.  It is real, it is happening and it will escalate during the Pandemic and the economic fallout. It's not going away.

As the article stated,  Hotels can also be Safehouses.  The are plenty of empty hotels.   The National Guard can possibly guard the lobbies.  Hard to imagine this concept in the US but what is a real-world solution?

Victims need to be lifted out of these terrifying homes.

The Police cannot possibly continue to help Corona Virus patients and the increasing numbers of Domestic Violence victims at the same time.   Their ranks are compromised already with officers out sick.   

  Maybe the National Guard can assist, support and help Police when needed.

2020-04-07 08:20:45,"I agree that it is terrible that so many women are in constant terror of their partners and are, or feel they are, unable to leave these terrible situations.  On this progressives and I agree.

What I find strange is that progressives, despite seeing how dominated some people are by others, continue to support mail-in voting, where the abusers are completely free to direct their abused partner to vote the ""correct"" way and then ""harvest"" (as is the case in California and other progressive states) the wholly involuntary vote.  And, of course, violent spouses are only one aspect of these involuntary ""votes"" -- there are others, such as elder abuse, association abuse (vote the ""correct"" way in front of your union/employer or lose your job), purchase of votes (whether for cash or drugs) and so on.

Mail-in (or computer) voting is the exact opposite of the secret ballot, which protects the weak from the strong in a free society."

The issue is male violence. Don't use men killing each other to deflect from the real issue of domestic and intimate partner violence and fatal domestic violence committed by men against women. People say there is a ""battle of the sexes,"" but if there is a war then it is one waged against women & girls everyday by men who beat, rape and murder women in their own home. No government has made a concerted, national effort to end men's violence against women (including femicide/feminicdio), and women continue to be injured and die everyday at the hands of men."
2020-04-07 10:04:34,"The story of LeLe and the high chair episode would happen exactly the same way before covid too. No one cares. Police show up at your home annoyed you called them out for a DV incident. They tell you to leave the abuser. Women face abject poverty if they leave. You end up taking a beating so you have shelter and food. 
Domestic violence is much the same problem outside of any pandemic. Mothers cannot afford to leave and arrange a private living situation away from their abuser. Even before covid, living wage jobs were scarce. Apartment rent, food, childcare, transportation, utilities and insurance require a min of 2k a month and that's a shoestring budget in an affordable area. Jobs paying 2k a month were in short supply BEFORE covid. Leaving an abusive predator ABSOLUTELY requires a job. 
We could also shift the abuse response from ""women need to leave"" to ""hey men, quit abusing,"" but from my 911 calls, counseling, family advice, and books on the matter...the standard response is ""leave him."" Not one person has ever confronted my husband to quit being abusive. Leaving is idealistic, unrealistic and unreasonable advice resulting in trapped women who just quit discussing their situation because they know they'll be told to leave, and they can't afford it. Before you know it you're lying to friends and family about why your lip is black and blue or split. Yes it's a horrible example for your kids to watch but those same kids need to eat. Being a check out clerk won't cover that"

There are so many things to do in life. Even at home.  I suppose it is the fear more than anything. And men, in particular don't handle fear well ..."

2020-04-07 15:38:08,"In my opinion, domestic violence does not result from small things accumulating or from exposure to violence on TV or video games as some have suggested. Whether initiated by men or women, and both can be aggressors, I think it results from large and deep feelings of self-inadequacy, frustration, and shame that are projected onto their partners in the mistaken belief that by lashing out they can reduce those feelings. Those who have attained a measure of inner peace are not violent. Long term solutions to this problem must start with self awareness: feeling those uncomfortable feelings, gaining understanding of them, realizing we have a choice when they are triggered, and rising above them over time. In the short term, spouses and others need adequate protection and safety."
2020-04-07 17:33:24,"Stress contributes to domestic abuse and we are all under extra stress right now, with incomes and routines disrupted.  My former husband was most abusive when he was unemployed, as many are now.  The less secure abusers feel, the more they try to control others.  Unfortunately, we have a piecemeal response system in the United States.  But we need to make sure that every potential and actual victim knows how to get to safety, whom to call and perhaps most importantly, how to keep the abuser calm if possible."
2020-04-07 16:36:50,"In addition to all of the aforementioned problems, I am also concerned about the potential for sexual sexual abuse of both women and children. (I know that there are women who are sexual abusers, but those numbers are still low.)"
2020-04-07 16:33:21,"This story is largely fiction studded with cherry-picked  incidents. The reality,  at least in Maine, is a drop in calls to the domestic abuse hotline by 23%; and few police calls. My own observations are of family reunification; entire families out for hikes and bike rides and working around the house.

I wonder if the shuttered public school, freed from its role as a substitute parent, has reduced in-school tensions and interpersonal conflict?  How much of domestic abuse is related to child rearing anyway?  Dads playing baseball with their sons? Moms running with their daughters? and this is a bad thing??"
2020-04-06 22:58:00,"I am a man, and I have never understood domestic violence. The woman you ""love"", have children with, etc., and then you beat her up. Growing up, I never saw any physical altercation between my parents. My father was a naval commander and used to having his ""orders"" obeyed but he never gave my mother orders, it was always cordial and respectful... and this is in a ""Muslim"" country where men typically ""rule.""
In my opinion, as the old English saying goes, familiarity breeds contempt is what is going on here. When two people get married, attached, they need to get to grips with each other and adapt to each other's ways and try to better each other. If this is not possible, then just put in a filter in your mind and start to ignore the short comings of the other. 

Small things, like where to squeeze the tooth paste, or how the toilet paper rolls, just ignore that stuff. I do in my own house. I absolutely do not care about certain things anymore. I detest, peeling of the onions, potatoes, etc. in the sink and then having to clean that trash from the sink and throwing it in the bin. Guess what? My Moroccan wife will not change this behavior, even though I nudged her politely why create double the work. So, I ignore it. Why bother. My daughter always tells me, dad you do not get upset about things. My answer: don't sweat the small stuff... good book I read long time ago and I recommend it."

Verifone requires all buttons be selected with the light pen as well as the signature. A signature isn't necessary especially when the slippery plastic wand sliding across the screen combined with your unsupported hand makes it unrecognizable. Most people just draw a line across the box and it makes no difference. It has been reported that Verifone was going to discontinue the use of signatures anyway. Selecting buttons on a screen can be done more safely with a gloved finger, or the back of a knuckle or with a pen or pencil."

Living in a house where they are constantly outgassing isn't doing anyone any favors, but the medical establishment has to pick on the 'moral' issues of smoking, as if it is only personal behavior that puts us at risk.

I also think vaping promotes more constant inhaling, like smoking cigarettes, while I typically have one or two ""tokes"" and that's fine.

Although bronchial biopsies from habitual marijuana smokers have shown precancerous histopathologic changes, a large cohort study and a pooled analysis of six well-designed case-control studies have not found evidence of a link between marijuana smoking and lung cancer. The immunosuppressive effects of delta-9 tetrahydrocannabinol raise the possibility of an increased risk of pneumonia, but further studies are needed to evaluate this potential risk.""

In other words, there is no solid evidence that smoking or vaping marijuana compromises the lungs in the way that tobacco/nicotine does or in the way described in the article. If such evidence exists, please point to it.  

While it is noble of NYT to promote breathing ""clean air"", I expect more science and less speculation when it comes to associating marijuana with tobacco."

It makes no distinction, however, and seems to be unaware that MJ can be eaten as well as vaped without oil but rather directly with a vaporizer that allows access to fractional distillation of essential oils in the flower rather than burning it to ash, leaving the dried out, still green and unburned nug behind."

Edibles, capsules, tincture are also excellent delivery methods.  I am in my mid-50’s, and medical marijuana was my only post-op pain relief after 2 major surgeries in the past year.  It worked so much better than anything else!  They can pry my legal medical cannabis out of my cold dead hands.

There is still no evidence to support the assertion that vaping causes lung issues. While some 2,600 people got sick and 59 died from vaping in the U.S. no cases were found in the UK. You might be wondering, why is that, well, unlike republicans who hate regulations, (remember they’ve relaxed the air pollution regulations), the British embrace them.  In Britain, a manufacturer or importer of e-cigarettes must submit a notification to the authorities six months in advance of a product launch and is subject to strict product-safety regulations, including toxicological testing of the ingredients and emissions, as well as rules ensuring tamper-proof and leakproof packaging. Stimulants, colorings and vitamin additives are tightly regulated.

Few such regulations exist in the U.S. For many observers, this explains the higher injury rate: “What’s happening in the U.S. is not happening here [in Britain], nor is it happening in any other countries where vaping is common,” says John Britton, director of the U.K. Centre for Tobacco & Alcohol Studies at Nottingham University."

I'm convinced the reason that I NEVER get colds, flus, or even strange new viruses is because my lungs are full of medical marijuana.  Good luck finding your intended target, virus, after a few puffs of my night-time blend!

Vaping:  people are confusing vaping with pot.  Vaping can either be just vaping cannabis with no additives OR it can be cannabis oil suspended in glycerol or some similar oil-based carrier.  These oil-based products that are making people sick.  I tried a cartridge one night and coughed the entire time and almost hurled my guts.  Went back to straight up weed and no issues.

I think the article is on point for vaping tobacco products, which have all manner of solvents, flavorings, and other ingredients that are not disclosed on the labels... not to mention nicotine is officially categorized as a poison. 

Where I think the article goes astray is lumping legalized tested and quality controlled MMJ into the mix.  I get that they are simply relaying the blanket advice given to them by medical researchers.... but it is missing context. 

Further, the non psychoactive component of MMJ, CBD, is non-toxic either inhaled or eaten, and yet has extremely beneficial anti-inflammatory qualities to it.  Given that it is runaway inflammation in the lungs due to cytokene storm effects from the immune system.... CBD may actually be an over looked mediator of symptoms (though research is required to know this for sure).

Where are your citations, what studies are you referring to. The UK has done extensive studies on vaping, and have found vaping to be a safe alternative to smoking. In fact, in the UK, Since May 2017, all e-cigarettes and e-liquids have had to be notified to The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency before they can be sold. There are also requirements around labelling and warnings. Certain ingredients including colourings, caffeine and taurine are banned, and the nicotine strength of e-liquids is restricted. There have been no deaths and few if any cases of lung illness directly attributed to vaping in the U.K. A recent study has concluded that vaping is now helping up to 70,000 people stop smoking every year by reaching those who failed to quit smoking by other means. “The British public have voted with their feet and are choosing to use e-cigarettes. This is a positive choice, and we should promote it,” says Prof. Linda Bauld of Cancer Research U.K."

I vape because I quit smoking several years ago. If there isn't any hard evidence to suggest that it adversely affects the lungs, why include it in the article? It reads like the Fox News troupe ""Some people say.."".

I can physically feel the difference in my lungs after several years of not smoking... just because you don't want your teenager to use vaping products doesn't mean that they are anywhere as bad for people as cigarettes."
2020-04-09 20:34:45,"Modest proposal: dispense Happy Pills. I vape and smoke (California-legal) dope—and this is the worst possible circumstance for quitting. I’m in the most vulnerable population and haven’t stepped outside my house for over 4 weeks. At the same time I’m cranking most of my waking hours to get my classes online and scrambling to keep up. And I’m in a much, much better position than most people because I’m a tenured professor. I’m drinking to cope. I’ve never done depression and don’t like feeling bad, so my aim is to feel as good as I can in the circumstances—locked into my house and cranking to produce homework, worksheets, powerpoints, and Zoom recordings. And dealing with desperate students.

Give us pills! Speed, Vicodan, anything to get us high so that we can feel better! I’d much rather have pills than booze because alcohol is fattening. We don’t have pills to help with COVID-19 but we do have pills to make us feel better and get us high. Give us feel-good drugs!"

All the news though, seems to mention diabetes, hypertension and other diet and obesity related conditions when discussing underlying risks.  Why not cut off sales of ice cream and candy?  Advocating to outlaw major anxiety ameliorating substances in the time of the greatest stressor of our time is ignorant and insensitive.      

The perpetual anti smoking / anti vape crowd needs to give it a rest. Believing people are going to give up a vice in a time of crisis is as smart as thinking it's safe in the first place. Beleieving people will give up marijuana, well that pretty much explains why it needs to be legalized."

Smoking goes down slightly here each year.  But I really, really wish that after this is over there is a campaign to get French people to stop smoking as much once and for all.

Whether I smoke or vape, I already can't do it in a closed environment, so ""possible"" transmission by the exhaled vapor is a ludicrous premise to hang a ban on.

Why don't we instead argue that everyone must smoke so people can see just how far the vapor cloud we exhale actually extends? Oh, I know why, because the idea is ridiculous.

Yes I would be healthier if I stopped vaping, and I would be healthier if I had never smoked. I also would be healthier if cars running on petroleum based products were illegal.

Does it make sense for the government to insist that you have to be an adult to buy these products? Of course it does.

Does it make sense for the government to forbid adults from climbing mountains because they could fall? Of course it doesn't.

2020-04-09 22:50:51,"It's only logical, if you compromise your lungs in any way, you predispose yourself to worse effects of any ailment.  I know this, having survived the flu bug in 1976.  I was 23 yrs old, a pack a day smoker developed over 4 years, caught the flu (Asian?), settled into my lungs, I contracted bronchitis, then pneumonia.  I had never been so sick in my life.  I coughed myself to sleep, sleeping on my knees because I could not lay on my back, front, or sides.  Sleep lasted in shifts, 2-4hrs.  I would awaken in a coughing attack, spit up brown sputum, sit in the living room for 20 minutes until I was exhausted again, repeat pattern.  This went on for 10 days.  I was 125lbs when it started, under 110 when it finished.  Do I even need to say I quit cigarettes cold turkey immediately?  For years after, anytime I contracted a cold, it would affect my lungs.   
  But hey, you can play the ""what about"" game and deny your vaping and smoking (whatever substance) isn't killing you, until Covid-19 comes along.  Our lungs are so delicate, it's a wonder we live as long as we do.  To intentionally harm them is insane.  Dying from lung ailments is suffocating to death.  I cannot think of a worse way to pass."

I have tried quitting smoking 7 times and the first 6 times I gained an average of 38 lbs each time.  The last time I was only off for 2 weeks and only gained 20 lbs.   Right now I am dieting, trying to lose enough weight to try to quit again, but I have to lose enough weight so that I can gain 40 lbs back and still walk half-normally.   

Since last May I have lost 85 lbs but still have another 65 lbs to go to reach my goal of 275 lbs, which I weighed in my 40s before I tried to quit smoking.  I have no desire to weigh 380 lbs or more again so I guess I will keep smoking for now.  

As for outlawing marijuana again I am afraid that the cat is too far out of the bag.   I am in-favor of legalized marijuana as I feel strongly that the damage caused by the criminal justice system to those caught with marijuana is far worse than the public health damage inflicted by its use.  Here in Colorado we have seen a 15% reduction in violent crime since we legalized marijuana.  

How about shutting-off alcohol sales during our crisis to try to reduce the increased incidence of spousal and child abuse that our stay-at-home shut-down has caused?   I don't see public health advocates calling for that.  Why not?"

Nor, might I add, did any of those questions ask if I had in the recent past taken prescription pain medications. You can't treat what you don't know, and the box-checking rote mentality of checklist medical consultation is an active barrier to good medical practice and diagnosis. 

This is just as bad as the idiotic questions I was still being asked, in mid-March, about travel to China, well after community transmission of COVID-19 was evident in my state. Simply fulfilling the checklist of government guidelines is not enough, especially if you're filling them at the receptionist counter, stationed behind a room full of patients, combating a virus that has hidden transmission and long incubation.

Inhaling tobacco in any form, as well as smoking cannabis, absolutely puts one at risk of developing serious health conditions, including cancer. Inhaling vapour from cannabis oil concentrate may also pose risks, although there isn’t much high quality data, so the degree of that risk is unclear.  

But, as far as I know, there is no data that shows that vaping cannabis flower carries risks at all comparable to those of smoking. In fact, the data I’ve seen shows that vaping cannabis carries much less risk than most other substances — dramatically less than the risk from consuming the socially acceptable, popular hard drug that is alcohol. 

Medical cannabis provides real, tangible health benefits to many people. Publications with huge platforms like the NYTimes should exercise more care and consider nuance when writing about such topics. Because there are many people who use pieces like this to further their agenda, and prevent people like me from accessing a medicinal substance that can improve one’s quality of life."

Vaping, using the Juul device especially, is enabling many smokers to quit. Once off smokes, it’s relatively easy to scale back nicotine strength until the addiction is neutralized. If not possible, there is at least the benefit of freedom from poisonous smoke, a proven killer, entering your lungs.

Tobacco bans certainly look good right now, don't they? Another possibility that you didn't mention here is drastically raising taxes on cigarettes and legal marijuana. At worst it might raise more revenue for badly stretched state and local governments. At best it will save lives. What's not to like about that? (No need to hurry lowering them once this is all over.)

Hate to be judgmental about this, but we can spare only so much sympathy for drug addicts who go through the miseries of withdrawal, as you put it, if that means saving lives.

As someone who last quit (several times!) 25 years ago, I can attest to a couple things: one is that I cannot imagine going through the anguish of quitting while also dealing with the incredible stress of the situation.  While I'm sure that smokers touch their face quite often, I doubt this habit somehow disappears with the smokes; there's typically a period where pens, fingernails and God knows what bear the brunt of the smoker's oral habits.  It is notable that the last medical institutions to ban smoking were psychiatric ones.  Secondly, as far as vaping goes, except for  for the well publicized problems with off market pot vapes, most studies suggest significantly less lung damage with vaping.  Maybe this is a good time for tobacco smokers to switch to vaping."

Covid19 sure precipitated the matter. I have friends and relatives who are doctors dealing with Covid patients; they attest that nearly 100% of the young ones in the hospital (20s and 30s) are vapers or pot smokers (tobacco cigarettes having remained unpopular). And what's funny is when the doctors ask them if they smoke, they say ""no, never...well pot, but that doesn't count."" Yes, yes it does count. Big time.

Social distancing  and the wearing of masks have been mandated to help us avoid contracting the COVID 19 virus by breathing in aerosolized particles coming from people infected with the disease, whether expelled by their coughing, sneezing, talking or even their breathing.

If the virus can be spread by exposure to aerosolized / airborne particles emitted by infected people, it stands to reason that smoke exhaled by an infected smoker could be a carrier of the virus to anyone who happens to breathe it in. 

 Because smoke is made up of fine particulate matter, it could, logically, act as a transporter of the COVID-19 virus  when exhaled from an infected person's lungs, and travel much farther than  the ‘social distancing’ parameters mandated by the government and the CDC, especially when wind borne.

Nearly 14 of every 100 people, 34.2 million adults, in the US smoke.   If the COVID-19 virus can indeed be spread / transmitted by inhaling the second hand smoke of infected tobacco users, the public should be informed, educated and warned of the potential harm in doing so, and, as an added precaution, possibly instituting a nationwide ban on smoking in public for the interim does  not seem unreasonable.

I don't know how I got on Mr. Buchanan's email/phone tree, but I'm on it. The procedure is that you tell an ""aide"" what your question is, and then you are taped asking the question (taped because of fears of a profanity-laden tirade, I suppose), and eventually the congressman responds. I've been on such a call a time or two.
My question went like this: Twenty-five percent or more of infected people are asymptomatic, and people can have coronavirus for 1-14 days before manifesting symptoms. On March 9, one month ago, Mr. Trump repeatedly stated ""anybody that needs a test can get a test; the tests are beautiful"" while he toured the CDC. So, my question to you is simple: Can you please share the addresses of places in the tri-county area where I can get tested.
When a Republican congressman dips into his phone tree, you know there'll be a whole lotta Republicans on the call. And there were.
And, perhaps not surprisingly, like a profanity-laden tirade, like the questions I've asked on other ""town hall"" telephone ""meetings,"" this particular question was a little too much for Mr. Buchanan: After 48 minutes of being on hold, the program concluded, without me having had opportunity to ask what I think is the most important point of this situation: Where are those ""perfect"" tests that Trump bragged about?

True, most mutations are either deleterious (and unseen), or neutral.  The neutral ones can hardly be said to be boring when without such mutations there would be no capacity for molecular epidemiology.

We needed coordinated travel advisories, quarantines, and tracking of people who'd traveled, and we needed millions of tests, ready to go.

An article in the Times noted that NY was late  in reacting; that isn't a political statement, it is just fact. The virus was here already, circulating from multiple entry points.  The politics come in when we look at why. And fundamentally the ""why"" begins with being totally unprepared.

Going forward, when we want to start bringing people out of their bunkers, we are going to need to know if the virus starts circulating widely again. 

We are going to need to know where the risks are - as we now know that Italy was a greater risk than China - and how to catch early signs of re-circulation. I'd look to the CDC but that is fruitless.

2020-04-09 11:52:13,"I know next to nothing about virology, but this article makes me wonder.
Could there be different mutations of the coronavirus that manifest themselves in some humans as being fatal, in others like a bad flu, and in others as not much at all?   So how bad it is depends on which “version” is involved. OK, individual immune systems and pre-existing conditions are also  in the mix, so those variables get in the way, but the more we learn about this virus the more complex it seems to get. And, I assume, harder to develop a vaccine for."

2020-04-09 11:59:31,"I sequestered myself on February 25th because my husband is immunocompromised and I have spent enough time in JFK to know how many people arrive from Europe on any given day. The minute it was confirmed in Italy I knew it would be a massive problem here. I don’t understand how no one else figured that out. First there was a limit on groups of 500. Then 250. Then 10. All arbitrary, nonsensical numbers. All it takes is one person. If this administration had anything approaching an empathetic brain cell they could have avoided this entire thing. The only thing we can do now is stay home, hope for the best, and vote them out in November. Preferably by mail."
2020-04-09 12:01:32,"It’s very interesting from a scientific viewpoint, but these days the information is too often used for political purposes.

2020-04-09 12:05:00,"I’ve been following Trevor Bedford’s twitter account and the Nextstrain mapping project for a couple months and it has been a welcome relief from all the disinformation out there. Reading the map, as best a layperson can, has given a clear picture of how the virus has spread globally, what strains have travelled where, and also how the virus’s makeup could eventually lead to a vaccine.  The maps are visually beautiful and it has been thrilling to watch them develop but you never forget that you are watching a nightmare unfold in real time. 

The Nextstrain team in Washington state and the scientists on the East Coast are all to be congratulated for their important work which will culminate in a real medical resolution of this deadly virus. There are many more scientists globally, including those in China, who are workng collaboratively across boundaries, all with the same purpose.  It’s what they do but it’s also noble in a humble way.

Keep your eyes on the evidence-based, peer-reviewed science not on the quacks dispensing ineffective pills and potions because they can to a desperate population."
2020-04-09 12:05:16,"I would hope that as the country -- in fact, the world -- moves forward figuring out how we can all safely live with this virus in our midst, Congress will actually fund the science research, the CDC,  WHO and all those who need to do the research to help develop safety protocols and methods of tracking (and stopping) outbreaks. One of the reasons we lost valuable time in the beginning (thereby contributing to greater loss of life), is the Trump administration DE-funded many of the institutions that could have, would have, contributed expertise for monitoring and managing the growing crisis. Moving forward we need to get it right, or we will have another round of now... This administration failed abominably on its watch."

2020-04-09 12:02:31,"Ironic that the spread of the virus was due to the jet-setting class, while the brunt of the pain will be borne by the rising ranks of unemployed workers and devoted medical professionals. 
It seems arrogant and callous to shut down the entire economy. The managerial classes can always Zoom from their living rooms. The wealthy can hide out on their yachts. Meanwhile small businesses and wage earners fight for survival. 
Keep the quarantine on the wealthy elites, the executives and the frail. Prioritize testing and treatment for the essential people of our economy - the workers. Let the healthy workers, who are tested, get back to work and the small businesses re-open, now."

Not true. On 2/28 my husband returned to NYC from Western Germany, where he attended “karnival.” He traveled home with textbook symptoms, with no screening. On 3/1 we took him to Mt. Sinai ER. The ER doc was not allowed to test him because Germany was not on the CDC list. 4 days later I had high fever and cough. I called my doctors, city healthcare lines, and went to an urgent care. Every step we were told that Germany isn’t on the “list,” and not taken seriously. An UWS urgent care doctor bragged about not wearing a mask near me to make a point. 

Many healthcare professionals, following (forced or blindly) CDC guidelines, were oblivious. Some regular people saw the writing on the wall."

At the same time, I am both amazed and highly impressed at the lengths the NYT will go -- in this case, all the way to the molecular level -- to do what it can to deny the reviled Mr. Trump any credit whatsoever in his attempts to both contain and mitigate this contagion.

Although your editorial page leaves something to be desired, I love my NYT subscription.  In fact, I do not believe that I have ever, in my 60 years, felt so satisfied with a purchase I have made."

But it is unbelievably reckless irresponsible that we refused to test widely and thoroughly from the start. Trump must not be allowed to rewrite history on this."

2020-04-09 12:10:54,"The crucial mistake, which was shared by US and European public health authorities, was the belief that a potentially lethal virus could not be symptom-free in a large fraction of cases. It was assumed that identifying anyone with Covid-19 would be easy. We now know that 25-50% (according to the CDC) may be asymptomatic, and that another large fraction have minor symptoms. As recently as mid-February the respected German public health institutions, the Robert Koch Institute, was denying that asymptomatic infection was possible. 
Covid-19 has a set of characteristics that we were just not ready for - easily transmitted (just in the breath), lots of carriers with no or mild symptoms, but lethal for perhaps 1%."

Nature can be cruel, but it's also incredible. One thing that this whole pandemic has demonstrated is how far we've come in only the past few decades in understanding the science of life.

Sure, if I was abroad, I would want to be home with friends and family, but if it is about keeping the population safe, shouldn't they have found another solution, or at least addressed that during the briefing?  Yes, I support my president, even Trump, during this challenging time, but watching him talk is often a very painful experience."
2020-04-09 12:18:15,"Thank you for this excellent, groundbreaking research. However, this work does not exclude the possibility of COVID cases in January. There was no testing for COVID. There were ""atypical"" pneumonia cases, especially at ""walk in"" clinics in areas like Brooklyn as early as the first week of January. According to reports from individuals living in those areas, some had abnormal chest imaging but ""negative"" influenza testing, and while very ill, recovered at home, in a form of ""self isolation"". It would be worthwhile to examine all chest images taken during the month of January at least for unexplained abnormalities. Using case finding, it would then be possible to obtain volunteers for COVID antibody testing or other testing. This might help us better understand when this virus actually arrived in an international city like New York."
2020-04-09 12:18:35,"""While the coronavirus mutations are useful for telling lineages apart, they don’t have any apparent effect on how the virus works.""

What does this mean? Our bodies do not react differently -- mild to fatal symptoms -- depending on the coronavirus strain as they mutate? So the virus that came from China is no less or more harmful than the one from Europe?

Also does that mean we might not need more than one vaccine, one for each major coronavirus strain? Unlike common flu vaccines that aren't effective for some virus strains every year as the viruses have mutated?"
2020-04-09 12:21:47,"Italy imposed a ban on flights from China on 31 January, immediately after a Chinese couple in Rome tested positive for the virus.

This retired RN is curious....."

Several readers have expressed that they had a nasty and long-lasting illness that had symptoms that sounded suspicious, including me.  I live in an area with a relatively large population of Chinese newcomers who travel back and forth extensively.

But considering our present government is using this catastrophe as a political issue to be distorted and exploited, I guess we'll never know."

We heard nothing about this virus until we returned. My husband and daughter had it really bad, but when they went to the doctor there was no testing in place for this. It was azithromycin and a albuterol pump you help her breathe."
2020-04-09 12:32:39,"I know a few people who were sick and had COVID symptoms after Christmas and in January. Since there was no testing available at that time when all eyes were on China, it seems presumptuous to assume any origin at this point."

2020-04-09 12:12:54,Excellent and informative reporting. Detail you will not get from televised news (PBS being an exception). What this all points to is the all too predictable failure of the Trump administration to get out in front of this virus.
2020-04-09 12:25:26,"“The deepest branches of the tree all belong to lineages from China.”
That is misinformation
The reason why Nextstrain’s phylogeny has Wuhan’s virus as the root is because they made that virus the reference point. Nextstrain made that the assumption. Nextstrain cannot prove not disprove the origin. Nextstrain can make another phylogeny using the Italian strain as the reference point as well, if it wanted to."
2020-04-09 12:34:12,"It is not surprising, just like Northern Italy has a large Chinese population, NJ NY has a large Italian Diaspora.

Flights from JFK, LGI, Newark to Italy in February is cheap, and also hotels.

Plus the students who have the option to study abroad to complete credits.

This may also explain the surge in Cook County IL, as some of the suburbs of Cook County, Little Italy in downtown have been hot-spots.

Facts matter, and now we need to fix this."
2020-04-09 12:10:41,"“People were just oblivious,” said Adriana Heguy, a member of the N.Y.U. team.

Because China kept this information from the world, denying it could be transmitted person-to-person.  That was a game changer. China only acknowledged it after the WHO visited Wuhan and announced testing there ""suggested"" human-to-human transmission.  It had just denied publicly that ""close contact"" was causing transmission."
2020-04-09 12:17:14,"Amazing science.

Vaccine next?
Or a working treatment?

 Hope so.

So that action by trump to block entry from China? Not such a big deal. 
And stopping entry from Europe? Did that happen? Yeah. March 11. I guess that’s the action he should have taken at the same time as China.

Will he start calling coronavirus the French virus? UK virus? Italian virus? (Spanish virus was taken in 1918.) maybe some other epithet."
2020-04-09 12:35:38,"Thank you.  This acknowledge the question I had regarding the effect of mutation interference on the development of a vaccine.

2020-04-09 12:37:02,"So, is there a team of virologists taking samples from horseshoe bats in China and any and every animal that might be an intermediary species? Has China yet explained why they shut down and sanitized the Wuhan seafood market without taking any samples from the animals and meat being sold there? I read in a more scientific article that taking samples at the market would have been ""Epidemiology 101,"" and yet China did not do it. Why no reporting or discussion in the mainstream media of the quest for the origin of this virus? It is not surprising if conspiracy theories abound if the question of the origin of the virus is being brushed to the side."
2020-04-09 12:39:35,Maybe someone can answer this.  My Long Island NY son had a nasty respiratory illness mid January to early Feb. He was tested for strep and  flu and the result was negative. After the third visit he was told he had mono.  I know there is a test specifically for mono but I also know sometimes it gets diagnosed by exclusion. How often do Drs actually test for mono?  .  I will call the Dr today as well.
2020-04-09 12:41:19,"My wife and I were in Germany and Portugal the last 2 weeks of February this year. Cases were already being reported in Europe. There was a story in this newspaper on Feb 26 reporting cases across Austria, Greece, Croatia, Germany, Italy, Spain and Switzerland -- and of course, South Korea. The last week of February we were in Lisbon and worried that we would get stranded there given the rapidly increasing number of cases in Italy and Spain.

And yet, when we boarded our flight from Lisbon to NYC on Feb 29, the only screening we had was to be asked whether we had been in China -- no questions about being in Italy or Spain or any other country where cases had been reported. No checking for a fever. I applaud the government for shutting down flights from China at the end of January, and yet in my view they should have shut down flights -- or at least screened travelers -- from other countries much, much sooner."
2020-04-09 12:41:30,"Forgive me as I'm not a doctor or biologist. But if this virus mutates quickly enough that we can track where it came from, is there a concern that it will also be mutating fast enough that immunity and vaccines will be less effective at preventing future spread?"
2020-04-09 12:43:07,I've been waiting for the NYT science writers to get deeper into the ongoing work with the genomes. You did not disappoint. Thank you for this story and for future coverage of a worldwide effort to understand and cope with this.
2020-04-09 12:43:45,"One, while it's good that the geneticists can definitively trace the viruses in NYC to Europe, anyone can figure that out based on the fact that NYC is the gateway to Europe. So stopping most flights from China early helps mitigate this pandemic on the west coast. Not doing so with flights from Europe for more than a month later leaves places like NYC wide open to this disease.

Two, unless the numbers from China are wildly inaccurate, the virulence of this virus in Italy, Spain, and now NY shows the virus has mutated for the worse.

Three, once the virus has been shown to transmit from person to person by the mere fact of breathing and absent a cure, social distancing and international travel ban are the only effective way to stop this virus. The fact that WHO came out against international travel ban against China while commending domestic travel ban inside China speaks volumes about the politicization of WHO itself.

Four, while there is no evidence that the virus is man made, it's foolish to rule that out completely. Up until recently few computer security experts could have guessed that state security agencies possess an arsenal of computer viruses so effective, i.e. security agencies know more about Microsoft Windows than Microsoft itself. So it's entirely feasible that military labs are further ahead in bioweapons than currently known. Furthermore even if this virus has not been manufactured in a lab it doesn't mean it can't be reengineered to be a weapon from now on."
2020-04-09 12:45:37,"The half-hearted China travel ban was doomed to fail from its beginning.

Because of the virus’ robust transmissibility, to be effective the travel ban would have had to ban entry of any person who had come into contact with someone who had come into contact with someone from China.  

The only possible way to contain the contagion was to test aggressively.  And we failed.

To understand the disease, we need to test aggressively.  And we are stilly failing.

Return to some semblance of normalcy requires aggressive testing and we are still failing."
2020-04-09 12:46:01,"Thank you for this story. For weeks now I've been wondering why there hasn't been better reporting in the American news media about the rapid mutations involving RNA viruses in general, and COVID-19 in particular. The quickly mutating nature of all RNA viruses means that there are a myriad of ways that COVID-19 has spread throughout the world, and blaming one country, or one government, is futile when it seems that most governments (with a few notable exceptions such as South Korea and Germany) have done a poor job of tracking the virus (and its offspring)."
2020-04-09 12:34:58,"The US can detect any missile launch anywhere in the world in minutes and launch a counterattack soon after if the missiles are headed here.  Yet the US has no clue of a dangerous virus spread from afar, not because we don’t know how to track that but because we somehow have decided that this was not a problem to spend resources on. Sadly for us, viruses don't show up on missiles.  A national tragedy caused by a monumental blunder."

Fever, severe little or no appetite, impaired sense of taste and smell, nausea, digestive problems, constant coughing, violent chills for7 days accompanied by unusually painful body aches, followed by a period of severe exhaustion and mental fog.
Because at the time I was not a candidate for testing and it had happened in February when no one suspected Covid-19 was already in N.Y., there was no way to confirm what I had. Thank you for verifying that as i suspected, I could indeed have had the disease in mid February."

We had a vicious outbreak of...something...in Northern California in November and December. Scores of people who'd had the flu shot still came down with ""the flu""--aches, fever, weird dry cough.

2020-04-09 12:57:48,"Fascinating article.  Thank you to all those virologists, epidemiologists and others in the scientific community who are working to better understand this virus and find solutions.

Countries should not be easing lockdowns unless they’ve done mass testing of everyone. To beat this virus and resume normal life, mass testing is the key. Those individuals that test positive are quarantined for 14 days. Others are permitted to go to work and resume their daily life. Re-testing needs to be done to ensure that those that tested negative are still negative. This cycle would need to be repeated until a vaccine is identified. So broad base testing must be a priority. The process needs to be simplified and should free."
2020-04-09 12:57:58,"This was an interesting read. Thank you for publishing it.

There is widespread hope of scientists developing a vaccine. However I am puzzled by a thought: we have vaccines for the flu, but I can’t recall there ever being a vaccine for the common cold. My understanding is that COVID 19 is a novel coronavirus and that the common cold is a type of coronavirus as well. If that’s the case is hope for a COVID 19 vaccine misplaced?"

I find this a complete hodgepodge of information that is really difficult to rationally explain.  If the viruses play lottery, they would have won many more times so far in human history.   Why are they winning so often recently, and in some specific areas is an interesting question to ask.  This mega-win for the scourge is likely to be of keen interest for many more years from now, expect a lot of scientific (and otherwise) clashes about it."

One of many things that saddens me is that this pandemic seems to be worsening another epidemic that has been psychology killing us for decades, sniping know-it-all-ism.  People have just facts to make pseudo intelligent comments, and then play at it as if they are experts, would have had perfect foresight, etc.

I have worked with bio-statistics and epidemiological data for decades.  It's tough.  Analysis is usually behind and trying desperately to catch up.  The world cannot be as perfectly controlled and understood as many people think.  

Individual common sense has to play a role in keeping us all safe, and if you traveled in February, you weren't using any.

The rest of the probable infected residents may or may not have known they were that sick in January and February, so likely didn’t call their doctor or seek out medical help.

In January, Trump imposed our travel ban on travelers who had been in China during the prior 14 days.  But the faux ""humanitarians"" leading Europe and Canada REFUSED to impose similar travel bans.

The Europeans and Canadians welcomed travelers from China, including some who brought the infection to Europe and Canada.  Those China travelers infected Europe and then those infected European travelers were allowed to come to the US, bringing China's virus with them.

Trump failed to protect Americans when Canada and Europe refused to impose a travel ban similar to ours.  When they refused in January, Trump should have immediately closed our borders completely to all foreigners coming from anywhere."
2020-04-09 13:26:51,"Trump's China travel ban did not apply to Americans travelling between China and the US. I suggest someone starts looking at how that selective ban was nothing like as effective as Trump and his supporters are suggesting. I have read that up to 40,000 Americans travelled from China to the US in the weeks following the ban. It was Chinese that also led to the infection in S Germany and then Italy.. before they too were stopped. Yes, the virus in NY may well have been given a big boost by travellers from Europe.. how many of these were also Americans who had been in Europe and were encouraged to return home? Having said all this, banning flights was not necessary if the US had imposed proper checks and tests at the airports. Despite what Trump says about screening, my friends flying from Georgia to New Mexico the other day travelled without facing a single question, test or request for quarantine relating to Covid-19 and their health at either airport."

2020-04-09 13:19:00,"What, exactly, is the particular usefulness of this column when space in this newspaper is so precious -- at a time when the planet is on fire?

Of course most New York novel coronavirus cases came from Europe.  The biggest travel connection we have is with Europe.  U.S. travelers take more trips to Europe than China or anywhere else.  So they picked up the virus in Europe, or travelers from Europe brought the virus to the U.S.  

Covid-19 started in China, and like all coronaviruses, it mutates.  So this one mutated after reaching Europe from China.  It's called evolution.

The important news is that Covid-19 apparently hasn't been mutating that fast or in ways that otherwise would have made it a moving target for a vaccine."
2020-04-09 13:16:40,"The comments get at the 2nd reason the virus has been so anxiety-provoking: it showed us that our government can't (or chooses not to) protect us. This is not just a pandemic, it is a pandemic combined with a criminally negligent, corrupt presidency that has caused excess deaths. People have died because we didn't have enough tests, and because the CDC recommendations were wrong, because Trump and many Republican governors (mine) dealt with it by denial and bluster rather than taking constructive action.

A vote for Trump is a vote for someone who doesn't care if people live or die. My loudly Christian Republican governor is also in this camp. He also has no prior governing experience. This pandemic drives home the point that we would be far better off with atheist scientists in office, especially since we have global warming to deal with."

Here's a question that seems obvious: where & how did the infected folks in Europe from whom traveling New Yorkers unwittingly contracted the virus get infected?"

Life is not a movie and Tom Cruise can’t be deployed in seconds to shoot down the terrorist. Or capture someone carrying a virus to avert a pandemic. I can’t stand Trump, but it’s not because he dismantled the pandemic task force that this virus spread. It’s because we like to travel on airplanes and we are not as clean as we all assume. This study is interesting because it shows how interconnected our world is now so viruses can disperse worldwide pretty quickly. It’s science not politics so please keep out the reactionary conclusions."

China was locking down a city of 11 million and they built a facility to hospitalize a couple of thousand persons in ten days. That alone should have been like a call to arms as if incoming nuclear strikes were imminent. But, as with most things american, we as a nation can’t be bothered most of the time with such trivial matters in fact that’s why we have government institutions to do the worries for us. They failed along with most of our government. 

Let’s go back to the AIDS epidemic that began around 1981. Again, a Republican administration. Again, limited resources and little attention. After all, government was too big Reagan trumpeted. So millions died, and almost 40 years later were back with another republican administration and its the same story one more time. Can’t be bothered with that.

When will we as a nation learn that republicans are about money and themselves and we the people suffer when they are in charge of the federal institutions. Trump was born to fail. He gives off the illusion of success by plating it in gold."
2020-04-09 13:57:41,"The fact that the coronavirus was brought to the New York area primarily by travelers from Europe is very significant for two reasons.

It demonstrates that a world center like New York is particularly vulnerable to infectious diseases, which respect no boundaries or borders. If America wants to maintain New York as the financial and business capital of the world (and all Americans should want that), our political leadership in Washington should not be adopting a nickel-and-dime attitude about helping New York in this crisis.

The second important aspect of this finding of a European origin is that it removes the tiresome political point urged repeatedly by Donald Trump about stopping flights from China. Trump has botched everything in addressing the Covid-19 pandemic, so it is fitting that his bragging about the China flights be debunked also."
2020-04-09 14:00:11,"I understand how people believe it’s just because many European countries didn’t have travel ban. Travel ban sounds like such an easy solution. However I doubt if closing borders would have actually worked since the world is so connected these days and would you also ban the citizens from coming back home? 

A better example is Japan, which also didn’t ban travelers from China, is only a few hours flight from there, and has large population. Still Japan kept the cases low. I think the problem that shows here is not that simple as only a travel ban. It is time for us to rethink about our social system, how our governments react and also how we, the individuals react to this type of situation. Honestly it’s not just a shame on the politicians, but also a shame on many of us who didn’t do our own part of work."

Washington state, thanks to Governor Jay Inslee, got out in front of the disease with an early lockdown and it looks like we will now not outstrip our own healthcare system.  

A key component of this local success is owed to the person at the locally run Flu study who violated CDC orders and started testing their samples for COVID-19.  Without that we wouldn’t have learned about the degree of community spread early enough to realize what was happening and take action. 

The responsibility for the disaster that is currently occurring can be laid at the feet of the CDC and the administration.."

The Canadian government like most governments is under fire ours for not foreseeing what we were all watching unfold on TV and the internet and sending 16 tonnes of PPE to China on February 4, when we already had cases of the virus in Canada.  At the end of the day when all of this is over and the people around the world cry out for an independent inquiry of exactly why the WHO provided such bad advise I sincerely hope all leaders of all countries will also demand it.  Stay safe."
2020-04-09 14:07:14,"I still haven't heard a clear answer to why the US did not adopt the WHO tests. Was it just a judgment based on the two reagents versus three, the possibility of false negatives? Why didn't the US use the WHO tests until a CDC made test was tested and available? Was this a Made in America is always better decision? Most important, who made the decision? Because it is clear that delayed mass testing furthered the disaster and is still a problem.

While this article is beautifully and eloquently written, it saddens me to see that the author filled it with contradictions and erroneous conclusions.
Lets take the the first paragraph for example. The author attempts to empugn the Trump administration by stating ""New research indicates that the coronavirus began to circulate in the New York area by mid-February ...  and that travelers brought in the virus mainly from Europe, not Asia.""
The correct next statement would be something like ""The Trump administration was correct in banning travel from China early on. We only wish they were not eviscerated in the media for doing this. This criticism lead for a delay to their decision to ban the European travel"". 
This delay led to at least 15000 American deaths and a ruined economy (which will result in countless more death related to poverty, and despair. This time the young ones will die.
I lay this blame squarely on the shoulders of the journalism schools who did not require their graduates to posses strong critical thinking skills.

The spread of information about the virus trails far behind the virus itself. A small percentage of people who contract the virus present to a hospital, and they present weeks after the first infection. Add to this a reticence to admit to the world that you have a problem, and the virus may have been present for many weeks prior to December 31. The Wuhan international airport serves 20 million people per year.

I had two weeks of ""flu-like symptoms"" beginning 12-January, and it seems likely to have been COVID. Two days prior I was at an aerospace conference, spoke on a panel, and the panelist next to me showed symptoms. She had just been elected president of a large engineering society and had spent the conference being congratulated and shaking hands. (In January we still did this.) If she had COVID, her symptoms presented 6 days prior to the first “known” case of COVID. This at a conference of a few thousand people in Orlando.

My point is to counteract “availability bias”, the assumption that the virus originated based on what we know, and eliminate the possibility it originated from something that we don’t know. 

It seems possible, even likely, that the virus was present in the US prior to Christmas and New Year’s Holiday celebrations."

China lied, downplayed and tried to cover up Covid-19 when it first busted loose.  But it’s not China’s fault that Trump blew off briefings, canned the NSC pandemic response team, slashed the CDC budget, embraced conspiracy theories or ignored the lessons of his own Administration's 2019 ""Crimson Contagion"" exercise--which warned that the US was unprepared for a pandemic and had insufficient reserves of ventilators & PPE.  It's not China's fault that '2 months before the novel coronavirus is thought to have begun its deadly advance in Wuhan, the Trump administration ended a $200-million pandemic early-warning program aimed at training scientists in China and other countries to detect and respond to such a threat.'

He was never involved in any prior pandemic decision making nor had he ever been responsible for state and local resources in the event of a pandemic.

Bush warned Obama who warned Trump.  Both NYS Gov. Cuomo and former NYC Mayor Bloomberg were advised that they would be dramatically short of ventilators in the event of a pandemic.  Bloomberg in 2002 and Cuomo in 2015.

Trump is responsible for his actions as president, but he is not responsible for his predecessors' actions nor is he responsible for NYC and NYS's refusal to prepare."

2020-04-09 13:57:57,"We have a great deal more scientific capability and potential than we know what to do with. We cannot  stop all dangers, but we can forecast, predict, trace, create antidotes and mitigation, design and build new and better systems. Where there is a will there is a way.

Are we afraid to use it? Too lazy? Too comfortable? Too much in love with entertainment? Too foolish in following charlatans? With politicians and business leaders happy to use all of our weaknesses  for their power and wealth.

Covid19 has given us the chance to see that our world is upside down, mostly because of our upside down priorities. Let's get back to using the brains God gave us to preserve and tend the planet and human potential that God also gave us."
2020-04-09 13:59:20,"If someone only read this one article about Coronavirus and had no other knowledge of it, they would erroneously conclude that it independently originated in Europe.  

Only in one place does the author grudgingly acknowledge that the virus originated in China.  And even there, he misleadingly says ""the deepest branches of the tree all belong to lineages from China,"" as if the virus split off into a European variation centuries ago.  In fact, as the very next sentence points out, ""the virus probably first moved into humans from an animal host in late 2019.""

To summarize:  the virus first infected humans at the end of last year in China, and then slightly mutated when it arrived in Europe a few months ago.  We can assume the virus will keep slightly mutating, but the origin is always going to be China."
2020-04-09 14:07:03,"Good article! People need to be more data-driven and convinced more by science but not emotions, social media or propaganda.  That’s not easy to achieve since we are lazy humans, and it’s so much easier to be angry, biased and arbitrary than calm, objective and analytical."
2020-04-09 13:29:29,Are any scientists studying if different variants of this virus correlate with the severity off the illness ?
2020-04-09 13:50:10,"This can also be inferred by the fact that the first focus was in Washington (west coast), and NYC was the second focus (east coast), and the heartland (middle) seems to be the last and least affected part of the country.

That suggests the USA had two independent entrances to the virus: one from Asia (west coast) and one from Europe (east coast). NYC being the eastern focus, most cases must have come from Europe, not Asia."
2020-04-09 13:35:34,When Trump banned flights from Europe but continued to allow them from the UK it was effectively no ban at all.

2020-04-09 14:36:28,"Lots of comments today about how ""criminally negligent"" our government is in its failure -- perhaps even willful, according to some correspondents here -- to protect us.  The truth is far more complicated.  Having worked until recently for the executive branch for 45 years, I can share some insight. 

Innovation, creative thinking, and exploring issues outside the box are discouraged in our federal bureaucracy.  Group-think is the pandemic in the USG, and has been for decades.   Those who raise questions about existing policy are viewed as outliers and troublemakers.   And when intelligent people DO raise their voices, they are largely ignored. 

Add to that the fact that the traditional focus of our intelligence agencies and policymakers has been geopolitics and the military force structure of our enemies.  A new accent on terrorism was introduced following 9/11.  The US Army has long hosted an outstanding Medical Intelligence Unit, but few inside the civilian agencies of the USG pay any attention to its work.

Most appalling to me is the abject failure of the Directorate of National Intelligence -- created after 9/11 to prevent another catastrophe -- to alert our elected leadership to the potential enormity of this contagion. 

I know that it is tempting to blame everything on the deservedly vilified Mr. Trump.  But the fact is that he is the tip of an enormous dysfunctional USG iceberg -- one that has transcended multiple elected administrations over many decades."

“House Democrats continue to stand opposed to President Trump’s cruel, un-American travel ban in all of its iterations. In the coming weeks, the House Judiciary Committee will mark up and bring to the Floor the NO BAN Act to prohibit religious discrimination in our immigration system and limit the President’s ability to impose such biased and bigoted restrictions.""

On March 12, Trump said all travelers from Europe, except Americans and permanent U.S. residents, would be banned from entering the U.S. for the next 30 days.  This was based on Dr. Fauci's announcement that most new cases were coming from Europe.

Dr. Fauci believes that had Europe implemented travel restrictions as stringent at the US', it wouldn't have suffered as severe an outbreak."
2020-04-09 14:40:40,"One of first major US outbreaks started in Washington state from a traveler returning from China. NYC's out break came from Europe from cities frequented by Chinese tourists apparently. When Trump first proposed  cutting air travel from China he was roundly criticized, and again when he first suggested cutting European travel. 
 As with the 3 yrs of 'Russian collusion' the facts are being obfuscated by political narratives by those seeking political advantage...this time during a genuine crisis.

We knew that they were seniors, and most live in 55+ communities around here. Later, I’ve learned that there are thousands of Chinese workers who reside in Northern Italy who work in garment districts. They travel back to their home country, like for their New Year. So yeah, we New York metro area residents can make an assumption about where this came from."

We were in crowded theaters three times over 2 weeks in late February, subway rides to and from central Queens, eating out. I became sick, and wasn't sure if it was the flu as I'd had the senior shot for the second year in a row over summer. Had headaches, minor sore throat, but worse  I struggled to breathe over almost a week, couldn't even go up stairs without a struggle. I was about to call doctor when it subsided. We were in all the right places, as was my wife who worked in Flushing as well (now furloughed) then became sick but fought it off better over several days. Flu or not? We were oblivious, and earlier testing should have been made available as we can see much more now just what was going on."

Bottom line: Chinese Communism cares not for life in their quest for world domination. 
They have killed, murdered or starved hundreds of millions of their own people during their sordid existence. 
This toll that pandemic extracts (that was released by them) weighs not on their conscience. 
In fact, to be a true communist party member in China, being devoid of a conscience is likely a prerequisite."

How inconvenient, then, that this Times article shows that, by the time he had yet again indulged his obsession with closing the nation to anyone who does not resemble him, via his chosen people the virus had long since infiltrated the United States.  He and everyone in government who enabled him must go.

I read of the virus that started in Wuhan and had already spread to other parts of Asia in early January  and was concerned about attending the conference at the Javits Center with so many people coming from all parts of the world. I kept an eye on the Travel Show website to watch for any warnings or cancellations but didn't see any and felt I was being overly concerned.  As a travel professional I appreciate what I gain from the seminars and had already purchased tickets so I took a chance and went.     Fortunately, I had a mild case that cleared in a few weeks.    But for the future, I would expect the NY Times, of all institutions, to take proper precautions in light of life threatening pandemics when it sponsors events that draw from so many parts of the world.  I'm curious to know how many other attendees got sick.  The popular and crowded NYT Travel Show may very well have been ""patient zero"" for New York City.

2020-04-09 14:53:40,"For people who study international travel and migration, this article makes a lot of sense. 

One emerging consensus about the pandemic is that international tourists are not the major vectors of spread. Tourists typically do not have the density of social connections to be able to spread the virus since their contacts are limited to hotels, restaurants, and attractions. Much more likely source of infection are local residents who travelled abroad and are bring into the infection back home. These are the people who have social ties through places of worship, work, family, and community that become clusters.

Framed in this way, it makes sense that New York coronavirus has its origins from Europe. The number of people who have family, work, and lives between New York and Europe is very strong. More flights fly out of New York to European cities than to second-tier cities in the United States."

We were on Carnaby Street and it was absolutely mobbed with Chinese tourists (not being xenophobic, just mentioning) - we were all bumping into each other looking at the beautiful street decorations. We flew back to NYC on January 2nd feeling totally fine. Two days later my BF and I came down with symptoms that matched the virus. Horrible cough, fever, shortness of breath, etc. It was very scary. It knocked us out for over two weeks and neither of us recall ever being that sick in our entire lives. 
I have mentioned to doctor friends that I think we got it in London in early January. I have been greeted with eye rolls and skepticism for the most part.
Until the CDC (or whoever) rolls out an antibody test we'll never know who has really been exposed to this and when we can all get back to work. Maybe the US can get that test right this time around and rolled out to the general public quickly!"
2020-04-09 15:07:36,"I had a virus that started on MLK day (Jan 20) and the symptoms were 100% consistent with coronavirus, including chest pain/tightness, fever/chills, aches, headache, sore throat and dry cough. I missed four days of work (thankfully, I was able to rest and/or work from home to avoid infecting others). I went to urgent care on the third day of symptoms and was negative for flu. I recovered at home, returned to work a week after symptoms had onset and took about 2 weeks to feel fully recovered. I have long suspected I had an early case of the virus in NYC.

My question is, in the absence of testing, why weren't doctors, hospitals, urgent care centers, etc. tracking potential ""suspected"" cases back in January when news started emerging from China? There is already a well organized system in place for tracking flu around the city, it seems they should have started tracking cases in urgent care clinics, hospitals, etc. of cases with coronavirus symptons that tested negative for flu. Presumably there should have been a huge uptick starting late January into mid-February and if our local and state officials had that information they could have acted sooner."

This provides an important piece of the puzzle as to how the numbers have grown so large, so quickly, even with limited testing providing an incomplete picture. This also points to the need for an accurate, serological test for antibodies like the ELISA tests for HIV and Hep B, so we have a clear idea of who has been infected and is hopefully now immune. With some type of certification, these individuals may be able to renter the workforce, without jeopardizing the uninfected."
2020-04-09 15:13:15,"Very interesting reading, and rather reassuring.

What comes across to me, is that the initial travel ban appears to have been mostly xenophobic targeting, with little regard to how people travel the world.  The WHO's initial stance, highly criticized, wasn't far off - it's the testing component that was (and is) tragically lacking.

What also is apparent, is that coastal cities are always at the forefront for what is good and bad.  It's an ""ism"" that has been for the extent of human civilization."
2020-04-09 15:13:56,"Testing was and remains the problem. Unless we were to completely close our borders, which was not feasible, if for no other reason than allow citizens to return home.

And as long as we can’t tell who is or isn’t infected, as soon as it happens, we can’t go back to normal without risking additional exposure and infections.
Instead we wait for a vaccine or a cure that won’t overwhelm hospitals.

Yet this logical requirement continues to escape the Trump administration, costing lives and the economy."
2020-04-09 15:15:43,"The contagion from Europe to the US is an interesting topic, clearly.

More crucial is why the contagion within China itself has been contained.  Doesn't that defy what has been observed elsewhere?  Do the official numbers lie?  Wouldn't a geometric rise in deaths be impossible to hide?  Why does China report fewer cases than the US?  How or why has China's tally almost unchanged since late February?  Doesn't this issue merit some investigation?"
2020-04-09 15:24:14,"Well, if you believe this, you must believe in science.  

This is brilliant science, and so clearly explained.  Thank you for this article, Mr. Zimmer.

I expect that those without scientific training or education are unable to *fully* appreciate the depth and breadth this effort represents.  The rapid genomic analyses, extensive computational processing, and extraordinary electron microscopy all make this possible.  The powerful marriage of these technologies is relatively recent, and they reflect orders of magnitude of scientific advancement.  That scientists have been able to do such extensive and definitive research in such a short period of time is nothing less than stunning.  WOW!

Now if we can only transpose the insights and lessons of these efforts onto that pesky Climate Change topic..."
2020-04-09 15:24:52,"Milan Fashion Week was February 18-24. Paris Fashion Week followed February 24-March 3. A large group in New York City migrated en masse to Milan, then to Paris and returned to New York. 

If we're looking for an explanation, is this a significant gathering that could have seeded the virus in New York? There was a direct line from Lombardy to New York City, at a time when the virus was spreading undetected.

Studying this from a sociological perspective will be interesting  ...  looking at the impact of how we move in groups at set times. The ebbs and the flows of society."
2020-04-09 15:30:15,"The difficult thing is that even for those of us who knew and believed this was happening, there was little to do, because workplaces did not shut down. I still had to go into work and even interact directly with hundreds of the public each week up until the day my organization told us all to work from home, about 4 weeks ago. There was at least one month that it was clear this was happening, and even two weeks after community spread in NYC was 'confirmed,' that anyone with a job had to continue going in. And I believe during that time I and my colleagues were likely exposed, either by a colleague whose family had classic COVID symptoms-- even pneumonia-- or by the public (I work in a museum). What we need now is an antibody test that anyone in NYC can access. It's impossible to know at this point who has immunity, or if any one of the 'colds'/'bugs' I've had over the past two months, including last week, could've been it. Once we know who has immunity, we'll understand much better the situation we're in and be able to address it in a more targeted way."

Science is a great tool to teach by looking at data not by picking out ideas conforming to your underlying political ideology. 

Instead of blame we should be looking at how to prevent these dangerous virus particles from jumping among species or to establish a much faster system to warn us when they do to minimize the number of carriers.  Unfortunately the sources may be found among the most vulnerable populations on our planet compounding the difficulty.  This is not about China or Europe.  It is all of us."

The smart person realizes that we must ban Chinese arrivals to stem the potential for spreading in the US.

The genius realizes that people around the world have traveled to China and that we have to ban or severely restrict travel from other parts of the globe."

2020-04-09 15:04:01,I flew from NYC to Milan on February 15 and the Italians checked the temperature of everyone on the flight upon arrival. I flew back from Milan to NYC on Feb 22 (the day after the outbreak in Lombardy was officially announced) and there was no check whatsoever at Newark airport when we arrived. Thousands of people were flying from Milan to NYC that week and there was no health check whatsoever at immigration. Why do we have a Department of Homeland Security?

2020-04-09 15:03:51,"Tourists!!!  Particularly European tourists!!!

Those who know me have often heard me rail about all the tourists in NYC.  They are everywhere; always underfoot.  

On average, something like over a million tourists invade New York every week!  Or at least they did in the pre-Covid era.

They clog GCT taking selfies of themselves staring at the starry ceiling.  They walk back and forth to the Circle Line and Intrepid they block the Hudson River bike path that I so often ride on. They create a human traffic jam in TSQ, on Fifth Avenue and in the Museums.  They clog all the midtown eateries both fancy and not so fancy.

They are everywhere!

And now apparently they were, yes, a vector for Covid-19!

Yes, I know.  Tourists are a vital component of NYC's booming 21st C. economy.  Dozens of new hotels have been built to accommodate them.  The JFK and Newark airports were booming with flights to/from all over the world including, of course, Europe.

Oh, and then there is the particular traffic horror every October of UN Week!  Not just diplomats, but hangers on, journalists.  The whole nine yards of tourists!

Yes, it's tourists!  They are the culprits.  Not the wet markets of Wuhan or the like.

No, it's those well-off travelers anxious to see in person the storied sights of New York.

Now me?  I too have been known to visit other places.  But me?  I'm never a ""tourist"".  When I visit places I'm a ""traveler"".

Whew!"

Obviously, intervening events put the kibosh on that trip.

Simply a matter of lucky timing, I guess.  Otherwise we might have been exposed there and then brought it back to NYC ourselves.

Another bullet dodged (I hope)."

We were in Croatia and in a park and a Chinese tour group was near us.  While my husband and I were standing close to each other, looking at the view, a Chinese woman came in pushed her head between us.  As Westerners we would consider that rude.  Different cultures.  I am guessing COVID-19 got to Europe via China & Chinese tourists."

Regardless of its source, coronavirus has ripped through the US with devastating speed due to a disastrous lack of response by Trump and the federal government.  With Trump in control, we remain largely unprotected should this virus mutate.  Science is of no avail if it is ignored and/or distorted by those charged with implementing testing and quarantine measures.  Regardless of its source, our isolation and the resulting economic harm are a direct result of Donald Trump and the republican party's initial and continuing failures."

Of course, there is also Chinese tourism, which has exploded across Europe in recent years, as anyone visiting Italy, France, and even Russia will be able to attest."
2020-04-09 16:03:16,"I commend @nytimes for covering this evolving data set of single mutations on the Sar-Cov-2 genome.  This will eventually enable us to trace how the infection spread across the globe. The virus is very likely to have originally come from bats in China. Though, I am curious where it has resided recently since the data suggest that this virus diverge from the bats decades ago.  Our recent advance in technology for reading genomes will enable us to hunt down the source and potential intermediate hosts.  I look forward to time when we know the full story which will enable us to figure out proper counter measures to prevent future pandemics."
2020-04-09 16:05:16,"New York had plenty of warning, whatever the provenance of the virus. Chicago had its first case, number two in the country, January 24th and the first traced person-to-person transmission six days later, causing the CDC and HHS to declare a national public health emergency that same day. The Chinese travel ban was already in the works even before this and some airlines were already restricting flights. I think it is safe to say that if by January 25th Washington, Illinois, California, and Arizona are reporting cases that NYC was already rife with the virus. Should we have simply locked down the country as of February 1st and rolled out testing while at the same time instituting closures and cancellations and enforcing social distancing? This is what we will need to figure out going forward as we wait for an even nastier and far more fatal virus to jump from a horseshoe bat to a human, whether Chinese, European, or other."
2020-04-09 16:07:50,"This study suggests the possibility that the virus in the NY area, from Europe, could have undergone mutations making it behave differently from the virus circulating on the west coast. Hopefully genomic assays will be done on cases in LA and Washington state which most probably derive from Asia. If the mutated virus hypothesis holds up we could be dealing with a virus that mutated in such a way that there is a difference in virulence.  This certainly could explain the difference in cases and deaths we see in the Tri State area versus the west coast."

Near the end you stated:
“Mutations do not automatically turn viruses into new, fearsome strains. They often don’t bring about any change at all. “To me, mutations are inevitable and kind of boring,” Dr. Bell said. “But in the movies, you get the X-Men.”  “

Then the second last para:

“As hard as the fight against it may be, its mutations reveal that things can be a whole lot worse.”

So, a) that last comment was an unnecessary fear provoker, and b) I didn’t see any thing in the article that spoke to how mutations reveal things could be worse.

1. It didn't work, and it only targeted non-citizens. Thousands traveled back from China and obviously imported the virus with them. 

2. Now we know the virus was primarily spread from Europe

3. No Trump defender identifies those accusing ""liberals"" It is just more pro-Trump hype from Faux News.

4. Trump's real racist move was to identify the virus as ""The Chinese virus"" setting his ""base"" off attacking Asian-Americans, even Koreans, Japanese, Vietnamese and Hmong.

Seriously.  Look at how clearly the departures for the US from Europe reflect Trump's choice to keep the UK open...They now have the worst spread in Europe.

More plebeian detective work is /was needed to track the infected travelers and their contacts.  Neither was done as soon as the threat was known.

For those obsessed with China - it isn't the only source of new( to humans) viral material, and spending time on trying to affix blame is useless. The US also completely failed to respond prudently and quickly, and this was inlarge part do the The President's lack of broad knowledge, and interference with the people who understood the threat.  And to his refusal to listen to briefings on the growing danger. Xi and China - were wrong to resort to denial -- but Trump resorted to the same denial. 

Trump has continually moved the US away from cooperation with other nations - -  and in the case of a pandemic - this is definitely cutting your nose to spite your face. Or maybe slicing off his nose to spite the country.

The testing was absolutely necessary,  And it wasn't done - and even now, there is not wide access.

Trump's emphasis on cutting off travel from China filled his political need. However, in this age, with people traveling widely  for business and leisure, real airport screening was needed  as soon as the threat was reported.  Not just a question about travel to China. I.e., in January.

In Hong Kong during January and early February, I saw many European tourists not wearing masks. My guess was because they were becoming difficult to get. But were they following recommendations not to wear them? 
Maybe less potentially politicizing this issue: What happened in Covid cases where one person was infected, but no one else around them, immediate family, coworkers, etc..were infected? What went right? There's a much larger story to be learned and told about masks. How effective are they? How effective are the DIY masks? Are there any studies from Asia where people have long worn masks? (My earliest memory is 2003 China SARS), Japanese have worn masks since 1918.

First the reaction was that the ban was ""racist"" and ""xenophobic"" and shouldn't have been implemented. Then the reaction was that travel bans are useless--""viruses don't respect borders,"" we were told. That was always a bit of nonsense; viruses are carried by people, and people can be stopped by borders. And now--given that nearly every country in the world has implemented travel bans in response to COVID-19--the Democrats have drifted to the position that Trump's travel ban wasn't strict enough, and should have been implemented earlier."

If that were not true then China originating strain infections would likely have equal or more COVID-19 cases. Unfortunately the COVID-19 cases in Europe did not become significant and reported until the first week in March which means that COVID-19 infected people from Europe to the US came in great numbers before the COVID-19 threat from Europe was identified.

2020-04-09 16:47:22,"Note that when the article says that a heavy testing program could've detected these cases, it would have had to have been a very heavy testing program indeed. Until the 21st of February, Italy had a total of three confirmed cases. There was no more reason to test people who'd traveled from there in the middle of February than travelers from anywhere else, and barely any reason to test them over any other random person. (Other than the fact that Europe hadn't banned travel from China in the aggressive way that the US did.)"
2020-04-09 16:52:23,"And again, it all comes back to testing. Should have started earlier, and we still aren’t doing what we need. Look at Iceland, we know nothing until we start testing mass populations. The majority of infected are advised to stay home and quarantine without getting a test (each test uses valuable PPE). We’re fumbling around in the dark."
2020-04-09 17:01:03,"So Trump is wrong - again! I mean about the ' China virus "". It gives me a flicker of hope that the corona virus will mutate to it's own death. Perhaps vaccines maybe the answer to the virus because the parent genome is the same. Only like the influenza vaccine. There are new cases of influenza every year in spite of vaccinations. Because each year there are new strains. Maybe so for Corona too. We may have attenuated signs and symptoms. That could be the new normal."
2020-04-09 17:02:33,"Mr Zimmer, I don't think that where the virus originated is so critical to know, for the Times to be reporting results which have not been peer reviewed.  I am not impugning these investigators at all (and I am not an expert in this field) but making this NEWS at this point going to be taken as non-nuanced fact by the public, even though it is not actionable information."
2020-04-09 17:03:22,"""Mutations do not automatically turn viruses into new, fearsome strains. They often don’t bring about any change at all. “To me, mutations are inevitable and kind of boring,” Dr. Bell said.

A mutation is boring?
A mutation is how the virus jumped from bats to humans. A mutation is how SARS CoV 1 (2002-03) became the more virulent SARS CoV 2. A viral mutation can become more infectious as it spreads, and less lethal. I don't think they know. The course of a mutation like the process of nature selection is random, and not easily predictable."
2020-04-09 16:19:37,"Of course China does not want to take ownership of the virus origins. This is understandable. Where they are at the center of it is in the idea of herd immunity. If there is a herd immunity effect in vaccinations as is clear, then there is a herd infection for a virus to spread in a country with 1.3 Billion people and that number is even with their attempts at population control with the one child policy. Where the virus may have been able to freely travel and infect others is in what the experts are talking about now, asymptomatic carriers yet unaffected peoples still able to pass it on to others. Population density causes more intense outbreaks of  disease, especially viruses like Measles which erupt when groups like the outbreak among the Orthodox Jews of Upstate NY and Brooklyn NYC who would not be vaccinated. Our own behavior works against us many times. It is clear that lower population states have lower incidence of this virus. In Nevada, we have 2500 total cases and 81 deaths as of yesterday. Though this low population state is large the most cases, about 1800 are in the most populated county of Clark County where many residents are. Viruses are always among us. It is interesting to know how they do that exactly. Thank goodness whatever has not been decimated by this no nothing President set to cut all funding where we need it the most. Lets not forget the L'Oreal Company headquartered in McConnell Kentucky got a GRANT, to study Sunscreen from the most recent bill."
2020-04-09 17:04:55,"My spouse, a nurse employed in a major hospital, has had 2 bouts of the virus about 6 weeks apart. The second time they were tested and received a positive diagnosis. 

They were VERY ill both times - and can't go back to the front lines because a third time seems as if it would be fatal.

Understand fever is not always a symptom nor is a dry cough -  expanding symptoms are: chills, night sweats, loss of smell, extreme exhaustion, body aches. 

Be safe be well."
2020-04-09 17:08:24,At low levels of infection researchers can combine individual samples in a pooled test and then retest individuals from those positive pooled samples to find the individual positive.  Mass testings for either active or prior infection are doable and the only way forward.  You can see why investors are trying to buy entrepreneurs that have viable tests.

It takes a group of incompetent , ignorant sycophants to create such a debacle. Trump is the symptom, not the problem. He’s accountable for the reckless dysfunction, but he needs help from his weak, brain washed, pathetic minions. We have November to fix this."

2020-04-09 16:36:44,"All infections are descended from the initial Wuhan virus whether or not they went first from China to Europe.  

In my opinion the CCP clearly owns this for negligently continuing wet markets that facilitate cross species virus tranmission even after such markets originated SARS, then wrongly and illegally covering it up, giving the impression it may not spread human to human, and I believe understating the death rate.

The rest if the world may have had an imperfect response, but it is a response to a Pandemic that never should have happened.

When China punishes those who sounded the alarm which saved lives, it is in my opinion clearly acting evilly. 


If wet markets exist how about farm raised rather than wild animals.  How about cleanly segregating species so that diseases will not spread among them and people.

I can forgive the negligence of allowing such markets.  I can not forgive knowingly covering it up and more specifically punishing those who tried to save lives by sounding the alarm.

Thank you to Dr. Ai Fen for her sacrifice.  I understand it is widely reported she disappeared after an interview explaining the reaction of her superiors to the whistle blowing.  You selflessly served the Chinese people, and the world in general.

How can people disappear in a developed country."
2020-04-09 16:40:10,"Everyone has said that COVID-19 originated from a specific type of bat in China; and, somehow, that Virus got mutated and allowed to infect the human species respiratory system. 
Now the new discoveries are disturbing! The COVID-19 ancestral genomes of all New York patients are European.  That raises questions. COVID-19 arises from  anywhere in the World.  
An analogy for the layman is that the pyramids were built in Egypt,  in the Middle East,  in Central America,  in South America  by civilizations so far away. Another analogy is the origin of the human species. Before, everyone believe that we are descendants of Adam and Eve. Darwin  created an uproar in the 19th Century by speculating that the human species was a series of mutations from apes in Africa.  Contemporary archaeologists discovered that modern man share many anatomy characteristics with the Neanderthal man, the Cro Magnon man, the China man.
Nature has its deep Mystery. I must say."
2020-04-09 16:18:38,"I have seen countless comments, including in these pages, over the last several weeks by people eager to blame the Chinese for the outbreak in New York.  Now we find out that, in fact, Europe was the bigger problem for New York all along.  And once again, racism is revealed."
2020-04-09 16:20:28,"So the one thing Trump did that was actually good, closing the border to China, didn't help much.   And not doing anything else for two months has caused numerous extra deaths.  Thanks republicans!"
2020-04-09 16:21:15,"The NYTimes and other news organizations should explain to the people and to the President that Trump's move to block travel from China was insufficient.  

The media should explain to the people and to the President the value of separating travelers arriving at passport control and screening them with a thermometer and a questionnaire as was done in other countries.

The NYTimes and other media should attempt to quantify in morbidity and mortality the failure to take these actions and present them to the people. 

The NYTimes must counter Trump's inaccurate rambling with facts even if they are very disturbing."
2020-04-09 16:26:55,"This is why there is little trust in the media.  You sensationalize the article with ""Most New York Coronavirus Cases Came From Europe"" which the casual reader might infer, and probably NYT's intent, that the travel ban against China was racist/not needed or poorly conceived.  However,  deep within the comments section, the columnist says ""Ultimately this virus originated in China”."

No doubt this started with China. Purely subtle partisanship reporting.

I'll keep my fingers crossed the Americans will soon have the epidemic behind them. Stay safe!"
2020-04-09 16:25:12,"Key take-home message is: once a highly infectious disease is making its rounds, it'll likely arrive here, too. If not directly from its country of origin, then by way of others.  Not a question of if or where from, but when.  That's why we had teams from the CDC scout out what might be next before the Trump administration decided to get rid of them to ""save money and shrink government"".  Similarly, the NSC had personal to prepare for something like Covid, but Trump got rid of those teams, too.  Now he's blaming everyone else but himself for his screwups."
2020-04-09 16:37:43,The great majority of Coronavirus in New York area was likely transmitted through Europe. The US cut of the Pacific route. The virus went China to Europe to US. When Trump shut down the Pacific route he probably should have also shut down the European routes. A tough call that given the outcry over the China shut down was not politically feasible. Good arti
2020-04-09 16:13:02,"So much for the president's assertions that ""I closed it down"" when he first started limiting flights from China."
2020-04-09 16:23:59,"This interesting. I understand that the virus ORIGINATED from China, and I've always thought it was brought to NYC from there knowing that there is a large population of East Asians in the city and business travelers coming and going from China/East Asia. It makes so much sense though that the virus that created an outbreak in NYC actually was brought from Europe since I'm sure there's much more traffic in and out between NYC and Europe. I was in NYC on Feb 5th and 12th, and I was pretty sure if the virus, which at that time was wreaking havoc in Wuhan already, got to the city it was going to be bad. It was a bit surreal to see that people were just going about their own affairs so complacently. Had they closed international traffic into the US in February, which I understand would have been costly and criticized by many, the national pandemic wouldn't have been this bad."
2020-04-09 16:26:18,"No.  They came from China, which has effectively invaded Europe. Then, from Europe, they crossed the pond to NY."
2020-04-09 17:27:10,"It would be interesting to test the virus that is rampant in Eagle County, Colorado.  I was skiing there in early March.  There were people there from all over the world.
      Though I have unused days remaining on my ski pass I am thankful that Vail and Beaver Creek totally shut down and saved me from infection.  It probably helped that I was able to drive home and avoid crowded planes and airports."
2020-04-09 17:30:44,"Many have mentioned it.  So many folks (not just in NYC) were inexplicably sick for weeks, in early to mid-February.  A colleague had flu-like symptoms for 3 weeks, despite a flu vaccine, and being tested for various flu strains, none of which she had. My brother and his son were also sick for weeks (in NYC); I went to a mid-February birthday party for him and his kids (all born the same month) and the topic of conversation was how folks there had or knew someone who was wicked sick in the weeks before.  I had more colleagues (in a company of thousands) out sick in late January and February than now."
2020-04-09 17:30:45,"To simplify the NYC strain is the Chinese Covid-19 via Europe. We all know that the New Rochelle outbreak traces back to a person recently returning from Italy. Then retrace that person's journey back to the airport, and everyone that was socially exposed, then to the airplane which probably served as a Petrie dish during the flight."
2020-04-09 17:32:28,The virus originated in China.  It came to NYC through  individuals who had either been in China themselves or had contact with others who had been in China.  I don’t see the relevance of where the initially contagious stopped along the way to the US.  I do get that there is enormous pressure to stop “blaming” the Chinese but the facts are the facts.

2020-04-09 12:18:11,"This article makes me wonder even more if I was infected with coronavirus in NYC in mid-January. I attended a conference and sat with a Californian who coughed horribly the entire day. Several days later, I came down with the worst virus of my life. I was sure I had pneumonia (which I’ve had before). Doc said no; just a “bad virus” of unknown origin. It’s 3 months later and I’m JUST NOW tapering off the endless cough. I can’t get tested because there isn’t an antibody test yet and I’m no longer sick. I’d like to see a study of when the virus started circulating in Seattle and CA. Just one person on one plane is all it takes. If I knew I’d had it, I could safely help others instead of being sequestered at home."
2020-04-09 17:29:01,"Great article.

My thoughts go back to the 2014-2016 Ebola epidemic, in which 11 people were treated in the US. Meaning an aggressive virus like Ebola that literally takes no prisoners and isn't as stealthy as COVID-19 or HIV in its transmission managed to get to the US.

Since then there was a National Security Council's playbook on dealing with pandemics created, that outlines some of the steps the president can and should take as preemptive or reactive measures. You can google and read it.

Why did the Trump administration not prepare since the Ebola crisis that took place, like proper screening already tested and in place at airports to test for the diseases that were known? Or having enough PPE or test kits that could be modified/upgraded by now if they had been setup 3 years ago?

There are annual Worldwide Threat Assessments prepared and presented for the president. So I'm wondering then is this an exercise in MS PowerPoint or do government officials and presidents actually read and understand what is being shared?"
2020-04-09 17:42:48,"""While conspiracy theories might falsely claim the virus was concocted in a lab, the virus’s genome makes clear that it arose in bats.""

That is not the claim. No one is disputing that the virus's genome shows that it came from bats. The claim that so-called conspiracy theorists are making is that the virus, which came from bats, was being stored in the lab in Wuhan and that something went wrong in the lab, which led to its dispersal among the population. This claim is based on translations of job descriptions posted on the lab's website in 2019 which request scientists to work with a new coronavirus, and the disappearance of one of the lab's researchers."
2020-04-09 17:43:50,New York Schools had winter break in late February.  So many people travel to Europe for winter break.  This unfortunate timing of the break must have contributed to the influx of cases relative to the rest of the US.  Italy went on lock down two weeks after the break.
2020-04-09 17:44:28,"The same was true of 1918 Spanish Flu Pandemic brought to NYC& other states from Europe.  Cruise ships were an issue then as now in adding to spread. Asian traveling from Wuhan did start in Seattle/Washington. 

Something has to be done after this devastating pandemic regarding international effort to address pandemics. An especially aggressive, timely, & united response from all European & Asian countries.  Asian countries, particularly China, must do something about better health & safety standards and getting rid of zoology food/medicine business.  

We need to get our critical supplies manufacturing out of Asian countries and Europe. We need it back in the U.S. or Canada where we can easily access it and control supply & distribution better.  Need to ensure every state/military fully stocked and rotate supplies. 

We need to focus on a more healthy and less obese America and more income equality. You can't have 10% of the country in control of 90% of the income.  People need to take more responsibility for their personal health as well."
2020-04-09 17:49:37,"The US fed government including the CDC headed by a political appointee was not an efficient force against the pandemic. Surely it was a predictable event among the science crowd around the world. Unfortunately it is the Mar a Lago crowd running and over ruling things. Thanks for this article shedding light on the nuts and bolts of viral detection and the necessity of surveillance through testing. It always comes back to testing.

In America's case, the lack of early testing and limited testing has made us the epicenter of the world. Now the Mar a Lago's are planning a great comeback for the economy by May 1st! The experts which stand behind Trump have been tolerated long enough. No mention of testing. No focus on surveillance. The first wave hit us undetected from Europe at a time we had a partial but inefficient lockdown from China! The US comeback could really be a comeback for the virus. How can there be consumer confidence without adequate testing and data?"
2020-04-09 17:50:49,"I work at Temple University in Rome. On February 29th, after the CDC raised the alarm level to a 3, all of our 300+ students were instructed to go back to the US immediately and that our school would be closed for the rest of the semester and we would operate remotely. All of the Study Abroad programs in Italy eventually followed suit that week with thousands of students flying back in hoards to major US airports. My students all reported that they were not monitored for fever or symptoms or even questioned when they arrived. A few conscientious students self-monitored and went into quarantine for two weeks, but the majority did not. When I heard this, I suspected that shortly after, there would be a major outbreak in the U.S. A lot of the contagion could have been avoided by screening. If we here were able to put 2+2 together, I can't believe that the CDC and the Federal government were not aware of this danger."

""Mariners returning to Europe in 1346 brough back tales of a deadly plague that left thousands of corpses piles up in cities throughout China and India. 

The next year the news came in a more ghastly form, as trading ships sailed into European ports with virtually all their crew dead or dying of the plague. 

Tradesmen infected with the bubonic plague spread the disease to Sicily, and from there to North Africa and to southern Italy. Within months all of Europe was consumed by the plague... 

[...] 

As the plague spread from country to country, it devastated whole populations. By 1348 millions were dying in England, France, Germany and Austria. ... Half the population of Florence perished within six months. 

[...] 

All efforts to understand the causes of the plague or stop its spread failed miserably. 

[...] 

When the plague finally abated in 1351, an estimated twenty-five million people had died in Europe. About one-third of the world's population had succumbed. 

No one was spared; not royalty or nobles, church officials or whole friaries, artisans or patrons of the arts... 

It was the most devastating disaster ever visited upon the world...""

2020-04-09 18:14:46,"Believe it or not, I actually had someone tell me recently that testing was bad because all it did was scare people who found out they had coronavirus and fuel the call for more regulations.   Testing provides invaluable information. This article presents just some of the testing. Not only will testing for active COVID and antibodies help us figure out who (once they are healthy) will hopefully have enough immunity to go back to school/work, testing provides data that helps scientists figure out what is happening so that we can provide good information for decision makers (how they use that information is another thing). If harvesting antibodies is found to be a helpful way of treating COVID patients, then we will need a data bank of people who have antibodies.  I hope people won't listen to the anti-science media folk who say that testing is bad for society.  Testing, including genetic analyses, etc. is crucial.  Thanks for publishing one more article demonstrating how and why it can be useful."

2020-04-09 18:18:35,"Far more relevant to our health than the provenance of New York's Covid 19 cases (though that is interesting) is to focus on what the world will do about wet markets (or dry ones) where viruses carried by imported wildlife (and domestic animals) have triggered pandemics before and will do so again. The markets must be eradicated, or at the very least, far better regulated, on a case by case basis.  At the same time governments must work together to provide healthy protein and livelihoods to those who depend on the markets. Everything on this planet is interconnected and if we don’t see it and accept that now… Let conservation biologists and other scientists be consulted to help governments come up with plans for action."
2020-04-09 18:21:19,"Washington and California were probably unlikely beneficiaries of this phenomenon.  Looking at the stats, those two states received the lion's share of scarce CDC testing resources in the early days of this crisis because the CDC was pre-screening only patients that had recently come from China.  The CDC's early testing screwups and associated China-centric screening obscured NYC/NJ's cases, while raising the alerts on the West Coast."

It is important to remember that a large number of respiratory viruses give symptoms identical to Covid19. Indeed, even now with relatively widespread Covid19 infections, 80% of the tests are negative. A few are certainly false negatives, but PCR is very good at detecting things. This shows how difficult (impossible?) it is to diagnose Covid19 just based on symptoms."
2020-04-09 18:35:57,"Carl,

I’m a geneticist so I understand the facts in the article. Thank you. 

My question is: if this virus was circulating for many weeks before testing revealed it, why are we just recently seeing large numbers of hospitalizations with critically ill patients? Wouldn’t these severe illnesses have become evident much sooner-or, were people with severe respiratory illness who died just not recognized as being infected with Covid-19?"

While I never thought Covid-19 was man-made or some sort of bio-weapon, I have wondered if the all-natural, deadly virus unintentionally escaped from Wuhan's Bio- Lab. I'm assuming researchers work with natural pathogens as well?"
2020-04-09 18:40:47,"The coronavirus started in Wuhan, China.  The New York cases may have come from Europe but the European cases came from the Chinese travelers.  They are or were traveling widely throughout Europe and spread it there among the Europeans.  I have found more Chinese people traveling than Americans when I have been there on vacation.  President Trump did the right thing to close the borders to China.  It was also wise for the European countries to close their borders too to China and other countries.  It is a good thing also that we finally closed our borders to the Europeans.  

We should not reopen our borders until this pandemic passes.  I was supposed to travel to Dubai but cancelled due to this epidemic.  I will definitely reschedule but not until this virus passes.  It may be a while but it should pass."
2020-04-09 18:42:18,"I think this is an intriguing article, and provides a lot of interesting data on the origin and development of the pandemic. Thank you for sharing it.

Having said that, there are ethical implications for such data. I'm a bit alarmed to see the content of this article being used as a rationale to 'blame' certain nationals or people engaged in certain activities  for the spread of the virus.

Likewise, there are comments here that reflect the distress of people who've checked the timelines with their own schedules and health and concluded with alarm that they were spreading the virus.

It's wrong for people to think that. No one knew and most likely would've changed their behavior had they known what was happening.  Hindsight is 20/20.

I hope the knowledge can be taken in a more positive direction about public health and hygiene moving forward. I think there's an older mentality about 'toughing things out' ie going to work/school/conferences  while we're sick.

Hopefully we'll become more community minded about those choices moving forward. 

 Of course, this will inevitably lead to conversations about healthcare and the safety net, but that's another topic.

 Hopefully moving forward"
2020-04-09 18:48:54,"There are many, however, who theorize that a lab in Wuhan may have indeed been involved - not in CREATING the virus but in (probably accidentally) RELEASING it, rather than the animal from a wet market theory. There apparently are a couple high level government virology labs in Wuhan, one some 300 yards or so from the much-maligned wet market to which many early cases have been traced. So, the headline would read ""Coronavirus Outbreak Begins 300 Yards from Lab Studying Coronaviruses."" Seems possible."
2020-04-09 19:13:30,"It was three whole weeks before China informed the Chinese people that there was the coronavirus.  During this time Chinese people continued traveling and large crowds mingled.  The Chinese travel extensively to Europe and brought the virus with them.  In turn, Europeans traveled to New York, a very popular tourist destination and brought the epidemic with them.  It was very smart of President Trump to close the border with China when he did and shortly after with Europe.  If he had not, we would be seeing many thousands more cases and deaths."
2020-04-09 19:56:01,"Several pertinent points. Some 400,000 people traveled to the United States from China after January 1 but before the travel restrictions were put in place. The China travel restriction was too late to make any difference--other than how it played to the bigotry that the Trump base laps up. If there is no evidence that the virus was circulating here before January 1, an unknown number among that 400,000 brought one or more genetic strains to the United States. Though there were exchanges between the East and West coasts, we may hypothesize that, for instance, our Seattle strains principally came directly from China, and the New York strains came principally from Europe (but mainly not Italy, interestingly). There are interesting parallels. For example, our Seattle rats are of the variety found in Eastern Russia and Eastern China, whereas the New York rats are have a European origin. For modelers of the pandemic, it does make a difference how many folks out of that 400,000 brought the virus here to, for example, Seattle. One pertinent number is how many uninfected folks each infected person passes the virus to. That number can be smaller if the number of folks who brought the virus here is larger. Those models will generally try to calibrate their models with current case and death counts."
2020-04-09 19:57:25,"Naturally this is true.  

After all travel from China was banned well before the NY breakout. 

The deeper question is did those who brought it here from Europe catch it from those traveling from China to Europe. 

Regardless, it started in China and spread globally.  That is a fact and it does not aid us in our current efforts."

2020-04-09 19:47:48,"We were in the southwest on New Year's Eve, and I didn't even want to eat out at a Thai restaurant, as China let us know on that day, that a very contagious, and deadly disease was circulating in Wuhan, and Hubei province.  Our Chinese friend's parents, who live in the Twin Cities with them, immediately stopped going to the Chinese Senior Center, Asian grocery stores, Chinese New Year festivities, and seeing their friends.  Two physicists, and two computer tech people, they have stayed in their house since the early part of January.  They knew that if the Chinese government had lied about what was happening initially, that it was something that should be taken very seriously.  They also had digital contact with people in Wuhan.  There are a lot of Asians, and Chinese who have lived in the Twin Cities for over 5 decades, working, going to school, becoming citizens, visiting family, and traveling abroad as well back to China.  Wuhan was, and is a very important Chinese city for manufacturing of many products, and a large auto assembly plant for 4 car makers, as well.  Now, the fact that there appears to have been a possibility that the virus might of been circulating in the United States in December as well, it shows that we haven't gotten to the bottom of it yet."

I see America laboring beneath not one, but two diseases.  The first is Covid-19, which is terrible, has cost many lives, and will cost more before all is said and done.  The second is disinformation.  The first is the subject of conspiracy theories.  The second is an actual conspiracy against the American people by all those 'news' outlets that prefer hyperbole and outrage to facts.  Some of the conspirators are unknowing dupes.  Many of them are unprincipled provocateurs who see disinformation and outrage as the foundation of their political clout and financial benefit.  

I am grateful that there are writers of truth and conveyors of facts out there to work as the antigen to the worst  of the two diseases.  I say 'worst' because it is only by knowing the truth and acting on it that we can hope to put Covid-19 behind us.

2020-04-09 16:48:50,"Whether or not it is politically incorrect to call it a ""Chinese Virus"", it is clear that the virus originated in China.

Whether or not most of the New York cases were ""seeded"" in New York by traveled from Europe, Europe obviously was merely a way point on the road form China -- i.e. the virus came to Europe from China. It clearly did not originate in Europe.

As the NYT story itself says,

""While conspiracy theories might falsely claim the virus was concocted in a lab, the virus’s genome makes clear that it arose in bats.
There are many kinds of coronaviruses, which infect both humans and animals. Dr. Boni and his colleagues found that the genome of the new virus contains a number of mutations in common with strains of coronaviruses that infect bats.
The most closely related coronavirus is in a Chinese horseshoe bat, the researchers found. But the new virus has gained some unique mutations since splitting off from that bat virus decades ago.""
""The deepest branches of the tree all belong to lineages from China.""

The facts cited by the story itself clearly does not absolve China.

Clearly, Europe was negligent in its stance toward China.

Clearly, other Asian countries -- South Korea, Japan and Thailand -- were far more vigilant and prompt than Europe in their response to the threat from China. Those countries -- South Korea, Japan and Thailand -- did not hesitate to impose very strong measures -- and did not yield either to wishful thinking -- nor to political correctness."

After reading the NYT article from few days back on why death rates in Germany was so low, it was easy to see Trump wasn't the only one who bungled the response. All our pharmaceutical companies, research labs and universities failed us as well. They were ready with testing before the first person was identified, we still don't have enough.

Chinese love leather.
Historically, it has always been a luxury in China.
During the past two decades, as China emerged as a major economic power, Chinese have rewarded themselves for their hard work by looking overseas for leather.
Italians (especially in Northern Italy) have a long history and tradition of skilled work in leather goods of all kinds -- from shoes to handbags.
In recent years, China directed billions of dollars to investing in Italian (especially northern Italian) leather enterprises.
Along with their investment, in recent years, Chinese have sent tens of thousands of Chinese workers to Italy (especially northern Italy) to work in their newly acquired Italian leather enterprises.
So, Italy was the first European victim of the Chinese zoonotic bat virus evolved in the live animal markets so prevalent in China.

According to the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, 33 out of 585 samples collected from the Huanan Seafood market shows the presence of coronavirus. No further public announcement was made since the finding was shared on Jan 27. In a study published by Global Biosecurity, samples tested positive from the market were not in the wild animal section, but in the seafood section. Based on phylogeny, the virus is not from seafood or fish. Furthermore, the first exposure among confirmed cases at the seafood market in Wuhan was reported on December 1, 2019. The index case did not have exposure to the seafood market. The first cases may have occurred around December 8, 2019. The 70-year-old patient suffered from cerebral infarction had been homebound for years, according to Dr. Wu Wenjuan, director of the ICU at Jinyintan Hospital.

The facts also tell us that while Trump did bar ""foreign nationals"" from China from entering the US, hundreds of American nationals who had been in China and possibly exposed to the virus were allowed to return without quarantine.

So why the emphasis on China as the source? China as the country that failed to warn the world? China as the false favorite of the WHO? 

The answer is complicated. But ever since Obama's ""Asian pivot"" it has been US policy to confront and contain Chinese economic growth.

The issues are economic because China's military is deployed as a home defense force. In contrast, our military is deployed as an international first strike force that now has troops or bases in 140 countries.

To carry out this policy of confrontation and containment the US has to first convince the American people that China is an adversary and very soon may be an enemy.

We are not given any reasons for this policy, but every agency in the government is on board with the incessant drumbeat denigrating China.

This virus has emphasized the importance and necessity for international cooperation. Yet US policy continues down the path of domination and subordination.

Climate change, clean water availability, biodegradation, plastic pollution, etc.: these challenges require the kind of collaboration we are witnessing now to solve, not the siloed approach we have been seeing."

Working together in this way, is part of what the Founders, men of the Enlightenment, meant by 'government providing for the general welfare.' They didn't put the words vaccine (which they knew) or ventilator (which they didn't) in the Constitution, they assumed we'd figure it out.

Retreating into a faith based politics - which puts untested assertions of belief over reasoned analysis of empirical evidence - is in this crisis forcing scientists to work double time. They must mitigate the dangers of a novel virus and of a blinkered and hide bound administration. 

Our bad political choices, are forcing scientists to waste time and effort preventing an all powerful executive, unmoored from reality and effectively unaccountable, from creating deadly new facts on the ground. To stay at the table, they must publicly stroke his ego and privately explain the facts in small words (like, death) and big numbers.

The difference with the COVID-19 effort is the intensity of the research.  Also, although science is competitive, I was not that aware of colleagues “hiding” data.

On the one hand, this article explains that scientists are racing to find a vaccine and suggests that any “secrecy” around this work is “eroding” out of necessity to find a cure quickly.

I hope we can have an open and honest discussion about this process of understanding, and mapping the genome of this corona virus.

Here is a link that suggests this corona virus is pretty unique due to the presence of 4 DNA strands previously only found in the HIV virus.

But as scientists race to invent a vaccine, there are a host of challenges that may take well over a year to solve.

Meanwhile, our country struggles to provide a concerted national testing program that includes wide-spread testing for antibodies as well as an immediate test to see if one is exposed and currently infected. Without testing, we are flying blind; and without knowing the genetic details, a race for a vaccine will be a pipe dream."
2020-04-01 17:29:42,"This has been the way science and research have worked, regardless of the field - we share an intellectual
interest that naturally transcend human borders and material gains (most of the time), we all build upon the work of other and previous scientists, so that it is extremely rare for an idea, a discovery to occur purely on its own.

Unfortunately the real world often imposes its own reality by attempting to limit collaboration in the name of national
security or intellectual property, sometimes for valid reasons because some researchers or nations seek their own glory or advantage.

In our research labs, we try to aim for the ideal while staying within the rules - national, HIPAA, NIH, etc...- regarding data and knowledge transfer."

With Wells' usual prescience, he predicts WWII beginning in 1940 with a sneak attack on the British fleet, but in his scenario, the war last for 30 years, reducing the world to rubble and brigandage. In a last ditch effort, the ""enemy"" releases a plague ""The Wandering Sickness"", which runs rampant, and kills a third of the planet's population. Civilization is almost lost except for the efforts of the world's remaining scientists and engineers, who from their headquarters in Basra, reconquer the Earth and rebuild civilization along scientific principles, with erasing national boundaries as a prerequisite. Wells' hero John Cabal termed it the ""Freemasonry of Science"". Even Wells foresaw the problems inherent in this new world order and leaves it to the viewer to weigh the benefits.

According to the Times reporting, on December 30, a Chinese doctor alerted his colleagues of a possible reoccurrence of SARS and was told to not spread rumors. By January 23rd, the city of Wuhan was in lockdown. That is a little over 3 weeks. Obviously, the Chinese government was not ignoring the disease but investigating. What they have learned in these three weeks? (1) It is a new disease with a new virus. Chinese scientists sequenced its DNA and shared with the rest of world in early January. (2) The infection can spread from people to people which lead to the decision to lock-down Wuhan. After that, they also learned and told the rest of the world that (3) asymptomatic transmission is possible. With all these knowledge, what the governments in the west did? US president thinks the whole thing is exaggerated until a week ago. Three months after the Chines told the world of the new disease. If the Times thinks the Chinese government restored to its old habit of keeping secrets, maybe one can suggest Times also has old habit of bias toward a developing country, like China with an authoritarian system? One lesson the Times can learn from the Chinese government is once credibility is lost, it is difficult to earn it back.

It is refreshing to see scientists working unselfishly toward a singular goal for once. Too bad our political leaders can't bring themselves to operate the same way."

2020-04-02 12:48:03,"Globalized science also has made a globalized special and closed class, which is called as [the scientists’ community]. When this class speaks, be cautious: Look at what happened re SARS-2. Some of the Chinese scientists are paid-guns by GMO industries. They have covered up the truth then and now. If you question them, you are attacked by them. And the whole world is suffering by their scientific lies."
2020-04-02 13:15:17,"An online group of embryologists from around the world begun to meet this week via Zoom to deal with this virus in practical terms in IVF. World renowned members of our field Dutch born US based Dr Jacques Cohen and British Dr Kay Elder, a virologist and embryologist led a group of 2000 of us on our initial meeting to discuss openly how best to deal with the issues that this novel virus presents to us in our field handling human gametes and embryos. Previously as stated, science is a competitive, our field included, and having this openness will help us all cope with our new reality living with the Corona virus."
2020-04-09 13:13:28,"Being asthmatic I have looked at every study pertaining to asthma and Covid-19 and the correlation appears to be inconclusive or irrelevant.  The chronic lung diseases they are talking about are emphysema, cystic fibrosis, those who have had lung cancer, and those who are chronic smokers, etc.  Those with controlled asthma appear to fare no worse than those without it. The latest scientific journals also concur with what I have found.  Asthmatics have extremely strong lungs when it comes to oxygen intake (it's the exhaling that's the issue when suffering an attack)."
2020-04-09 13:14:44,"The data that all of us want, that we will need in order to feel safe about coming out of our bunkers is absent.

How many had the virus and recovered with only minor problems; who had the virus and was never sick enough to know it. What is our REAL chance of ending up in the hospital? 
Our age, our health, our job - how do we manage to go about our days living with fear?

We need a lot more data, and don't have a lot of time to acquire it."
2020-04-09 13:29:25,"I would like to see an article like this break out the impacts of age and underlying medical conditions.  People who are older have more underlying medical conditions that contribute to the disease.  What is the hospitalization rate, or death rate, for people in their 60's, 70's, etc. who are healthy?  Surely it is lower than for people with an underlying medical problem, but the chart here does not tell you.  So it does not tell people who are older but healthy what their risk is.  And how much risk they might be able to run to assist their friends and neighbors."
2020-04-09 13:46:04,"Without taking into account people who become infected with Covid-19 and develop mild or no symptoms at all, this data is incomplete. Those who suffer mild symptoms might make up 80-90 percent of the population as a whole. What are the underlying conditions and commonalities in this group? We’ll be reading articles analyzing the numbers for years. And I’m guessing these future studies will be far more accurate."
2020-04-09 14:10:06,"So employees considered essential by their bosses—that would be a lot—should take their own temperatures and go to work. Even though they have in fact been exposed to the virus. Though we know people have it and spread it without symptoms for days or longer. In other words, employers can demand that whoever they want must go into workplaces this way and with other exposed workers—and that requirement is acceptable to the “protectors” of the public health. I know some republicans say we should be fine dying for the economy. I guess we’ve come to the part where workers are forced to work in pandemic conditions. But I don’t see how customers can be forced back into stores, malls, etc., to spend. I’m not in a mood for a shopping trip, and no one I know is in a mood to spend."
2020-04-09 14:13:04,"Since hypertension is also seen with obesity, heart disease and underlying medical conditions, I would like to see the risk data for people with only hypertension. Especially since it is so common. It’s hard to tell if hypertension alone is a significant risk factor"
2020-04-09 14:26:45,"I hope data is being collected on other health information- for example, are the people with mild cases the people who are up to date with vaccinations such as whopping cough and measles, mumps, etc.  Of course, the problem is testing isn't being done except when people are generally in bad shape already.  The statistics show people of color are at higher risk of serious cases including death.  If the underlying problem is proven to be a lack of health insurance and no regular doctor visits to handle routine heath issues, then of course they are no doubt behind on things such as vaccinations."
2020-04-09 14:36:57,"Unless I missed it, the report does not mention how many hospitalized patients were smokers. I'd be curious to see those numbers."
2020-04-09 14:55:54,"I would like to see a federally  funded program to get everyone in the US tested for covid antibodies. 

We are so far behind in knowing who WAS  infected and who IS infected.  

Then we can have some pertinent data about risks."
2020-04-09 14:59:25,"If they measure the undercounted who die at home that might even out the male/female disparity.  Women have higher tolerance for pain of any kind, and as caregivers of others in the household may be more reluctant to seek out care until it is too late to save them."
2020-04-09 15:23:55,"I’m also not seeing analysis of the millions of people with autoimmune diseases, including those on immunosuppressants vs not on immunosuppressants.

One note, on average it takes 3-5 years for a patient with complaints to finally be diagnosed with an autoimmune disease; some obviously take longer because symptoms vary so much and mimic other diseases. Many people are probably or have been COVID19 positive and no one knows it, which could be a factor in response to supportive therapies. Patients will need to be followed long term."
2020-04-09 14:06:58,Where are the tests? Now that data show that African Americans are at higher risks the focus has shifted to restarting the economy. We need testing for all. Why are we talking about restarting the economy? We need tests!! Where is the pressure to get these tests? Democrats? Biden? Bernie? Somebody speak up for us.
2020-04-09 13:51:03,"There's a link  between the end of this article and the comments to another recent article: 'Younger Adults Make Up Big Portion of Coronavirus Hospitalizations in U.S.March 18, 2020""

It would appear that one of these articles isn't correct unless I'm missing something."
2020-04-09 13:47:01,"Is anyone counting how many of those who are sick are avid Fox News/Hannity followers, versus those who get info from doctors and scientists?  Given the amount of false info put out by the right, one would think they would be more likely to spread it.  Unfortunately, they seem to spread it to everyone, not just their political cohorts.  Esp. the medical workers who care for all."
2020-04-09 14:53:56,"I live in Iowa, one of the few states whose governors have not issued ""stay at home"" orders.  Gov. Kim Reynolds is a fool who only listens to business leaders and conservative religious leaders.   No surprise, she is perfectly willing to let Covid spread, affecting low-wage workers disproportionately.  As long as she doesn't issue a stay-at-home order, most employers are free to demand that their workers show up and risk exposure and spread.  I have patients who have been told they will be considered to have resigned if they miss work without a doctor's order.  These folks are not in ""essential"" positions: a church janitor (he doesn't even get sick leave), a clerical worker, factory workers in ag manufacturing, etc.  And whatever these people are exposed to, they bring home to their families.  I have no doubt that Reynolds would have issued stay-at-home orders long ago if Covid were found to hit fetuses as hard as it hits older people and those with health problems."
2020-04-09 15:09:46,"This is exactly what data from Italy, Germany, France etc. Has been saying for the past three weeks.
Older men, those with pre existing conditions, and those unhealthy (overweight) are most at risk.

The answer is to confine old and sick people. Not shut down the entire economy of every country."
2020-04-09 13:52:13,The most common was hypertension. What does that tell up?  Over 64% of males over age 60 have hypertension.  So it tells us a lot of nothing.
2020-04-09 14:31:59,"be wary of how the numbers are presented, particularly in describing outcomes as being racially indicative of bias.

urban centers are the current hot spots. they also are likely to have a higher number of minorities in concentration.

poverty and habits are stronger indicators of health outcomes in a community than skin color.

in the case of this article, the hotspots all have higher concentrations of black people who are poor than is seen in the national population.

it makes mathematical sense that in the high density hotspots with high numbers of poor minorities that they would over represented in the outcomes.

for example, hypertension is over represented in the black population across the nation at all times, not just now. that is true everywhere in the US.

 hypertension is not racist it is just a medical condition and it is controllable be medication and better habits. that many poor people are black does not mean it is a race issue. 

if you look at just poor people across that nation, more poor whites have hypertension than poor blacks, but the percentage of the black community affected is higher. that is math issue as there are more whites than blacks in the U.S.

let's not make the pandemic a race card."
2020-04-09 14:56:49,"The CDC Guidance on keeping essential workers on the job does not mention anything about getting workers tested for COVID-19 if they have been exposed. Does the COVID-19 trace contacting data from the last few months support this recommendation as numerous news stories show that people without symptoms are super spreaders of the disease. An employee with no symptoms but carrying the virus could potentially wipeout a significant portion of the company's workforce. Getting essential workers, who have been exposed to COVID-19, tested immediately is a better solution and if the results come back negative, he or she would be allowed to return to work. There must be a shortage of tests, despite what the president says, and this guidance document is proof."
2020-04-09 13:36:11,"In addition to looking at increased risk factors of hypertension and diabetes, maybe we should probably consider the following questions:

1. Are there more multigenerational households in Black communities? If so, are Blacks more at risk because of this?

2. Do Blacks have larger extended families than Whites; and are these family members mistakenly “trusted” as being virus-free simply due to kinship?

3. Since the church is extremely important in the Black community, are people inadvertently letting down their guard around “trusted” fellow church members?

4. Do Blacks have more informal childcare arrangements where women are looking after the children of working relatives and neighbors? Perhaps some of the kids could be asymptomatic vectors?

5.  Of course, there is also the fact that a disproportionate number of Black people are in jobs in the areas of transportation, retail, private childcare, care of the elderly and disabled, and care/transport of the dead,  that put them at increased risk. 

6. Were Black people with ""mild"" COVID-19 symptoms more likely than Whites to be refused early treatment?

7. Are  Blacks with ""mild"" COVID-19 symptoms more likely than Whites to not seek treatment due to a history of bad experiences when interacting with the mostly white medical community?"
2020-04-09 14:11:54,"Please publish stats & specifics on the underlying conditions!! Research suggests the bulk of hospitalized Covid-19 patients are people with Metabolic Syndrome and people with compromised lung function. This must not be ignored. Critical information!

Metabolic Syndrome means having at least 3 of 5 of the following conditions: high blood sugar (or taking meds to control it); high blood pressure (or taking meds to control it); high triglycerides (or taking meds to control it); low HDL cholesterol (or taking cholesterol meds); abdominal obesity/apple shape. Metabolic Syndrome is considered a lifestyle disease, 100% reversible in most people via basic lifestyle and targeted nutritional interventions which favor natural foods, and reduced carbohydrate consumption. 

Both plant-based Mediterranean style diets and animal based ketogenic diets are effective in reversing Metabolic Syndrome. The drugs prescribed to manage Metabolic Syndrome symptoms do nothing to cure the underlying issues. They are merely a band-aid that Covid-19 is ripping off, with painful and tragic consequences."
2020-04-09 15:33:49,"People under 50 make up most infections and result in way fewer deaths.
the actual death rate for those patients is very low."

We cannot take for granted the risk for all and the  potential to infect others does not go away with this news."
2020-04-09 16:27:10,"So, for those younger than 18 SARS-CoV-2 is less dangerous than the flu. But we stopped all K-12 classes.

For those 18-50 (prime working age) it is about as dangerous as the flu. But we close all their work places.

For older Americans it is 2 to 3 times more dangerous than the flu, but we put on them the same restrictions as the rest of the population - no tailored actions.

Smart?"
2020-04-09 16:36:22,Ask the workers to return to critical workforce but no hazard pay? I guess CEOs who get millions in bonus can go do the critical work in the front line.
2020-04-09 15:49:26,"The CDC has, so unfortunately, become untrustworthy. 
Sluggish unfocused Redfield needs to go. A sharp energetic wise man or woman who can stand up to trump, and a deadly virus, needs to be put in charge. At once."
2020-04-09 16:52:43,What is missing in this article is what is the percentage of people with the preexisting medical conditions that need to be hospitalized vs those without?
2020-04-09 16:32:53,"Testing! What percentage of the population is being tested! From what I can gather, only if you have the full symptoms of COVID do you get tested. How many time bombs are walking around, faces not covered, hands not washed, spreading this to others."
2020-04-09 17:05:24,"One thing that I've never been clear about reading these articles- are we talking about treated or untreated hypertension? I have chronic hypertension, but it's controlled with medication. If we're talking about people who have high blood pressure and aren't doing anything about it, the coronavirus should be the least of their concerns.

It would also be helpful to see the proportion of patients who had multiple preexisting conditions, hypertension + something else, etc."
2020-04-09 16:20:09,Finally doing lots of testing so getting useful data. New cases continue to slowly decline. Log scale flattening. Deaths continue to rise because of lag effect. CDC says nearly 90% of hospitalizations had one or more severe underlying conditions. And 75% of cases over 65. Message: Wear a mask in public for now. Practice physical distancing. Self-isolate if you are in an at-risk group. Stop using products with added sugar. Stop smoking cigarettes. Stop with the white bread and flour. Get exercise. Stop blaming others. Take charge now. And stop shaking hands.
2020-04-09 16:30:17,"The diseases that affect the black community, obesity, smoking, diabetes, high rate of heart disease, are also found in large numbers in poor white communities. I would like to see numbers that can disaggregate the effects of poverty from the effects of race. I suspect that race will still be a factor, but not as strong a factor as we see now."
2020-04-09 18:00:51,"Testing as many citizens as possible - with or without symptoms -  will be vital it understanding the true spread and deadliness of the virus. While i realize that its not possible to snap our fingers and test 300+ million people in a couple months , with the new tests that are rolling out that can test for antibodies, we should be covering the full cost of these tests for anyone and everyone to get a true sense of the numbers. 

  Many are wondering if that cough or fever they had in Dec or Jan was just the flu or cold, or if they did actually have the virus. 

 However, its a fine line we are walking between mandatory testing and vaccine shots for everyone, with all this info stored in a government database."
2020-04-09 18:40:37,"Across the total adult U.S. populations, what percentages of color and non-color have underlying conditions? To what extent does income inequality account for these percentages? To what extent does employment in essential services account for these percentages?"
2020-04-09 18:43:18,"I’m a physician epidemiologist. I also have a Bachelors degree in math and physics so I’m fairly well versed in statistics.

First off, the number of Coronavirus cases doesn’t tell us much.

Second, more testing is not necessarily needed, as long as we are telling everyone to stay home anyway and to wear a mask if out. It may alter the psyche of people who have tested positive in that they are likely to stay home (but this is conjecture). It is important, however, to know WHO we are testing: patients sick enough to be hospitalized? Patients who are HCWs? In long term care? That is the only way one can make sense of numbers. 

The best indicator is not the number of cases but hospitalization rates with the denominator being per population. Here, it is clear that hospitalization rates are 3-8 x that of influenza. Sounds scary, except for the fact that you are looking at going from about 0.003% to 0.015%, I.e., a small number multiplied by a big number is still a small number. However, should this get out of control, and large numbers of people get this virus, we are then looking at huge numbers presenting to the hospital and overwhelming the system. Keeping up social distancing is important, but becomes less important as more people get immunity. Perhaps a study needs to be done looking at how many people already have immunity, once serologies are available.

Finally, I hope that America realizes that it’s high time UBI and a universal health care system are urgently needed."
2020-04-09 18:45:36,"To be admitted to a hospital, a Covid patient is already very sick, or doing poorly as the Brits would say. They are very labor, pharmaceutical and supply intensive patients running up large bills.
No elective surgery which are all higher margin procedures than the ICU.

Rural hospitals are on the edge now."
2020-04-09 18:57:03,Every county in this nation should test as many people as possible who have no symptoms. That will give us an indication of the penetrance of the virus. I simply don’t get why we aren’t doing that.
2020-04-09 19:22:47,"I am not sure where they got the hospital rate for the flu because this is copied from the CDC website

The overall cumulative hospitalization rate was 67.9 per 100,000 population, which is higher than all recent seasons at this time of year except for the 2017-18 season. Rates in children 0-4 years old and adults 18-49 years old are now the highest CDC has on record for these age groups, surpassing the rate reported during the 2009 H1N1 pandemic. Hospitalization rates for school-aged children are higher than any recent regular season but lower than rates during the pandemic."
2020-04-09 19:28:20,"Without the prevalence of underlying conditions in the general population, which is not mentioned in the piece, it's hard to know if the presence in COVID-19 hospitalizations matters. The CDC does reference a the prevalence of some underlying conditions, but nothing that can be compared to the 90%. That 90% is basically meaningless without that general number."
2020-04-09 19:28:39,"One can only wonder why states which tend to be most supportive of the so-called ""right-to-life"" movement are, nonetheless, the same states which oppose saving lives by locking down."
2020-04-09 19:34:18,"In Virginia, when reviewing daily updates on the number of tests conducted the previous day and the number of new cases, almost without exception there is a direct correlation between the number of tests and the number of cases.   

What concerns me is that on days when there is a smaller increase in cases from the previous day, some could interpret this as an indication that the crisis is relenting when in fact it is likely only because there were fewer tests conducted that same day.  And regardless of how many tests are conducted,  the percentage of those in Virginia who test positive for the COVID-19 virus has risen to approximately 12% and has been at the point for the last 7 days.  

If Trump claims to be the country's cheerleader, he can cheer only when the number of cases goes down as testing goes up because until there are tests available for all citizens, we will be unable to gauge the actual degree of threat. Trump's decisions on when to ""open the country"" must be driven by data rather than his ""aspirations."""
2020-04-09 19:37:15,"Vitamin D supplements have been conclusively shown to significantly reduce both the risk and severity of respiratory infections (both viral and bacterial).  We get most of our Vitamin D from sunlight, and lighter skin color evolved as a means of producing more Vitamin D from less sunlight. 
 This may help explain part of the racial disparity in severe cases.  I encourage everyone to begin taking Vitamin D supplements, especially those with darker complexions. I also encourage everyone to research this topic on your own if you are skeptical, as I think it is strongly supported by the evidence."
2020-04-09 20:23:45,"In the city data, the mortality of Asians is way much lower than any other group.  Even considering per capita.  The biggest differences are women vs men and Asians vs any other ethnic group. 
Women vs men probably is due to immune system difference, as women age more slowly, so they have better immune system compared to men at a specific age. 
It would be interesting to break down by socioeconomic level as well, and see if people of different ethnic groups at a similar   socioeconomic  level have comparable mortality rates. 

And if Asians’ strikingly lower mortality is due to compliance, diet, genetics."

2020-04-09 20:51:08,"From this CDC report it is apparent that people who were over weight; had higher than normal blood pressure; and who had chronic diseases, e. g. diabetes were more susceptible to the severe forms of this coronavirus. 

Unfortunately, due the nature of providing health care in the U. S. lower income; men who probably smoked or were in occupations with higher incidences of respiratory conditions/diseases; and black people (demographic term used in the article or CDC report?); are at a disadvantage if they contract the Covid19 virus. 

Health care providers, economic (businesses, insurance companies, etc.) organizations, social (community  faith, & health insurance companies) have to redouble their efforts to reach the most vulnerable (in terms of being most susceptible to acute diseases, e. g., flu, corona19) to reduce their high blood pressure, use diet & exercise to improve their diabetes, and reduce industrial exposure to air contaminants."
2020-04-09 21:03:58,"The CDC is a fantastic organization and is responsible for saving thousands of lives.  One of the small ways they are attempting to do that is publishing 100% accurate and 100% intentionally misleading data.  Pay special attention to the bar chart age bands in the article.  Note the huge age range in the 18 - 49 chart showing very approximately 2.25 hospitalizations per 100,000 people. 

Far more segmented data is available if you're willing to drill down.  There is tremendous skew in the outcomes based on age range.  IE the 18-20 year old's in that range are much closer to the 5-17 year old data sets. 

It should be obvious to anyone who choses to look at the data that the CDC is doing this because younger workers could see clearly that their mortality risk falls somewhere between 1/1,000 and 1/10,000 (and this is if they become infected).  

An entire generation is being asked to bare years of hardship to protect the wealthy old.   Best hope for a curve bending, a cure, and a return to a better normal than we had before."

Trump says he hasn’t heard anything about testing. Every day the Times has at least one article that mentions the lack of tests. He should take a look.

It’s incomprehensible that after a month of discussion tests are not available for everyone. Trump and Pence either are willfully keeping testing down, are incredibly incompetent, or our medical infrastructure is simply not capable of meeting the demand. 

I doubt there will ever be enough tests such that anyone who has symptoms can get tested, and even those without can as well. This administration has sunk to a new and deadly level of incompetence."

The percentage of  hospitalized that are African American may seem high relative to overall population, but not for the hotspots -- e.g., more than 25% of NYC population is African American, and 60% in New Orleans. 

The only segment of the population that has been really disproportionally impacted is healthcare workers. Not just urban clinics, but even Harvard hospitals have 200+ healthcare workers infected. It is shameful that we were and still are not able to provide them with basic personal protection equipment. 

Not many nurses will qualify for $1,200 stimulus paychecks the Congress is providing -- Congress needs to extend this to anyone in a qualified medical profession (nurses, doctors, pharmacists, lab workers) employed by a medical facility or hospital. That is the least we can do for them. I am not one of them and will not be getting that check. 

We also need to produce a ton more masks and distribute these to the general public. California will import 200 million masks a month for the next several months. It is shameful that the President who ran on the platform of moving industrial jobs back to America can't even get companies to make simple things like masks."

This virus may hit the respiratory system the hardest, but in addition to aerosolization and droplet transmission, fecal-oral is another potent route, and we're not testing for that.  Moreover, about 50% of respiratory tests are negative when the same person tested the same day shows a positive result for fecal testing.  

Our whole world is subject to the mounting deaths and economic destruction because we can't do simple math and understand that this virus is being rampantly spread through all forms for weeks prior to the first symptoms, which are now known to often not be fever - they may be as simple as ""pink eye"" or loss of taste/smell.  

Shut downs are needed on a simultaneous global action, masks mandatory (even homemade ones alone reduce each person's spread through aerosolization and droplets by 50%) for everyone once they leave their front door, and of course, social distancing (6' for walking/standing, 24' for exercising), all for 4 months.

After AIDS moved into the American main stream (i.e. white heterosexual males) Republicans half-heartedly decided to address the pandemic.

I think Republicans initially handled COVID-19 in the same way. The virus was more likely to be contracted by people who are in the service sector and to a degree people of color who comprise those job groups. Now that there is an economic toll that affects affluent Americans, Trump has decided it is a crisis. (Not really.)

Ironically, people of color who paid little mind to the AIDS pandemic when they thought it affected only gays and sho believed it was God’s way of punishing gays, are now very vocal about how blacks are bearing the brunt of COVID-19. Where were these voices of outrage in the early 1980’s? I am not sure they would be outraged if COVID affected only the LGBT community."

Seriously? This is an insane and wildly inaccurate statement. Iran is NOT in a summer climate. Iran is in the Northern Hemisphere. Temperatures in Iran have been tracking pretty much with the Northeast US through the entire crisis. 

Is Australia experiencing a rapid spread? NO. A country of 24 million, they picked at just over 600 new cases a day WEEKS ago, and since then new cases have plummeted consistently. Yesterday they logged numbers only in the double digits.

Imagine if this pandemic had taken place before the broad proliferation of online merchant business models for virtually everything and anything for sale to the consumer market.  The over-run of local stores, particularly grocery and drug stores would have been much much worse than what happened in the second half of March when panic shoppers were literally stripping shelves bare in brick and mortar stores. 

I noticed this week, which is the beginning of our 4th week of shutdown in my county... grocery store shopping is largely returning to normal.  There are still some limits being imposed on some items... but other than rice, pasta, canned chili, toilet paper, and eggs... everything else appears to be in good supply at the local grocery stores.   Which leads to the conclusion that most of the panic driven buying and hoarding has subsided now. 

And online merchants like Amazon, after getting literally striped bare of many items in the second half of March, a growing range of in demand food items are slowly returning to more reasonable availability and prices."

If there are lucky enough to be picked for a job they may come in contact with folks that have the virus and bring it home to their families. Home could be renting rooms in a house with many others that are spreaders. Many of those sell food or goods on the streets and mingle with customers while doing so. Eventually many will become sick and invariably go directly to an emergency room for treatment because they cannot pay. What about tax paying citizens who have medical insurance and are born or legally entered the US earning a green card - what's fair about the illegal using our precious resources for free while others are waiting to be treated? We don't have enough ventilators, masks, gloves, nurses or doctors for legal resident services - but now the illegal demands the same as we do too?

The methodology of large scale randomized trials is reliable, however, in an intense emergency situation with a high and rapid rate of mortality, parallel trials of multiple different potential treatments has equal scientific power to identify a real efficacious agent.

This will not be easy, but it can happen. As this article points out, progress is being made.

Importantly, this will require international cooperation, and a joint effort of government agencies, academia, and the pharmaceutical industry. The participation of drug companies is essential; these companies have the resources necessary for drug development, testing, and manufacturing.

Today, pharmaceutical firms face an existential threat to their existence: lawsuits filed by American tort lawyers. In my opinion, most of these suits are based on emotion and sympathetic plaintiffs, and not on science. The  companies win many, probably most cases. But some jury verdicts go against the firms, and there have been multiple, multi-billion dollar verdicts, including against Johnson and Johnson, and Bayer. Literally tens of thousands of additional suits are pending.  It does not take many exorbitant verdicts to bankrupt a company.

Trial lawyers nearly shut down the vaccine industry in the US during the 1970’s and ‘80s; only a last minute no fault liability law by Congress, the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act, allowed vaccine availability to continue in this country.

Congress needs to pass tort reform. Ask yourself: today, do we need more lawsuits, or effective drugs?"

Vaccines, even experimental vaccines, are extremely safe. Critics can point to examples such as the 1976 swine flu vaccine. 40 million people were vaccinated and there were about 30 deaths attributable to the vaccine. Covid-19, in contrast, has a death rate of >1%.  

I propose the following: 

-Mass production of candidate vaccines should commence the moment highly promising animal studies have been completed. Worse case scenario is that the product is wasted if the vaccine fails to prove its benefit. 

-Immediately commence large scale clinical studies for candidate vaccines that combine the typical phase 1/2/3 studies into a single study. The study will be large enough so that different doses of the vaccine can be assessed. Full disclosure of the unusual experimental nature of this type of study will be provided. Volunteers will consist of those at high enough risk that they fear the virus more than the vaccine and of those who feel they are providing a public service. I myself am happy to volunteer. 

This approach will shave months off vaccine development and almost certainly save millions of lives as compared to the more traditional cautious approach."

Bad to see no central authority over it all by the federal government. It's business as usual in that regard. 

Make no mistake here.... this is a race for the golden egg as much as it is altruistic in nature. 

The first companies with a viable vaccine are going to hold the federal government hostage over fees for it's use.  And because the federal government did not take a leadership role here.... it is going to pay these hostage fees, whether it wants to or not. 

I can see it now.... vaccinations billed out at $1000 a pop, and the government will have to step in and soak up the costs or the vaccines will only be available to those that can actually afford them."

The best takeaway - Novovax is taking the traditional approach to vaccine manufacturing - they're artificially generating i.e ""expressing"" coronavirus using a very standard bread and butter expression method with baculovirus as the vector (BEVS). Don't let the baculovirus muddy the waters. 

Moderna and Inovio are gambling that the spike protein will elicit the best immune response and devised two different ways to express that instead of making the whole virus to for your immune systems' target practice. More risky but could be cheaper/produce better yields."
2020-04-09 16:17:42,"While I applaud the intense pace in looking for viable vaccine designs... that is for the long run solution for the world. 

This article really should have focused on the emerging treatments that help patients avoid viral pneumonia setting in, and/or treatments to help patients with pneumonia recover more quickly and safely, with much lower mortality rates and with much lower need for putting patients on ventilators. 

In effect... data around the world shows that 80%+ of the population who catches the virus recover without incident, many with little or no symptoms.  What is needed in the short term are effective treatments that can help the other 20% avoid extended intensive care and the need for being put on a ventilator. 

Vaccines put a virus behind us.... but it is effective treatments for the complications of the virus that are the present crisis that is over-whelming healthcare systems around the world."

Verifone requires all buttons be selected with the light pen as well as the signature. A signature isn't necessary especially when the slippery plastic wand sliding across the screen combined with your unsupported hand makes it unrecognizable. Most people just draw a line across the box and it makes no difference. It has been reported that Verifone was going to discontinue the use of signatures anyway.

2020-04-10 19:26:01,"Some of the non-Covid deaths may have occurred because the health care system has been overwhelmed fighting the pandemic.

For instance, one has to wonder whether someone died of a heart attack because the ambulance that would otherwise have come was already busy answering a Covid call.  Consequently, life saving immediate care could not be provided to the heart attack victim.

But a suggestion: please break this down by age. Perhaps just two age groups: 65 and up, and below 65. I have to guess that most of the excess is in the older group, the same pattern that seasonal influenza follows. And the pattern that the 1918 flu spectacularly did not."
2020-04-10 20:17:29,"When one considers the stress associated with living far differently than is normal, the pressure of dealing with illness within families, and the uncertainty that people face during this pandemic, it makes sense that we are seeing an increase in deaths beyond those that are strictly virus victims. Deaths from heart attacks, strokes, suicide, violence and other causes will rise when people are under duress.
  
CoVide-19 casts a pall over the entire population, beyond those who suffer from the virus itself. It limits people's ability to access to rapid response emergency care when first responders must don personal protective equipment (PPE) before taking a call. People may be reluctant to call for help when suffering a non-virus emergency for fear of exposure, or of over-burdening our straining health resources.  

This virus has also been blamed for a spike in domestic violence and abuse of children, as people are forced to remain home and financial stresses, commodities shortages, and plain old fear push tempers beyond limits.

The real bottom line is this: stress kills. CoVid-19 itself causes deaths, but even those who never fall ill with the virus are dealing with extraordinary situations that it has necessitated."

As in America, this probably means that only about half of COVID deaths are actuallly being officially counted.

Yeah, no big deal, it's just old people who are a costly, unproductive drag on the economy, with not much more to contribute, so who cares - let's get back to looking after ourselves and doing what America does best, make more money.

Maybe we have to print them up and tack them on telephone poles, the old fashioned way, to help communities wake up to the real harm running amok."
2020-04-10 22:01:04,"As predicted, the public health system is now in many places overwhelmed. 

The currently reported high mortality may be due to (1) it being difficult to treat patients with regular often fatal diseases but without Corvid-19, (2) it may be due that such fatal diseases are predisposing factors to Corvid-19, and (3) it may be due to a combined effect of Corvid-19 and some fatal diseases. 

Undercounting is possible and plausible: an infectious disease often carries a stigma, not only to the patient but to the place where he lives as well."
2020-04-10 22:08:03,"I would bet that the death rate from heart attacks and strokes is going up, but that people are dying at home rather than in hospitals.
Several weeks ago a friend in a high-COVID region complained to her doctor about chest pains.  The doctor did not send her to the hospital, and she did not insist. Two weeks later she died suddenly at home, from what was evidently a massive heart attack.  She was 75 and otherwise in good health.
Under normal circumstances, she would still be alive."
2020-04-10 22:22:27,"This is excellent work and allows us to get a far better handle on the death rate from the virus rather than the CFR (case fatality ratio), which is deaths/cases.  There is a lag period for deaths, and the CFR is often an underestimate. 

I hope we can get coronavirus testing on the bodies who were found outside the hospital, because the more accurate the data, the better modeling will be.

Furthermore, since the virus attacks other organs, including the brain, diagnoses of stroke and myocardial infarction need to be considered as possibly related. Since we know how many of those are occurring in hospitals, we can probably make adjustments to those numbers."
2020-04-10 20:51:17,"This confirms the pandemic is much worse than we're told. The death toll is much higher than officially recorded.

The only reason Coronavirus hospitalizations are flat is that the profoundly ill are either staying away, or being turned away. 

It is not opinion, I personally know medical staff at the forefront of this pandemic at 4 major hospitals who have in confidence described horrific conditions. All NYC hospitals are now Covid-19 hospitals. Patients needing surgery for life threatening, yet operable, malignancies are having surgeries cancelled. Admissions are flat because there aren't enough resources for even basic care. Medical staff must reuse PPE. 

In one major facility patients were all over the hallways, left in gurneys because there were no beds left. People died in droves. Patients were terrified. One medical professional could do nothing for many but take a few moments to try to calm their terrible fear of dying alone. She also gave them sedatives, but said there's even a shortage of such basic meds. So many patients go into cardiac arrest in the hospitals that the staff often can't even attempt to resuscitate everyone. 

People are staying away from the hospitals. If they show up, the staff out of compassion often sends them home if they can walk, isolate, and not infect others. They tell them to return if they cannot breathe. It's why over 300 Covid-19 patients die in apartments every day, the morgues or overflowing, and there's a mass grave in the Bronx."

2020-04-11 00:55:27,"Can author or somebody please clairfy the way the data was collected here? It seems that the author simply took the average number of deaths and manually added all corona virus deaths as incremental deaths. None of the cited sources provide data for any non-flu or non-corona related deaths for the period current period that is charted (March/April 2020).

It seems very problematic to assume all deaths will be the same and all corona-related deaths are necessarily incremental to the total death count."

2020-04-11 01:59:27,"Excellent work. Because testing for COVID-19 is not happening at all for most people who die in their residences and most people who die in nursing homes and other care facilities, the official number of COVID-19 related deaths reported is much lower than reality. Is it possible to get similar charts for each State  and aggregate data at the national level? Comparing the mortality counts for the last 30 and 60 days to averages from previous years for the same period of time would be way to estimate the COVID-19 death toll, given that we still have availability issues with testing. This is the methodology that was used to estimated disease related death counts in the past (e.g. 1918 Spanish Flu) before it was even possible to run specific tests for a virus."
2020-04-11 03:33:44,"It is appreciated to see these sad and sobering death totals data discussed in more detail. For instance, I have been wondering how the numbers have been being tallied.

For example, if someone is confirmed infected with Covid living in one city and transported for care to a hospital facility in a second city, do both cities count the infected as data, or just their hometown. And if sadly they die if further transferred to a third city-location that is a rehabilitation center, do all three cities then count the deceased as infected and deceased data, or no?

Ultimately, it is grim that we are looking at these numbers from different angles, but agreed that it's essential and eye-opening for tracking the sick and trends in the virus on many different levels."

But why are the democrats obsessed in digging up numbers who aren't even dead? 
You would think they believe more fatalities mean more dead people turning up to vote for them in November."
2020-04-11 04:38:45,"Thank you for the great  graphs  and clear analysis of how Corona  deaths are under counted and how this can be addressed. Unfortunately, the legitimate  fear of systematic discounting is justified as it is an effective tool to  maintain the status quo and  damage control for leadership and public  health systems. This  is starting to play out in USA - less talk of testing for surveillance  and actual #s  and in some instances what appears to be deliberate dis-counting of Corona deaths. All justified by leadership's desire to declare some victory to the existing health  systems and government response, and encourage a gradual economic return which will again put the most vulnerable and poor  of society again in the front lines for next wave of the epidemic. This will be repeated in more authoritarian countries. God help us."
2020-04-11 09:28:48,"I wonder if this includes deaths resulting from traffic accidents. Given that everyone is staying home, there should be a decrease in overall number of deaths due to less traffic accidents.

It might be that deaths resulting due to traffic accidents inside the city is not significant enough."
2020-04-11 10:21:29,"Only takes a child's mind to see the obvious: we are radically undercounting the deaths that can be almost directly attributed to COVID-19, as are likely other governments--both local and national-- around the world."
2020-04-11 11:24:56,"I don't think that the only reason to question our current policies of shutting down enormous elements of the economy is to claim that the coronavirus isn't killing people. Perhaps some conspiracy-minded people on the right will argue that, but there is also a level-headed, non-political (though I happen to be well on the left) argument that we have coupled panic and exaggeration to dreadful economic effect. And the truth is we will not know the public health impact on these policies until better epidemiological research is presented.  
Every death is filled with emotion for those involved. It would be great if our society could grapple better with this fact that eventually we all must face. With death we do not typically get what we want, there is conflict and or course deep sorrow. But what we are doing right now is trying to control all of that by controlling a single cause of death and to do it we are creating incredible, long-lasting economic and social damage (of course we are also creating environmental benefit). The household and governmental budget shortfalls that we are creating will also lead to death and suffering, especially for the poor, who always suffer more negative health outcomes and now will have more economic problems than ever. 
Why can we not find a middle ground based on what is known about transmission, morbidity and mortality -- and critical economic analysis too?"
2020-04-11 12:51:25,"Of course, within the age group most impacted by the coronavirus - those over 80 - these become deaths that won't happen over the next couple of years depressing the death rates within those time frames."

2020-04-10 22:03:01,"Luckily, the president will have all the metrics in his head when he will decide to re-open the economy with a ""Big bang""."
2020-04-11 11:51:32,"This virus is certainly a crisis but the worst thing people can do is to jump to conclusions and panic and spread fear.

As FDR taught us, the only thing you have to fear is fear itself. 

First it was seniors that were most affected, then middle age, then back to seniors, now blacks.

First ventilators are the magic cure now they may be killing people.

The bottom line is that even experts know very little about this virus.

When all is said and done, when all the facts are in, we can start to make definitive comments about the virus. 

The only things we know now is tried and true things that work, ie social distance, washing hands etc.

Hopefully when all is in the death toll will be between 30-60k which is a normal toll for a virus type flu.

The tried and true ""cure"" may  have prevented it from being 100k or much greater if the best case scenario comes true."
2020-04-11 14:48:06,"Thanks for these charts.  I have noticed that I haven't seen side by side comparisons of average death rates compared to the current crisis in any of the media.  
Perhaps more people in areas not yet badly effected would understand the severity of the crisis if the stark difference were more front and center."
2020-04-11 12:17:29,"I wonder why for so many of the years, the sharp peak in the middle has ""shoulders""; there's a little peak in what, October? then a decrease, then the big peak, then it happens again, a little peak in March-April."
2020-04-11 13:33:54,"Am I the only one who is a little surprised at how small the increase in the death rate has been? Given the media coverage and the estimates of the experts, I assumed that there would be 6 or 8 times the average number of deaths."
2020-04-10 21:01:45,"It's OK, Trump has now revised down the expected US death toll from COVID19 to fewer than 100,000.  Either he has another 'miracle cure' up his sleeve, or we will expect to see systematic under-reporting from now on."
2020-04-11 15:12:42,"Excess deaths in NY are clearly much, much higher than normal. But what about the rest of the country? Might it be worth considering putting a strict quarantine in place for the NY metro area, and following a different policy of containment and contact tracing for the rest of the country? Pushing the entire country into a deep recession due to containment mistakes (CDC testing problems, Mayor and Governor early statements) seems like poor benefit-cost analysis."
2020-04-11 15:23:11,"Globally the death rate based on the published infection rate is about 6%. Probably the actual infection rate is much higher than the published one. If true then the death rate is lower that the current 6%.

So many questions yet to be answered.  Some of those who have died from a COVD infection would have died from flu or similar in a normal year. Our social distancing should greatly lower the transmission of flu and other viruses. Our rate of flu infection should be at record low numbers compared to a normal year."
2020-04-11 15:27:49,"""These numbers contradict the notion that many people who are dying from the new virus would have died shortly anyway.""

No it doesn't, because people who die today can't die tomorrow. 

They're showing a spike in the present, but there should also be a dip in the future. We don't know yet."
2020-04-11 16:49:42,"Well, it is a new disease, so more deaths than usual are expected.  But only after we see annual numbers, and even longer trend lines over a decade will we see how much of a blip it is.  Death comes for us all, and nobody wishes early death on others.  Effective planning and action could have kept the counts much lower in NYC, as we can see in places like South Korea, Japan and others that have contained matters so much better."
2020-04-11 20:32:26,"Every year for the longest time in the winter I wear a mask 3M 2091 when ask I tell them I have a cold and I'm willing to share it. This time as the world went from maskless to looking like me I'm not a freak anymore. Being of that older generation we are at risk of getting the flu that will even without underlining conditions kill us off. If I really want to scare people I can wear my gas mask with its side filters and have an O2 line running into it.
Looking back just a few months and seeing China lockdown Wuhan and those foreigners fleeing that city going back home to their countries bringing what ever they caught and the world not stopping them. 
I wonder if China has a problem would not those so infected bring that problem back home. 
Which they did.
There is a book by David L. Heymann can add another chapter to it about this new type of flu. How fast it spread and how it was spread. Why the world was caught again off guard and why it will happen again in the not so near future."
2020-04-12 16:22:27,"I've looked at the CDC websites, and downloaded the xls file from the Coronavirus dashboard. I can see why your figure shows no data for 2020 (it's not in FluView), but can't see where you got your month-ending-April 4 data from-- the dashboard agglomerates all deaths from February 1 to April 4. Could you please expand your methodology section."
2020-04-13 05:39:22,"I must admit I have at times been a little skeptical of some of the arm chair numbers passed around describing this pandemic. This is the clearest data that I have seen so far demonstrating that something big is happening, though it may not be as big as 3-10% of the population dying as we feared a few months back. We are still missing key data on how widespread the exposure to the virus has been. Have 1% of the residents of NYC been exposed or 50%. I would think this would be an important thing to know!"
2020-04-13 06:00:23,"April 4th is not the end of a month.  They carved out a 31 day segment which happened to be bad and compared it to other calendar months.  The numbers for just the month of March, or eventually just April, would be relevant and interesting but this is not."
2020-04-13 14:10:38,"This article is monumental.  It shows the tip of the iceberg in the underreporting of COVID-19 deaths.  We need to expand this analysis to include all states and countries.  The enormity of the deaths is staggering.
I would then tackle economic impacts which will be harder to track but it could be done, Consumer spending, savings & 401K balances (which would include stock market losses), etc."
2020-04-13 14:18:07,"In that comprehensive COVID testing is not part of the analysis, the numbers are only suggestive, not authoritative. Like China, COVID is displacing other medical interventions in our country. In the absence of such care, there will be fatalities for other causes as well. Even when COVID by itself has not overwhelmed our facilities, it has overwhelmed the treatment of other medical conditions."
2020-04-13 15:09:57,"I, and friends of mine, have speculated that there will be a rise in deaths attributable to heart disease, cancer, and other preventable or manageable diseases simply because of deferred routine medical visits due to general anxieties among the population about seeing any medical professional in person.  Moreover, as people lose their jobs and their health insurance, they are going to be very reluctant to take on any out of pocket medical expenses unless it is an immediate life and death crisis. And finally, medical professionals themselves may be forced to forego regular routine appointments due to limitations of time and resources due to the pandemic.  I’d hate to try to get an appointment with a pulmonologist in New York right now!  

And last but not perhaps not least, we really have no idea what lasting damage the Covid-19 virus will leave physiologically.  Perhaps permanent pulmonary impairment among others that will again over time lead to premature deaths."
2020-04-13 15:38:14,"Complicated. How do those already with little hope stay positive when all hope is removed? How do they sleep and stay with the regular routine with added stress of loneliness and feelings of impending doom?

When someone lives out the days clinging to hope of x% chances of survival over y number of years, and then that x% is crushed by a factor of many ... psychology alone can be many times more powerful than all other complications combined."
2020-04-13 15:48:20,"I'm not understanding your logic and your conclusions... Are the Covid19 patients (read deaths) being tested for influenza, bacterial superinfections, nosocomial infections, CV disease? Highly unlikely (and from personal experience in hospitals doubtful). The federal government was promising 4 million masks in March 11th and still hasn't come through. The tests and tests kits AND their associated, what's called ""testing characteristics,"" are all over the map in their manufacturing and quality. Thus making testing results poor; and shattering conclusions from bad data. 

Perhaps this virus, like others in the past, just sped up the likely and unfortunate deaths of elderly folks; and the intense societal stress overwhelms immune systems, including overworked young doctors and others. It's a human fantasy that medicine or science can cure death... and the randomness of life means some immune systems will fend this new virus off and others will not.

Finally, the awareness of the danger has likely led to hypersensitivity in people in poor health with symptoms  (read vague symptoms of Corona that are true for other diseases) and activated them to get to the hospital, thus all diseases are up..."
2020-04-13 16:09:37,"I'd be really interested in similar data sets for the states.  

In particular, I keep looking at the Florida Covid numbers and find them deeply suspicious."
2020-04-13 15:31:56,"While the deaths may be coming faster than usual, it still isn't very many in the big scheme of things with humans grossly overpopulated and destroying the planet at a frenetic rate.  What it does reveal, though, is how privatization of medical care, and other infrastructure, has left out country threadbare of necessary supportability in crisis.

It is also clear that the halting of the economy to save a few tens of thousands of deaths (heart disease alone kills over 600K Americans each year in contrast) is flat out stupid."
2020-04-13 14:47:18,Why aren't they testing people who die at home for covid-19?
2020-04-13 15:55:40,"Will the Times be revisiting this chart with prominent placement in the months and years that follow?

It is likely that after the worst of the crisis passes, the death rate will be statistically significantly *lower* for a few years after. This is because victims of this tragedy are concentrated in cohorts that have high expected death rates over the five year horizon.

A countervailing factor might be that we witness additional deaths due to people currently not getting treatment and diagnosis for non-COVID-19 health issues currently."
2020-04-13 13:08:03,"Compare the number of virus deaths with those of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars.

More importantly, compare the taxpayer costs of those wars, with the budget for combatting a viral invastion.

Boeing and Raytheon received a ton more money fighting fake military threats than scientists studying real health threats."
2020-04-13 15:16:58,"The article and caption indicate data lags for 10 days, yet the charts have NO DATA FOR ALL OF 2019. 
How can there be no death certificate data available from NYC for an entire year?
That said, we need to analyze the covid death data with a microscope. 
What was the social, economic, legal status, conviction status, etc. of each deceased, in addition to any comorbidities, age, gender, etc. 
The public policy for hospitalization /ER  medical care was touted as being something you shouldn’t seek out unless and until you had symptoms for covid and a doctor told you to come in. 
Even the field hospitals (Javits and USNS Comfort) were for non-covid overflow and you had to be vetted at a covid-laden hospital first. 
You could not present with a serious non-covid symptom for treatment at these 1,000 bed facilities. 
Hospitals were ordered to increase their capacity by at least 50%, so elective procedures and surgical suites became covid wards. 
The message was clear: If you don’t have covid, we are not a place for treatment, and if you didn’t have covid when you got here, you would almost certainly get it, like medical providers. 
People were / are waiting for the curve to flatten and be told that hospitals can and will treat them for non-covid SAFELY."
2020-04-13 05:59:56,"These are very interesting data! Typically about 4k deaths per month in NYC, an excess is due to the virus.

they predicted numbers will be updated later today and probably increased, because they underestimated the last two days. To answer the question addressed in this article (those who died already would die shortly after anyway) one really needs to wait for the data after the pandemics is over. Will the average number of deaths per month be smaller than 4k then? We shall see..."
2020-04-12 03:17:50,"The average numbers before the virus came don't seem right.   The overall US death rate is .92% per year.   If you apply that rate to NYC, with a population of 8.4 million people, you would expect about 6500 deaths a month.   The chart shows between 4000 and 6000.   

Is the population of NYC that much younger and healthier than the country as a whole?   You're showing an average death rate before the virus of about .68%, which seems very low.  Maybe everybody moves to the suburbs when they get married?"

2020-04-10 15:25:58,"I'm a devout atheist. One of the (many) things that disturbs and enrages me about organized religion and their leaders is the endemic hyprocrisy: almost no one practices what they preach (especially GOP evangelicals and their unwillingness to help the poor and needy; Joel Osteen and the other millionaire megachurch preachers, who are more concerned about their private jets than their flock; the rampant sexual abuse of children in the Catholic church and they way it is swept under the carpet; the unfair and abusive treatment of women in extremist Muslim and Orthodox Jewish sects; and so on, and so on--the list of such examples is endless).

However! The Amish always seem to practice what they preach. When people need help--in their own community or outside of it--they help. They work incredibly hard; they are not materialistic and obsessed with money; and they seem to derive real joy and peace within their religion and communities. They pay taxes and don't accept federal benefits, unlike all the other US religious groups. I'm sure there are abuses in some of their communities (as there are in *any* group of human beings who form a society, no matter how lofty or sincere the collective ideals of that group are), but whenever I read about the Amish in the news or elsewhere, I'm always impressed by the way they sincerely and willingly try to live up to their ideals. I found this particular article extraordinarily moving, and am grateful to them for their kind and generous help."

2020-04-10 18:37:47,"@IndyM 

You're giving us the Harrison Ford film, ""Witness"" version of the Amish.

Their patriarchy has been enforced with physical beatings, and more.   This part of Ohio is notorious for puppy mills with the most horrendous conditions for the animals.   In the past 20 years there have been internecine conflicts over financial matters executed by capitalist intermediaries.   One group manhandled the other, cut off their beards, and the case ended up in federal court in Youngstown.

The Amish as peaceful men and women of the good earth is an erroneous stereotype.

Nonetheless, I believe this story reflects the good in their community.   And there is a lot of good.

This area has a wonderful basketball heritage.   The Amish don't participate in school or play, but their cousins and friends do.

They had a guy who tried out with the Knicks, who had he gone to something other than divinity school, would have made it with his Larry Bird passing skills.   They had another guy who was an Ohio State captain.   A power forward was linebacker for the Seahawks.

""we can come in here and do something for somebody else who’s in need and do it right at home here, and do it safely,” Mr. Raber said, instead of “taking handouts.” 

There was a Junior Raber who led Berlin Hiland High School to the Ohio championship.   He did for Amish Country what LeBron James did for Akron."

I know the Clovid-19 has been hard on them economically but there are many of us who’ve lost our income and yet we have taken to sewing masks alone in our homes on a voluntary basis. Personally, I have been sewing nearly nonstop for 3 wks now. There are so many people sewing masks for free that it is impossible to find elastic or thread in any of the essential stores that remain open. Alone, i have spent $150 on fabric and other materials, not including postage to mail them to their respective coordinator’s location.

Right now we are heading into the new world order. Whether you believe it or not the world and this country is never going to be the same. These people live a very simple life and exist because of their faith and their long history of how they live. I've often said to myself when the world spins out of control i want to live in harmony the way they live. These folks have never lived out of balance and so they will survive when the rest of the world will be killing each other for a roll of T.P. Now the Mighty World renowned Cleveland clinic has asked for their help. I find it very interesting that they didn't call the super power communist and socialist Evil China. Instead they called little Sugar creek Ohio. The Amish can and are willing to roll up their sleeves and work for our safety. I find it very interesting that modern man can and does destroy the world and the Amish can help solve a major problem with just a simple face mask.

2020-04-09 17:21:32,"Every night in my tiny neighborhood, the music starts at 5:30.  Slowly people come out onto porches or lawns and start dancing.  Four songs.  15 minutes.  All ages.  Something to connect us in this time of distance.  It keeps us going."
2020-04-09 17:46:40,I gladly do this each evening to honor the courageous health care workers who are giving so much of themselves. Living in TriBeCa I fear I am only annoying the two or three plastic surgeons that remain.
2020-04-09 18:22:40,"This ritual—really, a sort of nondenominational or secular prayer—brings consolation and joy by allowing us to do something together.  As the author says,

“Thanking health care workers may be the point of this act, but its delights lie beside the point. The Clapping is a communal outburst. It is a reminder that though we are isolated, we are not alone.”

Some say this doesn’t help health care workers.  But for most of us, all we can do to assist those on the front line is to stay home.  And if this daily five-minute eases our sense of isolation, and helps keep people home, well, that’s a good thing."
2020-04-09 18:24:16,"Frontline healthcare provider here. Save your clapping and, if you really value what we’re doing for America, push the government to provide us with some student loan forgiveness. I say that having paid off my student loans from both nursing and graduate school."
2020-04-09 18:38:46,"In Jackson Heights, described here in the Times as the “epicenter of the epicenter” the clapping brings us together and allows us a sense of solidarity and empowerment for a few moments at the end of each day. It’s a language unto itself that helps us to communicate and feel connected. So far we have noticed that each night more and more of people participate."
2020-04-09 18:52:18,Thanks yet again Amanda for a wonderful and astute piece of brilliance. PB
2020-04-09 18:59:25,"Our Bay Area suburb howls at 8pm. The local dogs and coyotes join in. It may have started as an appreciation for health care workers like me, but if so I wasn’t aware of it. It’s more of a primal scream. It’s a release of frustration, fear, and uncertainty, yes, but it’s also a moment of community solidarity that reminds us we’re all still here. Separated, but howling together."
2020-04-09 19:25:58,"This is so heartwarming, thanks!"
2020-04-09 19:38:01,"We are hunkered down with a 6-year old in an apartment in the Village. When he's not (reluctantly) absorbing some of the lessons we're trying to impart, he can play with his Lego collection, watch endless movies on Netflix and Disney, and do whatever he does on our iPad. But without a doubt, the highlight of his day is clapping, whistling, and banging at 7pm every day (he's usually counting down by 6:30pm). It seems that this vital connection to a greater community is what keeps him from losing his (and our) sanity. And perhaps being grateful for the service and sacrifice of others is the most important lesson he can learn."
2020-04-09 19:42:30,i live a block from Lenox Hill and at 7 its absolute pandemonium here for 5 min.  I look forward to it every evening!
2020-04-09 19:48:55,"We in the North Loop, Minneapolis, are stating the same ritual. Recognized in today's (Thursday) StarTribune. They even mentioned my banjo playing the first night for our building. I know that the first responders, et al. would prefer something less symbolic. We are doing a bit of virtue signaling, but I think we are working to accomplish more concrete goals at the same time."
2020-04-09 19:59:44,"I'm one physician who finds it depressing.  Well-intentioned, but so classically human in its commitment to a gesture without evidence of commitment to anything actually pragmatic, and does not suggest to me any particular progress in figuring out for the long term any of the issues around health care that actually frustrate me and my patients.  Prove me wrong -- If you've participated in the clapping, you damn well be on the front lines the next time big picture issues like working to a more equitable access to health care are on the front page."
2020-04-09 17:04:43,I love showing my support to all essential workers at 7pm every night here in NYC. BUT (shhh) my dirty secret is I also get my ya yas out by banging a pot with a wooden spoon. A win-win.
2020-04-09 16:41:13,First article from the NY Times Iv enjoyed in the last 3 years!
2020-04-09 19:46:15,"Maybe I'm a total Grinch but the clapping is really starting to grate. Especially given all the people in my neighborhood who I see ordering instacart, and freshdirect, and generally taking advantage of the essential workers (just like they do all the time). Maybe every single one of them has given money to support people, and tipped $20 every time someone graciously delivers something...but somehow I doubt it. Here's a rule I'd like to implement: if you want to clap and you have the money to give, you must give it. Even  if it's $1 for each time you clap. I can't get behind armchair activism from people in 8 million dollar brownstones whose underpaid nannies are still coming to work."
2020-04-09 16:36:18,"Yes, we clap again tonight, every night!"
2020-04-09 17:33:27,"We’ve been doing this in France for awhile now. The other night it coincided with the garbage collectors, so we cheered even louder. Then one of them said, in English, “Thank you... Thank you very much,” with a little Elvis twang, and off they drove, beeping and flashing their lights."
2020-04-09 20:26:37,"After her excellent expose of a women's health/social club as hypocritical and elitist, I have watched for Ms. Hess's byline. This is an excellent article. 

No, clapping does not accomplish as much as buying supplies for frontline workers, which I also do, but who, other than stuck up Ayn Rand-reading CEO types, does not believe that employees work not only happier, but harder after receiving praise?

And if the clappers feel they are fighting back by doing so--or simply enjoy it, what's the harm?"
2020-04-09 20:27:48,"Yes! This is the only thing truly scheduled on my calendar that we all look forward to. We love seeing our neighbors come out on their terraces or in their windows with pots/pans/cowbells/loud whistles and claps. 
While nice, I hope this brings attention that people who are out there NOW deserve much more money than they were getting paid."
2020-04-09 21:19:49,"We're doing it at my condo here in Alexandria, VA as well, in honor of both the workers on the front lines in many fields, and our own wonderful employees. I love it!"
2020-04-09 21:51:25,"My neighbourhood, where most of us are lonely and afraid, do it precisely at 7 p.m.  It is comforting to know that this misery is being shared with others, but more importantly, that we are all still alive."
2020-04-09 22:09:28,"At Northside Piers in Brooklyn, crowds of people pour out into the street and into the piers hollering at 7 pm. It’s a nice gesture but I wish they would wear masks."
2020-04-09 22:15:17,"Yes, I know it's supposed to be for essential workers. But I do it because I love seeing my neighbors here in Hell's Kitchen and waving and yelling together. Our lives have become so much smaller; we are constrained to our tiny apartments and many of us rarely step outside. We are isolated. The mental health issues are real. 7pm is a way that we can be big together and shed an iota of our sadness, and share in some form of public life. 

To the essential workers who think it's silly -- of course no one expects that it will change policy or structural issues. I am sure that many of us have donated where we can. The next crisis may see other types of work as essential. We all have a role to play."
2020-04-09 22:15:53,"I love 7 pm.  To be honest, it's become the only thing on my once-busy calendar and I truly look forward to joining in with people I don't know from the co-ops and condos in the neighborhood and yelling and clapping.  Yes, it's for the health care workers, but it's also for the bus drivers who flash their lights for us, the delivery guys on their bicycles who sometimes wave - and for us.  We're all doing our part by staying inside so you can live.  Give a cheer for us!"
2020-04-09 22:16:27,"As fyi, the time of 7 pm was initially planned to coincide with the shift changes at most hospitals when workers would be be coming and going and, thus, more likely to hear the clapping and cheering.  As a resident of the Upper East side who has friends toiling in the hospitals throughout the city, they do hear it and are emotionally hit by it.   Grateful for such a simple gesture.  To those saying that more significant things should be done to help these medical workers (and all other essential workers) - we can agree.  However the two things are not mutually exclusive.   We can still clap and cheer and bang pots to thank them - as well as fight for better pay, adequate supplies, better accessible healthcare for all, etc. etc. etc.

So now excuse me, I need to grab my ladle and pot to be ready to join my neighborhood community in our nightly  gesture of gratefulness to others."
2020-04-09 23:45:20,"We are clapping in downtown Portland as well. What started out as about 10 neighbors has now become 30 or more, from what I can tell! And I see more and more people purposely walking past our building at that time with instruments and dogs everyday. I love 7 o’clock so much, wishing everyone the best."
2020-04-09 23:58:42,"My husband & I do this now, daily, from the rooftop of our condo building in LIC. As the days get longer, we can hear and see more & more locals joining-in on the delicious cacophony. It is so healing we are moved to tears every time. I hope all the medical workers and EMT's and traffic cops and FDNY, NYPD, transit workers, deliverymen (etc.etc.) can hear us and know the applause and whoops are a heartfelt THANK YOU to them."
2020-04-10 00:16:00,"I’ll take Italy’s way any day. Beautiful music that actually soothes the soul, rather than a senseless auditory assault. Outside my windows it sounds like those participating are all young people coming home from a drunken Saturday night, literally screaming at the top of their lungs. If at least they used some words, like in Network:  “we’re not going to take this anymore,”"
2020-04-09 20:56:57,"In Mill Valley, Marin, CA, residents step outside and howl at the moon at 8 PM!"
2020-04-09 21:13:11,"Interesting.  My neighborhood has gotten quiet rather than loud.  The hookers have pretty much all disappeared which means no ladies screaming over who owns the corner on Friday night.  

Other than that, folks have been gathering outside on the street between the two buildings at night to light up a bowl and knock back a can of Olympia beer."
2020-04-10 00:31:23,"Happy clappers.

The Brits started it first..why did the author not know that?"
2020-04-09 21:10:41,"We all have to love each other right now.

Just that."
2020-04-09 22:10:11,"Some here howl or scream. They are blowing off steam. But respectfully I'd like you all to consider that your noise might be scary and overwhelming to your neighbors, especially children,  who have no idea what you're doing or why."
2020-04-09 20:25:09,"here in topanga, we howl (like our canyon' coyotes) !  it's moving and exciting!"
2020-04-09 20:16:46,"I think these evening “Noise-Offs”  (because it’s not just clapping) are great!  Not just as expressions of appreciation for the soul- and body-draining work of the medical community, but as a life-affirming “We are here!  We are here”!  (I don’t think the good Doctor nor Horton would mind my borrowing the phrase.)"
2020-04-09 22:10:31,"Embracing the adage to ""bloom where you're planted"", every evening 7:30ish, I hang my speakers out of my studio window, turn the volume up to 11 :-) and play Leonard Cohen’s Hallelujah sung by the Reodean School. Coupling that with turning on all the outdoor lights, I feel hope-filled."
2020-04-09 21:40:54,"If this is ""the highlight of your day"" during this crisis, then you must know it's an activity that is not available to everyone. Many people live in isolated areas or in suburbs that feel depopulated."
2020-04-09 22:04:10,"In our hilltop neighborhood in South Lake Tahoe, we all, at 8 pm sharp, are Howling for Healthcare workers.  Every night.  The kids and the dogs join in and recently, so did the coyotes, literally.  Gotta stick together.  We are."
2020-04-10 02:18:03,"in my washington heights neighborhood, The Clapping has grown louder with each passing day. my kids (5 and 2.5) await The Clapping. it's part of our new routine, and a beloved one - flinging open the window to bangon the radiators, clap blocks, and yell ""thank you to our doctors and nurses!"" we see neighbors in buildings across the street - an older woman with bright yellow maracas; a mom with two girls who wave a shy hello and bang pots with wooden spoons; a young man who has shouts hello to the kids; a man across the way with a vuvuzuela that ends The Clapping by blasting ""New York, New York."" 
maybe it is ""clapping at the sky,"" but it's also clapping in recognition of and gratitude for, the terrors witnessed by medical personnel and others who guard our health and well-being while we live our socially distanced lives, and for us, too, who miss a bustling city and its bursts of unsyncopated noise."
2020-04-10 03:39:37,"The Children's museum across from my apartment used to be an almost irritating source of endless noise and idling engings. now I only hear the sirens.  At 7pm I join the clapping because I mean to honor all those working out there, in hospitals or on bikes.
 
Those lacking in imagination may not see the practicality of the matter but I feel that it's our way to restart the great engine of this city, revving it during this long pause. We're making sure that the spirit of this city is still here. 

The fresh breeze energizes me as I wave at my anonymous neighbors and I sometimes worry when they don't show up. Are they ill? Are they depressed? When they do show up, I enjoy seeing them enjoy the moment."
2020-04-10 04:51:52,Somebody who actually is a frontline worker asked us to make the clapping a one time thing. Apparently some of them who work odd shifts are trying to sleep at that hour and don't actually appreciate being wakened night after night to be thanked.
2020-04-10 01:58:47,But can you do the ice bucket and clap at the same time?
2020-04-10 03:17:16,"New York City is the great love of my life. In sickness, and in health.

“Even the bad is beautiful.”
— Alice Herz-Sommer"
2020-04-10 05:06:09,"Looking out the window of my old building in what's now Hudson Yards, you'd be forgiven for thinking the neighborhood is actually empty. Then 7 comes, and *listening* out the window tells a whole different story. We're still here! And boy can we raise a ruckus. :)"
2020-04-10 09:50:33,Clapping is very commendable and doubtless therapeutic. How about paying these people a decent wage and honouring their work-- pandemic or no pandemic?
2020-04-10 11:45:11,"Thank you, Amanda, for this wonderful read. I wasn't aware of the clapping in NY. It sounds wonderful. Something to look forward to, as you write."
2020-04-10 12:03:50,"We are on NY’s Upper East Side. Every night at 7:00, people across the street bring 3 speakers out onto the roof and play a song or two. Along with clapping and cheering, it is very uplifting. Our daughters, all living in the suburbs, await to hear what songs are played each night."
2020-04-10 12:47:48,"Thank you, Amanda, for a wonderful, uplifting article.  I loved that you gave credit to the credits because they would have to find something else to criticize if not for the unified clapping.  Here we have colorful lights outside and teddy bears and zoo animal pictures carefully placed on windows, a group who gathered in their vehicles Wednesday night to circle Heritage Valley Hospital to thank all there by honking horns and joyfully yelling their thanks, and generous souls giving others food to those in need.  Please keep writing your words of wisdom and inspiration!"
2020-04-10 14:50:16,"I live in the West 50's and every night at 7, I, too, open my window.  Before I join in the clapping and noise making, I first listen for a minute....just listen...to the cheers of my fellow New Yorkers reverberating and bouncing off the surrounding buildings.  And every single night, it brings tears to my eyes.  And every single night at 7:05pm, my friend Linda, who lives a few blocks away, calls me to tell me she's tearing up too.  This new nightly ritual not only reminds me of the extraordinary job the essential workers in this city are doing, but it also makes me feel connected to everyone else holed up in their apartments.  I can't see them but I can hear them loud and clear.  It's kind of like an anonymous block party, no social distancing required.  I love New York!"
2020-04-10 15:48:42,"Great article - we are clapping and hollering in LA too, and its growing thru the neighborhood every day! A strong community moment!"
2020-04-10 16:20:21,"I, too, find the ritual extremely important here in Granada, Spain. We are on Day 27 of our official lockdown. The nightly clapping is still loud and strong, and helps us feel connected by reminding us that we are it together."
2020-04-10 17:04:40,I live in Seattle and we have a similar routine at 8pm every night. It's the highlight of my day (big time). My partner and I grab wooden spoons and pots and join our neighborly chorus for a few minutes. The same folks pop out of their apartments each evening and one neighbor just sticks their hands out the window and claps. I love the routine of it - the community feeling - and celebrating something important during these trying times.
2020-04-10 13:52:58,"Here in Rego Park, near the epicenter of the epicenter, the nightly 7 PM clapping and banging not only supports those on the front lines but also brings smiles as we get together with our neighbors.  People, as the song goes, need people and this is our once-a-day gathering.  I never thought that I would look forward to the day when I can once again pile into a crowded subway car."
2020-04-10 12:52:40,"So true, feeling uplifted together is enough to make this an important act. I’ll be continuing to clap to the sky!!!"
2020-04-10 00:08:28,"I'll quote from a doctor who wrote the following in the Times:

""Like many internet movements, the idea is misguided. It is a salve only to those who are already hiding in their dens stocked up for winter. A perfect activity for the internet age, it’s a low-investment, risk-free way to wear the mantle of the moment without owning it.""

I would bet that most clappers, like Hess, are not from here. Clapping into a void just isn't a New York move -- ultimately, it's self-centered and about affirming one's own virtue rather than helping others. It's telling that this is all the product of a marketing firm. If you need it to feel better about yourself, go ahead. But don't try to convince yourself that you are doing something useful."
2020-04-08 13:43:35,"In the opening to the book ""Signal and the Noise"" (by the 538 guy), he talks about the times we live in now and comparable periods in history when the amount of information we have at our fingertips radically increased.  One of these periods was the invention of the printing press, and the first thing printed en mass was the bible.  The net result he pointed out was 300 years of religious wars in Europe.

The internet today gives us the same chances, and conspiracy theories flourish thanks to the explosion in technology.  Just because we have more information and data isn't always better.  We largely pay attention only to the facts that make us feel better and prove out one of our own cooked up theories."
2020-04-08 14:00:48,"There are also conspiracy facts.  The Chinese conspired to cover up the start of the Pandemic and the Person to Person spread including direct interaction with the whistle blowers.  It also appears they deliberately understated the numbers to the rest of the world, all of which limited our ability to respond and diminished the magnitude of the response.

It also seems a conspiracy fact that the W.H.O. has favored China in its characterize of the covid-19 and exclusion of Taiwan from the W.H.O.  Below is a W.H.O. link about lack of evidence of person to person spread.

Working with a communist country has many hidden costs that don't show up on the same balance sheet as low cost production and saving a dollar or two ar Walmart.

There is a cost to Freedom of speech in terms of economic influence to suppress anti China tweets and movie content.  There is any impact on the W. H. O.  When we buy a Made In China product we fund the CCP and its military which means we must increase spending on our own.  We find the censorship and detainment of doctor Ai Fen, the social scoring system. and ""vocational training"" camps for a religious minority.  We fund a system that continues to tolerate wet markets after SARS, then covered up and minimized the Pandemic it created as its citizens spread the infection through international travel.

How can we continue commerce with China thus funding its government and all it does."
2020-04-08 14:23:03,"The one conspiracy that is front, center and evident is the conspiracy of Trump, his family, his appointees, his Republican senatorial majority, and now, even the Supreme Court to subvert the ideals of equality, justice, decency – and even the basic tenets of democracy – in America."
2020-04-08 13:47:34,The only theory worth checking is why Trump kept calling this a hoax when he was informed of the danger in December and January. He should be held accountable.
2020-04-08 14:07:37,"Of course, then there’s the claim that Nancy Pelosi and other liberal democrats released COVID 19 as a plot to make Trump lose the election. In the area I’m living in, that claim has gained some traction. Of course, that claim is actually true. Obviously."
2020-04-08 13:41:36,"Actual Republican conduct in the context of the Wisconsin primary yesterday provides factual support for the conclusion that coronavirus benefits Republicans—or at least that the Republicans think that it does. This Republican view also disproves the paranoid theory that Democrats like covid-19 because it undercuts Trump. If the Republicans think that the virus benefits their party, how can the Dems be behind it as part of a conspiracy to undercut Trump?

Speaking of conspiracies, the Wisconsin Republicans made a serious mistake in requiring that the election go ahead yesterday. They should have postponed it, setting a precedent for Trump to cite when he tries to cancel the election in November, something I can see him attempting if he thinks he might lose."
2020-04-08 13:39:10,"People create conspiracy theories for the same reason they create gods: to inject order into chaos.   The thought that we are on a spinning rock alone in the universe, with no control over the future, is terrifying to the human mind.   For those unwilling to accept the randomness of our existence, an orderly, purposeful Illuminati that is responsible for all the world's misery is preferable."
2020-04-08 14:46:58,"We know that it came from a bat and it came from China. That's all we know for certain.

The UN and WHO need to convene a special forum on this topic. They need to address the world about how this started and what is being done to prevent it from ever happening again. China just passed laws aimed at preventing it from happening again but they supposedly did the same after SARS.

This needs to become topic number one for activism. As big as climate change. The anger his only beginning but in the next few weeks and months you will see people the world over revolting over how this was allowed to happen. 

We know where it came from and we have strong suspensions about how it started. There were warnings for years. This needs to talked about publicly. The public has to be informed so they will understand how this happened ...Otherwise."
2020-04-08 13:59:42,"Steve Bannon started it, and set up China to take the fall. The Mercers are ecstatic. No, its human nature to create an enemy when any tragedy occurs. We would rather have an evidence agenda than be exposed to an uncertain world."
2020-04-08 14:48:54,"The author states this country is at risk of permanently alienating the people’s public trust. I suggest we have passed that point. Our system was already broken and being picked apart by Trump before this pandemic. Now it has collapsed and we are headed for a plutocracy. I have lost the last vestiges if my faith in the US government and our country overall. This fiasco has laid bare the dark underbelly of the US system and I am horrified and alienated. I am exhausted from these years suffering under Trump’s chaos and mental illness, and I can’t see any hope for repairing our three-branch system, except a civil war. Rather than expending energy trying to understand what’s going on here, I now focus on searching for a country where I can apply for asylum as a political refugee."
2020-04-08 14:38:23,"The primary role of the free press is to get the facts out consistently. This is our national vaccine against disinformation, conspiracy theories, etc.  What can render this most valuable of vaccines impotent is allowing “opinion” to creep into news reporting and not keeping it quarantined to the opinion page."
2020-04-08 14:57:56,"I have had my own ""conspiracy theory"" from the day this coronavirus hit the US but it is not about the origins of the virus.  I can't help thinking that Trump's surprise visit to the Walter Reed military hospital on November 18, 2019 shortly after he made an extended visit to China had nothing to do with getting a head start on his annual check-up and everything with his advance warning of a potential outbreak and making sure he did not have it. ABC's report today that intelligence knew as early as late November only reinforces my ""conspiracy theory"" that Trump knew as early as November, too, and remained silent for fear it would affect the economy and his chances of being reelected."
2020-04-08 14:58:50,"Yesterday I watched a news program in France, BFM tv.  One of the top Dr's in France was pushing for the medicine hydroxychloroquine to be used because he heard from China that it worked.  He also said there were no side effects.  Of course, that's not true but they let him go on and on. 
It is so shameful that they did not let anyone challenge him."
2020-04-08 14:59:50,"Just give us truthful,factual and useful information. That’s it.

Senator Cotton, Donald Trump and other government officials should be brought to task for their part in encouraging these conspiracy theories. They know better. But their constituents often do not.

However others, those making up these conspiracy theories, those propagating them and those that simply believe them prove that critical thinking skills are a rare commodity during this pandemic. But the lack of critical thinking is certainly not a new phenomena.

During a pandemic, believing some of these theories has proved deadly. Drinking bleach? Swallowing fish tank cleaner? When will people just stop and THINK?

The idiocy is simply frightening."
2020-04-08 13:51:25,"My only conspiracy notion is that despite all the horror and economic suffering so many in the country are and will endure, our President and his shifty brethren are going to scheme and manipulate to profit ""tremendously"" off this.  Politically and monetarily."
2020-04-08 14:26:39,"Framing the pandemic as 'war'  functions as a conspiracy theory; it gives an easy, misleading, and counterproductive explanation. 

Labeling a virus as the enemy provides an emotionally charged 'us vs them' binary. When in fact reasoned analysis leads to the plenitude of nature and the collective nature of society. On every level, we are in it together. 

The virus is opportunistic and adaptive. Our environmental policies, economic practices, and political choices can rein in a a viral outbreak, or as is the case with the corona pandemic, give it free rein. 

Beating the drums for war may be an adept public relations opportunity, it is not an adaptive pandemic response."
2020-04-08 13:37:43,This is such an important and complicated issue.  The author clearly identifies the wellspring from which conspiracy theories rise: fear and a sense of helplessness.
2020-04-08 15:31:49,"Conspiracy theories, snake oil, wrinkle cream all have a common denominator—money and lots of it. Ad revenue’s gonna kill us all and every human brain cell that exists, including mine. Take that from a housewife in Mississippi with a part time job monitoring content on a lil’ol, teeny tiny platform of home grown motion pictures. But don’t tell no one cause I’m pretty sure I’m being watched."
2020-04-08 15:41:42,"Perhaps these theories proliferate because it's easy to imagine this situation helping the extreme left and the extreme right.

It is great for the environment. The air and water is cleaner, the cities are less noisy, fossil fuel use is down and global CO2 levels will quit going up quite as fast.

It requires massive government intervention and it could lead to more of the same after it passes. That can be the helpful kind, like better health care and support for people at the bottom of the economic food chain. After all, it got Trump and his Republicans to support the largest socialist bill (for ordinary people) ever. Why? Because it was absolutely necessary.

But the government intervention could be of the more intrusive kind too. The government has told us to shut down businesses and stay at home. It's not hard to imagine more of the same after it passes. It's big government, and it's here to help, but will it always be so benign? 

The pandemic is a perfect storm, not a conspiracy. However you can expect people to use it support their agendas on the left and the right. I for one think it is an unplanned test run for a more sustainable economy, and for a police state."

Unfortunately, the Internet has given all these folks a chance to amplify their voice and reinforce their fears.

But could the mainstream media have something to do with all this?

After all, isn't it more likely for people to search for answers when they are bombarded daily by doom and gloom stories?
Isn't fear actually quite rational when we are told we ""are at war with an invisible enemy""? Especially when the enemy seems to be winning.

The truth is our media has long ago ceased to strictly adhere to ""fact based"" reporting. There once was a rule that said you have to verify every source with at least another source before reporting it.

Now we have unnamed sources quoting themselves and that suffices for verified ""facts.""

The Mueller investigation was supposed to put the legal stamp of authority on the whole Russia gate conspiracy, which was repeated like a drum beat over and over in the media.

Instead, the whole thing fell apart and no one is doing a post mortar to tell us what the ""facts"" really were.

Hydrochloroquine has in fact been used by doctors as a treatment.  The FDA has specifically approved its off-label use in this manner.  No there has been no extensive double-blind testing (because there hasn't been time) but Trump never said there had been. And no, Trump is not responsible because a couple ingested fish tank cleaner (not an approved drug obviously).  The media's attempt to downplay Hydrochloroquine as a treatment, just to play ""gotcha"" games with Trump is truly reprehensible.

People plan for the future, some of whom for tomorrow, others for the next centuries.  To believe that the people do not successfully conspire is to deny the success of a small group of merchants, physicians, deacons and farmer around Boston the 1770s.

Of course, some plans go horribly wrong.  I am more inclined to believe that a small group selected this SARS-CoV and expected it to resemble the first 2003 outbreak, and little did they understand its remarkable contagiousness.  While this not to say that it was, or was not but there are too many consequences to dismiss the possibility outright.

The Scripps analysis that it did not seem to be engineered is useful.  But it need not have been synthetically-created, but could have been selected from natural mutations by well-known protocols.

A second and perhaps more sinister contributor is that other races, predominantly white, are availing themselves to yet unproven treatments such as hydroxychloroquine while certain media outlets, CNN, MSNBC and urban radio are warning their listeners of potentially dire risks to taking the drug. Many blacks may be rejecting physician recommendations to take the drug to there peril. There is no fire of proof but there is the smoke of possibility.

It's one of the deadliest crisis in current human history and repercussions will go beyond imagination quite comparable to nuclear war or ferocious melting of Arctic ice.

And in America, if the government had been open and had more transparency all along, people wouldn't be as likely to theorize conspiracy. In America, the death of democracy happened when the original rich Senators (you had to be wealthy to be in the Senate) made sure that bankers would always come out richer than the rest of us through the fractional reserve system.

Trump, on the other hand, wants to downplay COVID-19 and protect himself politically by not ruining the economy. He's also the socioemotional equivalent of a tween. The reality of the situation is clearly somewhere between Trump and the media's presentation, and that's why people are looking directly at the statistics and reading medical experts articles to try and get a general sense of what is really going on.

Effects include increased cancer risk, cellular stress, increase in harmful free radicals, genetic damages, structural and functional changes of the reproductive system, learning and memory deficits, neurological disorders, and negative impacts on general well-being in humans. Damage goes well beyond the human race, as there is growing evidence of harmful effects to both plant and animal life.”

As to Trump's saying people were stealing masks, he was only repeating what Governor Cuomo had already asserted. Governor Cuomo about masks being stolen as reported on CNBC March 6, 2020: “Not just people taking a couple or three, I mean just actual thefts of those products.

This differs from a critical inclination to figure out what seems most plausible, even if it doesn't align with the received wisdom.

To illustrate, Fisher ridicules the idea that ""the virus is a foreign bioweapon"" as an example of ""patently unbelievable claims"" spread by ""everyday people whose critical faculties have simply been overwhelmed."" Those poor people. Yet it appears that description may best fit Fisher himself.

If Fisher had been thinking critically -- if this article had been intended as something other than a chant for true believers to share -- he might have inquired more carefully into Senator Cotton's questions, instead of dismissing them with an initially mistaken notion of their contents.

Specifically, must a virus be engineered in order to be a bioweapon? Obviously not. Anthrax, for instance, does not require engineering.

In that case, did a Chinese virologist locate SARS-CoV-2 in nature and preserve a sample in the Wuhan laboratory, which does study coronaviruses? Will China allow international inspectors to determine whether such a sample could have escaped from that lab?

About such matters, Fisher doesn't know, nor does he care. His is a reassuring message: we must pity the tinhat people who would ask such questions. We know better. We know that the virus reached humans through a mystery animal. No further inquiry is desired."

That is not conspiracy, that is fact. 

People witness how the wealthy and privileged Americans who get infected with Covid are treated with anti-malaria and HIV medications and how they recover completely, while their government tells them those same drugs are ""unproven,"" and should not be used for themselves; that they should take cough medicine and stay home untreated. Why should such hypocrisy inspire confidence?

When the American government and its caste-based healthcare system show unequal respect for the diginity of the people's lives, why should they trust it?

For 100 years people have watched images of doctors in infectious disease situations use masks while the US Surgeon General tells them that ""masks are NOT effective"" in helping to prevent being infected. Yet at the same time, the Surgeon General tells them that masks help prevent ""healthcare providers"" from being infected. Go figure.

And you ask why public ""trust"" is eroding. And you discredit all the conclusions and hypotheses of the people (even those that are based on evidence, observation and logic) as ""conspiracy.""

2020-04-08 14:39:58,"To find the animal hosts for the coronavirus, the Chinese government undertook and continues to pursue what is perhaps the most exhaustive search in history. They interviewed the people who worked at the wet market in Wuhan where the outbreak was thought to have started, made lists of the wildlife that was sold there, sent an army of researchers to trap and collect specimens for testing but have not found the animal host for the coronavirus. Very large numbers of bats have also been collected and tested but so far the virus has not been found in them.

There are some reports that coronavirus which are 98% similar to 2019-nCoV have been found in pangolins and that was used by this newspaper to show that the virus has a zoonotic origin. But pigs and humans are 99% similar genetically and look at how differently we turn out. Basically, an organism that is only 98% similar genetically is not at all the same thing.

Do not just tell people that your genetic analysis of the virus shows it arose naturally when the animal host cannot be found. If tigers in the Bronx zoo can get infected then surely there has got to be a population of wild animals that are carriers of the virus.

Until the source of the coronavirus is found, claims that the pathogen was engineered and then deliberately released remain plausible. Be scientific in how you handle this and keep an open mind. Until we have the facts, no one really knows."

But the author did talk about the man who took turtle cleanser instead of the antimalarial medication and made it seem like he took the antimalarial RX and died from it.  He found some under his sink and took it without medical guidance.  Until media starts reporting more objectively people critical of both views will resist.
2020-04-08 15:57:19,"I had read that there was a lab working with Coronavirus near the wet market in Wuhan, and near the hospital where the first doctors were taken ill. Since then, researchers have tried unsuccessfully to link the coronavirus to creatures at the wet market like the Pangolin. Could it be true that the virus came from the lab? It does seem plausible, doesn't it?  It also would explain some of China's early attempts to hide and downplay COVID-19."
2020-04-08 09:47:15,"I reading the title, I thought the question you’d answer was ‘is it safe for me to buy takeout food?’
I make a conscious effort to support my local restaurants, but every time I do, I think, is this when I’ll catch the virus?"
2020-04-08 10:49:24,"I don’t know what the answer is; whether I should continue to order takeout or not. I don’t want to put employees at risk. But I am continuing to order, and frequently.  My small town has a lot of family-owned restaurants. Like you, I’d hate to emerge in... June?... to find that Wendy’s and Red Lobster are the only thing that survived the economic apocalypse."
2020-04-08 10:53:39,"I own a small restaurant, six employees. We tried to do takeout and it was mostly successful, but what was on our mind everyday was what if one of us has it and isn’t showing symptoms. Did I want to be the one that found out a staff member was sick and then have to tell all our customers. Was it worth risking my life, high risk medical conditions, or those of my staff? What about all my customers? We stayed apart, but we do work in an enclosed space and were breathing the same air all day long.

Long story short, as a team, we decided to close for the next few weeks. My employees went on unemployment and I’m just going to wing it. It wasn’t an easy decision, but weighing all the facts left us in the situation that it’s better to be safe and sorry.

I think each place has to make this decision for themselves. I’m fortunate enough to have a little bit of money saved."
2020-04-08 11:20:42,I am glad to see this question explored. I have believed from the beginning that we are putting a lot of people at risk by keeping restaurants open for take out and delivery service and have decided not to participate in adding to that risk.
2020-04-08 11:40:59,"So here's an idea...for those of us of privilege, still drawing a salary or retirement...why not call your favorite restaurant that is doing take out, order the meal, find out what it costs, have them charge you for it, BUT DON'T HAVE THE MAKE IT OR DELIVER IT.  Consider it a donation to keep the place open.  A small way to take personal action.  And add a nice tip, by the way."
2020-04-08 11:59:58,"I'm quite shocked people have the financial resources for take out. Even pizza delivery for my family of four comes out to a minimum of forty bucks per meal let alone take out from the local sit down places. We've ordered out three times since March 14. I feel financially indulgent each time, and we stress about touching the packaging. I find the ordeal not worth it, and it leaves me with a feeling we may be frivolously spending money that could dry up further. I'm confused how the economy has plummeted the way it has, so many jobs have been lost, people are strapped for bills, but families have approx sixty to eighty bucks for a take out meal? All other employee safety and viral vector issues aside, how is the money even there to entertain this idea of ""let's keep supporting our local restaurants."" And should this be a cultural value right now foisted upon the desperate public? People are worried for next month's overhead. It doesn't make budget planning sense in the context of ""hunker down and prepare to stay in"" to encourage the public to splurge on pricy take out. I guess affluent people with stable salaries can do their share, but how much of the public still has secured salaries to be counted upon next week, next month, the next two to six months? Shouldn't we all be frugally saving the liquid income we have now in the event it completely dries up? Even before Covid, take out was a pricy luxury and treat. Now it's supposed to be a staple? Doesn't seem like good planning"
2020-04-08 12:00:11,"Restaurant workers, supermarket cashiers, bus drivers... need protection just as much as healthcare workers. If we can’t get them masks and PPE then they should be sent home, for their own protection and the protection of the dozens if not hundreds of people they come in contact with every day and the healthcare workers they will eventually come in contact with if they get sick."
2020-04-08 12:01:55,"Re your headline it is really neither.

With uncommon exception, restaurants that stay open for takeout are not making much money off the deal.

Also while there is always some greater risk re corona, people have to eat otherwise everybody will die. 

These héros of the restaurant industry should be provided free of charge the best mandatory protective gear available and as soon as time allows be given combat pay by the restaurants or if not by the government."
2020-04-08 12:09:29,"This article raises many good questions and confronts the ethical dilemma that supporting takeout restaurants could be putting their workers at risk. The same questions can be extended to all food related businesses and their workers - indeed, to all so-called essential businesses. The truth is that, if we are to survive this terrible plague, we need the production and distribution of food, medicines and other critical goods and services even though those involved with these businesses are at greater risk of contracting the disease. Their employers must provide them with appropriate protective equipment and a work environment that minimizes their risk to the greatest extent possible. And these employers need to be supported in their efforts by our governments which can direct available resources to them. The rest of us must do our part with social distancing.  And, of course, sincere thanks and generous tips to the extent our means permit."
2020-04-08 12:28:45,"The virus is fragile and sensitive to heat (30 Celsius/ 86 Fahrenheit) so maybe reheat your food deliveries? First time I went outside was March 29th. I am lucky as I still work. Since March 9th, I doubled my tips (always cash), so now $15 to $20/delivery (food/grocery). We are a family of four and order 2 to 4 times/week on average, when neither of us can prep lunch (and no leftover). Teenagers studying and husband working (from home). We all started confinement on March 9th when I got sick. I am actually still recovering (raspy breathing and tiring easily). Had to email school as they asked why boys didn’t show up. Explained that as we didn’t know if I had Covid-19 or not, we didn’t want our kids to risk infecting people. There were no tests available at the time and Schools were still open at the time in NYC. Teenagers realized that being confined with their parents is worse than school..."
2020-04-08 12:29:24,"My wife and I are in our 70s and thus among those at greatest risk of serious illness or even death if we contract coronavirus.

We are under “safer at home” quasi-quarantine in Florida and advised not to leave our home at all except perhaps for visits to the grocery, doctor or pharmacy. 

We therefore haven’t been to a grocery store for 2 or 3 weeks. We do not have take-out meals from restaurants, though they are widely available in our town, because of the uncertainties of how/whether food workers are being screened for and protected from CV.

We therefore rely on food deliveries from our local grocery store and prepare our own meals from fresh and packaged foods.

Of course those who select, check out, bag and deliver our foods may be carriers of CV, so we are taking some risk with home delivery. However, it is clear that delivery has a lower risk than if we went to the grocery store ourselves, and we can do some form of sanitizing the grocery bags‘ contents before we put them in our fridge or on our shelves.

The real issue is assessing and responding to risk. For us it is clearly very high risk to go to a grocery store and shop for ourselves, so we rely on delivery. We would love to support our local restaurants but it is difficult or impossible to assess the risk of having take-out food since we don’t/can’t know the health condition of the workers and the sanitary conditions of their kitchens."
2020-04-08 12:39:15,"My wife and I had this dilemma. We're in Texas, where most retail businesses, no matter what type, are still open and considered essential, and nearly all restaurants are open for pickup or delivery. We didn't know whether to support the businesses or stay home. Which is better? So many families are struggling financially and we could help by remaining customers, but then there is the health risk. We decided to give it a try. 

We've gotten (masked) takeout three times since the pandemic began in earnest. Only one of the restaurants was still busy but it is a wildly popular place that normally does a lot of takeout anyway. We noticed significant deterioration in food quality/taste at all of them. I'm sure it's due to fewer food deliveries and food not being turned as fast as it normally is with in-person seating being unavailable. 

Then our governor issued a special authorization allowing restaurants to sell bulk food directly to customers, it's moving so slow. That cinched it for us-no more takeout, grocery store only from now on.  Hopefully our state will finally start closing as many businesses as possible so the threat will pass quicker. But as long as the Texas governor doesn't force businesses to close, they won't. ""Business friendly"" is the TX euphemism meaning few worker protections."
2020-04-08 12:43:00,It’s not just takeout because grocery workers are at risk too. If we send everyone home then there is no food supply. That’s why we need more testing so we know where the virus is and who’s at risk.
2020-04-08 12:53:00,"It might seem more than obvious. ALL Essential Business workers who have contact with consumer public (i.e. restaurants, grocers, et al ) should: A. Be provided proper garments and gear for safer work. B. Be properly trained to lower any risks to themselves and customers to exposure. C. Be tested. If infected, sent home WITH PAY."
2020-04-08 12:55:25,"I think this article and related discussions in homes across the US reflects America right now in the worst of ways.

We are looking for tiny solutions, weighing risks on a micro level when we need broad economic leadership on the federal level to stave off the loss of countless small businesses and, in particular, countless restaurants. 

Our current American economy relies on the majority of Americans living on the edge. And we are trying to order from small businesses so they don't fall over that edge/cliff. But what really needs to happen is that we need to transform our economy into one that is not a gilded age. We need to have a robust, strong middle class that can weather storms. We need unprecedented government aid to all in these strange times.

No amount of ordering take out or buying gift cards or donations or flowery writing about tamales will save us."
2020-04-08 12:56:15,"From a public health point of view, it seems abundantly obvious that the safest thing for society as a whole is to close the restaurants, even for takeout, and to compensate those who have been thrown out of work.  Keeping restaurants open means workers have to take public transit and then work together in small confined spaces.  Whereas if everyone buys their food from groceries and prepares it at home, it reduces the societal risk."
2020-04-08 13:02:02,"I am struggling with the dilemma of whether to patronize my local coffee shop, and honestly don't know what to do. 

While those of us with resources are using this as an opportunity to reset our stressed and crowded lives, the poor and old and weak pay the price.

But I suppose it has ever been thus.  How did Dickens put it, ""It was the best of times, it was the worst of times . . ."""
2020-04-08 13:05:16,"I am the sous chef at a fine dining restaurant struggling to stay open. We are running a limited menu of food that travels well, about half our staff is self quarantined, and we're doing contactless pick up through our website and delivery through one of the apps. The app charges us an astonishing 30% fee. 10% and your tip goes to the driver and 20% goes to the app. If you want to help your favorite restaurant please consider a way that doesn't involve a third party delivery company."
2020-04-08 13:11:16,"Lilly mentioned not having the financial resources for takeout. As with all things, kids add to the cost. But even with kids, you can save money using certain strategies. It's just my wife and I but she is a restaurant junkie so we normally go out to eat at least twice a week and hit the leftovers another two times+ per week. She belongs to a lot of restaurant e-clubs and they send her many coupons for 20%+ off her meals or free meals. She buys the gift cards at Sam's that give her 20% off when spending $50+. She is also a veteran and many restaurants give her military discounts. We also split plates since neither of us eat much,   usually drink water, and occasionally do Groupons. We never pay full price for a restaurant meal and savvy shoppers don't have to either, especially now, when competition for business is stiff. If you want to go to the restaurant now, I suggest you order in advance, practice social distancing, and use the N95 masks if you have them."
2020-04-08 13:12:34,"I live in a small town in Napa Valley which is almost entirely dependent on tourism. It’s a ghost town here now with small restaurants, shops, and wineries closed down.

There are a few restaurants that have remained open for takeout and delivery. I am fortunate and able to order from them once a week, rotating who I order from. Though it’s not much, I feel I’m doing what I can to help support small local businesses. I fear that many of them won’t survive this when all is said and done."
2020-04-08 13:19:46,"If the restaurants you like are so important to you, why not make regular donations without ordering food, at the same time you prepare food at home?"
2020-04-08 13:22:41,"I think this article and the comments are borderline irresponsible. Before contemplating such dilemmas, perhaps one should actually work a day in a restaurant doing it right. My restaurants have been open for take out and are 100% contactless. The only interaction my staff has with guests are over the phone. I realize I am biased, but this is far, far safer than going to the grocery store - even a grocery store that enforces social distancing rules. The virus itself is heat sensitive and there have been no recorded instances of transmission via food. We have taken further sanitary measures within our space and all our staff travels to work securely. It can be done correctly and when it is, take out is the safest alternative for us all."

2020-04-08 13:25:18,"We are a family of 4 (now unemployed) restaurant people in NYC.  As much as I feel the pain of everyone else who is unemployed and worry if we will ever have an income again, prepared foods are a luxury not an essential.  While there are some who truly cannot shop or prepare meals for themselves, everyone else should stay home and deal.  Not every meal of your life has to be a feast. Humanity should be forgiving those who can't pay rent and bills right now and focusing on kindness and the health and safety for all. People need to look into their souls and examine their priorities. We lived here through 9/11 and there was a need to fight the good fight and not let the enemy get you down, but this is a different enemy, silent and deadly.  No amount of economic support will shield you from it's wrath.  Be smart, stay home and let as many others as possible do the same."
2020-04-08 13:36:29,"I am the owner and chef of my own restaurant in New York and agree with Tejal. For safety reasons we closed our restaurant before we were mandated to, and though we considered take out I personally could not figure out a way to receive supplies and prepare food in our kitchen while keeping workers separated as they prepared meals for take-out. For those that managed to do this and keep workers safe kudos to you. It was not our strength so I chose to create a fund to support our workers instead."
2020-04-08 13:36:54,Same goes for those working in supermarkets. Last time I went the cashiers and people who stock the shelves have no gloves or mask. Yesterday it was announced that one of the employees has the virus.
2020-04-08 13:37:42,"I feel the pain restaurant works are feeling. They are in a bad situation and there is no end in sight. I feel for them. Even after things ""normalize"" it will be months before people will get back to their normal routines. I wish them all the best of luck."
2020-04-08 13:41:50,"Unless you’ve owned a business, you will never know the difficulties and stress of making and running a successful establishment  YES! Support your favorite restaurants and help them remain viable so laid off workers have a job and a place of business to return to. To date, there is no indication that the virus is transmitted in food. Running a business is like pushing a boulder uphill. This virus and mandated closing of dining areas will cause that boulder to roll backward and crush the life of many businesses-not just restaurants. Support them if you can."
2020-04-08 13:41:42,"I am in my 30s and I saw the guy who brought my working from home safely self and my family Instacart delivery yesterday who looked like he was in his 70s. I felt incredibly selfish because he’s risking his life with repeated trips to the supermarket because I won’t make one. But he clearly needs the money as well, so is it either he starves or gets coronavirus? I left him a big tip but I don’t know what to do, I want to go shop myself now because I would likely survive, but collectively if we all do that it breaks social distancing down. We need a better social welfare system."
2020-04-08 13:43:25,"One big difference between LA and NYC is that in LA, you drive to pick up your takeout (Bad for environment, good for decreasing exposure) while in NYC, poor people, often undocumented, deliver your food by bicycle (better for environment, worse for workers, who are of course unprotected as they are ""independent contractors"" who usually work for tips.) As always, low paid workers, like takeout deliverers,  grocery store and fast food workers, sacrifice to provide for the well-off.
If you want to keep your favorite restaurant alive, donate the cost of a meal, or, even better, buy a dozen meals for the local hospital staff, who risk their lives to care for your neighbors."
2020-04-08 13:44:06,"Thank you for this story. I have not had take-out. It makes no sense. If someone is sick or more likely asymptomatic, I do not want them to make my coffee or my salad or burrito. I feel for the people put out of work, but my health and theirs is worth more. More people need to stay home."
2020-04-08 13:47:27,"Food? Right now we just need food to sustain us. Fresh, canned, cooked or raw. Forget the highfalutin retro tamale stand, the overpriced sushi..( high priced because the rent is 50% of overhead)...the ramen noodles you love...with the hard boiled egg? 

All these places will reemerge...people need to eat..."
2020-04-08 13:50:30,"Take out food is risky during virus, it's common knowledge restaurants are notoriously bad at providing paid sick leave and many work when sick - this could be employees in the kitchen preparing your food.  Add on a delivery person who is also handling your food - that's a lot of risk for one meal.  It is very irresponsible for people to be ordering individual meals from restaurants on daily or weekly basis right now.  I strongly feel only grocery stores and convenient stores should open, not restaurants, the risks are too high and not worth it for someone to get one meal.  Any restaurants open now should only be allowed to sale large quantities of food."
2020-04-08 13:52:36,"Here's a point that isn't really addressed here. We have NO system in place--like other countries did--to self-quarantine if you don't have a store of food and supplies (which requires money). No-contact takeout might be crucial for people to make it through self-quarantine.

Ideally, we'd do what other countries have done, which was contain this to a manageable level, then deliver food to them daily. We are a mess.

That said, I know a restaurant owner, and while they closed for a few weeks, that is simply not sustainable. Also, small business grants require retaining employees, which would allow them to continue getting paid. I feel like all of these things need to be explored in a full examination of the pros and cons."
2020-04-08 13:56:07,"Two things I’ve been doing, not huge but hopefully a help if we all did it? Weekly, I buy gift certificates now offered by my favorite local restaurants and coffee shops. I am spending less on food now that we eat at home, so my modest budget can handle this. Instead of eating out, I eat out “virtually.” And I will redeem the gift certificates only after restaurants are fully back up and financially secure. And I contribute to the local funds supporting restaurant workers."
2020-04-08 14:01:06,"This article did not touch on a point that I and some other commenters have mentioned: I will not order take-out because I have no idea about the health of the person who prepares the food. And if it gets delivered, I also have no idea about the health of the person who delivers it. We do not yet have good evidence of whether the virus survives on cold, warm or hot food, whether it can live on styrofoam, etc. We do have some evidence that it can live on cardboard (24 hours) and on plastic and steel (up to 3 days). So I have chosen to cook 100% of my family's meals."
2020-04-08 14:05:59,"A great piece, not judging but merely posing the paradox of supporting restaurants but knowing the risk to the workers. In my neighborhood it's fish and shrimp tacos, California burritos, Vietnamese pho, and pizza-- and the guilty pleasure of seeing others in the staggered line outside, some familiar even with facemasks on, picking up orders before returning home to eat."
2020-04-08 14:06:20,"we must be careful in every respect, if a food chain worker is infected, sick or just a carrier, he/she can spread viruses on the food thus putting at risk the clients.
I witnessed cold cut workers in a big market chain deli section cutting their salamis or cheeses without a mask and talking loud with clients that were put about ten feet away for safety reasons. No, this is not the way to go."
2020-04-08 14:07:27,Honestly I found it kind of funny that my job at a fast food restaurant was considered essential.

It seemed, all things considered, like such a small ask. The protest was broken up by the police.”

Nothing like a pandemic for exposing class distinctions. These don’t come naturally, which is why the dominant class has the police."

I have seen the lack of  wearing masks and disposable gloves as required  by employees and managers at my my local NYC chain supermarket where prepared food is on sale and produced.
It would take a great leap of faith to be assured that employees have used health safety methods ,and not sneeze or cough near their food production line."
2020-04-08 14:10:35,I assume it’s risking lives while saving restaurants and jobs. At some point we all will have to risk our lives to keep the economy going.
2020-04-08 14:21:09,"It would be kind of refreshing to see a restaurant worker strike (as well as a grocery store employee strike) .
Perhaps demanding double pay for the duration of the pandemic.
The wealthy get theirs anyway they can, as in the ""golden parachute""   retirement package, after running a company into the ground or exorbitant pay for board members who do little or nothing.
It would be nice to see the lower income folks take advantage of a situation and thus ask the wealthy  ...""so how does that feel when the shoe's on the other foot?"""
2020-04-08 14:44:49,"As an older guy, I’ve come to the (slow witted) conclusion that our entire social attitude and structure about who are “essential” workers and how we compensate them must forever change after this.  Who’s keeping these going right now?  All out infrastructure, especially all food related work, is being maintained by lower paid workers with much fewer benefits and job protection.  Grocery stores, restaurants, deliverers, truck drivers, etc.  After this, pay must rise, get rid of tipping, require insurance, strengthen union rights.  I never would have argued for these ten years ago, but the virus is a two-by- four to the head."
2020-04-08 14:47:16,"Now restaurants can apply for 10 weeks of many expenses and salaries, if they keep their employees.  I'm told it's pretty easy application process even in this distraught time.  Hopefully this can help the small ones survive.
Nicely written article about the writers love for her neighborhood dining establishments, and origins; but honestly I found it short on science, or particulars, of the risk, and what may be done to support restaurant workers."
2020-04-08 12:44:18,"As a restaurant owner, I struggled with whether to stay open for takeout only, or to close. Here’s why I decided to stay open. First, I have to assume at least some of my kitchen staff are undocumented, and therefore ineligible for unemployment benefits. They have families to feed, and no alternative for how to make rent. Keeping them employed is essential. Second, our small local meat and produce suppliers depend on us, as well. They are ineligible for the SBA relief funding. Many of them do not take a paycheck, and therefore are also not eligible for unemployment. Their supply chains are sticky, which means they can’t just pivot overnight from restaurants to grocery stores. Their other regular outlet—farmers markets—are also closed for business. I still don’t know if I made the right choice. But it’s clear that none of the challenges a pandemic presents are simple, black and white choices. Many of us have to decide for ourselves the cost-benefit analysis of each specific circumstance."
2020-04-08 13:17:20,"Ideally, we'd be able to pay people who stay at home for the public good.  Unfortunately, while this is being done in Denmark, the Netherlands, Great Britain, Germany, Canada, Belgium, and other places (<a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/23/world/europe/coronavirus-economic-relief-wages.html"" target=""_blank"">https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/23/world/europe/coronavirus-economic-relief-wages.html</a>), the best that ""the greatest nation on the planet"" can do is throw a handful of spare change into your hat and tell you that it was your habit of buying lattes that kept you from being a billionaire.

As for supporting local businesses:  one other factor to consider is that a truly ""local"" business is often a family affair. When we got takeout last week, the only people working were the owner and his/her family.  This should also be considered in the ""calculus of contagion"", as there are fewer ""independent"" sources in play."

2020-04-08 12:19:45,"The title of this article  -“ Is my takeout helping or risking lives “  comes across as elitist and obnoxious .As if all NYTimes readers are in a position to  bestow help or not to a section of the society who arent NYtimes readers themselves .

2020-04-08 14:04:04,"This article implies we should feel guilty for eating out and that there is some other safer socially responsible alternative, like cooking food yourself. Like what?

But where will you get that food to cook at home? Food doesn’t magically appear on the grocery store shelves. Modern food supply chains involve a long line of workers starting with farmers and crop pickers, cattle ranchers, butchers, factory workers that cut, wash, cook, and package your food. Truckers either deliver it to a restaurant or to a grocery store. Not eating out at best removes just one layer of labor from that long chain, the cooks and servers that bring it to you. But it also avoids the necessity of having grocery store shelve stockers, managers, and cashiers so in the end, it the same effect. Unless you are suggesting that people start growing their own food supply, which is impossible in today’s urban world, the entire premise of this article is flawed. It is also, ignorant to suggest (Like some commenters, not the author) that instead of eating out, one should donate money to the restaurant, this does nothing to solve the problem of hunger and poverty that so many are facing."

2020-04-08 14:31:10,"A simple solution to this question is to buy gift cards for restaurants you frequent. As a patron, you know you'll use them later, yet you are offering them the critical cash up front during the crisis. This protects the workers, props up the restaurant, and gives you the meals in return with a bit of patience."
2020-04-08 11:58:58,"I have been worried about takeout and delivery from the start, for two reasons. My husband is immunosuppressed and I fear coming in contact with the virus and passing it to him. Secondly, I fear for the health of the workers who prepare and deliver the food. Every person who gets the virus can pass it to multiples of people. How will be ever get to the other side of this if we keep exposing the most vulnerable? It’s about taking up hospital beds, valuable equipment, putting the lives of healthcare workers and the rest of us at risk. I have struggled with my decision not to order takeout because I know that restaurant workers are some of the most economically vulnerable in this country and i have wanted to support them. But would they not be better served by killing this virus so we can all go back to work safely? This is hard, but every life lost to this beast is a horror. I want it to be over. I have ordered some gift cards instead, and will give them as gifts later. Please stay home."
2020-04-08 14:50:26,"Take and bake pizza seems the safest take out. With careful package opening management and few extra minutes in the oven.. then burritos, unwrap them carefully,zap them in the microwave. 
 Our home town iconic sit down breakfast coffee restaurant is closed for the first time since 1946. After the morning rush old war vets gathered,in the70's the WW1 guys began to pass away. The last WW2 vet 98 yrs old showed up on the last bussiness day 3 weeks ago. He showed up every morning on his electric scooter, a 6 mile round trip...to retell his tales as a glider pilot in Operation Market Garden for the hundredth time."
2020-04-08 11:47:17,Essential workers should have support with basic needs. The rest of us can suck it up and prepare our own meals. People can tell themselves they are supporting local businesses. In reality they are fulfilling their own selfish need to have the food they want. There is no way to distance in a kitchen. Keeping these businesses open is increasing infection rates and by extension killing more people.
2020-04-08 14:43:05,"Enough of whining. Takeouts are like any other business adjusting itself to commercially adverse conditions, and their ultimate goal is to generate profit."
2020-04-08 13:55:30,"Not knowing the conditions in a kitchen providing takeout, I choose to cook the food I eat taking great care in prep. It’s so hard for these workers and it is unfortunate that we have ruthless grifters in DC who will not help them."
2020-04-08 15:00:18,"As long as our local pizzeria is open, we will support them by buying a pizza once in a while.

2020-04-08 15:01:51,"I think it's disingenuous of Mr. Rao to use the verb ""skyrocket"" when it comes to the virus in California. Look at the data, the virus growth rate here is one of the lowest in the nation. The Bay Area was the first region to order shelter-in-place. We are still waiting for the explosive numbers seen elsewhere. Governor Newsom ordered the entire state to stay at home 3 days later. For our size and population, California has shown how to flatten the curve."
2020-04-08 15:02:11,There are so many variables in this very important question of whether or not to order take out. I think there is no blanket answer and take it case by case. Local family owned businesses that are running the show by themselves while letting their employees stay home and collect unemployment I still solicit. I want my money to stay in the community and to see these people on the other side. Not a lot of places that can do this so I mostly cook at home. I take the same approach while grocery shopping and solicit locally owned stores and co-ops which seem to take much greater precaution to protect their workers and clients than the big grocery chains.
2020-04-08 15:02:50,"My son out in LA probably ate lunch 5x/wk from food trucks until 3 weeks ago.  No takeout anymore, and cooking my recipes since.

 Last night, he told me his girlfriend was craving a fast-food In-N-Out burger, and he didn't want risk it. Too many workers are going in sick and passing it on to others, he said.

 So, looking up which burger places have paid sick days, McDonalds was the only one he found- and that's where they went.  Keeping fingers crossed everyone is healthy."
2020-04-08 15:08:38,"My husband and I are very careful to patronize local restaurants that are taking care of their employees, or running the business strictly by themselves. The coffeehouse next door is family owned and run, and as the owners of our home, see them as especially important to support in a struggling neighborhood. Even if it’s just a cup of coffee each day, we’ll be there."
2020-04-08 15:09:10,"If you want to support local Individually owned restaurants and are concerned about the staff working, buy a Gift Certificate. This provides funds for the restaurant as it tries to hang on until better times."
2020-04-08 15:12:48,"Here's the thing I don't understand. The Internet is filled with advice on disinfecting the containers that your groceries come in, laundering clothing you have worn in public without shaking it, keeping a 6' distance marked on the pavement for lines going in the grocery stores. Now the suggestion is for all of us to wear masks while we are out in public. So taking all of this into consideration, why is no one worried about eating take out or delivery food? People have to prepare the food. People have to be safe who are preparing the food. Just because gastric juices will supposedly kill the virus, how is it that I could get it on my hands from handling a box and touching my face and I would be in trouble. Why could I not also get it on my hands by touching a sandwich and then touching my face? Look, I'm all for supporting local businesses but I'm not going to do it at the risk of my life. The last meal I ate which was not prepared by me was in Spain and on the airplane home mid February. This aspect of public safety is being overlooked and I fear it's being overlooked at many people's￼￼￼￼ peril.  If you want to support local businesses, go online and buy a gift card. It's safer for everybody.  ￼"

2020-04-08 15:13:05,My brother works in a kitchen in LA. There are 2 shifts to avoid having all 8 workers there at the same time but they do often overlap for a couple hours a day. They are not being provided masks. He has voiced his concerns to no avail. He has called out one of the chefs who never wears gloves. There is no concerted direction and it’s scary.
2020-04-08 15:15:33,"I almost never cooked.  Picked up great food every two or three days from various great restaurants in NJ. Till about three weeks ago.  Until every single food service workers wears N95 masks and changes their gloves every hour, they will not see a penny from me.  For years I've told waitresses and waiters not to talk when making and serving my food or drinks.  It should be protocol from here on in.  Sorry, I refuse to put my life on the line for a Starbucks or piece of pizza."

2020-04-08 15:24:58,"Local and state governments have passed laws making failure to enact social distancing a crime, but this is rarely being enforced. Masks and gloves for food workers should have also been required. Instead, we get suggestions and recommendations and law enforcement looking the other way. Are the police  all sheltering-in-place while collecting their salaries? What are they doing--as there are a lot fewer drunk drivers, bar brawls and illegal parking going on these days."
2020-04-08 15:34:27,"Commercial kitchens, even at many high-end places, are notorious for cramped working conditions.  It is logistically impossible for a culinary team to crank out meals and practice social distancing at the same time."
2020-04-08 15:34:39,"I have bought all groceries and cooked every meal for my family. No takeout. I’ve worked in restaurant kitchens. It’s just not safe, it’s not healthy, and it’s putting lives at risk. It shouldn’t be up to us to support business at this time. Our government should have a robust program to be taking care of these workers, but ideology and ineptitude has left it to us to be consumers at a time when we should be doing as little of that as possible."
2020-04-08 15:38:41,"The food industry will never look the same again. Prepare for the rise of the pick up or delivery only revolution. Great food needs a kitchen and a talented staff but not a large dining room, 50,000$ dollar a month rent, 70$ plates and a 1000$ dinner for four. There will still be the expensive, artistic presentations that people Instagram but the majority of places aren't reopening. Owners see the upside of selling expensive food without giant overhead costs. People will start being more ""social"" in their homes and with great food."

Does every meal need to be some big formal thing?  Also, I'm not so sure about delivery versus going into the supermarket with gloves and a mask and getting sme basic things and wiping them off when I get home?  I was thinking delivery was off loading my risk onto someone else who is probably not being compensated very well.  In short, is anyone else just eating toast, eggs, cheese, carrots, frozen pizzas?"
2020-04-08 15:47:44,"Yes, you are putting workers at risk by buying take-out. And yes, you are helping the economic situation, particularly for those workers at increased risk due to your actions. 
I don't think that the long-term restaurant scene in Los Angeles should be a concern right now. The health and economic welfare of restaurant workers are legitimate concerns, and in inevitable tension."
2020-04-08 15:48:47,"I agree with supporting local restaurants, but have been reluctant to order out because as this article points out someone has to cook it. Last week at the urging of my wife I ordered a large take out dinner from a local pizzeria/restaurant, but decided to pick it up instead of having it delivered. When I picked up my order I noticed that it was business as usual with the cooking staff. They couldn't use social distancing as the cooking area wasn't set up for it. No one was using a mask and I don't believe gloves either. This place has a good reputation and the food was very good, but I'm not taking any more chances and will cook all meals at home until the Covid-19 virus has passed. I would suggest checking the restaurants out before ordering if you want to continue with takeouts."
2020-04-08 15:08:41,"whats more dangerous, for both employees and the customer — ordering takeout, or going to the supermarket? 

ordering takeout:
- you pick up your food at the door and exchange $
- the workers make your food in the kitchen, away from customers
- the workers wear gloves, as is customary in normal times as well - and if anything were to contaminate your food, it would be killed in the cooking process
- most if not all the workers are not elderly
- most restaurants are small family owned businesses

going to the supermarket:
- you walk around a large store with strangers doing your best to stay 6' away from each other
- you touch things, sometimes put them back, other people touch them too
- you touch the carts
- you touch the same self checkout as everyone else, or you go to a line with a cashier whos been interacting less than 6' from people all day, handling money
- most cashiers (at least where I am) are elderly, retired and just looking to make extra $ to supplement their pathetic and unlivable social security checks. 
- most supermarkets are large publicly held corporations. 

which is better? its a lot easier to shame people for GOING OUTSIDE!!! and ordering takeout. the social shaming going on right now (at least where i live) is insane. people are shunned for hiking in the great outdoors in a state with a population less than suffolk county NY (where im from)!"

I own a hand cranked clothes washing machine (originally bought for cycling gear) and have been have washing all my clothes by hand, completely avoiding the laundromat. I calculate everything that might require a trip outside of my home in terms of reducing exposure and social interaction. As much as I want to support my local establishments and dearly miss their food, I cannot justify the added points of exposure to Covid to try to keep their lights on. Now factor in the relatively inflated cost of delivered food during an economically uncertain time and I see no way that I can justify ordering in when I'm a capable chef."
2020-04-08 16:06:48,The restaurant down the street from me has a delightful space but no only takeout.  Recently I ordered meatballs from them and the young man who brought them to my car was masked and gloved.  He handed them in through the window  without touching the car. I watched him wiped down the door handle with disinfectant when another customer picked up a pizza and he even wiped of my credit card after running it.

It seemed, all things considered, like such a small ask. The protest was broken up by the police.”

Why is it when cops are protesting a new contract, or a police shooting, where they feel they have been wronged, freely demonstrating as is there right, they ask us THE PEOPLE, to support them. These demonstrations are NEVER broken up by the police. Protect their rights? Time to protect the people’s rights, our rights! Now more than ever"

No mask, no gloves. When it rains, they crowd even closer together under an awning.

For sure it's not their first career choice. It's the work they can get.

People did NOT physically distance, wanted to pay via cash, and stood way to close to each other when they came in to pick up food. Workers are definitely exposed exponentially and you should take measures to distance yourself. I think if we want to support restaurants, we should all donate to our favorite places.  That is a win for both the restaurant and the employees.  Don’t think for a second that you and that worker are not putting each other at risk."

2020-04-08 16:41:40,"It is a worthy conversation, but I think it misses the point to some extent. In the US, as in Brazil where I am writing from, there are essentially no rules in the informal economy that includes much of the restaurant and food preparation industry. The workers currently cooking and delivering, at varying risks for themselves and their families, are doing so not because they are forced to by unsympathetic bosses, but because they have no other way to make a living. How many restaurants are paying their employees and part-time and delivery app workers to stay safe and at home? Very few, if any, and fewer yet as the weeks stretch out. The choice for these workers is to continue to work if they have that option, or not be able to eat (sometimes), buy medication (often) or pay rent (mostly). They have a better sense than you do of the risks they are taking by working, and by not working. Don't take away that choice out of presumption. 

In a normal world, there would be proper labor laws, there would be owners and companies who would dig deep into their reserves to help their staff, and there would be a responsive, competent government. That is unfortunately not America (or Brazil) in 2020, but perhaps it will be one day if we want it to."

There isn't an answer. If we kept everything open, the number of sick people would be astronomical, and businesses wouldn't be able to stay open, as employee and customers fell ill. We'd still have no customers, no workers, and panic and death on top of that. 

Close everything, and we live, but our businesses fail. We are looking at a New Deal like we'e never seen to try to bridge people back into jobs. And none of it will work without serious commitment to testing, identifying illness, working to contain it as much as possible,  and defining for to a community how to reduce risk, but live with it, and work in it for the foreseeable future."

    I go to 20 homes a day.  All of our drivers do, about 100 homes a day, total.  We stand 3 feet from the customer, hand them their food, take their dirty germ covered money, and make change.  Then we go back to the store and work in close quarters with 10-15 people, none of whom are wearing masks.  We all answer the same phone to take orders.  It's a perfect system for spreading pandemic.  I imagine we will all be infected by May.
     It doesn't have to be this way.  We could take online orders only, paid for by card with no signature, ring the door bell, and leave the order on the porch.  Then, we would not be a virus spreading machine.
    I've spoken with an attorney who didn't think a lawsuit could force Dominos to make these minor changes in their business behavior.    
     But, Toney Evans is suing Walmart in Cook Count  Municipal Court for gross negligence and reckless disregard for public safety.  Toney's brother worked at Walmart and died of the virus.

2020-04-08 18:23:23,"Think of the waitress or cook supporting several young kids on what they earn at a mom & pop restaurant.  

YOUR choice determines if they can buy food and pay rent,  and, oh, yes, pay the doctor/ and corporate owned hospital for what they owe for an illness or injury. 

Yes, there is some risk to buy ""take out"" or ""grab and go"" food.  There is risk to everything in life, always.    

Preferably the food deliverer should have a mask and gloves he/she can change after every delivery, and you should use  credit cards, not cash, to buy it.  

 Even if he/she is not allowed by ""corporate"" to do this (see post by a Dominos employee below),  simply wipe off or spray down the container of the food, wash your hands after disposing of it, and eat the food.  Gastric juices destroy the virus.

By occasionally ordering out you are helping low wage workers."

It seemed, all things considered, like such a small ask. The protest was broken up by the police.""

So the franchise owner, instead of behaving like a human being and giving his employees a reasonable 2-week paid leave, instead cut them off, refused to negotiate, and called the police? We are looking at the same strike-breaking tactics that the wealthy have always used against workers. The selfish and powerful are determined to retain control, and regard this type of situation as adversarial, an ""us versus them"" scenario, instead of realizing that the people who work for them are also humans who get sick, need to eat, have families, and have to maintain a place to live. If that franchise owner can't afford to pay employees a decent wage, provide healthcare and sick leave, then he's got a bad business plan and should not be in business at all. Boycott businesses like this! Put these people out of business entirely, if they refuse to live up to their end of the social contract. Make them realize they cannot get away with this kind of myopic, selfish behavior any more. And let them know they have to quit using taxpayer-funded police to solve their communication problems for them! Try talking to workers, instead!"

Moved?! How about you cook your own food!"
2020-04-08 17:16:37,"This article makes the wrong assumption. Almost all restaurants require employees to come in to work, sick or not. Almost all restaurant employees will come in to work sick since none have healthcare and none want to lose their job. Most restaurants assume a note from the doctor is a fake. So it seems there is as much a risk to the customer as their is to the employees."

2020-04-08 18:57:33,"Restaurant workers don't get paid sick leaves, so some having mild symptoms may opt to come to work. This has been a problem long before this pandemic. 

Ideally, all essential workers should be tested for the virus weekly. These include healthcare workers, policy officers, fire fighters, etc. If restaurants are considered essential, then their workers should be tested the same during the entire length of the pandemic. This, of course, is not feasible given the current limitation in testing capability."
2020-04-08 19:00:15,"I’m not sure what conclusion the author decided... I think support is warranted for a restaurant taking precautions with absolute conviction. For a restaurant that is cavalier: if they aren’t protecting their employees, then they ~are~ spreading the virus.

The problem comes from not knowing which category the restaurant is in. If you ask, of course they say the right thing. Gauging by the food/payment exchange is too late, plus it doesn’t tell you what happened behind the scenes. (Though it’s been fairly obvious here, with most takeout the same as always.) I’m trying to get the message out by calling in orders with “I’d prefer to support businesses that protect their employees, what measures are you taking?” But it probably doesn’t help unless it happens to be the owner.

Also, even if a restaurant is trying, it can be ruined by thoughtless or selfish other customers. Which is a problem here: neighbors still having parties, yahoos crowding other shoppers in the market, market employees still not wearing masks...

It’s a terrible calculus, but if a restaurant isn’t protecting their employees, then it’s probably best for everyone if it closes. I realize that takes away an essential choice from their workers, and it may have serious consequences for people who can’t cook, too. It’s a poor substitute, but until more people here start behaving responsibly, I’m just supporting the food pantry."

2020-04-08 19:48:55,"If you frequented a restaurant before COVID, you already know if they practiced safe hygiene in the kitchen, if they treated employees fairly and if they knew how to competently follow rules and run a business responsibly.  Save those restaurants by ordering takeout (which is safer for everyone than home delivery).  The protections are as solid as at supermarkets, and unless you're eating canned or frozen food all the time, you're at no greater risk.  Hopefully the restaurants we all love, which add so much to our neighborhoods and quality of life, will survive.  But a note to the regulators:  stop treating small business as a tax and unfunded mandate punching bag.  These businesses are marginal operations in the best of times; in recent years, legislatures have treated them like they're owned by rich, greedy owners bent on shafting their employees, when the truth is, they are politically weak and easy targets.  They need relief now (and are getting it, thankfully), but it needs to be lasting, because if size is survival, after COVID I also don't want to see nothing but chain restaurants in shopping plazas serving the same menu nationwide."

If we had standard epidemiological surveillance, we would be giving covid-19 tests to a large sample of Americans, including restaurant, retail and delivery workers, which would tell us whether certain occupations, and certain practices, were associated with and causing infections. 

We would find out if employees were getting infected in some retail operations, but not others. 

We could find out whether there were certain safety procedures that would prevent restaurant and other retail employees from getting infected. 

In Wuhan, China, they set up a system to keep the food supply chain running and supply residents with food and other necessities. It would be nice to know how they did it. 

The responsibility for testing lies with the CDC, FDA, and USPHS. The overall responsibility lies with President Trump, of course. It would be nice to have a businessman who could coordinate with private industry to produce tests. Instead, we've produced about 350,000 tests, the same number as South Korea with 1/6 our population, and we didn't have the tests when we needed them, for surveillance and contact tracing."

The same goes for retail establishments, a tragedy in the making"
2020-04-08 20:43:20,There is risk involved no matter how you get your food.  It's not clear to me that grocery shopping is safer than take-out.  Grocery workers have died from Covid.  We have been ordering take-out regularly for weeks now but going to the grocery store was a truly frightening experience.
2020-04-08 21:03:46,"First -my bias. I am in my seventies, and the sole proprietor of a six employee coffee shop in a small city. In mid March, prior to any bailout, I elected to close my shop for two weeks in an effort to lessen the chance of being a venue to spread the new virus. California soon instituted social distancing but allowed shops such as mine to remain open. 
   On April 1 the shop reopened. This was after contacting each of my staff to ask if they wished to come back or not. All of the staff were informed that I would pay them for the time they had been off. They asked to return.
   The shop reopened with shorter hours and pickup service only. No one is allowed into the shop, employees wear masks,and I do not enter the shop at any time when anyone is there.
    Patronage is down 75% and expenses are barely covered. Why stay open? I stay open because my employees have families and need to get paid. It is my experience that people want and need to work. There is more to a job than just a wage, there is a sense of purpose, a need to belong.
   This pandemic won't last forever. If I can hold on until things start to turn around we will all start over from there. Until then we should, at least, try to help others as best we can in whatever way we can."
2020-04-08 21:07:20,"It is a terrible dilemma. I also have been concerned about the number of working people that will not be able to get help as they are not documented. Farm workers, restaurant workers etc. Even if you say no to restaurants and buy only from a grocery store you are still putting those at risk that work the farms, drive the trucks, make the boxes and bags for packing, man the warehouses, the docks, the gas stations  etc etc. So maybe buying from a restaurant allows a few less to work in your grocery chain for a few days and helps those folks stay healthy...and also helps a small restaurant. Hope all who need help can receive it."
2020-04-08 21:55:25,"We've settled on just ordering from Papa Murphy's. Much cheaper (almost as good as some, much better than a lot) as most delivery joints. Order/pay online, easy peasy. Walk in the store, go near no one (zero interactions), take off the to-go rack near the door. 

When I get home, I set it down on the counter, unwrap, set the pie on another part of the counter. Throw away the plastic wrap, wipe down the counter where it was with disinfectant wipes. Wash hands thoroughly.

425ºF in the oven for 12-15 minutes will kill most anything."

And they are not the residual revenue holder very likely....that's the restaurant owner who may not even be on the premises. 
 
I am not judging Ms. Rao for ordering takeout. But she does urge us to do the obvious thing which is in our power to make the situation better: TIP THEM DOUBLE OR TRIPLE."
2020-04-08 22:29:05,"Unfortunately, the very fact that restaurant owners and employees are struggling financially increases the likelihood that they will take extra risks like working while feeling ill.

If I knew of a place that was enforcing distancing, where workers wore masks and gloves, had touchless pickup, I’d be there in a minute.  Other restaurants I know are selling food basics repackaged.  They are being creative.   These guys have to think out of the box, communicate cleanliness...then I’ll spend some money.

Not for everyday, but consider this scenario: The virus simply isn’t going to just “go away” unless we have a vaccine, which is not likely for the next 18 months. Can we have a world without professionally prepared food for that long? Restaurants will have to evolve in order to survive, and that means slimmer, delivery-friendly menus, PPE for workers, in-house payment and delivery, contactless drop-off and contactless pickup. We tip the restaurant 18%. Remove food in own containers, discard packaging, wash our hands and thoroughly heat our food. It can be done."
2020-04-09 10:25:34,"I'm in two minds as to what to do. I'd love to keep supporting my local restaurants, but each time I get takeaway or delivery, I wonder if it's an unnecessary risk for me (and potentially for the people I interact with to make the transaction). 

In the age of social media, we see restaurants directly pleading with would-be customers not to abandon them, and that makes it harder to make what seems the safe choice. They are hurting, and I worry what the landscape will look like when all this is over. The structure of our society just cannot cope with a disruption like this."
2020-04-09 06:07:04,"Really, the writer of the article should really think ethically about how the NYT can influence people, and how many people might not order take out now, and how that might put people out of business or on the street, especially gig economy workers who have very little protections from govt assistance or unemployment, and who have already lost so much business on riders already. How about just minding your own business and letting restaurants and individuals decide what is best for themselves? It's not like this article is really saying anything other than it is a conflicting subject. So, stating the obvious. Glad to know you care contributor, now can we go back to trying to stay afloat and help others stay afloat?

2020-04-09 12:42:59,"Restaurant workers complain they have no masks and are crammed together in kitchens. People think they are supporting these workers by providing income, but in many states, unemployment has been modified to cover these workers, if only the owners would lay them off. 

I know a couple who have been laid off in Michigan. They filed for unemployment, and although there are delays, they will soon receive over $10,000 in a single month with the combined Federal stimulus and unemployment benefits, plus benefits from the State. Specifically, they will each receive around $300/wk from the State. Plus $600/wk in unemployment from the Fed. So, $7200 in combined benefits for one month. Plus they each get the $1200 stimulus and $500 each for 2 kids, so an additional one-time $3400 on top of the $7200. And they will continue to get the $7200 for a few months. This is more than they made while employed, and they're grateful that their employers laid them off instead of making them continue to work for split tips.

Is it just a matter of time before grocery workers realize how much money the unemployed are receiving? The govt should pay them an equivalent amount, because their jobs are actually necessary. They risk their health for $10/hr and it is unfair. The government needs to examine these essential industries (not just grocery, but also mail/package delivery and healthcare) and ensure these workers are compensated for risking their health right now in order to keep society going."

2020-04-09 14:03:28,"Reading many thoughtful comments here, however, many conclusions are based on ethical, moral, social, political, financial and economic reasons. As far as I know a virus is purely biological and will not bend to any of those human impulses. 

So we need to fight this virus on those terms. If you are already buying groceries - in person or by delivery - get enough to cover ALL of your needs and avoid ANY additional risks including restaurants so that we all get through this as soon as possible!

If our leaders had any actual plan based in PUBLIC HEALTH that is what we would all be doing. Is Dunkin Donuts coffee really essential right now? At the risk of people’s lives?? Cuz that’s what we’re doing right now.

I say this with ALL due respect to all restaurant workers and owners and out of concern for their health and safety. I CANT WAIT to get back to my favorite places!"
2020-04-09 14:39:34,"All these workers should see their wages continue by means of electronic funds transfer directly to a digital account, a little at a time, much the same way as they'd receive a paycheck. Businesses shouldn't have to wait for a 'bail out' bill to pass and employees shouldn't have to wait for both sides of the aisle to agree on stimulus wording. I completely understand our desire to help each other out in difficult times and to want to support our local businesses. However, during this global and community pandemic in a situation where no one is sure who might be infected and even experts are not completely sure they understand all modes of transmission, it should not the be the complete responsibility of patrons to put themselves at risk of great personal harm in order to 'save restaurants' and to make sure their employees can pay their utilities and not go hungry."
2020-04-09 17:05:05,"These are tough times, and the whole takeout thing during COVID, is another tough call. 

On the one hand, it's absolutely true that...many of the small coffeeshops, restaurants and bars that make our neighborhoods true Neighborhoods, will never ever recover from this.  Some businesses which may be hanging on by a thread now (via takeout), may valiantly 'reopen for in-house business' later, only to have to finally throw in the towel a few months later, never having been able to recoup their losses.

So on one hand, I feel that more than anything, the takeout-only option is more to save the overall business vs providing income to the employees, for most employees would be able to collect unemployment if the restaurant were to temporarily close.  But as for the restaurants who may have some undocumented workers, then I'm all for us trying to help those workers continue to have paying jobs, by way of ordering takeout.  And let's hope they are taking all the usual precautions for themselves."
2020-04-09 17:19:24,"This is a great article, people really need to consider how irresponsible it is to order individual meals from restaurants at this time.  Civilization won't end, dining out (getting prepared meals)  is a luxury not a necessity."
2020-04-09 18:48:37,"As much as I'd love to order take-out, I'm stopped by several points: First, people can be asymptomatic, and still spread the virus. Second, the language from the various authorities about whether you can get the virus from food. The reports say there are no _known_ cases of the virus being contracted from food, but none of the authorities are saying categorically that you can't - meaning they actually don't know. I'm unwilling to be a test case. Third, they say not to touch your mouth (as well as nose and eyes), as contact of the virus with mucosa can cause an infection. Sure, unwrap the food, but what if an asymptomatic infected worker touched/breathed over the food during prep? Wouldn't eating that food - putting it into my mouth! - cause exposure?

Again - I know the authorities _think_ it's safe, but the truth is, they just don't know for sure. I'm not going to be a guinea pig, or make my family a guinea pig, on the basis of a presumption.

The closest I come is a take and bake, like Papa Murphy's. At least there, even if a worker shed virus on the pizza, it's subjected to 15 minutes in a 400 degree oven in my home, so anything on the pizza and tray has been killed. 

In short, unless I cook it or it comes from a factory-sealed package, I'm not risking it/"
2020-04-10 17:32:40,"I understand why there’s a danger to restaurant workers if their bosses do not arrange for them to keep physical distance and wear masks and gloves.
I do not understand why getting carry-out/delivery food from a restaurant, if done carefully, would present a danger to customers. In my area, restaurants offer no-contact pickup. The customer orders and pays online and is given a pickup time. The customer drives to the restaurant, calls the restaurant if necessary to say the customer has arrived, opens the trunk while remaining seated in the car, and a restaurant worker places the carry-out food in the trunk and closes it, without ever coming closer than 6 feet to the customer, who remains seated in the car the entire time.
At home, the customer, wearing gloves, empties the food into dishes and immediately discards the restaurant containers in trash outside. Then removing gloves, washes hands thoroughly, while reheating the carry-out food in the oven, which kills any corona virus that could conceivably be on the food. For this reason, ordering food intended to be served hot is best.
Food deliveries to homes can be no-contact, just as grocery deliveries can be.
Buying restaurant pickup/delivery food seems to me considerably safer than shopping in a grocery store, and it keeps restaurant workers employed."
2020-04-10 17:58:55,"Why is every NYT Pick comment here someone announcing that they're refusing to order take-out in order to keep themselves/the people they live with safe? 

The chief danger this article is meant to highlight is not the minuscule risk that a customer will contract COVID-19 by touching the occasional takeout container. It's the much greater risk faced by restaurant workers commuting to and from work, laboring in close quarters in small kitchens, standing in queues with other delivery people to pick up dozens of orders a day, but also living paycheck-to-minimum-wage-paycheck, dependent on tips, or often ineligible for federal benefits.

The whole point of the article was to spend at least a few minutes thinking about whether those of us who are privileged enough to have a choice about whether or not to order out are helping or hurting the low-wage employees who make that possible with whatever choice we're making, and to grapple with the reality that in our current economic system this is a complex question without an easy answer. Seems like a lot of readers couldn't manage to look past themselves to do that."

2020-04-11 02:38:12,"In ordering takeout, you need to apply one single rule - are you in the at risk population? For most, the perils of C19 are like the annual perils of flu; uncomfortable but not life threatening. It is worth the risk to keep those businesses going, their staffs employed. But for those at risk, the elderly. the unhealthy, there  are NO safe options. Food prepared by others always carries the risk of transmitting illness, you see this every winter with colds and flu. Support you local businesses, but do not downplay the risk."
2020-04-11 05:47:54,"I noticed the writer uses the expression ""shelter in place"" in this article. It's an interesting phrase since it means, in the case of corona virus, the opposite of what it usually suggests. If you're given an order to ""shelter in place"" it normally requires you to stay where you are. If you're in a supermarket when the order comes down, you stay there. If you're home, that's where you remain. But if you're not at home when the order is given, you don't go home. You remain, say, in the market. If those who issue the orders wanted you to stay home, they would say, and do say, Stay Home assuming you have one.

Shelter in place has a nice paramilitary ring to it. It implies you're part of the action. When one shelters in place during a mass shooting one doesn't leave the shelter to get take out from Zabar's. It's all very well to refer to yourself as Sheltering in Place during the present corona virus, but in the world where that expression makes any sense, it  doesn't allow for walks in Riverside Park or trips to Bouley."
2020-04-10 15:30:09,"It has been stated several times that ""there is no evidence"" that coronavirus has ever been/can be transmitted through food, specifically takeout. Not reassuring. Lack of evidence doesn't mean it can't/hasn't happened. If a sick, unmasked food preparer breathes all over a serving as they pack it for delivery and covers the food with viral particles, how is putting that fresh delivery in your mouth any different from touching a contaminated surface and putting your finger in your mouth?"

I want them to economically survive this crisis and hope more of my neighbors will order from them too."
2020-04-11 22:58:28,"I think the best answer is that if a local restaurant stays open, then you can assume they have weighed the cost/benefits for them, and it's good to support their efforts by ordering take-out with contactless delivery and contactless payment if you can afford it and if you are not yourself high risk.  On the other hand, I don't think this holds true for chains and franchises, in which case it would be best to call and find out and then explain to management or contact the corporation to tell them WHY you will no longer patronize them ( until they institute paid leave for workers, pay raises, protective health measures, health insurance, etc.)"

2020-04-13 20:54:52,"I thought about takeout when this all first started but then I realized that most of the folks who work in the kitchens are probably riding mass transit and no matter how diligent they are, there could be traces of the virus on clothing, etc. If I did, it would have to be cooked food, no salads. 
We've never experienced anything like this and as a senior, I have to take extra precautions. I pray this ends soon so the hardships that people are suffering can be remedied as soon as possible."
2020-04-14 13:29:32,"Prepared food is a luxury.  Something to be sacrificed during the virus.  Trusting restaurant employees who often receive no paid sick leave to prepare food is not smart.  Just as another person commented, most of the restaurant workers in the city are using public transportation which increases their likelihood of being sick, and if you add delivery such as grubhub etc you are only adding another layer of risk.  Why, so you can be lazy and not make your own food or stock up on a week's worth of food vs relying on take-out for individual meals.  Lazy and indulgent.  If you want to help restaurants then make a donation or purchase a gift card, otherwise it's not helping, it's hurting."

I agree with all the measures we have to take to combat this virus, but I am starting to wonder what kind of toll it will take from economically to psychology for millions.

While the language is a bit confusing/ambiguous, it sounds like some places across the world have actually told people that they cannot go out for anything...under any circumstances?...can't go to the market?...can't go out for a walk??

People have already made Extreme sacrifices, but if more places start telling folks that they can't even go outdoors ...and even while social distancing... well...I can't even imagine.

We all get that this disease is insidious, but we must continue to keep in mind the other massive price we are paying, and have some balance.  We say we are 'saving lives', but at the same time, we are destroying far more lives.  Many people will never recover from the restrictions placed on them as individuals...as families...as communities....as workers/employees....as small business owners, etc.

The idea that I could potentially be told one day that I cannot leave my home, Under Any Circumstances, makes me positively insane... just the mere thought of it.  And for those who may say 'oh, it will never come to that in the US...or in NYC...we'll always be able to go to the market, or for a walk...', while that may indeed be the case, the fact that I'm this fearful of potentially losing my human right to freedom of movement shows just how berserk it's gotten."

But flattening the curve also means flattening the economy. So for the vast majority of us who have no golden goose, when and how will we eat? (Jumping back out there too soon will also flatten the economy as we deal with a million or more deaths).

The COVID-19 death represent .5% of the total global death toll to date.

To get to this rate the greater part of the global economy has been shutdown for all intents and purposes.  Several hundred million have been unemployed and there is no clear sign when that will change.  Governments around the world, who can afford it but are also already deeply in debt, are printing money to hand out fantasizing that this'll somehow make a difference.

Instead of raw numbers, why doesn't the paper provide context by percentage of infected, estimated infected and total population? And how about publishing deaths for the same period last year? (We're talking worldwide.) The reality is that many of those dying from this virus are people who will not die of some other cause (at likely much higher expense by the way). This is not to say their lives are expendable or some such simplistic formulation, but to recognize that death, always hard for those involved, is inevitable no matter how much our society fails to address it. Then why don't we see some numbers about how many jobs are lost and how many billions lost from state budgets per death, per estimated life saved given estimated mortality rates? 
People panic when we think a situation is either/or: either we entirely shut down the economy or everyone dies. But we could have targeted sheltering in place. We could have nuanced discussions of rationing health care at end of life (gasp! Guess what? The rest of the world does it and so do we, to poor people only). We could recognize that most of us will indeed get this virus and that is good in order to absorb it into our collective immune capacity.

Neither does virtually everyone else.

The globe must work now to stabilize global food supplies.  Farmers are letting crops rot in the fields because commercial orders have dried up.  We should mobilize people (pay them) to harvest crops and distribute that food where it is needed.  This is a matter of national security.  If people start going hungry around the world, they will pick up guns and fight to get food.  Wars could break out.  Any conflict will ruin international cooperation and then we all lose.

Many more people have died in that time from cigarettes, pharmaceutical drugs, alcohol, and many other causes of death.  The Fear Virus has made blubbering cowards of most people.

I'd also like someone to explain to me why we bail out banks when they face financial difficulties due to their own ineptness and greed but small business America cannot get a loan when events occur beyond their control. I have a business and I'm working hard to keep my people employed and using my savings to do so. I've spent days trying to apply for a loan only for the bank to tell me the SBA can't handle the requests and for the SBA not to return calls and then for the bank to tell me that they don't have the procedures in order to process the paperwork. If I were a conspiracy theorist, I'd say the ineptness of the government and financial institutions is deliberately driven to make us all rely more on larger businesses and further exacerbate the chasm between the haves and the have-nots.

The requirements for the Paycheck Protection Program through SBA are that you must apply through a bank, then the bank requires that you have an established business checking and a business loan through them. These loans and accounts must have been in existence before Feb 15th of this year. My bank, Wells Fargo, has never opened the portal to submit the application and has stated they have already received applications for $10B in loans. If I were a more suspicious man I would seek to find out how that was possible with no portal. Yesterday, my Congressman's office advised me that the Fed has authorized Wells Fargo to lend more money. The portal, if any, remains closed. I smell a rat."

Since then all groups are provided rubber boots and a rain poncho amongst other essentials. This worldwide crisis demands that we seriously think things through.

The word ‘businessman’ conjures the image of a sly but crafty operator; someone seeking out advantageous deals and playing the field with wit and skill to advance his company. 

Trump couldn’t deal his way out of a paper bag. He cheats at the games he knows the rules to, and he loses all the same. Often billions at a time. Trump couldn’t conjure a decent party trick for a child’s birthday party. He makes other businessman look bad."

Of course Chase bank gave this money to their biggest clients first and in huge amounts that have quickly depleted the funds. This is why the Republicans are fighting to put 250 billion more in right away so they avoid transparency of distribution. Much of this money has NOT gone to the small businesses that it was intended to go to. According to what we see and hear, we know that the average small businesses are getting NOTHING as of yet and yet the fund is already depleted. SHAME on this Administration. Now they cap the loans at 15 thousand because the average small business which was the original concern of the Bill, is on line to get a loan. AMAZING but not shocking. The Banks that gave out the large loans need to be held accountable for the distribution of the original 350 Billion already spent and not where it was supposed to be. 15K woiuld not help me pay rent for a month or two. Let alone keep employees paid. This President NEVER said anything about a cap on the amount just how wonderful he was for coming to the rescue and helping small businesses. A liar and a flim flam man. Always was and if this country votes him in again, they deserve what they get. Only 10K as a grant. I use 10K to feed my dogs."

Meanwhile, Pelosi and Schumer are against the request for an additional $250 billion for PPP because they want more funding for groups covered under CARES Act who are still receiving money under that act. Thanks to these three Democrats, small businesses like mine, who are waiting in line for PPP or EIDL money, won't see anything for weeks, if at all. Shame on the NYT for not providing readers the whole story and for making Cardin out to be some kind of hero. Worthless politicians like this (on both sides) need to be removed in November. I am an Independent but probably 75% of my close friends are Democrats and I am telling every single one of them what is actually happening with these programs, and the latest antics by these three Democrat politicians, and let me tell you they are HORRIFIED by the actions of the Democrats. To be clear, Trump is not without fault, but I give him Kudos for attempting to throw an unprecedented life line to small businesses only to have the whole thing mucked up by greedy banks, greedy politicians, and greedy big businesses who are first in line to receive free money they don't really need."

Of course it will take about 3 weeks to understand the regs and post timelines and then another ""few"" weeks to actually get the system running. (This federal money called the PUA goes through the states) and then a few more to have any results so maybe 3 months from now sole proprietors will get some assistance.
New Mexico supposedly gave $750 to 2000 sole proprietors Wed and TH.  Did the head of the state's head of the Dept of Workforce Solutions even mention this payout at a webinar on WED? Of course NOT!!!  Because the politically connected would not have gotten their hands in the trough.  There were so many people at the site it crashed and again no notice of when it was available again--but there were those who knew the exact minute to log in and claim the PRIZE.

The purpose of a small business loan or grant is to pay YOUR employees and not yourself. Title II of the CARES Act also allows her to file for unemployment as well and get the additional $600 per week. To me this is why they are having so many issues, because people like Ms. Kelsey who are trying to take advantage of the system to pay for HER bills. The money should be reserved for ""real businesses"" that are staying open while struggling to make payroll instead of for one's own rent and bills."

The country is too large and too diverse.  Washington DC is too political and bureaucratic.  In the recent democratic primary debates, candidates proposed ""one-size fits all"" nationwide solutions to everything from minimum wage to child care.  These are important programs, but ones that would be much better addressed at the local level.  During this crisis, state governors are stepping up and solving problems.  We should continue this trend.  Washington DC has its hands full with defense and diplomacy.  We should be pushing our state & local governments to provide the services (and the regulatory framework) that local communities need, tailored to suit those localities.

Remember the roll-out of the computer system for the ACA? The fighter that would flip upside down south of the equator? The Hubble mirror?

But my thought is that while a small business loan sounds good, how many businesses have enough extra money to pay off the loan in a normal period of time? Most I know of can balance the salaries and inventory and rent and overhead, and while the owners can make a decent living, most don't have a home in the Hampton's to go hide out at.
Probably don't waste money on cruises.

It's going to take a lot of haircuts, or knife sharpening, or dog grooming, or ... to cover the loan."

I have called twice and both times the SBA reps have sounded puzzled by the first digits of my confirmation numbers but said if I have a confirmation number, I'm good.

I am thinking that is what they can distribute with their current funding, not what they can do with the $350B new funds.  My guess is that the new funds are not yet available but also it was very irresponsible of the SBA people to discourage those in need of the assistance.

We have applied online for the disaster assistance.  We need both short term debt converted to long term debt as well as payroll assistance.  The application did not mention anything but the personal information of us and our business.  No financial or requests for our needs.  The form said that the SBA would request what information they needed to complete our request for a loan.  No word to date."

As the owner of a couple small businesses I wish there was a simple process for borrowing at the interest rates big banks pay; like 1%.  If my business can stay alive things will go back to normal at some point.  Thing is the methodology of 2.5 times payroll doesn't actually address larger issues.  My clients have stopped paying us so we can't pay our suppliers.  All of my employees are collecting unemployment (so far no $600.00 extra per week) and know they can come back to work as soon as things return to something approximating normal.

We are stuck in economic grid lock.  We can't pay because we are not being paid.  

The branch of government that is best equipped to send out money to every business in the country is the IRS.  Loan me one year of sales based on my last three years of sales and I can go back to work.  The IRS knows everything there is to know about every person and business in the country.

If you're answer is ""yes"", you haven't been paying attention since Regan jokingly uttered the ""9 most terrifying words in the English language"" and his sycophants started on their long-term strategy to drown the government in a bathtub.

You can't help but feel sorry for the poor SBA staff. It was obvious when the CARES Act was passed: the SBA does not have the scale, capacity, or expertise for administering this program.

It’s now the 10th of April.  Called again last week and  SBA said fill out another application, still nothing.  Our local banks not accepting anymore applications for Payroll protection programs.  Unemployment still pending after three weeks.  My question now is where is the money? No one said a word about the banks picking and choosing who gets help and who doesn’t.

Understandable.  However, the management is either ignorant of the program they are charged to run or trying to undermine the entire stimulus, which for small businesses, has been focused on narrowly defined funds in the Payroll Protection Program (PPP). PPP uses small business owners as vectors to their employees to get cash (for two months).  HOWEVER, running a company requires much more in working capital over time than employees.  If money would flow, as it must, to the business owners (who are willing to take the obligation), the entire program has a chance.  If not, as this stupid $15k limit is, then it all fails, because there won't be jobs to bring employees.  Business owners will take PPP loans and then not meet the forgiveness rules -- they will go into debt.  The little understood EIDL Program is itself a disaster a management there really should resign out of frustration or be fired for cruel stupidity,  The SBA offers a person in the guillotine a futile hope for rescue, then tortures  that person just before execution.

That being able to give a smile to a passerby, or neighbor is a lovely thing that I would hate to see erased by a sense of fear based living. In my mind, if these pandemics and virus outbreaks are becoming more common, which it appears they are, we need to take a cold hard look at the way humans are interacting with the planet, and specifically the animal world, which is where these viruses are springing from. I would much rather do that, then shroud my face, smile, and humanity in a futile attempt to slow the spread of a virus.

I found it valuable to read of some cultural differences between Asia’s mask wearing in contrast to Western European and American views.

What is lightly touched upon as an additional purpose of the mask wearing is climate change. Throughout much of Asia there is significant air pollution making even breathing a dangerous thing, but the mask can help provide some benefit to shield from some of the pollutants. In addition many of us living on the west coast in California last year found ourselves wearing masks when the air was filled with choking smoke from wildfires helped along by climate change.

In these times mask wearing should be encouraged to help each other’s health."
2020-04-10 16:11:36,"As the article points out, prior to the SARS pandemic in 2003, Asian did not wear masks.  Wearing masks is alien to the common humanity culture regardless of Western individualism or Eastern collectivism.  The practice of wearing masks continued first in China and later in many Asian countries after the SARS pandemic was due to air pollution.  Modern life fueled by the burning of fossil energy and recently with the emergence of deadly pathogens are the price we pay by covering our face."
2020-04-10 17:30:18,I just like to correct the notion that mask-wearing is a post-SARS phenomenon in Japan. People wore masks in case of a cold to protect other from catching the illness at least as far back as in the 80s when I grew up in the country.

I did my weekly grocery shopping at my usual store this morning. They are limiting the number of customers in the store at one time. But there were probably two dozen staff stocking shelves all over and most were not wearing masks. About half the customers had some face covering but many were wearing them incorrectly. VERY few men, staff or customers, had any mask at all. 

People were not careful enough about social distancing either. The store has made all the aisles “one-way” with large, taped arrows on the floor. People were not heeding that directive and the aisles are not wide enough to allow 6 ft for passing. 

On Monday, any open stores and food take-outs in my area will begin requiring everyone, staff and customers, to wear masks. Staff will also wear gloves. All this is long overdue. I have been covering my face and using gloves and social distancing for weeks already, because I know biology. 

I have now started to sew washable cotton masks for my own and extended family, and whatever extra I can manage. I think everyone will need to wear masks and social distance for at least a few months. Maybe longer. And maybe again if this turns out to be seasonal and returns. So, wear a mask and make it fun!"

And false protection is worse than no protection - it diverts your attention from doing other things that help. 

I’m not interested in how many countries have joined in, or whether conformity is settling in for country X - this isn’t a popularity contest or a national plebiscite. But if there’s science behind this, rather than just a bandwagon, sign me up - where’s that old bandanna I had?"
2020-04-10 17:20:50,"My rural area in the upper Midwest is not really warming to the idea of masks. I see more women than men wearing them; I'm guessing that may be because around here many of the masks people are sporting are being sewn by quilting clubs from leftover quilting fabric. Until they can get something not made from a charming floral quilt fabric, the rural men are probably going to be pretty resistant.

So all you home mask makers, time to pull out the Packers and Bears and Harley print fabrics and get the too-macho-to-wear-gingham guys on board too!

Cover the bridge of your nose, mouth and below your chin with the mask 

Don’t touch, adjust, move or mess with the mask when outside. 

Take it off in a designated area back at home. 

Wash your hands

With a reusable mask: boil water, add some soap, put the mask in for 10 min (paper below indicates 5 min at 160 F inactivated the virus in a lab setting)

Wash your hands

Rinse with water and air dry. 

Oh and wash your hands!

Stay safe all ❤️

2020-04-10 15:33:59,Pandemic chic. Wow!
2020-04-10 17:07:00,I wouldn't call masks a fashion.  at least not to us westerners. it's more like the cone of shame that dogs wear.  except our shame is in the failure of our world leaders.
2020-04-10 18:35:27,"Pollution. Microparticles. That's one of the reasons people on the Asian continent have steadily continued to wear masks between epidemics. Because around the world governments have been unable to bring microparticles levels to a healthy level. Studies show that the hearts of young city dwellers contain billions of toxic air pollution particles.  Nanoparticles  present in human brains were associated with Alzheimers-like damage, another disease linked to air pollution. As a matter of fact air pollution from petrol and diesel vehicles is likely to increase mortality from the novel coronavirus in cities so masks are here to stay."
2020-04-10 16:23:21,"In Tokyo, it is really cool to see well dressed people going about their daily tasks weraing masks, like it was part of their attire. I was amazed ta how cosmopolitan and exciting the city is when I visited. Can’t wait to go again. Collectively, humnaity should find a way, based on science to survive this. Cover up - to protect you and society, self isolate."
2020-04-10 17:15:27,"Face masks maybe one reason why viruses are getting more virulent. Many people seem to have been already wearing face masks even before the crisis. Effectively this means that virus that spreads will be more potent. Essentially, face masks can not be the effective solution any more than carrying an oxygen tank would be, clean air is."
2020-04-10 15:30:08,"Why no mention of how much money they actually make? Not even a ballpark? $20 a day or $2,000 a day?

That would seem to be key information for understanding this story."
2020-04-10 15:50:07,"Wow, I’m glad this type of thing never interested me, hard to imagine people paying to see them sans clothes, no offense intended but there must be some other way to make money online without humiliating  yourself and others,  how about online teaching of  basic English, there is certainly a need for that."
2020-04-10 16:40:38,"I have heard that the Netflix movie ""Cam"" is a pretty authentic look at the life of an online sex worker (apart from the supernatural thriller element, at least I hope.) I found it fascinating and would recommend it to anyone curious about how this works."
2020-04-10 14:44:34,"So earnings are “static”?  I think many people would like their earnings to be “static” with the past. But these workers can always apply for unemployment compensation. The  Federal government will pay them an additional $600 a week. And in some states, persons who are in the USA illegally qualify for benefits paid from government funds."
2020-04-10 17:24:35,"Thanks, NYT, for doing this story...the first I've seen in any major media dealing with the workers most affected by ""distancing""."
2020-04-10 17:57:43,Age was unnecessary to the story and I did not like the word count dedicated to explaining that they didn't want to share it. Just cut all the ages and focus on the real story - their lives and how coronavirus impacts them. Otherwise good story!
2020-04-10 18:07:15,"Dear People,

Welcome to the economics of laissez-faire capitalism where the little up and coming person competes vicious revenue downward circle environment and big corporations insulate themselves from competition through vertical integration and direct (from the people) government links.

Good luck"
2020-04-10 18:13:44,"I agree with a lot of the comments, that this was a worthy article. I also appreciate having just a tiny bit of titillation in the Times! Adds a little variety to the news, as did the article in the Magazine about Weird Al Yankovic, for example. I loved that and I'm not a fan of Weird Al, just appreciate his long recording and performing history. Anyway, this was an interesting article, especially in these days of sheltering-in-place...."
2020-04-10 18:36:45,"This is just 1 of the initial wave of changes coming into society as a result of the pandemic. As popular as the internet has become over the last 30 plus years, more business and leisure activities are moving online. But whoever thought of virtual strip clubs !?"
2020-04-10 16:12:31,"I live in Switzerland where ""sex work"" is legal and regulated. On a flight in 2018 I met a young woman from Eastern Europe who lives in Zürich, and as we chatted along, she revealed to me that she worked as a high-end escort. Far from the stereotype of the high-school dropout sex worker, she has a university degree and does her job out of personal choice - she likes what she does, and her ultimate dream is to save enough money to start up her own business. A very smart and well-spoken girl of 25, we stayed in touch. 

Fast forward to February 2020, and Switzerland shut down all sex workers, for obvious reasons. This girl wrote to me that she was flying back home to ride out the pandemic with her family. She has enough money saved away to keep on paying her apartments in Zürich. Like many other smart high-end escorts who save their money, she can wait out several months. 

But she also told me that many girls - especially younger ones - don't have any money, can't pay for their rent, and for them going online is the only hope to survive this pandemic, since even the production of porn movies is dead in the water right now (for obvious reasons - I can't think of a job with less ""social distancing"" than that!). 

Getting to know this girl opened my eyes to the fact that sex workers are real people, real women with feelings, dreams and emotions like everyone else. Instead of being fake moralistic and disapproving of what these girls do, I wish them all the best and stay safe!"
2020-04-10 15:06:09,"Interesting the absence of men, especially straight men, as there are many working-class and underclass guys who do this, often from other countries. Most guys I know do it for other men. I guess the stigma is greater so you could not find any? But also be interested if there are women--straight, gay, and bi--who pay for cam sex."
2020-04-10 18:28:00,"I'm curious as to how the workers view their jobs. What percentage love/hate it? What percentage think it's liberating vs humiliating?

Maybe it's the San Franciscan in me, but I really, really want there to be a time when our society recognizes sex workers for what they are- providing a needed, welcome respite from the ills of the world. People need what these people are providing, and exhibitionism is thought by many, many people to be very fun. I think it's admirable how many of these people can be so confident in their own skin and in their own sexuality that they can show what they are. And if they're earning a living while doing this? More power to them. Do you."
2020-04-10 14:27:31,"I was disappointed to see this article appear in The Friday Briefing (which I love).  I believe that this industry only furthers the demise of the #metoo movement and the acceptance of sex trafficking.  

To say that these are ""performers or models"" further promotes an industry where people are exploited on a regular basis.  Also, in this industry, when the performer is not self-employed, who are their ""employers"" and who is to say that the performers are not victims of sexual trafficking, forced into this job?"
2020-04-10 20:29:51,"Sex work is work. Sex workers deserve all the respect, especially during this difficult time, when many are trapped at home, bored, having nothing to do and nowhere to go, and in desperate need of their online service. Sex work should be considered essential. Sex workers should have all the benefits and equality. They shouldn’t be discriminated against based on gender, age or looks and they should all have job security."
2020-04-10 19:42:30,"We sex workers find it so funny when non-sex workers impose their beliefs about what type of work is exploitative on us. 

I’m an online sex worker in the US, I work part time, and I earn 6 figures annually. Many of my peers earn a lot more than I do, and there’s no real ceiling for how much you can earn: what other industries make that possible for women? 

Online sex work enables me to express my sexuality in a safe way and interact with clients in ways that deeply enrich their lives. 

Is it easy work? No. Is it wonderful every day? No. What jobs are? It’s still an excellent avenue to earn money from the comfort of my home, enjoy a flexible schedule, spend much more time with my family and loved ones, etc. 

No one gets to decide whether a form of work is exploitative, coercive, or degrading to anyone else, and it’s frankly ridiculous to suggest that camming, which represents a flexible and highly remunerated employment avenue for thousands of people, is unilaterally exploitative. Give up your tired assumptions and recognize sex work as valid and valued work."

2020-04-10 21:03:48,NO!!! Not most of us!!! Get it straight
2020-04-10 18:43:08,Is anyone willing to discuss the ethics and morality of sex work?  Does this deserve to be front page news?
2020-04-10 19:10:04,"What's with the ""many of us""..?!?? You do a lot of good work but are way too prone to exaggerating numbers and statistics, as well as overuse the word ""us"", ""we"" and ""them"". You only speak for yourself and a certain number of people' NO ONE can speak for the majority.
  Pls  consider using more modifiers, eg, ""many women"", ""some men"", few people"" etc....and I agree with some of oyur readers: by writing about this you are irresponsibly ""normalizing"" it, in the sense of young girls being exposed to this and choosing this world -- to find them selves later addicted to drugs, alcohol, abuse -- and they haven't become successful entrepreneurs. I think it also obscures the prevalence of trafficking and under-age abuses, as well as making those already in the ""industry"" feel they have to compete more, by offering more violent and/or even younger girls/boys for sale/use."
2020-04-10 19:45:38,"I've always winced at the ""exploitation"" angle of stories of this nature.  The focus is always on the females, and yes, there are  certainly females being exploited.  But in reality, the woman is in control and the men are being financially exploited by the industry.  Men are inordinately attracted to the visual nature of sexual encounters; i.e., no, men don't want to feel your brain.  It's a business reality that's created a thriving industry by exploiting men (that you don't hear complaining)."
2020-04-10 20:51:21,"“...anyone who earns money from ‘live performances of a prurient sexual nature’ is expressly forbidden to apply for disaster relief...”

And why might that be?

Donald Trump is friends with Robert Kraft, and was friends with Jeffrey Epstein. Is this an issue of feigned morality, or of preserving the integrity of sex slavery?"
2020-04-11 01:36:11,"I guess in a way this sort of work is a form of acting, and it certainly appears (from reading this article) to involve less risk than what traditional pornographic actors are subject to. But I would hope that the people in front of the camera are not subject to coercion of any kind."
2020-04-11 02:29:21,"Absolutely great reporting on a very important topic! As someone who hasn't nor has ever went on any of these sites (but also does not see the problem others apparently do about the ""most of us"" statement in the byline), I still respect and appreciate that you covered some of the nuances of such a loaded topic in society (again, as evidenced by the comments). Thank you for what you do!!!"
2020-04-11 00:04:05,"You think you don't know any sex workers but you do. We don't exist on the margins of society, we are right here, sitting next to you. You just don't know that because most of us don't tell you. Most people 50 years ago would likely say they didn't know any gay people. Well, good morning, it's time to wake up. We don't need you to like us or what we do but if you really care about reducing the exploitation of people in our industry then stop promoting laws that criminalize us. When you make people and their livelihood illegal you make them wide open to exploitation, violence, blackmail and mistreatment by truly bad people and by law enforcement. If you deny unemployment to sex workers and SBAs to strip clubs and other types of sex related businesses then you are forcing them to seek other ways to find money which will likely be meeting clients during a time when we are supposed to be social distancing. Many of those clients will try to pay less for more to take advantage of financial distress pushing the people you say you care about to do things they are not comfortable with. Many of us are fortunate to have lovely clients who have given us money as a downpayment on future encounters. I guarantee you the most vulnerable among us will not be so lucky. Hate us and hate what we do but stop parading your hypocrisy of wanting to end exploitation when your outdated draconian attitudes and laws do exactly the opposite."
2020-04-11 02:35:16,"Thank you for this article. The more facts people understand, the less stigma and fear. Demographically, and regionally, readers will understand this differently. But, it's broad and universal. One need not agree with various lifestyle choices; one need not adopt them; but, why can't we all live and let live? We're all God's children each with our unique callings."
2020-04-11 02:33:57,"I was a nude model decades ago, a male in my mid twenties, for an art class.  This happened before the magic of the internet.  I'm just curious...was I being exploited?"
2020-04-10 22:10:55,I see that there is a stigma attached to sex work. What a shame.
2020-04-10 22:12:07,Don't watch porn! It is a vile exploitative industry. The only porn people should consume is audio porn. No need for abuse and exploitation of people in that. Think about it.
2020-04-11 12:36:41,"Several points:

Holding moral objections to sex work is a personal opinion some people may choose to have.  But branding as expoitative an online platform that allows people to:
a) sign up voluntarily, 
b) enter their own address/bank information to receive payments, and 
c) post or stream self-produced content from home at the hours of their choosing 
is hugely illogical.  

Imagine a situation in which a YouTube performer was exploited -- sure, it could happen, but if it did, it would have nothing to do with the platform or the nature of the work.  

Second, never underestimate the variety of human sexuality.  Traditionally explicit material may be a huge part of cam and adult fan site content, but my own OnlyFans followers sign up to see me exercising in a bikini.  

Online platforms give people enormous scope to produce, share, monetize, and consume media within their areas of interest and comfort.  When I'm done posting this, I'll be off to ""exploit"" my ability to stay employed and stay in shape while stuck at home for the past month.

And, last, to the individual who said ""If ever there were a non-essential job, this is it"" -- how essential would you say it is to keep as much of the economy functioning as possible during this crisis?  Isn't any job that can continue be done safely pretty essential for applying some counterweight to rampant unemployment and insecurity?"
2020-04-11 03:50:31,"Who knew there were so many prudes in this country?  

Americans watch more pornography per capita than any other nation.  Get over yourselves . . . and while you're at it, learn to treat other human beings with dignity.  

Sex workers' labor is just as legitimate as any other."
2020-04-11 12:10:24,"I would love to believe that for every online sex worker, there are customers who are not assaulting others because they the worker is an outlet for their deprivation, especially in countries and cultures with the rigid sex laws and mores. Unfortunately, the research on this is very mixed, so my wish to believe is just that."
2020-04-10 21:20:36,"From the ages of 18-40 I had multiple career paths. Commercial insurance, ESL school (administration) and finance (administration as well). During these years I had a second lucrative career as a “porn star” that paid my mortgage 20 years early and allowed me to sell right before the ‘07 crash, bank half a mile and escape the true rape of my talents and abilities. Still did porn. Because I wanted to.

It can be a choice and one that respects our own ability to choose how we are used for our mental and physical attributes."
2020-04-11 09:11:04,Prostitution is the world’s oldest profession.   That’s not just an expression.  We can’t ever eliminate it.  We can only regulate it and try to protect the people involved.
2020-04-11 04:33:05,To those who fault these cyber sex workers for their choices in life: your feelings of moral superiority do you no credit. Your total lack of understanding and generosity vis a vis men and women who are lawfully attempting to make the best use of their talents and abilities suggests you may have some personal problems that could perhaps be identified if not completely overcome with the judicious use of mild hallucinogens such as psilocybin mushrooms if psychoanalysis doesn't quite fit in the budget.
2020-04-10 16:37:19,"It seems like it would be really lonely work, hour after hour alone, with a screen with a disembodied voice on other end. As a former sex worker, i.e., stripper, escort, and dominatrix, for about 7 years, I couldn’t deal with the grossness of it all, without doing tons of heroin. I gave my best years to people who didn’t care about me, although I justified it at the time. My mental health, relationships, and love life didn’t thrive until I was far, far away from that lifestyle. Maybe I was just too sensitive to thrive in that business. One has to be really detached to walk away from it intact. Even opioids didn’t prevent a soul-sucking experience. It creeps up on you. Depression sets in. Especially when the money matches your mood, but it’s all you got."
2020-04-10 19:31:40,"People in this industry have always existed on the margins. They are entrepreneurially smart - not to mention safe and calling their own shots with camming.

Honestly - considering the untold millions (billions?) this industry generates annually - its really time we finally bury our stupid judgemental holier-than-thou Puritan (insert word here) – and recognize sex work for what it is - a monumental-sized industry who's employee's are deserving of the fundemental essentials - unemployment pay, health insurance even workman's comp - all the stuff the rest of us feel ""entitled"" to."
2020-04-10 13:30:52,"Is there anything more bizarre than the great capitalist himself (Donald Trump) manipulating the long-broken oil ""free"" market and demanding higher prices in the middle of this global pandemic?  

US shale production must be saved!  The billionaire hedge fund managers have ordered it so.

In the midst of all this oil madness, there was the Saudi oil executive on TV the other day simply pointing out that if we are to reduce global oil production, shouldn't the most expensive production (US shale) be reduced first?  Of course this will not happen as it is just too free market for the US oil industry."
2020-04-10 13:49:47,"So let me get this straight. We (the USA) wants oil prices to be higher, which will increase the price of gasoline to consumers during possibly the worst financial crisis since the depression, when unemployment is at 13 percent. We want this in order to save shale oil producers, which use millions of gallons of water for each well and poison the environment. Simultaneously, we will be increasing the profits made by some of our worst enemies (Russia, Iran) and some of our most dubious “allies” (Saudi Arabia). This is after we have already filled the “strategic” oil reserves with millions of gallons of oil that in a lot of ways is somewhat obsolete and not needed in 2020. 
Correct?"

If you raise prices, raise the tax so we can have infrastructure projects.  Employee people not management/owners."
2020-04-10 13:59:09,Subsidies for oil and gas must end in 2020 if the humans of the world are going to survive until the end of the century.  Everyone keeps asking how to solve climate change.  This is step one.  Until we rebalance the focus on clean energy we will be forever dying on this gerbil wheel of unsustainable energy resources and production.

2020-04-10 13:49:34,"Yeah let’s jack up oil prices just when 20 million Americans are newly unemployed. Yeah, that’ll work. Hedge funders first, everyone else can just eat that tasty shale."
2020-04-10 14:34:46,"Artificially controlling production to control the prices. This is exactly why oil should not be subsidized or a traded commodity. Imagine if all the corn growers decided to stop farming as a means of jacking up prices - simply because their profits are not maxing out the way they want to. There would be blood in the streets. So why not something that literally powers much of the world? At a time like this, shouldn’t governments be urging more oil production and a lowering of prices across the board to help the citizens of the planet, and not just the Saudis. Putin, and Trump’s buddies?"
2020-04-10 14:58:17,"It will a surprise to expect China's recovery to be in trouble.  Lower oil price benefits Chinese domestic markets a lot.  China is heavily rely on importing oil to propel its huge industrial output and vast automobile usages.  Lower oil price should help reducing the costs.  

In addition, A short 77-days of a V-shaped recovery should also cause minimum damages to the economy.  Already loads of people are rushing back to jobs and earning income.  Consumer activities are gradually resuming and recovering.  

Anyway, a good Chinese recovery will put a positive spin on our own recovery in the near future.  Nonetheless, China will serve us as a model to consider and modify for our own usage."
2020-04-10 15:01:25,"In my humble opinion, the petro-dictatorships and oil cartels will collapse. 

If you think energy consumption has recently slowed, imagine 6 months or probably more of continuing global inactivity.

The economic hurt is just getting started for the oil producers."
2020-04-10 15:06:06,In the end the OPEC + Russia cut backs won't increase oil prices for several reasons.  The world uses about 100 million barrels a day whereas they now only provide 44 million of it.  It's a buyers market.  Demand down 25%.  There are a lot of other Non OPEC sellers that need the $ and are willing to sell at low prices and take market share from OPEC + Russia.   Basically OPEC + Russia can no only control enough supply to fix prices when they can only cut 10 million barrels a day supply when the global demand is down about 25 million barrels a day.  How do I feel about this.  I'm absolutely giddy!! It's great.  Of course Trump is trying to protect his oil buddies like the Koch brothers; profits over people.
2020-04-10 15:15:58,Why are they manipulating the oil market now with decreased use and employment loses-- average people are benefiting.But not Trump and Putin's Russian Oligarch buddies and so he has been out trying to help raise the price of gas to help them increase their income during the pandemic.

2020-04-10 15:26:26,"Oil production cuts to push up prices.  More welfare for business at a cost to the consumer.

2020-04-10 16:11:44,"AP captures the dynamics in two sentences: ""The oil market was already oversupplied when Russia and OPEC failed to agree on output cuts in early March. Analysts say Russia refused to back even a moderate cut because it would have only served to help U.S. energy companies that were pumping at full capacity.""

The US has flooded the market with oil from fracking for years, and then had the gall to demand that other producers lower their output. Claiming that it couldn't lower its own output because of its laws against being part of a cartel was a flimsy excuse. It's just as much about market share for the US as it is for all the others, and forcing the others to cut production would have been a boon to US producers. COVID-19 has put a stop to that game."

They wanted to remove protection for the Alaskan National Wildlife Reserve, expand drilling off shore, expand fracking: so that by producing more of our oil we would not be affected by OPEC.

2020-04-10 20:57:39,"Let me get this straight.  When it was a question of making ventilators to save lives, Trump did not want to invoke the Defense Production Act because “We're a country not based on nationalizing our business.""  But when it's a question of getting a ""win"" and helping his Saudi and Russian pals to close a deal, he's ready to set up an oil ministry to tell Exxon how much it can bring to market."

I gotta wonder how that’s not a violation of HIPAA. How do they know who’s had the virus or not? Only the appropriate government authorities and the patient’s healthcare provider should know that. The only thing the public should know is total number of cases. And that’s it. At no time should a third part tech company be able to pick out individuals based on medical diagnosis, and flag them against other people. It’s wildly abusive!"

I thought under the US anti trust laws it is illegal for US competitors in a market to actively collude to fix the price in the market.  Essentially, these laws prohibit business practices that unreasonably deprive consumers of the benefits of competition, resulting in higher prices for products and services.  Cooperatively agreeing to production cuts to increase prices is exactly that.  Isn't Trump openly giving the US oil companies a pass on this?!?"

There must be times when he realizes he doesn't understand the situation, but still is compelled to add his circular, meaningless spin into the conversation.

While the US rolls out vast sums of money through the Congress and the Fed to get billions to corporate America.  Trump has taken away the person who was to oversee the spending of the Congress' stimulus plan leaving serious questions on whether Trump and Mnuchin will distribute the money to the most necessary places.  The fact that the stock market registers the immediacy of their position to the political and banking leaders in the gov't. is disconcerting.

As the air clears and   people are seeing views of the Himalayas, not seen in thirty years, I think people are realizing, we have to think a little more locally.  We can't just offshore our factories to a few third world countries.  We can't just have whatever we want and throw it away when we're done.  We are defining ourselves as people and this idea of harmonious globalism isn't gonna cut it.  Borders will tighten, we will make our own stuff again, we will make it so it can be re-used and not thrown away.  In the end we will be stronger.  The real loser in this new war, will be China, because the rest of the world has seen the Emperor without his clothes.  The one thing that the US previously offered (in addition to money) was leadership.  Not this time.  There is no such thing as American exceptionalism, and we are no better than a third rate banana republic under this president.  As we are all ready seeing, the money being poured into the US economy, will have little oversight and will flow to the usual suspects.  The question remains, who will fill the vacuum.  It won't be Putin, he's brutal, but not clever.  I think we will see a new world order, one that looks a lot more like Denmark, than Texas.  We will do with less, we will do better."

2020-04-09 11:35:08,"The WHO's pandemic surveillance program is funded from that organisation's compulsory membership fees ('assessed contributions'). The total budget is $525 million - yes, that little.

The largest contributor of WHO membership fees is the European Union bloc, $129 million. The US pays $124 million, China $40 million. (2108/19 figures).

The WHO also receives intermittent voluntary donations. These make up 81% of all the WHO's total money. Donor countries (US, UK and Germany, principally) and organisations (e.g. Gates Foundation, World Bank, European Commission, Global Vaccine Alliance) stipulate ('earmark') donations for specific projects. American cash made up 15% of all voluntary donations 2018/19. NONE of the US donations were donor earmarked for Coronavirus research.

I guess President Trump toned down the anti-WHO rhetoric when the reality of US funding was explained to him. Looks to me, at least, that China - one of the world's three largest economies -ought to be coughing up a lot more basic WHO funding. But not because the USA 'owns' the WHO. It obviously does not."

It would have been the W.H.O.‘s preeminent role to strongly push science to deliver asap a wide spectrum anti-viral therapeutic/therapy which might be at least partially effective against new viruses. The knowledge gained with previous viruses would have been an excellent platform to do so. At the time nothing was really done with some degree of conviction, the flu is still considered as something to live with, and the highly paid W.H.O. bureaucrats in Geneva certainly failed miserably in this respect (and maybe others)..."

2020-04-09 14:51:15,"To be honest, all the governments try to politicize WHO and COVID-19. The reason I believe is because WHO largely rely on the funding from those rich and powerful countries, which limit its independent role in taking effective measurements. However, without these findings, WHO cannot be operated. Just like FAA and CDC, gradually those so-called third party institutes would lose its independent roles until the next wave of reshuffle comes."

While I object to racist slurs (Taiwan denies any government involvement in racism), and to Trump’s efforts to focus attention on WHO to cover up his incompetent administration’s response to the virus (talk about sleepy), there is something wrong with WHO when it refuses to discuss or help Taiwan during a pandemic.  The video looks like something out of 1983.  

WHO needs to focus on medicine to help everyone on the planet, including people living in Taiwan.  It appears that Taiwan has been more effective than most countries at controlling the virus, but WHO hides the data within statistics reported about all of China, still claiming that China has done a good job fighting the virus."

When this Institute, and its leading voice flashed red at the beginning of 2020, a rarity for a non-alarmist foundation, this reader of the daily News Bulletin started to wake up to the reality that this could happen here.

If our last president had received notice of the above, when it was circulating the world, he would have been on the phone with Dr. Tedros listening and asking for more information, followed by a closed panel of health experts before addressing the Nation, without pretending it was a hoax.

Voters do not care if President Trump is at odds with WHO, and far more tuned in with the devastation that this plague is wreaking across our country.

-  Hats Off to Dr. Tedros and WHO;
-  To Chancellor Merkel of Germany;
-  To Governor Cuomo and his ongoing efforts;
-  To scientists and medical workers world-wide in a concerted effort to save lives and work to find a vaccine;
-  To our workers in 'essential' life trades, providing us with food and health supplies.

To our citizens, responsible and resilient, abiding by the guide-lines, and ready to pitch in with combat boots to help one another.  

To many unsung heroes, who one day may be heard; to the Child within US, growing stronger in this time of deep crisis, and to my godson in Queens, NY, 'Orpheus' for providing us with his music.

The sun will rise again."
2020-04-09 15:09:57,"In asking us not to politicize the virus, Tedros is working to insulate himself from criticisms of his malfeasance. After making incredulously preposterous statements, such as, and I paraphrase, ""prejudice surrounding the virus is worse than the virus itself,"" as well as claiming that Taiwan is a province of China, to practically working as a professional Chinese Communist Party agent to cover up the country's contemptible response to the outbreak, he and WHO are finally receiving due criticism. All of this is not to mention his sympathizing with African dictators, among other detestable acts and statements. But a Trump figure in sheep's clothing, he knows that the world does not want to hemorrhage more and does not want to bring politics into a worldwide crisis. His soothing words telling us that we should not make this political is tantamount to an abusive father telling his child not to go to the police because that would make the child's trauma worse."
2020-04-09 15:06:19,"US policy toward of one China is responsible for why the UN, and  WHO cannot recognize Taiwan. PRC was excluded for more than thirty years from joining any international organization, and Nixon acknowledged that there is only one China in the Shanghai Communique that paved the way for the US recognizing China.  US and ROC misplayed their hands decades ago.  They have no one but themselves to blame."
2020-04-09 16:06:14,"Racist, or other hateful remarks on social media are ignored b y anyone with common sense.

Unlike Dr. Tedros, chances are they occupy no positions of any consequence or influence.

Dr. Tedros has done more damage than the whole lot of them put together.

WHO data is always suspect, even more so now that the organization is clearly in thrall to PRC disinformation.

Hence, his every effort, large and small, to marginalize Taiwan.

Simply disgraceful. But what else is new?"
2020-04-09 15:27:57,"Low-information Americans who are calling for the elimination of World Health Organization are the same people who called for getting rid of the United Nations and NATO. Maybe their grandparents called for the end of the League of Nations and thought that the Marshall Plan was a dumb give away.

Too many Americans lack basic historical knowledge. Without some basic understandings of why we needed some of the essential institutions such as WHO (eradication of small pox and containment of tuberculosis and polio), it makes it so easy for someone like Donald Trump to disparage them and scapegoat them. I expect Trump to dodge his responsibilities by blaming everyone besides himself for his failures, but it’s truly frightening to see how so many Americans believe his lies and distractions. If Trump had it his way, we would not have NATO, UN, EPA, WTO, congressional oversight, offices of internal review and other institutions that Trump can’t control or bully. The immunization Americans really need is facts and knowledge from Trump’s incessant lies, falsehood, and distortions."
2020-04-09 16:27:08,"Perhaps the Palestinian worker who contracted the virus and was, you write ""dumped"" at the border actually wanted to return home?"
2020-04-09 17:06:45,"Advanced societies such as Germany & China have been accumulating data from their extensive corona testing since the pandemic became obvious in Dec. Given their investment in R&D, they can accurately monitor the ebb and flow and modulate activity based on real numbers.

America, given it's failure to respond in December, which suffers from too few test kits, has no central data collection center which aggregates data from every state & city, whose health care system fails to emphasize prevention, we were terribly unprepared for the pandemic. And it goes downhill from there. Trump's repeated denial of the seriousness and his urging of people to disregard scientific advice only exacerbated our dismal predicament.

Therefore, our recovery cannot be the fast paced, V shaped recovery occurring in China, S. Korea and Germany. Our economy will suffer needlessly and many of our citizens will die unnecessarily because of  Trump's abysmal failures. 

My worst fear is that his supporters learn nothing from this terrible expensive and reward him with 4 more years to complete his decimation of America."
2020-04-09 15:02:46,"Always, and I do mean ALWAYS, remember that Trump, his son, and his other minions said this was just the flu, the common cold, and tried to blame it on Democrats, Mexicans, the Chinese (The China virus--most of which turns out to have arrived from places in Europe) and anyone else but themselves. Many of the deaths in the US are directly, not indirectly, attributable to his own stupidity and the mendacity of his family and followers."
2020-04-09 13:34:18,"Taiwan should have been included in WHO preparations for the virus. This pandemic knows no political borders and to freeze out a nation that large should simply be unacceptable. Shame on China for not making an exception at this time and shame on WHO for kowtowing to China’s immoral demands.
Dr. Tedros’ attack today is purely malicious. He is the one with power who may have literally caused unnecessary death in Taiwan. Power matters in charges of racism. He cannot undo what has happened or escape culpability because some Taiwanese are fools."
2020-04-09 13:28:32,"I listened to numerous of the WHO news conferences. They said early and consistently, this has the potential to become a pandemic. They were clearly worried about the spread.

Declaring a health emergency, or a pandemic, follows a set of guidelines. Evidence must be obtained for a number of key features. We can criticize the requirements and decide that we should declare health emergencies and pandemics sooner, but that could lead to false alarms, which in the long run will be more damaging.

The Monday morning quarterbacking is a little over the top. If people had listened to the WHO from the beginning when they kept insisting that this could become a pandemic, rather than waiting for the pandemic to be declared, everyone would be in a better place now."

2020-04-09 18:30:48,"Germany is a more advanced society than the US.  While large portions of the US question or ignore the pleas of scientists not just about corona virus but about other harms, Germany, with Merkel setting an example, respects and implements science in what it does.  I doubt if that will change much either in the US.  Along with disregard for science, there is disregard for learning and education.  School budgets are the first cut in some states to produce tax cuts.  It is clear that many  Americans don't connect the dots in understanding the various harms that can befall us.  That makes it so easy for Donald Trump to capture their loyalty as he dismisses what we've learned about environmental harms or climate harms.  He dismissed what we already knew about harms from an epidemic present in China long enough for him have taken steps to protect us.  He did not.  The ""poorly educated,"" a group he said he likes, on whom he depends for political support, will not hold him accountable for this criminal neglect; they will instead defend him against criticism for his failure.  He is the president who makes science his political opponent."
2020-04-09 16:34:23,"Chancellor Angela Merkel, the leader of the free world, is providing excellent leadership in this global crisis.

We should applaud her each day as we also applaud the front line health workers."
2020-04-09 18:39:02,"Vielen dank, Angela!

The US death rate this morning was way higher than the day before.

If that rate continues until April 30, there will be be 283,000 cumulative US dead on that date.

One day ago, if the previous day's rate had continued,  there would have been only 211,000 dead on April 30.

So, for Boris Johnson to walk through that dark corridor and emerge slightly the worse for wear at the other end is a real affirmation of the human spirit. For Everyman, though, the fight is waged also with Trump and his poor benighted friends, with insurance companies, and with healthcare systems, none of whom have the poor sick patient in mind.

I hope Boris Johnson now has better appreciation for the UK's healthcare system and its utility to the nation. The British people have strong suspicion that Conservatives are trying to choke and bend it towards the American model. The Conservatives appear determined to copy American style corporatism/unfettered capitalism driven government policy. If so that would be unfortunate. However, all the tools appear to have been put in place and manned. UK does have a more democratic election process that may pose resistance. But that could change too. In the last election Boris Johnson employed American style electioneering a first in recent times in which Jeremy Corbin refused to participate and Labor was pummeled. There is hope in the British people who unlike as much Americans, do take to the streets if they see a threat to their way of life.
Therein is the hope."

The Trump/GOP COVID-19 plan for America is a rugby scrum between American states so as not to make the U.S. government look like it can actually do something for its citizens from the (gasp) federal level.

Nikki Haley said this week to look to your governors, not Trump. -- I.e., in this national matter of life and death, stay stovepiped within the limitations and inefficiencies of your own regional, functionally arbitrary map lines.  

Trump and Bolton dismantled our pandemic response in 2018.  Trump explained he was a businessman and didn't what thousands of people sitting around doing nothing.  He said he could get people back very quickly.

""Just in time"" delivery is not ""just in case.""  Preparedness is not ""sitting around doing nothing.""

2020-04-09 23:30:45,"A reader asked:

""Has Boris Johson received Hydroxychloroquine treatment ?""

Another reader answered:

""Probably so. The hospital he is in is involved in a study. I doubt he got the placebo!""

If Johnson’s doctors indeed are involved in a test, neither the doctor nor the patient knows whether the patient is receiving a placebo. One doctor in LA, however, reported that he's knowingly been using chloroquine on what he calls ""seriously ill’ patients. He reported that chloroquine does not work at all if the patient just takes chloroquine and nothing else, but that it's worked, for him, 100% of the time when the patient also takes a zinc-based medication with it. He reported that all of his ""seriously ill"" virus patients were, in his words, ""symptom-free"" in 8-12 hours after taking the two medications.

Probably obviously, that LA doctor was not part of any ""test,"" which requires ""double blind"" administration. But his results should be reported, as ABC-TV did (the NYT has not). I don't know whether chloroquine is the ""silver bullet"" that Trump claims it is, but it's possible that it will prove to be. I am glad the FDA is a stickler for ""double blind"" tests, but keep in mind that (1) that “stickler” attitude is the entire premise of movies such as ""Dallas Buyer's Club;"" and (2) chloroquine is being tested right now -- indeed, apparently in Johnson's hospital.

For example, there are at least 2 types of N95 masks, those with exhale valves and those without. While all N95 and better masks should be reserved for healthcare professionals dealing with patients, there are key differences in what the two main types of these masks achieve. The valved N95 masks otherwise used in construction or similar professions only protect the wearer of the mask, not anyone around them. While this is certainly reasonable right now (protect our healthcare professionals at risk), there are downsides to consider.  The reason is that the valved type of N95 masks allow exhaled air to be expelled unfiltered (easier). Thus, exhaled droplets are not necessarily captured. In contrast, N95 masks without valves do offer protection both ways, but are much more uncomfortable to wear and use, and require frequent changes due to condensation."

Under normal circumstances, because they live alone, my MIL and SIL usually join in friends' Seders. If not for the pandemic, we would not have tried this. While we'd all love for this to be over as soon as possible, the pandemic has forced us out of our comfort zone. Some good is coming from it."

That should alarm all of us. Hunger trumps anything else right now! One organization that usually feeds 2,000 kids in central Alabama is now feeding 8,000. What happens when the money runs out? I’ve been worrying about this all morning. 

Here’s what I’ve come up with — I’ve been sewing masks for nurses, but now I’m going to make them to sell, and I’m going to donate the money to the food pantries. I hope that others will start coming up with creative ways to support hungry people.

Yes, of course, we know that millions are suddenly unemployed, and there is an urgent need for Congress to address this with expanded and extended unemployment benefits, but also to adopt a Federal unemployment program, not left up to the states with their various rules and hurdles that people cannot quickly navigate. 

But beyond the raw numbers of lost jobs, where's the reporting on the lost health care benefits that many are also suffering? Where's the ""health care plans that you love""? This was the time bomb waiting to explode that Sanders has been trying to get people to understand, but apparently ""it's too expensive"". How's that working out for everyone?

There are two things that Congress must do:

1. Immediately open up Medicaid to provide coverage to all workers who have lost their health care.
2. Take up implementing Medicare For All.

Doing nothing will continue to allow people to lose their health care, and continue a system that has proven to only be concerned with profit, even in times of national emergency. Doing nothing is actually proving to be far more expensive than MFA."

It's a lot easier to lay someone off than to hire someone. _Keeping users in their jobs_ should be the first priority of any government - and it is, for the governments of pretty much all other developed countries.

But in the US, our ""business-oriented"" government prefers to just shower corporations with $$$$, and let them decide how to use it. Workers and employment are hardly the priority in the US of A.

2020-04-09 16:45:35,"The following addresses measures by Congress & the Executive Branch & not monetary easing by the Fed.

By March, the perception of the pandemic's domestic economic threat was to employment & incomes during a short period before the economy would return to normalcy. The measures adopted were predicated on that assumption. They are akin to disaster relief rather than to prevent the economic implosion of a depression.

Economic dislocation now increases & will not be resolved soon, however.   The piecemeal measures adopted or under consideration are inadequate to address pressing issues of economic implosion over this longer time-span.

To forestalling depression for a protracted period, most emergency economic measures adopted to date should transition into an emergency UBI program for the duration of the pandemic related emergency. Each resident should receive, say, $2, 000 plus $500 per dependent child each month.  Federal Government deficit spending should finance the cost during the domestic pandemic. For optimum results, payment must be universal, by right & not based on assessed need.

As the domestic economy recovers, decisions can be made in light of experience gained during the emergency whether to discontinue UBI or revise its terms so that it continues as a keystone of Federal social policy."

Are we truly an affluent society if 16 million workers - 10% of the workforce - are instantly unemployed after only 4 weeks of shut-down? Are we truly a developed nation, or are we kidding ourselves?

Our politics of selfishness and resentment of the ""other"" is diminishing this country, preventing so-called leaders from building necessary safety nets to protect citizens in times like these. Toxic politics demonize common-sense preventive measures as ""Socialism"". And when the system breaks, we do exactly that - run to socialism.

The most successful countries such as Germany realize that a mix of both systems is necessary for a stable economy and a stable society. They planned ahead and set aside funds for unforeseen events such as this. Today, their workers stay home and receive about 66% of their salaries. They have virtually no job losses, companies will simply reopen when this is over. 

So if strict Capitalism is so great for the USA, why does Socialism save it everytime it crashes? Unfortunately, no lessons will ever be learned."

Of course now, 3 weeks in, we look to the federal government, not just to the states. From 1929 to 2008 to April, 2020 the states have been overwhelmed and utterly inadequate in their responses, with or without Jared Kushner."

Look, I get the need to call attention to this and rub it in Trump’s smug face, but many of these job losses are transient and due entirely to the response to COVID-19. What’s more worrying is how this might spur more companies to look to automation or “grocer-less” grocery stores, etc. to weather the next pandemic."
2020-04-09 17:26:36,"Governor Cuomo is not driving sufficient action on fixing the broken unemployment benefits system. Currently, the claims process requires at least two steps: the completion of an online application, and follow-up with a call to a claims agent. The second step is nearly impossible to complete. A more generous stimulus package will have no effect if people can't access the funds.

One NY resident has noted that it took him over 900 calls before he could speak to an agent and complete I have personally called the line 79 times since Tuesday morning. The calls result in either a busy signal or a maze of convoluted menus and instructions before an abrupt disconnection.

It's time to stop praising Cuomo's communications skills and hold him accountable for fixing this broken system, immediately. All of the Roosevelt quotes and daughter stories and cabin fever prescriptions and interruptions of ""Meet the Press"" aren't going to sufficiently polish his persona if he fails to deliver benefits to his citizens. We're staying at home. We're listening to your words, and we're also watching your actions. Please get us our financial assistance. You have no one to blame but yourself for this mess."

I and many of my colleagues have tried applying for unemployment.  The response from the NJ site as been ""application pending"" for over a week.  We are told we must first be denied by the regular unemployment system then they will consider independent contractors. 

We have applied for EIDL loans.  Dead silence.  We have tried to apply for PPP loans.  The banks won't even accept our applications as we don't have business checking accounts.  There are tens of thousands of us in this same situation.  It feels hopeless.  Yet I'm blessed compared to so many others.  God help us all because the government surely is not doing so."

We have built an economic system that can build vast fortunes, but we have failed to prepare ourselves for any of the risks that come with a vastly interconnected and interdependent society.  The awful truth is that our system is extremely fragile, and we need to rebuild, redesign and think in the long term rather than instant gratification."

I'm in regular contact with about half a dozen friends in NYC alone who have either lost their full time jobs or had all freelance gigs canceled for the foreseeable future. For weeks now none of them have been able to file for unemployment benefits because the phone lines are jammed and the website keeps crashing.

2020-04-09 17:54:52,"Much of this could have been avoided had it not been for an inept government. A national quarantine should have been declared. Those workers who were not essential should have had their basic needs covered by the government: food and medical. Those businesses that closed should have been allowed to stop paying payroll and payroll tax. But like what happens on jury duty, they would not be allowed to fire anyone. All bills for things such as rent, mortgage, utilities and insurance would be suspended by law until the quarantine is lifted. And then as people gradually begin to return to work, those bills could be gradually paid off over 12-24-36-48 month period. But the current plan—which can charitably be described as chaotic—involves numerous agencies and ill-equipped private banks attempting to douse a conflagration by desperately trying to spray it with trillions of dollars, while the fire hydrants are bureaucratically clogged. The result? Mass unemployment. Business collapse. Food lines. (And for those who comment that my framework benefits from 20-20 hindsight, I wrote the gist of this nearly 5 weeks ago.)"

Even with the $1,200 payments that will be coming, many families are struggling to put food on the table right now.  Yesterday, there was reporting that food pantries now have to purchase groceries at regular prices (rather than receiving donations) and some food distribution organizations are having to turn people away.  Let's help them.

The sole control at the wheel of this transformation basically is gone, and it’s not coming back. Unemployment Insurance last year was a disaster waiting to happen; in TN, the benefit per week, as it remains today, is $275. per week, maximum.  And actual receipt of even that paltry sum took 8 weeks or more, if you were lucky and did not have the payments blocked by clumsy, obsolete algorithms deployed by the Social Security Administration system.  The UI clerk typed in error 1 number of your SSN or DOB, and then you are persona non grata, no benefits for you. Just try to get that corrected; understandably, most people give up. In most cases of complicated upgrades or refresh of data fields for the new $600. additions to benefits will be sabotaged by veteran UI folks out of a crazy fear that the New Deal programs will put them out of a job, as they still believe, as good Republicans do, that Hawaiian statehood never should have been approved."

Only something like 10% of the bailout is going to the people.  The rest is going to the 1%.  Our leaders are failing us by standing up for wall street first, and rewarding misallocation of capital.

This is harmful on many levels.  Mainly: one, it will create an even larger divide in wealth, and two, it allocates capital to companies who acted recklessly by over-leveraging themselves.  So, the government is picking winners and losers, and it's funneling money to companies who should fail.  This works out well for the 1%, but this inefficiency will lower our standard of living in the future.

We are getting fleeced!  Our leaders are really pathetic.  Both Democrats and Republicans."

Its a big big toll and sacrifice to pay when everyday that goes by we see the impact of COVID is significantly less than the fear mongering numbers public health experts and officials were putting out in order to justify the complete shut-down of an economy.  We were told millions would die, even with social distancing.  now we might see 40,000, of which 80+% are dying from underlying conditions.  Instead, we now will get people dying from not receiving vital heatlhcare due to being scared of going to the hospital, or deferring vital checks/screens (ie no early cancer screenings going on...).

""Texans will not be penalized for a delay due to call or user volume. Claims for individuals affected by COVID-19 are eligible to be backdated. Staggering claims will provide help to reduce frustrations for many Texans and provide better access to needed services"".

So, it sounds like if you can prove COVID-19 that they'll eventually backdate, otherwise YOU WILL BE PENALIZED because your call can't get through.  Just apply online, right?  

""Your answers to the initial questions determine whether you can apply for benefits using the Internet or if you have to call the TWC Tele-Center at 800-939-xxxx.""

How many can't apply on-line due to Abbott's Catch 22?  I'm not applying, so I don't know WHICH initial questions.  But, the Call Center is non-responsive due to TOO MANY WITH NO OTHER AVENUE!

So, fix it, Abbott.  Your staggering of calls is an intentional bad solution allowing THE CLAIMS BOTTLENECK TO CONTINUE.  Stop your ruse by expanding access or be gone."

One fact from the 2008 Financial Crisis was how slow the rate of return was for mass re-employment.   Also, if you leave out the growth of contingent jobs and gig workers, the net new jobs growth has been tiny over the past 10 years, according to a Harvard study.

Sadly, many of these jobs just aren't coming back at all -- due to naturally occurring forces of attrition and automation.  Over time, companies adapt to do more with fewer workers, especially after deep recessions.

So, in crisis mode, any and all ideas ought to be seriously considered -- none should be rejected our of hand...

Some sort of UBI ought to be implemented -- at least in trial form.  Too many occupations are highly vulnerable to shocks like the one we're in right now.....

So-called ""green investment"" could create millions of new jobs -- new employment in wind, solar, wave energy is a wise investment now

Infrastructure jobs, yes, but also jobs in parks and land restoration, climate mitigation, tree planting, carbon sequestration

So far in 2020, with 500,000 cases of Covid-19, the U.S. has spent $4.3 Trillion in stimulus and counting. Mass lockdowns have cost millions of jobs, shuttered thousands of small businesses, and evaporated career hopes of our youth."
2020-04-09 22:12:11,"Like our healthcare and education systems, we've opted to spend an enormous sum of money on a problem and are receiving only mediocre results in return. The stimulus package should have been kept as simple as possible. Checks should be cut to all tax payers and citizens. Everyone should also automatically be eligible for Medicare for at least the next 12 months. Does everyone need a check or Medicare? No, myself included. However the advantage of putting cash directly into the hands of the people is that the people are consumers and ours is a consumer fueled economy. People like me who don't need the money are going to spend it and we're going to spend it at businesses who have seen their revenues collapse. This in turn helps prevent closures and layoffs. When a group as diverse as  Yang, Sanders, Romney and Mnuchin all agree on an approach it's probably worth doing!"

2020-04-09 22:20:11,"I have read every one of these articles and follow closely developments in the tri state area and I have yet to see a public employee or teacher lose a job.  In Conn the governor issued an executive order that no teacher, secretary, janitor can be laid off..State workers have a no layoff clause and I know many who have forwarded their phone and answer email but initiate nothing. City hall is open, you need an appointment for zoning, etc but no cars in lot despite pay.  I think 17% of workers are public which means the unemployment rate among the 83% of private sector workers is almost 20% higher than reported as public is at zero.  How is this fair and I know airplane pilots sweating bullets white government paralegals and phys ed teachers are landscaping their houses.  This is not fair."
2020-04-09 22:22:02,"There have been 16,444 Covid-19 related deaths reported. Meanwhile, ""more than 16 million U.S. workers, or nearly 1,000 workers per 1 death have lost their jobs. That ratio is destined to become exponentially greater the longer cowardly governors demand that their constituents shut down businesses to protect them from accusations of putting commerce before human life.  Indeed, ""several economists expect that by the end of the month more than 20 million people will have been thrown out of work, pushing the unemployment rate toward 15 percent"". How many of them will succumb to suicide or addiction as a sense of hopelessness overcomes them? Is their sacrifice worth it to save 1%? It's a question that must be answered. 

It must be answered in light of the fact that the exponential increase in death rates from Covid-19 foretold by infectious disease gurus like Dr. Anthony Fauci and ""expert"" modelers who warned that as many as 2.2 million Americans would lose their lives if draconian measures were not implemented have thus far failed to materialize. More importantly, current trend lines and estimates indicate they won't. 

Conversely, the social and economic fall out from shutting down the US economy are just beginning to be felt. Those highlighted in this article are the proverbial ""canary in the coal mine"". Politicians would be well advised to acknowledge their mistake in accepting flawed projections and instead address the impact their flawed decrees have wrought."
2020-04-09 22:23:34,"This week my husband filed for unemployment benefits for the first time in his life. He's 39 and has worked forty or more hours every week since he was eighteen, including while putting himself through college, all the way to his terminal degree. Circumstances beyond our control wiped out our savings late last year and we were just starting to replenish what we had lost. 

Now we are raising a family at 50% of our income while we wait for whatever he will receive in unemployment benefits. He cannot find a job. Amazon, Walmart, Pizza Hut, Uber Eats, everything within a 100 mile radius of our home has been taken up by the massive wave of lay-offs in the restaurant industry. Walmart would rather have an energetic 20 year old former waiter stocking shelves than a nearly 40 year old academic who hasn't worked retail in ten years. 

We are doing our part, following the rules, but this will knock us off our feet for a long time. We both went through undergrad during the initial post 9/11 recession, earning jobs paying 25K with a college degree. We had finally gotten ourselves established when the 2008 crisis hit. We both lost everything and by 2011 were crawling back to academia to improve our chances. After years of pulling ourselves up by the bootstraps, we finally thought we were about to break even. Now this. 

We never would have dreams that two people in their late thirties with almost forty years of combined full time work and combined seven college degrees would be here."
2020-04-09 22:30:43,"Europeans seem to have had a better idea on how to ensure people maintain their incomes. Rather than having people apply for unemployment benefits, countries in Europe are working with companies to pay worker’s salaries. That should reduce the risk of companies permanently laying off their workforce and essentially forcing them on the dole.

I’m not sure why the US chose a different path, although perhaps is was the political perception that companies were being helped but workers were not. As it turns out, companies are getting a rather large bail out.

On a related note, airlines will get a bail out based on showing their losses during this period. To ensure they get the maximum amount, some airlines (like Alaska Airlines) are starting to fly routes that they suspended even though THERE ARE NO PASSENGERS ON THE AIRCRAFT. That way the airline can show the flight as a loss. If the aircraft sat on the ground an airline wouldn’t be able to make that claim. Personally, I see that as gaming the system, and it is galling when the airlines have been making billions in profits these past five years."
2020-04-09 22:47:41,"This is the meltdown of decades of the patchy, inadequate, or racialized social programs dictated by GOP policy, which holds that corporations have more of a right to make money than workers do to have secure wages, health coverage, and sick leave."
2020-04-09 22:49:01,"16 million. That's nearly 5% of the total US population of 330 million. Lost their jobs in the last what, month? All of those 16 million were gainfully employed before now. 

The official statistic of 2019 was very close to 157 million employed in the US at that time. That puts the newly unemployed at over 10% of that number. Adding another 3% for the just before unemployment rate rounds out to a cool 21 million unemployed souls. 

We don't have guaranteed healthcare minimums for any of them anymore. We used to have Obamacare for all on the books, almost nailed down. That was a compromise to keep the insurance companies in the mix instead of going to single payer systems solutions. 

It's hard to muster sympathy for fools who brought us here, supporting the disemboweling of functional government safety net systems, the CDC workers in China, our State Department, and anything else that Republicans could find to give tax breaks to corporations and the most wealthy plutocrats so that they in turn could refuse to build out the infrastructure for this new century, and instead go on hunting trips to kill endangered species, or buy newer and bigger yachts, and buyback stock in their companies and pay more dividends that get taxed at lower rates than the middle class. 

The workers spend money they make to improve the economy. Trump and his henchmen, the sycophant Republicans have destroyed it."
2020-04-09 22:53:35,"I do not wish that anyone suffer, but I am truly amazed at the lack of American independence and values shown in these stories.
My depression impacted parents taught me that everyone had an obligation to have savings equal to 6 months gross income - no ifs, or buts. 
Multiple birthdays and holidays were bereft of presents because we fell short of that requirement. We did without many of the things that the other kids in the neighborhood had - bikes, new clothes, games, toys, etc. Christmas was sure to bring underwear and maybe a pair of jeans or a ""new"" coat - from Goodwill.
I put myself through college on a partial scholarship and a full-time job in a rolling mill. When I graduated, my savings exceeded my annual starting salary - so much for the value of a college education.  Every paycheck had 20% of gross taken out for savings.  When my wife went to work, I bought a used Postal Service Jeep to get myself to and from work – 45 miles each day.
I got laid off three times in my career, I never took unemployment or borrowed my way to survive the gaps. I took any job I could find, no matter how menial. 
This disease and the misery it has brought is horrific. I have true feelings for those who suffer.
But it's time that Americans became the sensible people my post-depression parents were - stand on your own two feet because no one else is going to be there to hold you up.

No business will go on loosing money because of sudden revenue loss without quickly adjusting their costs down. 

What the government have offer is loans to these businesses. These loans will need to be repaid. 

Who is going to load on debt to keep employees on the payroll to not work ? 

Only if you subscribe to the idea of a quick rebound in 3 months you would do that. Only Trump believe this will be the case. For most businesses in entertainment dining, travel it will not be the case. Even elective medical care won't see a rapid come back as people try to rebuild they savings or keep on struggling to earn a living. 

Grants to substitute for 50% of the employee paycheck may have worked with another 20% from the employer to keep people on payroll. That's far better than trying to do this through employment benefit that are not in a form of a loan.  This is also what a number of country have done."

Are you really trying to cheerlead this economy into some death-roll to the bottom. Describing an economy as coming within the ambit of a “Black Hole”?! Speaking specifically for my job site where the entire 50 employees including myself were laid off on Tuesday 31st because of virus-infection/ social distancing concerns, I know of 10 of the total employees who had phoned in on the prior Friday to offer some flimsy excuse that they were “afraid” to come to work owing to the current health-scare. 
This Flu-Pandemic is primarily ( means mostly) a threat to people who were in God’s waiting-room to begin with.

Here's the thing. Out economy depends on people spending money. If the average savings rate was much higher there would instantly be a recession. Think about it. Everyone saving 5 percent more of their income means everyone spending 5 percent less of it, which means businesses have less income and have to start laying people off, which leads to people tightening up their budgets more leading to more layoffs etc. Too much saving is actually a problem for China.
Also, we live in a society that constantly encourages consumption.  The purpose of ads is to drive consumption and we are exposed to them all day every day. Adults living with roommates or young people living with their parents are considered losers. Society is set up in a way that requires that everyone have expensive degrees and a car.

When people have money to spend, businesses sell their products and thrive, people have jobs, and everyone benefits. Here is a natural experiment, one that nobody would ever willingly design: take away consumer spending and look what happens. It's a disaster.

It's time for the federal government to go all out in supporting unemployment benefits, continuing wages for people on furlough, subsidizing health care coverage, helping small businesses (not just large corporations) so they don't go out of business — all the things that will help ordinary people continue to put money into the economy.

But watch. The Republicans will resist ""giving people money"" because... what? It's ""socialism""? People don't deserve it? People should have to work hard to succeed? A CEO who earns 300 times their average employee must be working 300 times harder? Small firms are on their own, but a really really big business deserves to get bailed out?

What we are going through is the best evidence that our economy has been stifled over the past 30 years of flat income for 90% of US citizens. It's time to put money into the hands of people who will spend it and not to those who will use it to speculate in the stock market."

As it stands now, the federal government is literally paying businesses to stay closed and workers to stay home.  Once the coronavirus business shutdown ends the US economy will rebound in a way greater than ever before.  

In the meantime, the devastating & far-reaching consequences of a prolonged economic shutdown could indeed be worse than the original coronavirus problem in the first place.  With that said, the complex decision to either prolong or end the economic shutdown is not a dichotomy but rather, a continuum.   

So, instead of being dismissive one way or the other, we must be willing to have that honest and open conversation."

Frederic Lordon.

At that time I posted his essay in the NYT. Nobody even made any comment.

He was also saying that since the health care stock options were the highest revenue in Wall ST, the huge amount of money from the insurance premiums paid by American citizens had been diverted into speculation to invest in other fields but not in health care. Thus depriving the hospitals from investment and furnishings.

Now it is the past. The guy was probably seen as an ugly marxist at that time. Barely one month ago."

2020-04-10 02:22:44,"This was all avoidable.  

The CDC has had a plan of recommendations for how to deal with minor epidemics like this (and this is a minor epidemic, no more serious than the 1957 Asian flu or the 1968 Hong Kong flu).  The plan was a detail scheme of recommendations on how to address epidemics, based on the seriousness of the epidemic, using a Pandemic Severity Index carefully drawn up by the government.  That plan was updated as recently as 2017.  Nothing in that plan even suggested closing down the economy.  That wasn't even discussed in the plan, even for far more severe pandemics than this one.  Presumably experts who were thinking rationally, and not hysterically, understood what the consequences of that action would be.

Here is a link to the plan, since no single journalist has even discussed it:

2020-04-10 01:00:22,"Why are so many supposedly “well-informed” readers so eager to compare the current economic crisis to the financial meltdown of 2008? 

The 2008 meltdown was the inevitable result of years of financial recklessness – banks engaging in hedge fund trading with profitable derivatives which in turn prompted them to demand more mortgages. The banks then opted for interest-only loans that were more affordable to subprime borrowers. Cheap mortgages led consumers to rush for houses causing a disequilibrium in the market because more people invested in real estate. All that originated here in the USA. 

Our current economic shutdown was not caused by any of the above; it was caused by a health crisis that originated in China, and that has since wreaked havoc throughout the entire globe.  Before this happened, the US economy was running smoothly on all cylinders and on the upswing. 

Let’s put things into perspective and not compare apples to oranges.  After the current coronavirus business shutdown end the US economy will rebound in a way greater than ever before.  But as the President recently opined, the devastating & far-reaching consequences of a prolonged economic shutdown could indeed be worse than the original coronavirus problem in the first place.  The enormously difficult decision is not a dichotomy but rather, a continuum.    

We must be willing to have that honest and open conversation."

The incompetent Trump administration overwrites medical professionals and opens the country next month. They will do it chaotically and badly with no central planning. If one wanted to open the country, it would have to be done with precision and planning, with the help of wide-spread testing for remaining cases and those who have had the virus without symptoms. Trump and the remaining bottom feeders in the WH are incapable of planning and opposed to testing because it reveals how badly they have managed the crisis. They will open the country, to quote the president, in a big bang. There will be an explosion of new cases and a second wave more devastating and widespread than the first. That second wave will destroy the economy and America will spend the next decade trying to get back on her feet while other countries that handled this better will recover much faster. There you have it. I really hope I'm wrong but I also know that if you elect a president like Trump, bad things will happen."

I worked in commission sales for a major retailer and made a decent living until they closed their stores nationally. Understandably, they did not know when they would be able to reopen and offered to pay us for three weeks in an effort to offer us some pay - not our commission rate but an hourly rate - for me about $12 an hour. 
I qualified for the $1200 payment- no sign of that. My bank has not begun to receive payments. 
I applied for unemployment- my application is still in process - or so it says when I am able to get on the website (between 10pm and 6am) as directed in order to get through. 
My partner is still working about 70 hours a week and interacting with the public but his salary has been cut in half and he will no longer receive the bonus that he worked so hard to earn.

Trump and Republicans first 'Mission Accomplished' cut taxes on the wealthy (including himself!). Wow, what a twisted world. And the average working-class Republican wants to talk about guns and abortion and immigration, but not wealth distribution. That's a curse on America.

We've talked about the crisis in health care for years (terrible example of a 'modern' nation, we are) but have avoided the housing crisis. Now we see millions of good and noble Americans unable to pay the high rent they face. And, we should note, that many multinationals, hedge funds, private equity funds are buying up houses and apartments to rent to us. This is a growing area for 'investment'. Republicans, mainly, want to privatize health care, housing, prisons, war, etc. You can make money on anything.

Excuse me but it's the GOVERNMENT shutting businesses in every state. I find myself wishing for the good old days when the government would shut itself down and leave the rest of the country open. It seems that congress has finally realized that no one really noticed the former and the latter gives them more power than they ever dreamed of. They have essentially taken the country hostage. No aid will flow until they get what they want. The $2.2 trillion aid package was just the start. Get ready for phase 3, 4... Even governors like mine are in on the scam, ratcheting up what are likely unconstitutional restrictions on ""non-essential"" workers. It turns out that unlike the government, there are no non-essential private workers, evidenced by horrendous impact their decrees have wrought on our economy. Not satisfied with destroying livelihoods, Governor Murphy showed us whose really boss by closing all state and county parks.

This, in and of itself, is totally unprecedented.  But the current shutdown was not caused by financial recklessness or an underlying weakness in the economy; it was caused by a diabolically novel virus that originated in China and that has since wreaked havoc throughout the entire globe.  In fact, before the medical scourge suddenly took hold, the US economy was running smoothly on all cylinders and on the upswing.  

As the President recently opined, the devastating & far-reaching effects of a prolonged economic shutdown can indeed be far worse than the original coronavirus problem in the first place.    

A number of Asian countries have already begun to reopen businesses across the board…with people going back to work while at the same time exercising hygienic due diligence by wearing masks, gloves and by avoiding physical contact in crowded public places.  There’s no reason why we can’t do the same here in the USA.  

The decision to either prolong the economic shutdown or end it is not a simple dichotomy but rather, a complex continuum.   So, instead of being dismissive one way or the other, we must be willing to have that honest and open discussion…totally devoid of partisan political implications."

We also met Dr. Radhakrishnan, the Vice President (soon to be President) of the Republic, and  John Kenneth Galbraith, John F. Kennedy's  ambassador to India.  The Delhi air was never so clean again.  On a visit, in 1999, after a few days, because of a nose-bleed and a respiratory infection, I went to a doctor.  He blamed it on Delhi's air quality and said the quickest cure would be to leave the country for a cleaner environment.  In the last 21 years, no doubt air quality has grown much worse.  And the pity is that the political system can't get its act together because of all the interest groups to find a more lasting solution.

  What is amazing to me is not the clean air from the shutdown but Indians are obeying the orders to stay indoors, that is unbelievable! 
    Not only Delhi but even Los Angeles has some of the cleanest air of any major city. Los Angeles has notoriously polluted air.

How people can continue to not see the negative correlation of population  growth and environmental quality and in reality of almost any measure you want to use, is as baffling as the phenomenon of climate change deniers.

Like frogs in water gently brought to a boiling point, citizenry in places like India and China do not realize how bad the air quality is, and also, how much cleaner it COULD be. Hopefully the present situation will jolt people into some action. 

I also think we should ""pause"" the global economy a few weeks every year in December. No travel allowed. This will staunch the flow of viruses and give the environment a chance to heal."

We can achieve something similar with a renewable energy economy."

The tactic of the ""primitive"" tribes of Africa, South America, and the South Pacific (most likely Europe too) who sacrificed souls at the feet of kings to bring peace unto the kingdom. 

Once ridiculed, Westerners have now fully embraced this ritual of population control - or as they like to call it ""drawdown"". 

Back in October 2019, a woman at a townhall meeting in...wait for it...Corona, Queens told Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez that ""We have too many people, we have to start eating the babies, the Green New Deal is not enough.""

We now have our clean skies at the cost of 82,000 and counting lives with no complaints. Now that you have found your solution, what would you like for dessert babies or grandfather? They are both good for the planet and the digestive tract."

2020-04-08 21:47:43,"A Shakta might say that Mother Kali is offering us a lesson. And posing a question: how much of the poisonous froth of modern life is truly necessary for survival?  Obviously, people are still eating. Food is still being grown, harvested and moved to market. And yet the skies are now clear.

The world has entered a cycle of economic production for production's own sake. It's not because we need all this activity to live. We need the constant frenzy to sustain the current global economic system, and for no other reason. According to its rules, you need a job in the money economy in order to become entitled to adequate food and shelter, and the economy itself requires steady growth to remain stable. But these rules are not immutable natural laws.

The fact that a job may be useless or even harmful is totally irrelevant. Money is money. The global economy does not distinguish between farmers who grow food, manufacturers who build bombs, and media moguls who generate pornography. The term ""gross national product"" is descriptive on multiple levels.

The requirement of the global economy for steady growth is purely an internal systemic mandate. It has no necessary connection to the wellbeing of humanity. In deference to systemic demands, for awhile the planet could absorb the poisons generated by the excess production of non-essential goods and services. That period of benign tolerance has now ended. 

Can we adjust graciously to the new reality? Mother wants to know."

2020-04-08 21:46:14,"The biggest reason for remote work and using mass transport instead of individual cars  when needed, should be the outstanding impact it can have in stopping climate change and mitigating pollution.

The irony that it takes the fear of a killer pandemic to get people to realize the value of the planet is unmistakable.

I see this all the time in the Times. Yet you would never ever lower-case mars, pluto, jupiter, etc.. This is so embedded that when I was typing this, the Times' Auto-Correct fought me to capitalize those likely lifeless planets -- yet did not with ""earth"".

2020-04-08 23:44:11,"There is a catch to these clean skies: global dimming. 

After 9/11, with the grounding of airplanes for three days, the skies over rural Pennsylvania turned an intense cerulean blue where there had been the gray remains of contrails. 

Scientists took the opportunity to refine their measurements of global dimming: the amount of sunlight blocked by air pollution from reaching the surface. They figured global warming was reduced by about 1 to 1.5 degrees by global dimming. Remove global dimming, and global warming will soon become worse. Some have even suggested artificially increasing global dimming to offset increasing CO2 and methane. PBS had a documentary soon after on the topic.

But the sort of air pollution in India and China is too high a price in damaged health by COPD to pay. 

I lived in India near the Dhauladhar range, at an elevation of about 5,500 feet. The air was always clear (except during the monsoon). Delhi's air was only bearable for a few days at a time, and those were average days. 

However, I saw worse air pollution in Korea, where planes couldn't take off from Incheon because of the heavy, gray blanket, and China, where the air was so gray you could barely see buildings and it looked like after sunset during the daytime. 

We now have 7.8 billion people on our planet, including 1.44 billion in China and 1.38 billion in India. 

In 1955, there were 2.8 billion people, including 600 million in China, and 400 million in India, and 171,685,336 in America."

Even this year's Republic Day parade on January 26 in New Delhi - air force planes doing fly by were difficult to spot - even on tv.

Every year, I managed to escape summer months out of India to other places - hot temperatures and the pollution were simply unbearable.

My friends are sending me photos from Mumbai which are also quite similar.

I used to have an air purifier in my apartment even though I lived very close to the Arabian sea.  Every time, I returned to Mumbai in the past 5 years - I knew I had arrived there because I would start coughing.

It was simply awful to breathe.

This is an extraordinary short event that most folks in India will look back with fondness.

Enjoy till it lasts because it may never come back again.

Hopefully, they will also remember that vehicles do not run faster if they keep honking."

The lockdowns and restricted economic activity has show the way that results can be achieved. People have the right to clean air and blue skies. Why not ? Collective measures to change how we produce our electricity, how we run our industrial parks and how we run our automobiles has been the need of the hour for a very long time.

2020-04-09 02:01:28,"With India’s reported cases doubling around every four days and now topping 4,000, many people are bracing for a long lockdown.

-------

Was reminded of an old Chess parable. A poor Brahmin chooses to be rewarded with a grain of rice on the first square that double each day for as many squares on the Chess board. Simple calculation shows that on 17th day from now 250 million Indians are likely to be infected, unless the measures are made even more stringent, and that also shall not be enough.

The only real option is what Chinese have done. Test everyone and cordon off the infection suspects. Categorize the suspects into varying stages and corresponding treatment options. 

The investment required for this is humongous, but India has the wherewithal to make it happen, provided right policies and measures are put in place. Hopefully BJP government shall be equal to the task. 

One thing is certain, slackening the lock down  without proper testing framework is not an option."
2020-04-09 01:54:52,"I can attest to the smoky taste of the air. When your plane lands at IGI and switches to local air, you smell it immediately. 

Indian air quality is a complicated problem involving corruption and poverty. Rightly or wrongly, the gov has banked on a ""rising tides lift all boats"" strategy to grow the economy as much as possible as fast as possible to lift 300 million people out of poverty. That means leeway on emissions for job growth. There is progress with a switch to LPG for commercial vehicles but many industries pollute. 

Key to Delhi air quality is the seasonal rice burn north of Delhi. Farmers in Punjab have subsidies on the production and sale of rice, which they grow to the extreme. The cheapest way to clear fields is burning, so the northwest is smoky in fall/winter. This problem falls squarely at the feet of politicians pandering for votes.  

Lastly, India is a developing country and the poor improvise with wood and cow dung for cooking and heating. The gov has heavily advertised to get LPG to them but adoption is ongoing. People also burn trash of all sorts. 

To fix all of this would mean ending poverty and corruption, simple answers to complex problems. Pedantic responses like banning cars are insulting. Infrastructure investment, education, reforms to corruption, and support/pressure from foreign governments are needed to help India improve its filthy air."
2020-04-09 02:07:59,"The biggest problem is government pushing urbanization wanting to make smart cities.  India has been a land of villages, the government need to move towards smart villages with clusters of specific industries.

In a crisis while we die I guess you think we’re supposed to expand our horizons to help the poor. Well we don’t. When there was going to be a nuclear attack I know wealthy people who built bunkers so they could be saved. But saved for what. I have no idea.

Perhaps now, these poor countries may learn to develop themselves. Be strong. Be democratic. And protect yourself. And stop asking for foreign aid.

If America kept all of its foreign aid right back here in America. We would have clean water. Clean rivers. Futuristic highways. Fast railroads. And people we claim art poor would have a job even if it ware planting trees because they are poor. I have personally seen people walking around. Yet collecting $800 because they are disabled. In Germany when soldiers lost their arms or legs they were out there fighting. But here we pay them because they have a small limp.  But who are regular Americans fighting in the wars, to save these people who can walk but get a disability. I think not .  Perhaps we need to revitalize and stop being the big nation we claim to be.

2020-04-09 12:45:07,"Gee, there's a surprise.

Ultimately, rich countries don't care about poor countries unless the rich countries are feeling very flush and have no major disasters staring them in the face.  In this pandemic, every rich country has its hands full worrying about how to protect its own people -- obtaining ventilators, PPEs, hospital beds, providing medical help, and providing jobs and unemployment benefits -- and they have very little bandwidth (if any) to concern themselves with the people living in poor African, Asian, and South American areas, i.e., people who live in very close quarters where the novel coronavirus can spread easily.  We should expect to see the worst of the worst handling of the pandemic in those areas, and the worst of the worst devastation.  Once the virus really takes hold in Africa, India, Southeast Asia, South America and Central America, it is going to be Armageddon."

2020-04-09 12:34:45,"This is where American (and European) hypocrisy is at its most distilled. Every day we hear that we have to lock down to save lives and that every life matters. Every day we hear that we are all in this together. But of course every life does not matter, nor are we all in this together, otherwise resources would be shared fairly and rationally. Health care has long been a great source of inequality, and that has not changed with this coronavirus. The wealthier your household, your city, your state, your country, the better health care you will receive, the less likely you will be to get sick and the less likely you will be to die. This discrimination is most striking in the United States, because its wealth and resources should allow for a fairer distribution of health resources, but is hardly absent in other wildly unequal societies, such as Brazil.

Perhaps, paraphrasing Trump, that's just the way it is, but then please spare us the sanctimony of an Andrew Cuomo lecture about no life being disposable, even as New York hoards staff and equipment it may or may not need. Someone poor is dying somewhere right now who may not have died if they had a tenth of the resources New York has at this moment. So yes, it appears that some lives are disposable."

What is to blame for this is the greed of corporations to make ever larger profits, then used to remunerate corporate executives and to buy up smaller competitors. 

Until this system changes, situations like this one will continue to happen. The bad news is: the system will not change all by itself. We have to change it. This can be done only by actively demonstrating dissent with the system. 

Safeguarding our mortgages and car loans and savings earmarked for the education of our children and grandchildren and has put us in the pockets of global capitalism."

2020-04-09 13:40:42,Is Federal government shortchanging the hospitals and the states ? It seems to be spending a lot on procuring medial supplies but it is also giving away those supplies to other county when its own needs cant be met at home.
2020-04-09 13:40:45,"Not that it makes it right, but it's called human nature. People have no problem giving to others and patting themselves on the back for being so generous when they are nice and safe. The problem now is that everyone in the world is after the same supplies so now people aren't so charitable. Our governments are telling us not to hoard, yet they are. Obviously, it's every person for themselves."
2020-04-09 13:17:36,"Sadly, this is how things have been for most of human history.

If a situation becomes life or death for the whole world, the wealthy make sure they are taken care of while the rest.....

Ironically, goods wanted by wealthy nations are now not necessarily made in those nations.   If nations where the goods in demand simply shut down exports things could get 'interesting' - likely violent.  For now profit seems to take precedence over all else,

In a sense we have reverted to colonialism where the wealthy colonial powers take what they want from the weaker and poorer.

One can't help but wonder what the world would be like if the trillions spent on the military - and on proxy wars that never should have been fought - had been spent more constructively."

Having admittedly ""precarious"" health care systems in countries whose leaders scuffle around in private jets to golf resorts in different corners of the world has always been an unsustainable model--one whose unsustainability only becomes more apparent during a pandemic."
2020-04-09 14:13:33,"If this 'greedy' outbidding of poor nations from needed protective materials, to avoid the spread of coronavirus, is 'solidarity', then lying Trump ought to be called a paragon of virtue, an obvious insult to reason and decency. If we are all in this together, then we must act as one and help each other. We  do recognize who our  friends are when difficult times arise. But this require the will and courage to act by integrating the world's needs, far from a persistently exclusive Trumpian braggadoccio of ""America First"". Orwell said it well, as those wealthier countries give themselves kudos for a job well done: 'we are all equal...but some are more equal than others'."

Testing is also overrated since there is no known cure. Treat patients based on already well known symptoms. Don't wait for test confirmations that will not come.

Furthermore first world hospitals themselves may actually make the problem worse. Sealed buildings with recirculated air could also recirculate the viruses themselves. Open the doors and windows instead. Let the fresh air and the sun in.

Same with the vaunted ventilator, sticking a tube down a patient's throat to pump air in may just invigorate the viruses even more. 

These may be real reasons this disease is hitting rich countries hardest right now.  So just do what you can to help the patients where you can."
2020-04-09 14:27:49,"Yes,  rich countries are rich because they have a stronger economic system than poor countries.  As has been shown repeatedly in countries like Argentina, Chile, Venezuela, countries prosper when they adopt conservative economic policies and they founder otherwise."

But who is supposed to do that when developed countries are not even able to get enough supplies for their own needs. It is a global shortage. One can move around or share the shortage, but until either supply increases or the need diminishes, the shortage will remain."
2020-04-09 14:48:11,And the severe outbreaks are in Europe and the US. And I might add the populations of the US and Europe are relatively older compared to that of Africa or S America due to lower birthrates. So if anything the most fair solution is for the lion's share of the supplies to be going to the US and EU. To each according to their need. To each according to their ability.

Everyone knows what the problem is. The problem is that the rich do not occupy the same planet as the rest of us. Even the rich people know that’s a problem. The ones who won’t publicly admit it are just lying, and the ones who do admit it aren’t giving up their fortunes to help bring balance to the world.

In previous times of massive social upheaval, we used to have leaders that the downtrodden could look upon for guidance, flawed as they were. 

I feel like... I almost feel like we are in an alternate timeline. Like we are in a timeline that we were never supposed to be in. Like a time traveler from the future went back to 2014 and smushed an ant or something and now the world is in an entirely different place than it was supposed to be.

Where is the modern version of MLK? Where is the modern version of Daisy Bates? Where is the modern version of John Brown? Where is our moment’s Nelson Mandela? I feel like in this moment, we were supposed to have a national figure to build a coalition, a new Global Labor movement... but the podium is empty because now we are in a tangent, and can’t get out.

I wouldn't put it past Trump and Jared to be hoarding PPE, tests kits, and ventilators for use by the wealthy, to send to Red states once they get hit hard, and to resell to other countries. Call me paranoid. I don't care. This administration has never displayed an ounce of shame, integrity, conscience, or moral fiber to make me believe they would never do something like this. How many millions of Americans and small businesses are still waiting on their money from the two trillion stimulus bill? How many medical staff are having to procure their own viral protective equipment? And tests. What happened to those millions and millions of testing kits we were told by Pence (weeks ago) would be available to us?"
2020-04-09 14:29:17,"Hmm.   Seems a lot like the disparity here.  Blacks, Hispanics, Navajo Indians are dying in record number and the country responds by ensuring Trump properties are taken care of, and Jared becomes the new prince, and he gets a federal hand out while throwing his tenants to the wolves.  The principal concern of the SC Justices: 'we will sit all isolated and safe, but voters in WI can go, stand in line, and catch the disease.'  Republicans want to make sure, regardless of this crisis, that no democrat can vote.  Cruise lines get hand outs; the front line workers are told: go all rugged individual.

Imagine if the USA got 650 million test kits last week and also ordered 5x its population in masks (about 1.6 billion)!!? This seemed like a hoarding attempt by a rich nation to me.

Bottom line? Developing countries should prioritize where they channel their resources and minimize corruption in their healthcare industry(ies).e.g,universal healthcare efforts in Kenya by the current government."

And having dollars compete for resources works fine for many goods and services, but it's downright immoral for things like this. We now see the cost of that shortsightedness in stark terms.

It's too late for this round, but from now on, government are going to have to start paying companies simply to maintain a certain level of readiness to ramp up, with periodic surprise stress tests. And we need to rebuild international cooperation.

However, what most of us still don't seem to realize is that allowing coronavirus to spread unchecked among the poor, the vulnerable and the most marginalized, whether in our own country or around this planet, may have unimaginable and lethal consequences for all of us.

By our many choices - especially in our voting over the past 40 years - we have created a country in which countless millions of our fellow citizens lack the health insurance required to  seek medical help at the first sign of serious illness.

We have shaped a country in which tens of millions fear they will be deported if they show up at a doctor's office or emergency room.

We have let our country devolve into a nation already wracked by extreme poverty even before this catastrophe
arrived. Twenty-five percent of our children are poor enough to have to depend on their schools for enough food to survive.

The mile-long lines for food banks show just how financially insecure many of our sister and brothers are.

Meanwhile the man in the White House --who seems more mentally unstable each day-- has commandeered half a trillion dollars and is fighting to be able to pass it out to large corporations without oversight.

These steps alone will help greatly.

Lack of testing kits seems less important to me, esp since the majority of folks the world ever, never got tested.  Yet, we all got the message that it was our own behaviors that can make the biggest, positive impact."
2020-04-09 16:15:42,"For the next pandemic, maybe we should have a system that certain percentage of vital supplies are taxed and diverted to UN for distribution to poor countries. If CA buys 1 million masks, then 100,000 of them are automatically shipped to UN, for example. Maybe it is easy for me to say since I'm not a front line worker. But most people would understand the need to share, I hope."

Readers blame capitalism.  But capitalism acted on the advice of economists who praised outsourcing of ""labor intensive"" products

When American workers complained to the advocate in chief, Paul Krugman, after yet another pro outsourcing piece, he responded

"" I guess I should have expected that this comment  would generate letters along the lines of, “Well, if you lose your comfortable position as an American professor  you can always find another job–as long as you are 12 years old and willing to work for 40 cents an hour.”

Such moral outrage is common among the opponents of globalization–of the transfer of technology and capital from high-wage to low-wage countries and the resulting growth of labor-intensive Third World exports. ""

2020-04-09 16:42:34,"I was in the emergency operations center in Monrovia, Liberia, towards the end of the Ebola crisis. We were having a meeting with a UNICEF representative along with several Liberian technicians about an information system in use to communicate with frontline health workers. It had been over a month without a new case and we were beginning to breathe easier. 

Then someone came in to tell us that at least one new case had been diagnosed that morning. (It turned out to be five.) I remember looking from face to face and seeing a mix of fear and disappointment. I felt it myself. Despite all the precautions—public temperature taking, washing hands in bleached water before entering buildings, and social distancing—the virus had broken through. 

It dawned on me that no one is safe until everyone is safe. That is even more true today because COVID-19 is much more easily spread than Ebola. Barricading ourselves at home and practicing social distancing will help, but we all share the risks. We need to figure out how to share the burdens."

Written in 1997 by Jared Diamond, (PhD; professor of  history &  anthopology) at UCLA, the book describes in rich detail how whole cultures - ancient races - disappeared - when they contacted and died from disease spread by European colonists who came to their lands.  These were diseases like COVID-19, but  which the Europeans were now immune, having antibodies from their ancestors that had survived previous epidemics.

The coronavirus pandemic we are witnessing today is comparable to the Plague or to the ""Black Death""or the ""Spanish Influenza"" - to the entire panoply of viruses that have gone before.  Of course these viruses cull the weakest and the poorest disproportionately.  Such evolutionary biology makes human survivors stronger long term.  It is our Darwinian history."

The Governor of the state here is very proactive and messaging all the time to quarantine. All beaches are closed. Liquor sales are no more - anywhere including shops.  The barrios here are literally people living upon people. Many times whole entire families with grandparents , uncles and aunts, grandkids etc in a very small house. These barrios are ripe for the spread of the virus. It will climb. Average pay per month for a general worker is between $600 and $800 per month. That's $20 dollars a day often. Cloth masks are being produced by people in the barrios. Mexicans are very keen on cleanliness. Unfortunately, like many (private plane of Texan kids partying on the beach here in March - almost all infected) the importance of the message is slow to circulate and accepted.  Just common cleanliness won't cut it. We are working together on it. Just gave a talk today to some people and ask to spread this info to their neighbors. Fingers crossed. Billions of dollars have been poured into this area for tourism. The hospitals , some good, are few and limited in services. Pray we find a vaccine.

2020-04-09 17:05:57,"This is why the development of a country's economy must take priority over labor rights, the environment, religious rights, democracy, and so on. It's because if your country is poor and/or lacks technology, you are at the mercy of stronger and/or wealthier countries, natural disasters, and pandemics. 

You lack the money to buy what you need to buy, as others are willing to outspend you in the global market. Lacking technology you cannot build, invent, or discover what the state or your citizens need. Being weak you are unable to prevent your country from being bullied nor pressure others to do what you want. 

Personally I think climate change is real and we are contributing, and I fear for the environment but mankind's survival and the survival of your nation / community comes first. The People's Republic of China has made many mistakes over the decades, but one of the things they did right was their laser like focus on developing their economy and acquiring / developing technology, by means both fair and foul. Now they are in a vastly better position that the nation-states of Africa, Latin America, and some parts of Asia."

Poverty, corruption, terrorism, kidnappings, murder  still goes on.  People walking miles for American  jobs that pay pennies. 

No one should be surprised about  testing kits anywhere,  we have incompetent leadership who never prepared for anything and we have minorities dying in America  because of health conditions that we have known about for generations.

In January, I remember a CVS pharmacist angry that all her thermometers and masks were acquired and sent abroad, and she forsees that health care workers will need it too. 

In recent days, we also discovered that 3M and some US manufacturers sold to their distributors oversees and those in turn price gouged at websites around the world, despite a dire need at home here.

Most masks and many vital chemical ingredients and medical equipment are made in China as well. Yet the government has seriously limit exports of their N95 masks, creating a problem of access.

This is also a chance for China to help what it started, now that their situation has calmed down.

From Europe to South America they are complaining about the Trump administration’s “Wild West” tactics in outbidding, paying far above the market price for medical-grade masks from No. 1 producer China. 
On occasion the US wins contracts through higher bids, or blocks shipments to buyers who have already signed deals for those vital medical supplies.   
The US has  been paying above market price for much of the gear purchased overseas.
One official, who requested anonymity to discuss the matter, said the US would not stop buying “until we have way too much” and could still be searching out protective gear abroad through August.

How can countries (such as the U.S.) be expected to export medical supplies if we are unsure what the future holds?

we hear politicians and pundits weighing lives against profit, like chefs debating the right pinch of death to make an ever rising loaf of lucre ... and meanwhile -- aren't the poor ever with us? 

poverty is an incredibly deep structural fact of human organization. every society is organized that way; wring the neck of a nation, and that spine of power becomes visible and active. 

but there's nothing deeper in this article. are drug cartels profiteering? do USA and EU have leverage because they buy in mass? if poor nations remain poor, decade after decade, is there anything to be done about it?

Perhaps the writer could provide a prioritized list of those  US and European citizens she is willing to have die because we gave away medical supplies to countries lest fortunate. Perhaps journalists would be at the top of that list. Success does not require an apology. An important motivation for societal success is to be able to provide adequate protection from hostile military and microbes for one's citizens. (The Walled City). In a perfect world there would be a surplus of medicine, food, clothing, shelter, education etc. There has never been a perfect world.

2020-04-09 21:30:23,"A lot of comments remind me of one of my favorite American anecdotes. Shortly after we arrived in the US, I broke my wrist. It was misdiagnosed in Urgent Care, and I was sent to my physician than an orthopedist (yes, it took me five days to get a cast).  At the orthopedist, I chatted with an elderly lady. When I told her that was my third doctor’s visit, she told me it would cost me. I thanked her and explained I was French so I hadn’t thought about that. When I explained how the French system planned for - at least in theory - treating all patients without leading them to bankruptcy, her reaction wasn’t that it was wonderful. Instead she asked: ‘Even the lazy ones?’. It still puzzles me to see how many -usually white- Americans think they are entitled to more than their fair share of the world because of what they obviously feel is their superior. As is the case in many other places, there is of course a lot of generosity,often by people who actually cannot afford to share, but to whom poverty has taught that cooperation is what keeps us human."

First, it is the job of every government to protect the health and welfare of their citizens first.  So there is nothing wrong about them paying whatever they have to pay to protect their people.  Period.

Second, the article fails to talk about the billions of dollars that corrupt leaders of these countries have stolen.  The money to bid was there, but these evil ones decided that stealing their countries blind was more important than protecting their citizens.

Third, India has developed a robust pharmaceutical manufacturing industry.  It is time for poorer countries to stop waiting for handouts and start producing the things that they need to protect their people.

Fourth, China has shown that it is possible for a country to move from poor to developed . . . if it is willing to make hard choices, including turning its back on foreign charity.

Finally, Rwanda is showing the world how quickly a country can get it is act together if it focuses on sustainable economic development.  Rwanda wants to become the Singapore of Africa, and is now not only the safest country in Africa, it is now the 9th safest country in the world.  Yes, Rwanda."

Australia spends more on its own health care than all of sub-Saharan Africa.  The USA also wastes well over one trillion dollars on health care per year.  

In effect, effective American health care reform and cost control would free up billions of dollars for ourselves and for assistance in low income countries making the world a safer and healthier place.  

American failures in this pandemic are going to result in an economic crisis costing trillions of dollars.  The ultimate losers will again be the low income countries.  

Our medical schools and schools of public health have all developed global health programs.  These programs consist of seemingly supportive but not nation building projects.  If these programs were to address OUR problems and were to reform our system and were to pay attention to our own warnings of future pandemics, then we would have addressed this current crisis earlier and at a much lesser harm to ourselves to ourselves and to our economy.  In turn, we would have been better able to assist low income countries.

I then tried to get the most economical heat sensing thermometer from Amazon and guess it was not available for sale until May and the more expensive ones were charging shipping. 

What's the use of of calling America a rich country overspending Latin America and Africa if people are hoarding and there is price gouging and there is a scarcity of essential Coronavirus supplies which have become like gold. We need to make supplies like masks, sanitizers and thermometers in the USA henceforth so that countries like China do not jerk US around as they are probably doing to Latin America and Africa.

Blue states have used their economic power to bid against each other and the other states to secure the equipment needed to protect health care workers.

Her cooking made my sister and I think of our Mother's penchant for never throwing food away, even thought she could have cooked from scratch.  Whatever dish she made from dribs and drabs was called Musgo, because it was made from whatever was leftover and ""must go.""

Instead of puff pieces like this - including the I heart Cuomo editorial by Dowd, I wish the Times would do some responsible reporting on Cuomo. The Times could start by following up on his Berger Commission and this recent interview:

Educating is hard.  Exposing food industry for it's garbage policies is hard.  Validating trailer park food choices is much easier, but a shameful money making choice.

that spirit that says:  Can-Do!  All-American!  You-can-do-it!

That was the attitude of the America I grew up in.  We need that attitude today more than ever.

As an adult, I've had the good fortune to travel a bit of the world and sample the magic of top-rated chefs.
But the taste of Michelin-star dishes will never touch what Sandra Lee brought to my soul.

Thank you, Ms. Lee.
I wish you all the best as you go forward."
2020-04-10 21:40:15,"Let’s be honest—her semi-homemade food was gross and unappealing, reminiscent of the classically awful Kraft recipes of my childhood in which mini marshmallows, Jello and Philadelphia-brand cream cheese figured in everything. And it’s not elitist to say so: at about the same time, Rachel Ray was preparing straightforward, accessible dishes on Food Network that didn’t require fancy ingredients or hours of preparation. What’s more, Sandra Lee’s fussy  ‘tablescapes’ and colorful, girly cocktails  seemed calculated to drive half the viewing audience — that is, the guys — to change the channel. All the more reason an interview I saw Donny Deutsch do with her years ago was such a revelation: here was a smart, savvy, even sexy businesswoman, whose television persona was unfathomably the exact opposite."
2020-04-10 22:11:47,"I grew up in the Land of Make-Do. I can relate to making a magical dinner from a single pita bread. I’ve been cooking good meals since 1982, when I had a weekend job making cheesesteaks & hoagies at my mom’s boyfriend’s deli in South Philly. I was a wee chef at a 3 star restaurant in the east village while I studied at NYU. I’ve cooked for Lou Reed & Vaclav Havel. I’ve cooked for fancy Hollywood families. I designed & produced fantastic birthday parties on 5th Avenue & I had the BEST tasting dinner parties in 90’s Brooklyn. Most people I know are not like me when it comes to food & cooking. When it comes to the cooking of food, most folks are pretty hemmed in, emotionally. They desperately want to get it right the first time. I bypassed all this because as soon as I could read, I pushed a chair up to the stove & started making crepes. I was playing. Deep Play.
Cooking can be a very scary prospect; the idea of not doing something well is stultifying. Even, humiliating. 
I loved reading about this woman because she sounds a little weird, warm, funny and complicated in the way that people so wonderfully are. Is she an artist? Nah. An epicurean? Nope! Is she lacking confidence? Not by a mile. Would I love to go to her house in the summer for a backyard bbq, beers, eat burgers on potato rolls & crunch coleslaw? You betcha! Sounds like fun."
2020-04-11 02:14:35,"I'm sorry, but who is this person again, and why are we supposed to listen to her for advice on how to run our lives at a time like this.

The Times regularly presents us with the accumulated wisdom of a number of professionals to advise us on these issues,. Is that not enough."

2020-04-11 03:13:12,There's a big disparity between her description of her relationship with Gov. Cuomo (and I must say that I too am suffering from Covid Stockholm Syndrome and have become a fan of his) and the generic quote sent to you by his spokespeople. She seems sweet and it made me a little sad.
2020-04-11 01:29:25,Basically she made unhealthy food look attractive.  Not a good thing.
2020-04-11 11:09:53,"I, too, grew up in a home where money was tight and my mother worked long hours - in the 60’s.  In those days, it was Swanson TV Dinners - the Salisbury Steak with a lemon muffin was my favorite, and we had those ready when my mom got home."
2020-04-10 23:40:58,"I seem to remember photo's in our media of Ms. Lee in a wedding dress.

2020-04-11 03:53:23,"Hope she doesn't feed the bird the food she cooks and advocates for—all of it is so bad for you.  Otherwise the bird will die young. Parrots need foods that are sodium & sugar free, and unprocessed. Whole grains, fresh veggies, fruits,  nuts, minerals, organic bird pellets, and good fats are optimal. Do that and add lots and lots of crazy playtime, and no life for the human parent-or whatever you call yourself. All of that guarantees that your beloved feathered child will outlive you and require a trust fund to ensure a happy life for them after you have departed this planet."

2020-04-10 16:49:13,"I didn't know much about her or that she came from such humble roots. While I am a big advocate of eating healthy and am critical of the food industry and the junk they produce, many of those criticizing Ms. Lee and her cooking, the fact she uses commercial food in them, the kinds of ingredients she uses, have never had to worry about a meal, about how to stretch a budget, and also how to produce food quickly and easily because they simply don't have the time to produce from raw ingredients. My family is different, we are fortunate to have the kind of income where we can buy organic produce and products that aren't loaded with HFC and chemicals, and we have the time to prepare healthy meals from scratch.  To be honest, I cringe when I see the recipes produced by chefs, they reflect a reality most people don't have. 

One negative comment about this, when they said Phoenix was her pet, they committed a major faux pas. Anyone who  has ever had a companion bird knows they own us and also knows they are often the dominant partner in the relationship:)"
2020-04-10 16:57:55,Sandra Lee is terrific. Watched her for years on Food Network. Also watched the documentary chronicling her breast cancer surgery. She is one brave human being to allow cameras to document that difficult journey. Glad to hear she is feeling well and cancer-free!
2020-04-10 17:53:22,"Sandra Lee, what a class act.  I am lucky, I can buy and eat what I want, but I also remember the days of ""commodity cheese"" and pancakes for dinner.  Think about the folks who live in food deserts right here in the US who are feeling pretty good when they can grab that boxed meal from the local convenience store which is the only store in walking distance.  Shame on the shamers.  Thank you Sandra Lee for your courage to speak out, for giving us hope (5 year survivor here) and for being, and not in the least, always kind."
2020-04-10 20:30:43,"You have to grow up poor in order to understand the appeal of Sandra Lee. You don't go out looking for fiddlehead ferns and rice vinegar, you go to find Gulden's mustard and cheddar cheese. People who grow up with enormous amounts of money and who are comfortable throwing perfectly good food away are spoiled. Kids who turn their noses up and get away with it have no clue and that is because their own parents do the same thing.

I, too, am a ""make it into something"" person. I often make a new meal from leftovers. Chi-Talian, Indi-mexican, veggie melange, from leftovers from the restaurants meals we didn't finish or from things I have in the pantry. I add spices or condiments and sometimes rice or pasta. Really, creativity. Being vegetarian helps, but my husband who is a carnivore, likes what I fix and isn't too arrogant to turn it down just because there is no meat.

Those of us old enough (boomers) to have been raised by parents who grew up in the great first depression were taught never to waste anything. My mother saved buttons and zippers from old clothes, she re-worked the clothes we had, my father could fix anything mechanical (before computers) and between the two of them they managed nicely on my dad's just-above-minimum-wage job. 

Good for her that she is succeeding and that she and the Governor are on friendly terms. Says a lot. Thanks for the article."
2020-04-10 18:49:26,"Great article! 

This reminds me of how my sister fed her two kids: “We have two choices for dinner tonight: take it...or leave it.”"
2020-04-10 21:55:13,"I have tried to avoid processed/packaged food since I am a 5.5 year breast cancer survivor... but it is expensive and not always a doable thing.  I may not agree with her recipes, but I also grew up eating cream of mushroom soup and Bisquik. She is a survivor like me and I wish her good health.  That surgery is horrible."
2020-04-10 23:09:07,"Sandra's show was upbeat and interesting, different sets every year, attention to detail while integrating what's in your cupboard with fresh produce, meat, etc.  She wasn't so much gourmet as teaching how to adapt and how to be creative with what you have. How to plan a menu and budget for it.  It's too bad they aren't on anymore, she was a wonderful teacher and family cook.  We could use her style and experience now."

2020-04-11 11:54:06,"I've always know Ms. Lee's backstory and found her to be inspiring.

One can cook from the pantry and using other store items that are healthier than many of her choices. 

Let's be honest. Yes, cooking with items from the pantry is something many Americans do and I do regularly; however, her recipes from her original show were unnecessarily high in sodium and fat."
2020-04-11 12:05:32,"My favorite foods: 1- canned spinach at room temperature; 2- leftover lasagna hot or cold; 3- leftover spaghetti, with or without meat hot or cold; 4- canned corn, creamed or niblets; 5- peanut butter straight from the jar. I could survive happily for months.

I’ve been trying to buy as much organic and non-GMO food as possible. OK. I’m retired and comfortable with a family of four, including my wife,  who is furloughed but still being paid for a part-time job. We are cooking and eating more, but we’re eating well."
2020-04-11 14:41:08,"I enjoyed Sandra Lee. Some of her meals were good, some not. But she showed you that you could make something out of nothing. Maybe her ingredients were not the healthiest but she showed you that you can have a nice meal, a good presentation and enjoy your food. Please, people, stop food shaming. I grew up in a single parent household and we had no money. If Sandra could show people that lost their jobs and income, that they could have some dignity at mealtimes, then she is worth her weight in gold."
2020-04-11 16:09:43,"I would not recommend eating processed foods right now. There are plenty of healthier ways to feed yourself that are cheap and easy. Simple plant-based meals are pantry friendly, affordable and much healthier. Revolve meals around affordable staples like rice, beans, oats, pasta, potatoes &  whatever fresh or frozen produce is available to you."

Sandra Lee's upscaling of those convenience foods was an attempt to make something special of the everyday and inexpensive food from the cupboard.

2020-04-11 18:48:03,"while this is fantastic, there are plenty of ways to make your food last. the issue is that most Americans are not equipped with basic skills when it comes to the kitchen. this 'disposal' mentality of eating processed and not fresh is what's killing most people's immune systems and so on and so forth. processed foods are not the answer now.  those little 'chicks' while cute are horrible. one does not have to be a kitchen 'snob' to cook well, healthy AND in a simple way."

To those who practice food snobbery and have a difficult time (and some jealousy?) with those who don’t ‘go all natural’, I’ll remind them of this which I've remembered for nearly 50 years:

‘There are no junk foods, there are only junk diets.’"
2020-04-12 17:24:47,"There are some comments here that people should still eat fresh rather than processed foods right now.
That's the ideal but for many people it just isn't possible. I cook from scratch, eat organic as much as I can and have a well stocked pantry and freezer, but I'm working long hours at home so am using small local stores for fresh produce at the moment because I just don't have the time to queue at supermarkets in the evening. 
I am less fussy now about organic and fancy stuff than I was - it's a case of buy what's available or go without. 
There will be many essential workers who will go to the store after a long day and won't find fresh food to cook for their families. Ms Lee sounds like the right TV cook for these times."
2020-04-12 17:26:19,"I really liked watching and learning from Sandra Lee and appreciated her take on food and ingredients. My sister and I grew up poor with a single mom and understand the importance of making the best of what you can afford. Glad for folks who have more money and thus more choices but for many (most?) Americans, we don't have the option.
This reality is hard to bear sometimes especially after reading the article yesterday on how American farmers are discarding, dumping and plowing under good food because they can't get it to market."
2020-04-12 18:25:11,"I don't recall Ms Lee's shows being aired on Food Network UK but I would really like to see them. 

I love watching food shows but these days I watch Masterchef, Barefoot Contessa (my favourite) and the like through a different lens. They seem quite indulgent; it seems like a long time ago that I've selected a recipe and gone out to buy all the ingredients I need for it. Now I'm looking at using what I have or can find, and avoiding wasting anything. 

An unpretentious TV cook that understands the  limitations of availability, budgets and time is the kind of comfort viewing we need right now."

My mother canned most of our vegetables from our garden but we never had a lot of meat so my mom would stretch the meals. Sunday nights were either grilled cheese and tomato soup or creamed peas on toast. That’s great if you only buy organic or fresh vegetables but I’m stuck at home and can’t go out much due to my asthma. Using some prepared food is a necessity especially frozen veggies. Organic is way more expensive where I live. It sounds like most of the readers are not in tune with struggling Americans especially these days. if you only go out once every week or two, it’s hard to buy all fresh items.

But what should be most concerning to everyone who uses Zoom (myself included) is what’s going on with the software and processes that make up their backend operation.  I cannot say for sure, but given the design flaws that have been found in the visible part of their product I can only wonder about the choices they’ve made to protect the parts we don’t see.  

Many companies and schools have, virtually, placed their offices and classrooms inside Zoom’s environment.  If some knuckleheads can figure out how to Zoombomb an AA meeting imagine what a skilled, nation-state attacker could be doing."

2020-04-09 14:22:47,"Seems obvious that Zoom moved too fast and broke too much stuff.  They admit that they never thought about security and privacy implications for general consumer use.  These flaws existed before C19, so by extension they also had never thought much about those implications for their original business user base.

 Kind of ironic that their big hire to improve security and privacy is a former Facebook executive, especially given that all along they have been shoveling user data to Facebook and seemed to be quite oblivious about it.  I read elsewhere that part of their code was built using facebook’s SDK so how can they be surprised?  Ugh."
2020-04-09 15:11:34,If there are lots of configuration choices related to security wouldn't the obvious first pass solution be to have them all default to the most secure choice? Novices would be as secure as possible and with experience and investigation they could selectively open things up. Documentation would be key.
2020-04-09 15:15:06,"I suspect a touch of anti-Chinese sentiment in the attacks on Zoom. Zoom was designed for ease of use, and yes, there are security compromises that were made. This applies not just to Zoom, but also many of the consumer apps. Facebook, good ol' Google, Microsoft Windows. Zoom is cleaning it up and we will see if they succeed.

What is undeniable is that Zoom's entire user experience is vastly superior to the alternatives. As someone who has to endure Hangouts Meet, Skype, Webex, MS Teams, Teamlink, and countless other web conferencing apps, none of them come close to the relative ease of use of Zoom. Try handling anything with more than a couple of participants in any of these apps. Invariably, you encounter video/audio drops. Screen sharing is a serious pain. 

All these other competitors are now taking a good hard look at why they had the first mover advantage but yet lost to Zoom in popularity. They see that they have an inferior product in terms of user experience. So if the likes of Google announces that they are banning Zoom in their workplace, you can be sure there is much more than simple security concerns - most of which are fixable with the right Zoom settings."
2020-04-09 15:22:09,"Zoom has a notorious history of ignoring very serious security deficiencies. Last year, security researchers discovered a design flaw which would allow hackers fairly easy access to all of a Zoom user’s Macintosh computer.  Your email, financial records, the whole thing.  Why? Because Zoom installed a web server on your Mac which had root level control. It could be triggered by websites you visited to download and install software invisibly.  Uninstalling Zoom left this web server installed and running.  

Zoom repeatedly refused to acknowledge this defect, and only released a fix after repeated industry and press demands. And there have been other, serious episodes.  

To be clear, this company absolutely doesn’t care a bit about end user security.  They want to get their product working and shipping.  

Computer security is not a Band-Aid. Think about their approach: Make product, ship product, issue security fixes only if they’re discovered, reported, and you’re pressured by your customers to do something.  But computer security must be architected into a product’s design and through all of the processes of making it. This is well-known in computer engineering.  Zoom doesn’t get it, and their statement that they’ll correct things in 90 days is proof. It took Microsoft and Apple years to make their systems secure, and they still need to maintain a very high state of vigilance and issue continuous patches to maintain security.  Zoom is nowhere close to such a level."

I'm sure someone thought about that, but those words often go unheard in the corporate setting.

Now we use the waiting room, remove chat, screen sharing, renaming; have co-hosts watching for disruptive users, as Ikeaboy has described below. 

This has worked so far. Make it harder and the trolls will go elsewhere. 

I've set up other large-scale video-conferencing systems in business environments. Could not have moved our meetings to virtual with those systems without much more complicated account creation, on-boarding, continued support, $. 

So now we some new service positions that serve as co-hosts and watch the waiting room and people we don't know yet in the meeting. 

Just thankful we're in this era instead of pre-broadband pre-easy video conferencing.

A lot of the security issues are solved by using waiting rooms or passwords. If you need encryption for confidential information maybe you shouldn't be using Zoom. There is probably a more expensive and paid service you could purchase or host yourself.

Ok I was a tortured leave voter, but this is one of a number of reasons why the UK exit cannot be dismissed as political and economic madness. The consensus legitimacy of national states is clearly being demonstrated here above & beyond the notional EU. People look to their parliaments not the EU to tackle this. Bad times lie ahead especially for the poorer southern countries."

The pandemic could provide an opportunity to construct a narrowly targeted program that could help mitigate the economic effects of the pandemic and possibly provide a template for future joint euro-wide financing efforts. Since the world is now living ""outside the box"", it is now time to start thinking outside the box."

Answer is not really  simple, even with very effective antibody and  screening tests.

Majority of population hasn't  affected from the virus. 

Let me give a an example which you may or not find your self in that situation.

When you are driving  in winter , in very cold  , icy conditions, you came a mountain climb and down hill.  now down hill comes, you cautiously proceed abut car start to slid, you managed to stop , return is not possible. 

Road condition is  black ice, and lots of sharp turns and steep down hill. 

Noe you need to move forward without  chaining,  when you ease the brake  car moves but  you immediately feel  slipping,  if you go down hill without too much attention, 100% sure you will end up in the ditch. Cautious proceeding  will be extremely time consuming, tiring.  no help you can get from out side. 


That is  the situation is waiting us to ease on restrictions, we will feel immediately the slip , numbers ticking  up.

When the roads and bridges are falling apart, it shouldn’t be your decision alone to make.  When there’s a plague, it shouldn’t be your decision alone to make.  In all these situations except your own home, everyone who is impacted needs to see their needs being met in the results of the decision.  It’s called Direct-Results Decision Making.  

When hospitals can lose track of patients and bodies, it’s because the healthcare system is broken.  One of the easiest concepts in business and life is inventory.

In Wuhan and most of China, there is no sign of a second wave because they have developed herd immunity as the result of the initial wave’s widespread impact far beyond what was reported to the world. The lockdown came too late to affect the course of the first wave. It did give the government complete control over information flow and people’s actions.

Other nations should keep that in mind as they assess what they see in China. It will not be a good example on lifting lockdowns in places where lockdowns have spared much of the population."

Dr Ferrari is frustrated because he lacks the executive authority to impose a research program on the scientists of individual EU member states. But, of course, that's because the EU - contrary to right wing propaganda - works mainly on consensus rather than compulsion.

Where the EU has tried to gather real, supra-national powers - in the case of tax evasion and anti-corruption laws, for example - the pushback from vested interests, invoking the spectres of tyranny, fascism and lost sovereignty, is both extraordinary and highly organised.

In most cases, where the EU decision making appears 'weak', that's because certain member states (the UK particularly) prefer it that way."

Xi Jinping is the only one that we know as an introvert, and is in sharp contrast to Trump, an extrovert I believe.   China is an introvert country.  She doesn't boast its glory to outside world, only to her own people to draw support to the government.  

Wuhan's success is no accident.  It drew ten thousands and more volunteers & 42,000 plus medical doctors and nurses from all over the country under the government's order.  China replaced its top leaders of Hubei province and Wuhan city when they failed.  It had a tough and strict lockdown counting and checking on everyone inside the city boundary.  No fish is too small to slip through the net without being caught. Volunteers deliver the daily necessities and medications to local resident.  It is like a jail except they still can order food and other stuff online and can talk to anyone in the country via WeChat or cells.  But this approach won't work in a democratic society unless the majority citizen recognize that it is the only way to have a short pan and quick recovery.

Or we have to find our own solution to solve the pandemic virus.  Or to develop a vaccine quick enough to protect all of us. Or to find a hybrid approach to defeat the Covid virus.  It tests the ability of our government."

Death and taxes are inevitable. Not everyone gets to live past 100 and if anyone knew inevitability of death, it is my father, a Kentucky Colonel who at 100 years and 7 months is still fighting to survive in the COVID-19 era. He is around since the end of world war I because he led an exemplary lifestyle avoiding death and 100s of ways one could die. He served his country with distinction, honesty and hard work. He was a non smoker, a very moderate drinker of red wine. He had a balanced diet with optimal protein intake in plant forms, eggs, fish, poultry etc. 

We are beginning to know why COVID-19 is killing more males than females, more people above 60 than before, more people with underlying conditions than before, more smokers than non smokers and avoiding death after COVID-19 infections is more complex than just being infected. No one lives forever and it is not the responsibility of any government to ensure that every one lives as long as they desire especially not if they have been causing self inflicted harm by ignoring advances of the science of disease prevention."

There are only two possibilities here. One is that the CCP has taken its lie to another level, or that China must have a secret weapon to fight the virus.
We are talking about a country which healthcare system is not as developed as that of Italy or France. Yet somehow, with a population of 1.4 billion people has only had 82000 cases and 3300 deaths.

I'm not one of those who believe in conspiracy theories, but excuse me if I do when it comes to China. And this is a country that some want to give control of their 5G to because it's cheaper.

It is clear that official Trump policy is to eschew anything resembling a cogent, effective and efficient plan for widespread testing and instead create an Escher print out the ad nauseam pharma stock pumps for companies producing questionable tests, deferrals to state and local officials on literally everything and appalling self-adulation that are all presented in a daily, ratings-obsessed rant.  

Obfuscation of the depth and breadth of this pandemic by avoiding a policy on testing and data collection should be this president's downfall.

Thousands and thousands of unnecessary deaths and infections, with many thousands more to come due to Trump’s incompetence. From Trump dithering and lying and congratulating himself to Republican governors refusing to shutdown their states to the failure of rural leaders and individuals to take the crisis seriously, there’s a lot to be  angry and upset about. 

Republicans, conservatives, evangelicals are dangerous. Their ignorance has been and will continue to be deadly for weeks if not months to come. They had plenty of warning and chose to ignore the recommendations to not go out and to practice social distancing. (That lunatic Bundy should be arrested and thrown in jail for creating a public disturbance, at the minimum.)

The Republican minority that dominates political life here is unfit to lead. But they are good at manipulating their base and the machinery of democracy through gerrymandering and voter suppression, so they stay in power in spite of their unfitness to govern.

Republicans have created quite a mess in this country. They may have “succeeded” so well that it may be impossible for Democrats to save the country yet again. We will see in November. I’m not optimistic. If Trump’s ratings have gone UP in spite of the overwhelming evidence of his absolute and total incompetence, it’s not clear how Democrats can beat him."

Very sad that the Governors refuse to protect their citizens from themselves. Even sadder that innocent, fervent beliefs and traditions may lead so many to their untimely eternal repose. Prayer requires no building or companionship. Grace is the experience of inner gratitude for breath and life with the assumption of personal responsibility for both for all.

The “herd immunity” approach has only succeeded in making Bojo  one of the herd. He models himself on Churchill but, in actuality, he resembles Nero.

It is time to celebrate Mother Natures ability to reclaim cleaner skies and clearer waters.  It is also time to photograph, measure and immortalize the affects staying in place has had on climate change, global warming and environmental pollution."

In fact, most of the Asia countries took the similar methods and they all control the virus. In US, unfortunately, our government took the opposite methods and promote the spreading."

From Drs. and independent Chinese journalists who ‘suddenly disappear’, the writings were on the on the walls. Couldn’t an independent (and objective) organization see these signs?

They've lied the whole time, and the West needs to do something about it as the deaths mount up, caused in part by the Chinese Government's mendacity.

2020-04-08 21:36:22,"Yesterday was a beautiful day in Boston.  I'm nearly 85 and I live in Boston now, not Cambridge.  I was scheduled for an immunoglobulin infusion to boost my immune system (I have bronchiectasis, asthma, and chronic lymphocytic leukemia).  Fearful of the public buses and trains, I decided to walk the two miles up and back between my apartment and the Cancer Center (it took me 1-3/4 hours each way, walking slowly but steadily).  

There were many people in the streets on this lovely day, both old and young, but about 8 out of 10 weren't wearing masks.  Some walked two or three abreast, coming up behind me or approaching me from the front, and forcing me against building walls on the narrow sidewalks of Charles Street in the Back Bay section of Boston, because they refused to walk single-file when passing other people.  

Keeping social distancing was impossible.  And several couples of male and female, some arm-in-arm,  proclaimed the most blatant attitudes of gender cliches: the women masked, the men maskless.  The weather was heartwarming, the sights on the street quite heart-freezing."

Some public health experts are trying, but they are having to kowtow to the Toddler-in-Chief and cannot tell the truth without fear of consequence.

A possible glimmer of the notion that some curve somewhere might be beginning to flatten does not mean that this pandemic is about to end.  An anti-malarial drug is not a game changer.  If it were, we would not have 12K deaths and counting in this country. 

We are in for a very, very long slog.  Not until there is an effective and widely distributed vaccine will we be able to resume even some small semblance of ""normal.""

It's time our leaders leveled with us and began planning for what we can SAFELY and REASONABLY do in the interim 18-24 months to keep as many people as possible alive, housed, and fed.

Diseases  from deadly smallpox, right through to once debilitating, but still incredibly nasty and common childhood diseases such as mumps and measles. Perhaps because we no longer have regular occurrences of diseases that have no vaccine for, we have become complacent and forgotten how interconnected society is.

Trump is spot on about the WHO.  The WHO does serve the interests of China in preference to its supposed purpose of protecting world health.

In late January, the WHO refused to declare this virus a world health emergency.  In its explanation at the time, the WHO admitted that it refused because it did not want to harm China's economic interests.

Then the WHO concocted the name it gave to this virus as COVID-19.  It did so in order to protect the economic and political interests of China by not drawing attention to the fact that the virus originated in China.  The virus' origination in China was not a fluke, it was not a random occurrence.  It originated in China because China embraces a cruel and inhumane practice of capturing wild animals, keeping them live in inhumane circumstances, bringing them live into the midst of the population, then butchering and eating them.  The appropriate name for the virus is ""China virus"".

It is hypocritical for the WHO to criticize, as it has, many nations for their inadequate response to this virus.  When the WHO did so recently, it was a classic instance of the pot calling the kettle ""black"".  

The WHO is a thoroughly corrupt organization which purposely refuses to perform its duty to protect world health."

Jan 19:

“Not enough is known to draw definitive conclusions about how it is transmitted, the clinical features of the disease, the extent to which it has spread, or its source, which remains unknown.”

It wasn't until the WHO visited Wuhan that it announced to the world that testing ""suggested"" human-to-human transmission.  Until that point, the world believed the virus was tied to a single market and not a risk to anyone who hadn't visited it.

It was the Lie of the Century, and the WHO failed to expose it."

There seem to have been only very limited teams of doctors or epidemiologists to fly to early hotspots, no baseline standards for lockdowns or for contact tracing, and, in my view most significant, an overly business-friendly and lax attitude to air travel, specifically recommending on the 29 February that:

""WHO continues to advise against the application of travel or trade restrictions to countries experiencing COVID-19 outbreaks.""

I believe that this virus outbreak could have been contained and the shortcomings of the WHO played a large part in our failure to contain it."

Here is the evidence: 
The cluster of pneumonia cases with an unknown cause in Wuhan was reported to the Chinese Center for Disease Control and to the WHO on December 31.
The first genome of the (2019-nCoV was identified by the Chinese National Institute of Viral Disease Control and Prevention. On Jan 12 the whole genome sequences for the 2019-nCoV was shared with WHO and the GISAID platform, the international depository.

It is the White House that blew the opportunity to control the virus. It had January, February and most of March to listen to its own science and the experience of China to prevent and limit transmission to the United States population and military personnel. That is criminal and prosecutable.

The WHO needs to fully explain why the US shutting off flights from China was wrong at that time, and what information made it no longer wrong, and when did the new information come. If the WHO was wrong, they need to issue an apology. Time to get specific with the details rationale reasoning timing. The US has 15% of the world GDP and pays 15% of the WHO funding, but Trump is not afraid to penalize unreasonable criticism.

If anything, the WHO is a political tool of China. I listen to GISAID and the CDC but the WHO has lost relevance as a global organization in my view.

Knee jerk opposition reflex reactions here in the US were damaging during the Obama administration and are just as damaging, given the clear and present threat perhaps  even more damaging now.  It was perfectly obvious that curtailing international travel from hotspots was sensible, prudent public health policy even if it came from the mouth of Trump.

This is also bad. For once, Trump has a great point on this, and the WHO needs to go to bat for ALL THE COUNTRIES still at or before their peak.

In my opinion, the WHO under the leadership of Dr.Tedros has become a tool of the Chinese propaganda machine
These are the facts:
1. WHO’ endorsed the Chinese claim in mid-January that there was no evidence of human-to-human transmission of the virus.
2.  WHO consistently supported Beijing’s handling of the crisis and criticism of other nations for imposing travel restrictions to and from China.
3. WHO lulled the world into complacence by delaying the decision on calling it a global emergency.

   During the SARS epidemic of 2002 under different leadership, WHO was at the front and centre of pressing China to come clean on the unfolding pandemic. In 2003, it had issued the organisation’s first travel advisory ever on travel to and from the epicentre of the pandemic in southern China. As the SARS crisis escalated, Beijing’s traditional arguments about the centrality of state sovereignty yielded place to a new policy of working with the WHO and taking proactive steps to reassure neighbours in South East Asia.
   Some attribute the turnaround in the relationship between Beijing and WHO to China’s growing financial contributions. Others suggest that China’s political support was crucial in the election of Tedros in 2017."

2020-04-08 11:26:20,"Of all days, I think yesterday was the worst.

As the Coronavirus claimed the most lives so far, we realize that Trump's corruption, derangement? megalomania? is not just of the self-interest, money-scamming sort, which was already the worst, but of the truly life-threatening sort. To think: on a day when he maliciously threatens the funding of the very organization, W.H.O., that tried mightily to warn him about the dangers of the coming pandemic, he simultaneously took no responsibility for his Republican party's stunning insistence that the voters of Wisconsin expose themselves to a life-threatening disease, just so it can cling to power.

And, as my own small business faces the possibility of bankruptcy -- despite a 13-year history of never missing a single payment -- because we can't access the promised relief funds and lenders have frozen our lines of credit, he praised the virtues of a man, Modly, who nearly single handedly caused an outright rebellion in the Navy that my father served, while he literally sent me ten emails asking for money because ""the Fake News Media refuses to report the truth about all of President Trump's efforts to Keep America Safe."" And, no, I have never ever sent him a single penny -- just letters politely asking him to resign.

I don't know what's wrong with Trump -- clearly something --but it's irrelevant now because this inhuman monster needs to be removed from office immediately. I don't think we can take many more days like this."
2020-04-08 16:16:26,"China and Wuhan are leading the way back to a functioning economy. China has the ability to ascertain who is ill versus healthy and those results are on their cell phones allowing police to check as often as necessary. If corona does not create an unmanageable second wave, they will continue to expand the economy. They can ""modulate"" disease because of their advanced testing capability and software that exists on people's phone.

The US is woefully behind Wuhan. Given Trump's dismemberment of an agency designed to prepare, followed by denial that robbed us of precious time, to political squabbling over distribution of resources, America suffers the worst possible president at the worst possible time.

Nevertheless, knowledge is getting out there thru universities and pharma. Although Trump impedes progress thru his obedient but unqualified agency heads, his willful promotion of drugs that are unproven, and his failure to use powers achieved during Korea. America will get thru this."

Everyone, keep your eyes on the ball - Trump is throwing out all the red herrings he can net to distract from his ignorance. He is a stupid man and has been trying to hide his stupidity all his life.  He wants to make us all stupid so he will achieve his greatest ambition - being head of the class. To do that, he has to destroy all that is good. WHO is not perfect but it is a heck of a lot better than the ignorance governing in the WH. Smart people fix things that have purpose but are broken.

2020-04-10 13:05:36,"I do wish we could get more thorough information on deaths.  A sentence in this update stated that Co-vid 19 preys on human desire for contact, as do most naturally occuring viruses and such, because we are indeed walking germ and bacteria conglomerates, but from the very little information we are getting about deaths, I keep hearing that 85-90% of deaths have one OR MORE underlying causes (including most of the 80+ who have died), yet 80% of people catching the virus have mild or asympotmatic responses. So, it's not that the virus is necessarily ""preying"" on human tendancy to herd, but rather that so many of us are already sick and inflammed from lifestyle choices and social conditions we humans have built around ourselves, the very conditions that not only sicken us, but sicken the planet.

Viruses and other pathogens are natural occurences.  We are acting like this is an alien from outer space, an alien hunter that is invisibly preying on humans, like in the Pedator movies, and so we must locked down, close all human business, but it is in fact just nature doing its thing.  Once again, humans are trying to control and demonize nature, many parts of which are actually gaining health just now.

I wonder if there will be a way to figure out the actual death toll later?  

A Times reader commented on some other article that he's noticed climbing obituary numbers in his home area.

Trump's political strategy is to falsely repeat over and over that the coronavirus is unprecedented, that no one saw it coming, and that his response has been ""great."" But when asked by reporters about it, he said, ""I don't take any responsibility at all."" 

Spreading lies and misinformation is Trump's way of handling the crisis. Early in the crisis, Trump said that the coronavirus would simply disappear. ""It's going to disappear. One day it's like a miracle—it will disappear."" Trump ignored dire warnings in January from U.S. intelligence agencies about the coronavirus pandemic, downplaying the threat and blocking necessary preparations. He also stonewalled inquiries from Congress starting in early February. 

Trump failed to mobilize the government and private sector to establish testing early on to contain the spread of the virus. Dr. Fauci calls the lack of early testing ""a failing"" of the U.S. response resulting in a massive lockdown. Then, he promoted a risky antimalarial drug as a treatment, with no evidence.

He needs to be removed now, as well as the totally incompetent political staff that he has hired.  (was this deliberate, or are they the only people who will work for him?)  Waiting for next January means continued disaster both for the response in lives and the economy.

On the stimulus just passed, it is now obvious that it was late.  16 million Americans have already lost their jobs and at least that many more who are contract workers or are working in the gig economy without benefits. i.e. unemployment insurance.  Employers who are offered forgivable loans for keeping staff have already laid them off and know that they can receive unemployment benefits, so why rehire them, accept for family and friends and a key employee or two.

My NY-based mother succumbed quickly after testing positive, and I got a quick condolence and the body has to be picked up in four hours.

The lockdowns today provide for neither liberty nor freedom.

Most Americans, myself certainly included, would gladly sacrifice much to prevent unnecessary deaths, including our personal freedom. But, there has to be a light at the end of the tunnel.  Indefinite extensions of Draconian restrictions not only risk freedom, they may well substantially increase the number of deaths over the long run, as the global economy collapses, and basics such as food, medicine, and the components of our infrastructure become unavailable. It is important to remember that lockdowns probably do not allow herd immunity to develop.

When I read that Michigan is now banning most home to home visitation I wonder if we are going too far.

I don't have any easy answers, there are none. Many don't like the phrase ""a cure worse than the disease"" but it is something to consider.  ""Flattening the curve"" to save our medical systems from getting overwhelmed is worthwhile, but draconian sanctions that continue indefinitely may not be, and truly may do more harm than good.

Again, there are no facile answers, only very consequential tradeoffs.  But we need to consider the big picture.

The 1,125 people who died at home or the streets of New York City within the first five days of April is about 20 percent of all confirmed Covid-19 deaths in the city. What percentage of these people were uninsured who were afraid that showing up at the hospital would financially ruin their family? How would they have impacted New York’s ICU capacity if they showed up at the city’s hospitals? The lack of early testing and prompt results, the lack of clarity over covering the cost of treatment, and relying on ordinary people to monitor their vitals and disease progression in their homes is leadings to preventable deaths. We must do better: ALL costs of COVID-19 treatment must be covered and people who are positive for COVID-19 should be under supervised care whether through low-level care hospital beds or apps that allow routine check-in. We’re still behind other countries in best practices."

But Trump's zero-sum approach to everything is going cause more harm than good in the end.  The competition Trump has set up among States competing for the same supplies, and then helicoptering in and grabbing them is immensely counter-productive.  Although, I imagine it could be extremely profitable for those invested in those companies providing the products (hint, hint).

Trump's earlier gambit to buy that vaccine startup in Germany certainly set a dangerous zero-sum tone.

Instead of the Feds working cooperatively with companies and States for supplies to be moved around transparently with a defined process, it remains secretive.  Gov. Cuomo has even suggested that as his surge diminishes, that excess gear be transported to other needy areas.  If there are excess ventilators at some point, why can't they be provided to other areas of the world that have little?  

Why are we being so stingy on the medical supply budget, but don't think twice about $2T slush fund with no oversight?

The end result, I fear, is that Trump will so offend allies, that at some point the US will miss out or be on the trailing end of some break-through therapy or device because he has set the ground rule as everyone for themselves.  Trump should learn from history that our Marshall Plan and behavior following WWII set up an extremely prosperous period for the US. Imagine the world if Trump were POTUS, then?"

This is a straight up bold-faced lie!
The trump administration over the last three years has been drastically cutting budgets and gutting public health agencies, eliminating preparedness teams, and abruptly  dismissing expertise.  There was a pandemic czar and an office full of experts that worked at the highest levels of our federal government that had been running trainings and exercises, ensuring national pandemic stockpiles, modeling possible outcomes, organizing collective response and communication channels, and planning for the execution of these plans. But the nation was left totally vulnerable and in a place of ""catch up"" instead of ""prevention"" as trump deliberately dismantled all the important measures Obama had taken to protect the nation from the 2014 Ebola infection crisis and guard against other possible infection situations in the future.

Sheltering in place as much as possible reduces interactions between people and thus reduces infections, while having a significant negative impact on the economy. Death is permanent, the reduced economic impact hurts badly, but is temporary. Finally, the sooner we reopen the economy, the more infections and the more deaths.

I am not trying to be a smart you-know-what but that way any one can be a forecaster, you miss by a mile, you immediately find an explanation and plough on.

Plus, those forecasts ('forecasts') are without exception excessively grim.  That is understandable - if it comes to pass (god forbid) then it is going to be 'told you', if it turns way off, then it can only be good news.  They always massively err on the side of caution but here it is not as simple as just sit and home and carry on.

And if the choice is between a continued total shutdown or a gradual reopening starting with those who have antibodies, who would *not* be in support of the latter?

Heck, if we could test the kids, then at least some of the kids could return to schools and daycares. 

I suspect we'll find there are a lot more people with antibodies than the data suggests, given how many people are asymptomatic or symptomatic and unable to get tested due to the shortages.

Today there is a threatening headline that 200,000 could die if current measures cease as Trump threatens.  But so far, there is no plan to cease current measures.  Pence who leads the federal response group says we won't open up until it's safe and until there is assurance that we won't have to close down again.  Trump says this and he says that.

Americans will soon have to confront their fears and accept the risk of infection. For most of the workforce, the risk is acceptable. Most cases are mild. Millions are probably asymptomatic. Only about 12 percent of diagnosed cases required hospitalization.  For those aged 20 to 44, the fatality rate for those diagnosed with COVID-19 is 0.1 to 0.2 percent, about the same as flu.

The public health precautions that accompany any easing of shelter in place restrictions need not be draconian but based on our new found knowledge practical:

Some simple suggestions: 1) Grocery stores need hand washing stations outside and hand washing must be monitored. 

2) public places where people need to be near each other should hand out or require masks as a condition for entry. 

3) people who test positive must be required to hang a sign on their door. Nothing embarrassing or humiliating. Simple: i.e. Resident has tested positive for Corona Virus, Use caution..  

4) Parks and beaches need monitors to enforce distancing.

5) Large events should be canceled for the next 12 months to insure time for antivirals and vaccine work to proceed.

Unlike piloting, we don’t demand specific education, training & experience before we hire politicians to manage our country. We don’t require presidents to have served as gov or senator before they assume the most complex job in the world. Therefore, mistakes are inevitable. In contrast, the FAA has the ability to ground any pilot who does not meet the standards. The 25th amendment and the impeachment process have not been used to remove Trump despite his repeated failures and demonstrated incapability to manage this pandemic.

Boeing fired their CEO after he failed to handle the 737 MAX crisis properly. Doctors are relieved of duty when they fail to perform their tasks according to accepted procedures. Even real estate agents are stripped of their license if they fail to serve the public with honesty and accuracy.

By this Sunday, the country will have tallied half a million confirmed cases, twenty thousand deaths, and possibly the highest daily dead count of over 2000.

2.  Have social distancing plans  in place that do not rely on the WHO and included travel restrictions.  These include stores having sneeze guards for cashiers and PPE for staff.
3. Short term economic Bill's are in place and ready to go for things like unemployment, business loans.  That way people can have some certainty about how the bills will get paid.

Ask the homeless who have seen a huge drop off in the number of community groups that helped feed, provide clothing, and help for them.  Ask the rest of the nation as we try to emerge from the isolation only to find ourselves in a deep recession.

Likely up to several hundred million people have been exposed, but because we don't know who, we can't risk opening up, people get infected, and start spreading it again.  We also need to have Covid virus tests available that if it looks like it is coming back again, we can test people for it on a mass scale and isolate people. Waiting for symptoms that match the Covid rather than all those who think they may have it or been exposed to it has helped this spread and led to the shutdown.

Yet these same people cheer Trump, who has basically said it is ridiculous to think of testing millions of people or anyone who wants it, that that is 'stupid' (and he included antibody tests on that).Trump has refused to invoke the defense powers act in getting these tests produced in the hundreds of millions. Instead, he promotes HydroxyQuinon as a miracle cure and orders millions of units of it, when it is pretty apparent at this point it isn't a miracle cure, if it were were would see the death rate drop among those treated with it, and it doesn't look like that at all. A vaccine will likely be available by the fall but likely significant percentage of the population won't have it until 2021"

If we are too quick to lift our shelter-in-place recommendations, we risk COVID-19 being around for longer than estimated and continuing on with its morbidity and mortality rates.  I worry, a lot, about our small business owners and their employees.  But I am sure that many of us are willing and ready to buy our needs through them from communication via their web sites or phone numbers.  Or what is to stop many from doing what our grocery stores are doing, only admitting a certain number at a time, asking for us to wear our masks, and of course standing 6 feet apart at all times.  Yet what is crucial is that we  have to get a better grip on this microscopic enemy and the key is test, testing, testing.  And, I have to say, this imminent antibody test is a real plus in our daily and deadly battle with the coronavirus.  Winning the war is our goal.  One battle is not enough."

The statistics underlying the pandemic at its outset were weak, but there is no doubt whatsoever that social distancing has saved lives, and would have hobbled the disease had testing and face masks been easily available.  

As a result,  we now have a Case Fatality Ratio close to 3.5% --  when in late February we couldn't believe that it might be 2.5%, as that would (allegedly) be 25 times the size of the annual seasonal flu.   The ascendancy of limited government neoliberals in the Democratic Party, and the complete conversion of the GOP into the global oligarch party have combined very effectively to prevent the US government from providing for both the general welfare and  the common defense."

In general the inhibition of viral proteases is a well known pathway for the development of effective antiviral drugs. It follows that there is a high likelihood that this drug will work. If the clinical trials of this drug are not greatly accelerated, and right now, tens of thousands of people may well die needlessly.The government agencies need to get behind this effort, nationalize the process if necessary, a Manhattan project with all hands on deck. With an all out concerted effort, the necessary science could be completed and the drug available by July. This is not time for business as usual.

Locking down the economy for 6 months to save 70,000 of us Boomers is untenable, even in an election year. Better to work on sanitation and elder protection."

The intel community detected issues in Wuhan in late November.

Info was vetted by DoD and NSC in December and it made it into the President's Daily Brief in early January.

In mid-January, while Pelosi et all were holding impeachment afterparties, the adminstration began constituting the Coronavirus Task Force which was enacted on 29 January.

Yes, on 22 January Trump told everyone it would all pass (and it will, by the way) .

But note that on 21 January, Dr. Fauci testified that it was not currently a big threat to the US yet. So his advisors were saying the same thing - before he did - in public.

In private I think they knew better.

CDC was advising travel restrictions for China which Trump put in despite howls from Democrats and the N Y Times among others, crying racism.

The CDC has now admitted that they blew the call on Europe because they were focused on China.

Executive orders only apply to federal government elements and agencies, not citizens. And because they carry the force of law they must be drafted, run by DOJ and White House counsel and then signed.

None of it happens overnight.

State, county, and local health orgainzations are the first line of defense for public health action, not the federaal government. It, runs NIH, CDC, FEMA, and the military, all of which are advisory and backup functions for the primaries.

In Dec, S. Korea immediately leapt into action partnering gov with bio tech companies producing thousands of test kits almost immediately. S. Korea equipped hospitals, tracked the first patient's movements and tested those people. Known as Contact Tracing, they ramped up testing throughout the country. Websites were created to broadcast Hotspot locations where infections were discovered so people could avoid those locations. If people were recently near a Hotspot they could ask for testing which was immediately supplied. 

S. Korea didn't stop there. They implemented rules that allowed the gov to collect massive amounts of data. Their admirable organization and science helped S. Korea avoid lock downs and Singapore, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Germany & the UK immediately adopted the S. Korea methods.

Why did it take 4 months for the US to respond? Why is my hospital still short of test kits, PPE, masks, beds and ventilators? Why are 320 million Americans inferior to the people in S. Korea, Singapore, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Germany and the UK?

When the number of new cases, hospitalizations and deaths have decreased dramatically, then whether or to quarantine should be a personal decision providing you are not putting the most vulnerable at risk￼. 

Knowing what we know now it is clear that the elderly in those with pre-existing conditions must self quarantine until there is either treatment or a vaccine.￼￼,￼￼￼￼￼ Widespread testing for antibody is far more relevant than testing for coronavirus.￼￼ People who want to go back to work but don’t know if it’s safe will benefit by antibody testing.￼ It will also be important to test all healthcare workers especially whose work in nursing homes and assisted living for antibody to the virus￼. The dilemma will always be those that do not test positive for coronavirus nor have antibody. No matter when you end quarantine, April, May, June, July or August￼, these people will always remain vulnerable￼￼.

As of now, the Trump administration has tested less than 1% of the population for COVID-19, yet is clamoring to go back to work by May 1st.  The Trump administration has no coherent plan, has no ethics and is wildly incompetent.  I can't believe anyone would continue to drink their Kool-Aid."

I'm no economist, Mr. President, but I can tell you that it doesn't work that way. 

Think of ""your"" economy as a 200 or 300-car freight train that takes 10 or 15 minutes to cross local streets, holding up traffic. Or (and you won't like this!) think of it as a huge freighter or a destroyer; those vessels cannot ""stop on a dime"" and turn around and change directions just because you want them to. These things take time. Economists are trying to tell you that huge unemployment losses and a cratered GDP are the political price that you're looking at between now and November. You've got to deal with it.

All that said, why not demonstrate some compassion for the American citizen who is scared, frightened, edging away from family and friends--leave alone strangers? The time for battening down the hatches has come and departed. This is happening on your watch. Instead of blaming President Obama or the Chinese or the governors of Democratic states, why not dial it back and accept your Surgeon General's advice, or that of Drs.

Once infected they will become immune at least until a vaccine is created.  That vast majority of Americans would become immune in a very short period of time.

Of course there will be more infections whenever the restrictions are lifted. but ""spike?"" 

The NYT recently ran a story that made the same argument about three non-US economies that had lifted restrictions ""too early:"" South Korea, Japan, and Hong Kong. The author of that article pointed out that critics in all 3 places advised against lifting restrictions, precisely because infections would ""spike."" But I'm willing to bet that any of those 3 countries (or areas, in the case of Hong Kong) would be glad to compare their infection and death rates with  New York.

In short, it's impossible to argue that infections and deaths won't increase when interactions resume -- whenever that happens, early or late. But ""spike"" is almost certainly an exaggeration."

2  We have to get enough (good) PPE for the general public and all essential workers, at a minimum, must have quality PPE (transit and grocery and all who interact with the public daily)

3  Extensive and rapid testing must be available to determine and trace infections

4  Antibody testing must be done to determine the degree of ""herd immunity"" in certain areas and so we can determine areas of higher and lower risk.  Obviously these people can return to work and travel

5  Vulnerable people who have not yet been infected must continue to stay home and there must be financial support for them to do so - people with diabetes, heart disease, G6PD-deficiency, etc

6   Anyone entering a nursing home must be tested

7  Tourist sites and foreign travel must continue to be restricted for anyone not proving to have the antibody 

8  People flying must have N95 masks (perhaps issued prior to people going through security - we would not reopen  economy until a serious decline in cases - so PPE shortage)

9  Employees must be stationed 6' apart in office buildings, wear masks, and breaks must be scheduled so people can sit 6' apart

It seems that congress has finally realized that no one really noticed the former and the latter gives them more power than they ever dreamed of. They have essentially taken the country hostage. No aid will flow until they get what they want. The $2.2 trillion aid package was just the start. Get ready for phase 3, 4...

This nightmare won't end until one of these two was fulfilled. From Europe, the best advice by now that I can give you under my own experience is not play dice with this virus. Keep safe. Best wishes."

Trump wants to resuscitate the economy in time for November, at the risk of killing hundreds of thousands of people. 

Legitimate news organizations should report this story over and over again. Because if people understand that 100s of 1000s will die, they will not buy this freak's snake oil. 

Governors must lead on this point. If DeSantis in Florida lifts restrictions because Trump tells him to, and 10s of 1000s die, that will affect everyone."

Given that WWII occurred over a four-year period, and we've only been in this CV-19 crisis less than four months truly boggles the mind.

It seems that there is nothing he has done (and he has done a lot!) which merits essentially articles or essays that seems to embrace his initiatives, either in tone or actual praise. If he says ""A"" then this paper, uniformly, says ""Z.""  This, of course, was going on way before the virus arrived on our shores.  My suspicion is, though, that most of the country find the President full engaged, stunningly inventive, and completely committed in thought and action to the defeat of our enemy.  Polls, if they are to be believed, seem to strongly suggest this as well.  So I take comfort in knowing that the agenda of this paper exists on an island, and that island is small and shrinking."

Honestly, there are times I would rather die than live in a world of isolation, death and disease. Quality of life is awful right now. Of course, for the safety of others I will maintain my social distancing, I will still wear a mask in public, and remain home as much as possible, but as the reality sets in that we have nowhere to go, and no end in sight, the more torturous life becomes.

We can continue the current approach, which will take 12-18 months to work (until a vaccine) and leave in its wake 30 million or more livelihoods destroyed, 200,000 dead, and a level of civil unrest we have never seen before (which would probably mean riots of the poverty-stricken and spreading the virus anyway). Or we can isolate those most at risk, make some tough choices on care triage, and build immunity amongst the rest (i.e., re-open everything now), leaving in its wake more dead (models say a few hundred thousand to a million), most of whom were already in poor health, though a very small number would be unlucky young and healthy people. Neither option feels good, but I know which one I'd choose. Too many people are pretending we can stay shut down for another month or two and magically we've solved the problem. The virus doesn't go away because we stay home..."

But it is really looking like we overestimated the disease, if the models now say there would only have been 300,000 deaths if there were no mitigation measures at all. The original estimate was 3 million deaths, which warranted the extreme response. 

The next time that this happens, hopefully our experience this time will help us avoid any possible overreaction.  There might be better ways to fight the disease if we are not expecting 1% or more of the population to die."
2020-04-10 18:00:16,"Whenever a country lifts restrictions, early or later, the country won't go back.

Telling residents to self-quarantine AFTER telling them they can go back out just isn't going to fly. Some residents will comply, but most will say: ""Government officials are now telling me I should stay at home again. Aren't these the same people who told me last week it was OK to go back out?""

Ain't going to happen. The attitude of most residents will be: ""Sorry. Been there, done that. Not going to do it again.""

In short, lifting restrictions is an irrevocable decision."

History shows that presidents have been willing to accept war casualties if it helps them politically.

 Recently we learned that Nixon wanted to disrupt peace talks in Vietnam in the waning days of the 1968 campaign for fear that progress toward ending the war would hurt his chances for the presidency.   

Would Donald Trump and his enablers sacrifice American lives in this ""war"" for political gain?

Does anyone have a doubt?"

My father was born in 1911 in a small apartment on Mott Street, little Italy. He lost his brother on Armistice Day 1918,  succumbing to the influenza. My uncle was one in a family of 10, the only family member to die. My grand father emigrated to America in 1902 and worked on the docks as a long Shore man, struggling to provide the bare essentials for his family through and after the pandemic, never seeking any handouts, assistance nor food. He provided for his family.  I'm sure my grandfather never thought of deep inequities in American society and its health care system. If that thought had ever crossed his mind, he would never have emigrated from Italy by himself and then have his wife and infant come at a later date. The families emigrating to Queens are not thinking of inequities and the health care system. Compared to my ancestors, they have benefits which were not dreamed of by people emigrating to America in the early 1900's. Fortunately times have changed and our country has shown its ability to help those in need."
2020-04-10 17:51:54,"I have (almost) no doubt that we in CA will ""quarantine"" longer than in most states, but sooner or later restrictions will end everywhere. 

Whenever America ""reopens,"" we'd better have a cure or vaccine in place. That will be the only real solution.

Selective reopening won't be the answer, as many workers who've lost their jobs because they stayed home as their governor directed will wonder why their counterparts in neighboring states or countries are still getting regular paychecks. And some people who live in still-closed areas will travel to nearby reopened areas to shop, bringing the virus with them.

Infections and deaths will increase whenever restrictions are lifted, but ""spike"" is almost certainly an exaggeration. Restrictions have been lifted, for example, in South Korea, Japan and Hong Kong, any of which would gladly compare its infection/deaths rate to New York's."

 “Somehow, I don’t see it for myself,” Mr. Trump said. “I just don’t.”   But its not about you Trump; it is about others since you have had recent contact with the positive Brazilian official who had it. After so many lies how do we know you tested negative? It takes some time to manifest anyway.
Didn't he say when denying the Steele Dossier that he was a germaphobe? Not according  to Stormy and Karen,. Do we get to revisit his dossier denial?
He is not a germaphobe since a germaphobe would wear the mask
I saw his latest litany of lies about testing. It was an incoherent jumble of incomplete absurdities. Her was half-saying nobody did as much testing and that unspecified people from overseas were  asking how he did it. It was flat out preposterous lying. It was terrifyingly ridiculous that this guy is the president of the USA in a pandemic. Lets face it, his negligence and incoherence and his fact-free misleading rants seeped in senility has contributed to the death of thousands of Americans.

SARS was a wet market test project and China had almost 20 years to close these fetid places and begin to de-emphasize the consumption of civets, bats, pangolins, whatever...among its population. It didn't and the world is now at war and doing things that weren't even done in real world wars, like closing all pubs in Britain and shutting down the most important religious holidays on the Christian and Jewish calendars.

At that time, we will be roughly at the peak of COVID-19 cases and deaths in states that are lagging NY, NJ and WA--especially Florida and Texas. I'm baffled that after being told a million times the same thing, he still insists on putting the nation and millions of its citizens in grave danger. 

Infections for COVID-19--deadly and non-deadly alike--go on a roughly 4-week cycle. A typical person gets infected on Day 1, and between Day 10 and Day 14 (roughly 2 weeks), that person shows signs of an infection. If that person is among the lucky 80%, the symptoms will be mostly asymptomatic. If that person is among the unlucky 20%, that person will show serious symptoms, and possibly need to be hospitalized. That phase lasts about 2 weeks. Right now we're seeing a ramp-up in cases and deaths in the states that were not struck first. This thing is still roiling the country. 

If Trump insists on opening up on May 1, we will see another death in spikes, more panic, more confusion. 

We are paying a high price for electing someone so inept and impatient. He has the attention span of a 13-year-old with ADHD. He is psychologically unprepared to lead us through the long-term complexities of a pandemic.

This is the consequence of the fulfillment of the GOP's unstated--but clear--policies over the past 40 years of genocide by malign neglect, targeting non-white people, LGBTQ people, the elderly, and the poor. Tthis is what you get when you allow an epidemic to perform genocide on a massive scale at ""little or no cost"" as compared with gun-based or gas-chamber based genocides of the past.

They reject truth, facts, science, experience, competence and perhaps most importantly compromise. The trump party doesn't compromise.  Ever.

This is not a sustainable or effective way to move forward. Is simply reopening everything at once, as Trump suggests, a good idea? Absolutely not. Is keeping our society closed for several months without a clear way to mitigate economic disaster a good idea? Also no. Remember, ""economic disaster"" is not just for Fortune 500 companies; it also means the service worker who is weeks without a paycheck or healthcare.

Based on the new death figure of $60k, I have never seen one bit of factual support for a claim that our medical system cannot handle the volume of our treatment needs.  Understand, we are not preventing people from getting the virus, only DELAYING them from getting it, and if you are one of those people at risk for dying from the virus, we are not changing that risk, only delaying its onset.

For better or worse, that is how most Americans feel -- especially those who lose their jobs while their counterparts in neighboring states or countries keep theirs (and maybe even serve customers who've traveled into their area BECAUSE it's open). 

The economic effects of the stay-at-home orders won't end any time soon. In CA, for example, plumbers are exempt, but demand for plumbers is way down. That probably won't change much after the stay-at-home order is lifted, whenever that occurs.

I have been inside the hotel room at an extended stay hotel for over a month. The windows are nailed shut.  I am at the extended stay hotel as I no longer have a home. Now, I can not look for a home, due to the pandemic.

I have been trapped inside a hotel room for over a month. I feel as if I am going to lose my mind.

The government of Pakistan has order people to stay at home.
& is sending  FREE masks to  each and ever person.It doesn't expect people to try to sew masks ,and ones that are not N-95 masks as the U.S. government does.

The U.S. government must find some way to provide N-95 masks to every American. If Pakistan can provide  every Pakistani with an N-95 mask, the U.S. Government should be able to do the same.

I can't go on like this. I am TRAPPED. I need fresh air. I  can't go on like this .

What am I and other  Americans who are not ""staying-at -home"" in spacious homes with backyards supposed to do to maintain our sanity ?"

A month ago, before the first known case, a prediction that 100,000 people already had the virus was released.  The state was shut down within a week.  For a month we have been looking at people with the most symptoms, and have only found 1 in 10 people tested, about 6000 total.  Half the state should be infected if 100,000 was even close.  After 3 weeks of testing, the peak was predicted at 10,000 new cases a day.  3 days later, 1600.  Social distancing can’t explain these predictions.  Neither can models, unless they are miserably inaccurate.  Until test can detect how many people already had the virus and are already immune, I can’t believe anything a model projects. We can’t even find 6% of the people who were thought to have already had the virus, let alone the bleak predictions forecast after social distancing took place."

We could continue to require office work from home and limited restaurant seating for example.  We can also continue to limit travel and large events.

When lock-downs were started the idea was to keep hospitals able to operate humanely.  This has happened and should remain a priority.  But now it seems like the idea is to stay closed until there are no more deaths which is admirable but totally unrealistic."

2020-04-10 18:51:19,"Related to this rush to open businesses,  I read an article in The Guardian titled:   ""Democracy doesn’t matter to the defenders of ‘economic freedom’""

The article describes the 'economic freedom' indices derived by such groups as Heritage Foundation, Cato Institute, and Frasier Institute who are all following the philosophies of Milton Friedman.  

In their world, 'economic freedom' trumps societal needs and the 'freest' countries using these indices are the countries now showing the most unrest e.g.  Chile and  Hong Kong.  By the way, these indices are being used by our government to determine favorable status countries.

This portion of the article caught my eye:

""The definition of freedom they used meant that democracy was a moot point, monetary stability was paramount and any expansion of social services would lead to a fall in the rankings. Taxation was theft, pure and simple, and austerity was the only path to the top.

“The ‘right’ to food, clothing, medical services, housing or a minimal income level,” the authors wrote, was nothing less than “‘forced labor’ requirements [imposed] on others.” The director of the index translated the vision into policy advice a few years later, writing in a public memo to the Canadian prime minister that poverty could be eliminated through a simple solution: “End welfare. Reinstitute poorhouses and homes for unwed mothers.”""

""And if the choice is between a continued total shutdown or a gradual reopening starting with those who have antibodies, who would *not* be in support of the latter?""

It's not going to happen that way. 

Many people who stayed home and never got sick are going to feel ""punished"" just for doing what their governor told them to do, especially if they see that the ""re-opened"" economy favors those who DID get sick (and thus developed antibodies). At least some of those favored workers will have ignored ""stay at home"" orders, and they will be rewarded, with jobs, for having done so.

That's not going to happen.

The ""cure"" for this virus hasn't been found yet, though I'm still confident it soon will be. Many people say hydroxychloroquine is NOT the cure, and it may not be but we don't know that now. It's being tested further, right now, and I do appreciate the FDA's usual stickler attitude toward any new drug. 

Nevertheless, that stickler attitude is the very reason we have movies such as ""Dallas Buyers' Club,"" and many doctors already are prescribing hydroxychloroquine to treat coronavirus patients. ABC-TV, for example, recently reported on a doctor in LA who says that hydroxychloroquine, by itself, is useless, but that  hydroxychloroquine combined with a zinc-based medication has made all of the doctor's ""seriously ill"" coronavirus patients ""symptom-free"" in 8-12 hours.

There is a point at which we have to come to terms with this very sad and horrible dilemma.  Social distancing is not going to turn this country into a happy work from home country- that will be the result for only a small percentage of people.

Applying  this ruling to COVID-19, if someone is infected and exhales the virus, could there be an IDLH atmosphere? How do you know for sure?  You test.   

Be mindful that in this situation you test the source rather than the atmosphere but regardless, if comprehensive testing is required to ensure safety in the workplace, why does Trump think he can “open the country” without the same degree of diligence for citizens at large?

It would never have worked here though for reasons I lack the space to list. Our approach has done better on saving lives, at this moment 55 deaths per million to 85, but the economic dislocation we caused to make that difference is actually rather insane.

There are no good alternatives.  But we need to look at the big picture and ask ourselves if the path we are following, with draconian lockdowns and collapse of world trade, without apparent end,  is truly the correct road to take. The answer is not clear, but we should ask the question."

Question: do the models touted by Donald Trump adjust for this pretty unusual fact?

There are countries where they do ""random testing"", just to get a grip on how wrong their numbers from the actual testing might be. But this is not for the U.S., ""the land of the brave"", the results of this might be too terrible to bear for the average American - or their ""fearless leader"".

So let's just continue to pretend that math is a myth and numbers lie as much as the CIC. My estimate is still one to two million dead Americans by December 1st, especially now that Trump is planing to put America through a second, maybe even a third wave of Corona just to ""look good"" and win the election.

I hope he will be judged by his performance. He said over a month ago that four million test-kits would be available ""next week"". Dr. Fauci said today that TWO million will be available ""next week"" - but a whole month later!

Unbelievable..."
2020-04-10 19:33:06,"""In New York City, gravediggers excavated long trenches to bury hundreds of unclaimed bodies on Hart Island.""

This is very sad but, like every thing else related to this pandemic, is politically charged. When Iranian authorities dug a pair of trenches for Covid-19 victims south of Tehran, soon after disclosing the initial outbreak there, Washington Post reported (Please see 1) that ""their lengths are that of a football field.""  

Trenches are suggestive of mass graves; thus suggestive of a crime or, as a minimum, disrespectful to the victims.  They are also used when the number of those buried is subject to controversy.  Now that the US is also burying its Covid-19 victims in ""long trenches"", it would be interesting to watch how Iranian authorities will be reacting to that.

Instead, he thinks he's a hero for attacking scientists and others who know how to speak the truth and deal in reality. He's just not psychologically wired to take in any other perspective where he is not the centerpiece. Is it utterly futile trying to unravel the psyche of this man? So far, it is.

The people and businesses who have substantial sums of money will undoubtedly survive to a large degree. But what happens to the rest of us? The government is not capable of saving all of us.

At the end of the day, is Trump actually right in stating: the cure is worse than the disease?

Think about it... if we reopen the country during one of the summer months, what will we have left? We no longer live in a world we can all be farmers on some piece of empty land.

I mourn what the death rate could become. I also mourn the number of people who will lose everything. Material possessions are meaningless.

The key takeaway, from my perspective, would then be that many states could have achieved better results from more moderate approaches sustained over a longer time period than sheltering in place over a shorter time period (depending on what exactly the ""shelter in place"" in the model refers to - is this perhaps national rather than state policy? - the article also seems confused or unclear on this).

Consumers will continue to spend when they keep their job and the salary

Workers get there usual salary.  They may work partial (Kurzarbeit) but STILL get full salary.  No need to file for unemployment as in the US

Its easy for the rich and elite to criticize wanting to open the Economy, but doubt their livelihood is at stake. For the rest of America it is crucial we get back to avoid Economic Devastation. It can be done with better testing and monitoring for new infections, until we have the vaccine. 

The President HAS to give a positive message on the economy at this time. For those who listened today and haven't buried their heads in the sand he is saying that is the ambition but it will be done on the advice of the Doctors and in consultation with State Governors and other advisers.

2020-04-10 18:29:26,"6 new coronaviruses discovered in bats

Scientists have discovered six entirely new coronaviruses lurking in bats in Myanmar. 

These viruses are in the same family as the SARS-CoV-2 virus that is currently spreading across the globe; but the researchers said the newbies aren't closely related genetically to SARS-CoV-2 or to the two other coronaviruses that cause severe infections in humans — severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), which caused the 2002-2003 pandemic, and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS).

The researchers discovered the viruses while surveying bats in Myanmar as part of a government-funded program called PREDICT to identify infectious diseases that have the potential to hop from animals to humans. 

And bats are prime suspects, as the mammals are thought to host thousands of yet-to-be-discovered coronaviruses. 

SARS-CoV-2, which causes the disease COVID-19, is also thought to have originated in bats before taking up residence in humans, possibly taking a detour through some intermediary host first.

2020-04-10 20:04:17,"A number of commenters deliberately or accidentally confuse final CDC death estimates from earlier viruses with ongoing current specific case counts, and use that to show we are overreacting.  The 'hey, regular flu kills 20,000-50,000 Americans a year - so this isn't so terrible ' argument.

This can be confusing unless you read about it. It was to me.

Here's a really good article explaining how this works; 

<a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2020/03/27/those-covid-19-death-toll-figures-are-incomplete"" target=""_blank"">https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2020/03/27/those-covid-19-death-toll-figures-are-incomplete</a>/

From the article; ""Trump is comparing apples and oranges. The figures he cites for the swine flu and seasonal influenza are after-the-fact estimates that try to account for all excess deaths that could be, in some way, attributed to a flu infection. Studies indicate that the official lab counts may be missing as many as 9 in 10 deaths.""

It explains that those big flu-related death numbers we hear about each year are always much higher than the day-to-day reports. Because after the fact, the CDC goes back and looks at spikes in things like pneumonia deaths, infection deaths, unexplained deaths and makes an educated estimate of how many were flu related.

So we are likely to see, months from now a MUCH higher number when the CDC does their similar estimates for this time.

The lack of making this clear to the public is a huge problem, and has helped lead many to conclude - wrongly - that COVID isn't that bad."
2020-04-10 18:52:49,"Someone needs to tell Trump to stop talking and back away.

Disease Control, Civil Liberties, and Mass Testing — Calibrating Restrictions during the Covid-19 Pandemic...When and how will restrictions be unwound? 


April 9, 2020
David M. Studdert, L.L.B., Sc.D., and Mark A. Hall, J.D.

Urgent responses to the Covid-19 pandemic have halted movement and work and dramatically changed daily routines for much of the world’s population. In the United States, many states and localities have ordered or urged residents to stay home when able and to practice physical distancing when not. Meanwhile, unemployment is surging, schools are closed, and businesses have been shuttered.

Resistance to drastic disease-control measures is already evident. Rising infection rates and mortality, coupled with scientific uncertainty about Covid-19, should keep resentment at bay — for a while. But the status quo isn’t sustainable for months on end; public unrest will eventually become too great.

When and how will restrictions be unwound?

2020-04-10 20:06:18,"The global death toll just surpassed 100 thousand (I'm guessing that some of these deaths could have been attributed to a cause other than Covid, but that's just a guess).  Certainly a tragedy for all those folks and the people that love them but we're acting like the death toll just surpassed 10 million.  This ""cure"" is going to be way worse than the disease, that is a guarantee."
2020-04-10 18:54:44,"“No one knows more about the Coronavirus than me.”    —    Trump
""The party told you to reject the evidence of your eyes and ears. It was their final, most essential command."" — George Orwell, “1984”
This is a key pillar of the trump agenda widely abetted by powerful GOP politicians whose thirst for power manifests this new reality of an emerging authoritative political system. The nation can  no longer tolerate the pathetic charade of a recklessly inept puppet president and must decide to get rid of him."
2020-04-10 20:04:55,"Anyone surprised by the number of comments promoting re-opening the U.S. for business? Conservatives/Republicans more concerned about the profits than people. Now we know the truth they are not “pro-life” they see : the Greed Over People Party! 

We must be patient and quell the spread. The problem from the beginning has been, Trump’s resistance to shutting down the nation! In the meantime, we LOST THREE WEEKS in which we could have STOPPED the spread of Covid19 aggressively! 

Those who want to open the U.S. for business...go right ahead! But KNOW: YOU will be held accountable for the disaster  YOU will unleash on our nation!"
2020-04-10 19:30:11,"Please thank the delivery people.  I got hand sanitizer today!  My delivery person got gloves, masks, and a free dinner.  They are risking thier lives."
2020-04-10 18:57:56,"As social distancing and lock downs flatten infection rate curves around the globe the magnitude of Trump's failed decision making is more stark.

Trump's response is to deploy the time honored tactic of ""fear of the unseen enemy lurking in the shadows""  as taught to him by Roy Cohn who harnessed the ""Red Menace"" on behalf of the GOP in the 1950s."
2020-04-10 19:35:55,"Let's see if the biggest coward and draft dodger in American history in The Impeached Forever 45th is so brave to visit a Walmart location for one retailer, to assist their workers in stocking shelves, along with talking directly to their market type of shoppers within 6 feet, without as he stated ever to wear any mask as recommended.

Otherwise, the best means to protest against Trump's wanting the entire country to reopen economically wise ahead of medical experts warnings and the 100% containment of coronavirus, is to simply disobey him and not return to work, even if some money hungry greedy first retail business owners or of any field order you to do so."
2020-04-10 20:12:06,"CDC 4/8/20, early release of report on antibodies against SAR CoV2: 

Serology tests are still in developmental stages. 

Neutralizing antibodies are the ones that confer immunity. Neutralizing antibodies vary in how long they are produced by our immune system; some confer life long immunity, others need to be boosted by vaccines.

Not all antibodies confer immunity  e.g.  Hepatitis C, HIV all stimulate antibody production but these antibodies are not protective. 

Even if non-protective, antibody testing provides valuable information on the spread of a pathogen in populations.

Serums from persons recovered from covid 19 are being tested for efficacy as a means of passive immunity.

SARS CoV 2 is completely novel; almost every medical institution is working intensively to understand and control this pathogen. Don't jump on scientists for not knowing everything immediately. 

And don't listen to nonsense from politicians with no scientific/medical training. They might just recommend some unproved drug as hydroxychloroquine. Would you go to an unlicensed doctor?"
2020-04-10 19:00:39,"tuned back in to Trump News at 2:45 PM Fri to hear him say: ""this past week our stock market had it's biggest gain in 50 years"". He didn't mention that since April 4'th USA's deaths from the coronavirus increased from 8,200 to 18,000 SO FAR. He also never mentioned that the Dow declined 36% from Feb 3 to Mar 23-'20."
2020-04-10 21:40:50,"This week while isolated at home I was able to partake in an effort to arrange a plasma donation for a friend.  It was an incredible endeavor -- all involved were reminded of the awesome power of friends and strangers coming together in extremely difficult circumstances.

We also learned much about the use of plasma in a few short days.  Anyone who has had coronavirus and is recovered or recovering should seriously consider ""paying it forward"" with a plasma donation, which has therapeutic use in current patients.

There are many current efforts at coordinating between potential donors, hospitals, doctors and their patients, including information and registries for potential donors at the New York Blood Center, the American Red Cross and the National COVID-19 Convalescent Plasma Project.

I don’t think I am overstating it to say that rapid development, coordination and use of plasma to treat the coronavirus may be the most promising and immediate way forward in mitigating the pandemic's impact until a vaccine is introduced."
2020-04-10 22:01:41,"In reading the Article, it appears that presently the level of threat varies from State to State,  and within a State from area to area.  For example, 80% of the virus in Michigan is purportedly located in  Metro Detroit.  (New York Metro is another example for the respective States of that area.)  Is it possible different containment and travel policies should be implemented for specific areas of high transmission?  If so, could it be conceivable for areas of reduced transmission to carry forward with more limited restrictions? There are two issues operating in tandem-i.e. the control of a pandemic and the collapse of the national economy."
2020-04-10 21:31:44,"I cannot understand what trump has to do with the decision to reopen the economy.  This is nothing more than trumps magical thinking.  The governors mandated these closures, not trump.  There obligation is to their citizens, not trump."
2020-04-10 21:43:15,"""...new federal projections warned of a spike in coronavirus infections if shelter-in-place orders were lifted after only 30 days"" After only? You can't keep society on lock down forever. There will always be someone at risk whether you lift restrictions ""after only"" 30 days, or 60 days, or 90 days. In the meantime people are losing it. This cannot continue indefinitely."
2020-04-10 21:45:08,"Once again Senator McConnell can't even begin to do his job and deal with bipartisan legislation. He's the same man who coordinated with the White House on how to deal with the Impeachment; the same who has a stack of bills approved by the House sitting in some storage room unread. Now once more the White House will send their Secretary to hammer out a deal in which Trump will undermine to get only what he wants. 
This is how ""democracy"" works in the Age of Trump."
2020-04-10 21:45:36,"The models are a bit annoying. I had my own back in January when the virus was taking hold of China and it was actually quite similar to the original government model but we all had the same issue, our models were based on what happened in China. The problem was that China relayed false data but more importantly, China is still quite different than the US. Especially interior cities such as Wuhan. Smoking is still very common amongst men in interior China which throws off the model. Basic Hygiene is different in interior China. For example, people generally do not instinctively cover their mouth when they cough. Although healthcare is perhaps as available as it is in the US, the quality of care in interior China is debatable. So when you have your model based on region with many variables from your own, the model may give you numbers that don’t align with the actual data that is being reflected."
2020-04-10 21:06:24,"With all these entities making masks, there’s no talk on where a person can go to purchase one! With businesses aside from drug stores and supermarkets essentially closed, I think Supermarkets are the logical choice!"
2020-04-10 21:13:11,"I am sure there is always risk of returning to work, but we can't stay at home forever, or until an effective and safe vaccine comes out, which is one year down the road.
Anyone brave enough to return to work will be automatically labeled as selfish and irresponsible by those value a safety more than prosperity. What is so good of getting government hand out while you can create values for society?"
2020-04-10 21:45:17,"On coronavirus, Trump went from stating weeks ago that ""all Americans can get a test,"" to yesterday's words that ""testing all Americans is not gonna happen.""

Even worse, less than just 1% of Americans have been able to receive tests; leaving 99% that can possibly reinfect the country should the stay at home, and social distancing orders be lifted per Trump's political desperation.

Those two separate days' contrasting words by Trump warrant much more than his end politically. They warrant a review as to why since warned last December, he has spit out health misinformation to Americans as if only his life matters. 

But even greater so, Trump has deployed purposeful and willful negligence in his failure to prepare for, and battle properly this warned to intensify into pandemic by time it reached U.S. soil.

In addition, according to words last week by one of MSNBC's legal analysts in Glenn Kirscher, that mishandling neglect and more should make Trump be held criminally liable for all U.S. coronavirus deaths once he leaves office."
2020-04-10 20:59:45,"There's a growing emphasis on antibody testing and giving those who ""pass"" a certificate to return to work. I think we're missing other important considerations that must be ironed out before we can implement a massive antibody testing program.

Beyond discussions about the test itself (false negatives, false positives and how long someone is or isn't immune), I don't hear anyone talking about how to support those who don't have COVID-19 antibodies financially, physically or socially. How are they going to pay their rent? Their mortgages? Their health care? Their groceries? Their utilities? Who decides how much they receive and how often? Do their children have to stay home rather than attend school with their peers?

How do you force people to stay home if they don't ""pass?"" Will they be ostracized? Will neighbors who ""pass"" report neighbors who don't because they're not social distancing? There's already a significant amount of shaming and I can see this being a slippery slope. 

We've got many social, ethical, financial and other considerations to unpack before antibody testing becomes the be-all and end-all that it's being touted as."
2020-04-10 21:41:41,"Since the pandemic will have its largest effects upon dense, highly populated areas (which are more likely to be Democratic than Republican), if Trump and the Republicans followed the Wisconsin model of restricting by-mail voting, that would force the Democratic voters to choose between risking their health and losing their opportunity to vote."
2020-04-10 21:44:18,"The facts remain the facts: humans have no immunity to covid, it's highly contagious and neither a cure for those infected nor a vaccine against the disease is on the horizon anytime soon. 

So Trump can stage is ""grand reopening"" of the US economy whenever he wants--knowing him, there will be some huge, ersatz gold ribbon emblazoned with ""Covid"" that he'll stretch across the floor of the stock exchange and then cut in half with enormous mega scissors--but the facts remain the facts, and the economy is going nowhere fast. 

Smart people who value their lives will  heed the guidance of medical professionals and continue minimizing any contact with others. And the dumb ones who follow Trump's ever utterance will head out, re-spread the disease and we'll soon be back in lockdown again, our hospitals overwhelmed anew."
2020-04-10 21:46:21,Trump wanted to open the whole country back up on May 1st so one of his medical experts leaked these projections to the media to try and get him to stay the course. Let’s see if it works.
2020-04-10 21:50:42,I am willing to live locked down as long as necessary if that helps to contain this nightmare provided that basic necessities such as food remain available.
2020-04-10 22:02:07,"It is not Trump’s decision to reopen. It is up to the governors and county leaders. Unfortunately, some states will blindly follow whatever Trump says. California won’t foolishly open based on Trump’s “judgement”."
2020-04-10 22:15:58,"Which is scarier? The Coronavirus, or Trump making this life-or-death decision for the country? Even with the multitude of unknowns about the virus, and the inevitably that mutations will follow, I find Trump at the switch much harder to stomach. Imagine the bedlam that will ensue. Trump says “Back to work”, cautious governors say no thanks, the Trump apostles loosen the constraints, the virus flares and we’re back in the soup. We can only hope that Fauci and Birx have the fortitude to persevere."
2020-04-10 21:04:58,"A small business loan program is cute.  But trickle down economics aren’t working, never worked, and never will."
2020-04-10 21:08:57,"The economy will ""re-open"" when politicians are frightened by voters angry about loss of earnings and other economic hardship. It will be precisely the ""right"" moment because the balance between public apprehension and public frustration will tip toward the latter. Epidemiologists won't have much to say about it all.

That moment will come and if politicians do not respond to it then we will see massive civil disobedience. The public health scolds won't count for much when a third-billion Americans say ""Enough!""

Groovy theories about ""the failure of capitalism"" will also shut-down fast once angry citizens start making waves. If the suffering becomes bad enough the media will be crucified for being the megaphone for this hysteria.

We only have to wait patiently until things become bad enough. The rest will take care of itself."
2020-04-10 21:36:14,I don't think trump can open the economy without a vaccine that is proven. I know I won't go to movies cafes or any where without looking over my shoulder for ever.
2020-04-10 21:37:53,"It really doesn’t matter now when Trump makes a decision to reopen the Economy. Los Angeles County today extended the stay at home order until May 15. Also, face covering is now mandatory.  Trump has no control over what California does. My dentist in Florida is not going back to work until universal testing is in place. Until there is significant testing done, people will not know who is infected and who is not. So, what rational thinking person will want to be around other people with this uncertainty. Not me!"
2020-04-10 21:59:04,"Trump will meet with business leaders to advise him on when to relax restrictions? Horrifying. No one should be making that decision except medical experts. Putting our lives on the line so business leaders can go on making money? No thanks. You can bet those business leaders aren't the ones that will be getting sick. They, like Trump, will stay safe in their cocoons, while they send the rest of us out to infect each other. Just like the old men who send the young ones to fight the wars, it's the workers who will be sacrificed so business leaders can keep raking in their dividends and profits."
2020-04-10 21:54:19,Donald Trump is the least-qualified human being on earth (or elsewhere) to make a decision that involves moral tradeoffs between potential loss of human life and economic catastrophe.
2020-04-10 21:26:13,"There’s no magical way around this.  Until a drug cocktail or treatment emerges which drastically reduces the percentage of people this kills, you can’t just “open up the economy” again (and hopefully this is all followed by a vaccine).

There’s a reason every country is following the same playbook right now.  If they found a magical way to keep the economy churning while managing this virus, it would be happening.  Communist countries, dictatorships, democracies, theocracies, right wing, left wing, all having to shut down.

You also can’t just “restart the economy” either.  You will have huge labour disruptions, people won’t eat at restaurants out of fear of contracting the virus, kids won’t return to school, parents and grandparents will suddenly be living with their families fearful of a potential COVID outbreak ravaging their care centre, international travel will not be resuming anytime soon.... so where does this go exactly?  

More deaths and illness in some vain pursuit of good economic numbers to get one human being re-elected?  Gross."
2020-04-10 21:22:48,"I was mystified at today's coronavirus task force briefing (April 10) and had to check the C-span transcript to make sure I heard right: President Trump said he had ""absolute authority"" to override the governors on the decision of opening up the country again. This is NOT what I understood to be the case earlier and have no clue where he gets the legal authority.  Does anyone know? I sent an inquiry to my Senator's office about this."
2020-04-10 21:39:41,"'President Trump said Friday that the question of when to relax federal social distancing guidelines was “the biggest decision I’ll ever make.”'

Two observations: (1) sane people are listening to health experts and their governors, not to him, and (2) a majority of people in the US would not trust Donald Trump with string, let alone a decision affecting their health.

I threw my ""presidential guidelines"" postcard in the trash unread. I'll take my health advice from the NIH/CDC, thanks."
2020-04-10 21:19:17,"Enough of this nonsense.

So we can't reopen our country for business until there is a vaccine? Just so you know, vaccines will not get rid of our problems.

According to CDC, vaccination reduces the risk of flu illness by between 40% and 60%. Everybody can't get a vaccine for medical reasons. That drops the number even further.

At this point, we have better odds to open back up and treat with hydroxychloroquine for those who believe in it."
2020-04-10 21:19:54,"We can't throw away our civil liberties, jobs, bank accounts, educations, mental health, and friends and family over this.

Please understand that these numbers are only showing us who is dying WITH the virus NOT FROM the virus.  Vast majority of people were already sick.  

Old people (and some young) getting sick and dying is a part of life.  We have to accept this and carry on."
2020-04-10 22:12:54,"If social distancing keeps 85% of the population from getting it, then won't those 85% get it as soon as we go back to normal?  Its highly infectious, and asymptomatically spread... so why does anyone think we can go back to normal before there's a vaccine?  We can flatten the curve and delay the inevitable infection, but if a vaccine is truly 18 months out, it's only a delay."
2020-04-10 21:26:07,"Trump has never had any impulse control, and when it comes to the question of America going back to work, the interest of the public health will be sacrificed to Trump’s most urgent impulse - the impulse to be reelected and to keep the justice system from having its way with him. 

As we speak, a diaspora of “snowbirds” from America’s latest hotspot (Florida) is headed north and returning to the the northern states, perhaps sewing the seeds of a second wave that could well occur anyway if the quarantine’s lifted too soon.  

God help us."

2020-04-10 22:01:12,"In Trump's mind, the COVID 19 triage is as follows: 1. Save the economy by getting people back to work, which 2. Enhances my chance for reelection and 3. Whoever dies, dies, oh well, as long as I get numbers 1 and 2 done."
2020-04-10 21:21:28,"If a spike is seen improving his election prospects with a cost of 100,000 deaths, he and his advisors will see it as a small enough price to pay. Brown people will pay disproportionately, and they don't vote for him. 

How many deaths has his bumbling caused at this point, and what is a few hundred thousand more? Surely he doesn't and won't accept responsibility for any of them."
2020-04-10 21:45:24,"Why is the media humoring Trump in his delusion that he has anything to say about when “the country” relaxes restrictions and re-opens businesses? Trump had nothing to do with the decision to shut things down - these decisions were made by governors on a state-by-state basis. Likewise, Trump will have nothing to say about when and his things re-open - those decisions will again be made by governors. It’s his own megalomania and delusion of grandeur to imagine that he is actually has any control over any of these decisions. Don’t play along!"
2020-04-10 21:31:05,Hearing a lot of the Republican philosophy on health care: just let ‘em die. The problem is the allowing Covid-19 to run rampant will overwhelm and destroy our health care system. How will this affect our economy?
2020-04-10 22:06:22,"The virus was slow in showing its real teeth in our country. Trump was even slower in showing he didn't have teeth at all. The absolute mishandling by Trump of the pandemic is really abysmal. It is very disturbing that most of what happened seems to be a modern theater representation of what can be read in “The Plague” written by Albert Camus in the 1940s. For example:
Quote “People in town are getting nervous, that is a fact” doctor Richard admitted. “And, of course all sorts of rumors are going round. The Prefect said to me “Take prompt action if you like but don’t attract attention” The Prefect is personally convinced that it’s a false alarm. Unquote.
Maybe if Trump read “The Plague” sometime between October and December 2019 he would have done a better job."
2020-04-10 21:03:13,"Trump wants the stay at home warnings lifted to reopen the business world and more, due not only for his political survival come November; but also due to the fact that he is the coronavirus himself being happy with the death counts, even if lower than its models had initially projected.

One could only imagine what next viral ruckus he will initiate in America, be it one of another illness spread; or of his normal crooked means including politically as an autocratic, and ""only to benefit myself"" president turned Dictator once sworn in."

2020-04-10 21:52:37,"What on earth is Gilead doing with an UNCONTROLLED trial of remdesivir?

What have they proved? That the drug isn't extremely dangerous. Well, probably not but, presumably, Gilead knew that already.

This is exactly the thinking that is getting hydroxychloroquine given randomly, in combination with other random drugs, to pretty much anybody with Covid-19 regardless of severity on the basis that this will provide 'proof' of the drug's efficacy.

Just suppose that hydroxychloroquine really does benefit certain people with Covid-19. This crazy, Trump driven, therapeutic free for all pretty much guarantees that the benefit will remain hidden."
2020-04-10 22:03:51,"It's 7 months to the November election. Lots of time for liars to try and revise history. The recent actions of Trump and his Republican lackeys in Congress, as they try to take advantage of this pandemic, have confirmed that we're up against not only immorality in this election, but also a propaganda machine that will spew whatever despicable lies it deems necessary to win.
With the debacle in Wisconsin and the inexcusable SCOTUS decision, we're not on a level playing field. We must take that into account and use it to motivate us to mobilize all of our resources. It is crucial for all of us to contribute to the Democratic effort in whatever way we can, at all levels and beyond our own votes.

The Trump administration has rushed through more than $760 million in contracts outside the usual bidding process during its haphazard coronavirus response.

 It’s highly unusual for the White House to step into FEMA’s supply bidding process.

2020-04-10 22:21:40,"There have been repeated reports that trump was briefed on the threat of the coronavirus by both his intelligence agencies and the military, possibly as early as November 2019, and well into January of this year. High level White House staffers met with senators in early February when senators asked the White House to request emergency funding. The White House refused. Senators asked again, and the White House refused again.
Even now, the situation is still being badly mishandled. Governors have been complaining for weeks over the absurdity of having to bid against each other and FEMA for critical medical supplies, yet this administration continues to allow this situation to persist. It's not clear whom governors should talk to: Trump told Schumer discuss his supply chain concerns with an admiral, but the NY Times said a few days ago that Navarro was in charge of the supply chain, while Pence is supposedly leading the team, yet Jared Kushner seems to be sending out equipment on an ad hoc basis. There is still no plan for the eventual wide-spread testing that will be needed to allow people to leave their homes to do their jobs, as Trump insists he wants them to do. In fact, Trump has consistently rejected a substantial federal role in the testing process. The response of the federal government has been sorely inadequate in many ways. This is not an attempt to ""take any opportunity to bash Trump."" These are legitimate criticisms."

This is should be about science and saving lives, not about filling business coffers and saving year end bonuses, but I'm not holding my breath as to which faction will hold sway in Trump's decision to lift restrictions.  Money is always at the bottom of Trump's decisions.
Certainly an antibody test would be the most helpful in determining if someone had been infected with and recovered from the virus, as long as there is a known antibody titer to measure against to insure immunity had been conferred.

I don't have a problem with giving aide to another country, as long as it doesn't diminish supplies that the U.S. would need. Trump then tried to blame Obama for the shortage of the national stockpile, after he had 3 years to replenish it. Despite warnings by the Obama administration about a situation like what we're currently facing, in which states would have to rely on the national stockpile, it was the trump administration that neglected to replenish it.

In a rush to cow-tow to his declining base, Trump is insisting we 'turn the office lights on' again, now.

2020-04-10 22:56:19,"Fantastic quote by Singer published in the NYTimes magazine today, which provides some food for thought:

""We are currently impoverishing the economy, which means we are reducing our capacity in the long term to provide exactly those things that people are talking about that we need — better health care services, better social-security arrangements to make sure that people aren’t in poverty. There are victims in the future, after the pandemic, who will bear these costs. The economic costs we incur now will spill over, in terms of loss of lives, loss of quality of life, and loss of well-being.""

""I think the assumption, and it has been an assumption in this discussion, that we have to do everything to reduce the number of deaths, is not really the right assumption. Because at some point we are willing to trade off loss of life against loss of quality of life. No government puts every dollar it spends into saving lives. And we can’t really keep everything locked down until there won’t be any more deaths. So I think that’s something that needs to come into this discussion. How do we assess the overall cost to everybody in terms of loss of quality of life, loss of well-being, as well as the fact that lives are being lost?"""

Of course the timing still has to be done in consultation with health experts but at whatever point we do go back it seems their will be spikes in infection
It is also now clear that the poor are dying at much greater rates. 
As we are in the bail out mode and were making sure (for which i am grateful) that businesses have access to credit, offering help to companies that keep their employees and offering more generous help to those unemployed perhaps the best thing we can do would be to ""bail out"" those who no longer have health insurance or never had it. Perhaps a year or so of Medicaid for not all but for those who can not afford health insurance or who have lost their jobs and benefits would be a way to keep us all healthier

We have all asked and asked, why?  It seems to just not make sense. I posit this.  He ran on a break up government campaign.  It would only take a small push by someone to whom much is owed, Putin, to remind him of this and no one would even notice. In other words, Putin says slow roll all effective federal response, take down successful pillars of democracy or else.  If asked how those steps will be concealed or their motive concealed, he will feign ignorance and continue to say, We're not supply clerks,  and this: We can't stand on street corners to give out tests. And this: The recently fired IG - fill in blank and/or title, did a terrible job. Thats it.  We are none the wiser as to motives for such seemingly nonsensical moves.  Meanwhile the strings getting pulled tighter.  Putin can see that no money will be coming his way, unless the $2T somehow works its way into the personal presidential coffers.

Unless you test, anyone going to is engaging in Russian Roulette.  This is going to be very tough to balance - how to start getting people back to work while not endangering public health.   Testing has to be nation wide because people are so mobile - just having some states do it isn't going to work unless they close their own state borders.   Trump is really worried about one thing and that is his re-election.  I can't help but think one reason he want's to ""open up"" is he wants to go back to having his large rallies.

Meanwhile, trump was still holding rallies, playing golf and dragging his feet on testing because he wanted to keep the numbers, which is all he cares about, artificially low. 
Had Biden been in charge, the federal government would've begun a robust response to the coming pandemic in early January, utilizing the expertise available in the pandemic response office that President Obama had set up, which Biden wouldn't have fired. That expertise would've fast tracked mass testing capabilities and medical equipment production, which would've enabled a public health attack on the virus and a build up of hospital resources for the gravely ill.

2020-04-10 23:45:44,"While we continue to take seriously social distancing and other measures to alleviate the effects of this virus, we need more responsible and consistent messaging from the government. These dire projections are not ""facts"" written in stone but possibilities based on the imperfect process of modeling. Right now it appears the numbers are better than the dire hundreds of thousands stated last week by Dr. Birx. We need to evaluate this date in relationship to annual mortality rates from other infectious diseases to get perspective. The truth is we still don't know all we need to know about this virus, how it might behave and how people develop antibodies. Let's remember that the vast majority of people do not get seriously ill, are asymptomatic, and that majority of serious cases occur in people with preexisting vulnerabilities. This in no way lessons are concern or need to be vigilant, but we need more perspective beyond the ""no end in sight"" somewhat apocalyptic views in these reports.
Humanity cannot live in isolation forever. 
I'm very concerned about civil liberties. Remember the Patriot Act.
People are fearful; dire forecasts only heighten stress and exacerbate hoarding and, I'm afraid, will soon have consequences in mental health and social problems.

Part of what makes this crisis so frightening is the knowledge that we can't trust this administration to tell us the truth about anything -- certainly not anything that might affect Trump's re-election chances.

But they aren’t in their homes now because he said they must be. 

We’re sitting here inside because while he delayed taking action our 50 state governors (OK, those with intelligence and integrity) such as our wonderful Tony Evers here in Wisconsin were willing to call the shot. And when President Trump says come out again, this will only happen because those same governors again reaffirm that decision.

And that’s the third rail for Trump - he doesn’t want an accounting of how many people have / have had covid-19 nor an accounting of how many people have died from it. 

Stuck between a rock and a hard place.

However, our country has a tremendous systemic problem that we have so many people who are out of a job and face real danger of not being able to feed their families, keep their hourse, keep their health insurance, etc. Those are real problems.

The lesson to be learned from this is: Our country's obsession (since Reagan) of ""Government is evil"" and ""capitalism is the answer"" and ""trickle down enconomics"" is wrong and dangerous. It has left our country unprepared to face a crisis like this, which we have known would eventually come.

I got an e-mail from a cousing in Norway. Norway has been hit fairly hard by the virus; but their country isn't crashing like ours is. If you're furloughed, the govt gives you 60-80% of your salary. If you have children that are now at home because schools are closed, the govt gives you 10 extra paid sick days from your job (normally 10; now 20). If you get sick, verified by a doctor, you continue to get your salary.

My cousing needed a tumor removed. In the US, cancer patients are now not being treated. In Norway, she had no wait to be scheduled. The govt paid for her transport to Oslo, and paid for a hotel room for her husband to be with her.

This crisis isn't tearing their country apart like ours. They're not facing a total collapse of their economy or their social infrastructure.

I intend to take video around my rural East Alabama county on Easter Sunday. On 3/22, these churches were packed when I drove around like Miss Nosy Rosy to see which churches were open. 6 out of 15 were open. Over 100 cars. How many will I count this Sunday? God I hope the answer is “none.” 

There are many small rural churches where the people feel that the government cannot fell churches what to do. We have a Max 10 order signed by the governor, but I’m going to go out on a limb and say that this won’t be respected by everyone.

If the crowd at Walmart today is any indication, people are still going to be celebrating Easter. By the way, I thought Walmart was supposed to be limiting how many people can shop at one time? This store’s parking lot was packed. I didn’t go inside Walmart, and don’t intend to, but I drove past it to go pick up food in Georgia. I have been driving a long way away to keep from having to go inside a store in my county because I know that many people aren’t taking COVID seriously. They’re not distancing.

Businesses are closed and workers are languishing at home because the government ordered them to close and stay home.  This, in and of itself, is totally unprecedented.  The shutdown was caused not by financial recklessness or by an underlying weakness in the economy, but by a sudden and diabolically novel virus that originated in China and that has since wreaked havoc throughout the entire globe.  Before the virus swiftly took hold, the US economy was running smoothly on all cylinders and on the upswing.

With that said, the devastating & far-reaching effects of a prolonged economic shutdown can indeed be far worse than the original coronavirus problem in the first place.  A number of Asian countries have already begun to reopen businesses across the board, with people returning to work while at the same time exercising hygienic due diligence – wearing masks & gloves, handwashing and avoiding physical contact in crowded public areas.  There’s no reason why we can’t do the same here in the USA…the economic center of the world.    

The decision to either prolong or end the economic shutdown is not a simple dichotomy, but a complex continuum.

Trump on a daily basis, brags to reporters that the U.S. has the best testing program in the world.  If he believes his own rhetoric, then testing should become a major priority of the national response to the pandemic.

2020-04-11 01:00:13,"In our rural county, about 75% of us have been practicing social distancing, and about 50% of us have been wearing masks for the past week.

A friend of mine was just diagnosed tonight.  He had been tested on Monday (5 day lag for results).  He had been sick for a few days before that.  He and his wife practiced social distancing, and he still got sick.

Now his wife has to self-quaratine for 2 weeks, living in the same house but not being allowed to be near each other.  Their daughter who lives with them had been visiting her boyfriend; now she has to stay away.

These are highly educated people, well-connected in our community, who voluteer for civic organizations, etc.  We live in one of the least-populated counties in the state.

No one is immune from this.  There is still a lot we don't know about the medical/health aspects of the virus.  Our healthcare system is clearly inadequate for dealing with this crisis.  It's scary; and then it hits someone close to you, and it's terrifying.

Meanwhile, the country's obsessed about getting back to work, even while hundredsof thousands of us are sick and dying, and will continue over the next month?  Meanwhile, the Rightwingnuts still spew lies and hatred at the other half of our citizenry?  Meanwhile, the Republicans still care more about ""winning"" than about their oath to serve ALL of our country?

This is a country that spent TRILLIONS of dollars on a war in Iraq and another in Afghanistan long after anybody even remembered what the wars were fought for. But more unemployment checks to get an epidemic under control? Nah, let nature take it's course.

By the way, the global recovery rate vs death rate is about 4:1 right now, which means the odds of recovery vs death is currently worse than playing Russian Roulette with a revolver. Hopefully those numbers will get better as more medical equipment and hospital capacity becomes available. But right now, it's a heck of a gamble."

""As long as we give enhanced unemployment checks to everyone who is out of work, doesn't it make the most sense to staff essential jobs with those who have antibodies?""

You get antibodies if you've had the disease. Most people who got the disease got it innocently. But some people who got the disease disobeyed ""stay at home"" orders. When others see someone who's still working because he or she has an ""immunity card,"" how will others know which group he or she is in? A worker who lost his or her job but didn't get sick will effectively be punished for doing exactly what the governor ordered -- stay home. And that out-of-work worker may well wonder if the man or woman who's still on the job came by his or her antibodies honestly."
2020-04-11 01:03:14,"I don't quite get why the comparison to seasonal flu isn't apt. If 50,000 Americans die from the flu each year, and that number would be reduced 40-60% if everyone got a flu shot (roughly half of Americans don't), aren't we effectively saying it's OK with us if others die? I understand that the coronavirus leads to a much higher death rate than applies to the seasonal flu, but isn't that simply a quantitative argument? If I don't get a flu shot, get a mild case of the flu, recover from it but infect your grandmother, and she dies from the flu, haven't I killed your grandmother?

What am I missing here?"
2020-04-11 01:19:36,"Our county's running average daily death rate is at its highest level yet, even though we are under a strict shelter-in-place policy that folks are following relatively well. Don't even look at the Washington State data; their numbers are two weeks behind. We are, in all likelihood, now looking at a shoulder in the curve, caused (after the expected time lag) by the initiation of the shelter-in-place policies four weeks ago. Only if the relaxation of the shelter-in-place policy is done very smartly will we not have a large surge that would overwhelm our health care capabilities. We have done very little testing here and no randomized testing. If we were to want to relax our social isolation policy now, it would be contingent on doing a ton more testing now, including random testing. Without that testing, how ever could we relax the policy smartly?"

So now, these same people think that they will go back to work, make lots of money, and not be the ones who die. Because they are special!

Of course, Trump, the GOP, and the business cronies care NOTHING about low wage workers dying. Didn’t paltry Pence tell food workers how essential their jobs are to enable Americans to eat meat, for instance, and urge them to keep working? Should they continue despite deplorable and unsafe conditions, no personal protective equipment, and insanely, insultingly low wages, and even when they’re sick? Sure, open the economy, cause more deaths. The billionaires with their tax cuts might or might not be fine, but many probably have their own ventilators.

Here, a collection of the biggest lies he’s told as the nation barrels toward a public-health and economic calamity. This post will be updated as needed.

On the Nature of the Virus
When: Friday, February 7, and Wednesday, February 19

The claim: The coronavirus would weaken “when we get into April, in the warmer weather—that has a very negative effect on that, and that type of a virus.”

The truth: It’s too early to tell if the virus’s spread will be dampened by warmer conditions. Respiratory viruses can be seasonal, but the World Health Organization says that the new coronavirus “can be transmitted in ALL AREAS, including areas with hot and humid weather.”

When: Thursday, February 27
The claim: The outbreak would be temporary: “It’s going to disappear. One day it’s like a miracle—it will disappear.”

The truth: Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, warned days later that he was concerned that “as the next week or two or three go by, we’re going to see a lot more community-related cases.”

2020-04-10 19:06:04,"Unfortunately for all those who want to ""get back to work,"" the modern economy is based on consumers. Consumers aren't going to consume if they are terrified of getting this virus, of their beloved family members getting the virus, or of the impact on their finances or their job of the next spike in cases. I know I'm not. I'm not going to the movies, out to eat, on vacation, or spend any disposable income until there is a vaccination or really good treatment. And I and my husband still have our jobs. And we used to eat out a lot and go on vacation and go to the movies. Why would I give money to corporations, or even small businesses, if they care nothing for my safety or the safety of my loved ones? Why shouldn't I hunker down for the next few years, and save every penny for a better day? 

The best way for those of you who want to go ""back to work"" or to ""restart the economy"" to get what you want is to show that you care for our well being--all of us--and are trustworthy on the facts. The best way is to prove we are all in this together.  If we're not--if many of us are expendable to you--then you, your business, and your income are expendable to us.

To prevent that from happening, I would use this time to set up large-scale temporary hospitals in whatever space is available -  conference centers ,etc. - and that all COVID-19 patents be transferred there. That way, if the system is overwhelmed by COVID 19 patients, it does not bring down the entire health care system with it.  The ""collapse"" would be contained with the temporary hospitals, while the existing permanent hospitals would continue to function."

In Norway some young children will return to school but others will continue online from their homes. The authorities will watch the data carefully over coming weeks.

Norway was early with countermeasures and has done more testing per capita than almost any country.  The enabled the country to get below 1 (currently estimated at .97) in infection reproduction rate. The country continues to have over 200 new cases a day and a slightly increasing # of deaths daily, with most things shut down.

The opening of some things is not without controversy or risk. The government here hopes to quickly act if and when the numbers indicate indicate greater than expected infections. There can be a couple weeks delay until the results of an action/inaction are plain in the data. It's a tough call.

Since a vaccine is at least 18 months away, we must find a way to use testing and ""track and trace"" methodologies to enable society to function at some level."

Tiny steps under a completely intact state of emergency sound so reasonable, but the reality is that any loosening at this very early stage will cost lives, and those lives will disproportionately come from the shop clerks and others at the bottom of the ladder.

Europe is arguably not yet at the peak, and even if it were, there is a very long downslope to go. 

Without on-demand limitless testing resources with results in hours, we are playing Russian roulette with five bullets in the chamber."

Every institution needs to find new ways to function. The virus has characteristics that challenge the most basic assumptions of our economic and social organisation. It is easily spread, is symptom-free in many cases (making it undetectable without proper medical tests) and although it has mild or no impact on most of us, it is lethal to perhaps 1%. There is no vaccine, nor any likely for months or years, if ever (there are no vaccines for other corona viruses) and there is no cure beyond symptomatic relief. Unless there is a globally applied vaccine, the chance of re-infection remains high. We are just not set up to deal with such a disease. 

Quite simply every aspect aspect of how we organise our lives, individually and collectively, is challenged."

We are about to send out the one group in our country that will have the hardest time adhering to hygiene and social distancing, and we know relatively little about the spreading of the virus when it comes to children. On top of that, the guidelines given to the nurseries, kindergartens and schools for the reopening are incredibly naïve (e.g. washing toys twice a day in kindergarten, and keeping the children separated in small groups).

On the plus side for us Americans, trump wont need it since his witch's brew of ""medicines"" he's on should make the vaccine pointless for him."
2020-04-08 17:19:33,"I come from Slovenia, a small country of 2 millions south of Austria and east of Italy. Our government, after inital confusion, thankfully acted quickly and shutdown the country on 13 of March. 
We have around 1000 people infected, 40 deaths and something around 30000 people tested. The government already promised a large financial aid package. 
There are plans that on tuesday some parts of country will be open - but more in terms of buissneses, production plants and shops, not yet schools or nurseries. 
For now I can say that we are just incredibly lucky and blessed, given the situation happening in larger, even economocially more developed countries. Reading about everything that is going on, I feel really sorry for each and every person that has faced dire consequences because of coronavirus."
2020-04-08 17:32:01,"Opening up businesses and schools, etc without a vaccine seems to simply mean we're willing for people to continue to get infected?"
2020-04-08 18:15:30,"The pressure to reopen the country is there, no question. I‘m glad that the Swiss government was and is very calm and also outspoken about the most realistic scenarios: This won‘t go away. There will be no exit as in ,back to normal‘. But we, the people have tremendous power. Our curve looks so much better and we were and still are not quarantined. Social distancing and common sense - that will be our future. Not too bad, right? But I have to admit that the Swiss are wealthy. It‘s easier to remain calm and levelheaded if you still got a job and healthcare."
2020-04-08 18:55:05,"Just a note that citizens of Czech Republic will be allowed to travel abroad, in some cases, but such people will have to stay in self-isolation after they return back. Violation of such mandatory quarantine may lead to fines higher than $100000. Touristic and similar non-essential visits to other countries are still prohibited. The aim is to allow people to visit their relatives abroad, for example.

Certain shops should open soon, but people visiting them must adhere to the rules of social distancing. Shops have to provide hand disinfectant for free at the entrance. People must enter one by one, not in groups, unless they are a family.

Many non-essential shops as well as restaurants, bars, cinemas, theatres, museums, libraries, sporting facilities remain closed.

Wearing a face mask is still mandatory on all public places, in public transport etc. Fines for not adhering to these rules may be as high as $500 or even more.

From what you can see at the public places, and according to the research run by certain institutions, most of the people here believe that increased personal responsibility is the best answer to the situation. So the fines for unallowed gathering or not wearing face masks are quite rare as the people here not only seem to understand their importance, but also want to demonstrate their willingness to fight the virus this way. At least is should not harm."
2020-04-08 19:08:12,"These are critical parts of an effective plan:

“likely to involve mandatory masks in enclosed public spaces and smartphone apps tracking contact with people who are potentially infected. Going back to work and traveling might be contingent on test results, and potentially the presence of antibodies that might provide a measure of immunity.”

We were originally told not to wear masks, not because they were not effective ( Drs want n95 masks because they are effective) but because there were not enough masks for everyone.

The virus will be with us for a while, and this will happen again.

We need to invest in the capacity to makeN95 masks for everyone.

Even if we open economy up, there are going to be lots of people wary of going out in public without adequate protection.

We were told it was the flu the first time. Now that lots of people have died, general populace unlikely to be that gullible again. 

The new normal is likely to require mask wearing, just like seatbelts and motorcycle helmets.

 Someone needs to make more masks."
2020-04-08 19:45:30,Put these countries that loosen their restrictions on an extended no entry into the U.S. until we get a handle on this. This is why lack of coordination with the rest of the world will put us in an endless loop of disease surge.
2020-04-08 19:45:59,"Life won't be normal for a long time - no sport events, no festivals, no octoberfest, no vacations in some exotic places. Even if we can go back to work, it is just to keep the economy alive. But everything else will be like under a permanent siege.
And the world economy will be devastated. Not to talk about the misery in some countries like india or brazil, or the middle east, and the unrest it can inflict.
We need a new plan for our society to get us through the next years. And it must be a plan, that leaves no one behind, which is hard to implement in some especially rich nations."
2020-04-08 19:48:04,Just as there is a distribution of disease severity there is a distribution of fear of infection.  The least fearful will be the first to revert to their normal routines.  The most fearful will continue to isolate and take strict precautions especially if they have the means to.  The shape of the distribution will have a large impact on how society operates before a vaccine becomes widely available.  I suspect that vulnerable seniors will dominate the latter group and young people the former group.
2020-04-08 19:55:36,"The 1st thing to do is to bolster the health and medical systems and all of the people in it. That is the least that they all deserve. All of the people need to included from custodial to clinicians. It would also seem to be imperative and now more than ever, that everyone in the country has normal access to the health care system, as in a regular doctor(prevention and wellness) as well as hospitalization(critical care).
Beyond that, we need to stop differentiating between one class or type of worker over another and value ALL who maintain employment with a wage that allows folks not just to survive but to actively participate and have at least the promise of a hopeful and meaningful life.
Let's get this right while there is still a chance for a middle class which is vanishing right before our eyes."
2020-04-08 20:36:58,"Much of what we've attempted here has already been an experiment. We have long known that separating people slows down contagion. This concept hardly requires an advanced degree in epidemiology. Yet we never attempted it before in a systematic way across the country, with school and business closures, event cancellations, and enforced social distancing, effectively shutting down much of the economy. We were so uncertain about the public response that the risk modeling failed to take into account our quite excellent adaptive social distancing behavior. So it appears we will have accomplished the obvious goal of saving many lives. Now we will have to adapt again as we reopen to undo the damage caused by the shutdown. I was always optimistic about the first part of the experiment and I remain so."
2020-04-08 20:44:05,"What these European countries are proposing to do may be a first good test that we can all learn from.  

Also, I think people are being a bit hysterical when they observe that the only sure way out of this is a vaccine, which may not be available for months or years, if ever.  What I believe is more certain is that treatments, including anti-viral drugs, will be developed (or confirmed to already exist) in fairly short order, and while they may not prevent people from contracting COVID-19, they will significantly reduce the risk of serious consequences or death to the most vulnerable and allow the world to resume some semblance of normalcy with only limited restrictions."
2020-04-08 20:05:11,Can we please stop all international flights into or out of these careless countries?
2020-04-08 20:14:04,Maybe Trump is right after all; i.e. begin slow release from lockdown around Easter.
2020-04-08 18:01:02,"Why is the New York Times the lockdown cheerleader?  Maybe it's because you are all still employed. Perhaps if you all stopped getting paid, your opinion might change."
2020-04-08 18:10:14,"Sending little kids back to school at this point is insane, just insane. Shut the schools down for the rest of the term and see where things stand for the Fall."
2020-04-08 18:58:00,"It's hard to see how abandoning social distancing will work without a vaccine or massive ""herd immunity"" which would come at the cost of a health care catastrophe.

Suppose Trump gets his way and the economy returns to something approaching normal on, say, May 1.  Then suppose that just 100 asymptomatic covid-19 patients circulate throughout the country, each one infecting just one other person each day.  The covid-19 incubation rate is estimated (no one seems to know for sure) to be between 2 and 14 days.  Let's split the difference and call it 7 days.

So on day #1 there are 100 asymptomatic patients.  On day  #2 the total rises to 200 people infected and keeps doubling for 7 days, when the total infected count will be 6,400 people.

At this point (day #8), 100 patients will exhibit symptoms, get tested, and be quickly quarantined.  That leaves 6,300 asymptomatic patients to infect another 6,300, so that at the start of day #9 there will 12,600 covid-19 patients.  But now the 200 patients from day #2 will show symptoms, get tested, and removed from circulation.

If this process continues on to day #15, over 1.4 million people will be infected.  If this exponential growth is allowed to explode by refusing to reestablish social distancing measures, it will take just one more week for over 100 million people to become infected.  Even if the death rate can be held to 1%, this means a million people will be condemned to death.

All of a sudden ""normal"" doesn't sound so good."
2020-04-08 20:12:48,"Sebastian Kurz of Austria illustrated what that new normal might look like when he announced “a step-by-step resurrection” .

Based on Kurz's politics and Austria's history I would suggest it would be more like a ""goose-step-by-goose-step""."
2020-04-08 20:24:19,To the few of you. Why this rush for opening up “the economy?” The whole world suffer. What marked do you believe is out there the next couple of months? Most of the world is closed down. The people save their money in times like this and even more of us is afraid for going out. What kind of marked do you believe you get from this scenario?
2020-04-08 17:47:28,"The Times needs to send a responsible message to US readers. But this isn't fair to Austria and Denmark. What Danish leader Frederiksen said is accurate: if you stand still on the tightrope, eventually you fall. People will not remain in total lockdown for the 18 months it takes to get a vaccine.

Quoting a single scientist who says immunity is a ""total illusion"" skews things. Your reporters must know that epidemiologists are producing study after study that show herd immunity is not only feasible, it's necessary. It's responsible to ensure the US public doesn't wane in its social distancing. But promoting incorrect information for that reason will surely backfire.

The US public may be hardening into a view that one can save either ""health"" or ""economy."" Democrats will say without health, economic recovery is impossible. Republicans will say without economic activity, everything breaks down, including healthcare. We love polarity. Maybe the media does, too.

But this isn't reality. Herd immunity is needed. That requires 60% or more of the population to get the disease. People under 50, not immuno-compromised, make up the cohort. Their mortality rates are influenza-like, which is no cake walk. But potentially manageable. 

I can't pretend to know how that will proceed. It's like we're building a net under the tight-walk as we walk on it. OK, not as poetic as Frederiksen. Useful metaphors are your job, NY Times. Please start inventing some that include herd immunity."
2020-04-08 19:23:00,"This is all premature. Similar to the exuberance on Wall Street today and yesterday. You cannot even buy bleach, sanitizing wipes and hand sanitizers! Lifting “stay in place” will cost many lives including among the advocates. The second wave of the 1918 pandemic should be a warning."
2020-04-08 17:30:58,It’s worth pointing out the early and mandatory use of masks in Austria and the Czech Republic.
2020-04-08 19:43:54,"If we want to restart the economy we can’t do it without answers to the following questions:

1. Do people who have recovered  from the virus have immunity. Today Mayor De Blasio announced that 276 members of the NYPD are fully recovered from Corona Virus and back on the job. add to that 1,310 members of the FDNY and EMTs, all fully recovered and back to work, soon they will be joined by hundreds of recovered nurses and doctors. We will soon learn in a big way if they are now blessed with immunity. I put nothing past this devils virus, but science says they will have some form of immunity.

2. Why are some cases mild and others very severe, is there one thing that all the severe cases have in common, some say the severe cases get a higher dose of the virus 

3. Is there a drug that acts as a preventative. We need to know if any Lupus patients have contracted the virus.If they have was it mild. Lupus patients take the drug hydroxychloroquine, and it was doctors in China that first noticed that their patients with Lupus seemed resistant to Corona virus . We need to know if this is true.

4. How effective  are masks to stopping the spread of Corona virus, most countries where masks are mandatory have very low totals. Can masks act as a big preventative.

5. Why did New York blow up but California didn’t what can we learn from that

We have plenty of questions but few answers but those answers are the key to our immediate future."
2020-04-08 20:09:58,"This is going to end badly. In typical fashion, 21st century humans just don’t want to be all that inconvenienced. Easing up on an impressive and effective worldwide lockdown now will be a disaster. And COVID-19 is gonna love it."
2020-04-08 20:18:29,"Well, no one knows what will happen with this virus.  That is the scary part---it's ALL unknown and no vaccine if we make a mistake.  It will be interesting to see how China and these European countries do opening their cities up a little bit."
2020-04-08 20:59:13,Before they lose up they should have a massive testing program in place.  Test all all the 3 prior days contacts of every newly diagnosed patient.  Hold them quarantined until the results are back - and retest them 3 days later.  This approach seems to have worked in South Korea and Hong Kong to bring case numbers down to something manageable - without killing the economy.
2020-04-08 17:39:36,"Controlled reopening is an attempt to make the fight against covid sustainable which requires a certain amount of risk. An extended complete shutdown will kill an economy. A functioning economy is key to a functioning health care system. It’s either we sit in lockdown to wait this out and lose our systems that are keeping people alive - Or we take a managed risk approach, specific to vulnerable populations and regional outbreak controls, including massive scale testing and new supply chains for medical ppe and equipment. As well as improving communication, something this newspaper has been poorly contributing since the start of the pandemic. This newspaper is still behind in their thought process. It’s time to catch up to Europe who are weeks ahead in planning."
2020-04-08 18:56:04,"In the U.S. it's difficult to know that the president, who is completely devoid of empathy, is making the decision to reopen the country. He sits in a cocoon-like safe zone in the White House where no one gets close to him without first having their temperature taken. He has no empathy with the death and destruction happening outside his cocoon. He just wants everything back to normal so he can win re-election in November and the stock market hits new highs."
2020-04-08 20:05:35,"Obviously China restarting is the true place to watch. Restaurants are already reopening in China, with all kinds of differences, including tables stationed far apart, waiters,  cashiers and cooks  wearing masks. Temperatures are checked repeatedly. And it seems to be working.
  Disney says when the time comes to open Disneyland, there will be changes, social distancing on lines, temperature Checks etc, Disney is trying to learn from China, as are many restaurants, and shops.

But how do you restart the airline industry. Planes, in many ways got us into this mess, they brought the virus to our country and very quickly, Planes are perfect Virus incubators. And if the world is not careful Planes will start a second wave

What about broadway and movie theaters. The only way it could work is spacing the people in the theaters, but that’s a lot of empty seats.

Then there is the other virus incubators, schools. How are you going to reopen schools. Many school teachers are in the age range of those most at risk to serious complications from the virus.

What about professional sports?

Rapid testing will help, so will masks,, and when I say mask I mean N95s, antibody testing will also help. And you never know a breakthrough in treatment may come, it happened with AIDS.

We failed to learn from Europe and Asia in phase one - the spread of the virus, let’s hope we can learn from phase two, the reopening of society."
2020-04-08 20:22:04,Big mistake.  Having everyone on the same page  is the only solution.  Learning patience is infinitely preferable to a do over. The global economy is united for better or for worse.

Politicians who are afraid of looking like they haven't done enough."
2020-04-08 19:50:56,"Kurz is a cheap, uneducated (his highest level of education is a highschool diploma) populist and his statement “Austria acted quicker and more decisively than other countries"" is a total joke. Kurz knew about infections at the ski resort of Ischgl and although the government of Iceland (several of their countrypeople got infected there) warned them early, he did not enforce the closing of  the ski resort and bars. The consequence was that hundreds of Europeans were infected in Austria and dozens died. All would have been preventable if Kurz wouldn´t have put some more business at a ski resort over the health of many, many people. Now to claim that Austria ""acted quicker"" is a lie that the relatives of the dead would definitely not support."
2020-04-08 18:59:32,"These leaders are risking their people's welfare but they seem to know it and are uneasy about it. Risky but it's being done with the awareness that it may be the wrong move, and so there may need to be a return to shutdowns. 

Mr. Trump is terrified from the political risks to himself of both too many dead or of too much economic malaise. However, he will not express his concerns that easing off on the shutdowns may bring avoidable deaths, he will assure all that the crisis is over and to feel free to return to normal because he'd rather express nonsense with confidence than to admit self doubt to be honest."
2020-04-08 21:17:20,"Meanwhile, the French government is tightening its grip .
From today, we are no longer allowed outside to exercise or walk our dogs, between ten in the morning and seven in the evening . 
It is 27 degrees celcius and the apartments are small, some even so tiny that the square meters are counted with digits, a studio of 11.7 Sq Meters on the sixth floor, in a walk up, can feel claustrophobic and get hot . Very hot .
The small apartments, combined with general joie de vivre, is the reason the French daily life is spend outdoors, in the many parks of Paris and at cafes and restaurants .
That is not allowed and the latest restrictions are justified, as it will be warm and sunny and the authorities want to prevent people from putting themselves and others at risk . 
One for all and all for one .
The military and police are always visible in France , these days more than ever, as the Parisian police enjoy being out on bikes and rollerskates, having the boulevards and avenues all to themselves . They are out to check peoples documents, we have to present a document that explains why we have descended from the sixth floor . We have a couple of valid reason to be out, if we stay within a distance of one kilometer from the home .
In the old days, people would say,"" in God we trust"" , these days we have to trust our governments, and help science with a little prayer . If this challenge can`t be solved, it is going to be a very hot summer .Both at the sixth  and everywhere else ."
2020-04-08 21:43:12,"It stands to reason that at some point some level of commerce is going to have to resume.  That being said, just flipping the switch and going ""back to normal"" is highly unlikely.  For example, international travel needs to be severely curtailed for the foreseeable future.  Small nations in Europe can probaby manage this disease much easier than a large country like the U.S.  The smaller the country and population, the easier it is to test and track those that are infected.  Unless we all want to surrender to a level of surveillance that would make China proud, we are going to have to adjust our way of life until a vaccine is found."
2020-04-08 22:18:14,"At some point we MUST release the lockdown in Europe. All of Europe's economies are taking. There are millions of unemployed or underemployed. The tourism industry - one of the biggest engines of the European economy - is all but dead, just ahead of the summer season. The automotive industry is comatose, the markets in some countries having shrunk as much as 90%. Europe hasn't seen such an utter destruction of business value since World War II. I work in a business with a long business cycle and we are lucky not to be affected in terms of revenue, but most people I know are seeing their businesses hit very hard. Many are already working part-time, and those who run their businesses are laying off hundreds of people out of sheer necessity.

So the total lockdown (and the senseless closure of internal borders - as if that achieved anything at all since the virus is everywhere) has to be lifted, and sensible measures need to replace it. If it means that we have to use masks in public places, be it; if it means that airplanes must fly only 50% full, the airlines will need to be financially supported at least until a vaccine is found; the same for railways and other means of public transport. But we cannot freeze the economy and keep 500 million people ""jailed"" for months or years. If the current draconian policies continue, by this summer the coronavirus will be the last of our worries, because the entire European economy will have imploded with no hope of recovery."
2020-04-08 22:30:21,"We need to start opening up the country by end of April.

We’ve already seen its results, and chances of flareups are very high.       Mass transit has suddenly become a game of Russian roulette, as has the vulnerable internet network that is allowing working from home.    Hacking of intelligence agencies and corporate intellectual property by Russia, China, North Korea, Israel  and others remains high.

Numerous drugs and combinations of drugs are being tested agains COVID-19. Developers are optimistic that we will have medicines effective against the virus by midsummer. Researcher tracking genetic changes in COVOD-19 say the virus is relatively stable. It mutates at one-third to half the rate of flu. This means that a COVID-19 vaccinations, once developed, will be far more effective than flu vaccines, which are only partially effective. It also means that, once infected by COVID-19, survivors are likely than flu survivors to be immune or partially immune to future generations of COVID-19.

A significant decrease in deaths and hospitalizations over more than a few days. The availability of widespread testing with quick results. The ability to track new cases, their contacts and place them in enforceable quarantine, regardless of symptom status. 

Normal is not going to happen for many months. Some of the deaths are going to be to people who are critical to their business, especially the smaller firms. Those who recover from serious cases are not going to be 100% for weeks, if ever.
